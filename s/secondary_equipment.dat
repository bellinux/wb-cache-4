Before a level begins, the player may choose {{the primary and}} <b>secondary</b> <b>equipment</b> they wish to begin the level with. Only one of each type of equipment can be equipped at once. Primary equipment consists of an oxygen mask and tank and three types of fire extinguishers that correspond to {{the different types of}} fires that can be encountered in the game; regular, chemical, and electrical. These fires and their extinguishers are red-orange, green, and blue, respectively. As these are used, a counter goes from 99 to 0. The counter of the regular extinguisher rapidly increases back to 99 after a brief period of inactivity, while the oxygen tank and mask and the other extinguishers can only go back to 99 after being resupplied by allies in the level. <b>Secondary</b> <b>equipment</b> consists of a trusty fireman's axe, a rope for crossing gaps, a metal pole to reveal holes by checking for weak places in the floor, plastic explosives to blow through debris and certain wall sections, and CO2 bombs to extinguish large areas of fire. Only five plastic explosives and CO2 bombs can be carried at one time and can be replenished by an ally on the map.|$|E

The cloud at substation level receives the data from process level, and the regional cloud receives the data from the information platform, which includes static, dynamic, transient measurements and states of circuit breakers, extracting valuable information and allocating them to various specially-designed computation algorithms in the platform to perform advanced functions in order to identify the faulted line, the accurate fault location and the contents of harmonics, etc.|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of process {{information in the}} power system is significant. A wide technological development of microprocessors {{at the end of}} the last century led to the introduction of intelligent electronic devices (IED) in the power system. Classical <b>secondary</b> <b>equipment</b> (protection, measurement and control) lacks communication capabilities so it communicates via a remote terminal unit (RTU) with the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system. Furthermore, an introduction of IEDs with embedded communication has enabled vertical and horizontal multidimensional data exchange between secondary devices. Although a standard-based communication solution solved the primary obstacle to unambiguous data exchange between different <b>secondary</b> <b>equipment.</b> A traditional approach in managing the power system is based on the assumption that each basic function has its own <b>secondary</b> <b>equipment</b> for data acquisition and processing. An introduction of new IEDs has opened the possibility of a new concept of multidimensional data integration and information exchange.

30|$|The {{current and}} voltage signals on the {{secondary}} side of electromagnetic instrument transformers are {{transferred to the}} protection device through the secondary cable. Accordingly, the increase of the <b>secondary</b> <b>equipment</b> requires an increasing of secondary cable for connecting instrument transformer. The interlocking and blocking signals between secondary equipments, and the commands and signals between protection and circuit breaker are also transferred in one-to-one characteristics through secondary cable wiring. The relay protections and secondary circuits are configured according to bays. Each bay is naturally and physically independent, {{so that it is}} relatively easy to realize the isolation of faulty <b>secondary</b> <b>equipment</b> and circuits, hence the system will have relatively high reliability. On the other hand, it is relatively difficult to realize information intercommunication among all bays, repeated utilization of current and voltage quantities, interlocking and blocking information, as well as operation information. In order to realize the protection functions using multi-bay information, many secondary cables shall be added, thus the implementation is relatively difficult, which will restrict the functional improvement, optimization and supplementation of existing protection system.|$|E

30|$|Risk {{assessment}} of hidden failure. As members of <b>secondary</b> <b>equipment,</b> relay protections and SSCDs {{are a part}} of operational risk sources of power grid. Until now, the severity {{assessment of}} the effect of hidden failures in the relay protection on power grid is generally carried out based on the point of risk. According to the ideas of risk assessment proposed in the research with achievements, such as research on power grid faults caused by lighting [45], hidden failures of <b>secondary</b> <b>equipment</b> will be treated as a new input to assess risk online and analyze the security of power grid, which will be a new trend to study hidden failures. The modeling and analysis of hidden failures in the relay protection and SSCS need the support of large amounts of operating data, but the categorization of operating data is not complete, and the expert knowledge is of ambiguity and uncertainty. To acquire adequate data it needs to reinforce the unified management of the monitoring and accident record of secondary system. However that’s not enough. New methods should also be explored simultaneously to evaluate the risk of hidden failure under the condition of data deficiency.|$|E
