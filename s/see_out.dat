Robson revealed on 7 May 2007 he had been diagnosed with cancer for the fifth time. On 17 May 2008, Robson was the guest of honour at the 2008 FA Cup Final at Wembley Stadium when Portsmouth defeated Cardiff City 1–0. He presented the trophy to the victorious captain, Sol Campbell.|$|E
5|$|When Adams {{resigned}} as manager in October 2004, Craig Levein was appointed boss. This {{would prove to}} be an unsuccessful period and after 15 months in charge, Levein was sacked, having failed to get the Foxes anywhere near the promotion places. Assistant manager Rob Kelly took over as caretaker manager, and after winning three out of four matches, was appointed to <b>see</b> <b>out</b> the rest of the season. Kelly steered Leicester to safety and in April 2006 was given the manager's job on a permanent basis.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{recruitment}} of Tomáš Ujfaluši and Johnny Heitinga pushed Pablo down the pecking order, he finished the 2008–09 season with 21 league appearances. An offer from Real Zaragoza of less than €5m {{was rejected by the}} club as insufficient, but despite the arrival of Juanito adding to the defensive competition, Pablo said he was happy to <b>see</b> <b>out</b> the remaining year of his contract. In that final season, he played rarely. He took part in the early rounds of the Copa del Rey and in the group stage of the Champions League as Atlético finished third in their group and dropped into the Europa League, but made his last appearance for the club, as a late substitute, on 20 December 2009.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{tactical}} battle Liverpool {{were able to}} score in the 81st minute. A throw-in from Ray Kennedy found Alan Kennedy, whose run up the left hand side of the pitch caught Real off-guard. Kennedy went past Real defender Rafael García Cortés into the Real box, his subsequent shot beat the Real goalkeeper to give Liverpool the lead. Soon afterwards Liverpool replaced Dalglish with midfielder Jimmy Case {{in an attempt to}} <b>see</b> <b>out</b> the match. Although Liverpool had chances to extend their lead as Real went all out to score, Real keeper Agustín Rodríguez made a number of saves to keep his team in the game. The score remained 1–0 and Liverpool won their third European Cup, the first British club to do so. Liverpool's victory meant that Bob Paisley became the first manager to win the European Cup three times.|$|E
5|$|Having {{made the}} journey to Egypt {{travelling}} via South Africa and the Red Sea due {{to the threat of}} attack that was present in the Mediterranean, the battalion arrived just before New Years. The 18th Brigade was again reassigned in February 1941, this time to the 7th Division, with whom they would <b>see</b> <b>out</b> the remainder of the war; at the same time, the brigade was converted from a four-battalion structure to three, and the 2/11th was transferred to help form the 19th Brigade. On 21 March 1941, the battalion undertook its first ground action of the war, when one of its companies– 'D' Company– supported the 2/9th Battalion in their attack on the Italian held fort at Giarabub. The battalion's first major action as a complete unit did not come until April 1941, though, when it undertook defensive actions during the Siege of Tobruk. During the Battle of the Salient, fought in early May, the 2/10th took over a position on the northern flank of the perimeter, relieving the 2/48th Battalion, coming under heavy air attack during the handover.|$|E
5|$|Jordan persuaded Hill to {{at least}} stay for the British Grand Prix. Going into that race weekend, Hill {{announced}} he would retire after the Grand Prix, leading Jordan to test Jos Verstappen in case Hill had to be quickly replaced. Following a strong fifth place at his home event, however, Hill {{changed his mind and}} decided to <b>see</b> <b>out</b> the year. His best result {{for the remainder of the}} season was sixth place, which he achieved in both Hungary and Belgium. With three races of 1999 to go, there were rumours that the Prost Grand Prix team would release Jarno Trulli early after he signed for Jordan's 2000 campaign as Hill's replacement. At the same time, his teammate, Frentzen, became a title contender going into the final few races of the season and, eventually, finished third in the championship. In so doing, both Hill and Frentzen helped Jordan to achieve its best-ever finish with a third position in the constructor's championship. Hill's last race was the Japanese Grand Prix where he spun off the track and pulled into the pits citing mental fatigue.|$|E

5|$|On 24 June 1982, British Airways Flight 9, a Boeing 747-200 {{registration}} G-BDXH, {{flew through}} {{a cloud of}} volcanic ash and dust from the eruption of Mount Galunggung. The ash and dust caused extensive damage to the aircraft, including the failure of all four engines. The crew managed to glide the plane out of the dust cloud and restart all four of its engines, although one later had {{to be shut down}} again. The volcanic ash caused the cockpit window to be scratched {{to such an extent that}} it was difficult for the pilots to <b>see</b> <b>out</b> of the plane. However, the aircraft made a successful emergency landing at Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport just outside Jakarta. There were no fatalities or injuries.|$|E
5|$|Portuguese side Porto {{were the}} {{opposition}} in the quarter-finals. The first leg in Portugal ended 0–0. Liverpool won the second leg at Anfield 2–0 with Danny Murphy and Michael Owen scoring {{in the first half}} to progress to the semi-finals courtesy of a 2–0 aggregate victory. Liverpool were drawn against Spanish side Barcelona in the semi-finals. Liverpool defended resolutely during the first leg at Barcelona's ground the Camp Nou to earn a 0–0 draw. The second leg at Anfield was equally close, until the 44th minute when Liverpool were awarded a penalty. Gary McAllister scored the subsequent penalty to put Liverpool 1–0 up in the match and the tie. However, a Barcelona goal would see them progress {{as a result of the}} away goals rule. Liverpool managed to <b>see</b> <b>out</b> the 90 minutes without conceding a goal to progress to their first European final, since they were banned from participating in Europe following the Heysel Stadium disaster at the 1985 European Cup Final.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2010–11 season, Diarra was heavily linked with a move to the champions Marseille. On 14 July, Marseille manager Didier Deschamps {{confirmed}} that the club was negotiating with both Diarra and Bordeaux for a transfer. A week later, Bordeaux president Triaud stated that Marseille had failed to meet the player's €7.75million release clause and that Diarra was likely not going to be leaving the club. Despite Marseille remaining hopeful a deal could go through, on 30 July, a deal was declared dead. Diarra later stated that he was happy to remain at Bordeaux and <b>see</b> <b>out</b> the rest of his contract. The defensive midfielder opened the new campaign scoring two goals in the first six matches of the season in wins over Paris Saint-Germain and Lyon.|$|E

5|$|Scores {{of three}} not out, 28, 27, 35 and four {{followed}} before his next significant score, 52, against Queensland on 12 February 1937. He ended {{the season with}} 336runs, one century, and an average of 30.54. He then suffered his worst period of form thus far {{at the start of}} the 193738 season, failing to reach double figures from 17 December 1937 until early January 1938, when he scored 64 in the second innings, against Victoria. He followed this with 49 against New South Wales, and ended his third season with 283runs at an average of 21.76. He did not play another cricket match until 16 December 1938 {{at the start of the}} next season, however he returned with a score of 90 against New South Wales, and followed that up two matches later with 84 against Victoria. He narrowly missed out on his third century in November 1939 when he was caught by Morris Sievers for 99 against Victoria. He scored 41, 12, 6 and 20 to <b>see</b> <b>out</b> the rest of the year, ending with 239runs at an average of 47.80, his most successful full season thus far.|$|E
5|$|With 17minutes remaining, a Birmingham chance arose when Murphy outpaced Dave Ewing. Goalkeeper Trautmann dived at {{the feet}} of Murphy to win the ball, but in the {{collision}} Murphy's right knee hit Trautmann's neck with a forceful blow. Trautmann was knocked unconscious, and the referee stopped play immediately. Trainer Laurie Barnett rushed onto the pitch, and treatment continued for several minutes. No substitutes were permitted, so Manchester City would have to <b>see</b> <b>out</b> the game with ten men if Trautmann was unable to continue. Captain Roy Paul felt certain that Trautmann was not fit to complete the match, and wished to put Roy Little in goal instead. However, Trautmann, dazed and unsteady on his feet, insisted upon keeping his goal. He played out the remaining minutes in great pain, with the Manchester City defenders attempting to clear the ball well upfield or into the stand whenever it came near. Trautmann was called upon to make two further saves to deny Brown and Murphy, the second causing him to recoil in agony due to a collision with Ewing, which required the trainer to revive him.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, {{he moved}} to Second Division Grimsby Town. Though now playing in the {{professional}} Football League, Chapman was still an amateur at this stage and obtained {{a job with a}} firm of local solicitors to earn his way. Grimsby started the season poorly – they were {{near the bottom of the}} division by Christmas and were beaten 7–0 by Preston North End in the FA Cup, but rallied to finish tenth at the end of the 1898–99 season. By this time Chapman had been dropped from the team, having been unsuccessfully moved to centre forward, an unfamiliar position for him. He was released by Grimsby and drifted down into non-league football with a brief spell at Swindon Town, playing three games and scoring twice, but had to leave the club as he was unable to find a job in the area. He moved on to <b>see</b> <b>out</b> the season with Sheppey United, who finished bottom of the Southern League in 1899–1900. Chapman finished as United's top scorer but was injured at the end of this season, and still unable to find a job. Disheartened, he returned to his home town and turned out for Worksop Town of the Midland League in 1900–01, while resuming his studies, this time at Old Firth College in Sheffield.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to find the {{equalising}} goal, United manager Alex Ferguson moved Giggs from the centre of midfield to the left in order to restore the width of his team and brought on striker Dwight Yorke for Butt. Yorke would spearhead the attack with Van Nistelrooy, a partnership that worked on the club's pre-season tour of Asia. United had another chance in the 68th minute, but Scholes was unable to beat Westerveld, who saved his shot. Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier made his first substitutions of the match soon after; in an attempt to regain control of possession, he brought on Igor Bišćan and Patrik Berger to replace Barmby and Murphy. Liverpool's first chance of the half came in the 81st minute, Bišćan and Owen exchanged passes, before Bišćan shot wide of the goal. United went straight on the attack and a goal-bound shot by Keane was saved by Westerveld. Liverpool replaced Riise with defender Jamie Carragher minutes later in order to <b>see</b> <b>out</b> the game. A minute later, referee D'Urso declined to award United a penalty for the second time when Van Nistelrooy's shot appeared to be blocked by the arm of Henchoz. United continued to push forward for an equaliser, but a long-range shot by Irwin, which went wide, was their only notable chance before the match ended. Liverpool won 2–1 to win the Shield for the 14th time.|$|E
5|$|The camera {{work and}} editing work {{together}} to further heighten the frightening qualities of the film. Eleanor is often viewed from above, and in one scene the camera closes in so tightly on her that she is forced backward over a railing. Eleanor's viewpoint is often juxtaposed with eerie views of the house, as if both viewpoints were the same. Many of the editing choices in the film are also used to heighten the audience's discomfort. There {{are a number of}} rapid cuts in the film that throw off the viewer's sense of spatial orientation, and Dutch angles are used to imply that reality is off-kilter. Cutting on action—showing the characters exiting a room to the right, only to show them entering the next room from the left—is often violated, so that the viewer cannot get a clear sense of which rooms and hallways are connected to one another. The audience also lacks temporal clues. There are few shots in which they can <b>see</b> <b>out</b> a window to determine whether it's night or day. When Eleanor is rescued by Dr. Markway on the unstable spiral staircase, some of the windows nearby show strong sunlight streaming in, while others show darkness outside.|$|E
