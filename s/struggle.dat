Examining the interconnections among collective identity <b>struggles,</b> land <b>struggles</b> and state policies and practices in post-apartheid South Africa, this paper argues that the government 2 ̆ 7 s contradictory policies and ambivalent practices have aggravated collective <b>struggles</b> over the boundaries of belonging. Specifically, the differing definitions of community set forth in traditional leadership, land tenure and land restitution policies exacerbate existing divisions among ‘communities’ concurrently subject to these policies and create practical policy dilemmas for decision-makers. This paper illustrates the interplay between public policies and collective identity <b>struggles</b> through close examination of <b>struggles</b> among the Barokologadi ba ga Maotwe, a so-called traditional community.

5|$|The various dissidents {{formed a}} pro-Thi, anti-Kỳ {{organization}} called the Military-Civilian <b>Struggle</b> Committee, {{better known as the}} <b>Struggle</b> Movement. Their message and influence quickly spread as they called for the end of military rule and took over radio stations and government buildings in I Corps. They intensified their calls for Kỳ to fulfil his promise to hold democratic elections. Some I Corps units supportive of Thi then decided to join the <b>Struggle</b> Movement and ceased military operations against the Vietcong, instead starting a stand-off against Kỳ. Throughout April and May there were tense incidents as units loyal to the junta were flown in from Saigon, and the factions came close to warfare.|$|E

By June, ARVN loyalists, {{with the help of the}} American forces, prevailed. Their superior numbers convinced many in the <b>Struggle</b> Movement to back down and realign with the government, and those who refused were militarily defeated, often in bitter street-to-street fighting. While the <b>Struggle</b> Movement was finally ebbing away, Thi agreed to meet with Kỳ at an American air base in Chu Lai to reach a settlement, seeing as the junta was going to prevail in any case. Thi agreed to the original offers of subsidies and the cover story of a medical trip.|$|E
