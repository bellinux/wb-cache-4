Fishes and sea anemones {{were obtained from}} the traders and maintained in a conditioning tank. After pair formation, they laid eggs in the <b>spawning</b> <b>tank,</b> which were sticky, capsule shaped and yellow orange in colour. The eggs were allowed to remain in the same tank till hatching up to eight days for incubation. Spawning, embryonic development, hatching success, larval survival and juvenile production were studied in detail. Optimum water quality parameters were also standardized for the hatchery operations. The size range of newly hatched larvae measured 3. 5 to 3. 8 mm in length and they were transferred to separate larval rearing tanks. The first white band was prominent on the body between 15 to 17 th day, an indication of metamorphosis. The complete metamorphosis was occurred on 25 th day after hatching. The larvae were initially fed with micro-algae, rotifers, Artemia nauplii and later they accepted frozen Artemia and squashed boiled meat of oysters and clams.

On {{the basis of these}} trials, the productivity and economic performance of various production strategies for hormonally sex-reversed Oreochromis fry (MT fry) were then compared and modelled for adoption in Central and Northeast Thailand. Regular disturbance and harvesting of seed after a short period of spawning opportunity (5 - 10 days) was found to increase seed production in concrete <b>spawning</b> <b>tanks.</b> Exchange of female broodfish increased synchrony of breeding. A change in conditioning and spawning environment had no effect on seed yield from <b>spawning</b> <b>tanks</b> and hapas (area = 12. 57 m 2 and 40 m 2 respectively). Seed wet weight, seed clutch size and weight was greater in female fish <b>spawned</b> in <b>tanks</b> than hapas. Females conditioned in hapas however produced heavier seed clutches of larger absolute and relative size than tank conditioned fish. Records of tagged females indicated considerable differences in the frequency of spawning; in hapas the distribution was normal wheras in tanks it was skewed. The evidence suggests that hierarchy is important in the control of reproduction and exerts it's strongest effect in clear water, densely stocked tanks. Selective female broodfish exchange optimised seed yield per unit weight of broodfish and seed production was not improved by conditioning females for periods longer than 10 days. Male broodfish exchange did not significantly improve (P > 0. 05) seed yields. Early nutrition of broodfish raised under different supplemental feeding regimes in fertilised earthen ponds had a significant effect on later spawning frequency in concrete tanks. However, this effect was confined to broodfish maintained at densities lower or higher than optimal for seed production. Broodfish stocked over a range of densities for extended periods (201 days) showed greater variability of seed production in hapa than tank production systems. This was mainly due to periods of poor water quality in hapas; when water quality was high seed production was significantly higher in hapas than tanks over a range of broodfish densities. The optimal density of broodfish for seed production was exceeded in tanks but not hapas. The relationship between seed production and broodfish density over time suggested that both stocking biomass and number have an effect on fry output. Density of broodfish showed an inverse relationship to clutch size in both tanks and hapas and synchrony of <b>spawning</b> in <b>tanks.</b> Production of swim-up fry in large earthen ponds (area= 1740 m 2) was not significantly different (P> 0. 05) at 2 levels of harvest intensity.

A commercial scale incubation system was devised and evaluated in order to allow tank and hapa systems harvesting unhatched seed to be compared with the production of swim-up fry obtained from earthen ponds.

40|$|Background: Fluoxetine (ProzacTM) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{antidepressant}} that can be released to aquatic systems via sewage-treatment effluents. It is suspected to provoke substantial effects in the aquatic environment. Methods: In <b>spawning</b> <b>tanks,</b> specimens were exposed to concentrations of 0 and 0. 54 µgl- 1 fluoxetine from male introduction until the larvae had hatched. Prior to spawning, nest area and time spent for nest building were measured. Also, spawning duration, number of copulations per spawning and eggs per copulation, total produced eggs and hatching rate were recorded. Results: The number of copulations, eggs per copulation and total produced eggs did not differ between the two treatments. Fluoxetine treatment significantly decreased the nest size, time spent for nest building and spawning duration. Also hatching rate was significantly lower during fluoxetine treatment than in the control condition. Notably, five fluoxetine treated males cannibalized their eggs and larvae. Conclusion: We showed that environmental exposure of fighting fish to fluoxetine potentially alters specific aspects of nest building and sexual behavior and, as a consequence, reproductive output. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract only. The {{culture of}} grass shrimp, Penaeus monodon {{has become a}} fast-growing {{enterprise}} in Taiwan since formulated shrimp feed was successfully developed in 1978. In 1983, the total postlarval production for stocking reached 600 million {{at the price of}} 12. 5 U. S. cents each. This high price of the postlarvae resulted from (1) limited availability of wild gravid females, (2) undesirable spawnings obtained by using the method of eyestalk ablation, manifested by a low average hatching rate of 20 %, and (3) high demand from grow-out farms. The eyestalk ablated females induced to spawn were often found unmated which partly explained the poor spawnings and low hatching rates. Consequently, re-use of ablated females was not practised by farmers in the past. The present paper describes the results of artificial insemination and fertilization of wild or pond-reared females whose gonadal development was induced by eyestalk ablation. The hatching rates from unmated soft-thelycum females implanted with two spermatophores are 84. 7 % and 43. 7 % while those implanted with only one spermatophore, 74. 1 % and 16. 8 %, for the first and subsequent spawning, respectively. These results positively confirm that the unmated condition of ablated females is the main reason for low hatching. Through artificial insemination, the spawning and hatching can be improved and ablated females can be re-utilized. For unmated hard-thelycum females, artificial fertilization was done by releasing spermatozoa into the <b>spawning</b> <b>tank</b> right before spawning. Out of 15 attempts, three were successful with hatching rates of 63. 1, 52. 3, and 49. 9 %. Induced maturation of pond-reared shrimps was attempted by manipulation of temperature and salinity. Under constant temperature of 22 Â± 2 Â°C, salinities ranging between 25 and 37 ppt were experimented. The best results with 67 % success were obtained at salinities of 30 and 35 ppt.

40|$|Parentage {{assignment}} {{is becoming increasingly}} popular {{as a means of}} monitoring the effects of aquaculture husbandry practices. As the complexity of such studies increase, likelihood-based methods for assignment are coming to the fore since, theoretically at least, they offer the possibility of accurate assignment with less screening overheads (fewer loci, less cost) compared to exclusion-based methods. We were able to explore this assertion through the analysis of the parental contribution to 300 Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) fiy produced from a commercial mass <b>spawning</b> <b>tank</b> (containing 99 broodstock) on a single day. Five polymorphic DNA microsatellite loci were screened and three different datasets generated: 'error prone' raw genotypic data from automated allele calling; manually corrected data; and corrected data from a reduced number of loci (four). Parentage analysis was performed by three software packages-PAPA, CERVUS and FAP-which all have been used in aquaculture contexts. PAPA and CERVUS perform likelihood-based analyses, while FAP is exclusion-based. Striking differences in the allocation performance were noted both among programs and among datasets. With no allowance for error all three programs flagged up potential problems within datasets, particularly the error prone 'raw' genotypes. When allowance for a presumed low level of error was invoked using PAPA (uniform error rate = 0. 0001 - 0. 02) parentage was assigned for virtually all offspring, irrespective of the dataset used. Despite simulations suggesting that these assignments were likely to be accurate (correctness values > 95 %) substantial numbers of assignments (up to 18 %) differed among the datasets. FAP gave more conservative (maximum of c. 78 % of assignments resolved) and consistent assignments. The power of assignment declined significantly when only four loci were considered. CERVUS performed relatively poorly in terms of numbers of assignments made. Where comparisons were possible most of the identified parental-pairs agreed with FAP allocations. Reliance on likelihood-based assignments alone to resolve parentage in complex mass spawning tanks may be inappropriate. Furthermore, reducing the number of loci to a minimal set (based on likelihood predictions) could be counterproductive. Allocation methods should be more thoroughly assessed and fully described.

40|$|Intensive {{aquaculture}} of Atlantic cod is fast {{developing in}} both Northern Europe and Canada. The {{last six years}} have seen major improvements in the larval rearing protocols and husbandry techniques for this species. Although breeding programmes are currently being developed by both governmental and private institutions in the main cod producing countries (i. e. Norway, Iceland and Canada), most hatcheries still rely on the mass spawning of their own broodstock. Mass <b>spawning</b> <b>tanks</b> are complex systems where fish are left to spawn naturally and fertilised eggs are collected with the overflowing water, {{with little or no}} control over the matings of the animals. Few published studies in other commercial marine species (i. e. turbot and sole) have attempted to analyse the output from such systems using microsatellite markers and several parentage analysis software programs. A review of these publications exposed a lack of consistency in the methods used to analyse such complex datasets. This problem was addressed by carrying out a detailed comparison of two analytical principals (i. e. assignment by strict exclusion and assignment by probabilities) and four parentage software programmes (i. e. FAP, VITASSIGN, CERVUS and PAPA), using the DNA profiles, at 5 loci, from 300 cod fry issued from the mass spawning of a large hatchery cod broodstock tank (consisting of 99 fish). This study revealed large discrepancies in the allocation outcomes between exclusion-based and probability-based assignments caused by the important rate of typing errors present in the dataset. Out of the four softwares tested, FAP (Taggart, 2007) was the most appropriate to use for handling such a dataset. It combined the most conservative method of assignment with the most informative output for the results displayed. In an attempt to study the breeding dynamics in a cod commercial hatchery, parental contributions to five groups of 300 fry (from five single days of spawning and from two commercial mass <b>spawning</b> cod <b>tanks)</b> were analysed, based on the genotyping data from eight loci.

Chapter 2 Zebrafish in our laboratory are usually bred {{by removing the}} fish from the recirculating aquatic system and placing them into 1 - 2 L spawning tanks. These spawning tanks consist of a bottom reservoir, a lid, and an insert that fits in closely into the bottom reservoir. When the fish breed, the eggs fall through holes of the insert and into the reservoir, thus preventing them from being cannibalized. Because fish in these spawning tanks are not fed and do not get fresh water, they are bred only once a week. During a period where we had high demand for embryos, we instead tried breeding the fish for multiple consecutive days on the recirculating system. Fish were placed into the spawning insert as usual, but the insert was placed into the home tank instead of into the bottom reservoir. We {{found that there was}} no significant difference in the number of fertilized eggs produced between the <b>spawning</b> <b>tank</b> and home tank breeding methods. Further, the fish in the home tanks regularly produced fertile embryos over a 28 -day time course, with the highest number of eggs per pair produced by the tank with only one pair of adult fish. This method is time-saving as fish bred in home tanks only require to be set up once. It is also an effective way to collect embryos over long periods from the same pair or group of fish and to more easily obtain embryos from stocks with low spawning frequency. Chapter 3 The neural tube is the precursor to the brain and spinal cord. Failure of neural tube closure in humans is one of the most common causes of birth defects. Zebrafish with a decrease in Nodal signaling have a phenotype that is analogous to the fatal human birth defect anencephaly, which is caused by an open anterior neural tube. Previous work in our laboratory has found that Nodal signaling acts through the induction of the head mesendoderm and anterior mesoderm, which underlie the anterior neural tube. Using a pharmacological approach, we determined that Nodal signaling is required up to the late blastula stage of 4. 3 hpf for a closed neural tube. This falls within the developmental period when Nodal signaling is most active in mesendoderm and mesoderm induction, supporting the model that Nodal acts through the induction of these tissues. We also found there was a strong correlation between the presence of multiple anterior mesendodermal and mesoderm tissues and neural tube closure. However, no individual tissue was required for neural tube closure. Our finding identifies a specific time window of when Nodal is required for the process of neurulation. This time occurs before the neuroectoderm starts to form, suggesting that Nodal and anterior mesendoderm/mesoderm act very early in the process of neurulation. Further, the finding that multiple mesendodermal/mesodermal tissues are involved suggests that wide region of tissue helps promote closure of the adjacent neural tube...|$|E
40|$|Spawning {{and parental}} {{care in the}} pink variety of Cichlasoma nigrofasciatum (Gunther) was studied from September 1970 to May 1971. The {{objectives}} {{of the study were}} to determine: (1) the spawning behavior of C. nigrofasciatum when isolated as pairs; (2) the spawning behavior of a pair when sharing an aquarium with other cichlid species. The study was conducted in two parts. In Part 1 three aquaria were set up, each containing a pair of sexually mature pink convicts. Twelve different pairs were observed over a period of 120 days. Pre-spawning and post-spawning activities were noted. These were recorded in a pictograph form developed by the author. Eight of these activities were observed in the pre-spawning period and 46 were observed during the days following spawning. The interactions between the members of any one pair differed very little from the interactions of any other pair. One spawning was observed from start to finish and every egg placement was recorded. The eggs appeared to be deposited in an irregular pattern, but form a relatively compact mass when the spawning is completed. When a pair is isolated the female cares for both the eggs and the wigglers. The male takes {{an active role in the}} care of the fry when they are just starting to swim. The male becomes the more ardent parent once the fry are free swimming and spends much of his time keeping the female in close proximity to the young. In Part 2 the presence of other fishes in the aquarium changed the male's behavior appreciably. He became much more involved in the early post-spawning stages, actively involved in the defense of the eggs and wigglers. These changes were not limited to the male; the female's behavior also changed. She was a much more conscientious parent in the later stages of fry care. The male spent very little time driving the female toward the fry. Both parents became more attentive in Part 2. Six aquaria were used in Part 2. This section placed the pink convicts in aquaria with six other species. The interspecific activity was the prime observation. All of the species observed acted alike. The spawning of several of the species was observed, as was the activity of caring for the young of a different species. The most notable observation here was the similarity of behavior of the cichlids representing three different genera. In both parts all pairs spawned in or on a flowerpot provided. The egg and fry care was almost the same for all of the fishes. The interspecific interactions were as intense as most of the intraspecific. The level of intensity observed declined in the following order: (1) same sex same species; (2) same sex related species; (3) different sex same species; and (4) different sex different species. All of the species in Part 2 that spawned used the same behavioral displays used by the convicts in Part 1. All display with lateral weaving, erected fins, flared opercula, and lowered branchiostegals. All of the spawning pairs attempted to occupy a large territory, but none insisted on more than 5 t of their <b>spawning</b> <b>tank.</b> Generally the pairs observed in this study established pair bonds and spawned within two weeks of their introduction to the aquarium. The pink convict lends itself well to this kind of behavioral study because it is a hardy, easy to spawn species large enough to observe easily. They tolerate laboratory conditions very well. The pink variety of C. nigrofasciatum is much less aggressive and more attractive than the native variety. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{greatest}} costs associated with yellow perch aquaculture {{is the price of}} feed-trained fingerlings. Four to six fingerlings may be necessary to produce one pound of marketable perch because of their relatively small size at maturity. This can represent 30 - 50 % of all operating costs if producers choose to purchase feed-trained fingerlings from other growers (Malison 1999). Grow-out producers who wish to produce their own feed-trained fingerlings may choose from several methods that have been investigated and developed (Malison 1999). These methods range from collection of egg ribbons (masses) from the wild and incubation in nursery ponds, to induced spawning of broodstock using hormone injections (Kayes 1977; Dabrowski et al. 1994).

40|$|Pseudoloma neurophilia (Microsporidia) is {{the most}} com-mon {{pathogen}} detected in zebrafi sh (Danio rerio) from re-search facilities. The parasite infects {{the central nervous system}} and muscle and may be associated with emaciation and skeletal deformities. However, many fi sh exhibit sub-clinical infections. Another microsporidium, Pleistophora hyphessobryconis, has recently been detected in a few zebrafi sh facilities. Here, we review the methods for diagnosis and detection, modes of transmission, and approaches used to control microsporidia in zebrafi sh, focusing on P. neuro-philia. The parasite can be readily transmitted by feeding spores or infected tissues, and we show that cohabitation with infected fi sh is also an effective means of transmission. Spores are released from live fi sh in various manners, in-cluding through the urine, feces, and sex products during spawning. Indeed, P. neurophilia infects both the eggs and ovarian tissues, where we found concentrations ranging from 12, 000 to 88, 000 spores per ovary. Hence, various lines of evidence support the conclusion that maternal transmis-sion is a route of infection: spores are numerous in ovaries and developing follicles in infected females, spores are pres-ent in spawned eggs and water from <b>spawning</b> <b>tanks</b> based on polymerase chain reaction tests, and larvae are very sus-ceptible to the infection. Furthermore, egg surface disinfec-tants presently used in zebrafi sh laboratories are ineffective against microsporidian spores.

40|$|Endocrine disrupting {{compounds}} (EDCs) {{are present}} in the environment and can have negative effects on the health of wildlife. Aquatic organisms residing near the outfalls of municipal wastewater effluent (MWWE) are chronically exposed to EDCs, including natural hormones, pharmaceuticals, and industrial chemicals. The vulnerability of aquatic organisms to these compounds is due to the evolutionary conservation of endocrine systems. Although numerous studies have indicated that compounds in MWWE including estrogenic and anti-androgenic contaminants, feminize male fish, it is still uncertain what the consequences of feminization of male fish are. Research on this topic since the early 1990 ’s has demonstrated that a multitude of compounds in MWWE are capable of binding to estrogen receptors in fish. Key biomarkers of estrogen exposure are the elevation of vitellogenin protein and gene expression levels, as well as the presence of female tissue in male gonads; a condition referred to as intersex. The feminization of male fish and intersex condition has been noted in populations of fish around the world including rainbow darter (Etheostoma caeruleum) in the Grand River, Ontario, Canada. Male rainbow darter collected from sites near MWWE outfalls have intersex condition as well as impaired androgen production and sperm development. The aim of the studies in this thesis was to assess the implications of feminized males using rainbow darter as a model. Several questions were addressed through field and laboratory studies. The first question addressed was whether exposure to MWWE, and intersex in particular, reduced the reproductive success of rainbow darter. To test this, fish were collected in the field during the spawning season, gametes were stripped, and manual fertilizations conducted at each of several sites. Fertilization success and embryo survival were lower at sites downstream of a MWWTP outfall when compared to a rural reference site. Additionally, when grouped into categories based on the severity of intersex (based on number and development of oocytes in testes), {{it was found that the}} most severely affected males had the lowest fertilization success. In contrast, no relationship was found between embryo survival and intersex severity, suggesting that egg quality may play a larger role in the survival of embryos. This study concluded that severe intersex condition, which is a marker of MWWE exposure, was an indicator of poor reproductive success in male rainbow darter. The second question addressed in this thesis was whether reproductive behaviour was altered in fish exposed to MWWE. To test this, rainbow darter were collected from sites in the Grand River along an urban gradient and two separate experiments conducted. The first experiment was a breeding competition experiment where three males, each from a different site, were placed into a <b>spawning</b> <b>tank</b> with a single female from either a reference or MWWE exposed site. Reproductive behaviour of both male and female rainbow darter collected near MWWTP outfalls were impaired. Males spent less time guarding the spawning area and females performed fewer nose digs. Both behaviours are important for reproductive success. The second experiment in this study assessed the response of males to a mirror-competitor. Males with severe intersex condition spent less time performing aggressive acts than males with no intersex condition. From these findings, this study concluded that MWWE exposure, as indicated by intersex severity in the second experiment, alters reproductive behaviour of rainbow darter and would likely lead to reduced reproductive fitness in the wild. The third study in this thesis tested whether observations of impaired reproductive success and behaviour are directly associated with MWWE as opposed to other urban stressors. In this study, male and female rainbow darter were collected from a reference site during the pre-spawning period and placed in breeding groups. Following a 10 -day pre-exposure spawning period, rainbow darter breeding groups were exposed to 1 of 5 treatments (control, 17 α-ethinylestradiol (EE 2, a synthetic estrogen), 1 %, 10 %, or 20 % MWWE) for 21 days. After the 21 -day exposure, male behaviour was assessed in a mirror-competitor test. Fecundity (number of eggs) was lower in the highest (20 %) dose of MWWE during the first week of the exposure but was comparable to other groups for the remainder of the experiment. Fertilization success was also lower during the exposure period compared to the pre-exposure period in MWWE exposed and EE 2 exposed fish. Males exposed to 20 % MWWE were less aggressive and more active than the control group. Although the responses of this experiment were less dynamic than those observed in fish exposed in the wild, they corroborated the findings that rainbow darter exposed to MWWE have reduced reproductive fitness. The final study in this thesis addressed the issue of repeatability of field studies of feminized males by comparing the variability of biological measures between fall and spring seasons among five years of collections as well as across levels of biological organization. Measures were most consistent in males collected during the fall. Additionally, measures at the tissue level, including sperm development and intersex incidence and severity, were the most consistent measures among years and seasons. This study concluded that the use of multiple biological measures from several levels of biological organization allowed for the same conclusion to be made about the reproductive health of rainbow darter in all years and both seasons of field collections. Throughout these studies, intersex was found to be one of the most reliable markers of exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds in municipal wastewater effluent. Additionally, from the sum of these studies, it can be concluded that highly prevalent and severe intersex in a population of fish indicates poor reproductive fitness. Whether this results in reduced population size or decreased genetic diversity is not known and is an important topic for future studies...|$|E
40|$|Extended {{abstract}} only. The first spawnings {{were obtained}} 12 days after ablation with 4 spawners yielding 784, 000 eggs and a harvest of 250, 000 P 10 fry. Survival of females after 1 month was approximately 30 %. Mortalities were mostly due to handling stress {{during the regular}} ovarian samplings as well as disease from the accumulated excess feeds {{on the bottom of}} the tank. Male survival could not be recorded because of transfers to other tanks and addition of new stocks. Development seemed to peak 3 weeks after ablation. The average number of eggs per ablated spawner was 120, 000. However, many of the partially spawned females were removed from the <b>spawning</b> <b>tanks</b> the following day so that remaining eggs released in the next 2 to 3 days could not be recorded. Estimate of the average number of eggs per ablated spawner is 120, 000 - 150, 000 in contrast to 500, 000 per wild spawner. However, the low production cost more than compensates for the difference. Fry reared in the Wet Laboratory were used for experiments, mostly on feeding. Therefore, survival at harvest is not to be taken as a reflection of stock quality. Although fewer in number, larvae from ablated prawns are as healthy in terms of vigor in swimming and feeding as those from wild females. Most mortalities are due to inability to molt caused by lower water temperatures and inadequate feeding...|$|R

In all groups males were less than 10  %. The exact number of males and the effective breeding numbers are not available.

Moreover, hatchery managers avoid disturbing the broodfish with manual handling (i.e., stripping) in <b>spawning</b> <b>tanks</b> {{in order to reduce}} the stress levels. The eggs in all groups used in the current experiment were produced in a 7 – 10  day period (from 4 to 15 of May 2009), under increasing artificial photoperiodic regime, which is suitable for spawning synchronization. The protocol was LD 10 : 14 during the middle of the spawning period (May), starting from LD 8.5 : 15.5 at the beginning (15 th of March) to LD 12 : 12 close to the end (30 th of June). Hatching took place more or less simultaneously. The typical broodstock selection process was based on growth rate and the desired phenotype (i.e., body shape). The first selection stage was performed during the pre-ongrowing phase, where the 2  % of the fastest growing fry was transferred to floating cages in the sea. Then, at a body weight > 800  g, the best 500 fish were transferred to the hatchery in quarantine and finally the best 50 broodfish were selected at most to become the broodstock group.|$|R

It {{lives in}} the waters of underground caves in northern Mexico. In the conditions of complete darkness there, the cave tetra has gradually lost the need for eyes and colouring. The females are larger than the males and have a bulkier abdominal section. They are omnivorous, feeding on animal and plant matter. The aim of this research was to determine the influence of basic types of lighting system on the spawning and rearing of Anoptichthys jordani. The findings reveal that alternating light and dark are best used for successful spawning and rearing of this species. The ideal temperature for Anoptichthys jordani ranged from 23 - 24 °C for breeding and from 25 - 26 °C for spawning, with pH levels of 7 - 8 and a specific electrical conductivity of approx. 230 ?S/cm, and with dissolved oxygen levels in the water of approx. 8. 00 mg/L.
