The films producers decided Robinson would be well-suited for the project because {{of his ability to}} capture the music-driven aspects of the film, as provided by his experience in the field. They also cited his talent in storytelling. According to producer Austin, [...] "a lot of music video directors can't capture the story, so what we'd do was turn on the directors' tapes, turn down the music and just watch to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> find the story. Chris was far and away the best." [...] About making ATL his first feature, Robinson stated that [...] "as a music video director, I'd get a lot of scripts {{that had to do with}} really big visual pictures. But I wanted to start off doing something that had heart." [...] After being hired, Robinson traveled to Atlanta and spent time with Austin to try to soak up the vibe and energy of the unique city.|$|E

[...] In an interview with Cameron Crowe, Frey said that he and Henley wanted the song [...] "to open like an episode of the Twilight Zone", and added: [...] "We take this guy and make him like a character in The Magus, where every time he walks through a door there’s a new version of reality. We wanted to write a song just like it was a movie." [...] Frey described the song in an interview with NBC's Bob Costas as a cinematic montage [...] "just one shot to the next ... a picture of a guy on the highway, a picture of the hotel, the guy walks in, the door opens, strange people." [...] Frey continued: [...] "We decided to create something strange, just to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> do it." [...] Henley then wrote most of the lyrics based on Frey's idea, and sought inspiration for the writing by driving out into the desert as well as from films and theater.|$|E

With the commercial success of punk and alternative rock bands in the early 1990s, All began considering offers from major labels.

We had done this slow building up to where as many as a thousand people might be coming to see us in some places, which for us was a huge deal, so we thought we'd try to <b>see</b> <b>if</b> maybe <b>we</b> <b>could</b> get the records out to more people." [...] "In {{the past year or so}} we've seen bands like Green Day and Season to Risk turning up at the Walmart in Brookfield, Missouri", [...] remarked bassist Karl Alvarez. [...] "We really like the idea of getting our records in places where people go who aren't hip to the mom-and-pop record stores that traditionally carry the independents. People forget that punk rock was on the majors early on with bands like Iggy and the Ramones. The fact that the major labels ignored the real groundbreaking rock of the '80s gave everyone a real bad feeling about the majors, but as it stands now, they are starting to get a little hipper." ...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{instructive}} {{to consider the}} use of bar scales that might appear on a printed version of this projection. The scale is true (k=1) on the equator so that multiplying its length on a printed map by the inverse of the RF (or principal scale) gives the actual circumference of the Earth. The bar scale on the map is also drawn at the true scale so that transferring a separation between two points on the equator to the bar scale will give the correct distance between those points. The same is true on the meridians. On a parallel other than the equator the scale is [...] so when we transfer a separation from a parallel to the bar scale we must divide the bar scale distance by this factor to obtain {{the distance between the}} points when measured along the parallel (which is not the true distance along a great circle). On a line at a bearing of say 45 degrees (...) the scale is continuously varying with latitude and transferring a separation along the line to the bar scale does not give a distance related to the true distance in any simple way. (But <b>see</b> addendum). Even <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> work out a distance along this line of constant bearing its relevance is questionable since such a line on the projection corresponds to a complicated curve on the sphere. For these reasons bar scales on small-scale maps must be used with extreme caution.|$|R

In 1890, some time after Wounded Knee, Luther moved from Rosebud and followed his father and brother Ellis Standing Bear to Pine Ridge, South Dakota. [...] Pine Ridge provided a series of varying employment and family ventures. In 1891, Luther became principal of a reservation day school. Standing Bear also worked in his uncle’s little general store. [...] One day {{they were talking about}} the delay in mail delivery. [...] “I told my uncle that John Wanamaker, the man for whom I had worked in Philadelphia, was Postmaster-General, and that I would write and <b>see</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> not have a post office established at his camp. [...] I suggested that we call it Kyle. [...] It was a short name and easy to spell. [...] When Mr. Wanamaker received my letter, he replied immediately. [...] He was pleased with my suggestion, but said that he could not appoint me postmaster, as I was an Indian. [...] It would have to be some white man. [...] There was a Joseph Taylor who was one of our missionaries, and we sent his name. [...] He received the appointment, but I took care of the office.” [...] Later, Luther opened a dry goods store with his brother Ellis at Pass Creek and started a small ranch raising horses and cattle. Standing Bear organized public meetings at his dry goods store in Pine Ridge to discuss treaties and current events.|$|E

40|$|Background: Penile {{cancer is}} a rare but {{destructive}} malignancy. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify published qualitative research exploring patients' experiences of being diagnosed and treated for penile cancer. As only one study met our inclusion criteria and yet there were five borderline studies, a secondary aim that emerged was to discuss those studies to <b>see</b> what, <b>if</b> anything, <b>we</b> <b>could</b> learn. Methods: <b>We</b> searched ASSIA, CINAHL, EMBASE, PUBMED/MEDLINE, PsycINFO & Web of Science and found 313 papers published since 1990. Two reviewers independently selected 17 papers for potential inclusion using titles and abstracts, which were obtained and independently assessed. A synthesis was not possible as only one study met our inclusion criteria. Five borderline studies, covering 4 countries, invited closer inspection because they are often reported in guidelines on penile cancer. Results: The 5 borderline studies reported using a mixed methods design combining a psychometric measure with interviews. Unfortunately, none of these studies reported the method or process used for analysing qualitative data or for integrating the interview and psychometric findings, making it difficult to understand the interview element of their research. Conclusions: <b>If</b> <b>we</b> are to understand and improve the long-term consequences of treatment for penile cancer, qualitative studies of patients? experiences need to be conducted with high quality analysis and reporting. While pen-and-paper questionnaires may take up little of the time of clinicians conducting research about rare conditions, time could be better used by using methodologies that explore patients experiences. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Earth’s {{sea floor}} is created along great {{volcanic}} ridges that spread at rates {{of a few}} centimeters per year beneath every ocean basin. The volcanic and tectonic processes at these mid-ocean ridges ultimately determine {{the characteristics of the}} sea floor and the oceanic crust beneath it. These processes occur beneath several kilometers of rock and seawater, seemingly far removed from climatic variations above sea level. Thus, it is surprising that both Crowley et al. (1), in this week’s Science Express, and Tolstoy (2) found ice age periodicity in hilly topography on the flanks of ridges submerged beneath the Southern and Pacific Oceans. After its creation at the mid-ocean ridges, Earth’s sea floor forms the abyssal hills (<b>see</b> the figure). <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> view this terrain without its cover of water, it would appear as gentle rolling hills hundreds of meters high and spaced kilometers apart. The abyssal hills are oriented roughly par-allel to the ridges where they are formed and are carried across the ocean basins by seafloor spreading. Over the course of tens of millions of years, the abyssal hills become buried by sediments, but they are nevertheless observable in bathymetric surveys across vast expanses of sea floor (3). This coverage makes the abyssal hills the most extensive geological feature on Earth, but their remoteness means that they remain largely unexplored and poorly un-derstood. Detailed bathymetric surveys, obtained using so-nar that images a swath of sea floor beneath a ship, have only been obtained for {{a small portion of the}} sea floor. Close examination of these images informs our understanding of how the abyssal hills are created. In particular, extensional faults associated with mid-ocean ridge rifting are thought to be important (4). Such faults are observable in bathymetric surveys of newly created abyssal hills near ridge crests and are prevalent in computer models of rifting (5). Comprehensive bathymetry of the Australian-Antarctic ridge south of Tasmania, observed from a South Korean ice-breaker, allowed Crowley et al. to examine an unusually long record of abyssal hill fabric. They found that the abys-sal hills exhibit characteristic spacing of about 23, 000, 41, 000, and 100, 000 years. Working separately but concur-rently, Tolstoy also detected 100, 000 -year periodicity in the abyssal hill fabric of the East Pacific Rise, a ridge west o...|$|R
