5|$|By {{this point}} in his life Beebe was {{developing}} a close friendship with the American romance novelist Elswyth Thane, who had met Beebe in 1925. Very little of their early correspondence survives, but Elswyth had idolized Beebe for years, and her first novel Riders of the Wind was devoted to him. The novel was an account of a young woman who falls in love with, and eventually marries, a much older adventurer who strongly resembled Beebe. Beebe and Elswyth were married on September 22, 1927, when Beebe was 50. Due to Elswyth's tendency to misrepresent her age, conflicting accounts exist of how old <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> she and Beebe were married, ranging from 23 to 28. Elswyth and Beebe had an open marriage, in which neither expected sexual exclusivity from the other so long as their life together was not damaged.|$|E

Commandant Teste remained in North African waters until December 1939, {{when she returned}} to Toulon and landed her aircraft. She served as an aircraft transport between French North Africa and Metropolitan France {{for the first half of}} 1940. In late June 1940, she was transferred from the over-crowded anchorage at Oran to Mers El Kébir. She was lightly damaged by shell splinters during the British attack on Mers-el-Kébir on 3 July 1940, but suffered no casualties. She arrived at Toulon on 18 October where she was subsequently disarmed. In June 1941, Commandant Teste was reactivated as a gunnery training ship.|$|E

Kirk sends the dazed Darnell outside; when Nancy goes out to fetch her husband, she beckons Darnell to follow her.|$|E

25|$|The Bhagavata Purana narrates: Once, {{an adult}} Krishna visited his cousins – the five Pandava {{brothers}} with their common wife Draupadi {{and their mother}} Kunti in their capital Indraprastha (modern-day Delhi), located {{on the banks of}} the Yamuna. The eldest Pandava Yudhishthira requests Krishna to stay with them for a couple of days. One day, Krishna and the middle Pandava Arjuna go for hunting in the forest. During their hunting, Arjuna was tired. He and Krishna went to the Yamuna and bathed and drank the clear water. There, a lovely girl was strolling along the river bank. Krishna who saw her and asked Arjuna to meet her to know who <b>she</b> <b>was.</b> <b>When</b> Arjuna inquired, the girl told him that she was Kalindi, the daughter of Surya, and that she was living in a house constructed by her father in the river where she has been was performing austerities with intent to have Vishnu as her husband and would remain there, until she finds him. Arjuna conveys Kalindi's message to Krishna, the avatar of Vishnu, who readily agreed to marry the beautiful damsel. Then they traveled to Indraprastha with Kalindi in the chariot and met Yudhishthira. After a stay of few days there, Krishna and Kalindi returned to his capital Dwarka with their entourage and duly married each other. According to Bhagavata Purana she had ten sons: Shruta, Kavi, Vrsa, Vira, Subahu, Bhadra, Santi, Darsa, Purnamasa and the youngest, Somaka. The Vishnu Purana mentions that she had many sons headed by Shruta.|$|E

Originally, [...] "7 Things" [...] was more [...] "soft and nice" [...] but Cyrus says she [...] "went nuts" [...] during the recording process and gave the song a harder sound. Cyrus had initially chosen [...] "Fly on the Wall" [...] as the lead single from Breakout, but replaced it with [...] "7 Things" [...] because she felt it was a [...] "better introduction" [...] to the album.|$|E

On the 1990 Rhythm Nation 1814 Tour, {{it was the third}} song on the setlist. She performed the song with fellow dancers Tina Landon and Karen Owens, and was followed by a performance of [...] "Let's Wait Awhile".

Her confusion represents her lack of self-confidence, her fear that she still does not fit in or have a place in the world, unlike those around her, who are competent and know what is going on. She wears ordinary clothes, but the others repeatedly comment on the excellence of her [...] "costume", a reference to her fear that her friends do not see what she has grown into, but rather what <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> younger: nerdy and awkward. This fear is confirmed when Buffy strips off her shirt and jeans, revealing the same unfashionable turtleneck and corduroy jumper she wore in episode one of the series, four years earlier, before her demon-fighting experiences and study of magic increased her confidence and competence.

500|$|Since {{her debut}} in DC Comics publication, and fueled by her {{adaptation}} into the Batman television series in 1967, Barbara Gordon has been listed among fictional characters that {{are regarded as}} cultural icons. Author Brian Cronin, in Was Superman A Spy?: And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed (2009) notes that following her 1967 debut, [...] "Batgirl was soon popular enough to appear regularly {{over the next two}} decades and Yvonne Craig certainly made an impression on many viewers with her one season portraying young Ms. Gordon." [...] Similarly, Cronin states that following the publication of The Killing Joke, Barbara Gordon—in her new persona as Oracle—became [...] "more popular, in fact, than <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> she was Batgirl. She even gained her own title, Birds of Prey, about her and a group of superhero operatives she organizes" [...] The character has been the subject of analysis in academia, regarding the portrayal of women, librarians, and disabled people in mainstream media. Throughout the course of the character's history, Barbara Gordon's intelligence has been one of her defining attributes. According to BusinessWeek, she is listed as one of the top ten most intelligent fictional superheroes appearing in American comics, and is the only female character to appear on the list. In 2011, IGN ranked Barbara Gordon 17th in the Top 100 Comic Books Heroes.|$|E

500|$|Zenna, Chancer and Kyte were {{occasional}} {{targets of}} professional jealousy from their human co-stars, and some television critics {{have suggested that}} Wellard was a better character than his owner, Robbie. When Michael Greco commented in 2002 that Wellard received better scripts than his character, Beppe di Marco, the Sunday Mirror Ian Hyland wrote: [...] "He should try being Robbie Jackson. Wellard gets better scripts and better girls than him." [...] Similarly, Garry Bushell of The People compared EastEnders with rival soap Coronation Street following a 2003 scheduling clash, observing: [...] "ITV had Richard Hillman's heavyweight murder confession. BBC1 gave us Robbie Jackson's heart-to-heart with Wellard. (Don't scoff– it's tough to play moving scenes with a dumb and soppy creature, but Wellard rose to the occasion.)". Derek McGovern of The Mirror criticised Gaffney's acting ability, observing: [...] "Outside of Lassie movies I haven't seen a dog consistently steal scenes off a human the way Wellard used to pinch them from Dean." [...] Gemma Bissix appeared in the show as a child actor from 1993 to 1998, playing Clare Bates. She commented on her return in 2008 that as a child, the dogs playing Wellard were better paid than <b>she</b> <b>was.</b> <b>When</b> Emma Barton, who played Honey Mitchell, was axed from the soap later that year, she spoke of her dismay that Wellard's death was being marketed as a bigger storyline than her character's exit. Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury called it [...] "particularly galling" [...] that Barton's exit was upstaged by Wellard's death.|$|E
500|$|Children of Earth {{director}} Euros Lyn {{remarks that}} by the third series Gwen has grown so that [...] "she now is {{on a par with}} Jack, in terms of having the knowledge and the experience to make decisions and to be a heroine".

Myles states that Gwen becomes a harsher character, but she feels that, [...] "if she wasn't, people would die". David Cornelius observes that Gwen is no longer the kind-hearted outsider <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> she first joined Torchwood. By Children of Earth she has become [...] "colder and much more aggressive". Her horrific experiences turn her into [...] "a biting cynic"; when both government and army betray the British people, Gwen claims to understand finally why the Doctor does not save humanity from world crises. She believes he [...] "must look at this planet and turn away in shame". A press release stated that Miracle Day had Gwen [...] "make the most terrible decisions, on behalf of all mankind". This is evident in [...] "The Blood Line", where her character is shown to be willing to sacrifice the entire Torchwood team, in addition to her dying father, {{for the good of the}} world. Commenting on Gwen's characterisation in this episode, Dan Martin notes that [...] "Gwen sees transition into the Earth Mothering Tank Girl become complete, as she plays God and appears to love it." ...|$|E

[...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters compared [...] "Don't Let Me Stop You" [...] (2009) with [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] saying that the former [...] "may sound like another rewrite of an older Clarkson hit (in this case, [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes"), but the observational lyrics about a questionable relationship are what ultimately makes the whole thing click." [...] Charles Merwin of Stylus Magazine felt that the song should sell records more because [...] "the entire musical backing drops out to let Clarkson’s voice through to live or die on its own." [...] Pam Avoledo of Blogcritics believed that [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] was superior to the writing of [...] "Since U Been Gone", commenting that [...] "It's punchier, well-written and gives Clarkson a chance to show off her vocal skills without the trendy haughtiness." [...] Joe Cross of Cox Communications thought that [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] was a decent follow-up to [...] "Since U Been Gone", saying [...] "It's no [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] which is just a pop-rock juggernaut, but as follow-ups go, it's not too shabby. Clarkson's down-home everything (well, mostly her looks) sells these little heartbreak haikus exceptionally well." [...] He also listed [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes" [...] as one of the 40 songs that defined the summer of 2005. The same sentiment was echoed by Robert Copsey of Digital Spy who considered the song as Clarkson's second best single after [...] "Since U Been Gone", writing [...] "It proved a slow burner at the time of release, but this track's greatness continues to be realised over time." ...|$|E
