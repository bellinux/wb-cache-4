In the workflow of Blue Wool test one reference stripe set shall be stored protected from any exposure of light.

For example, if the lightfastness of the colourant is indicated to be 5 on Blue Wool scale, it {{can be expected to}} fade similar amount as the <b>strip</b> <b>number</b> 5 in Blue Wool test strip set.

5000|$|The {{ultraviolet}} (UV) radiation {{in light}} {{is responsible for}} ink fading. As the intensity of UV radiation differs from place to place, the ink fading also depends on place. It will be more in areas with more UV radiation and vice versa. This difficulty is overcome by the bluewool testing method. Absolute values of fading will depend on light intensity. Relative values of fading, comparing the sample with the standard blue test strip, will depend less on intensity. For example, if a pigment is rated as [...] "BW5" [...] it {{can be expected to}} fade to the same degree as <b>strip</b> <b>number</b> 5 on a bluewool test card, for any specific light exposure. The method of comparison between the sample and a test strip enables accelerated testing to be carried out under intense artificial illumination.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} {{quantitative}} electrostatic {{theory of the}} gate-induced confinement of two-dimensional electron gas (2 DEG) in the quantum Hall regime. The self-consistent electrostatic potential in the region occupied by 2 DEG changes in a steplike manner due {{to the formation of}} alternating strips of compressible and incompressible electron liquids. We obtain the dependence of positions and widths of these strips on the filling factor. Incompressible strips are shown to be much more narrow than the compressible ones. The relationship between the widths of the adjacent compressible and incompressible strips is found to be universal: It does not depend on the <b>strip</b> <b>number,</b> magnetic field, or gate voltage.

The level of morphological diversity present in this group provides an excellent system for demonstrating evolutionary transformations in morphological characters. This diversity also provides compelling evidence for major events in eukaryote evolution, such as the punctuated effects of secondary endosymbiosis and mutations in underlying developmental mechanisms. In this essay, we synthesize evidence for the origin, adaptive significance and diversification of the euglenid cytoskeleton, especially pellicle ultrastructure, pellicle surface patterns, pellicle <b>strip</b> <b>number</b> and the feeding apparatus. We also highlight holes in our knowledge that must be filled before {{we are able to}} confidently describe euglenid cell biology and infer the earliest stages in euglenid evolution.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{majority}} of concrete {{buildings in the}} regions of high seismicity in Iran do not meet seismic code requirement, {{and many of these}} buildings are vulnerable in severe earthquakes. Concerns for seismic strengthening of concrete grew considerably in the recent years, and has been accelerated since the Bam earthquake 2004. This paper presents the results of experimental and analytical study on the application of strapping technique for retrofitting of concrete columns. Experimental program included axial compressive tests on cylindrical and prismatic small-scale columns which were actively confined by pre-stressed metal strips. Test Results showed significant increase in strength and ductility of columns due to active confinement with metal strips. The effect of various parameters such as pretensioning force in the <b>strip,</b> <b>number</b> of strip layers wrapped around the specimens and spacing of confining strips on strength of concrete is studied. Nonlinear Finite element models of tested specimens were also made and analyzed. The observed stress-strain behaviors of columns with different levels of confinement are compared to those obtained from finite element method...|$|E

In this note the detailed design of the FCA* layout is described. 1 Introduction The Technical Proposal for a possible upgrade around the FCA (the FCA*) based on Thin Gap Gas Chambers has been presented to DELPHI and it is described in a separate DELPHI note [1]. In this note the detailed design of the FCA* layout is described. 2 FCA geometry From the references [2, 3, 4] we have the following information. The FCA trigger strip width is h = 3 : 14 cm. There are 64 trigger strips for each coordinate x, u, v, each rotated by 120 ffi {{with respect to the}} others. The external radius of the FCA acceptance is then 32 strips that is 32 h = 100 : 48 cm. The internal radius of the FCA acceptance is about 9 strips that is about 9 h = 28 : 26 cm.

40|$|Stratum corneum from Negroes and Caucasians {{has been}} {{compared}} with respect to facility of tape <b>stripping,</b> <b>numbers</b> of cell layers, and density. Significantly more strips were required for removal of stratum corneum, and significantly more cell layers {{were present in the}} stratum corneum from Negroes as compared to Caucasians. The buoyant density of abdominal stratum corneum, as determined in organic solvent systems, is less in Negroes than in Caucasians. The reverse is true when density in air is determined and when isopyknic sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation is employed. We believe the latter values portray the true relationship of Negro and Caucasian stratum corneum, since detipidization does not occur, and since a greater density of Negro stratum corneum is consonant with its greater microscopic compactness...|$|R

40|$|One {{water and}} three rock samples {{were taken from}} a mined tunnel system, U 12 n, in Rainier Mesa at the Nevada Test Site. Endolithic {{microorganisms}} were cultured from ashfall tuff, which was crushed and made into slurries with a formulation of artificial pore water, on R 2 A agar plates. Microbial counts ranged from 102 to 104 viable cells per g (dry weight) of rock sampled. The cultured water sample yielded 102 viable cells per ml. Many of the isolates were very small (< 1 μm) when viewed in the rock matrix and remained small even when cultured. Most were gram-negative rods. Individual isolates were profiled by API-NFT <b>strip</b> <b>number,</b> antibiotic and metal resistance patterns, and colony and cellular morphologies.

The same genus was identified in three of these cases, but different species were indicated. The genus Pseudomonas was the most commonly identified. The isolate profiles and the three identification systems demonstrated that water isolates were considerably different from endolithic isolates...|$|E
40|$|Uniquely in eukaryotes, euglenoid pellicles {{comprise}} longitudinal proteinaceous, epiplasmic strips underlain by microtubules. Contradictory {{interpretations of}} pellicle microtubule duplication and segregation assumed opposite microtubule polarity from kinetoplastid Euglenozoa and conservative microtubule segregation. Distigma shows new pellicle microtubules nucleating posteriorly as in trypanosomatids, unifying euglenoid and kinetoplastid pellicle morphogenesis, but strip-growth is unpolarised. Epiplasmic insertion and cutting make new strip junctions between alternating wide and narrow daughter strips that grow intussusceptively. Nanotubules, overlooked epiplasm-associated components, define strip edges. At strip heel/toe junctions all euglenoids have a morphogenetic centre microtubule mt 2 / 3 pair. Arguably, proteolysis, epiplasmic growth, and toe-nanotubule-associated epiplasmic scission initiate daughter strips, separating old mts 2 / 3; new mt 2 / 3 /bridge-B assembly, sub-heel scission, nanotubule-bridge-A assembly complete duplication. Only mt 2 / 3 pair fully enters the canal, one master microtubule also the reservoir, other pellicle microtubules terminating near canal rims.

40|$|We study numerically {{the optical}} {{properties}} of the periodic in one dimension flat gratings made of multiple thin silver nanostrips suspended in free space. Unlike other publications, we consider the gratings that are finite however made of many strips that are well thinner than the wavelength. Our analysis {{is based on the}} combined use of two techniques earlier verified by us in the scattering by a single thin strip of conventional dielectric: the generalized (effective) boundary conditions (GBCs) imposed on the strip median lines and the Nystrom-type discretization of the associated singular and hyper-singular integral equations (IEs). The first point means {{that in the case of}} the metal strip thickness being only a small fraction of the free-space wavelength (typically 5 nm to 50 nm versus 300 nm to 1 μm) we can neglect the internal field and consider only the field limit values. In its turn, this enables reduction of the integration contour in the associated IEs to the strip median lines. This brings significant simplification of the scattering analysis while preserving a reasonably adequate modeling. The second point guarantees fast convergence and controlled accuracy of computations that enables us to compute the gratings consisting of hundreds of thin strips, with total size in hundreds of wavelengths. Thanks to this, in the H-polarization case we demonstrate the build-up of sharp grating resonances (a. k. a. as collective or lattice resonances) in the scattering and absorption cross-sections of sparse multi-strip gratings, in addition to better known localized surface-plasmon resonances on each strip. The grating modes, which are responsible for these resonances, have characteristic near-field patterns that are distinctively different from the plasmons as can be seen if the <b>strip</b> <b>number</b> gets larger. In the E-polarization case, no such resonances are detectable however the build-up of Rayleigh anomalies is observed, accompanied by the reduced scattering and absorption...|$|E

The data included gender, age group, month of purchase, sales place, type of <b>strips,</b> <b>number</b> of packages dispensed, and cost of strips. Additionally, statistics on sales of insulin and oral antidiabetes medications were obtained from the Norwegian Prescription Database. Results: A total of 96, 999 persons purchased strips, a prevalence of 2 %. Approximately 70 % of diabetes patients practiced SMBG. An average patient used 1. 7 strips per day, and younger patients purchased more strips than older patients. Fewer than 50 % of patients performed glucose measurements daily. One percent of patients used more than 10 strips daily and was accountable for 8 % of total costs. Most patients used only one type of <b>strips,</b> but the <b>number</b> of <b>strips</b> purchased increased with the <b>number</b> of different <b>strips.</b> The average annual cost of strips was 446 € per person. Conclusions: Two percent of all non-institutionalized inhabitants and an estimated 70 % of patients using diabetes medication purchased SMBG strips.
