During the day three other steamers were sighted, all southbound. The first was the South Australian, and the second was one of the Hawkesbury river boats. Both vessels, however, were too far out to hear voices. A few hours afterwards the City of Grafton passed within 50 yards of Captain Gallant and the cook, but although renewed efforts were made by the now exhausted men to attract attention, the vessel passed by without noticing them.|$|E

[...] "We were all very well so long as we had no rivals--we were better than nothing. But now that you have become the fashion, and have your pick every day of three invitations to dinner, we are tossed into the corner. I am sure it is very good of you to come and see us once a month; I wonder you don't <b>send</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> cards in an envelope. When you do, pray have them with black edges; it will be for the death of my last illusion." [...] It was in this incisive strain that Mrs. Tristram moralized over Newman's so-called neglect, which was in reality a most exemplary constancy. Of course she was joking, but there was always something ironical in her jokes, as there was always something jocular in her gravity.|$|E

"You know, moreover, of what {{consequence}} it is, {{that the}} missioners, who {{are sent to}} the Indies, should be proper for the end proposed; and it is convenient, on that account, that you come to Portugal and Rome: for not only many more will be desirous of going on those missions, but you will make a better choice of missioners, and will see more clearly to what parts such and such are proper to be sent. You judge yourself of what consideration it is, not to be mistaken in these affairs; and whatsoever relation you can <b>send</b> <b>us,</b> <b>your</b> letters are not sufficient {{to give us a}} true notion of what labourers are fitting for the Indies. It is necessary that you, or some one as intelligent as you, should know and practise those who are designed for those countries.

You will also be of no little use to the affairs of Congo and Brasil, on which you can have no influence in India, for want of commerce betwixt them and you.

We spurn from us with disgust and indignation the slanders {{of those who}} bring us their anecdotes with the attestation of the flower-de-luce on their shoulder. We have Lord George Gordon fast in Newgate; and neither his being a public proselyte to Judaism, nor his having, in his zeal against Catholic priests {{and all sorts of}} ecclesiastics, raised a mob (excuse the term, it is still in use here) which pulled down all our prisons, have preserved to him a liberty of which he did not render himself worthy by a virtuous use of it. We have rebuilt Newgate, and tenanted the mansion. We have prisons almost as strong as the Bastile, for those who dare to libel the queens of France. In this spiritual retreat let the noble libeller remain. Let him there meditate on his Talmud, until he learns a conduct more becoming his birth and parts, and not so disgraceful to the ancient religion to which he has become a proselyte,--or until some persons from your side of the water, to please your new Hebrew brethren, shall ransom him. He may then be enabled to purchase, with the old hoards of the synagogue, and a very small poundage on the long compound interest of the thirty pieces of silver, (Dr. Price has shown us what miracles compound interest will perform in 1790 years,) the lands which are lately discovered to have been usurped by the Gallican Church. <b>Send</b> <b>us</b> <b>your</b> Popish Archbishop of Paris, and we will send you our Protestant Rabbin.

40|$|Topological superconductors {{have become}} a subject of intense {{research}} due to their potential use for technical applications in device fabrication and quantum information. Besides fully gapped superconductors, unconventional superconductors with point or line nodes in their order parameter can also exhibit nontrivial topological characteristics. This article reviews recent progress in the theoretical understanding of nodal topological superconductors, {{with a focus on}} Weyl and noncentrosymmetric superconductors and their protected surface states. Using selected examples, we review the bulk topological properties of these systems, study different types of topological surface states, and examine their unusual properties. Furthermore, we survey some candidate materials for topological superconductivity and discuss different experimental signatures of topological surface states.
