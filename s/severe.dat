5|$|A {{major part}} of modern weather {{forecasting}} is the <b>severe</b> weather alerts and advisories that the national weather services issue in the case that <b>severe</b> or hazardous weather is expected. This is done to protect life and property. Some {{of the most commonly}} known of <b>severe</b> weather advisories are the <b>severe</b> thunderstorm and tornado warning, as well as the <b>severe</b> thunderstorm and tornado watch. Other forms of these advisories include winter weather, high wind, flood, tropical cyclone, and fog. <b>Severe</b> weather advisories and alerts are broadcast through the media, including radio, using emergency systems as the Emergency Alert System, which break into regular programming.|$|E

30|$|We {{analyze the}} fixing {{time of the}} <b>severest</b> {{concurrency}} bugs and the <b>severest</b> non-concurrency bugs to investigate how fast the <b>severest</b> bugs get fixed. Based on the severity classification given in Section 3.3, “Blocker” group defined for categorizing the bugs with highest priority, thus we extract the bugs tagged as “Blocker” from our concurrency and non-concurrency bugs’ data sets. We also calculate the fixing time for each bug as explained in Section 3.2. We analyze the fixing time of the bug with “Blocker” severity in order to compare the fixing time for the <b>severest</b> concurrency and non-concurrency bugs.|$|R
5|$|By 7:00a.m. Central Daylight Time, CAPE values began {{exceeding}} 4,000 j/kg, a {{level that}} climatologically favors the development of <b>severe</b> thunderstorms. Despite conflicting model data on the specified area where thunderstorms would develop, the newly available information that denoted a more favorable <b>severe</b> thunderstorm setup {{in that part of}} the state prompted the SPC to upgrade the forecasted threat of <b>severe</b> weather to a moderate risk for south-central Kansas, much of the western two-thirds of Oklahoma, and the northwestern and north-central portions Texas at 11:15a.m. CDT that morning, which now indicated an elevated threat of strong tornadoes.|$|E

5|$|Day 4–8 outlooks are the longest-term {{official}} SPC Forecast Product, {{and often}} change significantly {{from day to}} day. This extended forecast for <b>severe</b> weather was an experimental product until March 22, 2007, when the Storm Prediction Center incorporated it as an official product. Areas are delineated in this forecast that have least a 15% or 30% chance of <b>severe</b> weather in the Day 4–8 period (equivalent to a slight risk and an enhanced risk, respectively); as forecaster confidence is not fully resolute on how <b>severe</b> weather will evolve more than three days out, the Day 4–8 outlook only outlines {{the areas in which}} <b>severe</b> thunderstorms are forecast to occur during the period at the 15% and 30% likelihood, and does not utilize other categorical risk areas or outline where general (non-severe) thunderstorm activity will occur.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1970s, the U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) {{increased}} {{its efforts to}} train storm spotters to spot key features of storms which indicate <b>severe</b> hail, damaging winds, and tornadoes, as well as damage itself and flash flooding. The program was called Skywarn, and the spotters were local sheriff's deputies, state troopers, firefighters, ambulance drivers, amateur radio operators, civil defense (now emergency management) spotters, storm chasers, and ordinary citizens. When <b>severe</b> weather is anticipated, local weather service offices request that these spotters look out for <b>severe</b> weather, and report any tornadoes immediately, so that the office can warn of the hazard.|$|E
5|$|In total, 56 <b>severe</b> weather watches {{were issued}} by the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) over those four days in the {{outbreak}} area, including 41 tornado watches (10 of which were PDS watches) and 15 <b>severe</b> thunderstorm watches.

5|$|Local {{forecast}} {{offices of}} the National Weather Service, radio and television stations, and emergency planners often use the forecasts to gauge the potential <b>severe</b> weather threats to their areas. Even after the marginal and enhanced risk categories were added in October 2014, some television stations have continued to use the original three-category system to outline forecasted <b>severe</b> weather risks (though stations that do this may utilize in-house <b>severe</b> weather outlooks that vary to some degree from the SPC convective outlooks), while certain others that have switched to the current system {{have chosen not to}} outline marginal risk areas.|$|E
5|$|Malaria {{has several}} serious complications. Among {{these is the}} {{development}} of respiratory distress, which occurs in up to 25% of adults and 40% of children with <b>severe</b> P.falciparum malaria. Possible causes include respiratory compensation of metabolic acidosis, noncardiogenic pulmonary oedema, concomitant pneumonia, and <b>severe</b> anaemia. Although rare in young children with <b>severe</b> malaria, acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs in 5–25% of adults and up to 29% of pregnant women. Coinfection of HIV with malaria increases mortality. Renal failure is a feature of blackwater fever, where hemoglobin from lysed red blood cells leaks into the urine.|$|E
5|$|Mesoscale {{discussions are}} issued to provide {{information}} on certain individual regions where <b>severe</b> weather is becoming a threat and states whether a watch is likely and details thereof, particularly concerning conditions conducive {{for the development of}} <b>severe</b> thunderstorms in the short term, as well as situations of isolated <b>severe</b> weather when watches are not necessary. Watches are issued when forecasters are confident that <b>severe</b> weather will occur, and usually precede the onset of <b>severe</b> weather by one hour, although this sometimes varies depending on certain atmospheric conditions that may inhibit or accelerate convective development.|$|E
