5|$|Darwin {{observed}} that the males of some <b>species,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> birds of paradise, were {{very different from the}} females.|$|E
5|$|In some <b>species,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Heliconius charithonia, mating {{can occur}} inside the pupa of females by males.|$|E
5|$|Mimicry {{may involve}} {{numerous}} species; many harmless <b>species</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> hoverflies are Batesian mimics of strongly defended <b>species</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> wasps, while many such well-defended species form Mullerian mimicry rings, all resembling each other. Mimicry between prey species and their predators often involves {{three or more}} species.|$|E

5|$|Omnivorous mammals such as {{the raccoon}} and skunk and {{herbivore}} mammal <b>species</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the porcupine and pika, are common to the forest. The beaver is considered a species of special interest to Shoshone National Forest since its dam building activities improve habitat for numerous other <b>species</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the moose, breeding waterfowl, various amphibians and other species dependent on a riparian environment.|$|E
5|$|Species are {{generally}} diploid with 2n=22 chromosomes, but some <b>species,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Hippeastrum iguazuanum, have 24.|$|E
5|$|The {{bottlenose}} dolphin sometimes forms mixed species groups with other species from the dolphin family, particularly larger <b>species,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the short-finned pilot whale, the {{false killer whale}} and Risso's dolphin. They also interact with smaller <b>species,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the Atlantic spotted dolphin and the rough-toothed dolphin. While interactions with smaller species are sometimes affiliative, {{they can also be}} hostile.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>species</b> are ovoviviparous, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> pseudomorphine carabids.|$|R
5000|$|This {{marine species}} has only ever {{occurred}} within European waters (European Register of Marine <b>Species</b> scope) <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the Bay of Biscay, Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea.|$|R
2500|$|True IMTA can be land-based, using ponds or tanks, or even open-water marine or {{freshwater}} systems. Implementations {{have included}} <b>species</b> combinations <b>such</b> <b>as</b> shellfish/shrimp, fish/seaweed/shellfish, fish/seaweed, fish/shrimp and seaweed/shrimp.|$|R
5|$|While the {{perianth}} may point forwards, in some <b>species</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> N. cyclamineus it {{is folded}} back (reflexed, see illustration, left), while {{in some other}} <b>species</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> N. bulbocodium (Table I), it is reduced to a few barely visible pointed segments with a prominent corona.|$|E
5|$|Allogamy (outcrossing) on {{the whole}} is {{enforced}} through a late-acting (ovarian) self-incompatibility system, but some <b>species</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> N. dubius and N. longispathus are self-compatible producing mixtures of selfed and outcrossed seeds.|$|E
5|$|Although a large {{majority}} of bumblebees follow such monogynous colony cycles that only involve one queen, some select Bombus <b>species</b> (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> Bombus atratus) will spend part of their life cycle in a polygynous phase (have multiple queens in one nest during these periods of polygyny).|$|E
50|$|It {{is closely}} related to C. cunninghamiana. Hybrids with C. cunninghamiana subsp. cunninghamiana have been {{recorded}} where the two <b>species</b> co-occur, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> at Lower Portland and Wisemans Ferry.|$|R
50|$|Other <b>species</b> epithets, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Enicurus scouleri and Hypericum scouleri commemorate his name. Scouler made large {{collections}} of specimens {{in the western}} regions of North America and the Galapagos.|$|R

5|$|Although many Lilium <b>species</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Lilium martagon and Lilium candidum can be {{obtained}} commercially, the majority of commercially available lilies represent the products of a very diverse hybridisation program, which {{has resulted in a}} separate horticultural classification, including such groupings as Asian, Oriental and Orienpet. In addition to a very wide variety of heights, lilies can {{be obtained}} in many colours and combinations of colours, and if properly selected can produce an extensive blooming season from early summer to autumn. Because of the history of Liliaceae, many <b>species</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Watsonia (bugle lily) that were previously classified in this family bear the name 'lily' but are neither part of the genus Lilium, or the Liliaceae family.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{majority}} of the forest areas around Pichilemu are covered with pine and eucalyptus plantations, a native forest (now the Municipal Forest) remains. It contains <b>species</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Litres, Quillayes, Boldos, Espinos, and Peumos.|$|E
5|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to {{introduce}} H.gammarus to New Zealand, alongside other European <b>species</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> the edible crab, Cancer pagurus. Between 1904 and 1914, one million lobster larvae were released from hatcheries in Dunedin, but the species did not become established there.|$|E

50|$|Hybrids {{with its}} close relative, B. oblongifolia (fern-leaved banksia) can be {{sometimes}} found where both <b>species</b> occur (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> near Bulli in the Illawarra), with features intermediate between both species.|$|R
5|$|Between Sydney and Brisbane, B.integrifolia {{is found}} up to 200 {{kilometres}} (125mi) inland, with B.integrifolia subsp. monticola {{occurring in the}} Blue Mountains at altitudes up to 1500 metres (5000ft). There it grows on better quality volcanic or rocky soils derived from granites and basalts, and would experience up to 100 frosts per year. In this montane habitat, it occurs in association with Eucalyptus <b>species</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> E.viminalis (manna gum) and E.pauciflora (snow gum), and also rainforest <b>species</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Nothofagus moorei (Antarctic beech) and Orites excelsa (prickly ash).|$|E
5|$|Decaying {{organic matter}} {{is a primary}} diet for many species. This can range from dung, which is {{consumed}} by coprophagous <b>species</b> (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> certain scarab beetles in the Scarabaeidae), to dead animals, which are eaten by necrophagous <b>species</b> (<b>such</b> <b>as</b> the carrion beetles, Silphidae). Some beetles found in dung and carrion are in fact predatory. These include members of the Histeridae and Silphidae, preying on the larvae of coprophagous and necrophagous insects. Many beetles feed under bark, some feed on wood while others feed on fungi growing on wood or leaf-litter. Some beetles have special mycangia, structures for the transport of fungal spores.|$|E
5|$|From {{the point}} of view of animal and plant breeders, there are several kinds of hybrid formed from crosses within a <b>species,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> between {{different}} breeds.|$|E

5|$|Fruitbodies of L.holopus are {{a source}} of food for fly <b>species</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Pegomya winthemi (family Anthomyiidae) and Megaelia pygmaeoides (family Phoridae).|$|E
5|$|Hawaiian {{monk seals}} mainly prey on reef {{dwelling}} bony fish, {{but they also}} prey on cephalopods and crustaceans. Juveniles and sub-adults prey more on smaller octopus <b>species,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Octopus leteus and O. hawaiiensis, nocturnal octopi species, and eels than do adult Hawaiian monk seals. Adult seals feed mostly on larger octopus <b>species</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> O. cyanea. Hawaiian monk seals have a broad and diverse diet due to foraging plasticity which allows them to be opportunistic predators that feed {{on a wide variety}} of available prey. Tiger sharks and Galapagos sharks are both predators of the Hawaiian Monk Seal.|$|E
5|$|Internal parasites of {{the alpine}} pika include many worm <b>species,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Schizorchis altaica, Cephaluris andrejevi, Heligmosomum dubinini, and Eugenuris schumakovitschi.Schizorchis altaica {{was found in}} {{individuals}} inhabiting the southern Altai mountains, and Heligmosomum dubinini in those inhabiting the Sayan and Altai mountains.|$|E
