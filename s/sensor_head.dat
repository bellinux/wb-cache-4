40|$|A new {{magnetic}} nanoparticle {{detection system}} {{by using a}} fundamental mode orthogonal fluxgate (FM-OFG) gradiometer and ac magnetizing coil has been developed. The FM-OFG gradiometer has an active canceling coil on each of its <b>sensor</b> <b>heads</b> against the common magnetic field input to avoid the saturation of the amorphous wire core by a strong ac magnetic field.

50|$|As an alternative, an {{oscillating}} {{movement of the}} entire <b>sensor</b> <b>head</b> can be carried out, this is, however, only considered a special application of a one-dimensionally measuring system. An advantage of the laser scanner is that, with according processing speed, the lighting conditions can be adapted for every single point-shaped distance measurement which results in illumination uniformity. Moreover, due to the point-shaped illumination, the laser point is through the concentrated laser power and also through appropriate optical filters, compared with the interfering arc radiation, easier to detect by the detection element.The light-section sensor avoids the disadvantage of moving parts in the <b>sensor</b> <b>head</b> (Figure 6). Here, the surface is not scanned pointwise, the entire geometry is, moreover, captured in one image. For this purpose, the point-shaped laser beam is expanded via an optics to a line which is projected {{onto the surface of}} the workpiece transverse to the groove in accordance with the scan line of the scanner. The laser line is, in accordance with the same geometrical principle of triangulation, again acquired with a detector element, this time, however, two-dimensionally. For the acquisition, CCD and CMOS cameras with the above-mentioned properties can be used.|$|E
