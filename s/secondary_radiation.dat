5|$|In future manned interplanetary spacecraft, 10B has a {{theoretical}} role as structural material (as boron fibers or BN nanotube material) which would also serve a special {{role in the}} radiation shield. One of the difficulties in dealing with cosmic rays, which are mostly high energy protons, is that some <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation</b> from interaction of cosmic rays and spacecraft materials is high energy spallation neutrons. Such neutrons can be moderated by materials high in light elements such as polyethylene, but the moderated neutrons {{continue to be a}} radiation hazard unless actively absorbed in the shielding. Among light elements that absorb thermal neutrons, 6Li and 10B appear as potential spacecraft structural materials which serve both for mechanical reinforcement and radiation protection.|$|E
25|$|When {{cosmic rays}} enter the Earth's {{atmosphere}} they collide with atoms and molecules, mainly oxygen and nitrogen. The interaction produces {{a cascade of}} lighter particles, a so-called air shower <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation</b> that rains down, including x-rays, muons, protons, alpha particles, pions, electrons, and neutrons. All of the produced particles stay within about one degree of the primary particle's path.|$|E
25|$|The {{fluorescence}} {{process is}} inefficient, and the <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation</b> is much weaker than the primary beam. Furthermore, the <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation</b> from lighter elements is of relatively low energy (long wavelength) and has low penetrating power, and is severely attenuated if the beam passes through air for any distance. Because of this, for high-performance analysis, the path from tube to sample to detector is maintained under vacuum (around 10 Pa residual pressure). This means in practice {{that most of}} the working parts of the instrument have to be located in a large vacuum chamber. The problems of maintaining moving parts in vacuum, and of rapidly introducing and withdrawing the sample without losing vacuum, pose major challenges for the design of the instrument. For less demanding applications, or when the sample is damaged by a vacuum (e.g. a volatile sample), a helium-swept X-ray chamber can be substituted, with some loss of low-Z (Z = atomic number) intensities.|$|E

40|$|International audienceTargeted {{molecular}} imaging with ultrasound {{contrast agent}} microbubbles {{is achieved by}} incorporating targeting ligands on the bubble coating and allows for specific imaging of tissues affected by diseases. Improved understanding of the interplay between the acoustic forces acting on the bubbles during insonation with ultrasound and other forces (e. g. shear due to blood flow, binding of targeting ligands to receptors on cell membranes) can help improve the efficacy of this technique. This work focuses {{on the effects of}} the <b>secondary</b> acoustic <b>radiation</b> force, which causes bubbles to attract each other and may affect the adhesion of targeted bubbles. First, we examine the translational dynamics of ultrasound contrast agent microbubbles in contact with (but not adherent to) a semi-rigid membrane due to the <b>secondary</b> acoustic <b>radiation</b> force. An equation of motion that effectively accounts for the proximity of the membrane is developed, and the predictions of the model are compared with experimental data extracted from optical recordings at 15 million frames per second. A time-averaged model is also proposed and validated. In {{the second part of the}} paper, initial results on the translation due to the <b>secondary</b> acoustic <b>radiation</b> force of targeted, adherent bubbles are presented. Adherent bubbles are also found to move due to <b>secondary</b> acoustic <b>radiation</b> force, and a restoring force is observed that brings them back to their initial positions. For increasing magnitude of the <b>secondary</b> acoustic <b>radiation</b> force, a threshold is reached above which the adhesion of targeted microbubbles is disrupted. This points to the fact that <b>secondary</b> acoustic <b>radiation</b> forces can cause adherent bubbles to detach and alter the spatial distribution of targeted contrast agents bound to tissues during activation with ultrasound. While the details of the rupture of intermolecular bonds remain elusive, this work motivates the use of the <b>secondary</b> acoustic <b>radiation</b> force to measure the strength of adhesion of targeted microbubbles...|$|R

25|$|Cosmic rays {{also cause}} {{elemental}} transmutation in the atmosphere, in which <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation</b> {{generated by the}} cosmic rays combines with atomic nuclei in the atmosphere to generate different nuclides. Many so-called cosmogenic nuclides can be produced, but probably the most notable is carbon-14, which is produced by interactions with nitrogen atoms. These cosmogenic nuclides eventually reach the Earth's surface and {{can be incorporated into}} living organisms. The production of these nuclides varies slightly with short-term variations in solar cosmic ray flux, but is considered practically constant over long scales of thousands to millions of years. The constant production, incorporation into organisms and relatively short half-life of carbon-14 are the principles used in radiocarbon dating of ancient biological materials, such as wooden artifacts or human remains.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{sources of}} gamma rays on Earth are {{observed}} in the gamma decay of radionuclides and <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation</b> from atmospheric interactions with cosmic ray particles. There are rare terrestrial natural sources, such as lightning strikes and terrestrial gamma-ray flashes, that produce gamma rays not of a nuclear origin. Additionally, gamma rays are produced {{by a number of}} astronomical processes in which very high-energy electrons are produced, that in turn cause secondary gamma rays via bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton scattering, and synchrotron radiation. However, a large fraction of such astronomical gamma rays are screened by Earth's atmosphere and can only be detected by spacecraft. Gamma rays are produced by nuclear fusion in stars including the Sun (such as the CNO cycle), but are absorbed or inelastically scattered by the stellar material, reducing their energy, before escaping and are not observable from Earth as gamma rays.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{sources of}} gamma rays on Earth include gamma decay from {{naturally}} occurring radioisotopes such as potassium-40, {{and also as}} a <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation</b> from various atmospheric interactions with cosmic ray particles. Some rare terrestrial natural sources that produce gamma rays that are not of a nuclear origin, are lightning strikes and terrestrial gamma-ray flashes, which produce high energy emissions from natural high-energy voltages. Gamma rays are produced {{by a number of}} astronomical processes in which very high-energy electrons are produced. Such electrons produce secondary gamma rays by the mechanisms of bremsstrahlung, inverse Compton scattering and synchrotron radiation. A large fraction of such astronomical gamma rays are screened by Earth's atmosphere and must be detected by spacecraft. Notable artificial sources of gamma rays include fission such as occurs in nuclear reactors, and high energy physics experiments, such as neutral pion decay and nuclear fusion.|$|E

Very large circular accelerators are invariably built in underground tunnels a few metres wide to minimize the disruption and cost of building such a structure on the surface, and to provide shielding against intense <b>secondary</b> <b>radiations</b> that occur, which are extremely penetrating at high energies.|$|R

25|$|Cosmic {{rays are}} high-energy radiation, mainly {{originating}} outside the Solar System {{and even from}} distant galaxies. Upon impact with the Earth's atmosphere, cosmic rays can produce showers of secondary particles that sometimes reach the surface. Composed primarily of high-energy protons and atomic nuclei, they are of mysterious origin. Data from the Fermi Space Telescope (2013) found that the intensity is, in fact, greater from the west, proving that most primaries are positive. During the years from 1930 to 1945, {{a wide variety of}} investigations confirmed that the primary cosmic rays are mostly protons, and the <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation</b> produced in the atmosphere is primarily electrons, photons and muons. In 1948, observations with nuclear emulsions carried by balloons to {{near the top of the}} atmosphere showed that approximately 10% of the primaries are helium nuclei (alpha particles) and 1% are heavier nuclei of the elements such as carbon, iron, and lead.|$|E
25|$|The Earth and {{all living}} things on it are {{constantly}} bombarded by radiation from outer space. This radiation primarily consists of positively charged ions from protons to iron and larger nuclei derived sources outside our solar system. This radiation interacts with atoms in the atmosphere to create an air shower of <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation,</b> including X-rays, muons, protons, alpha particles, pions, electrons, and neutrons. The immediate dose from cosmic radiation is largely from muons, neutrons, and electrons, and this dose varies {{in different parts of}} the world based largely on the geomagnetic field and altitude. For example, the city of Denver in the United States (at 1650 meters elevation) receives a cosmic ray dose roughly twice that of a location at sea level. This radiation is much more intense in the upper troposphere, around 10km altitude, and is thus of particular concern for airline crews and frequent passengers, who spend many hours per year in this environment. During their flights airline crews typically get an extra dose on the order of 2.2mSv (220 mrem) per year.|$|E
2500|$|Unlike optical lithography, {{there are}} {{multiple}} exposure limits, identified as the top dose, bottom dose, and critical dose, whose values must be determined experimentally for a proper exposure. [...] The exposure must be sufficient {{to meet the requirements}} of the bottom dose, the exposure under which a photoresist residue will remain, and the top dose, the exposure over which the photoresist will foam. [...] The critical dose is the exposure at which unexposed resist begins to be attacked. [...] Due to the insensitivity of PMMA, a typical exposure time for a [...] thick PMMA is six hours. [...] During exposure, <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation</b> effects such as Fresnel diffraction, mask and substrate fluorescence, and the generation of Auger electrons and photoelectrons can lead to overexposure.|$|E

This {{was accomplished by}} measurement of the contributions to dose according to profile, particle type, time, and position (location) within the spacecraft. Both active- and passive-dosimetry data collected in this experiment showed that no radiation hazard was associated with manned space operations within the Gemini spacecraft at altitudes as great as 310 kilometers in the South Atlantic anomaly region. This conclusion is warranted also by theoretical calculations...|$|R

He noted that this process possibly can explain where the energy of radioactive substances comes from - however, he stated that an internal cause of radioactivity is more probable. In 1911 Thomson went back to this subject in his article [...] "Matter" [...] in the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition.

50|$|Material {{shielding}} {{can be effective}} against galactic cosmic rays, but thin shielding may actually make the problem worse {{for some of the}} higher energy rays, because more shielding causes an increased amount of <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation,</b> although thick shielding could counter such too. The aluminium walls of the ISS, for example, are believed to produce a net reduction in radiation exposure. In interplanetary space, however, it is believed that thin aluminium shielding would give a net increase in radiation exposure but would gradually decrease as more shielding is added to capture generated <b>secondary</b> <b>radiation.</b>|$|E
