DBDN (Di n-butyl dodecandioate) {{is a kind of}} EHD fluid and a dielectric organic liquid. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to develop a lightweight and compact fluid actuator which makes use of such properties of EHD fluid. We think that it is useful to apply EHD actuators to an industrial robot as a lightweight actuator. In order to develop such an actuator, we first investigated the characteristics, the relation between the generated pressure and applied voltage to DBDN fluid. In this study, we tested two kinds of pumping module; direct <b>type</b> and <b>suction</b> <b>type.</b> The direct type module consists of two doughnut shaped electrodes. The <b>suction</b> <b>type</b> module consists of a flat plate electrode and a cylindrical electrode. We investigated the relation between applied voltage and generated differential pressure using these modules. Further, we investigated the influence of geometric parameters on the characteristics of the module. As a result of the experiment, It was found that the <b>suction</b> <b>type</b> was able to generate much higher differential pressure, more than 320 times, compared with the direct type module. It was observed that the maximum differential pressure was 3. 6 kPa when the voltage of 10 kV was applied by using the one-stage <b>suction</b> <b>type</b> module.

40|$|Background : Ventilator-associated {{pneumonia}} (VAP), {{a frequent}} nosocomial {{infection in the}} intensive care, is associated with considerable morbidity. Endotracheal suctioning is routinely performed in mechanically ventilated patients to clear secretions. This study assessed if there were advantages of closed endotracheal suctioning (CES) over open endotracheal suctioning (OES) with respect to clinical outcomes. Materials and Methods : Trials comparing CES with OES were identified by search of MEDLINE&#x 00 D 2; (1966 -July 2006) and bibliographies of relevant articles. Only trials reporting VAP and/or mortality were considered. Studies reporting only physiological outcomes were excluded. Statistical Analysis Used : A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed using the random-effects estimator. The effect of <b>suctioning</b> <b>type</b> on VAP and mortality was reported as risk difference (RD) and duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) as mean weighted difference (MWD). Results : Nine RCTs fulfilled criteria for inclusion. There was no differential treatment effect of <b>suctioning</b> <b>type</b> (closed versus open, n = 9 studies) on VAP (RD - 0. 01; 95 &#x 0025; CI - 0. 05, 0. 03; P = 0. 63) or on mortality (n = 5; RD 0. 01; 95 &#x 0025; CI - 0. 04, 0. 05; P = 0. 8).

Remarkable difference in the hot permeability of the coat is found even if the room temperature permeability of coat is the same.

The SBO approach replaces direct optimization of the high fidelity (accurate but computationally expensive) model by iterative optimization of a properly corrected low fidelity model obtained from low fidelity CFD simulations. The optimum contraction design is verified using high fidelity CFD simulation, as well as by experimental measurements...|$|R

The paper describes comparative assessment of two distinct experimental strategies of aerodynamic predictions by conventional wind tunnel approach and its subsequent validation with advanced computational procedures, carried out as a part of design process of a small hybrid car proposed to be named as ADRENe. The experimental investigations were performed on an open circuit <b>suction</b> <b>type</b> wind tunnel having a 30 cm x 30 cm x 100 cm test section, on a geometrically similar, reduced scale (1 : 15) clay model, while the three dimensional computational analysis was carried out using Gambit as the preprocessing software and Fluent as the solver and post processor. A good agreement between performance values obtained independently by two experimental methods, suggests their reliability and suitability for further experimentation purposes. The comparison with computational approach shows that the computed drag forces and pressure distributions agree well with the experimental values over the entire range of air velocities, however, the agreement with the data for drag coefficient varies, which appears to suggest a higher degree of dependency on the grid quality and elements selection...|$|R

We have previously shown that fish have an acute sensitivity to infrasound also, with acceleration thresholds {{in the range}} of 10 (- 5) m s(- 2). In addition, infrasound at high intensities around 10 (- 2) m s(- 2) elicits strong and sustained avoidance responses in several fish species. In the present study, the possible triggering of C-escapes by infrasonic single-cycle vibrations was examined in juvenile roach Rutilus rutilus. The fish were accelerated in a controlled and quantifiable manner using a swing system. The applied stimuli simulated essential components of the accelerations that a small fish would encounter in the hydrodynamic flow field produced by a predatory fish. Typical C- and S-type escape responses were induced by accelerations within the infrasonic range with a threshold of 0. 023 m s(- 2) for an initial acceleration at 6. 7 Hz. Response trajectories were on average {{in the same direction as}} the initial acceleration. Unexpectedly, startle behaviours mainly occurred in the trailing half of the test chamber, in which the fish were subjected to linear acceleration in combination with compression, i. e. the expected stimuli produced by an approaching predator.

Flat seed corn was better in seed quality than round seed corn. The gravity table was efficient in separating seed corn into fractions of different quality along the discharge edge of the gravity table deck.

The light seed obtained from the low side of the gravity table did not meet the seed requirement and must be discarded. The medium light fraction may be re-conditioned to recover fractions of acceptable seed quality.

40|$|International audienceMountain {{building}} at convergent margins requires tectonic forces that can overcome frictional resistance along large-scale thrust faults {{and support the}} gravitational potential energy stored within the thickened crust of the orogen. A general, dynamic model for this process is still lacking. Here we propose that mountain belts can be classified between two end-members. First, those of "slab pull" type, where subduction is mainly confined to the upper mantle, and rollback trench motion lead to moderately thick crustal stacks, {{such as in the}} Mediterranean. Second, those of "slab suction" type, where whole-mantle convection cells ("conveyor belts") lead to the more extreme expressions of orogeny, such as the largely thickened crust and high plateaus of present-day Tibet and the Altiplano. For the slab <b>suction</b> <b>type,</b> deep mantle convection produces the unique conditions to drag plates toward each other, irrespective of their nature and other boundary conditions. We support this hypothesis by analyzing the orogenic, volcanic, and convective history associated with the Tertiary formation of the Andes after ~ 40 [*]Ma and Himalayas after collision at ~ 55 [*]Ma. Based on mantle circulation modeling and tectonic reconstructions, we surmise that the forces necessary to sustain slab-suction mountain building in those orogens derive, after transient slab ponding, from the mantle drag induced upon slab penetration into the lower mantle, and from an associated surge of mantle upwelling beneath Africa. This process started at ~ 65 - 55 [*]Ma for Tibet-Himalaya, when the Tethyan slab penetrated into the lower mantle, and ~ 10 Myr later in the Andes, when the Nazca slab did. This surge of mantle convection drags plates against each other, generating the necessary compressional forces to create and sustain these two orogenic belts. If our model is correct, the available geological records of orogeny can be used to decipher time-dependent mantle convection, with implications for the supercontinental cycle...|$|R

40|$|One {{particular}} characteristic {{observed in}} unsteady shear layers is the phase shift {{relative to the}} main flow. In attached boundary layers this will have an effect both on the instantaneous skin friction and heat transfer. In separation bubbles the contribution to the drag {{is dominated by the}} pressure distribution. However, the most significant effect appears to be the phase shift on the transition process. Unsteady transition behaviour may determine the bursting of the bubble resulting in an un-recoverable full separation. An early analysis of the phase shift was performed by Stokes for the incompressible boundary layer of an oscillating wall and an oscillating main flow. An amplitude overshoot within the shear layer as well as a phase shift were observed that {{can be attributed to the}} relatively slow diffusion of viscous stresses compared to the fast change of pressure. Experiments in a low speed facility with the boundary layer of a flat plate were evaluated in respect to phase shift. A pressure distribution similar to that on the suction surface of a turbomachinery aerofoil was superimposed generating a typical transitional separation bubble. A periodically unsteady main flow in the <b>suction</b> <b>type</b> wind tunnel was introduced via a rotating flap downstream of the test section. The experiments covered a range of the three similarity parameters of momentum-loss-thickness Reynolds-number of 92 to 226 and Strouhal-number (reduced frequency) of 0. 0001 to 0. 0004 at the separation point, and an amplitude range up to 19 %. The free stream turbulence level was less than 1 %. Upstream of the separation point the phase shift in the laminar boundary layer does not appear to be affected significantly bay either of the three parameters. The trend perpendicular to the wall is similar to the Stokes analysis. The problem scales well with the wave velocity introduced by Stokes, however, the lag of the main flow near the wall is less than indicated analytically.

(some col.) Experimental and computational results regarding turbulent mixing of passage flow and the coolant from a high-pressure turbine blade trailing edge cooling scheme are documented. Special interest {{is devoted to}} gaining a fundamental understanding of the thermal protection provided by the cooling scheme. The trailing edge cooling scheme is a scaled version of a generic scheme, tested in a <b>suction</b> <b>type</b> wind tunnel. The scaled model is three-dimensional with rectangular ribs. Three different lip geometries (square, single round, and double round) are tested. The freestream Reynolds number, based upon the lip thickness, is fixed at 10, 200. Primarily, three blowing ratios, M= 1. 5, M= 1. 0, and M= 0. 5 are documented. A hot-wire sensor and a thermocouple are placed inside the slot and detailed measurements of velocities, turbulence intensities, and temperatures are acquired. Values of adiabatic effectiveness obtained on the model surface quantify thermal protection. Spectral analysis of the hot-wire signal is performed at various locations in the flow field. Spectra indicate a coherent mechanism of mixing. This clear unsteadiness is attributed to vortex shedding from the lip. It is shown that effectiveness increases as the blowing ratio increases. This document suggests also that lip geometry is an influential parameter for this cooling scheme. Effectiveness is greatly increased when a rounded lip is utilized. In one case, additional blowing ratios (M= 0. 75 and M= 1. 25) were tested. Experiments concluded that above M= 1. 25, effectiveness is insensitive to blowing ratio. Two-dimensional simulations are presented for M= 1. 5, M= 1. 0 and M= 0. 5. They use various Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes turbulence closure models. The frequencies of unsteadiness are well modeled but, in general, effectiveness is over-predicted.

This <b>type</b> of flow was assumed because it was anticipated that the slenderness of the wing would preclude attached flow at the required lift coefficient. A constraint was imposed in that the camber deflections were to be restricted by a realistic structural-box requirement. The resulting application yielded mean-camber shapes which produced effective suction levels equivalent to 77 percent of the full-planar leading-edge value at the design lift coefficient...|$|R
50|$|A subtype of {{the open}} {{collection}} system is the single user <b>suction</b> source. These <b>type</b> of pumps have added hygienic benefit of all the parts that generate the suction or {{come in contact with}} breast milk stay with the mother. The parts that generate the suction are external to the pump, and can be removed, providing outstanding protection against cross contamination. These pumps are rental or hospital grade breast pumps. Using a pump of this type virtually eliminates the chance of cross contamination of the pump from mother to mother.|$|R
40|$|Wall {{temperature}} and velocity of a stagnation region {{of a plane}} impinging jet were measured by using thermochromic liquid crystal (TLC) and PIV. The plane jet was excited {{in time and space}} by adding <b>suction</b> / blowing <b>type</b> disturbances produced by servomotor-driven injectors. Surface temperature distribution showed unsteady streaks in parallel to a wall jet direction. The lowest spatial-averaged-wall {{temperature and}} vorticity intensity on the wall could be realized when the phase angle of the adjacent disturbance-wave train was φ=π, in which chain-link-fence structures were expected to be formed in the free-jet region upstream of the stagnation region. 抄録は英...|$|R
40|$|Ongoing {{anatomical}} development typically {{results in}} a gradual maturation of the feeding movements from larval to adult fishes. Adult seahorses are known to capture prey by rotating their longsnouted head extremely quickly towards prey, followed by powerful <b>suction.</b> This <b>type</b> of <b>suction</b> is powered by elastic recoil and requires very precise coordination of {{the movements of the}} associated feeding structures, making it an all-or-none phenomenon. Here, we show that newborn Hippocampus reidi are able to successfully feed using an extremely rapid and powerful snout rotation combined with a high-volume suction, surpassing that observed in adult seahorses. An inverse dynamic analysis shows that an elastic recoil mechanism is also used to power head rotation in newborn H. reidi. This illustrates how extreme levels of performance in highly complex musculoskeletal systems can be present at birth given a delayed birth and rapid development of functionally important structures. The fact that the head skeleton of newborn seahorses is still largely cartilaginous may not be problematic because the hydrodynamic stress on the rotating snout appeared considerably lower than in adult syngnathids...|$|R
40|$|Abstract]: This {{project is}} to build a wall {{climbing}} robot. This robot is a <b>suction</b> <b>type</b> of wall climbing robot; using PIC to do the interfacing, control the movement of the robot, ventilation fan and the sensors. The position sensors are used to sense any things blocking its path while it is climbing up, therefore it can be rotated left, right, up and down. The on-board pump has been replaced by computer fan which will lower the cost as well as the weight of the original product. The cost of building this robot must be cheaper than the commercial robots. BACKGROUND In all suction adhesion robot that are used for wall climbing robot, they used onboard pump that created a pressure drop inside the vacuum cups that are pressed against the wall or ceiling. As the vacuum cup are pressed against the wall, the on board pump will start to pump the air in the vacuum cup out to the surrounding. After some time, the pressure inside the vacuum cup is lower than that outside the vacuum cup thus it is able to “stick” onto the wall. This type of wall climbing robot requires a smooth and flat vertical surface, therefore if there is a crack in the wall or the vertical surface is uneven, it will not work. Another problem of this type of robot is that it is much slower than other types of wall climbing robot, as it needs time to build up the required pressure to hold itself on to the wall. The suction adhesion robots are normally used on valley bridges and the temperature could be around 0 to 50 degree Celsius. As for the weight, this type of robot should not be more than 35 kg, thus the body of this robot should be make of non metallic material. The centre of gravity of the robot must be kept as close as to the vertical surface as possible, as the force required to hold the whole weight of the robot will be reduced. Although this kind of robot is normally used to do the cleaning for high buildings and under high way bridges, this will in turn replace human beings thus reducing the accident rate. This will further increase the human being rate of living...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a CFD and experimental analysis {{associated with the}} parameter compressor fouling and a CFD analysis associated with the parameter on-line compressor washing of industrial gas turbines. On-line compressor washing is very popular and quite effective in the industrial gas turbine operational scheme. Many companies apply on-line washing with the engine running at normal speed {{so as to avoid}} downtime periods for off-line cleanings that could cause significant economic drawbacks. At this thesis vital parameters affecting compressor cleaning of an industrial gas turbine were examined and combined in such a way so as to provide adequate coverage of the frontal inlet guide vane area which is critical for effective cleaning. The parameters investigated were water injection nozzle position, inclination with respect to the engine centerline, injection velocity and nozzle spray angles. However, before applying compressor washing, compressor fouling comes into consideration. For this purpose a compressor cascade tunnel (test rig) was designed and come into operation in order to examine different levels of fouling. The cascade test rig involved as well a washing kit for future cleaning of the cascade blades. This work related to the cascade design released a lot of information about designing <b>suction</b> <b>type</b> compressor cascade test rigs by analysing the flow inside the cascade rig computationally and three-dimensionally via CFD tools. The results in terms of the quality of flow obtained for the current test rig were also compared with modified versions of the test rig, one which involved a bigger plenum area behind the cascade test section and one involving the current rig running in a blowing type mode. The CFD results coming out from the compressor cascade tunnel for the different fouling levels, were analysed in terms of mass flow capacity and polytropic efficiency reduction due to fouling by using Howell’s theory (1945) and they were used as inputs for running performance simulation in terms of an industrial gas turbine engine using the performance simulation code Turbomatch. Therefore, a correlation between cascade fouling and real engine uniformly stage spread fouling was achieved. At high levels fouling where the 254 microns roughness height takes place, the nondimensional air mass flow reduction can reach levels of 1. 6 % and the drop in compressor efficiency can touch the value of 5 %. The CFD results obtained after running all the simulation scheme for the different roughness levels, were compared to the actual experimental results coming from running the compressor cascade rig with the same fouling scheme of roughness. Applying Howell’s theory (1945), the fouled cascade was correlated to a uniformly fouled stage and a real industrial gas turbine. This time input in the Turbomatch code was the percentage deterioration in compressor efficiency calculated from correlated cascade data. This deterioration reaches a high level of 11 % when the fouling particle size is 254 microns. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
