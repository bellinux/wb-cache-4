50|$|Guillaume Rouillé (Gulielmus Rovillium; 1518 - 1589) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} humanist bookseller-printers in 16th-century Lyon. He invented the pocket book format called the <b>sextodecimo,</b> printed with sixteen leaves to the folio sheet, half the size of the octavo format, and published many works of history and poetry as well as medicine, in addition to his useful compilations and handbooks.|$|E
50|$|He {{was a man}} of {{original}} thought and vigorous expression, and of extensive and accurate learning. No one could meet him, even casually, without admiration of his unusual gifts. He published in 1836, anonymously, two volumes of essays, entitled The Puritan (<b>sextodecimo,</b> pp. 248, 268); and also, in 1861, Solomon's Song, translated and explained (duodecimo, pp. 329), besides numerous sermons, addresses, and lectures. Bowdoin College gave him in 1850 the degree of Doctor of Divinity.|$|E
50|$|These various {{production}} {{methods are}} referred to as the format of the book. These terms are often abbreviated, using 4to for quarto, 8vo for octavo, and so on. The octavo format, with eight leaves per gathering, has half the page size of the quarto format before trimming. Smaller formats include the duodecimo (or twelvemo), with twelve leaves per sheet and pages one-third the size of the quarto format, and the <b>sextodecimo</b> (or sixteenmo), with sixteen leaves per sheet, half the size of the octavo format and one quarter the size of the quarto. The vast majority of books were printed in the folio, quarto, octavo or duodecimo formats.|$|E
5000|$|The Induction to this {{revised version}} is a metatheatrical one, {{in which the}} play's actors and its onstage spectators comment on the drama that is to follow and discuss the [...] "bitterness" [...] of its satire. King's Men actors Richard Burbage, John Lowin, and Henry Condell appear as themselves, while William Sly appears as a young theater-goer and John Sinklo appears as [...] "Doomsday," [...] his cousin. The gallant asks Condell how King's Men came to mount a Blackfriar's play, and Condell answers, [...] "Why not Malevole in folio with us, as Jeronimo in decimosexto with them?" [...] He {{suggests}} that the boys (compared to a <b>sextodecimo</b> sheet) had stolen a King's Men's play, possibly a sequel to Thomas Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy, and so they stole Blackfriars's Malcontent for their folio-sized actors.|$|E
5000|$|Martinus de Arles y Andosilla (1451? - 1521) was {{doctor of}} {{theology}} and canon in Pamplona and archdeacon of Aibar, author of a tractatus de superstitionibus, contra maleficia seu sortilegia quae hodie vigent in orbe terrarum (1515), a work on demonology {{in the context of}} the Early Modern witch-hunts. Martin believed witches (sorginak) to be particularly numerous among the population of Navarra, and the Basques of the Pyrenees in general. He recommends stern measures of an inquisition against this. His depiction of witchcraft is, however, based on sources predating the Malleus maleficarum, arguing against its simplistic depiction of witchcraft (falsa opinione ... credentes cum Diana vel Herodia nocturnis horis equitare, vel se in alias creaturas transformare). The work was printed in Paris in 1517, and in Rome in 1559 (142 <b>sextodecimo</b> pages).|$|E

5000|$|Chluain Fiacla {{has been}} {{identified}} with the church of Clonfeakle, in the townland of Tullydowey, parish of Clonfeacle, partly in the baronies of Armagh and Oneilland West, County Armagh, but chiefly in the barony of Dungannon Middle, Co. Tyrone. This identification is certainly correct as the present church of Clonfeacle is named St. Jarlath’s. That it was also so called in medieval times is evident from papal documents. For example the entry in the Lateran Regesta for August 1446 states- To the abbot of St. Patricks, Newry, in the diocese of Dromore, and the archdeacon and the official of Dromore. Mandate (the pope having been informed by Thomas Oculean, clerk, of the diocese of Armagh, that Solomon Ocorra, rector called prebendary of the parish church of St. Yrlatheus the Bishop, Cluoynfechana, in the diocese of Armagh, wont to be governed by canons of Armagh only, has, when excommunicate and publicly proclaimed excommunicate, celebrated and taken part in masses and other divine offices in contempt of the Keys, thereby incurring irregularity, and has committed simony) if Thomas, who, {{on account of the}} inordinate favours which Solomon has in the city and diocese of Armagh, has no hope of obtaining justice therein, will accuse Solomon before them, etc. as usual, to summon Solomon, and if they find the above to be true, to deprive him, and in that event to make provision to the said Thomas of a canonry of Armagh and collate and assign to him the said rectory called a prebend, value not exceeding 14 marks sterling.
