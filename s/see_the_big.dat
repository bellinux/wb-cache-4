5|$|The underconnectivity theory hypothesizes {{underfunctioning}} high-level neural {{connections and}} synchronization, {{along with an}} excess of low-level processes. It maps well to general-processing theories such as weak central coherence theory, which hypothesizes that a limited ability to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> picture underlies the central disturbance in ASD. A related theory—enhanced perceptual functioning—focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and perceptual operations in autistic individuals.|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{concluded in}} New York City, where filming occurred over two days. Filming locations in New York City included Park Avenue and Central Park. For scenes {{taking place in}} Manhattan, visual effects supervisor Jake Morrison shot aerial footage for over three days to use as background plates, elaborating that his main objective was to [...] "get as much aerial work in as possible for the audience to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> expanses, the wide establishing shots, while also {{making sure that the}} effects work doesn't look too computer generated". [...] "We're getting much better at making entirely computer-generated environments," [...] Morrison explained, [...] "but {{there is no substitute for}} starting with a real image and adding what you need." ...|$|E
500|$|The 30 March 1967 photo {{session with}} Cooper also {{produced}} {{the back cover}} and the inside gatefold, which the musicologist Ian Inglis describes as conveying [...] "an obvious and immediate warmth... which distances it from the sterility and artifice typical of such images". McCartney explained: [...] "One {{of the things we}} were very much into in those days was eye messages... So with Michael Cooper's inside photo, we all said, 'Now look into this camera and really say I love you! Really try and feel love; really give love through this! It'll come out; it'll show; it's an attitude.' And that's what that is, {{if you look at it}} you'll <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> effort from the eyes." [...] The album's inner sleeve featured artwork by the Dutch design team the Fool that eschewed for the first time the standard white paper in favour of an abstract pattern of waves of maroon, red, pink and white. Included with the album as a bonus gift was a sheet of cardboard cut-outs designed by Blake and Haworth, a postcard-sized portrait of Sgt. Pepper based on a statue from Lennon's house that was used on the front cover, a fake moustache, two sets of sergeant stripes, two lapel badges and a stand-up cut-out of the Beatles in their satin uniforms. Moore believes that the inclusion of these items helped fans [...] "pretend to be in the band". However, many others have speculated that there may be a deeper meaning.|$|E

2500|$|All brigades on the Western Front were reorganised {{after the}} heavy losses of 1917. Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby's brigade lost its English battalions {{and became an}} entirely Scottish {{formation}} as it prepared for renewed fighting in 1918. The divisional history records that 120 Brigade 'suffered a severe loss on the 15th [...] when the brigade commander was sent home. General Willoughby had been in very poor health for some time, but had struggled to remain at his duty in order to <b>see</b> <b>the</b> <b>big</b> [...] offensive, though the delay in {{the opening of the}} attack rendered this impossible'. To the regret of his divisional commander, Heathcote–Drummond-Willoughby was invalided back to the UK after two-and-a-half years in continuous command. His brigade was virtually destroyed during the subsequent German Spring Offensive.|$|E
2500|$|A Democrat-turned-Republican, Caldwell first won {{the general}} {{election}} for state senator for Benton and Carroll counties in 1968, when he unseated the veteran Democratic incumbent, Russell Elrod (1904-1985) of Siloam Springs, who in the 1953-1954 session had been the Senate President Pro Tempore. Although he was considered a [...] "progressive" [...] or a Moderate Republican within the legislature, Caldwell recalled years later that he really had [...] "no ideology, no issue when I first ran. I just thought a two-party system was a good idea. I don't recall any of us [...] having an agenda. ...
