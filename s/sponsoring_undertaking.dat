40|$|Foreword Preface Contributors Contents This {{volume is}} the {{outgrowth}} {{of an international}} symposium held at Lincoln, Nebraska, January 20 - 24, 1969. It {{was sponsored by the}} University of Nebraska in cooperation with the American Society of Agronomy and the Crop Science Society of America with partial financing by the Rockefeller Foundation and the International Biological Program. The symposium planning committee was broadly based and was able to bring specialists from {{many parts of the world}} to the conference. Thus, the technical presentations were drawn from outstanding authorities backed up by a clear perspective of social needs. This was a happy combination which contributed greatly to the success of the conference and is shown on the printed pages of this book. Happy, too, is the realization that in this symposium the most basic of inquiry into the physiology of plants is brought to bear on solving problems of the yield of economic plants vital to man 2 ̆ 7 s existence, both now and in the long view ahead. Empiricism, successful in past decades will, we are convinced, be augmented and in some cases be replaced by the new understanding of the physiology of yield in plants. We sometimes hear that research is less enjoyable and rewarding now than formerly, partly because it is so fragmented. The output is so great that no one can keep up with more than a mere fraction of research reports and relating one part with another is often difficult. We believe the symposium presented here in book form has bridged some of these chasms. There is no reason why science cannot be put to work somewhere to assist man in his eternal quest to control his environment and satisfy his basic needs and ambitions. However, there are many examples of misguided or abortive 2 ̆ 2 advances 2 ̆ 2 which produce short-term or local gains at the risk of much larger long-term losses. Hence, as was brought out at the symposium, a certain level of technology must be evaluated in terms of its cost, its worth, and the goals men hold. The societies which <b>sponsored</b> this <b>undertaking</b> are dedicated to the encouragement of excellent science and to the dissemination of knowledge. We believe this book represents a positive and useful effort toward both...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The 'soft metrics' project was a defence industry <b>sponsored</b> research activity <b>undertaken</b> to develop project performance analysis and control capabilities for systems engineering operations within BAE SYSTEMS. The 'soft' focus of this work addresses the less 'tangible' human and organisational factors that influence project effectiveness as measured by key contractuallydetermined cost, quality and time parameters related to delivery of the product. The key research objectives were: 1) to investigate the nature and influence of soft performance issues in projects, 2) to explore the extent of existing research and development knowledge for control of soft factors, 3) to develop an appropriate practical approach to the analysis and measurement of soft issues with tools to support project performance management efforts, and 4) to make a feasibility case for the research product through application and validation in operational case projects. The research approach involved in-depth, qualitative study of four relevant case projects undertaken to define the industrial context for application, support an iterative development process and validate the results of development efforts towards the specification of an integrated soft metrics tool and approach. An industry scoping study and detailed review of relevant research and operations management literature revealed a gap in current project management metrication practices regarding soft factors analysis and measurement capability. Building upon existing sociotechnical performance factors models an applied Human and Organisational Performance (HOP) modelling framework was developed for the representation of dependencies between upstream process indicators and 'outcome' effectiveness criteria in a systems engineering project context. Review of human sciences research literature and subsequent refinement through casebased investigation led to the identification of over 100 potential human and organisational performance variables with which to populate the HOP model, representing a variety of 'soft issues' known to influence performance in industry project based operations. Implicated factors were associated with issues relating to: team composition, human knowledge and experience, work group climate and cohesion, functional autonomy, task and goal characteristics, human workload, motivation, stakeholder communication and project management decision-making processes, amongst others. A variety of soft metrics and techniques for quantification of these factors were developed through a multi-facet approach to measurement that involved decomposition of broad, higher-level variables into specific sub-factors. Appropriate subjective judgement-based items and objective criteria were defined to numerically quantify variance in specific sub-factors. To provide a practical, integrated solution an application process with detailed sub-activities was developed to allow project management teams to identify and analyse 'soft' performance problem issues and select appropriate soft metrics for proactive monitoring and control within the project's lifecycle. This process was subsequently successfully implemented in three systems engineering case projects. Through implementation of a structured approach in focus groups, project managers reported {{they were able to}} identify and reason about complex human and organisational factors that had previously been managed intuitively, and relate them to specific effects upon project performance outcomes to support risk assessment. A variety of performance-critical 'system preconditions' were identified and linked to key outcome objectives within the HOP modelling framework, through their impact upon specific human activities or 'behavioural' variables that represented human performance in the project work environment. In terms of feasibility, project work groups reported that the soft metrics approach was of potentially high utility in supporting performance control through project planning, work process improvement efforts and project performance review activities, providing that practical issues associated with the level of effort currently involved in the implementation of the prototype tool were resolved. This work highlights metrication of human and organisational factors in projects as an important and viable area for future research work to support enhancement in operations performance management capabilities...|$|R
40|$|Dominicus Gundissalinus (ca. 1115 -post 1181) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} figures of the Toledan translation movement, as well as an original philosopher. In collaboration with the Jewish philosopher Abraham Ibn Daud and Iohannes Hispanus, he translated over twenty Arabic works into Latin. These translations are used by the Toledan philosopher as main sources for his original speculation, concretized in five philosophical treatises which show Gundissalinus' conviction of the strong coherence between Christian, Islamic and Jewish philosophical traditions. These works are the first Latin treatises to analyze the main Arabic and Hebrew philosophical doctrines that will constitute the theoretical basis for Latin speculation in the thirteenth century. After a brief examination of Gundissalinus' biography and his work as translator in Toledo, this dissertation focuses on Gundissalinus' metaphysical reflection, as it is presented in his original treatises. The method used herein is the doctrinal and genetic analysis of the writings, dealing with the three main aspects of Gundissalinus' metaphysical speculation: the being of God, the creatural being, and the cosmogonic causation. The aim of this study is to delineate the theoretical structure by which Gundissalinus' original ontology is built on his peculiar use of the Arabic and Hebrew works he translated and how this structure is explicitly interpreted by Gundissalinus as doctrinally coherent with the Latin philosophical tradition he aims to update. In this respect, this analysis is a comparative examination – both doctrinal and textual – of Gundissalinus and his Arabic-Hebrew sources: Avicenna, Ibn Gabirol, al-Ghazali and Ibn Daud, and his main Latin sources: Boethius, Calcidius, Thierry of Chartres, William of Conches and Hermann of Carinthia. 1. The Biographical and Philosophical Context of Gundissalinus' Work Gundissalinus is first attested in the capitulary archives of Segovia's cathedral in 1148, as archdeacon of the small town of Cuéllar. These documents show that Gundissalinus spent at least fourteen years in Segovia or Cuéllar, as he first appears in the Toledan chapter in 1162. It is likely that his activity as a translator began in this year, an <b>undertaking</b> <b>sponsored</b> by the Toledan archbishop John II and strongly linked to the presence of Abraham Ibn Daud – or «Avendauth» – in the Castilian capital. In the scientific and philosophical context provided by the so-called «Gundissalinus' circle», Abraham Ibn Daud, Iohannes Hispanus and Gundissalinus translated more than twenty philosophical works from Arabic into Latin, including Avicenna's Metaphysica and De anima, Ibn Gabirol's Fons vitae, and al-Ghazali's Summa theoricae philosophiae. Concurrently, Gundissalinus and Ibn Daud created an original philosophical speculation on many issues found in the texts they translated. The results of this reflection have been concretized in five philosophical treatises – De unitate et uno, De scientiis, De anima, De divisione philosophiae, and De processione mundi – written by Gundissalinus during the second half of the twelfth century. In these writings, the archdeacon of Cuéllar shows his deep syncretism towards different, and often divergent, philosophical traditions. Using mainly the the Arabic-Hebrew speculations to which he had access, Gundissalinus built an original doctrinal system where many core theoretical concepts, such as Avicenna's Active Intellect or Ibn Gabirol's universal hylomorphism, are thematized in the horizon offered by the Latin tradition, especially the Chartrean speculation, the Weltanschauung through which Gundissalinus interprets his sources. Gundissalinus' debt toward Chartres leads our study to a preliminary acceptation of the hypothesis, proposed by many scholars, regarding his presence there before appearing in Segovia in 1148. For this reason, the Chartrean masters are examined as main sources for Gundissalinus' metaphysics in this study: only at the end of this work will it be possible to come to a definitive conclusion regarding this fascinating hypothesis. The second part of the dissertation's first chapter examines the philosophical corpus produced by Gundissalinus, which illustrates the coherence of the metaphysical program presented in the De scientiis and the De divisione philosophiae and analyzed in the De processione mundi. This comprehensive examination of Gundissalinus' philosophical production likewise offers the means of establishing the main theoretical bonds that link the De unitate et uno, the De anima and the De processione. The chapter ends with a specific analysis of the metaphysical works composed by Gundissalinus – the De unitate and the De processione – as preliminary illustrations of the main themes discussed in subsequent chapters. 2. The Thematization of God's Being The first metaphysical aspect of Gundissalinus' reflection analyzed herein is his thematization of God's being as ontologically different from the creatural one, a viewpoint which indicates a primary doctrinal shift. In the De unitate, God is primarily characterized as the metaphysical One, the absolute and perfect Unity from which the ontological unity that constitutes creatures' being is derived. However, in the De processione, this first divine attribute has less significance, as the primary characteristic of God is found in the causal and modal ontology elaborated by Avicenna. In this perspective, God is the Necessary Existent, the self-sufficient being that causes the being of every subsequent existent. These created beings have in themselves a possible being – neutrally liable of existence as well as non-existence – that constitutes the being they are entitled to and which become a necessary being only through the causal intervention of the Necessary Existent. In this way, there is a fundamental distinction between God and these beings: God is the Necessary Existent per se, while the other beings that actually exist are necessary per aliud only, i. e. thanks to their ontogenetic cause. While the doctrine of necessary and possible being offers the main characteristics of God's being, the De processione mundi further develops His divine attributes. Apart from His necessity and metaphysical Unity, God is also characterized as pure Act. It is the Goodness in se that, through its will and its wisdom, establishes the world in an act of creation ex nihilo, that by Gundissalinus' intention, avoids any misinterpretation of God's action as a demiurgic ordination of primordial chaos. In the second part of this chapter, these aspects of Gundissalinus' thematization are analyzed through the doctrinal comparison with its sources, beginning with Avicenna. From his Metaphysica, Gundissalinus receives the aforementioned doctrine of necessary and possible being and quotes a long excerpt from this text in the De processione mundi. Nevertheless, the reception of this theory, along with a lack of reference to other Avicennian doctrines regarding the analysis of God, is crucially influenced by two writings directly related to Avicenna: al-Ghazali's Summa theoricae philosophiae and Ibn Daud's ha-Emunah ha-Ramah. These two treatises play a decisive role in Gundissalinus' hermeneutics, as they lead the Toledan philosopher to propose a clear link between the doctrine of necessary being and that of act and potency. However, many aspects of God's thematization exposed by al-Ghazali and Ibn Daud have no place in Gundissalinus' reflection, showing his lack of interest in the traditional Islamic and Hebrew doctrines concerning God's attributes. Gundissalinus' conceptualization of God as pure and absolute Unity derives from a wider range of authors, who directly and indirectly influence his works. Textual analysis shows the main source for both the De unitate's and the De processione's treatment of this concept is Ibn Gabirol. Gabirol's Fons vitae provides the basis of Gundissalinus' conception of the role of God's will and wisdom in the cosmogonic dynamics, asserting the first joining of matter and form – the former derived from God's essence, the latter from his wisdom – is operated by the divine will. Nevertheless, other sources of these features can be detected in the Latin philosophical tradition, beginning with Boethius's De Trinitate and De hebdomadibus, both examined further in detail herein. In this viewpoint, the doctrinal analysis of Thierry of Chartres' speculation, especially his Commentum super Arithmeticam Boethii, sheds light on another important and peculiar aspect of Gundissalinus' metaphysics. Indeed, examination of these writings show strong similarities in the methods (the compositio/resolutio procedure) and sensibilities (in particular, the numerological and arithmological approach) between the two authors. This connection is further supported by a direct quotation from Thierry's Commentum on the De arithmetica in the De processione, as well as Gundissalinus' adherence to numerous outcomes of Thierry's numerological doctrine. William of Conches likewise plays an important role, particularly regarding the explanation of the creative role played by the Trinity. Initially, Gundissalinus' metaphysical treatises seem reticent on this fundamental doctrine of Christian theology, but a deeper examination of the writings shows an affinity with William of Conches' treatment of Trinity, which is thematized by the Chartrean master through its specific causality on the world's creation. This rendering was sharply attacked by William of Saint- Thierry in the mid-twelfth century, and the problems arising from this position of divine Trinity as only in reference to creation seem to explain Gundissalinus' reticence on this issue.
