5|$|Following the American attack, Komori {{pulled his}} {{remaining}} {{force back to}} defend the airstrip. As {{this was not an}} Allied objective, the Japanese were not subjected to further attacks by ground troops other than occasional patrol clashes and ambushes. As a result of the <b>supply</b> <b>shortages,</b> many of the Japanese soldiers fell sick. Attempts to bring supplies in by sea from Gasmata were disrupted by U.S.Navy PT boats and the force lacked enough porters to supply itself through overland trails. Komori concluded that his force was serving no purpose, and on 8February informed his superiors that it faced destruction due to <b>supply</b> <b>shortages.</b> They responded by ordering Komori to hold his positions, though his force was awarded two Imperial citations in recognition of its supposed success in defending the airstrip.|$|E
5|$|Another {{issue that}} {{strained}} the UN logistics system {{was the lack}} of a previously drafted resupply plan. Consumption rates differed among the various units {{and as a result of}} a lack of coordination, some UN units faced <b>supply</b> <b>shortages</b> when other units would request more material than they actually needed. In order to rectify this situation UN logisticians were forced to hastily create a plan as the need arose.|$|E

5|$|But for the Axis, the interdiction {{campaign}} from Malta caused chronic <b>supply</b> <b>shortages</b> in Africa. By April 1943, the Allied armies {{had pushed}} the supply-starved Axis {{forces to the}} northern tip of Tunisia, near its capital Tunis. Despite the desperate situation, the OKW continued to send in significant reinforcement and supply tonnage to the besieged Axis forces by air. To prevent prolonged resistance, the Allies, now aware of the German supply timetables through the use of British Ultra, launched an aerial offensive to destroy this link. It was due to begin in the last week of March 1943, but bad weather over Tunisia meant that it could not begin until 5 April.|$|E
5|$|North Korean troops, {{hampered}} by <b>supply</b> <b>shortages</b> and massive losses, continually staged attacks on UN forces {{in an attempt}} to penetrate the perimeter and collapse the line. However, the UN used the port to amass an overwhelming advantage in troops, equipment, and logistics, and its navy and air forces remained unchallenged by the North Koreans during the fight. After six weeks, the North Korean force collapsed and retreated in defeat after the UN force launched a counterattack at Inchon on September 15. The battle would be the furthest the North Korean troops would advance in the war, as subsequent fighting ground the war into a stalemate.|$|E
5|$|The Dardanelles Commission, {{including}} Fisher, interviewed {{witnesses in}} 1916 and 1917 and issued its final report in 1919. It {{concluded that the}} expedition was poorly planned and executed and that difficulties had been underestimated, problems which were exacerbated by <b>supply</b> <b>shortages</b> and by personality clashes and procrastination at high levels. Some 480,000 Allied troops had been dedicated to the failed campaign, with around half in casualties. The report's conclusions were regarded as insipid with no figures (political or military) heavily censured. The report of the Commission and information gathered by the inquiry remain a key source of documents on the campaign.|$|E

40|$|Diesel is an {{essential}} factor in industrial production and development, and thus its stable supply is a crucial element for economic growth. The <b>supply</b> <b>shortage</b> of diesel has massive economic costs, namely <b>supply</b> <b>shortage</b> costs. This paper attempts to apply input-output (I-O) analysis to measuring the <b>supply</b> <b>shortage</b> cost of industrial diesel in Korea by finding an optimal way of allocating the limited diesel resources to different sectors according to the objective of maximizing overall value-added. To this end, a static I-O framework is presented using a recently published I-O table. The {{results indicate that the}} marginal cost of unsupplied diesel ranges from KRW 716 (USD 0. 65) to KRW 113, 376 (USD 103. 07) per liter and these costs depend not only on the shortage rate of each non-diesel sector but also on the level of its own final demand. The quantitative results are useful for policy-makers to set economic reliability standards, develop optimum curtailment levels and priorities, and plan curtailment strategies for diesel supply and demand...|$|R
5|$|With {{the partial}} {{destruction}} of the North Vietnamese logistical system in Cambodia, the U.S. headquarters in Saigon determined that the time was propitious for a similar campaign in Laos. If such an operation were to be carried out, the U.S. command believed, {{it would be best}} to do it quickly, while American military assets were still available in South Vietnam. Such an operation would create <b>supply</b> <b>shortages</b> that would be felt by PAVN/NLF forces 12–18 months later, as the last U.S. troops were leaving South Vietnam and thereby give the U.S. and its ally a respite from a possible communist offensive in the northern provinces for one year, possibly even two.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the storm, more than 1,000 Electricity Supply Board (ESB) {{personnel}} were deployed to restore power. In some areas, locals worked together to provide others with fresh food after electricity was lost. Fire brigades were sent on patrol to quell any looting. In Galway, ESB repair crews worked through labor and <b>supply</b> <b>shortages</b> to restore power and telephone service despite recent strikes in the company. By September 23, officials in the city appealed to the Government for funding to deal with the aftermath of the hurricane. Uncertainty over whether some of the cost could be footed by landowners themselves resulted in disagreement over how much aid to request. Due to the severity of damage to the electrical grid, there were numerous requests made to the ESB to build underground power cables, especially in Galway.|$|E
5|$|Alma caused {{significant}} {{crop damage}} in western Cuba; it destroyed 13,400acres (5,400hectares) of bananas and 18,090acres (7,320hectares) of corn fields. There were also heavy losses to fruit trees {{and to the}} sugar industry, after the storm destroyed sugar mills and the rail lines that carried the cane to the mills. The storm destroyed over 100tobacco drying barns, including their contents. The destruction of the tobacco represented a $30million loss for the country. High winds also destroyed 96tobacco storage facilities, although the tobacco was removed beforehand. In Güines near Havana, Alma destroyed food crops, which further exacerbated Cuba's existing food shortages. Alma's passage also resulted in water shortages, prompting the government to urge residents to use less water. There was heavy structural damage across western Cuba, including in Havana, Matanzas, Camagüey, Pinar del Río, and Las Villas. The hurricane destroyed 1,083houses, and overall damage was estimated at $200million. Alma killed 12people {{in the country and}} injured 78others. In the storm's aftermath, Cuban officials sent about 100,000people from Havana to the cities around the capital to repair storm damage. Such forced labor was a complaint about the rule of Fidel Castro, after the food and <b>supply</b> <b>shortages.</b>|$|E

40|$|Since the Reform and Opening-up in 1978, China has {{experienced}} a huge sustainable growth {{of gross domestic product}} (GDP) and an incredible development in Information and Communication Technology (ICT). This study aims to utilize an input-output (I-O) approach to explore the role of ICT in Chinese national economy. Specifically, we employ a static I-O framework, and analyze three topics in its application: the inter-industry linkage effect, the production inducing effect, and the <b>supply</b> <b>shortage</b> effect. We pay particular attention to the ICT manufacturing sector and ICT service-providing sector by taking the sectors as exogenous and investigating their economic impacts, respectively. The results suggest that (1) the ICT manufacturing sector has a high backward linkage effect, an intermediate forward linkage effect, a relatively low production inducing effect, and a low <b>supply</b> <b>shortage</b> effect, it suggests that ICT manufacturing sector has a powerful capacity for pulling the production activities of the whole economy. (2) The inter-industry linkage effect and <b>supply</b> <b>shortage</b> effect of ICT service-providing is low, but the production inducing effect of ICT service-providing is high, which suggests that the impact of an increase in ICT service-providing investment on the total output of all other sectors is large...|$|R
5|$|In early September 1940, the Italian 10th Army {{based in}} Libya {{conducted}} the Italian invasion of Egypt {{and three months}} later, the British and Commonwealth troops of the Western Desert Force began a counter-offensive, codenamed Operation Compass. In two months, the British advanced , occupying the Italian province of Cyrenaica and destroying the 10th Army. The advance was halted in February 1941 because of <b>supply</b> <b>shortages</b> and to give priority to the Battle of Greece. Renamed XIII Corps and reorganised under HQ Cyrenaica Command (CYRCOM), the troops of the former Western Desert Force adopted a defensive posture. Over the next few months, HQ Cyrenaica lost its commander, Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson, followed by the 2nd New Zealand Division and the 6th Australian Division when they were sent to Greece in Operation Lustre. The 7th Armoured Division, with virtually no serviceable tanks left, was also withdrawn {{and sent to the}} Nile Delta for rest and refitting. Wilson was replaced by Lieutenant-General Philip Neame; parts of the 2nd Armoured Division and 9th Australian Division were deployed to Cyrenaica but both formations were inexperienced, ill-equipped {{and in the case of}} the 2nd Armoured Division, well under strength, after detachments to Greece.|$|E
5|$|In mid-September Bostock {{gained the}} {{agreement}} of Kenney's headquarters to deploy No.80 Wing to the recently captured island of Morotai in the NEI {{as part of a}} redeployment of RAAF units in the SWPA. While this raised morale within No.80 Wing, it had only a short time to prepare to move overseas. On 8November Caldwell received orders to begin the movement to Morotai as soon as possible, and he visited the island late that month. During this visit he observed that it was likely that <b>supply</b> <b>shortages</b> would impede the wing's operations. No.80 Wing's headquarters left Darwin on 9December and No.452 Squadron departed on 15December. During the squadron's trip to Morotai three Spitfires were destroyed or damaged as a result of landing accidents at Merauke, New Guinea on 15December. As expected, living facilities at Morotai were initially very basic, and Caldwell traded liquor for the services of US engineer units to improve the wing's camp site.|$|E
5|$|The VOC had {{professional}} soldiers of its own. Each VOC soldier had a sword, small arms, cartridges, carrying pouches and belts, smoke bombs, and grenades. The majority of VOC regulars were Indonesians, {{with a small}} number of European soldiers and marines, all under the command of European officers. While in the technological sense VOC troops were not superior to their indigenous counterparts, they generally had better training, discipline, and equipment than indigenous Indonesian armies. The VOC troops also differed with regard to logistics: its troops marched in step followed by a long caravan of carts carrying supplies. This gave them an advantage over Javanese troops, who often lived off the land and frequently faced <b>supply</b> <b>shortages.</b> VOC forces numbered 1,500 in 1676, but they were later augmented by Bugis allies under the leadership of Arung Palakka. The first contingent of 1,500 Bugis arrived in Java in late 1678, and by 1679 there were 6,000 Bugis troops on Java.|$|E

5|$|By {{the spring}} of 1794, the French Republic, {{under the rule of}} the National Convention, was at war with all its neighbours. With famine imminent, the French Committee of Public Safety looked to France's colonies and the United States to provide an {{infusion}} of grain; this was to be convoyed across the Atlantic during April, May and June, accompanied by a small escort squadron and supported by a second, larger squadron in the Bay of Biscay. However, political upheaval had severely reduced the French Navy's ability to fight coherently and <b>supply</b> <b>shortages</b> had devastated its morale, significantly weakening the fleet. Britain, by contrast, was at a high state of readiness with a well-organised command structure, but was suffering from a severe shortage of trained seamen with which to man its large navy. The French Atlantic Fleet, under Admiral Villaret de Joyeuse, was tasked with keeping the British Channel Fleet occupied long enough for the convoy to reach France safely. The Channel Fleet, commanded by Lord Howe, knew of the convoy's passage, and dispatched squadrons to protect British commerce while pursuing Villaret himself with {{the main body of the}} Royal Navy's Channel Fleet. For over a week the two battlefleets manoeuvred around one another, Villaret drawing Howe deeper westwards into the Atlantic and away from the convoy. Two partial but inconclusive fleet actions on 28 and 29 May followed, during which Howe seized the weather gage from Villaret, granting him freedom to choose the time and place of his next attack.|$|E
5|$|Larrea {{did not get}} on {{well with}} Brown, who blamed him for {{disagreements}} and <b>supply</b> <b>shortages,</b> and even for discontent among the sailors. Buenos Aires {{did not have a}} naval tradition, and therefore most of the people involved in the naval campaign were foreigners. As a result, their commitment to the war was often limited. After the capture of Montevideo, Larrea instructed Brown to report directly to the minister of war, and not correspond with himself. Nevertheless, the disagreements continued. Due to the economic crisis caused by the war, Larrea sold the captured ships, decommissioned the navy and sold off the government's own ships, but the sailors complained that they had not received their wages, their reward for the military victory nor their percentage of the sale of the captured ships. Larrea and White were blamed for this. Larrea resigned {{by the end of the}} year, after signing an order for the creation of an infantry and a cavalry regiment for the Army of the Andes. Larrea blamed White for the unresolved dispute over the sailors' wages, declaring that he had arranged that White would organize the payment of the wages. Alvear resigned in 1815 after the mutiny of Álvarez Thomas, and all the members of his administration were put on trial. Larrea was accused of abuse of power, administrative fraud and stealing from the national treasury. All his properties were confiscated, and he was exiled.|$|E
5|$|On 29 December, {{she left}} {{on her first}} war patrol, {{steaming}} for the Mariana Islands. She arrived {{off the coast of}} Guam at 03:00 on 11 January 1945 and Hashimoto ordered four kaitens launched. The kaitens tentatively claimed a tanker sunk, though it was unable to verify if the ship had actually been struck. The strike had been unsuccessful. She then sped back to Kure and arrived there on 20 January. She remained in port there until March, likely due to <b>supply</b> <b>shortages.</b> On 1 March, she was ordered to Iwo Jima to support the battle taking place there. Once there, I-58 was ordered to launch all of its kaitens without their pilots and immediately return home. She was ordered out again on 2 April sailing to support Japanese forces at the Battle of Okinawa. While there, she was attacked by aircraft 50 times. She never surfaced {{for more than a few}} hours. She limped to Kure on 29 April 1945, the only Japanese submarine to withdraw from the operation. She remained in port because of continued mining conducted by U.S. Army Air Forces, and departed on 16 July on another war patrol. At the time, she was one of only four large submarines left in the Japanese Navy, and her mission was to harass Allied lines of communications.|$|E
