5|$|As they {{continue}} walking, SpongeBob constantly sings {{a song about}} how the Krusty Krab pizza is the best pizza on the sea floor, which annoys Squidward. The two gradually become tired and hungry, so SpongeBob suggests they eat coral like the pioneers. Squidward immediately <b>spits</b> <b>out</b> the coral, disgusted by the taste, and demands SpongeBob hand over the pizza so he can eat it, having finally given up hope on getting back to civilization. SpongeBob refuses and a short chase ensues between the two. Just as Squidward is about to grab the pizza, SpongeBob notices a giant rock that he claims the pioneers drove for miles. Incredulous at this claim, Squidward tries to tell SpongeBob {{to forget about the}} pioneers, saying that there are none left because of their unusual travelling methods. He quickly changes his mind after SpongeBob runs him over with the rock and they drive {{it all the way to}} the customer's house.|$|E
25|$|In {{traveling}} {{across the}} sky, Ra brings {{light to the}} earth, sustaining all things that live there. He reaches {{the peak of his}} strength at noon and then ages and weakens as he moves toward sunset. In the evening, Ra takes the form of Atum, the creator god, oldest of all things in the world. According to early Egyptian texts, {{at the end of the}} day he <b>spits</b> <b>out</b> all the other deities, whom he devoured at sunrise. Here they represent the stars, and the story explains why the stars are visible at night and seemingly absent during the day.|$|E
25|$|During the Monsters Unleashed storyline, Fin Fang Foom, Gorgilla, Green Thing, and Zzutak confront Kei Kawade in {{the forest}} outside his house where they caught him offguard. Fin Fang Foom {{was the one who}} warned Kei Kawade against the {{preceding}} monster summoning. Fin Fang Foom was later seen falling from the sky alongside the other monsters. This was because Fin Fang Foom and the other monsters had been summoned by Kei Kawade to help the superheroes fight the Leviathons. He was told by Tim Boo Ba that he and the other monsters are not fighting of their own volition. Kei Kawade later sends Fin Fang Foom to assist the Heroes for Hire against the Leviathons in Hell's Kitchen. When the Leviathon Mother shows up and calls out to Kei Kawade, Fin Fang Foom shows up to challenge her. When Kei Kawade confronts the Leviathon Mother and gets her attention, she <b>spits</b> <b>out</b> Fin Fang Foom. Following the Leviathon Mother's death, Fin Fang Foom and the other Goliathons confront him. Even though Kei Kawade thanks the Goliathons for their help in fending off the Leviathons, Fin Fang Foom is the one that warns him about summoning them again before the Goliathons are teleported away.|$|E

500|$|A {{review of}} several albums by Redding in Rolling Stone {{magazine}} observed that [...] "he title track on [...] set {{the pattern for}} all his ballads to come—Otis triumphed at rendering agony. Signs of the singer's virtuosity are already apparent in the almost teasing way he lingers over some lyrics and <b>spits</b> <b>out</b> others; virtually never would he sing a line the same way twice". The review gave the album 4 out of 5 stars.|$|E

[...] That not being {{the object of}} the game, Resnick explains the [...] "Q*bert was a lover, not a fighter."

500|$|In the DVD {{commentary}} {{for this}} episode, director Brian Grant and actor Bruno Langley refer to an additional motivation for Adam's actions. Apparently, in earlier drafts of the script, Adam's father {{suffered from a}} disease that was incurable in his time (2012) and he hoped to learn about a cure which had been discovered between that year and 200,000. In the shooting script, the condition is arthritis. No trace of this motivation remains in the finished programme, although Grant discusses {{it as if it}} were still present. Langley and Grant also reveal that the [...] "frozen vomit" [...] that Adam <b>spits</b> <b>out</b> in one scene was in fact a [...] "kiwi and orange ice cube".|$|E

500|$|Smith's 11th studio album, Banga, was {{released}} in [...] June 2012. Music Journalist Hal Horowitz wrote : [...] "These songs aren't as loud or frantic as those of her late 70s heyday, but they resonate just as boldly as she moans, chants, speaks and <b>spits</b> <b>out</b> lyrics with the grace and determination of Mohammad Ali in his prime. It's not an easy listen—the vast majority of her music never has been—but if you're a fan and/or prepared for the challenge, this is as potent, heady and uncompromising as she has ever gotten, and with Smith's storied history as a musical maverick, that's saying plenty." [...] The critical aggregator website Metacritic awarded the album a score of 81, indicating [...] "universal acclaim".|$|E
500|$|Cher has a contralto singing voice, {{described}} by author Nicholas E. Tawa as [...] "bold, deep, {{and with a}} spacious vibrato". Ann Powers of The New York Times called it [...] "a quintessential rock voice: impure, quirky, a fine vehicle for projecting personality." [...] AllMusic's Bruce Eder wrote that the [...] "tremendous intensity and passion" [...] of Cher's vocals coupled with her [...] "ability to meld that projection with her acting skills" [...] can provide [...] "an incredibly powerful experience for the listener", despite her having a limited vocal range. Paul Simpson, in his book The Rough Guide to Cult Pop (2003), posits that [...] "Cher [...] the possessor {{of one of the}} huskiest, most distinctive voices in pop... which can work wonders with the right material directed by the right producer". He further addresses the believability of her vocal performances: [...] "she <b>spits</b> <b>out</b> the words... with such conviction you'd think she was delivering an eternal truth about the human condition".|$|E
500|$|Patrick MacDonald of The Seattle Times called [...] "Scream" [...] {{the best}} {{song on the}} album. He continued, [...] "The refrain of [...] "Stop pressurin' me!" [...] is compelling, and he <b>spits</b> <b>out</b> the lyrics with drama and purpose. The song has bite and {{infectious}} energy." [...] MacDonald did, however, consider the use of profanity unnecessary. Deepika Reddy of The Daily Collegian wrote, [...] "The lyrics to the album's debut single and video 'Scream' are {{for the first time}} in Jackson's convoluted career, painfully direct. He sings 'Stop pressuring me/Stop pressuring me/It makes me want to scream' with a force and resentment that's new and surpassing." [...] "'Scream' and 'Tabloid Junkie' have a raw aspect that Jackson hasn't approached since a near-miss with 'Billie Jean.'" [...] Richard Harrington of The Washington Post, however, called it [...] "dull and musically uninvolved." [...] He was also of the opinion that it sounded like [...] "Jam" [...] from 1991, thus dated. [...] "Scream" [...] was nominated for [...] "Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals" [...] at the 1996 American Music Awards, and shortly afterward it gained a Grammy nomination for [...] "Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals." ...|$|E

2500|$|In cross promotion, Godzilla {{appeared}} in a light-hearted commercial for the Snickers chocolate bar, playing ping pong and water skiing. The angry Godzilla is calmed by eating a Snickers bar. Godzilla is portrayed as both human-sized and much larger. Another cross-promotion commercial was made, featuring Godzilla in a Fiat 500L car commercial. In it, Godzilla is rampaging through a city, devouring Fiat cars as he goes, with a soldier claiming that he was [...] "craving Italian." [...] He then approaches to devour a Fiat 500L, {{but because of the}} car's size being larger than a 500 model, Godzilla cannot swallow it. Nearly choking on it, he <b>spits</b> <b>out</b> the car as it drives away.|$|E
2500|$|Krill {{are thought}} to undergo between one and three {{vertical}} migrations from mixed surface waters to depth each day. The krill is a very untidy feeder, and it often <b>spits</b> <b>out</b> aggregates of phytoplankton (spit balls) containing thousands of cells sticking together. It also produces fecal strings that still contain significant amounts of carbon and the glass shells of the diatoms. Both are heavy and sink very fast into the abyss. This process is called the biological pump. As the waters around Antarctica are very deep (...) , they act as a carbon dioxide sink: this process exports large quantities of carbon (fixed carbon dioxide, CO2) from the biosphere and sequesters it for about 1,000years.|$|E
2500|$|A dinosaur materialises in Victorian London and <b>spits</b> <b>out</b> the TARDIS {{onto the}} banks of the river Thames, from which emerges the newly {{regenerated}} Twelfth Doctorsuffering from post-regenerative traumaand Clara Oswald. They are greeted by the Paternoster Gang, consisting of Silurian Madame Vastra, her human maid and wife Jenny, and Sontaran butler Strax. Vastra instructs the police on how to calm and contain the dinosaur and takes the Doctor and Clara to their residence. [...] While the Doctor rests, Vastra confronts Clara about her prejudiced attitude to the Doctor's changed face. Clara admits that she is struggling to adapt to the new Doctor, due to his stark difference to the old one, particularly his apparent age. The Doctor awakens to hear the dinosaur's pleas for help. [...] He leaves his room and, gambolling along London's rooftops, he calls out to assure the creature that he will return it to its proper time, just before it bursts into flames. Stealing a horse to reach the dinosaur, the Doctor then joins Clara and the Paternoster Gang, who have followed him to the river, and learns from Vastra {{that this is not the}} first recent incident of spontaneous combustion. The Doctor spots an unfazed man across the river and jumps into the water to investigate. Clara returns home with the others to start their own investigations, hoping they will cross the Doctor's path.|$|E

2500|$|Mr. Cheong, {{considers}} {{his wife}} to be [...] "completely unremarkable in any way". He explains that when he first met her, he was not even attracted to her and that suits him just fine. Mr. Cheong is content meandering through life; {{it seems as if}} his only goal is to live a conventional, unremarkable life. He chooses to marry his wife since he thinks she would prove to be a good, dutiful wife who would fit nicely into the kind of lifestyle he seeks. [...] After several years of relatively normal marriage, Mr. Cheong wakes up to find his wife disposing of all meat products in the house. He demands an explanation, and Yeong-hye replies vaguely that [...] "I had a dream." [...] Mr. Cheong attempts to rationalize his wife's life decision {{over the next few months}} and to deal with vegetarian meals at home, but eventually calls Yeong-hye's family and an intervention is scheduled. While around the dinner table, Yeong-hye's family attempts to convince her to eat meat; her father, who served in Vietnam and is known for his stern temperament, slaps her when she refuses. Her father then asks a reluctant Mr. Cheong and Yeong-hye's brother Yeong-ho to hold her arms while he force-feeds her a piece of pork. Yeong-hye breaks away, <b>spits</b> <b>out</b> the pork, grabs a fruit knife, and slits her wrist. The incredulous family rushes her to a hospital where she recovers and where Mr. Cheong admits to himself that she has become mentally unstable. As the section ends Yeong-hye manages to walk out of the hospital and when she is tracked down, she reveals a bird in her palm, which has a [...] "predator's bite" [...] in it, and she asks [...] "Have I done something wrong?" ...|$|E
