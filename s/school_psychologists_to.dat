School climate is {{consistently}} identified by researchers as a variable that is related to effectiveness of schools. [...] Specifically, positive school climate is associated with several student outcomes including achievement, attendance, self-concept, and behavior. Therefore, school psychologists seek to improve school climate as a school-wide preventative approach rather than a reactive or remedial approach. [...] Best practice proposes that school climate is first described and measured before a plan of action is developed and implemented. While efforts to improve school climate can be implemented at the national level with large-scale reform, or on a smaller scale at the individual school or district level, the strategies used to improve school climate need to be based on the individual strengths and weaknesses of each school. School psychologists can play an integral part in promoting positive school climate within their schools and districts.

In these cases grief may be hidden. Four categories of disenfranchised grievers (disenfranchised relationships, disenfranchised losses, unrecognized or disenfranchised grievers, death not socially sanctioned) are discussed.
