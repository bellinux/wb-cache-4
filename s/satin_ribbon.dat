60|$|Grandmarina gave a {{magnificent}} wedding-feast afterwards, {{in which there}} was everything and more to eat, and everything and more to drink. The wedding-cake was delicately ornamented with white <b>satin</b> <b>ribbons,</b> frosted silver, and white lilies, and was forty-two yards round.|$|R
50|$|Double-faced fabrics are a form {{of double}} cloth made of one warp and two sets of wefts, or (less often) two warps and one weft. These fabrics have two right sides or faces and no wrong side, and include most blankets, <b>satin</b> <b>ribbons,</b> and interlinings.|$|R
60|$|Teresa’s {{heart beat}} high. Could he be the Honourable Augustus Fitz-Edward Fitz-John Fitz-Osborne! What {{a name to}} be elegantly {{engraved}} upon two glazed cards, tied together {{with a piece of}} white <b>satin</b> <b>ribbon!</b> ‘The Honourable Mrs. Augustus Fitz-Edward Fitz-John Fitz-Osborne!’ The thought was transport.|$|E
6000|$|The {{putting on}} of the pearl-set ring was mere ceremonial, of course; {{she could not}} wear it either at Lagune's or at home, so instead she {{threaded}} it on a little white <b>satin</b> <b>ribbon</b> and wore it round her neck--"next her heart." [...] He thought of it there warm [...] "next her heart." ...|$|E
60|$|Be {{that as it}} may, {{there is}} no doubt that a certain wave of {{electrical}} excitement swept over the little crowd assembled there, the while the chief actor in the little drama, the inimitable dandy, Sir Percy Blakeney himself, appeared deeply engrossed in removing a speck of powder from the wide black <b>satin</b> <b>ribbon</b> which held his gold-rimmed eyeglass.|$|E
50|$|The {{patterns}} and stereotomies {{produced by the}} recurring <b>satin</b> <b>ribbons</b> are one of Cristina’s trademarks. However, with reference to narratives and artefacts that are familiar to her daily life, Cristina essentially uses popular materials, which relate to a woman’s condition and draws on crafting techniques usually associated to domestic crafts.|$|R
50|$|Award ribbons can {{be simply}} a flat piece of ribbon, a flat-folded ribbon, or fancier {{manipulations}} of the ribbon material, such as rosettes. A rosette consists of ribbon that is pleated or gathered and {{arranged in a}} circle so that it resembles a rose, usually with streamer ribbons attached. Some ribbon rosettes will also have loops, petals and star points {{as part of the}} design whilst using <b>Satin</b> <b>ribbons,</b> Velvet ribbons, Sheer ribbons, Lamé ribbons, Tartan ribbons and printed ribbons including personalised printed ribbons to promote the sponsor, event or the reason for giving.|$|R
50|$|Her art {{celebrates the}} role of women in {{contemporary}} society. Items which are characteristic of the female universe are used in her works of art. Cotton lace, <b>satin</b> <b>ribbons,</b> glass and crystal necklaces are combined with iron and musical instruments in order to build narratives. Ready-made necklaces bought in the pound shop are combined with luxurious china, in an eclectic blend creating an analogy with contemporary society.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear me!' cried Katherine, 'I {{wonder if}} it will. What {{is to be done}} if that {{tiresome}} Miss Dighten does not send home our dresses in time? We must go and hurry her to-morrow. And I must get Mamma to go to Baysmouth this week to get our ribbons. I looked over all Mr. Green's on Monday, and he has not one bit of pink <b>satin</b> <b>ribbon</b> wide enough, or fit to be seen.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "His {{courtship}} {{had lasted}} some time--ever since {{he got his}} precarious footing in the community. It began by his buying for Amy Foster a green <b>satin</b> <b>ribbon</b> in Darnford. This was what you did in his country. You bought a ribbon at a Jew's stall on a fair-day. I don't suppose the girl {{knew what to do}} with it, but he seemed to think that his honourable intentions could not be mistaken.|$|E
60|$|There {{seemed at}} first to be nothing on it, and then {{there seemed to be}} {{something}} in the further corner, which when it was tiptoed for, proved to be a bouquet of flowers, not so faded as to seem very old; the blue <b>satin</b> <b>ribbon</b> which they were tied up with, and which hung down half a yard, was of entire freshness except far the dust of the shelf where it had lain.|$|E
50|$|Manchester, the old textile {{capital of}} Europe, became her chosen home {{for seven years}} and during this time Cristina focused {{on the study of}} Contemporary Art. By {{combining}} her many interests, namely culture, oral traditions and textiles, she created The Blanket, one of her most emblematic works. The original version of this contemporary art installation was made with Idanha-a-Nova’s traditional instrument, the adufe, cotton lace and <b>satin</b> <b>ribbons.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2011 Cristina {{was awarded}} a {{research}} grant by the Arts and Humanities Research Council to develop her ongoing research project ‘Design for Desertification’. She then focused her research work on the study and register of Portuguese territories with low population density. She also began to create some of her most poignant contemporary art work, and textiles became her trade mark from the outset. The recurring use of <b>satin</b> <b>ribbons,</b> industrial fabrics and lace has been a distinguishing feature in her aesthetic narrative.|$|R
50|$|The New York Times {{reported}} Bostwick's {{wedding to}} Laura Elizabeth Curtis on 7 October 1933, and their divorce about 16 years later. At the wedding, at Roslyn, Long Island, NY, the rector of the Parish Church presided. The bride {{wore a white}} satin gown cut in simple lines, with a long train. Her veil fell {{to the end of}} the train from a cap held in place by small white orchids. Her bouquet was of white orchids with pendant buds on <b>satin</b> <b>ribbons.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I said 'Yes, Joe,' and then--well, {{never mind}} that bit;--we were married in June, and I spun and wove my wedding things afterward. Dreadful slack, my mother thought, but I didn't care. My wedding gown was white lutestring, full trimmed with old lace. Hair over a cushion with white roses, and the pearl necklace, just as you see up there. Joe wore his uniform, and I tied up his hair with a white <b>satin</b> <b>ribbon.</b> He looked beautiful,--and so did I." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] said John, triumphantly {{drawing out}} his pocket-book, and {{producing}} thence {{a knot of}} rose-colored <b>satin</b> <b>ribbon.</b> [...] "Did you ever see such a lovely color as this? It's so exquisite, you see! Well, she always is wearing just such knots of ribbon, the most lovely shades. Why, there isn't one woman in a thousand could wear the things she does. Every thing becomes her. Sometimes it's rose color, or lilac, or pale blue,--just the most trying things to others are what she can wear." ...|$|E
60|$|I think {{almost any}} lady, {{who knows the}} magical value of bits of trimming, and bows of ribbon judiciously {{adjusted}} in critical locations, of inserting, edging, and embroidery, considered as economic arts, must acknowledge {{that there is some}} force in the young lady's opinion. Nevertheless the Doric simplicity of a Quaker lady's dress, who is in circumstances to choose her material, has a peculiar charm. As at present advised, the Quaker ladies whom I have seen very judiciously adhere to the spirit of plain attire, without troubling themselves to maintain the exact letter. For instance, a plain straw cottage, with its white <b>satin</b> <b>ribbon,</b> is sometimes allowed {{to take the place of}} the close silk bonnet of Fox's day.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{the asphalt}} tennis court small tables for {{afternoon}} tea were set, each table {{enhanced by the}} addition of its vase of flowers and the whole was presided over by a bevy of pretty girls in white frocks and black picture hats their distinguishing colours being huge bows of pale blue <b>satin</b> <b>ribbons</b> placed on the corsage. Down the hill towards the Rose Bay Road some dozen marquees were erected and these were furnished with gaily-draped stalls laden with the most attractive articles tempting to the would-be purchaser.|$|R
60|$|There {{seemed to}} be an unnatural stillness everywhere, amid which the {{crunching}} of the dry snow sounded with a distinctness that almost frightened the boy, who was simply going to his uncle Robert's to spend a day or two. But finally Dan was on the main road, where the snow was frozen so hard that his footsteps could not be heard as distinctly, and where the two tracks worn smooth by the runners of the sleighs lay spread out before him, looking like two <b>satin</b> <b>ribbons</b> on white broadcloth.|$|R

60|$|Standing behind her, he devoured {{her with}} his eyes, from the golden crown of her rigidly {{motionless}} head to the heels of her shoes, the line of her shapely shoulders, the curves of her fine figure swaying a little before the keyboard. She had on a light dress; the sleeves stopped short at the elbows in an edging of lace. A <b>satin</b> <b>ribbon</b> encircled her waist. In an access of irresistible, reckless hopefulness he clapped both his hands on that waist--and then the irritating music stopped at last. But, quick as she was in springing away from the contact (the round music-stool going over with a crash), Heemskirk's lips, aiming at her neck, landed a hungry, smacking kiss just under her ear. A deep silence reigned for a time. And then he laughed rather feebly.|$|E
60|$|To his surprise, {{however, the}} young girl, {{following}} {{the path to}} the lilacs, began leisurely to ascend the hill, swaying from side to side with a youthful movement, and swinging the long stalk of a lily at her side. In another moment he would be discovered! Dick was frightened; his confidence of the moment before had all gone; he would fly,--and yet, an exquisite and fearful joy kept him motionless. She was approaching him, full and clear in the moonlight. He could see the grace of her delicate figure in the simple white frock drawn at the waist with broad <b>satin</b> <b>ribbon,</b> and its love-knots of pale blue ribbons on her shoulders; he could see the coils of her brown hair, the pale, olive tint of her oval cheek, the delicate, swelling nostril of her straight, clear-cut nose; he could even smell the lily she carried in her little hand. Then, suddenly, she lifted her long lashes, and her large gray eyes met his.|$|E
6000|$|As a picturesquely and {{persistently}} interesting personage, {{there is}} no mate to Mrs. Eddy, the accepted Equal of the Saviour. But some of her tastes are so different from His! I find it quite impossible to imagine Him, in life, standing sponsor for that museum there, and taking pleasure in its sumptuous shows. I believe He would put that Chair in the fire, and the bell along with it; and I think He would make the show-woman go away. I think He would break those electric bulbs, and the [...] "mantel-piece of pure onyx," [...] and say reproachful things about the golden drain-pipes of the lavatory, and give the costly rug of duck-breasts to the poor, and sever the <b>satin</b> <b>ribbon</b> and invite the weary to rest and ease their aches in the consecrated chairs. What He would do with the painted windows we can better conjecture when we come presently to examine their peculiarities.|$|E

6000|$|By {{the time}} that it wanted only three minutes to noon, the droll object in {{question}} was perceived to be a very diminutive foreign-looking young man. He descended the hills at a great rate, so that every body had soon a good look at him. He was really the most finicky little personage that had ever been seen in Vondervotteimittiss. His countenance was of a dark snuff-color, and he had a long hooked nose, pea eyes, a wide mouth, and an excellent set of teeth, which latter he seemed anxious of displaying, as he was grinning from ear to ear. What with mustachios and whiskers, there was none of the rest of his face to be seen. His head was uncovered, and his hair neatly done up in papillotes. His dress was a tight-fitting swallow-tailed black coat (from one of whose pockets dangled a vast length of white handkerchief), black kerseymere knee-breeches, black stockings, and stumpy-looking pumps, with huge bunches of black <b>satin</b> <b>ribbon</b> for bows. Under one arm he carried a huge chapeau-de-bras, and under the other a fiddle nearly five times as big as himself. In his left hand was a gold snuff-box, from which, as he capered down the hill, cutting all manner of fantastic steps, he took snuff incessantly with an air of the greatest possible self-satisfaction. God bless me!--here was a sight for the honest burghers of Vondervotteimittiss! ...|$|E
60|$|In {{expectation}} of the curate's visit, Mrs Clinton tidied {{the house and}} adorned herself. It {{has been said that}} she was a woman of taste, and so she was. The mantelpiece and looking glass were artistically draped with green muslin, and this she proceeded to arrange, tying and carefully forming the yellow <b>satin</b> <b>ribbon</b> with which it was relieved. The chairs were covered with cretonne which might have come from the Tottenham Court Road, and these she placed in positions of careless and artistic confusion, smoothing down the antimacassars which were now her pride, as the silk petticoat from which she had manufactured them had been once her glory. For the flower-pots she made fresh coverings of red tissue paper, re-arranged the ornaments gracefully scattered about on little Japanese tables; then, after pausing a moment to admire her work and see that nothing had been left undone, she went upstairs to perform her own toilet.... In less than half an hour she reappeared, holding herself in a dignified posture, with her head slightly turned to one side and her hands meekly folded in front of her, stately and collected as Juno, a goddess in black satin. Her dress was very elegant; it might have typified her own life, for in its original state of virgin whiteness it had been her wedding garment; then it was dyed purple, and might have betokened a sense of change and coming responsibilities; lastly it was black, to signify the burden of a family, and the seriousness of life. No one had realised so intensely as Mrs Clinton the truth of the poet's words. Life is not an empty dream. She took out her handkerchief, redolent with lascivious patchouli, and placed it in her bosom--a spot of whiteness against the black.... She sat herself down to wait.|$|E
6000|$|... "We lately {{stood on}} the {{threshold}} of the Holy of Holies of the Mother-Church, and with a crowd of worshippers patiently waited for admittance to the hallowed precincts of the 'Mother's Room.' Over the doorway was a sign informing us that but four persons at a time would be admitted; that they would be permitted to remain but five minutes only, and would please retire from the 'Mother's Room' at the ringing of the bell. Entering with three of the faithful, we looked with profane eyes upon the consecrated furnishings. A show-woman in attendance monotonously announced the character of the different appointments. Set in a recess of the wall and illumined with electric light was an oil-painting the show-woman seriously declared to be a lifelike and realistic picture of the Chair in which the Mother sat when she composed her 'inspired' work. It was a picture of an old-fashioned? country, hair cloth rocking-chair, and an exceedingly commonplace-looking table with a pile of manuscript, an ink-bottle, and pen conspicuously upon it. On the floor were sheets of manuscript. 'The mantel-piece is of pure onyx,' continued the show-woman, 'and the beehive upon the window-sill is made from one solid block of onyx; the rug is made of a hundred breasts of eider-down ducks, and the toilet-room you see in the corner is of the latest design, with gold-plated drain-pipes; the painted windows are from the Mother's poem, [...] "Christ and Christmas," [...] and that case contains complete copies of all the Mother's books.' The chairs upon which the sacred person of the Mother had reposed were protected from sacrilegious touch by a broad band of <b>satin</b> <b>ribbon.</b> My companions expressed their admiration in subdued and reverent tones, and at the tinkling of the bell we reverently tiptoed out of the room to admit another delegation of the patient waiters at the door." ...|$|E
6000|$|First came a {{magnificent}} golden chariot, drawn {{by a great}} Lion and an immense Tiger, who stood shoulder to shoulder and trotted along as gracefully as a well-matched team of thoroughbred horses. And standing upright within the chariot was a beautiful girl clothed in flowing robes of silver gauze and wearing a jeweled diadem upon her dainty head. She held in one hand the <b>satin</b> <b>ribbons</b> that guided her astonishing team, {{and in the other}} an ivory wand that separated at the top into two prongs, the prongs being tipped by the letters [...] "O" [...] and [...] "Z", made of glistening diamonds set closely together.|$|R
5000|$|Since 1545 the Lord Mayor of London {{has worn}} a Royal Livery Collar of Esses. However, the collar's origins are not royal, Sir John Alleyn, thrice Lord Mayor, having bequeathed {{it to the}} next Lord Mayor and his successors [...] "to use and occupie yerely at and uppon principall and festivall dayes." [...] It was {{enlarged}} in 1567, and in its present shape has 28 Esses (the Lancastrian ‘S’), Tudor roses and the tasselled knots of the Garter (alternating) and also the Portcullis, from which hangs the Mayoral Jewel. The collar is worn over whatever the Lord Mayor may be wearing, secured onto their underdress or State Robes by means of black or white silk <b>satin</b> <b>ribbons</b> on the shoulders.|$|R
6000|$|That {{night the}} boys planned their first {{job on the}} Rube. We had ordered a special Pullman for travel to Toronto, and when I got to the depot in the morning, the Pullman was a white {{fluttering}} mass of <b>satin</b> <b>ribbons.</b> Also, there was a brass band, and thousands of baseball fans, and barrels of old foot-gear. The Rube and Nan arrived in a cab and were immediately mobbed. The crowd roared, the band played, the engine whistled, the bell clanged; {{and the air was}} full of confetti and slippers, and showers of rice like hail pattered everywhere. A somewhat dishevelled bride and groom boarded the Pullman and breathlessly hid in a state room. The train started, and the crowd gave one last rousing cheer.
