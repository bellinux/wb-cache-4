The purpose of this project is to design and develop a <b>brake</b> <b>control</b> system using a Programmable Logic Control, (PLC) and implement it into <b>brake</b> <b>control</b> system nowadays. This brake system is using OMRON CQM 1 H programmable controllers as controller, MITSUBISHI FR-S 500 inverter as a converter to convert DC source from PLC to AC source for AC motor and DC voltage power supply as a sensor. This <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> system will detect any obstacle {{in front of the}} vehicle and reducing the AC motor rotation depends on the distance of the obstacle. This concept is almost similarly to nowadays <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> system, Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC). As a result, this <b>brake</b> <b>control</b> system is able to be controlled by varying the voltage regulated based on distance sensor specification. -Autho...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper proposes {{an active}} <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> {{dynamical}} system {{in order to}} establish a safe and efficient vehicle driving stability control test system. Aiming at Chery A 3 sedan, set up the active <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> dynamic simulation system base on MATLAB/Simulink. Adopting the brake driving integration ESP control strategy, analyze and verify the stability control performance of independent vehicle system and vehicle ESP test system based on active <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> respectively in under steering and excessive steering two test conditions. The analyzing results indicate that the test system based on active <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> can effectively assist vehicle travelling in the absence of ESP control or ESP control system failure; when vehicle has ESP control system, the driving stability control performance of this system and independent vehicle system has remarkable consistency. The active <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> system provides a basis for research of vehicle driving stability control test. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{tests the}} {{effectiveness}} of closed-loop <b>brake</b> <b>control</b> to reduce vehicle off-tracking arising from overspeeding in curves. When a driver enters a curve too fast given the available friction, {{the aim is to}} use electronic <b>brake</b> <b>control</b> to reduce speed and increase path curvature to complete the turn. Previously it has been found that coordinated four wheel braking referenced to an inertially fixed vehicle mass center acceleration (PPR) is an optimal control strategy. The present work introduces the effect of driver-vehicle interaction, using simulation and track experiments. It is confirmed that PPR effectiveness is not disrupted by typical steering corrections from the driver. PPR is found to offer significant path following improvements compared with other <b>brake</b> <b>control</b> strategies...|$|R

40|$|A new {{cooperative}} <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> strategy (CBCS) {{is proposed}} for a parallel {{hybrid electric vehicle}} (HEV) with both a regenerative braking system and an antilock braking system (ABS) to achieve improved braking performance and energy regeneration. The braking system of the vehicle {{is based on a}} new method of HEV braking torque distribution that makes the antilock braking system work together with the regenerative braking system harmoniously. In the cooperative <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> strategy, a sliding mode controller (SMC) for ABS is designed to maintain the wheel slip within an optimal range by adjusting the hydraulic braking torque continuously; to reduce the chattering in SMC, a boundary-layer method with moderate tuning of a saturation function is also investigated; based on the wheel slip ratio, battery state of charge (SOC), and the motor speed, a fuzzy logic control strategy (FLC) is applied to adjust the regenerative braking torque dynamically. In order to evaluate the performance of the cooperative <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> strategy, the <b>braking</b> system model of a hybrid electric vehicle is built in MATLAB/SIMULINK. It is found from the simulation that the cooperative <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> strategy suggested in this paper provides satisfactory braking performance, passenger comfort, and high regenerative efficiency...|$|R

40|$|In modern road vehicles, active <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> {{systems are}} crucial {{elements}} {{to ensure safety}} and lateral stability. Unfortunately, the wheel slip dynamics is highly nonlinear and the on-line estimation of the road-tire conditions is still a challenging open research problem. These facts {{make it difficult to}} devise a <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> system that is reliable in any possible situation without being too conservative. In this paper, we propose the Data-Driven Inversion Based Control D 2 -IBC approach to overcome the above issues. The method relies on a two degrees of freedom architecture, with a linear controller and a nonlinear controller in parallel, both designed using only experimental data. The effectiveness of the proposed approach against state-of-the-art <b>braking</b> <b>control</b> is shown by means of an extensive simulation campaign.
