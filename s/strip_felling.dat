50|$|Fisher {{appeared}} {{to lose all}} interest in the strip during the 1930s, and after Mack died in 1932, the job of creating the <b>strip</b> <b>fell</b> to Al Smith. The strip retained Fisher's signature until his death, however, and not until December 7, 1954, was the strip signed by Smith.|$|R
50|$|It is a World War II air base, {{which was}} used by the 317th Airlift Squadron of the US Airforce and was the first base of {{operations}} for the B29 Superfortresses (units of the 58th Bomb Wing). The Air <b>Strip</b> <b>fell</b> out of use after World War II but it is currently has a RADAR station. The nearest Airstrip is at Air Force Station Kalaikunda.|$|R
50|$|Jordan later {{tried to}} revamp the {{character}} by publishing a similar strip called Lance McLane in the Scottish newspaper Daily Record. After this failed to catch on, Jordan {{came up with an}} embarrassing plot hole in which McLane somehow transformed himself into Hawke. However the resuscitated strip never recovered the original brilliance of the Patterson period: Jordan left more and more work to his unnamed helpers, and rapidly the <b>strip</b> <b>fell</b> into oblivion.|$|R
50|$|Born in Brooklyn, New York, Smith was the art {{editor for}} the {{syndication}} department of the New York World from 1920 to 1930. Bud Fisher appeared to lose all interest in his Mutt and Jeff strip during the 1930s, and after his assistant Ed Mack died in 1932, the job of creating the <b>strip</b> <b>fell</b> to Al Smith. The strip retained Fisher's signature until his death, however, and not until December 7, 1954 was the strip signed by Smith.|$|R
50|$|German Würzburg radar was {{susceptible}} to Window attack. The short wavelength allowed {{the use of}} short <b>strips</b> which <b>fell</b> only slowly, giving the cloud a long dispersion time. Würzburg also used conical scanning, which gives a slowly rotating polarisation, {{so that it was}} affected by all of the strips, no matter their orientation.|$|R

6000|$|In {{token of}} his good faith, Mr. Ford turned two of his pockets inside out. A <b>strip</b> of {{cardboard}} <b>fell</b> to the floor from one of them. He recovered it {{and was in the}} act of returning it, when Martin cried:- ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Rick Yager - {{as fast as}} he was talented - {{rendered}} Buck Rogers {{characters in}} a forceful, vital manner, employing heavy, self-assured strokes for his delineations. His drawings virtually breathe. He {{was one of the few}} artists capable of making a transition from the grotesque 'cartoon' style of the late Twenties and early Thirties to the true 'illustration' style popularized by Terry and the Pirates and other strips. Many of Yager's contemporaries developed an overly slick technique that transformed drawings into little more than photographs drained of incipient movement and life. Not Rick." [...] For the last decade of his work on the strip Yager was finally allowed to sign his own name to his work. During this phase of his career Yager also took over the daily Buck Rogers strip - both art and story line; he was assisted by Len Dworkins from 1951-56. At the time Yager left the National Newspaper Syndicate in 1958 due to a dispute over contracts, the circulation of the Buck Rogers daily newspaper strip was at an all-time high. After having been read by millions of people every day for decades, the Buck Rogers <b>strip</b> <b>fell</b> on hard times after Yager's departure. By 1965 the Sunday page was discontinued, and in 1967 the plug was pulled on the daily strip as well which by then was down to a handful of newspapers.|$|R
60|$|We {{saw nothing}} of the wild men of the {{previous}} day, and only once were we menaced {{by any of the}} strange denizens of Caprona, when some frightful nightmare of the sky swooped down upon us, only to be driven off by a fusillade of bullets. The thing appeared to be some variety of pterodactyl, and what with its enormous size and ferocious aspect was most awe-inspiring. There was another incident, too, which to me at least was far more unpleasant than the sudden onslaught of the prehistoric reptile. Two of the men, both Germans, were <b>stripping</b> a <b>felled</b> tree of its branches. Von Schoenvorts had completed his swagger-stick, and he and I were passing close to where the two worked.|$|R
50|$|In 1981, Nintendo was {{pursuing}} {{a license to}} make a game based on the Popeye comic <b>strip.</b> When this <b>fell</b> through, Nintendo decided {{that it would take}} the opportunity to create new characters that could then be marketed and used in later games. Miyamoto came up with many characters and plot concepts, but he eventually settled on a gorilla/carpenter/girlfriend love triangle that mirrored the rivalry between Bluto and Popeye for Olive Oyl.|$|R
5|$|According to the {{official}} investigation conducted by the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la Sécurité de l'Aviation Civile (BEA), the crash {{was caused by a}} metallic <b>strip</b> that <b>fell</b> from a Continental Airlines DC-10 that had taken off minutes earlier. This fragment punctured a tyre on Concorde's left main wheel bogie during take-off. The tyre exploded, and a piece of rubber hit the fuel tank, which caused a fuel leak and led to a fire. The crew shut down engine number 2 in response to a fire warning, and with engine number 1 surging and producing little power, the aircraft was unable to gain altitude or speed. The aircraft entered a rapid pitch-up then a violent descent, rolling left and crashing tail-low into the Hôtelissimo Les Relais Bleus Hotel in Gonesse.|$|R
60|$|A long <b>strip</b> of wood <b>fell</b> to his ax--long {{enough to}} require cutting in two. He turned it, and stooped over it. Something caught his eye--letters {{carved in the}} wood. He looked closer. The letters were very faintly and badly cut. He could only make out the first three of them; and even of those he was not quite certain. They looked like C L A--if they looked like anything. He threw down the strip of wood irritably.|$|R
50|$|In 1986, {{developers}} began {{tearing down}} {{many of the}} small, dilapidated structures along the Strip and started erecting tall, modern office buildings. In the spring of 1987, the city began the largest crackdown on prostitution on the <b>Strip</b> since 1980.Crime <b>fell</b> rapidly. By January 1988, there was 5000000 sq ft of new and renovated office space along 14th Street NW and around Franklin Square, with another 2000000 sq ft of space worth $400 million opening by 1990.|$|R
2500|$|Youth {{have been}} engaged in {{military}} action since before the creation of Israel. In the 1929 Hebron massacre, 67 Jews were killed, young children among them; Arab youths initiated the violence by hurling rocks at Jewish students as they walked by. In 1948, adolescent fighters from the Irgun and Lehi paramilitary groups participated in a massacre of 107 Palestinian residents of the village of Deir Yassin, a number of whom were children. Since the Six-Day War, when the West Bank and the Gaza <b>Strip</b> <b>fell</b> under Israeli military occupation, according to Anton Shammas, the idea of 'childhood' was abolished and dropped from Israeli military declarations, so that if a 10-year-old happened to be shot, he was referred to as 'a young man of ten'. With the outbreak of the first intifada, stone-throwing was defined as a felony, children began to be arrested with bail set at %400, and if this was not paid, they could be held in administrative detention for 1 year. The continued Israeli occupation and the stalled Israeli–Palestinian peace process has led to Palestinian protests and political violence, building up to mass protests during the First Intifada (1987–1993). Many youth were involved in nonviolent demonstrations, sit-ins, walk-outs, boycotts, civil disobedience and strikes organized by popular committees. There also was rioting, grenade throwing, and suicide bombings. J. Kuttab refers to the First Intifada as the [...] "children's revolt" [...] because youth [...] "possessed a new spirit that challenged the occupation" [...] and inspired even adults to action. James L. Gelvin has written that the [...] "paradigmatic symbol" [...] of the First Intifada was [...] "unarmed Palestinian children throwing stones at Israeli tanks." [...] Approximately 90 percent of young males and 80 percent of young females engaged in some form of activism. The much more violent Second Intifada (2000–2005) was led by adults in the Palestine Liberation Organization following the collapse of the 1993 Oslo Accords.|$|R
5|$|This in turn {{endangered}} Libyan {{control over}} the Aouzou <b>Strip,</b> and Aouzou <b>fell</b> in August to the FANT, only to be repelled by an overwhelming Libyan counter-offensive and the French refusal to provide air cover to the Chadians. Habré readily replied to this setback with the first Chadian incursion in Libyan territory of the Chadian–Libyan conflict, mounting on 5 September a surprise and fully successful raid against the key Libyan air base at Maaten al-Sarra. This attack {{was part of a}} plan to remove the threat of Libyan airpower before a renewed offensive on Aouzou.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{intensity}} of tree regeneration in the initial phase of development of future coppice stand. The research was conducted in PR Na Voskopě in the Czech Karst on an experimental strip measuring 25 x 125 m. This <b>strip</b> was <b>felled</b> {{in the early spring}} of 2015 (JELENECKÁ, 2015), there were 14 standards left for the future development of coppice-with-standards forest. The most abundant tree species are hornbeam (Carpinus betulus) and oak (Quercus sp.), there is also the maple (Acer campestre) and service tree (Sorbus torminalis), other trees have only a minimal representation. The average measured age of the felled oak equals 87 years and that of hornbeam equals 74 years, after model calculation for the hornbeam the average age was assessed as 68 years. On the <b>felled</b> <b>strip</b> there were 538 stumps recorded {{at the end of the}} growing season (3. - 4. 10. 2015), eight parameters of stump and root re-sprouting (height of the highest sprouts, total number of sprouts, the average height of sprouts, the largest horizontal width of the whole sprouting bunch, browsing rate of sprouts, presence of root sprouts and the sprout cluster presence). The analysis used data taken from Field-Map inventory (JELENECKÁ, 2015). Evaluation of the data showed that DBH has a significant effect on the regeneration of sprouts mainly for the hornbeam, but no effect for the oak. Topographic gradient along the strip also has some effect on the regeneration of sprouts, oak more intensively regenerates at the bottom of the slope and hornbeam in the upper part of the slope. Amid the slope there was some reduction in regeneration, most probably due to the game influence (mouflons). Browsing sprouts is on this experimental strip enormous. Despite adverse weather conditions (drought and heat) in 2015 regenerates in this relatively extreme habitat 91 % stumps...|$|R
50|$|Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford threw four interceptions, as Tampa Bay upset Detroit 24-21. The Buccaneers {{became the}} first team since 1978 to start the season 0-8 and win their next three games. Stafford was leading the Lions on a {{potential}} game-winning or game-tying drive in the final minute. At the Tampa Bay 28 yard line with 1:00 left, Stafford threw to Calvin Johnson at the 3 yard line. Johnson appeared to catch the ball, but it was <b>stripped</b> out and <b>fell</b> {{into the hands of}} Johnthan Banks for an interception, and sealed the win for Tampa Bay.|$|R
50|$|On {{the week}} ending November 13, American Made Music to Strip By debuted at number thirty-eight on the Billboard 200 chart in the United States. The first week {{sales for the}} project were not {{released}} by Nielsen SoundScan. The album fell to number sixty-three in its second week, and fell once more to ninety-nine the following week. American Made Music to <b>Strip</b> By <b>fell</b> to number one hundred thirty-one in its fourth charting week. The album was number one hundred eighty-eight (188) in its fifth week, and fell off the chart the following week. The album re-entered the charts for the week ending January 15, 2000, charting at number one hundred and sixty-seven (167) for the week; it fell off the chart the week after. American Made Music to Strip By had sold an estimated 234,631 copies in the United States as of June 2000. In Canada, the album failed {{to appear on the}} official albums chart in the country. Despite this, American Made Music to Strip By received a gold certification from Music Canada, denoting sales of 40,000 copies. The album entered the official albums chart in the United Kingdom at number one hundred seventy-nine.|$|R
5000|$|Like other characters, such as Linus and Schroeder (who {{were also}} {{introduced}} to the strip as babies), Sally grew up quickly. On August 22, 1960, she took her first steps, {{and in the next}} day's <b>strip</b> she <b>fell</b> in love with Linus for the first time. Her first day of kindergarten came on September 5, 1962. Although the first glimpse of her new school made her run away screaming, she had a wonderful day once she got there. Unfortunately, her lack of aptitude for formal education quickly became apparent, as she nervously admitted in a later strip that she was sure they had made her go through kindergarten again because she had failed flower-bringing. Nevertheless, she did eventually complete kindergarten and settled in at about first or second grade age {{for the remainder of the}} strip's run.Interestingly, it was originally Linus who expressed a possible romantic interest in Sally. In a strip appearing shortly after Sally's birth, Linus is seen scribbling calculations on a fence. When Charlie Brown wanders by, Linus asks him, [...] "When I'm 22 and Sally is 17, do you think she'll go out with me?" [...] When Schulz revived the joke more than a year later, though, it was Sally who fell for Linus rather than the other way around.|$|R
5000|$|At {{first the}} fuzes were only used in {{situations}} where {{they could not be}} captured by the Germans. They were used in land-based artillery in the South Pacific in 1944. Also in 1944, fuzes were allocated to the British Army's Anti-Aircraft Command, that was engaged in defending Britain against the V-1 flying bomb. As most of the British heavy anti-aircraft guns were deployed in a long, thin coastal <b>strip,</b> dud shells <b>fell</b> into the sea, safely out of reach of capture. Over the course of the German V-1 campaign, the proportion of flying bombs flying through the coastal gun belt that were destroyed rose from 17% to 74%, reaching 82% during one day. A minor problem encountered by the British was that the fuses were sensitive enough to detonate the shell if it passed too close to a seagull and a number of seagull [...] "kills" [...] were recorded.|$|R
2500|$|Gray died in May 1968 of cancer, and {{the strip}} was {{continued}} under other cartoonists. Gray's cousin and assistant Robert Leffingwell {{was the first}} on the job but proved inadequate and the strip was handed over to Tribune staff artist Henry Arnold and general manager Henry Raduta as the search continued for a permanent replacement. Tex Blaisdell, an experienced comics artist, got the job with Elliot Caplin as writer. Caplin avoided political themes and concentrated instead on character stories. The two worked together six years on the <b>strip,</b> but subscriptions <b>fell</b> off and both left {{at the end of}} 1973. The strip was passed to others and during this time complaints were registered regarding Annie's appearance, her conservative politics, and her lack of spunk. Early in 1974, David Lettick took the strip, but his Annie was drawn in an entirely different and more [...] "cartoonish" [...] style, leading to reader complaints, and he left after only three months. In April 1974, {{the decision was made to}} reprint Gray's classic strips, beginning in 1936. Subscriptions increased.|$|R
40|$|Different {{versions}} of silage in which 10 — 30 % {{was formed by}} twigs of trees from current growth or 10 — 40 % pine bark free of cork were drawn up. These two kinds of food and two others: dried shoots of woody plants and fresh pine bark, were used {{during the period from}} 1976 — 1979 for supplementary winter fodder for red deer in an enclo-sure, and for roe-deer, fallow deer and red deer in 4 open biotopes in the lowland forests of Poland. Almost 100 % of the twigs of trees and shrubs of 17 deciduous species and pine bark in such silage, were consumed by the deer. The twigs of different species were equally readily consumed in silage, including those species which are avoided or not readily consumed in the fresh or dried form, e. g., Frangula alnus and Symphorycarpus album. Dried twigs were eaten less readily, about 19. 9 — 53. 5 % of total mass, while the thicker parts of twigs were not eaten at all, even under conditions of extreme hunger in the enclosure. Dry branches were eaten selectively, Populus tremula and Sorbus aucuparia being most favoured. Red deer readily <b>stripped</b> bark from <b>felled</b> trees. One pine (about 100 years old) supplied them with as much fresh bark {e. g., 13. 1 kg) as they strip from 657 to 2628 growing pines (about 8 years old), causing great damage by stripping in this way. It was found that silage containing twigs or bark, and also bark on felled pines, form food readily and completely consumed in winter by deer: there may be considerable benefit from supplying them with such fodder and may result in, inter alia, reducing the considerable damage done by browsing and bark-stripping...|$|R
