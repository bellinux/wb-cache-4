500|$|... "Touch My Body" [...] rides a {{relatively}} restrained slow-dance groove, with some light, orchestral-synth flourishes thrown in.

Indeed, she almost quietly slides into the chorus. [...] "If you run around and brag about this secret rendezvous, I will hunt you down", she sings, letting the last line trail off. But you don't necessarily believe her, as the feel is more playful that sinful.|$|E
