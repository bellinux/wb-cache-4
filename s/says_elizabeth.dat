'In {{the year}} before the great rebellion, two young men from Newcastle were {{sporting}} on the high moors above Eldson, and after pursuing their game several hours, sat down to dine in a green glen near one of the mountain streams. After their repast, the younger lad ran to the brook for water, and after stooping to drink, was surprised, on lifting his head again, by the appearance of a brown dwarf, who stood on a crag covered with brackens, across the burn. This extraordinary personage {{did not appear to be}} above half the stature of a common man, but was uncommonly stout and broad-built, having the appearance of vast strength. His dress was entirely brown, the color of the brackens, and his head covered with frizzled red hair. His countenance was expressive of the most savage ferocity, and his eyes glared like a bull. It seems he addressed the young man first, threatening him with his vengeance for having trespassed on his demesnes, and asking him if he knew in whose presence he stood? The youth replied that he now supposed him to be the lord of the moors; that he offended through ignorance; and offered to bring him the game he had killed. The dwarf was a little mollified by this submission, but remarked that nothing could be more offensive to him than such an offer, as he considered the wild animals as his subjects, and never failed to avenge their destruction. He condescended further to inform him that he was, like himself, mortal, though of years far exceeding the lot of common humanity, and (what I should not have had an idea of) that he hoped for salvation. He never, he added, fed on anything that had life, but lived in the summer on whortleberries, and in winter on nuts and apples, of which he had great store in the woods. Finally, he invited his new acquaintance to accompany him home and partake his hospitality, an offer which the youth was on the point of accepting, and was just going to spring across the brook (which if he had done, <b>says</b> <b>Elizabeth,</b> the dwarf would certainly have torn him in pieces), when his foot was arrested by the voice of his companion, who thought he had tarried long, and on looking round again, [...] "the wee brown man was fled." [...] The story adds that he was imprudent enough to slight the admonition, and to sport over the moors on his way homewards, but soon after his return he fell into a lingering disorder, and died within the year'" [...] (Scott).|$|E

5000|$|At Whyteleafe Elizabeth discovers a new world. Because of her {{mischief}} she {{is first}} disliked by her fellow students and she pets out eleven things {{on her chest}} of drawers, instead of the permitted six and when Elizabeth refuses to put any away Nora confiscates five of the things, which includes photos of her family. The next morning, she refuses {{to get out of}} bed so, with Ruth's help, she strips all the bedclothes off her and then tips her out of bed. Elizabeth fumes at Nora, but loses some of her defiance when she threatens to spank her with a hairbrush. One day, Elizabeth hears about the village and the shops there, but nobody will go with her so she goes alone which is not allowed. She meets Rita and she tells her that a girl in her class - Joan Townsend - is not happy, as her parents neglect her, and Elizabeth promises to try to make friends with Joan, and she finally wins her over, and soon they become best friends and Joan talks about how much she loves her mother and how hurt she is by her mother's neglect. Joan knows that her mother will not send her any birthday presents or cake Elizabeth is soon reported at the meeting by her schoolfellows who are sick of her and she loses a lot of privileges. After that meeting Joan convinces her that misbehaving to be expelled is a bad idea, and advises her to be good, and to ask the heads of the school to tell her parents that she is unhappy and to ask them to take her away, but not in disgrace. Elizabeth accepts this suggestion, and her behaviour improves a lot. She also makes good progress at her piano lessons and secretly longs to play at the function held after the half-term break, though she knows this will not be possible if she goes home at half term. One day, Elizabeth plays a trick on Harry and he retaliates by pinning a note on her that says 'I'M THE BOLD BAD GIRL! BEWARE! I BARK I BITE I HAVE EVERYBODY!" [...] and everyone laughs except Elizabeth who slaps Harry in the face and calls him a cheat. Nora comes along just then and points out that that behavior is not acceptable and orders her to apologize to Harry. Elizabeth initially refuses, but when Nora explains things to her she agrees to, even though she is sure Harry will not accept the apology and it'll make everything worse, but Harry accepts the apology graciously and everyone is friendly again. Elizabeth receives a pound note from a relative and decides to use it to purchase a large cake, presents, and cards to be sent to Joan for her birthday, as if from her parents. Nora finds out and says [...] "Elizabeth! Why didn't you hand that money in?" [...] "I forgot" [...] <b>says</b> <b>Elizabeth</b> and Nora reports her at the meeting. Elizabeth still won't say what she used the money for and finally it is decided to leave the matter until she receives a reply from Mrs Townsend. Soon Joan's birthday comes and she is overjoyed at the presents, but when she writes to her mother to thank her, her mother replies that she did not send anything. Joan is distressed, wanders off in the rain, and becomes very ill. Elizabeth writes to Joan's mother to confess her role in making Joan ill. Joan's contrite mother arrives to visit Joan, and explains to the heads that her neglect of Joan stems from a resentment that Joan survived an illness years before, while her more loved twin brother died. Joan and her mother reconcile, and Joan becomes happy again, while Miss Best explains to William and Rita that the money was used for a very kind cause, and so they summon Elizabeth up to their office and explain to her that she did a right thing in a wrong way and that they will just tell the meeting they are satisfied with the explanation. Sometime later, John grumbles about nobody helping him in the garden except her and she's no use because she's leaving in a week. Elizabeth sits on the swings and says [...] "Elizabeth Allen, you really are cutting your nose off to spite your face! You are perfectly happy here and you have a friend who will miss you when you leave and you want to play the piano at the concert at the end of this term. You really should change your mind and decide to stay.", and at the next meeting, everyone is amazed.|$|E

5000|$|It's {{the last}} few weeks of the Summer {{vacation}} and Elizabeth is getting a bit bored and lonely, so her mother springs a surprise on her in the form of Arabella. Elizabeth is excited but soon finds out she doesn't like Arabella very much and the dislike is mutual, but Elizabeth decides to do her best to hide her dislike, telling herself [...] "Be careful, Elizabeth Allen. You're very good at making enemies, but as you found last term, that only makes things difficult for you and your friends. Arabella's a silly, empty-headed doll. You let Whyteleafe deal with her and don't try to cure her all by yourself", Thankfully school restarts soon and Elizabeth won't have {{to have anything to do}} with Arabella unless she wants to. As well as Arabella, there are three new students that term; two boys and one girl. Martin seems a pleasant enough chap. Julian is an excellent mimic and very, very clever but he is very untidy, lazy and lackadaisical and Rosemary is a nice girl, but is very timid and weak. Elizabeth soon sees Julian right at the bottom of the form and says [...] "Julian, you really ought to try to be top" [...] "Couldn't be bothered" [...] he says [...] "Who wants to learn about the tallest mountains? I'm not going to climb them. Who wants to learn history dates? I'll forget them when I grow up, so I couldn't care less. Lessons are pointless and anyway, you're just telling me to work hard because you're a goody-goody monitor." [...] Elizabeth goes to walk off in a huff, but Julian says [...] "Oh, c'mon, I'm only teasing. Your friend Joan is in a higher form now, so you won't see much of her for quite a while, so why don't you make friends with me?" [...] and Elizabeth does so. At the next meeting, Julian makes a noise like a bubbling saucepan and poor Elizabeth is stuck between a rock and a hard place. She knows she should report him, but he's a new boy and her new best friend. She glares at him and he stops and William says [...] "It is not funny to hold up a school meeting" [...] and Elizabeth takes the money box round and Arabella does not put all her money in; she keeps a pound to herself and Rosemary gives the game away when she says that peppermint chocolates are such good value. Jenny goes to have a look in Arabella's cubicle and sees the chocolates in her music case [...] "Arabella has kept money back and spent it all on chocolates! How mean" [...] she tells her form in disgust [...] "Well" [...] says Harry [...] "let's show her what we think of her! I bet at the next meeting she'll put all her money in the box." [...] and everyone gives Arabella the cold shoulder and at the next meeting she says [...] "The whole form is making fun of me for no reason that I can see." [...] William asks someone to explain why they're giving Arabella such a hard time and Jenny says [...] "Well, William, Arabella kept money back for herself and spent it all on chocolates" [...] William consults Elizabeth about it, but she has to say she doesn't really know what Jenny is talking about. Arabella is made to give all her change to Elizabeth and will only have ten pence that week. When the meeting breaks up she says [...] "Why didn't someone tell me about Arabella? I felt like a fool!" [...] and Jenny explains that she thought Arabella was her friend. One day, Rosemary has to say her money keeps disappearing and no, she hasn't got a hole in her pocket, so Elizabeth marks a coin to see if it disappears and if so, who could have been mean enough to take it and on the next rainy day, the children spin coins and Julian has the marked coin. Elizabeth tackles him over it and Julian denies having stolen it and they split up. Arabella spreads a rumour and Julian plays tricks on Elizabeth to pay her back. In Miss Ranger's class, the books seem to leap off the desk by themselves and Miss Ranger is not pleased [...] "Go out of the room, Elizabeth! Once was probably an accident, twice may have been but not three times. You're a monitor and you should know that that sort of behaviour is not acceptable in a class room" [...] Elizabeth goes and horror of horrors, here comes Rita [...] "I was sent outside, but it was for something that wasn't my fault" [...] she explains but Rita says [...] "Don't let it happen again. You know that monitors should not do things that get them sent outside". In the French teacher's class, mysterious drops of water fall on Elizabeth's head [...] "Ooh" [...] she says [...] "what is happening?" [...] The French teacher thinks Elizabeth is horsing around and says [...] "One more sound out of you and you go outside. This is a classroom, not a circus" [...] and Elizabeth makes up her mind not to make another sound; she'd rather get saturated than sent outside again. At the end of class, Harry says [...] "Elizabeth, how could you behave like that? Let me feel your head." [...] and unfortunately it's as dry as a bone, so Elizabeth doesn't have a leg to stand on. Arabella's birthday comes up and she decides to have a midnight feast and doesn't tell Elizabeth who that night hears a terrific BANG! and when she goes to investigate, she sees Julian with biscuits in his hand [...] "Julian" [...] she says [...] "you're stealing biscuits now! Put them back at once!" [...] and in the process makes an awful noise, so the midnight feast has to be cancelled. Julian puts sneezing powder in Elizabeth's French book and she starts sneezing helplessly. She is told to stop and has to say [...] "I can't A-TISH-OOOOOO help it" [...] and is sent outside again and William comes along, sees her not sneezing there and thinks Elizabeth was just playing a childish prank. She reports Julian for stealing the biscuits, but Arabella explains that they were part of the midnight feast menu and poor Elizabeth realizes that she was wrong about at least the biscuits. William says “Elizabeth, you have accused Julian wrongly of stealing and also twice you have been thrown out of the room for playing stupid pranks. That is not the behaviour of a monitor, so you must step down and we will choose someone else in your place.” Elizabeth rushes out in tears and Julian begins to feel a bit guilty “I know she accused me wrongly of stealing, but she didn’t really play the fool in class; her behaviour was really the results of my tricks” thinks Julian. Elizabeth is summoned to William’s office and she explains why she thought Julian was a thief. Julian is then summoned and says “Oh, I see. A lolly of Elizabeth’s fell out of my pocket, did it? And there was a marked coin in my pocket? So that’s why Elizabeth accused me of stealing, eh? Well, I can now see her point, but I never laid a finger on her lollies or money; someone must have tried to frame me. Anyway, it was not Elizabeth’s fault she got kicked out of class twice.” He turns to Elizabeth and says “Elizabeth, I put some springs under your books and that was what made them fly off your desk. I also put some pellets above your head so they’d leak water on you. And I put sneezing powder in your French book.” Elizabeth laughs when she remembers what happened, her books flying off the desk in particular and she laughs “You’re a real sport” says Julian “I never thought you’d laugh when I told you about the tricks I played on you. Now I like you almost as much as I did before, so will you be my friend again?” “Oh, yes” she <b>says.</b> <b>Elizabeth</b> is a bit mopey and serious for a few days, so Julian plays a trick in the science class and everyone ends up rolling in the aisles with laughter and suddenly everyone’s friendly again. At the next meeting William says “Julian, you should use your brains for work and not just for jokes and tricks.” “Oh, I couldn’t care less about being bottom” Julian replies rudely “I see” says William kindly “but I must warn you punishment will come for your laziness and it will, alas be a terrible one” It’s soon time for the kids’ end of term outing and Julian’s mother isn’t there yet and Julian reckons the car must have broken down, but he soon finds out the reason for his mother’s lateness is far more sinister; she’s suddenly very, very ill. Julian races out into the garden and when Elizabeth finds him, he wails “My mother’s very, very ill; she mightn’t live. Why didn’t I use my brains for good, worthwhile work instead of only for tricks and jokes? I know my mother couldn’t care less about grades, but I wish now I’d been top instead of bottom. William was right, punishment was awaiting me and it could not have been a more terrible one.” Martin starts to feel very uncomfortable and finally decides to own up that he was the one who was the thief and who framed Julian “You horrid thief!” she cries “You nasty, beastly, rotten, double-faced thief! So it was you who put that coin and those lollies of mine into Julian’s pocket! Think of all the damage you’ve done. Because of you I thought that Julian was a thief and I accused him and he played tricks that got me sent outside and I lost my position as a monitor. How could you sleep at night?” getting up and walking away. She goes to the music practice room and Rosemary comes in “Why were you so beastly to Martin?” she asks “You know he’s so kind and generous” and Elizabeth thinks “Martin really is a puzzle. How can one person be both kind and unkind; both mean and generous? It just doesn’t make sense.” The maths class is interrupted by a phone call for none other than Julian and he comes back and says “My mum’s better. MY MUM’S BETTER!” Miss Ranger lets the class off early; nobody will be able to do any more lessons; they’re too hyper. That night, Elizabeth simply cannot sleep so she goes to have a look at “William’s Big Book” to see if there’s any explanation for Martin’s strange behaviour and she finds an article about a girl named Tessa who stole things to give to others to win their favour and that’s basically what Martin does. Elizabeth confronts Martin and he says “I feel simply dreadful, Elizabeth. What can I do to make things better?” “Well, there’s only one thing to do and a coward like you would never do it. You ought to own up at the next school meeting.”, and lo and behold, just as the meeting is about to break up a voice says “Hang on. I’ve got something to say” and it is Martin “William” he says “I was the one who stole the biscuits, cakes, money and lollies and I planted the marked coin on Julian so everyone would think it was him, not me. I would never have owned up except Julian’s mother was ill and I hated to think I did that to someone who was so miserable. Also, someone said I was a coward and I’m not really” “Aww” thinks Elizabeth “look at that. He so badly wanted people to like him and they don’t seem to, and now he’s had to confess something that will make them dislike him even more. That was a brave thing to do.”, standing up and saying “Well, it wasn’t the usual kind of stealing, it wasn’t just badness. You see, he stole things to give to people to win their favour. There’s an article in the book about a girl, whose name was Tessa who behaved just like him. Wait a minute and I’ll find it.”, turning to the right page “How did you know about Tessa?” asks William “Well, Martin told me all he’d done and I was disgusted” she says “but all the same, the kids say he’s kind and I wondered what made Martin tick, so I looked in the book and found that.” “Well, Martin” says William kindly “you can’t just buy friends; you have to earn them, so don’t steal any more things from your fellows; just be kind, generous and fun to be with and you’ll soon have more friends than you can count.” The meeting finally breaks up and there’s only time for an apology from Martin to Julian and a quick dinner. Near the end of the term, Elizabeth gets more than she bargained for on her walk with Julian when some kid falls into the lake. She rescues him and comes back to school dripping wet. She changes her clothes and saunters back to dinner, not wanting any fuss, but at the next school meeting they hear about the heroic deed. “It was Elizabeth” says Julian “it was our Elizabeth” Everyone cheers her on and Elizabeth is asked to choose a reward and she says “Well, there’s a fair on in a nearby town, so could you please let everyone have a few days off to go there?” and Miss Best agrees. Julian then stands up and says “And please make Elizabeth a monitor again; she deserves it.”, and his request is also granted ...|$|E

A warrant for Sirven’s arrest was issued on 20 January 1762, but the family was able to escape in time. A sentence passed on them in absentia on 29 March 1764 condemned the father to be broken on the wheel, the mother to be hanged and the two surviving daughters to be banished.
