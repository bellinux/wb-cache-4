5|$|The {{institute}} {{and the society}} experienced a hiatus {{during the course of}} the war. The school held sessions under Reverend Nelson, and subsequently William C. Clayton in 1866.

The Romney Literary Society was revived in 1869, and following the passage of a bill which established the West Virginia <b>Schools</b> <b>for</b> the Deaf and Blind in March 1870, the society offered the institute's building and grounds to the state of West Virginia for the new school. The institute's property was transferred to the state and the West Virginia <b>Schools</b> <b>for</b> the Deaf and Blind opened for its first term on September 29, 1870. Following the schools' subsequent expansions, the institute's former building became the center portion of the administration building of the West Virginia <b>Schools</b> <b>for</b> the Deaf and Blind, in which capacity it serves at the present day. In addition to Jacob and Clayton, Robert White, Attorney General of West Virginia, was also an alumnus of the institute.|$|E
