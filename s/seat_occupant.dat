40|$|Data on 2520 {{occupants}} of cars involved in accidents were analysed {{in relation to}} injury and {{the severity of the}} crash to investigate the effect of rear seat passengers on injury to restrained and unrestrained front <b>seat</b> <b>occupants</b> and vice versa. Unrestrained front <b>seat</b> <b>occupants</b> showed a higher incidence of serious injury when there were rear seat passengers. The presence of a rear seat passenger did not affect significantly the overall incidence of injury among restrained front <b>seat</b> <b>occupants</b> within the range of crash severity considered. Unrestrained rear seat passengers behind unrestrained front <b>seat</b> <b>occupants</b> showed a higher incidence of moderate injury and a lower incidence of no injury than those behind restrained front <b>seat</b> <b>occupants.</b> It is concluded that legislation on seat belts has not greatly increased the risk of person to person injury...|$|R
40|$|The {{severity}} of injuries sustained by 2577 car occupants in road traffic accidents in the catchment area of one district accident service during February 1982 to January 1984 inclusive {{was assessed using}} the injury severity score system. In the first 12 months the mean injury severity score for front <b>seat</b> <b>occupants</b> injured in a road traffic accident was 4. 94 {{and in the second}} 12 month period, after the implementation of the seat belt law, the mean injury severity score of all injured front <b>seat</b> <b>occupants</b> was 2. 80. These figures indicated a reduction in injury {{severity of}} front <b>seat</b> <b>occupants</b> of 53. 4 % on the previous 12 month figures. The severity of injury sustained by unbelted front <b>seat</b> <b>occupants</b> and back <b>seat</b> passengers showed no significant change over the two years. The number of front <b>seat</b> <b>occupants</b> killed or sustaining serious injuries (injury severity score greater than 12) showed a reduction of 54 % in the 12 months beginning February 1983. Front <b>seat</b> <b>occupants</b> requiring admission for injuries sustained showed a decline of 42 % in the 12 months after the introduction of the seat belt law, and deaths among front <b>seat</b> <b>occupants</b> fell by 27 % compared with the previous 12 months. After the implementation of seat belt legislation those front <b>seat</b> <b>occupants</b> killed or sustaining serious injuries included a significantly higher proportion of victims who were not wearing their seat belts or showed positive evidence of alcohol intake {{at the time of the}} accident.

5000|$|Instead of {{floor-mounted}} cyclic sticks {{between the}} pilot's knees, the R22 uses a unique teetering [...] "T-Bar" [...] control {{connected to a}} stick that emerges from the console between the seats. This {{makes it easier for}} occupants to enter and exit the cabin and reduces chances for injury {{in the event of a}} hard landing. The teetering bar has a hand grip on both sides that hangs down between the pilots' legs. Thus, if teetered to the right, the right side pilot would be flying and the left grip would be about 12 inches above the left pilot's lap. R22 flight instructors quickly learn how to fly with their hand in the air. The left part of the bar, left collective control, and left tail rotor pedals can be removed if the left <b>seat</b> <b>occupant</b> is not certified to fly the R22 or if the space is needed for technical or observer duties. A floor-mounted foot-activated push-to-talk switch facilitates intercom communications for the left <b>seat</b> <b>occupant,</b> although some later models may be equipped with a voice activated intercom system.|$|E
50|$|Side-impact airbags or side torso airbags (side thorax/abdomen airbags) are a {{category}} of airbag usually located in the seat or door panel, and inflate between the <b>seat</b> <b>occupant</b> and the door. These airbags are designed {{to reduce the risk}} of injury to the pelvic and lower abdomen regions. Most vehicles are now being equipped with different types of designs, to help reduce injury and ejection from the vehicle in rollover crashes. More recent side airbag designs include a two chamber system; a firmer lower chamber for the pelvic region and softer upper chamber for the ribcage.|$|E
5000|$|Beltbags: The beltbag is an {{inflatable}} seat-belt strap that {{is able to}} reduce the risk of injury to passengers in the rear in a head-on collision by lessening the strain placed on the ribcage. Should the crash sensors detect a severe frontal impact, the airbag control unit will trigger deployment and inflation of the beltbag. A gas generator then inflates the multi-layered belt strap with Velcro seams to nearly three times its normal width. The resulting larger surface area is able to better distribute the force acting on the <b>seat</b> <b>occupant,</b> thereby reducing the risk of injury.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the main}} changes made from the {{preceding}} Moth series was necessitated {{by a desire to}} improve access to the front cockpit, since the training requirement specified that the front <b>seat</b> <b>occupant</b> {{had to be able to}} escape easily, especially when wearing a parachute. Access to the front cockpit of the Moth predecessors was restricted by the proximity of the aircraft's fuel tank directly above the front cockpit and the rear cabane struts for the upper wing. The solution adopted was to shift the upper wing forward but sweep the wings back to maintain the centre of lift. Other changes included a strengthened structure, fold-down doors on both sides of the cockpit and a revised exhaust system.|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} is a two-seater {{with the}} rear <b>seat</b> <b>occupant</b> controlling the radar. Although cockpit controls are duplicated across cockpits, it is normal for the aircraft to be flown {{only from the}} front seat. The pilot flies the aircraft {{by means of a}} centre stick and left hand throttles. The rear cockpit has only two small vision ports {{on the sides of the}} canopy. The presence of the WSO (weapon systems operator) in the rear cockpit improves aircraft effectiveness since the WSO is entirely dedicated to radar operations and weapons deployment, thus decreasing the workload of the pilot and increasing efficiency. Both cockpits are fitted with zero/zero ejection seats which allow the crew to eject at any altitude and airspeed.|$|E
50|$|The Berkut is {{descended from}} the Rutan Long-EZ, with the primary {{differences}} being retractable main landing gear, dual canopies, and molded fuselage, strakes, and spar. Like the Long EZ, the Berkut carries 2 people in tandem seats. The front <b>seat</b> <b>occupant</b> has access to all instrumentation and controls. The rear seat, normally holding the passenger, {{is equipped with a}} side stick and throttle, but no rudder pedals, brakes, or instruments. Aerodynamically, optimizations to the original Long-EZ airframe were made to increase performance and interior space. The fuselage was stretched, and the nose, canard, instrument panel and pilot moved forward one foot, to allow a heavier engine {{to be used in the}} back. The main wing trailing edge was straightened, removing a small bend in the trailing edge of the Long EZ wing. The lower winglet was removed and the aileron size increased in both chord and span, significantly increasing roll rate.|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} the fatality risk for occupants of rear passenger seats in extended cab and crew cab pickup trucks to the fatality risk for front <b>seat</b> <b>occupants</b> {{of the same}} vehicles using the (US) Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) for 1982 – 1997. A 10 -digit truncated vehicle identification number was used to classify the pickup trucks. The data were analyzed with an estimating equation for data having few observations per stratum. We identified 549 extended cab pickup trucks {{with one or more}} occupants of rear passenger seats and one or more occupant deaths. Occupants of rear passenger seats had a fatality risk 43 % lower than front <b>seat</b> <b>occupants</b> (95 % confidence interval 32 % to 52 %), controlling for age, sex, and restraint use. <b>Occupants</b> of rear <b>seats</b> of extended cabs in compact pickup trucks did not experience any higher fatality risk (relative to front-seat occupants of the same vehicles) than rear <b>seat</b> <b>occupants</b> of extended cabs in full-size pickup trucks and large 4 -door crew cabs...|$|R

40|$|This project {{helped to}} {{identify}} priorities {{for improving the}} safety of rear <b>seat</b> <b>occupants</b> through a literature review and NASS-CDS injury analysis. The literature review covers injury patterns of rear <b>seat</b> <b>occupants,</b> new safety technologies intended for the rear seat, studies of rear seat belt and seat geometry, and methods for assessing belt fit; key points follow. Most rear-seat cushion lengths exceed the recommended length of 440 mm intended for accommodating adults. Since children make up 70 % of rear <b>seat</b> <b>occupants,</b> built-in booster <b>seats</b> with shorter cushion lengths designed to accommodate children aged 5 - 8 would be beneficial. Front seats tend to have steeper outboard lap-belt angles, more forward shoulder belt anchors, and narrower spacing between lap belt anchorages than in the rear seat; target lap belt angles in the rear seat should range from 45 to 70 degrees. Booster seats are potentially more effective at mitigating poor lap belt geometry than poor shoulder belt geometry, so improving shoulder belt geometry in the rear seat should have higher priority. Load limiters, seatbelt pretensioners, and inflatable belt systems are potential countermeasures for reducing thoracic injury for rear <b>seat</b> <b>occupants.</b> If load limiters are installed in rear seats, the amount of available space for occupant displacement would be more important to consider in the rear seat than in the front seat. The NASS-CDS database was first used to identify rear-row <b>occupant</b> <b>seating</b> patterns. In the second row, adults tend {{to sit on the}} right side, but this is not true for children.

40|$|This paper {{described}} {{a study on}} the dynamic responses and injury risk of rear <b>seat</b> <b>occupant</b> in side impact. A PSM (Prescribed Structure Motion) model was created based on a passenger car model, which consists of car side structures, a SID-Ils dummy and rear seat in MADYMO environment. The structural responses of the vehicle body were obtained from the FE simulation of side impact. The kinematics of the vehicle body were imported into MADYMO PSM model as loading condition, consequently the kinematic responses of the dummy were acquired from the PSM simulation. It was noticed that the rear <b>seat</b> <b>occupant</b> subjected to a serious head injury, but pelvis force was much smaller than the specified value in C-NCAP (2012). A parametric study was implemented in three impact locations and two impact angles to investigate the risk of head injury. The results show that the head of rear occupant was most likely to be injured in side impact, and the HIC values were large under different form impact In addition, the HIC values of dummy head varied slightly with the different impact positions and angles. Therefore, it is representative that the HIC level of the rear dummy was analyzed through the simulation according to requirement in C-NCAP...|$|E

40|$|Major {{gains in}} {{occupant}} protection in automotive crashes {{have been made}} {{over the past few}} decades, with the introduction of technologies such as airbags and seat belt pretensioners. However, the focus, both in terms of regulation and consumer testing, has been on front seat occupants. With rear seat occupants being over-represented in vehicle fatalities, {{there is a need to}} examine protection offered to those who sit in the back seat of motor vehicles. This thesis consists of six inter-related studies focused on characterising the rates and biomechanical mechanisms of the injury to rear seat occupants (not using child restraints), and evaluations of both existing and novel technologies for improving injury outcomes for rear seat occupants. The methods used include in-depth crash investigation and crash sled testing, with a focus on children aged 8 - 16 and older occupants. The results of these studies indicate that substantial casualty savings in rear seat occupants might be achieved through the implementation of existing technology to front seat occupants. While the results of the in-depth crash investigation demonstrated that injury mechanisms differ between front and rear seat occupants, it was found from sled testing that tailoring existing technologies to meet the needs of rear seat occupants, such as younger and older occupants, may substantially improve rear <b>seat</b> <b>occupant</b> protection. Vehicle regulation and consumer testing has previously been an effective method for driving improvements in occupant protection, and it is recommended that vehicle regulation bodies incorporate requirements for performance of the rear <b>seat</b> <b>occupant</b> protection system...|$|E
