5|$|The Raptor {{has three}} {{internal}} weapons bays: a large bay {{on the bottom}} of the fuselage, and two smaller bays on the sides of the fuselage, aft of the engine intakes. The main bay can accommodate six LAU-142/A launchers for beyond-visual-range missiles and each <b>side</b> <b>bay</b> has an LAU-141/A launcher for short-range missiles. Four of the launchers in the main bay can be replaced with two bomb racks that can each carry one 1,000lb (450kg) or four 250lb (110kg) bombs. Carrying armaments internally maintains the aircraft's stealth and minimizes additional drag. Missile launches require the bay doors to be open for less than a second, during which hydraulic arms push missiles clear of the aircraft; this is to reduce vulnerability to detection and to deploy missiles during high speed flight.|$|E
25|$|The F-102 was {{employed}} in the air-to-ground role with limited success, although neither the aircraft nor the training for its pilots were designed for that role. The 509th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron's Deuces arrived at Da Nang Air Base, 4 August 1964 from Clark Air Base, Philippines. The interceptor was equipped with 24 2.75in (70mm) FFARs in the fuselage bay doors. These {{could be used to}} good effect against various types of North Vietnamese targets in daylight. At night it proved less dangerous to use heat-seeking Falcon missiles in conjunction with the F-102's nose-mounted IRST (Infrared Search & Track) on nighttime harassment raids along the Ho Chi Minh trail. Some F-102As were configured to accommodate a single AIM-26 Super Falcon in each <b>side</b> <b>bay</b> in lieu of the two conventional AIM-4 Falcons. Operations with both the F-102A and TF-102A two-seaters (which were used in a Forward Air Control role because its two seats and 2.75in/70mm rockets offered good versatility for the mission) continued in Vietnam until 1968 when all F-102s were returned to the United States.|$|E
2500|$|F-106C : Unbuilt version. Aircraft was {{intended}} to have the AN/ASG-18 radar and fire control system fitted originally developed for the North American XF-108 Rapier. For its time, {{it was the largest}} radar to ever be fitted to a fighter, actually requiring hydraulic actuators to turn the antenna. To accommodate this larger radar system, the nose cone was longer and of greater diameter. The design featured an improved raised canopy design featuring better visibility, canards and lengthened rectangular inlet ducts. The aircraft was to be capable of carrying one GAR-9/AIM-47A in its center bay and one AIM-26A in each <b>side</b> <b>bay.</b> At one time, the US Air Force had considered acquiring 350 of these advanced interceptors, but the F-106C/D project was cancelled on 23 September 1958.|$|E

5000|$|Before its {{reconstruction}} in 1870, {{ordered by}} the count György Festetics, the castle {{was surrounded by a}} park and a lovely garden with a chapel in it.

50|$|In 1845 Thomas B. McDowell {{left the}} house to his son Alexander, who mortgaged it heavily to pay his debts. By this means it {{eventually}} became the property of Alfred Denniston, who probably added the east <b>side's</b> <b>bay</b> window. He sold it to Agnes Corwin in 1871.
