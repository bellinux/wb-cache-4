50|$|There are acid-forming cations (hydrogen and aluminium) {{and there}} are base-forming cations. The {{fraction}} of the base-forming cations that occupy positions on the soil colloids is called the base <b>saturation</b> <b>percentage.</b> If a soil has a CEC of 20 meq and 5 meq are aluminium and hydrogen cations (acid-forming), the remainder of positions on the colloids (20-5 = 15 meq) are assumed occupied by base-forming cations, so that the percentage base saturation is 15/20 x 100% = 75% (the compliment 25% is assumed acid-forming cations). When the soil pH is 7 (neutral), base saturation is 100 percent {{and there are}} no hydrogen ions stored on the colloids. Base saturation is almost in direct proportion to pH (increases with increasing pH). It is of use in calculating the amount of lime needed to neutralise an acid soil. The amount of lime needed to neutralize a soil must take account of the amount of acid forming ions on the colloids not just those in the soil water solution. The addition of enough lime to neutralize the soil water solution will be insufficient to change the pH, as the acid forming cations stored on the soil colloids will tend to restore the original pH condition as they are pushed off those colloids by the calcium of the added lime.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Soil acidity {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{limiting}} factors to acid sensitive crop production in the western areas of Oromia Region, Ethiopia. A Greenhouse incubation experiment was employed on soils of three land use systems to assess the effects of six lime rates and two lime particle sizes on acidity related soil chemical properties after incubation for 90 days. Data generated were subjected to analysis of variance using SAS software. The interactions effects between lime rates and soils from different land use systems significantly affected soil pH and exchangeable acidity. However, the three way interactions between lime rates, lime particle sizes and soils from different land use systems on these soil properties were not significantly different. Increasing lime rates for both lime particle sizes relatively increased soil pH and exchangeable bases thereby reducing the magnitude of soil acidity, exchangeable acidity and Al saturation. However, applied liming rates with 100 mesh size were relatively more effective in reducing acidity-related soil properties and increasing soil pH. When considering the average of acid <b>saturation</b> <b>percentage</b> across the lime particle sizes, incubation of 1 1 soil with lime reduced the acid <b>saturation</b> <b>percentage</b> from 9. 8 in the 0 t ha to 0. 8 % at 10 t ha lime rate in the forest land and similarly from 15. 8 to 3. 6 % in grazing and from 54. 7 to 22. 3 % reduction in acid saturation 1 percentage in cultivated land. Thus, incubation of soil with applied lime rate at 10 t ha showed considerable drop of the acid <b>saturation</b> <b>percentage</b> and reduced soil acidity thereby increasing soils pH and available P in soils of the three land uses.

The integrated study strongly supports the known role of the Farewell Formation as a proven reservoir in the petroleum system in Taranaki Basin.

While these features may coexist at any depth, porosity is more dominant in general and thus plays a deciding role in producing good reservoir quality.

Spatial variations in soil properties are common {{but it is important}} for understanding these changes, particularly in agricultural lands for careful planning and land management. Materials and Methods: To this end, in winter 1391, 189 undisturbed soil samples (0 - 30 cm depth) in a regular lattice with a spacing of 500 m were gathered from the surface of Miankangi land, Sistan plain, and their physical and chemical properties were studied. The land area of the region is about 4, 500 hectares; the average elevation of studied area is 489. 2 meters above sea level with different land uses.

The samples were sintered at 832 °C in air for different times with two intermediate cold-rolling processes and were characterised by transport critical current measurements at 77 K (0 T < B < 0. 5 T), XRD, SEM, and optical microscopy. The effect of silver addition on the formation rate of the high-temperature BiPb(2223) phase is presented.

40|$|The {{expression}} of anemia in infancy and childhood {{differs from that}} in adults with relation to {{the rapid growth of}} various tissues and organs in body. Hence iron metabolism in infancy and childhood has many special features. The purpose of the experiments reported here is to determine the serum iron and the serum iron binding capacity in experimental anemic rabbits and to study further on the metabolism of iron in experimental anemia. The results obtained are as follows; 1) In a single group of rabbits bled at a rate of 25 cc per Kg body Wt. once, serum iron decreased in proportion with the intensity of anemia and the decrease was lowest for 3 to 4 days after bleeding. In rabbits bled repeatedly in small amounts, although a drop in serum iron level was noted, a tendency to return to normal within 1 to 2 days after final bleeding was seen. The <b>percentage</b> <b>saturation</b> is higher before phlebotomy as compared to after, especially in repeated bleeding experiments. From these results it is considered that the pattern of low serum iron and low <b>percentage</b> <b>saturation</b> represents the depletion of tissue stores of iron and the high functional activity of iron binding protein for the iron deficiency in body. 2) An injection of indian ink solution is followed by low serum iron and anemia. The fact that hypoferremia is produced in spite of the blocking of reticulo-endothelial system by Indian ink solution is thought to be due to iron adsorption by carbon particles in indian ink. 3) Repeated intravenous injectios of 1 per cent solution of acidum phenylhydrazine is followed by marked anemia, hyperferremia and high <b>percentage</b> <b>saturation.</b> From these results it was revealed that low <b>percentage</b> <b>saturation</b> of the iron binding protein observed clinically is experimentally observed only within a definite duration immediately after intravenous injection of hemolytic agents...|$|R
