25|$|Biosynthesis of this 31-membered macrocycle {{begins as}} the loading domain is primed with the starter unit, 4,5-dihydroxocyclohex-1-ene-carboxylic acid, which {{is derived from}} the shikimate pathway. Note that the {{cyclohexane}} ring of the <b>starting</b> <b>unit</b> is reduced during the transfer to module 1. The <b>starting</b> <b>unit</b> is then modified by a series of Claisen condensations with malonyl or methylmalonyl substrates, which are attached to an acyl carrier protein (ACP) and extend the polyketide by two carbons each. After each successive condensation, the growing polyketide is further modified according to enzymatic domains that are present to reduce and dehydrate it, thereby introducing the diversity of functionalities observed in rapamycin (figure 1). Once the linear polyketide is complete, L-pipecolic acid, which is synthesized by a lysine cycloamidase from an L-lysine, is added to the terminal end of the polyketide by an NRPS. Then, the NSPS cyclizes the polyketide, giving prerapamycin, the first enzyme-free product. The macrocyclic core is then customized by a series of post-PKS enzymes through methylations by MTases and oxidations by P-450s to yield rapamycin.|$|E

Crispa, however had the edge at the bench since they had noted defensive aces like Padim Israel, Joy Dionisio, Yoyoy Villamin, Bay Cristobal (especially in 1983 under Coach Tommy Manotoc) while Toyota had to contend with Herrera, Javier, Coloso and Bulaong to provide the defensive spunk.|$|E

The generation cost of these units is high so usually it is preferred to keep them offline. However, they usually show good dynamic characteristics that make them very suitable for AGC operation. The startup process of these units is very fast so they can be online and providing regulation within just a few minutes. In this paper a simple algorithm is presented to determine when it is needed to start up an offline rapid <b>start</b> <b>unit</b> to provide AGC service. The algorithm proposed is tested using real operation data.

The White Team comprised the <b>starting</b> <b>unit</b> for the Tigers and, led by Cannon, consisted {{of the most talented}} players, who excelled on both offense and defense. Jim Taylor's graduation allowed Dietzel to give Cannon more time playing on offense. LSU entered the season with talent and depth on both offense and defense. The team defeated its first five opponents by an average of three touchdowns. The sixth game of the season was against Florida for LSU's homecoming. Cannon led the Tigers to a 10–7 win as he scored their only touchdown of the game in the second quarter. The following week the Tigers were ranked first in the AP Poll. The team remained there as it finished the regular season undefeated and was named national champion by the AP and UPI. LSU followed up with a 7–0 victory over Clemson in the Sugar Bowl. Cannon was responsible for all seven points scored in the game; he threw a touchdown pass to Mickey Mangham and then kicked the extra point.|$|E

Captain Kent Lee, commanding officer of the Enterprise, directed the port turn to continue after the first explosion, steering the ship into the wind to blow smoke away from the ship.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the season, LSU {{head coach}} Paul Dietzel experimented with {{different}} methods of keeping players rested. Substitution rules {{at the time}} allowed players to re-enter a game only twice per quarter. Dietzel implemented his [...] "three-platoon system," [...] which split the team into the [...] "White Team," [...] the [...] "Go Team," [...] and the [...] "Chinese Bandits." [...] Each platoon was a unit consisting of eleven players. The White Team was the <b>starting</b> <b>unit.</b> It consisted of the team's most talented players who excelled on both offense and defense. The Go Team was the second string unit that played primarily on offense. The Chinese Bandits were the team's second string defense, and {{was made up of}} mainly underclassmen. Dietzel's plan was to swap players out in a platoon-like fashion in order to keep them rested throughout the game, since most starters played on both offense and defense during this era. Instead of resting individual players, he replaced all eleven players on the field. This system was part of what Dietzel referred to as [...] "efficient football;" [...] to attempt get the most production out of every player on the team.|$|E

2500|$|The {{story of}} the longest 16 seconds in league history would happen in 1980 {{featuring}} the Toyota Tamaraws and the U/Tex Wranglers. The two teams tangled in the Finals of the Open Conference title with U/Tex having the privilege of playing their two imports {{side by side with}} each other. The two, Glenn McDonald and Aaron James, combined forces with Bogs Adornado, Lim Eng Beng and the diminutive Ricky Pineda to form a solid <b>starting</b> <b>unit.</b> Toyota of course had their resident import Andy Fields partnered with another old reliable in King. In Game 4 of the series and U/Tex ahead 2-1, Tommy Manotoc pulled out all his starters and sent in his shock troopers with more than 7 minutes remaining in the game and the Tamaraws up by only 9 points. Reporters bitterly criticized Manotoc's move for conceding the game at such an early stage, but Manotoc justified this by saying the most famous quote, [...] "one step backwards, two steps forward" [...] in reference to the tactic of relieving his star players and giving them enough time to rest in preparation for the all important Game 5. Toyota won Game 4 handily of course. In Game 5, with time down to 16 seconds, U/Tex in possession and Toyota ahead by four 94-90, the 16-second miracle happened. Upon receipt of the inbound pass from Lim Eng Beng, Aaron James cranked up a jumper from 18 feet to bring the game closer by 2, time down to 11 seconds. Toyota had possession, inbounded from the endline, but the full court press of U/Tex somehow added pressure to the Tamaraws. Instead of just holding on to the ball and waiting for a foul while watching the time tick away, the Tamaraws made one hurried pass after another until it reached the frontcourt. In the ensuing play, Arnie Tuadles made a pass to Abe King, who was unmolested in the paint, but his pass was read well by McDonald, who intercepted the ball. Francis Arnaiz, in haste, fouled McDonald in penalty instead of putting up a solid defense against the 6-foot, 6-inch former Celtic. McDonald, in his characteristically cool demeanor, proving once and again that his 1976 championship performance with Boston was no fluke, sank both free throws with time down to 2 seconds left. The game was tied and Toyota couldn't buy a basket in the remaining seconds, forcing the game into overtime, the very first recorded OT in Game 5 in PBA History (and probably the only one to date). At the end of 5 minutes of extension, U/Tex saw itself at the winning end with a 99-98 victory against the hapless Tamaraws which never know what hit them.|$|E
