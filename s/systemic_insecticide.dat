50|$|Carbofuran {{is one of}} {{the most}} toxic {{carbamate}} pesticides. It is marketed under the trade names Furadan, by FMC Corporation and Curater, among several others. It is used to control insects in a wide variety of field crops, including potatoes, corn and soybeans. It is a <b>systemic</b> <b>insecticide,</b> which means that the plant absorbs it through the roots, and from here the plant distributes it throughout its organs where insecticidal concentrations are attained. Carbofuran also has contact activity against pests.|$|E
50|$|Thiamethoxam is a broad-spectrum, <b>systemic</b> <b>insecticide,</b> {{which means}} it is absorbed quickly by plants and transported to all of its parts, {{including}} pollen, where it acts to deter insect feeding.

They are easy to detect because the leaves curl as result of an attack. These aphids can be controlled with a <b>systemic</b> <b>insecticide.</b> Once the trees are in the field since more than two years, treatments are no more necessary because of plant vigor.|$|E
50|$|Imidacloprid is a <b>systemic</b> <b>insecticide</b> {{that acts}} as an insect neurotoxin and belongs to a class of {{chemicals}} called the neonicotinoids which act on {{the central nervous system}} of insects, with much lower toxicity to mammals. The chemical works by interfering with the transmission of stimuli in the insect nervous system. Specifically, it causes a blockage of the nicotinergic neuronal pathway. By blocking nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, imidacloprid prevents acetylcholine from transmitting impulses between nerves, resulting in the insect's paralysis and eventual death. It is effective on contact and via stomach action. Because imidacloprid binds much more strongly to insect neuron receptors than to mammal neuron receptors, this insecticide is more toxic to insects than to mammals.|$|E
50|$|Imidacloprid is a nicotine-derived <b>systemic</b> <b>insecticide,</b> {{belonging}} {{to a group of}} pesticides called neonicotinoids. Although it is off patent, the primary producer of imidacloprid is the German chemical firm Bayer CropScience. The trade names for imidacloprid include Gaucho, Admire, Merit, Advantage, Confidor, Provado, and Winner. Imidacloprid is a neurotoxin that is selectively toxic to insects relative to vertebrates and most non-insect invertebrates. It acts as an agonist on the postsynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of motor neurones in insects. This interaction results in convulsions, paralysis, and eventually death of the poisoned insect. It is effective on contact and via stomach action. Because imidacloprid binds much more strongly to insect neuron receptors than to mammal neuron receptors, this insecticide is selectively more toxic to insects than mammals. As a systemic pesticide, imidacloprid translocates or moves readily in the xylem of plants from the soil into the leaves, fruit, flowers, pollen, nectar, and guttation fluid of plants. Bees may be exposed to imidacloprid when they feed on the nectar, pollen, and guttation fluid of imidacloprid-treated plants.|$|E
25|$|Pesticides can be {{classified}} based upon their biological mechanism function or application method. Most pesticides work by poisoning pests. A systemic pesticide moves inside a plant following absorption by the plant. With insecticides and most fungicides, this movement is usually upward (through the xylem) and outward. Increased efficiency may be a result. <b>Systemic</b> <b>insecticides,</b> which poison pollen and nectar in the flowers, may kill bees and other needed pollinators.|$|R
40|$|With the {{exponential}} {{number of}} published data on neonicotinoids and fipronil {{during the last}} decade, an updated review of literature has been conducted in three parts. The present part focuses on gaps of knowledge that have been addressed after publication of the Worldwide Integrated Assessment (WIA) on <b>systemic</b> <b>insecticides</b> in 2015. More specifically, new data on the mode of action and metabolism of neonicotinoids and fipronil, and their toxicity to invertebrates and vertebrates, were obtained. We included the newly detected synergistic effects and/or interactions of these <b>systemic</b> <b>insecticides</b> with other insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, adjuvants, honeybee viruses, and parasites of honeybees. New studies have also investigated the contamination of all environmental compartments (air and dust, soil, water, sediments, and plants) as well as bees and apicultural products, food and beverages, and the exposure of invertebrates and vertebrates to such contaminants. Finally, we review new publications on remediation of neonicotinoids and fipronil, especially in water systems. Conclusions of the previous WIA in 2015 are reinforced; neonicotinoids and fipronil represent a major threat worldwide for biodiversity, ecosystems, and all the services the latter provide...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} recent {{interest}} in the threat to bees posed {{by the use of}} <b>systemic</b> <b>insecticides.</b> One concern is that <b>systemic</b> <b>insecticides</b> may translocate from the soil into pollen and nectar of plants, where they would be ingested by pollinators. This paper reports on the movement of two such <b>systemic</b> neonicotinoid <b>insecticides,</b> imidacloprid and thiamethoxam, into the pollen and nectar of flowers of squash (Cucurbita pepo cultivars "Multipik," "Sunray" and "Bush Delicata") when applied to soil by two methods: (1) sprayed into soil before seeding, or (2) applied through drip irrigation in a single treatment after transplant. All insecticide treatments were within labeled rates for these compounds. Pollen and nectar samples were analyzed using a standard extraction method widely used for pesticides (QuEChERS) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometric analysis. The concentrations found in nectar, 10 ± 3 ppb (mean ± s. d) for imidacloprid and 11 ± 6 ppb for thiamethoxam, are higher than concentrations of neonicotinoid insecticides in nectar of canola and sunflower grown from treated seed, and similar to those found in a recent study of neonicotinoids applied to pumpkins at transplant and through drip irrigation. The concentrations in pollen, 14 ± 8 ppb for imidacloprid and 12 ± 9 ppb for thiamethoxam, are higher than those found for seed treatments in most studies, but {{at the low end of}} the range found in the pumpkin study.

5000|$|The {{main control}} method {{is through the}} {{application}} of a <b>systemic</b> <b>insecticide.</b> Insecticide is usually applied through a funnel about 5 cm above the infested area of the trunk. The red palm weevil can be monitored using pheromone lures [...] bucket or pitfall traps, and alternative forms of control use field sanitation and mass trapping with traps baited with pheromone and plant derived semiochemicals. New alternative technologies using semiochemicals and bio insecticides are being developed to more effectively control this devastating pest of palm trees. One of them is a new formulation with insecticide and pheromone called SPLAT RPW that attracts the weevils to a point source and kills them. Another ecofriendly management technique is to drench the base of palm fronds with the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium anisopliae, or Beauveria bassiana. An Italian company has developed a microwave collar {{that can be used to}} sterilize individual trees. [...] For early detection of Red Palm Weevil, bioacoustics analysis may be implemented [...] by inserting sensitive microphone into the tree and recording any produced sounds. These sounds are analyzed by digital signal processing and artificial intelligence to decide whether they are generated by Red Palm Weevil.|$|E

Insecticide residues were measured in leaves sampled from the treated plants at four time intervals after treatment to determine the relationship between insecticide concentration and efficacy against two insect pests: sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci Gennadius, and the citrus mealybug, Planococcus citri Risso. The insecticides were evaluated at their respective label rate and at the comparable label rate of the other insecticide under two different light environments: ambient and shade. The uptake of dinotefuran into yellow sage was more rapid at both treatment rates than both rates of imidacloprid, resulting in higher percent mortality of whitefly nymphs (89. 8 – 100) compared with imidacloprid (14. 1 – 89. 2) across all 4 wk. Additionally, plants that received both rates of dinotefuran had fewer whitefly pupae (< 1. 0) at week 4 compared with imidacloprid-treated plants (23. 7 – 25. 3). The uptake of dinotefuran into poinsettia plants was also more rapid and resulted in quicker and higher percent mortality of whitefly nymphs (89. 5 – 99. 6) compared with imidacloprid (14. 1 – 89. 2) across all 4 wk. However, despite efficient uptake, the efficacy of both <b>systemic</b> <b>insecticides</b> was less for citrus mealybug where percent mortality values were < 50 % among all the treatments across the 4 wk.
