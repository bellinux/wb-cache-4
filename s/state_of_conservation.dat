5|$|Before a {{property}} is {{inscribed on the}} List of World Heritage in Danger, its condition is assessed and a potential programme for corrective measures is developed {{in cooperation with the}} State Party involved. The final decision about inscription is made by the committee. Financial support from the World Heritage Fund may be allocated by the committee for listed properties. The <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>conservation</b> is reviewed on a yearly basis, after which the committee may request additional measures, delete the property from the list if the threats have ceased or consider deletion from both the List of World Heritage in Danger and the World Heritage List. Of the two Former UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the Dresden Elbe Valley was delisted after placement on the List of World Heritage in Danger while the Arabian Oryx Sanctuary was directly delisted. As of 2017, there are 54 entries (17 natural, 37 cultural) on the List of World Heritage in Danger. Some sites have been designated as World Heritage Sites and World Heritage in Danger in the same year, such as the Church of the Nativity, traditionally considered to be the birthplace of Jesus. Arranged by the UNESCO regions 22 of the listed sites are located in the Arab States (of which 7 are located in Syria and 5 in Libya), 15 in Africa (of which 5 are in the Democratic Republic of the Congo), 7 in Latin America and the Caribbean, 6 in Asia and the Pacific, and 4 in Europe and North America (all by 2017). The majority of the endangered natural sites (11) are located in Africa.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the effect}} of {{prevailing}} winds and rains on the walls, the mosque has needed several renovations and restoration work which over the years have altered some of its exterior designs. In September 2002, a severe storm destroyed the mihrab and the minaret. As a result, the World Monuments Fund (WMF) placed the mosque on the 2002 World Monuments Watch, also considering the damage sustained after the inappropriate restoration in the 1970s. The Ghana Museums and Monuments Board decided to restore the mosque and sought advice from CRAterre, an architectural firm based in Grenoble, France which has expertise in building earthen structures. The renovation work was supported by a WMF, with a grant fund of US$50,000 from American Express. The local community also provided support. The conservation process involved removal of the earlier cement plaster from the surfaces of the mosque, the wooden structural components were replaced, the minaret and the mihrab were reconstructed, the portal was redone, and the interior and exterior surfaces were plastered in the traditional way. The renovation resulted in reassessing the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>conservation</b> of the site, involving a team of local artisans and labourers. It helped to restore the monument with special emphasis on reviving the knowledge of mud-plaster maintenance.|$|E

25|$|During the Portuguese {{succession}} {{crisis of}} 1580, Diogo Fernandes de Almeida (the alcaide of the castle) took sides with the António, Prior of Crato. On his accession {{to the throne}} of Portugal, Philip I favoured and conceded privileges on municipality of Algoso (1 January 1592), putting the castle authority and noble's allegiance into question. In 1588, though, Friar Gonçalo de Azevedo, a Knight Hospitaller, and son of Diogo Almeida, was nominated by King Philip I, to act as alcaide and commander at the castle. But, this period of interrupted authority would {{have an effect on}} the importance of the fortification. It is unclear of the state of the fortifications during the intervening years, such that by the 17th century, the castle was already abandoned, and the settlement of Algoso took on a larger role in regional authority. On 22 June 1684, the archive of the commandery of Algoso included a description of the furniture and <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>conservation</b> of the castle, but the structures were abandoned and in a state of ruin.|$|E
25|$|The minbar, {{situated}} {{on the right of}} the mihrab, is used by the imam during the Friday or Eids sermons, is a staircase-shaped pulpit with an upper seat, reached by eleven steps, and measuring 3.93 meters length to 3.31 meters in height. Dated from the ninth century (about 862) and erected under the reign of the sixth Aghlabid ruler Abul Ibrahim (856-863), it is made in teak wood imported from India. Among all the pulpits of the Muslim world, it is certainly the oldest example of minbar still preserved today. Probably made by cabinetmakers of Kairouan (some researchers also refer to Baghdad), it consists of an assembly of more than 300 finely carved wood pieces with an exceptional ornamental wealth (vegetal and geometric patterns refer to the Umayyad and Abbasid models), among which about 90 rectangular panels carved with plenty of pine cones, grape leaves, thin and flexible stems, lanceolate fruits and various geometric shapes (squares, diamonds, stars, etc.). The upper edge of the minbar ramp is adorned with a rich and graceful vegetal decoration composed of alternately arranged foliated scrolls, each one containing a spread vine-leaf and a cluster of grapes. In the early twentieth century, the minbar had a painstaking restoration. Although more than eleven centuries of existence, all panels, with the exception of nine, are originals and are in a good <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>conservation,</b> the fineness of the execution of the minbar makes it a great masterpiece of Islamic wood carving referring to Paul Sebag. This old chair of the ninth century is still in its original location, next to the mihrab.|$|E
