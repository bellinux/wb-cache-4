5|$|Tbr1 is {{expressed}} mainly in early-born postmitotic neurons {{of the developing}} cerebral cortex—in particular, the preplate and layer VI neurons. The preplate forms the architectural network of neurons that help developing neurons migrate. Successive migrations of neurons divide the preplate such that its inner cells form the cortical plate while its outer cells form the marginal zone. The cortical plate and the marginal zone eventually develop into six cortical layers, known as the neocortex, present in the mature cerebral cortex. These layers are numbered I-VI with layer VI being the deepest and forming first, while the remaining layers grow outward from it (from V to I). Layers II-VI develop from the cortical plate and layer I forms from the marginal zone. The <b>subplate,</b> intermediate zone, subventricular zone, and ventricular zone are found progressively deeper to these developing cortical layers. High expression of Tbr1 {{is seen in the}} marginal zone, cortical plate, and <b>subplate</b> of the developing cortex whereas little expression is seen in the subventricular zone. No Tbr1 expression has been observed in the ventricular zone.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{suggest that}} the Af9 protein acts as a {{repressor}} of Tbr1 in the upper layers of the six-layer developing cerebral cortex, thereby confining Tbr1 to the lower cortical layers (preplate, <b>subplate,</b> layer VI). This process is regulated through interaction of Af9 with the methyltransferase DOT1L, which methylates histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79). Af9 association with DOT1L enhances methylation of H3K79 at the TBR1 transcription start site, thereby interfering with RNA polymerase II (RNAPolII) activity and reducing TBR1 expression. Mutants of Af9 experience increased dimethylation of H3K79 and increased TBR1 expression.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this {{contract}} was to develop the software to both create and access an on-line database of images from digital scans of the Palomar Sky Survey. This required modifying our DBMS (called Star Base) to create an image database from the actual raw pixel data from the scans. The digitized images are processed into a set of coordinate-reference index and pixel files that are stored in run-length files, thus achieving an efficient lossless compression. For efficiency and ease of referencing, each digitized POSS I plate is then divided into 900 <b>subplates.</b> Our custom DBMS maps each query into the corresponding POSS plate(s) and <b>subplate(s).</b> All images from the appropriate <b>subplates</b> are retrieved from disk with byte-offsets taken from the index files. These are assembled on-the-fly into a GIF image file for browser display, and a FITS format image file for retrieval. The FITS images have a pixel size of 0. 33 arcseconds. The FITS header contains astrometric and photometric information. This method keeps the disk requirements manageable while allowing for future improvements.

However, when dividing the Pacific plate into two <b>subplates</b> separated by what we refer to as the megagash, an east-west low-velocity and low-anisotropy band extending across the Pacific plate from Samoa-Tonga to the Easter–Juan Fernández Islands, the rotation pole of northern Pacific is still in agreement with current plate motion but not the rotation pole of {{the southern part of the}} Pacific, far away from the “classical” rotation pole of the Pacific plate. This result suggests a differential motion between the North and South Pacific and an ongoing reorganization of plates in the Pacific Ocean.

40|$|This paper revisits {{the problem}} of free {{vibration}} of delaminated composite plates with Lévy type boundary conditions. The governing equations are derived for laminated Kirchhoff plates including through-width delamination. The plate {{is divided into two}} <b>subplates</b> in the plane of the delamination. The kinematic continuity of the undelaminated part is established by using the system of exact kinematic conditions. The free vibration analysis of orthotropic simply supported Lévy plates reveals that the delaminated parts are subjected to periodic normal and in-plane shear forces. This effect induces parametric excitation leading to the susceptibility of the plates to dynamic delamination buckling during the vibration. An important aspect is that depending on the vibration mode the internal forces have a two-dimensional distribution in the plane of the delamination. To solve the dynamic stability problem the finite element matrices of the delaminated parts are developed. The distribution of the internal forces {{in the direction of the}} delamination front was considered. The mode shapes including a half-wave along the width of the plate accompanied by delamination buckling are shown based on the subsequent superimposition of the buckling eigenshapes. The analysis reveals that the vibration phenomenon is amplitude dependent. Also, the phase plane portraits are created for some chosen cases showing some special trajectories...|$|R

30|$|Since {{vulnerability}} functions cannot offer {{a complete}} {{answer to the}} question of which areas are more endangered, we run simulations with three distinct seismic scenarios. These simulations exposed building damage patterns at minimum, median, and maximum credible damaging levels. As seen in Fig.  1, the Vrancea intermediate-depth seismic source, located at the contact between the East European Plate and the Intra-Alpine and Moesian <b>Subplates,</b> is the only source responsible for damaging acceleration values in Bucharest. Hazard studies such as those by Giardini et al. (2013) and Pavel et al. (2016) reflect this aspect. Therefore, all selected scenarios are for this source. Two of these scenarios are based on real-recorded values (for the 1990 and 1977 Vrancea earthquakes with moment-magnitudes of 6.9 and 7.4, respectively) and one (for the maximum possible Vrancea earthquake, with moment-magnitude of 7.8) is based on a recent approach relying on nonlinear seismic response evaluation to a synthetic signal from a point source with a mechanism similar to the one of the 1940 earthquake (Marmureanu et al. 2010). These scenarios are deterministic and were selected due to their capability to highlight potential differences inflicted by local site effects and due to their different magnitude ranges, which cover the spectrum between maximum and inceptive damage levels (Toma-Danila and Armaş 2017). All ground motion parameters used are at surface level, and consider site conditions, propagation effects, and frequency ranges, a very important aspect for intermediate-depth Vrancea earthquakes. Probabilistic scenarios for Bucharest do not yet provide sufficient insights into the very local variance of ground motion parameters, which, as demonstrated by previous events, vary considerably both within and between events, and were thus considered unsuitable for reflecting vulnerability patterns, but proved more useful in testing seismic risk dynamics.|$|R
40|$|Enhancement methods applied {{on various}} {{satellite}} images (ASTER, ETM and RADAR SAT- 1) facilitated {{the identification and}} mapping of tectonic fractures in the Zagros fold-and-thrust belt in southwest Iran. The results of the fracture analysis on these enhanced images reveal four principal fracture sets within each fold structure: (i) an axial set defined by normal faults oriented parallel to the fold axial trace, (ii) a cross-axial, extensional fracture set oriented perpendicular to the fold axial trace, (iii) and two sets of intersecting shear fractures, oriented at an acute angle to the cross-axial set. Study of the enhanced images also revealed five fracture sets along the Kazerun fault zone: (i) Riedel R- and R 2 ̆ 7 -shear fracture sets, (ii) extensional T fracture set oriented at a high angle to the trace of the main Kazerun fault, (iii) oblique, synthetic P-shear fracture set, at a low angle to the trace of the main Kazerun fault, and (iv) synthetic Y-shear displacement fracture set, oriented sub-parallel to the main trace of the fault. The estimated mean azimuths of the shortening that developed the fold- and fault-related fracture systems are remarkably close, and are oriented perpendicular to the general NW-SE trend of the Zagros fold-and-thrust belt. The sampling {{and analysis of the}} fold- and fault-related fracture systems were done in a GIS environment. This study shows that an analysis of enhanced satellite images can reveal significant information on the deformation style, timing, and kinematics of the Zagros fold-and-thrust belt.

40|$|The ages of {{magmatic rocks}} are crucial for {{understanding}} of the geodynamic relationships among different magmatic events. Between the compressional Andean and the extensional Atlantic systems, Paraguay has been the site of six main taphrogenic events {{since the end of}} Paleozoic times. Other than the Paraná flood tholeiites (133 - 134 Ma; Early Cretaceous, Hauterivian), new high-precision 40 Ar/ 39 Ar ages show that other alkaline magmatism of various types occurred, namely sodic magmatism at 241. 5 ± 1. 3 Ma (Middle Triassic, Anisian), 118. 3 ± 1. 6 Ma (late Early Cretaceous, Aptian), and 58. 7 ± 2. 4 Ma (Paleocene); and potassic magmatism at 138. 9 ± 0. 7 (Early Cretaceous, Venginian) and 126. 4 ± 0. 4 Ma (Early Cretaceous, Barremian). The main geochemical characteristics of the sodic alkaline rock types are systematic Nb-Ta positive anomalies and Sr-Nd isotopes trending to the bulk Earth or the depleted mantle components, contrasting with potassic rocks and tholeiitic basalts that show negative Nb-Ta anomalies and Sr-Nd isotopes trending to the enriched mantle components. The Pb isotope versus Sr-Nd systematics confirm the distinction between potassic rocks enriched in "high-radiogenic" Sr and low in "less radiogenic" Nd-Pb and sodic rocks ranging from depleted components to bulk Earth and transitional to the Paraná flood tholeiites. The occurrence of alkaline, both sodic and potassic (and carbonatititic), and tholeiitic magmatism in the whole Paraná-Angola-Etendeka system, and even in the Andean system, implies appropriate lithospheric sources to generate the various types of magmatic rocks. Therefore, any hypothesis of an asthenospheric plume origin is not compelling; rather, possibly such a plume provided a thermal perturbation and/or a decompressional environment, and possibly mantle sources were driven by Precambrian melts that contaminated and veined the lithosphere. A decompressional environment is inferred as a possible mechanism driven by differential rotation of different <b>subplates</b> in the South America and south Africa plates...|$|R

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of space geodesy {{over the last}} two decades has had a profound effect on geologic studies by allowing measurements of crustal motion with sub-millimeter per year precision. The focus of this work is to better understand microplate kinematics, intraplate deformation and sea level rise in Europe by use of Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements of crustal deformation. This is accomplished in three separate studies. The first study focuses on crustal motion and sea level rise along the eastern margin of Adria. We use data from tide gauge and continuous GPS (CGPS) stations. We develop a new method to separate common-mode relative sea level from spatially variable signals. From tide gauge data, we find uniform relative sea level rise along the coast that is 2 - 4 times lower than the estimates for global average sea level rise. In constrast, vertical motion of coastal rocks determined by CGPS varies appreciably from an average of - 1. 7 ± 0. 4 mm/yr in the southern Adria to 0. 0 ± 0. 4 mm/yr in northern Adria. The most enigmnatical result of this study is that the combination of tide gauge and CGPS data shows that absolute sea level varies in such a way that relative sea level remains constant. The second study focuses on diffuse intraplate deformation of western Eurasia measured by CGPS. We find that our preferred model involves four <b>subplates,</b> separated by the Pyrenees, Rhine Graben, and Trans European Suture Zone, and yields residual velocities indistinguishable from random samples. We interpret the intraplate dormation as the surface manifestation of downwelling mantle lithosphere. The final component of this work is a study of the Northern and Southern Adria microplates' internal stability and tectonic motion. Results show that both Adria microplates are kinematically distinct from one another and from the slowly converging Eurasia and Nubia plates, with implications for the dynamics of the Nubia-Eurasia plate boundary zone. We also find that internal strain within the Adria microplates is statistically insignificant. We estimate appreciable fault slip rates around the periphery of Adria, with implications for slip rates and seismic hazards associated with circum-Adria fault zones...|$|R
