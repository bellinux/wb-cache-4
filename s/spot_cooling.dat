A particle image velocimeter was used in the research to measure airflow fields for conventional <b>spot</b> <b>cooling</b> and wide-cover type personal air-conditioning (PAC) around the human body. The <b>spot</b> <b>cooling</b> type PAC formed an airflow of 0. 3 – 0. 6 m/s around the area of the neck. However, the wide-cover type PAC formed a calmer airflow field of less than 0. 18 m s 1 around the human body. This is because the supply air from a wide-cover type PAC has a higher density than the surrounding air and can extensively cover the human body. Therefore, the wide-cover type PAC can minimize the potential for cold drafts to affect the human body...|$|E

40|$|Any {{model for}} the {{formation}} of elliptical planetary nebulae (PNs) should account for the positive correlation between the mass loss rate and the degree of departure from sphericity of the AGB progenitor’s wind. I propose that this correlation results from dust formation above magnetic <b>cool</b> <b>spots.</b> The model deals with elliptical PNs, but not with bipolar PNs. The basic assumption is that a weak dynamo amplifies magnetic fields in AGB stars, such that magnetic <b>cool</b> <b>spots</b> are formed, mainly near the equatorial plane. Enhanced dust formation above these <b>cool</b> <b>spots</b> leads to a higher mass loss rate in the equatorial plane, resulting in the formation of an elliptical PN. The dust formation above <b>cool</b> <b>spots</b> becomes much more efficient when mass loss rate is high. In addition to explaining the correlation, the model has the advantage that it can operate for very slowly rotating AGB stars, having rotation velocities of less than 10 − 4 times the break-up velocity. Such velocities can be achieved by a planet companion of mass ∼ 0. 1 MJupiter which spins-up the envelope, or even from singly evolved stars which leave the main sequence with a high rotation velocity. The sporadic nature of magnetic <b>cool</b> <b>spots</b> also leads to the formation of filaments, arcs, and clumps in the descendant PN. The model cannot explain the presence of jets and ansae in elliptical PNs. These are attributed to the destruction of a planet or brown dwarf on the AGB core. – 2 – 1...|$|R

40|$|The Moore's Law {{progression}} in semiconductor technology, including shrinking feature size, increasing transistor density, {{and faster}} circuit speeds, {{is leading to}} increasing total power dissipations and heat fluxes on silicon chip. Moreover, in recent years, increasing performance has resulted in greater non-uniformity of on-chip power dissipation, creating microscale hot spots that can significantly degrade the processor performance and reliability. Application of conventional thermal packaging technology, developed to provide uniform chip cooling, to such chip designs results in lower allowable chip power dissipation or overcooling of {{large areas of the}} chip. Consequently, novel thermoelectric cooler (TEC) has been proposed recently for on-chip hot <b>spot</b> <b>cooling</b> because of its unique ability to selectively cool down the localized microscale hot spot. In this dissertation the potential application of thermoelectric coolers to suppress on-chip hotspots is explored using analytical modeling, numerical simulation, and experimental techniques. Single-crystal silicon is proposed as a potential thermoelectric material due to its high Seebeck coefficient and its thermoelectric cooling performance is investigated using device-level analytical modeling. Integrated on silicon chip as an integral, on-chip thermoelectric cooler, silicon microcooler can effectively reduce the hotspot temperature and its effectiveness is investigated using analytical modeling and numerical simulation, and found to be dependent of doping concentration in silicon, electric contact resistance, hotspot size, hotspot heat flux, die thickness and microcooler size. The other novel on-chip hotspot cooling solution developed in this dissertation is to use a mini-contact enhanced TEC, where the mini-contact pad connects the silicon chip and the TEC to concentrate the thermoelectric cooling power onto a spot of top surface of the silicon chip and therefore significantly improve the hotspot cooling performance. Numerical simulation shows hotspot cooling is determined by thermal contact resistance, thermoelectric element thickness, chip thickness, etc. Package-level experiment demonstrates that <b>spot</b> <b>cooling</b> performance of such mini-contact enhanced TEC can be improved by about 100 %...|$|E
