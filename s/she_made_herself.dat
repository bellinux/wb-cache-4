25|$|Glaum {{began her}} acting career in stock stage productions. She {{was in the}} cast of Crucifixus, a Passion play, which opened on November 12, 1907, at the , 1044 South Hope Street, in Los Angeles, before a good-sized audience. In early June 1908, she {{appeared}} in the Owen Davis play How Baxter Butted In, a melodramatic comedy, at the Los Angeles Theatre on Spring Street. The cast included Lulu Warrenton {{and a number of}} others. Glaum then toured as an ingenue with a road show in Why Girls Leave Home. She earned $25 a week and furnished her own gowns, which <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>herself.</b> After reaching Chicago, she played ingenues in the Imperial Stock Company there {{for a year and a}} half, appearing in The Lion and the Mouse and The Squaw Man, among other plays. While performing in a summer stock engagement in Toledo, she created the ingenue role in Officer 666. Its playwright, Augustin MacHugh, her theatre director in Toledo, tried it out there before Broadway ever saw the successful farce.|$|E
25|$|At the French Open, Hantuchová lost in {{the second}} round in a {{marathon}} match to Harkleroad again, 6–7(2), 6–4, 7–9, making 101 unforced errors, leading to long-time coach Nigel Sears criticising her attitude publicly. Following the match, her extremely thin physique was noticed for the first time publicly, and some wondered about Hantuchová's health. Kicking off the grass season in Eastbourne, Hantuchová {{lost in the}} quarterfinals to Conchita Martínez, but more famously she lost {{in the second round}} of Wimbledon to Shinobu Asagoe, 6–0, 4–6, 10–12, with Hantuchová breaking down crying during the latter stages of the match and making 57 unforced errors. Some theorized that the media's continued interest regarding her weight and the pressure of success at 19 years of age, in addition to her on-court breakdown and her parents' divorce, as well as her coach's walked out during the middle of the match, led to this breakdown. Following Wimbledon, Hantuchová went 6–8 for the rest of the year, 0–4 against top-10 players She ended the year with an overall record of 28–23, and she fell to No. 17 in the world. Further signs of the pressure and problems she was facing during this period was that, in July, <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>herself</b> unavailable for Slovakia in the Fed Cup, in order to concentrate on her singles career, and in November she parted company with Sears.|$|E
60|$|And if he seemed, Grizel went on, with {{momentary}} bitterness, {{to treat}} her badly, it could be only because <b>she</b> had <b>made</b> <b>herself</b> cheap.|$|R
60|$|The {{last two}} remarks <b>she</b> <b>made</b> to <b>herself.</b> Other {{people did not}} always {{appreciate}} her ideas of humour. Sir James never did.|$|R

500|$|As a child, Johansson practiced acting by {{staring in}} the mirror until <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>herself</b> cry, wanting to be Judy Garland in Meet Me in St. Louis. At age seven, she was devastated when a talent agent signed one of her {{brothers}} instead of her, but she later decided to become an actress anyway. She enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, and began auditioning for commercials, but soon lost interest: [...] "I didn't want to promote Wonder Bread." [...] She shifted her focus to film and theater, making her first stage appearance in the Off Broadway play Sophistry with Ethan Hawke, {{in which she had}} only two lines. Around this time, she began studying at Professional Children's School (PCS), a private educational institution for aspiring child actors in Manhattan. At age nine, Johansson made her film debut as John Ritter's daughter in the fantasy comedy North (1994). She remembers being on the set of the film, knowing instinctively what to do. Johansson later played minor roles including as the daughter of Sean Connery and Kate Capshaw's characters in the mystery thriller Just Cause (1995), and an art student in If Lucy Fell (1996).|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between the couple appears at times to have been almost that of a mother and child. Rosebery, a self-centred, reserved man, prone to depression, pessimism and insecurity, had a difficult relationship with his mother who had been distant and openly preferred his younger brother. Lady Rosebery, an orphan and only child, {{appears to have been}} desperate to lavish affection. Once upon entering a book shop she told her children they were entering a toy shop, and when the disappointed children pointed out the obvious she replied [...] "to your father this is a toy shop." [...] Lord Rosebery's friend Edward Hamilton recorded her [...] "notable faculty of getting other people to work and quickening their energies." [...] It seems she was the driving force of the relationship, with her feet firmly on the ground. <b>She</b> <b>made</b> <b>herself</b> the link between the world and her [...] "thin skinned and neurotic" [...] husband. While her husband sulked or withdrew with hurt pride from a situation, she came to the forefront to plead his case or cause. If she was aware of his faults she gave no indication of it.|$|E

Later after she has forgiven him, she calls it a sonic screwdriver.|$|E

60|$|Sophy's next visitor {{came up with}} a manly tread, and {{she almost}} feared that <b>she</b> had <b>made</b> <b>herself</b> ill enough for the doctor; but it was Mr. Ferrars, with a kind face of pitying sympathy.|$|R

6000|$|... "Perhaps. I really don't know." [...] Tasso {{loosened}} her belt. <b>She</b> <b>made</b> <b>herself</b> {{comfortable on}} the cot, unbuttoning her shirt. [...] "You're {{sure you have}} no more cigarettes?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then, indeed, <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>herself</b> {{known by}} a {{powerful}} scream that caused the horrified man to loose his hold and spring up with a torrent of apologies and self-abuse.|$|E

5000|$|It's finally Prom Night. The {{kids are}} {{electric}} with nervous excitement, and Carrie, no less anxious, resolves {{to make the}} most of the evening ("Why Not Me?"). Frantic with worry, Margaret tries to undermine Carrie's confidence ("Stay Here Instead"). Just then, Tommy arrives, and Carrie, looking ravishing in the gown <b>she's</b> <b>made</b> <b>herself,</b> departs with him. Alone, Margaret struggles with fundamentalist scriptures. [...] "She must be sacrificed. Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live." [...] Her duty - however horrific and tragic - is clear ("When There's No One").|$|R
6000|$|The woman neither spat, {{nor did she}} run {{between her}} legs, but yet the witch changed her into a sheep. Then <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>herself</b> look exactly like the woman, and called out to the good man: ...|$|E

60|$|About {{this time}} the anger of Queen Ranavalona against the Christians {{was so great that}} <b>she</b> <b>made</b> <b>herself</b> quite ill, and more than once had to send for her Court Physician, Mark Breezy, to {{prescribe}} for her.|$|E

60|$|<b>She</b> <b>made</b> <b>herself</b> {{comfortable}} in the easy-chair which he had drawn up to the fire. Outside, an unexpectedly cold wind made the sense of warmth doubly pleasant. She unfastened her simple furs and smiled at him a little dolefully.|$|E

60|$|He {{started for}} the door of the dining-room, but she interposed, and a very {{beautiful}} obstacle <b>she</b> <b>made</b> of <b>herself.</b> His left hand went out as if to grip her, then hesitated. He was patently awed by her soft womanhood.|$|R
60|$|This morning, when <b>she</b> had <b>made</b> <b>herself</b> {{smell of}} geraniums, and {{fastened}} all the small contrivances that hold {{even the best}} of women together, she went downstairs to her little dining-room, set the spirit lamp going, and taking up her newspaper, stood waiting to make tea.|$|R
