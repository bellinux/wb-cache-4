40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to explore the role that <b>accounting</b> <b>skills</b> and <b>accounting</b> {{qualifications}} may play in entering fields that have been virtually closed to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander (ATSI) people.

As this is an exploratory study, we have limited our analysis to one key aspect of the Bourdieun framework, namely that of field.

40|$|International audienceThe {{development}} of phonological and orthographic processing was studied {{from the middle}} of Grade 1 to the end of Grade 4 (age 6; 6 - 10 years) using the effects of regularity and of lexicality in reading aloud and in spelling tasks, and using the effect of pseudohomophony in a silent reading task. In all the tasks, signs of reliance on phonological processing were found even when indicators of reliance on orthographic processing appeared. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to determine which early skills predict later reading achievement. Pseudoword and irregular word scores were used as measures for phonological and orthographic skills, respectively. Only middle of Grade 1 phonological reading <b>skills</b> <b>accounted</b> for independent variance in end of Grade 4 orthographic skills. Conversely, from the middle to the end of Grade 1, and from the end of Grade 1 to the end of Grade 4, both orthographic and phonological <b>skills</b> <b>accounted</b> for independent variance in later orthographic skills. In the prediction of phonological skills, only the unique contribution of earlier phonological skills was significant.

To what extent do diferences between African Americans, U.

From analyses of 1991 National Longitudinal Survey (NLSY) data for six groups defined by ethnicity and gender, we found that individual cognitive skill level (as assessed by standardized test scores) affects access to occupations requiring more cognitive skilI, and affects wages levels, even when controlling for education, work experience, and other factors. Most {{of the effect of}} cognitive skills on earnings is direct; a smaller portion is indirect, through access to occupations requiring more cognitive skill. The lower average cognitive skill levels for African Americans and Mexican Americans explain a substantial proportion of the earnings gaps between these groups and European Americans. By contrast, cognitive skills explain none of the gender gap in pay within ethnic groups. We conclude that to understand or alter racial or ethnic inequalities in earnings, scholars and policy-makers must attend to social sources of group diferences in cognitive skills, such as school, family, and neighborhood experiences.

Similar to the gap in reading, pre-school cognitive <b>skills</b> <b>account</b> {{for most of the}} characteristic effect {{in the case of the}} numeracy gap. In contrast, the return effect is positive and statistically significant, suggesting that male students are better able to convert educational inputs into higher numeracy test scores. Since the return effect dominates the characteristic effect, whether at the mean or along the distribution, the total gender numeracy score gap is positive, suggesting that male students outperform female students in numeracy. However, consistent with the regression results from regression model 1, estimates of the total gap are statistically significant in grades 5 and 7 only. Panel B in Fig.  2 additionally shows that at grades 5 and 7, the characteristic effect line diverts from the zero horizontal line along the test score distribution (i.e. the effect is more negative), suggesting that female students at the higher end of the distribution possess more of the characteristics associated with higher numeracy scores. In addition, the return effect line diverts from the zero horizontal line along the test score distribution, indicating that male students at the higher end of the distribution are more efficient in transforming education inputs into higher numeracy test scores. The combination of these two opposite trends explains the widening gender numeracy test score gap in favour of male students along the distribution.|$|E

This study views failure and problems experienced by the sojourner {{as a result of}} lack of the necessary new social skills and knowledge. Social networks, particularly friendships, are thus extremely important in that such networks are not only source of social support, but also major channels through which such skills and knowledge are acquired. Guided by social support theories and social skills theories, this study examines the following research questions through the survey and the interview with a sample of Chinese students at Northwest University I and five other universities across the United States. 1. How is adjustment of Chinese students related to their friendship patterns? 2. What are the friendship patterns of Chinese students? 3. What are the primary functions of the friendship patterns of Chinese students? 4.

How is social adjustment related to the degree of difficulty felt by Chinese students in different social situations? Some additional questions related to the five research questions were also addressed in this study. The study showed there were different functions for different friendship patterns among Chinese students.

This research examines the current conditions in the promotion of <b>skills</b> development <b>accounts,</b> and suggests future improvements. The research details and methods are as follows. First, the current status and performance were identified through an analysis of statistical data released by the Ministry of Employment and Labor, and HRD-Net data. Second, case studies for Germany and the U. S. were conducted with regard to the evaluation of training courses and the assessment of training institutions. Third, professional conferences were held, in which officials of the Ministry of Employment and Labor, and Job Centers, experts, and training institutions participated. Fourth, interviews with those involved in training institutions were conducted to identify the problems related to the quality of training. Based on the analysis, suggestions for future improvements were made as follows, beginning with the aspect of the trainees. First, raising the level of expenses borne by trainees who participate in training provided by training institutions to which the government has given poor ratings can be a mechanism {{to improve the quality of}} vocational training services. Second, a possible alternative to facilitate trainee awareness that the <b>skills</b> development <b>account</b> is their right is to impose a lifetime ceiling on training cost as is done in the U. S., rather than supporting training without limitation as in the current system. Third, though a trainee selection system is being prepared, such as reinforcing Commission for Account Issuance, further strengthening of standards for <b>skills</b> development <b>account</b> issuance is required to select trainees aiming at employment. It is also necessary to operate <b>skills</b> development <b>accounts</b> as a program not for all unemployed, but for the long-term unemployed for 3 ～ 6 months after registering for employment, or to selectively operate the system targeting those who are not employed. Fourth, it is known many participants pursue a kind of ‘training shopping’, and some of these participants do not complete the training. Therefore, it may be necessary to reduce the limit cost of <b>skills</b> development <b>accounts</b> and restrict training courses. The next point is related to training institutions and training courses. First, the motivation of training institutions to prepare quality management systems needs to be reinforced. For example, it is necessary to introduce an incentive program in which additional points are given to the training institutions that adopt a quality management system such as ISO. Second, it is necessary to allow only those training institutions with certain evaluation ratings to open training courses using <b>skills</b> development <b>accounts.</b> Third, employment rate and employment retention rate should be reflected in the evaluation of the suitability of training courses for <b>skills</b> development <b>accounts,</b> in order to encourage training institutions to pursue best practices as they face increasing difficulties in guidance, management and supervision due to the expansion in the number of training institutions and courses. Fourth, suitable training courses for <b>skills</b> development <b>accounts</b> should be acknowledged according to the demand of the labor market. Fifth, the method of evaluating the suitability of training courses for <b>skills</b> development <b>accounts</b> needs to shift from the current centralized approach to an approach focusing on local employment centers. Sixth, to activate the education and training market through the co-existence of training financially supported by the government and general paid training, it is necessary to reflect the capability of conducting general paid training in the evaluation of the suitability of training courses for <b>skills</b> development <b>accounts.</b> Seventh, it is critical to introduce minimum standards in order to provide counseling for trainees in evaluating the suitability of training courses for <b>skills</b> development <b>accounts,</b> and to increase the weight of employment performance and trainee counseling in assessing training institutions. The final point is related to the government. First, the utilization of records management needs to be enhanced. Training records of <b>skills</b> development <b>accounts</b> is managed in the Human Resource Development Training Information Network(HRD-net) of the Ministry of Employment and Labor. The utilization of the records needs to be reinforced, as those records can be an important basic background for r？sum？sto be submitted to companies, as well as training records that are utilized in foreign countries. Second, it is necessary to examine the introduction of training accreditation to improve the prior evaluation and assessment of the suitability of training courses for <b>skills</b> development <b>accounts.</b> 2008 년부터 시작된 직업능력개발계좌제의 당초 정책목표를 달성하면서 제도를 안착시키기 위해서는 직업능력개발계좌제를 둘러싼 각종 문제점들에 대한 개선이 지속적으로 이루어져야 할 필요가 있다. 이 연구에서는 지금까지의 직업능력개발계좌제 추진과정에서 나타나고 있는 현황들을 살펴보면서, 향후 전반적인 개선방향들을 제시하고자 한다. 정부의 훈련품질 제고 관련 주요 정책수단인 적합훈련과정의 심사 및 개설 현황에 대한 분석, 기존의 훈련기관 평가현황 분석, 외국의 훈련품질 제고 관련 사례 분석을 중심으로 계좌제의 성공을 좌우하게 되는 직업훈련의 품질개선을 위한 정책방안을 중점적으로 제시하고자 한다. ○ 주요내용 - 훈련참여 및 수료, 취업 등 직업능력개발계좌제의 추진현황 분석 - 자기부담률 조정에 따른 훈련수요의 변화 및 훈련참여자 의사 분석 - 훈련과정 심사 및 훈련기관 평가 사례 분석 - 외국 바우처제도의 품질관리 사례 분석 - 개선 방안요 약 제 1 장 서론 제 1 절 연구의 필요성 및 목적 1 제 2 절 연구내용 및 연구방법 3 제 3 절 연구범위 4 제 2 장 직업능력개발계좌제 추진현황 제 1 절 추진실적현황 7 1. 예산집행 8 2. 계좌발급 및 훈련실적 9 제 2 절 자부담비율 조정 관련 사례 및 의견조사결과 16 1. 근로자자율적능력개발제도 사례(2005 ～ 2008 년) 검토 16 2. 자부담비율 조정 관련 훈련생 의견조사결과 35 제 3 절 소결 42 제 3 장 직업능력개발계좌제 훈련 참여와 취업실태 제 1 절 분석 개요 45 제 2 절 계좌발급과 훈련참여 49 1. 계좌발급자 추이(’ 08. 9 ～’ 10. 5) 49 2. 3 개월 훈련참여율과 첫 훈련까지의 기간(’ 08. 9 ～’ 10. 2) 54 제 3 절 훈련 이수와 취업 59 1. 훈련참여율과 순훈련수료율 59 2. 계좌발급 후 첫 훈련참여까지의 기간 64 3. 훈련횟수 67 4. 취업률 70 제 4 절 소결 74 제 4 장 직업능력개발계좌제 품질관리제도 현황 제 1 절 적합훈련과정 심사제도 77 1. 심사절차와 심사기준 77 2. 심사결과 개요 92 3. 심사의 문제와 개선방안 94 제 2 절 훈련기관 평가제도 97 1. 계좌제 훈련기관과 훈련기관 평가 97 2. 계좌제 훈련기관 평가 101 제 3 절 소결 107 1. 요약 107 2. 시사점과 개선방안 109 제 5 장 외국 바우처제도의 품질관리제도 사례 제 1 절 외국의 훈련품질관리 개관 113 제 2 절 독일의 품질관리 사례 116 1. 직업교육훈련품질 논의의 역사와 계좌제 훈련 품질관리체제의특성 116 2. 공급측 품질관리 124 4. 수요측 품질관리 138 5. 요약 144 제 3 절 미국의 품질관리 사례 147 1. 훈련생 선발: 훈련적격자 판단 147 2. 훈련기관 관리 및 훈련비 150 3. 지역별 적합직업훈련과정 선정 153 4. 적합훈련과정 선정 시 노동시장성과 관련기준 159 제 4 절 소결 161 제 6 장 논의 및 개선방안 제 1 절 훈련생 관련 166 제 2 절 훈련기관 및 훈련과정 관련 168 제 3 절 정부 관련 170 SUMMARY 173 직업능력개발계좌제 직업훈련참여자 설문조사지 179 제 3 장의 상세표 183 참고문헌 18...|$|R
