Experiments were carried out from September 2005 to July 2007, using 25 pitfall traps baited with food grade oil and pheromone specific for Sitophilus spp. The traps were observed weekly and the insects were identified and counted. Several species were found but Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky and S. oryzae (L.) were the most abundant (90 % of the total) followed by Tribolium castaneum (Herbst). Taylor’s power law parameters, from the regression of log variance versus log mean, suggest an aggregated distribution for Sitophilus spp. and T. castaneum.

40|$|ABSTRACT Among the pests of citrus, one of {{the most}} {{important}} is the red and black flat mite Brevipalpus phoenicis (Geijskes), which transmits the Citrus leprosis virus C (CiLV-C). When a rational pest control plan is adopted, it is important to determine the correct timing for carrying out the control plan. Making this decision demands constant follow-up of the culture through periodic sampling where knowledge about the spatial distribution of the pest is a fundamental part to improve sampling and control decisions. The objective of this work was to study the spatial distribution pattern and build a <b>sequential</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> for the pest. The data used were gathered from two blocks of Valencia sweet orange on a farm in São Paulo State, Brazil, by 40 inspectors trained for the data collection. The following aggregation indices were calculated: variance/ mean ratio, Morisita index, Green’s coefficient, and k parameter of the negative binomial distribution. The data were tested for fit with Poisson and negative binomial distributions using the chi-square goodness of fit test. The sequential sampling was developed using Wald’s Sequential Probability Ratio Test and validated through simulations.

40|$|Western bean cutworm, Striacosta albicosta (Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is {{a native}} pest of dry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and corn (Zea mays L.), and {{historically}} distributed in the western United States.

The species is univoltine, the adults typically emerge {{in the middle of}} July, lay eggs on corn leaves, and the larvae feed on different corn tissues. In the fourth instar, larvae start colonization of the ear where they feed on kernels. There is a narrow window for management and early detection of the pest in the field is essential. Larval feeding and dispersal of early larval instar studies of western bean cutworm are necessary to improve the understanding about how feeding requirements affect larval survival and establishment on the corn plant. A refinement of economic injury levels (EIL) and economic thresholds (ET) are also required for management decision-making. Studies during 2008 – 2011, across three ecoregions of Nebraska, had the following objectives: (1) developing a binomial <b>sequential</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> for egg masses, (2) determine the feeding behavior and dispersal of the early instars on corn, and (3) development of EILs and the ETs that incorporate the dynamics of corn price, management cost, and pest survival.

The sorghum panicle caterpillar complex consists of larvae of two polyphagous lepidopteran species: the corn earworm, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), and fall armyworm, Spodoptera frugiperda (J. E.

Sampling for panicle caterpillars in sorghum fields is usually accomplished by the beat bucket sampling technique with a fixed {{sample size of}} 30 beat bucket samples of one sorghum panicle each per 16. 2 ha of field.

Panicle caterpillars had an aggregated distribution of counts confirmed by Pearson's chi-square statistic for lack of fit to the negative binomial distribution for each sampled field. A <b>sequential</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>plan</b> was developed using a high threshold (an economic threshold) of 0. 5 caterpillars per sorghum panicle, a low threshold (a safe level) of 0. 20 caterpillars per panicle, and fixed error rates (α = 0. 10 and β = 0. 05).

For whichever type of <b>sampling</b> <b>plan,</b> single, double, multiple or sequential, it is sufficient to determine the form of the first function mentioned in the opening paragraph and the OC function, to express the remaining functions. Some examples are provided to clarify the proposed procedure. Of particular importance is the application in the case of <b>sequential</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> where, through the use of some results related to random walks with two absorbing barriers, it is possible to obtain approximate expressions of all the above functions...|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of Aphis glycines Matsumura was studied. All sets of samples exhibited aggregated patterns of {{spatial distribution}}, but did not fit Poisson, Neymann (n= 0 ? 4 and ?), Poisson-binomial and compound Poisson distributions. Of 11 sets of samples tested, 10 sets fitted the negative binomial distribution; only 1 set did not fit. The fundamental components of the spatial distributions of Aphis glycines are aggregated distribution of individual populations; the degrees of aggregation increase with the population densities. The spatial distribution parameters (? m, C?, ? I, x m ?,?,?) of the soybean aphids and species aggregation average degree (?) were analyzed, the reason of aggregation patterns of the aphids was discussed, and {{the relation between the}} average sizes of the individual population and its average densities was predicted. The theoretical sizes of <b>sampling</b> and <b>sequential</b> <b>sampling</b> <b>plans</b> of fixed levels with precision were determined by utilizing estimated variance/mean relationship obtained from Taylor’s power law regression. The theoretical size of sampling is 2 0. 64 5. 364 D x n ? ? and the stop line of fixed-precision-level <b>sequential</b> <b>sampling</b> is 3. 125 0. 563 * 13. 8 D n T n ?.
