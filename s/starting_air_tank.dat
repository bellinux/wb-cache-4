50|$|The Type 93 torpedo had a main chamber {{filled with}} pure {{compressed}} oxygen, a joint regulator valve preventing reverse flow, {{and a small}} (approximately 13-liter) high-pressure <b>air</b> <b>tank.</b> First, compressed <b>air</b> was mixed with fuel, and the mixture was supplied to a heat starter. Ignition started gently, with the mixture burning steadily in the engine (if oxygen was used at this stage, explosions were common). As the compressed air was consumed and lost pressure, high-pressure oxygen was supplied from the main chamber through the joint valve into the compressed <b>air</b> <b>tank.</b> Soon the <b>air</b> <b>tank</b> was filled with pure oxygen, and combustion continued in the engine.|$|R
50|$|The primary {{disadvantages}} of the shotgun starter are {{the need to}} keep a stock of cartridges, one of which is used for each attempt to start, and the short time that the motor is spun by each cartridge. Compressed-air starters, which use the same type of motor, are usually recharged by an engine-driven compressor, negating the need to carry cartridges, but adding requirements for the compressor and <b>air</b> <b>tank.</b> Hybrid systems can be made simply by adding a cartridge breech or an <b>air</b> <b>tank</b> to an existing system. <b>Air</b> <b>tanks</b> can also be recharged from an external source in an emergency, such as a hand pump or a portable air compressor.|$|R
