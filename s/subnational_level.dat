25|$|Due to {{the history}} of Germany, the {{principle}} of federalism is strong. Only the state of Hitler (1933–1945) and the state of the communists (East Germany, 1949–1990) were centralist states. As a result, the words Reich and Bund used more frequently than in other countries, in order to distinguish between imperial or federal institutions and those at a <b>subnational</b> <b>level.</b> For example, a modern federal German minister is called Bundesminister, in contrast to a Landesminister who holds office in a state such as Rhineland-Palatinate or Lower Saxony.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: One Health (OH) can be {{considered}} a complex emerging policy to resolve health issues at the animal–human and environmental interface. It is expected to drive system changes in terms of new formal and informal institutional and organisational arrangements. This study, using Rift Valley fever (RVF) as a zoonotic problem requiring an OH approach, sought to understand the institutionalisation process at national and <b>subnational</b> <b>levels</b> in an early adopting country, Kenya. Materials and methods: Social network analysis methodologies were used. Stakeholder roles and relational data were collected at national and <b>subnational</b> <b>levels</b> in 2012. Key informants from stakeholder organisations were interviewed, guided by a checklist. Public sector animal and public health organisations were interviewed first to identify other stakeholders with whom they had financial, information sharing and joint cooperation relationships. Visualisation of the OH social network and relationships were shown in sociograms and mathematical (degree and centrality) characteristics of the network summarised. Results and discussion: Thirty-two and 20 stakeholders relevant to OH were identified at national and <b>subnational</b> <b>levels,</b> respectively. Their roles spanned wildlife, livestock, and public health sectors as well as weather prediction. About 50 % of national-level stakeholders had made significant progress on OH institutionalisation to an extent that formal coordination structures (zoonoses disease unit and a technical working group) had been created. However, the process had not trickled down to <b>subnational</b> <b>levels</b> although cross-sectoral and sectoral collaborations were identified. The overall binary social network density for the stakeholders showed that 35 and 21 % of the possible ties between the RVF and OH stakeholders existed at national and <b>subnational</b> <b>levels,</b> respectively, while public health actors’ collaborations were identified at community/grassroots level. We recommend extending the OH network to include the other 50 % stakeholders and fostering of the process at subnational-level building on available cross-sectoral platforms...|$|R

Bertrana and Heinelt described the Papandreou government's decision as using a singular window of opportunity to overcome long-standing resistance against reform. While in regard to the massive-scale top-down approach deviating from a Southern European strategy, compared to federal states such as Germany, interaction between national and <b>subnational</b> <b>levels</b> remains relatively weak with the <b>subnational</b> <b>levels</b> remaining strictly separated from the deconcentrated administration of the central government.

40|$|Background: Recent {{assessments}} show continued {{decline in}} child mortality in Papua New Guinea (PNG), yet complete subnational analyses remain rare. This study aims to estimate under-five mortality in PNG at national and <b>subnational</b> <b>levels</b> {{to examine the}} importance of geographical inequities in health outcomes and track progress towards Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 4. Methodology: We performed retrospective data validation of the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) 2006 using 2000 Census data, then applied advanced indirect methods to estimate under-five mortality rates between 1976 and 2000. Findings: The DHS 2006 {{was found to be}} unreliable. Hence we used the 2000 Census to estimate under-five mortality rates at national and <b>subnational</b> <b>levels.</b> During the period under study, PNG experienced a slow reduction in national under-five mortality from approximately 103 to 78 deaths per 1, 000 live births. Subnational analyses revealed significant disparities between rural and urban populations as well as inter- and intra-regional variations. Some of the provinces that performed the best (worst) in terms of under-five mortality included the districts that performed worst (best), with district-level under-five mortality rates correlating strongly with poverty levels and access to services. Conclusions: The evidence from PNG demonstrates substantial within-province heterogeneity, suggesting that under-five mortality needs to be addressed at <b>subnational</b> <b>levels.</b> This is especially relevant in countries, like PNG, where responsibilit...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{cross-country}} {{data for}} up to 78 countries, this paper shows that fiscal decentralization-the assignment of expenditure and revenue mobilization functions to <b>subnational</b> <b>levels</b> of government-is associated with various indicators of governance, such as corruption, rule of law, and government effectiveness. Unlike previous studies in the decentralization/governance literature, which focus primarily on expenditure-based measures of decentralization, the results reported in this paper show {{that the relationship between}} decentralization and governance depends on how subnational expenditures are financed. The higher the share in total subnational revenues of nontax revenues and grants and transfers from higher levels of government, the stronger the association between decentralization and governance.

50|$|Federalism, {{and other}} forms of {{territorial}} autonomy, is generally seen as a useful way to structure political systems in order to prevent violence among different groups within countries because it allows certain groups to legislate at the <b>subnational</b> <b>level.</b> Some scholars have suggested, however, that federalism can divide countries and result in state collapse because it creates proto-states. Still others have shown that federalism is only divisive when it lacks mechanisms that encourage political parties to compete across regional boundaries.|$|E
