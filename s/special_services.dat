5|$|Following the Second World War, service levels dropped {{dramatically}} along the Portishead branch. When the railways were nationalised in 1948, services at Parson Street {{came under the}} auspices of the Western Region of British Railways, and by the time the branch was closed to passengers in 1964, there were only six trains each weekday, and none on Sundays. With the closure of the branch, Parson Street lost its interchange status, and in January 1971 the station buildings were demolished. Some <b>special</b> <b>services</b> did continue along the branch to , carrying fans to Bristol City FC games at the nearby Ashton Gate Stadium. These ceased in 1977, and Parson Street became the arrival and departure point for these trains.|$|E
5|$|For the post-Fleming {{continuation}} Bond authors, Leiter {{has also}} {{appeared on a}} periodic basis. After John Gardner took over writing the James Bond novel series, Leiter made an occasional appearance and the novel For <b>Special</b> <b>Services</b> introduces his daughter, Cedar Leiter, {{who is also a}} CIA officer (and briefly Bond's romantic conquest). Raymond Benson also included Leiter's character in some of his novels, including The Facts of Death and Doubleshot. Similarly the more recent continuation Bond novels—the 2008 Sebastian Faulks novel Devil May Care and the 2011 novel Carte Blanche by Jeffery Deaver—both contained the character.|$|E

5|$|In 1989 the centenary of {{the branch}} saw a revival of {{interest}} in the line. Over the weekends of 1–2 and 8–9 July <b>special</b> <b>services</b> were run between Watford and Chesham, using two preserved Metropolitan Railway steam locomotives and a former MR electric locomotive. The service was a great success, with over 9,000 people travelling on the trains and large numbers of people travelling to the area to watch the trains. The success prompted LT to repeat the Steam on the Met event annually until 2000, although often running to Amersham rather than Chesham.|$|E

As a part of this organisation, the unit's name was changed to 'A' <b>Special</b> <b>Service</b> Company. At the end of 1940, the <b>special</b> <b>service</b> battalions were reorganised into a headquarters and two Commandos {{and the name of the}} unit reverted to No. 3 Commando.

5|$|The divorce {{meant that}} Skelton {{had lost his}} married man's deferment; he was once again {{classified}} as 1-A for service. He was drafted into the army in early 1944; both MGM and his radio sponsor tried to obtain a deferment for the comedian, but to no avail. His last Raleigh radio show was on June 6, 1944, {{the day before he}} was formally inducted as a private; he was not assigned to <b>Special</b> <b>Services</b> at that time. Without its star, the program was discontinued, and the opportunity presented itself for the Nelsons to begin a radio show of their own, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet.|$|E
5|$|The {{heyday of}} the line was between 1923, when the GCR was absorbed into the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) and 1948, when the LNER was nationalised to form the British Rail Eastern Region. As a result, many prestigious locomotives, such as Flying Scotsman, Sir Nigel Gresley, and Mallard which ran on the East Coast Main Line, were {{frequent}} visitors to the line. Special trains ran {{on the line to}} destinations such as Scotland. The station's busiest use came after the construction of Wembley Stadium in 1923, when it was used to contain large crowds wishing to see the FA Cup Final. <b>Special</b> <b>services</b> ran from Marylebone to the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Park the following year.|$|E

5|$|Benbow {{continued}} {{aboard the}} Sovereign throughout 1691, {{and by the}} summer of 1692, was again master of the fleet, this time under Admiral Edward Russell, then aboard the Britannia. Benbow worked closely with his old colleague David Mitchell, then serving as Russell's first captain, and Josiah Burchett, Russell's clerk. Benbow may have advised Russell to take the Gull Passage inside the Goodwin Sands to the Downs, where they linked up with the Dutch forces. Benbow served as master of the fleet during the Battles of Barfleur and La Hogue. After the battles, Benbow returned to Deptford to resume his duties as master attendant, spending a brief period at Portsmouth Dockyard helping to oversee repairs to the fleet. He had already had his pay upgraded to that of a master attendant, he was now to be paid as a master, in addition to his master attendant's wage, presumably as an acknowledgement of his <b>special</b> <b>services.</b>|$|E
5|$|By now the Commandos {{started to}} move away from smaller raiding operations. They were formed into four brigades to {{spearhead}} future Allied landing operations. The previous Special Service Brigade Headquarters was replaced by Headquarters <b>Special</b> <b>Services</b> Group under command of Major General Robert Sturges. Of the remaining 20 Commando units, 17 were used {{in the formation of the}} four Special Service brigades. The three remaining Commandos (Nos. 12, 14, and 62) were left out of the brigade structure to concentrate on smaller scale raids. The increased tempo of operations, together with a shortage of volunteers and the need to provide replacements for casualties, forced their disbandment by the end of 1943. The small scale raiding role was then given to the two French troops of No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando.|$|E
5|$|Goods {{traffic was}} more substantial, with fruit, hops and timber being sent out and coal being received. The 1937 {{timetable}} showed two down freight workings from Paddock Wood and one conditional working for Goudhurst, {{while in the}} other direction two conditional workings ran from Hawkhurst and one from Goudhurst. These were market trains and carried wagons for Blackfriars Goods attached to freight services at Paddock Wood. The volume of goods carried fell into steep decline after the Second World War as more and more freight was taken to market by road. Coal traffic remained constant as did the transport of pot plants from local nurseries at Flimwell and Wadhurst for F W Woolworth. This was an important source of revenue for the line with one million pot plants a year being transported from Hawkhurst, bringing in around £1,000 per week. Up to four parcels and miscellaneous vans were loaded daily at Hawkhurst and attached to the last train to Tonbridge, with further collections possibly being made at Horsmonden; <b>special</b> <b>services</b> were laid on in the busy period before Mothering Sunday.|$|E

The <b>Special</b> <b>Service</b> Force constituted a unique chapter in Canada's military history. It derived {{its name from the}} first <b>Special</b> <b>Service</b> Force, an historic formation of Americans and Canadians which pioneered special forces operations in a brief but immensely successful history during the second world war. The latter-day <b>Special</b> <b>Service</b> Force represented a compromise between the general purpose combat capabilities of a normal brigade and the strategic and tactical flexibility which derived from the lighter and more mobile capabilities of the Canadian Airborne Regiment.

5|$|Carter J. Burke (Paul Reiser) {{is special}} {{projects}} director of Weyland-Yutani Corporation's <b>Special</b> <b>Services</b> Division {{and the primary}} antagonist of Aliens. After telling Ellen Ripley about her daughter's death and hearing her account of the Nostromo incident, Burke uses the information to have LV-426's colonists rendezvous with the Derelict and trigger an Alien outbreak. He persuades her to join the Colonial marine expedition, to destroy (not extract) specimens, as an adviser in exchange for her regaining her flight license. Burke accompanies the squad aboard Sulaco to safeguard the company's investment in the terraforming colony. His ulterior motives are discovered by Ripley; his rationale is that the Aliens are an important species they cannot exterminate and the facility is a significant investment. Burke tries to have Ripley and Newt impregnated by imprisoned facehuggers, but the Colonial Marines intervene. Although most of the survivors press for Burke's execution, Ripley protests; the Aliens cut the power and use an architectural-design flaw {{to break into the}} room. He escapes, leaving {{the rest of the group}} to die, but is confronted by an Alien in the locked medical lab and his screams are heard by those outside.|$|E
