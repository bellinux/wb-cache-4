5000|$|In early 1975, {{the record}} company, {{tired of waiting}} for the new album, [...] "confiscated" [...] {{material}} from Marriott's Clear Sounds Studio, but much of the material was not meant for Pie, it was for a solo album and for his on-going project with Ridley. To make the best of a bad situation, A&M brought in Andrew Loog Oldham to mix and cut up the tracks and make them heavier, much to the disgust of Marriott. The title <b>Street</b> <b>Rats</b> was also thought up by A&M. Not surprisingly the band were never happy with the album, with Greg Ridley stating: [...] "It was terrible". Clem Clempson elaborated on this. [...] "The mixes were done by someone outside the band, Oldham, and when we heard it we were horrified". Steve Marriott (1975): [...] " [...] "Street Rats" [...] was a track with me, Ian Wallace and Tim Hinkley playing piano, It was nothing to do with Humble Pie".

50|$|Usually {{the hero}} or heroine {{of the film}} {{undergoes}} a transformation (e.g. Aladdin goes from <b>street</b> <b>rat</b> to prince, Cinderella from servant to princess). In Frozen, Hans goes from a courtly charmer to power-hungry villain. According to Hyrum Osmond, one of the supervising animators for Hans, Hans initially appears as a handsome, dashing character. The crew wanted the audience {{to fall in love}} with him and the relationship he could have with Anna. Then they'd got to turn him around towards the climax and make it a big shock. According to Lino Di Salvo, Hans is a chameleon who adapts to any environment to make the other characters comfortable. And one of the biggest challenges in designing Hans, according to Bill Schwab, character design supervisor, was to make sure that they covered all aspects of his personality without fully tipping their hand to the audience. He shares similar personalities with various Disney villains: Notably, Lady Tremaine for the way he treats Anna near the climax of the end. He shares Ratigan from The Great Mouse Detective, Frollo from The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Scar from The Lion King, and Jafar's from Aladdin, intentions for wanting to murder their respective rulers and instill themselves as king (which only Ratigan, Frollo and Hans was able to almost fulfill, while Jafar decided he would force Jasmine to marry him and not kill her. On the other hand, Scar had succeeded in killing Mufasa and taking over as king until he was finally foiled by Simba who forced his confession during their fight). He shares similarities to Gaston from Beauty and the Beast in which they were the youngest villains to appear and having the towns fall in love with them. However, the main difference is that Belle quickly saw Gaston for who he is and distrusted him, whereas Hans gained Anna's trust before betraying her. Afterwards, he left a lasting and negative impact on Anna when she realizes that the warning Elsa, and later Kristoff, originally gave her about falling in love with someone she does not know was true.|$|E

Fol-lowing a brief introduction to the research context—an inquiry into the life experiences of homeless youth travelers—the author presents a poem that interweaves snippets of conversations audiotaped during the inquiry with lines of poetry that she has written in her reflections about the research process and with poetry written by a 17 -year-old female traveler.
