5|$|Although Jews are an ethnoreligious group, {{they were}} {{defined by the}} Nazis on purely racial grounds.

Defining Jews as the chief enemy, Nazi racial ideology was also used to persecute other minorities.|$|E
5|$|Female taiko {{performance}} has {{also served as}} a response to gendered <b>stereotypes</b> <b>of</b> Japanese women as being quiet, subservient, or a femme fatale.

40|$|Media sexual <b>stereotyping</b> <b>of</b> {{the nursing}} {{profession}} is a well-recognized phenomenon; however the sexual <b>stereotyping</b> <b>of</b> {{the image of}} the nurse by the sex/pornography industry is a much less publicized or discussed phenomenon within the nursing profession. This paper aims to examine the presentation <b>of</b> the sexual <b>stereotyping</b> <b>of</b> nurses by newspapers and the sex/pornography industry. Both national and local newspapers in the UK frequently use derrogatory terminology to depict the sexual <b>stereotyping</b> <b>of</b> nurses. Images and sexual <b>stereotyping</b> <b>of</b> nursing by the sex industry is also noted. The media was found to emphasize both positive and negative nursing stereotypes and in comparison with other occupations and professions sexual stereotyping was prevalent. The utilization of nursing imagery is also significantly visible across a wide range of pornographic and sex industry material...|$|R
40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to explore {{the effects of the}} sociopolitical ideologies colorblindness and multiculturalism on perceivers’ (1) automatic awareness of race and (2) automatic racial stereotyping. Study 1 showed that a colorblind prime caused White perceivers to notice White targets’ race more compared to a no prime condition, although non-White perceivers were able to ignore race when primed with colorblindness. Multiculturalism, on the other hand, caused individuals to notice race no differently than the control. In terms <b>of</b> <b>stereotyping,</b> Study 2 showed that a colorblind prime did not change automatic <b>stereotyping</b> <b>of</b> Black or White targets. In contrast, multiculturalism increased automatic positive <b>stereotyping</b> <b>of</b> Black targets compared to the control condition, but did not affect <b>stereotyping</b> <b>of</b> White targets. Implications discussed include why colorblindness might affect White and non-White perceivers differently as well as whether or not decreased positive <b>stereotyping</b> <b>of</b> Whites (in the case of colorblindness) and increased positive <b>stereotyping</b> <b>of</b> both Blacks (in the case of multiculturalism) are beneficial ways to attain national unity...|$|R
5000|$|Many psychologists {{argue that}} the {{cultural}} <b>stereotype</b> <b>of</b> black criminality can have an unconscious but substantial influence on the way that [...] "people perceive individuals, process information, and form judgments". For example, the criminal <b>stereotype</b> <b>of</b> African Americans could contribute to the reason behind why blacks are disproportionately more likely than Whites to be targeted by the police as suspects, interrogated and wrongfully convicted. The <b>stereotype</b> <b>of</b> a criminal African American has also been associated with racial profiling.|$|R

In an earlier interview in 2000, Yao said he had never seen a fortune cookie in China and guessed it must have been an American invention.|$|E
5|$|In interviews, Colbert has {{described}} his parents as devout people who also strongly valued intellectualism and taught their children {{that it was}} possible to question the church and still be Catholic.

5|$|Like Mr. Krabs, Pearl {{has also}} been {{considered}} a stereotyped character; Sharon Lamb and Lyn Mikel Brown wrote in their 2007 book Packaging Girlhood that Pearl exhibits the traits of an archetypal girly girl.

5|$|A Fistful of Dollars {{proved a}} {{landmark}} {{in the development}} of spaghetti Westerns, with Leone depicting a more lawless and desolate world than traditional westerns, and challenging American <b>stereotypes</b> <b>of</b> a western hero with a morally ambiguous antihero. The film's success made Eastwood a major star in Italy and he was re-hired to star in For a Few Dollars More (1965), the second of the trilogy. Through the efforts of screenwriter Luciano Vincenzoni, the rights to For a Few Dollars More and the final film of the trilogy (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) were sold to United Artists for about $900,000.|$|E

5|$|Juan Leyrado {{played a}} {{grandfather}} {{for the first}} time in his career. Unlike the usual telenovela grandfather (a secondary character), his character has a prominent role and his own story arcs. Leyrado, who was 60 years old when the series was made, said that he was still active in his personal life and played the character according to his own experiences. Korean-Argentine Chang Kim Sung, who played Walter Mao, said he was proud that his character did not conform to <b>stereotypes</b> <b>of</b> Asian people.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scenes in}} the film portray demon-like and other fictional creatures {{as part of the}} Persian army, and the fictionalized {{portrayal}} of Persian King Xerxes I has been criticized as effeminate. Critics suggested that this was meant to stand {{in stark contrast to the}} sheer masculinity of the Spartan army. Steven Rea argued that the film's Persians were a vehicle for an anachronistic cross-section of Western <b>stereotypes</b> <b>of</b> Asian and African cultures.|$|E
5|$|Biographer Andrew Morton {{noted that}} most of Madonna's admirers were females, who were born-and-brought-up with an image of old-fashioned <b>stereotypes</b> <b>of</b> women as {{virginal}} brides, or as whores, or with feminist values that rejected {{the use of a}} woman's looks for her self-advancement. Author William McKeen of Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology commented that with the song, Madonna became the last word in attitude and fashion for young girls of that time. He compared that image of Madonna with that of Barbie. McKeen explained that Madonna intermixed middle-class ideas of femininity with examples of what femininity meant to her, which was having equal opportunity. She offered an aggressive sexuality that implied it was acceptable for women not only to initiate relationships, but also enjoy them.|$|E

5|$|He is the player's first {{opponent}} {{in all of}} his roles and is famous for his weakness and cowardice. These elements are considered by critics to be <b>stereotypes</b> <b>of</b> French people. These characteristics were emphasized by the developer of the Wii game which included cutscenes which depict Glass Joe in French settings. Glass Joe {{is considered one of the}} most well-known characters in the Punch-Out!! series and a Nintendo icon. His name has been used to describe poor performance by sportspeople and teams. In The Wii game his dialogue consists of him pleading not for the player to strike him in the jaw, complaints about the tightness of his gloves, and counting to ten in French.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{historians of}} the 18th and 19th centuries {{rejected}} stories of hermaphroditism in hyenas, and recognised {{the differences between}} the spotted and striped hyena. However, they continued to focus on the species' scavenging habits, their potential to rob graves and their perceived cowardice. During the 20th century, Western and African <b>stereotypes</b> <b>of</b> the spotted hyena converged; in both Ernest Hemingway's Green Hills of Africa and Disney's The Lion King, the traits of gluttony and comical stupidity, common in African depictions of hyenas, are added to the Western perception of hyenas being cowardly and ugly. After the release of The Lion King, hyena biologists protested against the animal's portrayal: one hyena researcher sued Disney studios for defamation of character, and another who had organized the animators' visit to the University of California's Field Station for Behavioural Research, where they would observe and sketch captive hyenas suggested boycotting the film.|$|E
5|$|Taiko {{performance}} {{was an important}} part of cultural development by third-generation Japanese residents in North America, who are called sansei. During World War II, second-generation Japanese residents, called nisei faced internment in the United States and in Canada {{on the basis of their}} race. During and after the war, Japanese residents were discouraged from activities such as speaking Japanese or forming ethnic communities. Subsequently, sansei could not engage in Japanese culture and instead were raised to assimilate into more normative activities. There were also prevailing <b>stereotypes</b> <b>of</b> Japanese people, which sansei sought to escape or subvert. During the 1960s in the United States, the Civil Rights Movement influenced sansei to reexamine their heritage by engaging in Japanese culture in their communities; one such approach was through taiko performance. Groups such as San Jose Taiko were organized to fulfill a need for solidarity and to have a medium to express their experiences as Japanese-Americans. Later generations have adopted taiko in programs or workshops established by sansei; social scientist Hideyo Konagaya remarks that this attraction to taiko among other Japanese art forms may be due to its accessibility and energetic nature. Konagaya has also argued that the resurgence of taiko in the United States and Japan are differently motivated: in Japan, {{performance was}} meant to represent the need to recapture sacred traditions, while in the United States it was meant to be an explicit representation of masculinity and power in Japanese-American men.|$|E

5|$|The series {{introduced}} Tintin's adversary Roberto Rastapopoulos in Cigars of the Pharaoh, here {{depicted as}} a famous Hollywood film director. It {{is only in the}} successor volume, The Blue Lotus, that he is also revealed as the head of an international criminal organisation. His name was developed by one of Hergé's friends; Hergé thought it was hilarious and decided to use it. He devised Rastapopoulos as an Italian with a Greek surname, but the character fitted anti-Semitic <b>stereotypes</b> <b>of</b> Jews; Hergé was adamant that the character was not Jewish. A fourth recurring character introduced in this story was the Portuguese merchant Oliveira da Figueira, who would reappear in both the subsequent Adventures set in the Middle East, Land of Black Gold and The Red Sea Sharks. One of the core characters of the story was Sophocles Sarcophagus, an Egyptologist who is the stereotype of an eccentric professor. In this respect, he is a prototype for the character of Cuthbert Calculus, whom Hergé would introduce later in Red Rackham's Treasure.|$|E
