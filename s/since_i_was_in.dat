2500|$|On August 10, 2010 {{after being}} {{released}} Hamilton discussed {{in an interview}} his stay at the Psychiatric hospital and why upon filming of his release in a video why {{he was in a}} wheelchair stating:"The reason Im in a wheelchair is because I have sharp pains <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the hospital and a little bit before, he said. I have sharp pains when Im walking and literally I want to collapse but I can't I have to continue to walk. So my right leg has been acting kinda funny. I still {{have a little bit of}} mobility, I can still stand up in the booth but I'd rather the mobility of my legs be jeopardized than my musicality be jeopardized at any given point of time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Koceski was {{recruited}} {{as a football}} player by Pitt, Penn State, Army, Navy, Notre Dame, Alabama, Tennessee, and Columbia, but he chose the University of Michigan. [...] In a 1948 interview, Koceski explained his selection of Michigan, [...] "Ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the sixth grade at First Ward public school, I had {{wanted to go to}} Michigan. [...] It seemed {{too good to be true}} when they accepted me." [...] In 1947, he played on the freshman team coached by Wally Weber. [...] Koceski joined the varsity team in 1948 and helped the Wolverines to an undefeated season and national championship. [...] In Michigan's 28–0 victory over Northwestern in 1948, Koceski scored three touchdowns. [...] Michigan's fourth touchdown in the Northwestern game resulted from a Koceski fumble as he crossed the goal line, with the ball being recovered in the end zone by teammate Bob Erben. [...] Following the Northwestern game, the Associated Press wrote:"Koceski carried the ball only six times for 20 yards, a running figure exceeded by both Ortmann and End Dick Rifenburg, but the little right halfback who stepped into the man-sized shoes of the departed Bump Elliott and fills 'em like they were made for him caught three passes for 40 yards more." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jimmy looked astonished. [...] "It's {{the first}} I've heard of it--but, of course, it's {{a little while}} <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Vancouver. Where did they raise the money?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have often}} heard the Inspector {{tell the tale}} to Our Excellency at feeding-time in the kennels; but <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> the Government service I have never told it to my people. May I loose that tale among the villages?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed, {{your words}} are {{both good and}} fair," [...] said Nigel. [...] "By Saint Paul! I cannot call to mind that I have ever met a man who bore himself better. But <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> my armor and you without, I see not how we can debate the matter." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If I'd {{seen any}} soap an' water I'd known what they meant; but it's {{been so long}} <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> a reg'lar house that I've kind'er forgot how to behave." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't been weighed <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> England," [...] {{said the}} other, {{beginning}} to {{get the better of}} his shyness. [...] "I was eight stone four then; so you see I am only a light-weight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look now," [...] Tito went on, soothingly, {{opening the}} wallet that hung at his belt, [...] "here {{is a pretty}} charm that I have had a long while--ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Sicily, a country a long way off." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "This {{is a city}} of conspirators," [...] he declared. [...] "You make a man vain {{and happy}} and joyous at the same time. Let your dinner be served, then, Henri. <b>Since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Paris last I have eaten many times, but I have not dined." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, cousin Malchus," [...] he said, [...] "though it {{is but a}} year <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Carthage, I should scarce {{have known}} you, so much have you grown. I see you have entered the cavalry. That is well. You cannot begin too early to accustom {{yourself}} to war." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are only}} friends of a week. I have been living, ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Germany, a very retired life. A {{circumstance}} of a most painful nature drove me from England; a circumstance of which I can hardly flatter myself, and can hardly wish, {{that you should}} be ignorant." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>Since</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> {{the way of}} transcribing, the {{following}} were the production of yesterday as I jogged through the wild hills of New Cumnock.

6000|$|... "It will be {{just the}} work to suit us," [...] the guerilla chief said. [...] "And as I {{received}} a subsidy from your political agent at Lisbon, a few days <b>since,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>in</b> a position to keep the whole force I have together; which <b>is</b> more than <b>I</b> can do generally for, even if successful in {{an attack on a}} convoy, the greater portion of the men scatter and return to their homes and, as long as their share of the booty lasts, they do not care to come out again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would have}} swam ashore long ago, {{but at night}} <b>I</b> have always <b>been</b> locked up, ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> captured, <b>in</b> a cabin below. Tonight the door opened quietly, and someone came in and said: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, lad, well," [...] said Bartle, in {{a gentle}} tone, strangely in {{contrast}} with his usual peremptoriness and impatience of contradiction, [...] "it's likely enough I talk foolishness. I'm an old fellow, and it's a good many years <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> trouble myself. It's easy finding reasons why other folks should be patient." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} come up, husband," [...] Lady De Courcy said. [...] "'Tis {{some time}} <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> town, and I would fain see what people are wearing, for the fashions change so rapidly that if one is away from town six months one finds that {{everyone}} stares, as if one {{had come from a}} barbarous country." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 2002, Moore {{declined}} to be interviewed by the Wall Street Journal on the subject of his work on Islam, stating that [...] "it's been ten or eleven years <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> involved <b>in</b> the Qur'an." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'They wouldn't {{know what}} {{such a thing}} meant. It <b>is</b> years <b>since</b> <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the house. <b>I</b> believe that Mrs. Bolton devotes herself to {{religious}} exercises and that she regards me as a pagan.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} make myself at home," [...] said Rilla. [...] "I know that is just what Hannah would want me to do. I'll get a little snack for Jims and me, and then if the rain {{continues}} and nobody comes home I'll just go upstairs to the spare room and go to bed. There is nothing like acting sensibly in an emergency. If <b>I</b> had not <b>been</b> a goose when I saw Jims fall off the train I'd have rushed {{back into the car}} and got some one to stop it.

6000|$|... "No; but I mean to see her. I couldn't {{make her}} first husband member, and {{therefore}} {{the man who is}} member is to be her second husband. But I'm almost sick of schemes.

I have never really enjoyed anything <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> love, and I only liked that because it was wicked." ...|$|E
60|$|I think I {{must have}} stepped over a {{grateful}} fairy at that moment, for who else could have reminded me so opportunely of my famous {{manipulation of the}} eyebrows, forgotten <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the fifth form? I alone of boys {{had been able to}} elevate and lower my eyebrows separately; when the one was climbing my forehead the other descended it, like the two buckets in the well.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have," [...] {{answered}} Hawkswing. [...] "Many moons {{have passed}} <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> this spot. My nation was strong then. It is weak now. Few braves are left. We sometimes carried our furs to that fort {{to trade with}} the pale-faces. It is called the Mountain Fort. The chief of the pale-faces was a bad man then. He loved fire-water too much. If he is there still, I do not wonder that there is war {{between him and the}} red-men." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have smelt him," [...] {{answered}} Sir Patrick, [...] "ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> the summer-house. There is a detestable {{taint of}} tobacco in the air--suggestive (disagreeably suggestive to my mind) of your friend, Mr. Delamayn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Our {{numbers are}} going to turn up," [...] he insisted cheerfully. [...] "I am certain of it now. Do you know {{that this is the first}} time <b>I</b> have played <b>since</b> <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> Monte Carlo?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not yet. <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> {{too busy}} to call on him <b>since</b> <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>in</b> town. Pardon me, Lady Loring, who is that {{beautiful}} creature in the pale yellow dress? Surely I have seen her somewhere before?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I seem to {{have come}} into an {{inheritance}} with a vengeance," [...] said he when the long narrative was finished. [...] "Of course, I've heard of the hound ever <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> the nursery. It's the pet story of the family, though I never thought of taking it seriously before. But as to my uncle's death--well, it all seems boiling up in my head, and I can't get it clear yet. You don't seem quite to have made up your mind whether it's a case for a policeman or a clergyman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear fellow," [...] Halson answered, [...] "you must {{brush up}} your {{contemporary}} history. It's {{more than a}} fortnight <b>since</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> Japan." [...] He shook hands with me, and I introduced him to Rulledge and Wanhope. He said at once: [...] "Well, what is it? Question of Braybridge's engagement? It's humiliating to a man {{to come back from}} the antipodes and find the nation absorbed in a parochial problem like that. Everybody I've met here to-night has asked me, the first thing, if I'd heard of it, and if I knew how it could have happened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Five o'clock.--It is serious. Ten minutes <b>since,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> my bedroom, which {{communicates}} {{with the}} sitting-room.

The next instant the sitting-room door was suddenly opened; the woman's voice said, 'Are these the apartments {{you have got to}} let?' and though the landlady, behind her, answered, 'No! higher up, ma'am,' the woman came on straight to my bedroom, as if she had not heard. I had just time to slam the door in her face before she saw me. The necessary explanations and apologies followed between the landlady and the stranger in the sitting-room, and then I was left alone again.|$|E
