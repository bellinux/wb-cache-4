40|$|Impromidine-analogous guanidines: {{synthesis}} {{and activity}} at the histamine H 2 -receptor. 29. Histamine analogs. / 19 impromidine analogous guanidines were synthetized by acid hydrolysis of the corresponding N-cyanoguanidines. The guanidines were tested on the isolated spontaneously beating guinea-pig atrium for histamine H 2 -receptor affinity. Lengthening the ethyl chain of cysteamine by one methylene group leads to partial agonists of decreased activity. Impromidine congeners containing a branched cimetidine side chain prove to be potent H 2 -agonists with maximal or near maximal response. Affinity ratios in favour of the (R) -configurated enantiomers are moderate but clearly significant. The interaction between the affinity contributing moiety and the complementary receptor area shows a lower degree of stereoselectivity than does the efficacy contributing (imidazole- 4 -yl) propyl substituent of impromidine and <b>sopromidine,</b> respectively. Homoisohistamine derivatives dramatically lose both efficacy and affinity...|$|E
