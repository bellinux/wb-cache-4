Multi-chips integration is the trend of the present semiconductor and package industries due to advantages mentioned above. Among the multi-chips integration techniques, three-dimensional (3 D) integration {{is one of the most}} promising approaches in microelectronic integration and package techniques [5 – 11]. 3 D integration technologies achieve heterogeneous integration and offer a smaller area solution for electronic products by the Cu through-silicon via (TSV) interconnection and vertical stacking.

The significance of the 0. 0008 -in. clearance curve is that, with design optimizing the seal cross section, it is expected that the seal flexibility could be increased, thereby resulting in a running clearance and thus a leakage flow comparable to those of a rigid seal with only 0. 0008 -in. clearance from an initial clearance of about 0. 0025 in. In addition, because the seal is floating and is flexible, its ability to follow radiaL movements of the rotating wear ring without contact is excellent.

In the current study we have investigated the application of scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) for assessing the quality of metal thermocompression bonds, both by evaluating its capabilities of localizing areas of poor bonding, and by finding defects in the integrity of the bond <b>seal.</b> <b>Wafer</b> laminates containing a test vehicle of sealing frames with pre-defined defects in the bond metal layer were sealed by Au–Au and Al–Al thermocompression bonding. Employing SAM, an area of five chips of poor bonding was identified non-destructively on the Al–Al laminate. Line defects of width 3. 6 µm and point defects of diameter 22. 4 µm have also been identified by SAM. The dicing yield for sealing frames was above 96 % for all frames of widths 100 – 400 µm and for both bond metal systems. The average bond strength was 31. 5 ± 11. 9 MPa for Al–Al thermocompression bonds and 37. 3 ± 9. 7 MPa for Au–Au thermocompression bonds.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a detailed description}} of the fabrication steps for wafer level processing of silicon interposers with copper filled TSVs as well as their subsequent assembly treatment. The electrical performance and characterization of the TSVs is also discussed. The interposers are created at 200 mm or 300 mm silicon wafers. The fabrication processes include deep reactive ion etching, TSV side wall isolation, PVD seed layer deposition, TSV filling by copper electroplating, wafer front side redistribution, temporary wafer bonding, wafer thinning by mechanical grinding, CMP, silicon dry etching, PECVD, silicon oxide dry etching and wafer backside redistribution. Depending on the final device application, after backside processing a component assembly is done directly at the interposer backside. In other cases, the interposer wafers are either released from the carrier wafers or transfer bonded so that their front side can be accessed again and the component assembly can be done. Finally, the assembled interposers can be release from their carrier wafers and singulated or run into further processes like molding or hermetic <b>sealing</b> by <b>wafer</b> to wafer bonding using suitable capwafers. In the following sections, important technological aspects of interposer fabrication and assembly as well as results from electrical characterizations will be presented.

40|$|Scanning laser {{projection}} using resonant actuated MEMS scanning mirrors {{is expected}} to overcome the current limitation of small display size of mobile devices like cell phones, digital cameras and PDAs. Recent progress {{in the development of}} compact modulated RGB laser sources enables to set up very small laser projection systems that become attractive not only for consumer products but also for automotive applications like head-up and dash-board displays. Within the last years continuous progress was made in increasing MEMS scanner performance. However, only little is reported on how mass-produceability of these devices and stable functionality even under harsh environmental conditions can be guaranteed. Automotive application requires stable MEMS scanner operation over a wide temperature range from - 40 ° to + 85 °Celsius.

Significant advancements in seal technology are required to meet the extreme demands placed on the seals, including the simultaneous requirements of low leakage, conformable, high temperature, high pressure, sliding operation. In this investigation, the design, development, analytical and experimental evaluation of a new ceramic <b>wafer</b> <b>seal</b> that shows promise of meeting these demands will be addressed. A high temperature seal test fixture was designed and fabricated to measure static seal leakage performance under engine simulated conditions. Ceramic <b>wafer</b> <b>seal</b> leakage rates are presented for engine-simulated air pressure differentials (up to 100 psi), and temperature (up to 1350 F), sealing both flat and distorted wall conditions, where distortions can be as large as 0. 15 inches in only an 18 inch span. Seal leakage rates are low, meeting an industry-established tentative leakage limit for all combinations of temperature, pressure and wall conditions considered. A seal leakage model developed from externally-pressurized gas film bearing theory is also presented. Predicted leakage rates agree favorably with the measured data for nearly all conditions of temperature and pressure. Discrepancies noted at high engine pressure and temperature are attributed to thermally-induced, non-uniform changes in {{the size and shape}} of the leakage gap condition. The challenging thermal environment the seal must operate in places considerable demands on the seal concept and material selection. Of the many high temperature materials considered in the design, ceramics were the only materials that met the many challenging seal material design requirements. Of the aluminum oxide, silicon carbide, and silicon nitride ceramics considered in the material ranking scheme developed herein, the silicon nitride class of ceramics ranked the highest because of their high temperature strength; resistance to the intense heating rates; resistance to hydrogen damage; and good structural properties.
