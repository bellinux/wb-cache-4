5|$|Approximately {{seven percent}} of the finds consist of textiles. Much of the clothing, {{particularly}} that of the officers and their personal servants, is well preserved and has provided information on clothing manufacture during the late 17th century, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> otherwise been difficult to research based only on depictions.|$|E
5|$|Relative {{to their}} high standards, UConn {{struggled}} {{during the first}} two years following Taurasi's graduation in 2004. Some of its highly touted recruits did not play up to expectations while others suffered injuries. Taken together during the three years 2005–2007, UConn never made a Final Four, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> become almost routine (17 final fours in 22 years from 1995 to 2016).|$|E
5|$|Strep throat {{is spread}} by {{respiratory}} droplets from an infected person. It may be spread directly or by touching <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> droplets {{on it and}} then touching the mouth, nose, or eyes. Some people may carry the bacteria without symptoms. It may also be spread by skin infected with group A strep. The diagnosis is made {{based on the results}} of a rapid antigen detection test or throat culture in those who have symptoms.|$|E

5|$|Sites in Africa {{have been}} marked as such {{for a variety}} of reasons, such as {{deforestation}} and hunting, civil war, threats to and hostage taking of reserve staff, oil and gas projects and mining, declines in biodiversity, and structural damage to buildings. Three sites were formerly declared as being in danger, but have since lost the status: the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (19841989), the Rwenzori Mountains National Park (19992004), and Tipasa (20022006). The Garamba National Park and Timbuktu have also lost their statuses in 1992 and 2005, respectively, but later regained it in 1996 and 2012. Despite its large number of endangered sites and the circumstances surrounding them, African World Heritage Sites have never been stripped of their title, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> only occurred twice.|$|E
5|$|The {{residents}} initially {{arrive at}} the hospital each morning and argue over who will care for a certain patient that arrives each day. A hospital superior {{is in charge of}} assigning cases, often translating to tense feelings between the residents and their superiors. Episodes migrate {{back and forth from the}} doctors interacting with their patients, and with their co-workers. Once assigned a case, each doctor diagnoses the patient, with the help of his or her attending physician, which usually leads to surgery. The surgeons tend to form personal connections with their patients, with a patient often conveying a message to his or her doctor, which unintentionally relates to the doctor's private life. The show displays the growth of relationships between the doctors, either friendly or sexual, often stemming to a clash between their personal and professional lives. Emotional scenes are often accompanied by an indie rock background song, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> become a hallmark of the series. At the conclusion of each episode, one of the characters delivers another voice-over, typically contrasting or following up on their initial one.|$|E
25|$|Mortlockese uses tense markers such as mii and {{to denote}} {{the present tense}} state of a subject, aa to denote a present tense state that an object has changed to from a different, past state, kɞ to {{describe}} <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> already been completed, pɞ and lɛ to denote future tense, pʷapʷ to denote a possible action or state in future tense, and sæn/mwo for <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> not happened yet. Each of these markers is {{used in conjunction with}} the subject proclitics except for the markers aa and mii. Additionally, the marker mii can be used with any type of intransitive verb.|$|E
50|$|Other {{noticeable}} {{shows were}} the last show in Perth, where Springsteen did not play a single song from The Rising album, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> not happened since its release in 2002. The show in Brisbane featured eleven songs from the first two albums, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>had</b> never previously happened at a Springsteen show. During the shows in Auckland, Springsteen mentioned Christchurch and the recent happenings several times and dedicated songs on both nights to it.|$|R

25|$|The realis base {{develops}} {{into the}} hypothetical. The realis base {{was used to}} describe <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> already occurred. This usage begins to fade and results in hypothetical usage that have not already occurred. Note that Modern Japanese only has a hypothetical, not a realis base anymore.|$|E
25|$|The ITER {{fusion reactor}} has been {{designed}} to produce 500 megawatts of output power for around twenty minutes while needing 50 megawatts to operate. Thereby the machine aims to demonstrate the principle of producing more energy from the fusion process than is used to initiate it, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> not yet been achieved in any fusion reactor.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{legitimacy}} of such actions as Satanic endeavors, rather than simply rebellious actions done for publicity, is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> been doubted by even {{some of those who}} contribute to the genre. Within the black metal scene, a number of musicians later replaced Satanic themes with those deriving from Heathenry, a form of modern Paganism.|$|E

25|$|Grief is a {{multifaceted}} response to loss, {{particularly to the}} loss of someone or <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> died, to which a bond or affection was formed. Although conventionally focused on the emotional response to loss, it also has physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, cultural, and philosophical dimensions. While the terms are often used interchangeably, bereavement refers to the state of loss, and grief is the reaction to that loss.|$|E
25|$|Palahniuk was cajoled to {{continue}} Fight Club in comics form by fellow novelist Chelsea Cain and comic writers Brian Michael Bendis, Matt Fraction and Kelly Sue DeConnick. A teaser {{was released by}} Dark Horse Comics for Free Comic Book Day 2015, with Fight Club 2 #1 following in late May of that year. The series explores Joseph Campbell's concept of the 'second father' as being vital to the hero's journey, which is <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> always fascinated Palahniuk.|$|E
25|$|Passion {{is closely}} aligned with faith in Kierkegaard's thought. Faith as a passion is what drives humans to seek reality and truth in a transcendent world, even though {{everything}} we can know intellectually speaks against it. To live and die for a belief, to stake everything one has {{and is in the}} belief in <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> a higher meaning than anything in the world—this is belief and passion at their highest.|$|E

25|$|Among {{its more}} unusual activities, the {{university}} has institutes devoted {{to the study of}} coffee and of bridge. Indeed, the modern form of the latter was developed by Harold Stirling Vanderbilt, {{a former president of the}} university's Board of Trust and a great-grandson of the Commodore. In addition, in mid-2004 it was announced that Vanderbilt's chemical biology research may have serendipitously opened the door to the breeding of a blue rose, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> long been coveted by horticulturalists and rose lovers.|$|E
25|$|Beuys {{explained}} his performance thus: “In putting honey {{on my head}} I am clearly doing <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> to do with thinking. Human ability is not to produce honey, but to think, to produce ideas. In this way the deathlike character of thinking becomes lifelike again. For honey is undoubtedly a living substance. Human thinking can be lively too. But {{it can also be}} intellectualized to a deadly degree, and remain dead, and express its deadliness in, say, the political or pedagogic fields.|$|E
25|$|The {{necessity}} participles {{are used}} to describe <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> to be done: Įsidėmėtinos rašybos atvejis – A spelling case one has to pay special attention to. Abejotina, ar mums pavyks – It is to be doubted if we succeed. Mostly limited to official styles, but certain participles are actively used in colloquial speech as well, some of them being considered more adjectives than verbs: Jis suimtas už pasibaisėtiną elgesį su gyvūnais – He was arrested for an appalling behaviour with animals. (Pasibaisėtinas = one {{that has to be}} detested).|$|E

25|$|The 2006 Texas 22nd congressional {{district}} election for the 110th Congress {{was held on}} November 7, 2006, and attracted considerable attention because this district was represented by former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay, a prominent member of the Republican Party, who resigned after being indicted and subsequently winning the Republican primary. Because of Texas state law (and court rulings interpreting it), Republicans, in order {{to hold on to}} the seat, would have had to win a write-in campaign, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> only been done four other times in the history of U.S. Congressional elections.|$|E
25|$|Karzai is {{believed}} to be from the Shamizai subtribe of the Popalzais. His grandfather, Khair Muhammad Karzai, was a head of the Popalzai tribe from Kandahar who relocated to Kabul and ran the business of a guest house. This allowed Karzai's father Abdul Ahad, to gain a foothold in the royal family, and subsequently, the parliament. These actions and upwards movement within the Popalzai tribal system, led to the Karzai family furnishing a viable Shamizai clan alternative to Sadozai leadership {{in the aftermath of the}} Soviet invasion when the Sadozai clan failed to provide a tribal leader. He is often seen wearing a Karakul hat, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> been worn by many Afghan kings in the past.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to make the game look more realistic, many of the real players in the game had their entire body scanned into the game, as opposed to just the face like in {{previous}} NBA 2K games. A first for the NBA 2K series, the full body scanning allows the entire body of a specific player to be uniquely different from any other body. In previous NBA 2K games, a player's face was unique, while the body was generic and predefined. The full body scanning improves details in players' tattoos as well, <b>something</b> <b>that</b> <b>has</b> been criticized in past NBA 2K games. Cheerleaders, coaches, and fans were also scanned into the game; the designs of cheerleaders, coaches, and the crowd have too been criticized in past games.|$|E
