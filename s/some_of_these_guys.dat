Because <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> young <b>guys</b> are thinking, 'Well, I'm doing what I want to do' - but that's not true. They're doing what they're supposed to do. Jackson Jackson is based on my Uncle Jay. He said those exact words to me one time at the Red Lobster here in Bloomington. He and his wife got a divorce. She was 14 and he was 17 when they got married - and he said, 'Man, I have done exactly what I'm supposed to my whole life. I married this girl when she was 14 - I didn't love her. We had kids. We raised the kids. I stayed there. I worked every day pouring concrete. Now I'm in my 40s, and I {{want to do something}} for myself.' And I asked, 'Well, what do you have in mind?' He said, 'I don't know.' You can't be 21, though, and relate to that. I mean, I look back on my life now - and you look back on your life - and you realize that we hardly ever really get to do what we wanted to do. Suddenly, it's 17 turns 35 - and how can someone 21 understand that?" ...|$|R

As the 1947 season wore on, there was tacit acceptance {{of the fact that}} blacks were now playing big league ball and were probably there to stay. Robinson still got pitches thrown at him, but, as Reese recounted to author Roger Kahn, [...] "I told him, 'You know Jack, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> are throwing at you because you're black.

40|$|Transcription begins] 29 November 1944 Somewheres in Germany My beloved, I {{received}} 3 letters today, {{one from}} mother, one from my mother, and one V-mail from you, my darling, dated 6 November. Frankly, darling, I think air mail is faster. The weather was absolutely gorgeous today, {{and the air}} force took full advantage of the excellent weather much to our enjoyment. Today, I took advantage of the little comforts in the army to take a haircut and get one of those wonderful hot shower baths that I described in a past letter. Strange as it may seem when we came up there today we didn’t recognize the place. It seems that some enemy artillery got a few lucky shots on the place and bashed the front of the place in, but did not harm the showers, etc. The director of the mine where the showers are located said the biggest loss was the loss of all the records of production. But he said that that didn’t matter anyway. Darling, by the time the confusion resulting from the change of APO’s should be all cleared up. Golly, we have it easy here. Compared to the “dough-feet[. ”] Gee, {{my heart goes out to}} those guys who slosh around in the mud and go hungry many times because food can’t be brought to them. They are the fellows who deserve all the praise. On our way back from the shower house we passed a sign put up by our engineers, which read: “This place is lousy with mines[. ”] It was humorous but also deadly serious. It is no unusual sight to see many cattle blown up in fields that were mined by the Germans before they had to leave. As for me, I’m not sticking my nose out of anyplace that hasn’t been trod over before by someone else. I’ve got some more copies of “Stars 2 ̆ 6 Stripes” on hand which I shall send you first chance I get. Do you enjoy them? It is our principle medium of detailed news. We keep right up to the minute with radio newscasts, too. It burns my “gut” to read in the Stars 2 ̆ 6 Stripes where a Representative from N. Y. in England now, is going to investigate whether or not the need for shells is imperative. You’re darn right they are! Get this point over to people who are crying for reconversion. Tell them that it might take a little longer before they get all those bright new products for civilian use. Thus far I have been spared many of the horrors of war. As far as I’m concerned, I’m very happy and just as well do without them, it it’s O. K. with you. This evening we’re going to have another little snack—in fact Doc’s detachment is preparing french fried potatoes now. Mm! As it gets closer to Christmas, <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>guys</b> are getting pretty homesick. You should see these Christmas songs bring water to the eyes—sometimes even to my eyes, too. After all, I remember the fun we had together last year this time. War can bring some pretty ludicrous situations into the picture. In a nearby town which was taken from the Nazis not so long ago (safe now), we saw some dough boys cleaning up (actually as well as literally) some of the stores in the town. Some of them were parading around in stove pipe hats and canes. Silly kids they were and they knew it, too. I saw one dough boy cramming civilian ties into his duffle bag. Why? I don’t think even he knew. Another amusing sight was to see GI’s painted the cars green O. D. and found them very comfortable. Naturally, when they move from a particular area they’re abandoned anyway. People do strange things under duress and tension. It seems that I haven’t approached that state yet. Precious, the 14 th of December marks the 2 ½ yr. Anniversary of wedded bliss. Had I known our marriage would turn out like this, it would have been the 5 ½ year anniversary, I assure you. Don’t think that it is absence alone that makes me feel this way. No, darling, I’m really and truly in love with my wife. Forever, Vic [Transcription ends...|$|E
