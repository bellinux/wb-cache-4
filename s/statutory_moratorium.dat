2500|$|After the Cork Report in 1982, a {{major new}} {{objective}} for UK insolvency law became creating a [...] "rescue culture" [...] for business, as well as ensuring transparency, accountability and collectivity. The hallmark of the rescue culture is the administration procedure in the Insolvency Act 1986, Schedule B1 as updated by the Enterprise Act 2002. Under Schedule B1, paragraph 3 sets the primary objective of the administrator as [...] "rescuing the company as a going concern", or if not usually selling the business, {{and if this is}} not possible realising the property to distribute to creditors. Once an administrator is appointed, she will replace the directors. Under paragraph 40 all creditors are precluded by a <b>statutory</b> <b>moratorium</b> from bringing enforcement procedures to recover their debts. This even includes a bar on secured creditors taking and or selling assets subject to security, unless they get the court's permission. The moratorium is fundamental to keeping the business' assets intact and giving the company a [...] "breathing space" [...] for the purpose of a restructure. It also extends to a moratorium on the enforcement of criminal proceedings. So in Environmental Agency v Clark the Court of Appeal held that the Environment Agency needed court approval to bring a prosecution against a polluting company, though in the circumstances leave was granted. Guidance for when leave should be given by the court was elaborated in Re Atlantic Computer Systems plc (No 1). In this case, the company in administration had sublet computers that were owned by a set of banks who wanted to repossess them. Nicholls LJ held leave to collect assets should be given if it would not impede the administration's purpose, but strong weight should be given to the interests of the holder of property rights. Here, the banks were given permission because the costs to the banks were disproportionate to the benefit to the company. The moratorium lasts for one year, but can be extended with the administration.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a company}} nears insolvency, UK law {{provides}} four main procedures {{by which the}} company could potentially be rescued or wound down and its assets distributed. First, a company voluntary arrangement, allows the directors of a company {{to reach an agreement}} with creditors to potentially accept less repayment in the hope of avoiding a more costly administration or liquidation procedure and less in returns overall. However, only for small private companies is a <b>statutory</b> <b>moratorium</b> on debt collection by secured creditors available. Second, and since the Enterprise Act 2002 the preferred insolvency procedure, a company which is insolvent can go under administration. Here a qualified insolvency practitioner will replace the board of directors and is charged with a public duty of rescuing the company in the interests of all creditors, rescuing the business through a sale, getting a better result for creditors than immediate liquidation, or if nothing can be done effecting an orderly winding up and distribution of assets. Third, administrative receivership is a procedure available for a fixed list of eight kinds of operation (such as public-private partnerships, utility projects and protected railway companies) where the insolvency practitioner is appointed by the holder of a floating charge that covers a company's whole assets. This stems from common law receivership where the insolvency practitioner's primary duty was owed to the creditor that appointed him. After the Insolvency Act 1986 it was increasingly viewed to be unacceptable that one creditor could manage a company when the interests of her creditor might conflict with those holding unsecured or other debts. Fourth, when none of these procedures is used, the business is wound up and a company's assets are to be broken up and sold off, a liquidator is appointed. All procedures must be overseen by a qualified insolvency practitioner. While liquidation remains the most frequent end for an insolvent company, UK law since the Cork Report has aimed to cultivate a [...] "rescue culture" [...] to save companies that could be viable.|$|E
2500|$|While UK {{insolvency}} law fixes a priority regime, and within each class of creditor {{distribution of assets}} is proportional or pari passu, creditors can [...] "jump up" [...] the priority ladder through contracts. A contract for a security interest, which is traditionally conceptualised as creating a proprietary right that is enforceable against third parties, will generally allow the secured creditor to take assets away, free from competing claims of other creditors if the company cannot service its debts. This is the first and foremost function of a security interest: to elevate the creditor's place in the insolvency queue. A second function of security is to allow the creditor to trace the value in an asset through different people, should the property be wrongfully disposed of. Third, security assists independent, out-of-court enforcement for debt repayment (subject to the <b>statutory</b> <b>moratorium</b> on insolvency), and so provides a lever against which the secured lender can push for control's over the company's management. However, given the adverse distributional impact between creditors, the economic effect of secured lending is a negative externality against non-adjusting creditors. With an ostensibly private contract between a secured lender and a company, assets that {{would be available to}} other creditors are diminished without their consent and without them being privy to the bargain. Nevertheless, security interests are commonly argued to facilitate the raising of capital and hence economic development, which is argued to indirectly benefits all creditors. UK law has, so far, struck a compromise approach of enforcing all [...] "fixed" [...] or [...] "specific" [...] security interests, but only partially enforcing floating charges that cover a range of assets that a company trades with. The holders of a floating charge take subject to preferential creditors and a [...] "ring fenced fund" [...] for up to a maximum of £600,000 reserved for paying unsecured creditors. The law requires that details of most kinds of security interests are filed on the register of charges kept by Companies House. However this does not include transactions with the same effect of elevating creditors in the priority queue, such as a retention of title clause or a Quistclose trust.|$|E

40|$|In a {{world of}} {{increasing}} concern about foreign oil imports and climate change, natural gas is expected to become an increasingly {{important part of the}} United States’ fuel mix. As conventional natural gas sources are depleted, the gas industry is turning to unconventional sources, including gas-containing shales. Gas shale can only be economically exploited using a method called hydraulic fracturing, which poses potentially grave dangers to surface and groundwater. North Carolina contains commercially viable gas shales. For this reason, the government of North Carolina must protect the state’s water when commercial-scale hydraulic fracturing begins. This masters project examines federal and state water-protection laws. Seven federal statutes were considered—Clean Water Act; Safe Drinking Water Act; National Environmental Policy Act; Resource Conversation and Recovery Act; Toxic Substances Control Act; Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act; and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act—along with two North Carolina state-level provisions. The project identifies exemption and exceptions that prevent these statutes from robustly protecting water quality from hydraulic fracturing. The project concludes with three major recommendations for North Carolina. First, the state should enact a <b>statutory</b> <b>moratorium</b> on hydraulic fracturing. Second, the state should reassess and strengthen state water quality laws and regulations. Third, the state should require openness by passing a state-level community right-to-know act...|$|E
