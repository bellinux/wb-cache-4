40|$|Cholesterol {{biosynthesis}} was {{studied in}} rat liver subcellular fractions incubated with dl-[2 - 14 C]mevalonic acid under gas phases consisting of either N 2 +O 2 (90 : 10) or CO+O 2 (90 : 10). CO inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis from [2 - 14 C]mevalonic acid {{and results in}} a large accumulation of radioactive 4, 4 -dimethyl sterols. Separation {{of the components of}} the 4, 4 -dimethyl <b>sterol</b> <b>fraction</b> showed that lanosterol and dihydrolanosterol are the major components that accumulate during cholesterol biosynthesis in an atmosphere containing CO, whereas 14 -demethyl-lanosterol and 14 -demethyldihydrolanosterol are the major components of the much less intensely radioactive 4, 4 -dimethyl <b>sterol</b> <b>fraction</b> isolated from incubations with N 2 +O 2 as the gas phase. The identities of lanosterol, dihydrolanosterol and 14 -demethyldihydrolanosterol were confirmed by both radiochemical and physicochemical methods, including g. l. c. and combined g. l. c. –mass spectrometry. CO therefore results in a qualitative as well as a quantitative difference in the 4, 4 -dimethyl <b>sterol</b> <b>fraction</b> which arises during cholesterol biosynthesis from mevalonic acid. The specific radioactivity of the [14 C]lanosterol biosynthesized in the presence of CO was lower than that of its companion, [14 C]dihydrolanosterol.

Importantly, CA 12 and CA 1008 retained an azole-resistant phenotype even when assayed {{in the presence of}} FK 506, a multidrug efflux inhibitor. Conversely, CA 488, CA 490, and three comparator isolates (CA 6, CA 14, and CA 177, in which ergosterol comprised > 80 % of the total <b>sterol</b> <b>fraction</b> and ergosta 7, 22 -dienol was undetectable) all displayed azole-sensitive phenotypes under efflux-inhibited assay conditions. Owing to their ergosterol content, CA 6, CA 14, and CA 177 were highly sensitive to amphotericin B (MIC values, < 0. 25 μg ml− 1); CA 1008, in which ergosterol comprised < 2 % of the total <b>sterol</b> <b>fraction,</b> was less sensitive (MIC, 1 μg ml− 1). CA 1008 harbored multiple amino acid substitutions in Erg 3 p but only a single conserved polymorphism (E 266 D) in sterol 14 α-demethylase (Erg 11 p). CA 12 harbored one substitution (W 332 R) in Erg 3 p and no residue changes in Erg 11 p. CA 488 and CA 490 were found to harbor multiple residue changes in both Erg 3 p and Erg 11 p.

40|$|The <b>sterol</b> <b>fraction</b> of milk is of {{nutritional}} interest because {{high levels of}} cholesterol in plasma (modulated by the cholesterol ingested) are associated with an increasing risk of cardiovascular disease. In addition, some sterols (ergosterol and 7 -dehydrocholesterol) are provitamins (D 2 and D 3 respectively). At the same time, through {{the study of the}} <b>sterol</b> <b>fraction,</b> vegetable fats can be detected in milk and dairy products. Sterols are a minor fraction of total milk fat, the main sterol being cholesterol (3 mg/g fat, equivalent to 100 mg/l cows' milk). Small quantities of other sterols (7 -dehydrocholesterol, 22 -dehydrocholesterol, ergosterol, fucosterol, lanosterol, lathosterol, 24 -methylenecholesterol) and several phytosterols have been reported in cows' milk (Walstra & Jennes, 1984). International Dairy Federation (1992) states that in the sterol profile of genuine milk fat there may appear, in addition to the peak of 7 -dehydrocholesterol which ranges from 0 · 7 to 4 % of total sterols, < 1 % of minor sterols with retention times corresponding to phytosterols. Values for the cholesterol content of goats' milk vary considerably, from 211 mg/l (Pantulu et al. 1975) to 125 mg/l (Lu, 1993), partly owing to the use of different analysis techniques. Some of these values were obtained using non-specific colorimetric methods, which are inaccurate in the presence of cholesterol precursors or phytosterols (Clark et al. 1983; Haugh & Harzer, 1984). Some minor peaks have been assumed to be sterols but have not been identified (García-Olmedo & Barrera, 1985). Conventional methods of sample preparation for sterol analysis prior to gas chromatography (GC), which involve saponification of fat with or without isolation of the <b>sterol</b> <b>fraction</b> by thin layer chromatography, are tedious and time-consuming. Transesterification with KOH–methanol has been successfully used as a rapid alternative for obtaining the unsaponifiable fraction.

Cells enriched in any one of the sterols did not differ in volume, growth rate, contents of free sterol, esters and phospholipids, or phospholipid composition. Cholesterol-enriched cells contained about 2 % more lipid than cells enriched in any of the other sterols, which was largely accounted for by increased contents of triacylglycerols and, to a lesser extent, esterified sterols. Phospholipids were enriched to the extent of about 52 to 63 % with C 18 : 1 residues. Cells enriched in ergosterol or stigmasterol were slightly less susceptible to the action of a wall-digesting basidiomycete glucanase than cells enriched with any one of the other sterols. The capacity of the plasma membrane to resist stretching, as indicated by the stability and volume of spheroplasts suspended in hypotonic solutions of buffered sorbitol (particularly in the range 0. 9 to 0. 7 M), was greater with spheroplasts enriched in sterols with an unsaturated side chain at C 17 (ergosterol or stigmasterol) than with any of the other sterols.

Fluorescence intensity and lifetime exhibit local minima (dips) whenever the total <b>sterol</b> mole <b>fraction,</b> irrespective of the DHE content, is near the critical mole <b>fractions</b> predicted for <b>sterols</b> being regularly distributed in hexagonal superlattices. This result provides evidence that {{all three of these}} naturally occurring sterols (e. g., cholesterol, ergosterol, and DHE) can be regularly distributed in the membrane and that the bulky tetracyclic ring of the sterols is the cause of regular distribution. Moreover, at the critical <b>sterol</b> mole <b>fractions,</b> the steady-state anisotropy of DHE fluorescence and the calculated rotational relaxation times exhibit distinct peaks, suggesting that membrane free volume reaches a local minimum at critical <b>sterol</b> mole <b>fractions.</b> This, combined with the well-known sterol condensing effect on lipid acyl chains, provides a new understanding of how variations in membrane sterol content change membrane free volume. In addition to the fluorescence dips/peaks corresponding to hexagonal superlattices, we have observed intermediate fluorescence dips/peaks at concentrations predicted by the centered rectangular superlattice model. However, the 22. 2 mol% dip for centered rectangular superlattices in DHE/ergosterol/DMPC mixtures becomes diminished after long incubation (4 weeks), whereas on the same time frame the 22. 2 mol% dip in DHE/cholesterol/DMPC mixtures remains discernible, suggesting that although all three of these sterols can be regularly distributed, subtle differences in sterol structure cause changes in lateral sterol organization in the membrane...|$|R

Unesterified cholesterol associated with the spermatozoa diminishes 10 -fold during passage through the epididymis. In the testis, very low concentrations of sterol sulfate are found, whereas in epi-didymal tissue appreciable amounts are found. This finding would indicate the synthesis of sterol sulfates by the epididymis. In epididymal tissue, the ratio of cholesterol precursors, either free or sulfurylated, vs cholesterol is high and this ratio increases from the caput to the cauda region.

40|$|AbstractThe {{interaction}} of an amphiphilic, 40 -amino acid β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide with liposomal membranes {{as a function}} of <b>sterol</b> mole <b>fraction</b> (Xsterol) was studied based on the fluorescence anisotropy of a site-specific membrane sterol probe, dehydroergosterol (DHE), and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the native Tyr- 10 residue of Aβ to DHE. Without Aβ, peaks or kinks in the DHE anisotropy versus Xsterol plot were detected at Xsterol ≈ 0. 25, 0. 33, and 0. 53. Monomeric Aβ preserved these peaks/kinks, but oligomeric Aβ suppressed them and created a new DHE anisotropy peak at Xsterol ≈ 0. 38. The above critical Xsterol values coincide favorably with the superlattice compositions predicted by the cholesterol superlattice model, suggesting that membrane cholesterol tends to adopt a regular lateral arrangement, or domain formation, in the lipid bilayers. For FRET, a peak was also detected at Xsterol ≈ 0. 38 for both monomeric and oligomeric Aβ, implying increased penetration of Aβ into the lipid bilayer at this <b>sterol</b> mole <b>fraction.</b> We conclude that the {{interaction of}} Aβ with membranes is affected by the lateral organization of cholesterol, and hypothesize that the formation of an oligomeric Aβ/cholesterol domain complex may be linked to the toxicity of Aβ in neuronal membranes...|$|R

The concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as well as different biochemical and ecophysiological variables were determined in mussel tissues, as indicators of the toxic impact of the spilled oil. The following parameters were measured: size frequency distributions and size–weight relationships, survival in air, biochemical composition (proteins, carbohydrates, glycogen and lipids), lipid classes (phospholipids, sterol esters and waxes, triacylglycerols, free fatty acids and sterols), and fatty acid composition.

These sterols differ by the degree of freedom of their lateral chain. We show that VDAC displays sensitivity to the lipid-sterol ratio and {{to the type of}} sterol found in the membrane. The main findings of this study are: 1), cholesterol and phytosterols modulate the selectivity but only stigmasterol alters the voltage-dependence of the plant VDAC in the range of <b>sterol</b> <b>fraction</b> found in the plant mitochondrial membrane; 2), VDAC unitary conductance is not affected by the addition of sterols; 3), the effect of sterols on the VDAC is reversible upon sterol depletion with 10 μM methyl-β-cyclodextrins; and 4), phytosterols are essential for the channel gating at salt concentration prevailing in vivo. A quantitative analysis of the voltage-dependence indicates that stigmasterol inhibits the transition of the VDAC in the lowest subconductance states. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

40|$|Herein we {{describe}} the isolation of homarine and piridiniumbetaine B from the sponge Aaptos sp. Although homarine has a common occurrence among animals, piridiniumbetaine B was only recently isolated from the marine sponge Agelas dispar. The isolation of piridiniumbetaine B from two taxonomically distant marine sponges corroborate previous assumptions that such betaines should be regarded rather as primary metabolites. We have also isolated (9 -[5 '-(methylthio) -beta-D-xylofuranosyl]adenine (xylosyl-MTA) from the mantle of a nudibranch identified as Doris aff. verrucosa. The occurrence of xylosyl-MTA in the mantle of this animal strongly {{suggests that it is}} the same nudibranch species described for the Mediterranean sea. We have been unable to detect any other compound in the mantle extract of D. aff. verrucosa other than xylosil-MTA and sterols. GC-MS analysis of the <b>sterol</b> <b>fraction</b> from the nudibranch and its prey, the sponge Hymeniacidon aff. heliophila, revealed the occurrence of the ubiquitous sterols, cholesterol, brassicasterol, cholestanol, 24 -methylcholesterol and 24 -ethylcholesterol, as the only common metabolites, therefore precluding any assumption concerning the sequestration of secondary metabolites by the nudibranch from H. aff. heliophila...|$|E
40|$|AbstractLactosylceramide (LacCer) {{is a key}} {{intermediate}} in glycosphingolipid {{metabolism and}} is highly enriched in detergent-resistant biomembrane fractions associated with microdomains, i. e., rafts and caveolae. Here, the lateral interactions of cholesterol with LacCers containing various homogeneous saturated (8 : 0, 16 : 0, 18 : 0, 24 : 0) or monounsaturated acyl chains (18 : 1, 24 : 1) have been characterized using a Langmuir-type film balance. Cholesterol-induced changes in lateral packing were assessed by measuring changes in average molecular area, i. e., area condensations, and in lateral elasticity, i. e., surface compressional moduli (CS− 1) with emphasis on high surface pressures (≥ 30 mN/m) that mimic biomembrane conditions. Cholesterol most dramatically affected the lateral packing elasticity of LacCers with long saturated acyl chains at <b>sterol</b> mole <b>fractions</b> ≥ 0. 3, consistent with liquid-ordered (LO) phase formation. The lateral elasticity within the LacCer-cholesterol LO-phase was much lower than that observed within pure LacCer condensed, i. e., gel, phase. The magnitude of the cholesterol-induced reduction in lateral elasticity was strongly mitigated by cis monounsaturation in the LacCer acyl chain. At identical high <b>sterol</b> mole <b>fractions,</b> higher lateral elasticity was observed within LacCer-cholesterol mixtures compared with galactosylceramide-cholesterol and sphingomyelin-cholesterol mixtures. The results show how changes to sphingolipid headgroup and acyl chain structure contribute to the modulation of lateral packing elasticity in sphingolipid-cholesterol LO-phases...|$|R
40|$|The {{post partum}} period is {{characterized}} by immunosuppression and increased disease susceptibility. Both phytosterols from microalga Dunaniella tertiolecta and dietary supplementation with n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) influence cell proliferation and cytokine release during inflammation. The objective {{of this paper was}} the evaluation of the effects of physterols, extracted and purified from D. tertiolecta, on the in vitro immune responses of ewes supplemented with flaxseed during post partum. Twenty Comisana parturient ewes were divided in two balanced groups, and supplemented with flaxseed (FS, 250 g/day) or fed with a conventional diet (CON). Blood samples (15 mL) were collected for five weeks, starting from lambing, in order to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Stimulated PBMC were treated with a total <b>sterols</b> <b>fraction</b> from D. tertiolecta (TS), a mix of ergosterol and 7 -dehydroporiferasterol (purified extract, PE), and a mix of acetylated ergosterol and 7 -dehydroporiferasterol (acetylated purified extract, AcPE), extracted and purified from D. tertiolecta at two concentrations (0. 4 and 0. 8 mg/mL). Results of the experiment demonstrated that n- 3 PUFA from flaxseed induced an anti-inflammatory cytokine profile, with an increase of both IL- 10, IL- 6 and a decrease of IL- 1 β. TS, PE, and AcPE purified from D. tertiolecta showed an anti-proliferative effect on sheep PBMC regardless their chemical composition and concentration...|$|R
40|$|The crude ethanolic {{extract from}} aerial parts of Pothomorphe umbellata L. (Piperaceae) and {{fractions}} obtained by partitions sequentially among water-methanol, methylene chloride, and ethyl acetate, {{as well as}} the major constituent, 4 -nerolidylcatechol, were, respectively, evaluated and evidenced for antioxidant and cytotoxic effects through fluorometric microplate and microculture tetrazolium assays in HL- 60 cells. The crude ethanolic extract demonstrated the preeminent antioxidant activity (IC 50 = 1. 2 [*]μg/mL) against exogenous cytoplasmic reactive oxygen species, followed by the water-methanolic (IC 50 = 4. 5 [*]μg/mL), methylene chloride (IC 50 = 5. 9 [*]μg/mL), ethyl acetate (IC 50 = 8. 0 [*]μg/mL), 4 -nerolidylcatechol (IC 50 = 8. 6 [*]μg/mL), and the <b>sterol</b> <b>fractions</b> (IC 50 > 12. 5 [*]μg/mL). Vitamin C, the positive control used in this assay, presented IC 50 value equivalent to 1. 7 [*]μg/mL. 4 -Nerolidylcatechol (IC 50 = 0. 4 [*]μg/mL) and methylene chloride fraction (IC 50 = 2. 3 [*]μg/mL) presented considerable cytotoxicity probably {{because of the presence of}} an o-quinone, an auto-oxidation by product of the catechol. Polar compounds, present in the ethanol extract, appear to increase the solubility and stability of the major active constituent, acting synergistically with 4 -nerolidylcatechol, improving its pharmacokinetic parameters and increasing significantly its antioxidant activity which, in turn, suggests that the aqueous-ethanolic extract, used in folklore medicine, is safe and effective...|$|R
