500|$|In Our Time {{was ignored}} and {{forgotten}} by literary critics for decades. Benson attributes the neglect to various factors. The Sun Also Rises, published the next year, {{is considered the}} more important book followed fairly rapidly by the popular A Farewell to Arms two years after in 1928; critics' general assumption {{seemed to be that}} Hemingway's talent lay in writing prose rather than [...] "sophisticated, complex design"; and In Our Time stories were combined with subsequent collections in the publication of The Fifth Column and the First Forty-Nine Stories in 1938, drawing the critics' attention away from the book as an entity, toward the individual stories. In 1962, when Scribner's released the paperback edition of In Our Time, it began to be taught in American universities, {{and by the end of}} the decade, the first critical study of the collection appeared. Benson describes the collection as the author's first [...] "major achievement"; Wagner-Martin as [...] "his most <b>striking</b> <b>work,</b> both in terms of personal involvement and technical innovation." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{experiment}} {{which has}} attracted most {{attention in the}} past has [...] been that of the Messrs. Briggs, at their collieries in Yorkshire, [...] England.(330) The relations between the owners and the laborers [...] were as bad as they could well be. “All coal-masters is devils, [...] and Briggs is the prince of devils,” ran the talk of the miners, [...] when they did not choose to send letters threatening to shoot the [...] owners. In 1865 Messrs. Briggs tried the plan of an industrial [...] partnership with their men, purely from business considerations. [...] Seventy per cent of the cost of raising coal consisted of wages, [...] and fully fifteen per cent of materials which were habitually [...] wasted. The whole property was valued, and divided into shares of [...] $50 each, of which the owners retained two thirds, together with [...] the control of the business. The remaining one third of the shares [...] was offered to the employés. If any subscriber was too poor to pay [...] $50 for a share, the subsequent dividends and payments were to be [...] applied to purchasing the share. After reserving a fair allowance [...] for expenses, like the redemption of capital, whenever the [...] remaining profits exceeded ten per cent on the capital, that [...] excess was to be divided into two equal parts, one of which was to [...] be distributed among all persons employed by the company in [...] proportion to their wages, and the other was to be retained by the [...] capital. In previous years but once had they made ten per cent [...] profit on their capital, and twice only five per cent. In the [...] first year after the new system came into operation, the total [...] profits were fourteen per cent, and the four per cent of excess [...] was divided, two to the laborers’ bonus, and two to the capital, [...] so that capital received twelve per cent. In the second year the [...] profits were sixteen per cent, in the third year seventeen per [...] cent; the first year the work-people received in addition to their [...] wages $9,000, in the second $13,500, in the third $15,750. The [...] moral effect was <b>striking.</b> <b>Work</b> was done regularly, forbearance [...] was exercised, habits improved, and the faces of the men were set [...] toward improvement in life. The scheme worked successfully for [...] years, but was finally ended by the pressure of the outside [...] trades-unions, who compelled the workmen to give up the [...] arrangement.|$|E
6000|$|A certain {{prudence}} {{had determined}} {{him to put}} off his visit till the morning; he thought it more probable that at that time {{he should be able}} to see Verena alone, whereas in the evening the two young women would be sure to be sitting together. When the morrow dawned, however, Basil Ransom felt none of the trepidation of the procrastinator; he knew nothing of the reception that awaited him, but he took his way to the cottage designated to him over-night by Doctor Prance, with the step of a man much more conscious of his own purpose than of possible obstacles. He made the reflexion, as he went, that to see a place for the first time at night is like reading a foreign author in a translation. At the present hour--it was getting towards eleven o'clock--he felt that he was dealing with the original. The little straggling, loosely-clustered town lay along the edge of a blue inlet, on the other side of which was a low, wooded shore, with a gleam of white sand where it touched the water. The narrow bay carried the vision outward to a picture that seemed at once bright and dim--a shining, slumbering summer sea, and a far-off, circling line of coast, which, under the August sun, was hazy and delicate. Ransom regarded the place as a town because Doctor Prance had called it one; but it was a town where you smelt the breath of the hay in the streets and you might gather blackberries in the principal square. The houses looked at each other across the grass--low, rusty, crooked, distended houses, with dry, cracked faces and the dim eyes of small-paned, stiffly-sliding windows. Their little door-yards bristled with rank, old-fashioned flowers, mostly yellow; and on the quarter that stood back from the sea the fields sloped upward, and the woods in which they presently lost themselves looked down over the roofs. Bolts and bars were not a part of the domestic machinery of Marmion, and the responsive menial, receiving the visitor on the threshold, was a creature rather desired than definitely possessed; so that Basil Ransom found Miss Chancellor's house-door gaping wide (as he had seen it the night before), and destitute even of a knocker or a bell-handle. From where he stood in the porch he could see the whole of the little sitting-room on the left of the hall--see that it stretched straight through to the back windows; that it was garnished with photographs of foreign works of art, pinned upon the walls, and enriched with a piano and other little extemporised embellishments, such as ingenious women lavish upon the houses they hire for a few weeks. Verena told him afterwards that Olive had taken her cottage furnished, but that the paucity of chairs and tables and bedsteads was such that their little party used almost to sit down, to lie down, in turn. On the other hand they had all George Eliot's writings, and two photographs of the Sistine Madonna. Ransom rapped with his stick on the lintel of the door, but no one came to receive him; so he made his way into the parlour, where he observed that his cousin Olive had as many German books as ever lying about. He dipped into this literature, momentarily, according to his wont, and then remembered that this was not what he had come for and that as he waited at the door he had seen, through another door, opening at the opposite end of the hall, signs of a small verandah attached to the other face of the house. Thinking the ladies might be assembled there in the shade, he pushed aside the muslin curtain of the back window, and saw that the advantages of Miss Chancellor's summer residence were in this quarter. There was a verandah, in fact, to which a wide, horizontal trellis, covered with an ancient vine, formed a kind of extension. Beyond the trellis was a small, lonely garden; beyond the garden was a large, vague, woody space, where a few piles of old timber were disposed, and which he afterwards learned to be a relic of the shipbuilding era described to him by Doctor Prance; and still beyond this again was the charming lake-like estuary he had already admired. His eyes did not rest upon the distance; they were attracted by a figure seated under the trellis, where the chequers of sun, in the interstices of the vine leaves, fell upon a bright-coloured rug spread out on the ground. The floor of the roughly-constructed verandah was so low that there was virtually no difference in the level. It took Ransom only a moment to recognise Miss Birdseye, though her back was turned to the house. She was alone; she sat there motionless (she had a newspaper in her lap, but her attitude was not that of a reader), looking at the shimmering bay. She might be asleep; that was why Ransom moderated the process of his long legs as he came round through the house to join her. This precaution represented his only scruple. He stepped across the verandah and stood close to her, but she did not appear to notice him. Visibly, she was dozing, or presumably, rather, for her head was enveloped in an old faded straw hat, which concealed the upper part of her face. There were two or three other chairs near her, and a table on which were half-a-dozen books and periodicals, together with a glass containing a colourless liquid, on the top of which a spoon was laid. Ransom desired only to respect her repose, so he sat down in one of the chairs and waited till she should become aware of his presence. He thought Miss Chancellor's back-garden a delightful spot, and his jaded senses tasted the breeze--the idle, wandering summer wind--that stirred the vine leaves over his head. The hazy shores on the other side of the water, which had tints more delicate than the street vistas of New York (they seemed powdered with silver, a sort of midsummer light), suggested to him a land of dreams, a country in a picture. Basil Ransom had seen very few pictures, there were none in Mississippi; but he had a vision at times of something that would be more refined than the real world, and the situation in which he now found himself pleased him almost as much as if it had been a <b>striking</b> <b>work</b> of art. He was unable to see, as I have said, whether Miss Birdseye were taking in the prospect through open or only, imagination aiding (she had plenty of that), through closed, tired, dazzled eyes. She appeared to him, as the minutes elapsed and he sat beside her, the incarnation of well-earned rest, of patient, submissive superannuation. At the end of her long day's work she might have been placed there to enjoy this dim prevision of the peaceful river, the gleaming shores, of the paradise her unselfish life had certainly qualified her to enter, and which, apparently, would so soon be opened to her. After a while she said, placidly, without turning: ...|$|E

5000|$|On 7 October 1840, as a {{consequence}} of an increased interest in the Church of Scotland concerning the conversion of the Jews, and of his own deep interest in Israel, Duncan was appointed the first Missionary to the Jews from the Church of Scotland.

50|$|From 1885 to 1887, Pater {{published}} {{four new}} imaginary portraits in Macmillan's Magazine, each {{set at a}} turning-point {{in the history of}} ideas or art, and each a study of misfits, men born out of their time, who bring disaster upon themselves - 'A Prince of Court Painters' (1885) (on Watteau and Jean-Baptiste Pater), 'Sebastian van Storck' (1886) (17th-century Dutch society and painting, and the philosophy of Spinoza), 'Denys L'Auxerrois' (1886) (Dionysus and the medieval cathedral-builders), and 'Duke Carl of Rosenmold' (1887) (the German Renaissance). These were collected in the volume Imaginary Portraits (1887). Here Pater's examination of the tensions between tradition and innovation, intellect and sensation, asceticism and aestheticism, social mores and amorality, becomes increasingly complex. Implied warnings against the pursuit of extremes in matters intellectual, aesthetic or sensual are unmistakable. The second portrait, 'Sebastian van Storck', a powerful critique of philosophical solipsism, is perhaps Pater's most <b>striking</b> <b>work</b> of fiction.|$|E

A journalist for The Sunday Times missed the Royal Festival Hall concert, but thought on record the music [...] "comes over magnificently ... a <b>striking</b> <b>work</b> which only occasionally lapses into pretentiousness". Music journalist Chris Welch of Melody Maker thought the album was [...] "entertaining, fresh and disalarmingly unpretentious ...

50|$|Karl Olivecrona (25 October 1897, Norrbärke - 1980) was a Swedish {{lawyer and}} legal philosopher. He studied law at Uppsala from 1915 to 1920 {{and was a}} pupil of Axel Hägerström, the spiritual father of Scandinavian legal realism. One of the internationally best-known Swedish legal theorists, Olivecrona was a {{professor}} of procedural law and legal philosophy at Lund University. His writings emphasise the psychological significance of legal ideas. His most <b>striking</b> <b>work</b> on legal theory, {{the first edition of}} his book Law as Fact (of 1939, almost entirely different in content from the similarly titled 1971 work), stressed the importance of a monopoly of force as the fundamental basis of law. Olivecrona's politics during World War II showed a related stress on a need for overwhelming coercive power to guarantee order in international relations. He became convinced that Europe required an unchallengeable controlling force to ensure its peace and unity, and that Germany alone could provide this. His pamphlet England eller Tyskland (England or Germany), published in the darkest days of the war, argued that England had lost its claim to exert leadership in Europe and that the future required an acceptance of German hegemony.|$|E
