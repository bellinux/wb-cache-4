50|$|During {{the cycle}} 1 (left-looking) radar <b>surface</b> <b>mapping</b> on Venus (September 15, 1990 to May 15, 1991), around 70% of the Venusian <b>surface</b> was <b>mapped</b> by Synthetic {{aperture}} radar.

Combining cycle 1 and 2 results in a total coverage of 96% of Venusian <b>surface</b> <b>mapped.</b> Cycle 3 (left looking) filled remaining gaps and collected stereo imagery of approximately 21.3% of the surface, increasing the total coverage to 98%.|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Body <b>surface</b> isopotential <b>surface</b> <b>maps</b> {{are related}} to {{electrical}} events within the heart. The conventional electro-cardiogram and vectorcardiogram were compared with the total body potential distribution as de-picted by isopotential <b>surface</b> <b>maps</b> by using a normal child and a patient with mild right ven-tricular hypertrophy (secundum atrial defect). During {{the latter half of}} QRS the <b>surface</b> <b>maps</b> were different between the normal and abnormal, although the vectorcardiographs curves were similar. Useful clinical information is present on the body surface that is not evident in vectorcar-diogram. In some situations the reduction of in-formation to an instantaneous vector may not onl...|$|R

40|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>mapping</b> of the {{exercise}} electrocardiogram (ECG) provides {{a measure of the}} precordial area, severity, and time course of ST-segment changes occurring after exercise. Sixteen-lead isopotential <b>surface</b> <b>maps</b> were recorded before and after exercise in 109 patients with probable angina who subsequently underwent coronary arteriography. In addition, exercise ECGs with three orthogonal leads were obtained in 53 of these patients, and with a single unipolar chest lead in all 109. Of the 109 patients, 85 had significant (greater than or equal to 70 %) narrowing of at least one major coronary artery. The sensitivities of the precordial <b>surface</b> <b>mapping,</b> orthogonal leads, and single chest lead (V 5) when compared with the findings at coronary arteriography were 95 %, 68 %, and 64 % respectively, while the specificities of the three lead systems did not differ significantly.

40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{influence}} of body <b>surface</b> <b>mapping</b> on outcome of ventricular antiarrhythmic surgery. Preoperative mapping is advocated to optimize map-guided antiarrhythmic surgery of postinfarction ventricular tachycardia. We sequentially analyzed the results of catheter activation sequence <b>mapping,</b> body <b>surface</b> <b>mapping,</b> and intraoperative multielectrode mapping in 54 patients and made a comparison with 30 control patients (group B) in whom catheter activation sequence mapping was omitted. Endpoints were actuarial survival, freedom of arrhythmia, and comparability of the localisation of sites of ventricular tachycardia origin. A total of 128 morphologically different monomorphic sustained ventricular tachycardias were mapped in group A. In group A, 87 ventricular tachycardias were mapped preoperatively with body <b>surface</b> <b>mapping</b> and 30 ventricular tachycardias with catheter activation sequence mapping. In 19 of 24 ventricular tachycardias (79 %) that were localized with both mapping methods the ventricular tachycardia exit site was similar. In-hospital death was 1 of 85 (1. 2 %). Actuarial freedom from ventricular arrhythmias at 4 -year follow-up was 74. 1 +/- 6. 0 % in group A vs. 90. 0 +/- 5. 5 % in group B (P =. 10). In group A 14 of 54 patients died (29. 6 %), whereas 4 of 30 patients (13. 3 %) died in group B (P =. 09). Arrhythmia freedom and survival is as good in patients <b>mapped</b> with body <b>surface</b> <b>mapping</b> only as in patients <b>mapped</b> with body <b>surface</b> <b>mapping</b> and catheter activation sequence mappin...|$|R

The anticanonical divisor is not very ample, and its linear system defines a map from the del Pezzo surface to the projective plane, branched over a quartic plane curve.

50|$|Dragonshard {{combines}} {{aspects of}} real-time strategy (RTS), and role-playing games (RPGs). Games {{take place on}} dual level maps divided into the surface world of Eberron, and the underground realm of Khyber. Units travel between the surface, and the underground through gateways that are fixed on each map. The <b>surface</b> <b>map</b> features traditional RTS gameplay: the player builds and develops base structures, gathers resources, and amasses, and upgrades an army. Unlike most real-time strategy games, all units {{are available at the}} beginning of the game, rather than having prerequisites to allow their construction.
