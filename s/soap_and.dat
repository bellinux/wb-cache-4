40|$|Post {{inflammatory}} hyper pigmentation following photo toxic reaction due to cosmetics {{may account}} for pigmentation in some cases. The objective {{was to determine the}} absorption spectrum of commonly used <b>soaps</b> <b>and</b> hair oils available in Indian marker. By using UV-visible absorption spectrophotometer, the absorption spectrum of <b>soaps</b> <b>and</b> hair oils were determined. The mean absorption spectrum was 218 nm. Since none of the commonly used <b>soaps</b> <b>and</b> hair oils showed significant absorption in the range of 290 - 400 nm, we conclude that products tested are not responsible for photo toxic reaction or photo toxicity induced hyper pigmentation...|$|R

40|$|Although {{previous}} research {{showed that the}} thin ideal provided by the media affects body image and eating behaviour in young children, less is known about specific media contents {{that are related to}} body image and eating behaviour. This study tested the associations between watching <b>soaps</b> <b>and</b> music television and body dissatisfaction and restrained eating directly, and indirectly through thin ideal internalisation. We conducted a survey in class, in which 245 girls (aged 7 - 9) completed scales on their television watching behaviour, thin ideal internalisation, body dissatisfaction and restrained eating. Additionally, height and weight were measured. Watching <b>soaps</b> <b>and</b> music television often was associated with higher thin ideal internalisation, which in turn was associated with higher body dissatisfaction and restrained eating. Furthermore, a direct association between watching <b>soaps</b> <b>and</b> music television and restrained eating was found. If watching other types of children's programmes or maternal encouragement to be thin were included in the models, watching <b>soaps</b> <b>and</b> music television remained an important factor, especially with regard to restrained eating. Therefore, our results suggest that if young girls watch <b>soaps</b> <b>and</b> music television often, this is related to higher restrained eating and body dissatisfaction, directly or indirectly, through higher thin ideal internalisation...|$|R

5|$|Sodium {{compounds}} are {{of immense}} commercial importance, being particularly central to industries producing glass, paper, <b>soap,</b> <b>and</b> textiles. The most important sodium compounds are table salt (NaCl), soda ash (Na2CO3), baking soda (NaHCO3), caustic soda (NaOH), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), di- and tri-sodium phosphates, sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3·5H2O), and borax (Na2B4O7·10H2O).

5|$|Burns are {{generally}} preventable. Treatment {{depends on the}} severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with <b>soap</b> <b>and</b> water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection. Tetanus toxoid should be given if not up to date.|$|E

5|$|In {{medieval times}} trades {{were carried out}} in {{workshops}} {{in and around the}} owners' premises in the City. By the time of the Great Fire these were becoming industries and some were particularly noisome, such as the processing of urine to perform tanning; or required large amounts of space, such as drying clothes after process and dying in fields known as tentergrounds; and rope making. Some were dangerous, such as the manufacture of gunpowder or the proving of guns. These activities came to be performed outside the City walls in the near suburbs of the East End. Later when lead making and bone processing for <b>soap</b> <b>and</b> china came to be established, they too located in the East End rather than the crowded streets of the City.|$|E
