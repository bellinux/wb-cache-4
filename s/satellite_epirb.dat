50|$|In {{addition}} to equipment listed below, all GMDSS-regulated ships must carry a <b>satellite</b> <b>EPIRB,</b> a NAVTEX receiver (if they travel in any areas served by NAVTEX), an Inmarsat-C SafetyNET receiver (if they travel in any areas not served by NAVTEX), a DSC-equipped VHF radiotelephone, two (if between 300 {{and less than}} 500 GRT) or three VHF handhelds (if 500 GRT or more), and two 9 GHz search and rescue radar transponders (SART).|$|E
50|$|The GPS system permits stationary, wide-view {{geosynchronous}} communications satellites {{to enhance}} the doppler position received by low Earth orbit <b>satellites.</b> <b>EPIRB</b> beacons with built-in GPS are usually called GPIRBs, for GPS position-indicating radio beacon or global position-indicating radio beacon.|$|R
50|$|An officer must be {{expert in}} the use of {{survival}} craft and rescue boats, their launching appliances and arrangements, and their equipment including radio life-saving appliances, <b>satellite</b> <b>EPIRBs,</b> SARTs, immersion suits and thermal protective aids. It's important to be {{expert in the}} techniques for survival at sea techniques in case it's necessary to abandon ship.|$|R
50|$|For these reasons, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a United Nations agency {{specializing in}} safety of {{shipping}} and preventing ships from polluting the seas, began looking at ways of improving maritime distress and safety communications. In 1979, {{a group of}} experts drafted the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue, which called for development of a global search and rescue plan. This group also passed a resolution calling for development by IMO of a Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) to provide the communication support needed to implement the search and rescue plan. This new system, which the world's maritime nations are implementing, is based upon a combination of satellite and terrestrial radio services, and has changed international distress communications from being primarily ship-to-ship based to ship-to-shore (Rescue Coordination Center) based. It spelled the end of Morse code communications for {{all but a few}} users, such as amateur radio operators. The GMDSS provides for automatic distress alerting and locating in cases where a radio operator doesn't have time to send an SOS or MAYDAY call, and, for the first time, requires ships to receive broadcasts of maritime safety information which could prevent a distress from happening in the first place. In 1988, IMO amended the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention, requiring ships subject to it fit GMDSS equipment. Such ships were required to carry NAVTEX and <b>satellite</b> <b>EPIRBs</b> by August 1, 1993, and had to fit all other GMDSS equipment by February 1, 1999. US ships were allowed to fit GMDSS in lieu of Morse telegraphy equipment by the Telecommunications Act of 1996.|$|R
50|$|Visitors to the outback often {{drive their}} own or rented vehicles, or take {{organised}} tours. Travel through remote areas on main roads is easily done and requires no planning. However travel through very remote areas, on isolated tracks, requires planning and a suitable, reliable vehicle (usually a four-wheel drive). On very remote routes considerable supplies and equipment may be required; this can include prearranged caches. It is not advisable to travel into these especially remote areas with a single vehicle, unless fully equipped with good communication technology (e.g. a <b>satellite</b> phone, <b>EPIRB</b> etc.). Many visitors prefer to travel in these areas in a convoy. Deaths of tourists and locals becoming stranded on outback trips occasionally occur, sometimes because insufficient water and food supplies were taken, or because people have walked away from their vehicle in search of help. Travellers through very remote areas should always inform a reliable person of their route and expected destination arrival time, and remember that a vehicle {{is much easier to}} locate in an aerial search, than a person, so {{in the event of a}} breakdown, they must not leave their vehicle.|$|R
50|$|Cospas-Sarsat is an {{international}} satellite-based search and rescue system, established by Canada, France, the United States, and Russia. These four countries jointly helped develop the 406 MHz Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB), {{an element of the}} GMDSS designed to operate with Cospas-Sarsat system. These automatic-activating EPIRBs, now required on SOLAS ships, commercial fishing vessels, and all passenger ships, are designed to transmit to alert rescue coordination centers via the satellite system from anywhere in the world. The original COSPAS/SARSAT system used polar orbiting satellites but in recent years the system has been expanded to also include 4 geostationary satellites. Newest designs incorporate GPS receivers to transmit highly accurate positions (within about 20 metres) of the distress position. The original COSPAS/SARSAT <b>satellites</b> could calculate <b>EPIRB</b> position to within about 3 nmi km by using Doppler techniques. By the end of 2010 EPIRB manufacturers may be offering AIS (automatic identification system) enabled beacons. The serviceability of these items is checked monthly and annually and they have limited battery shelf life, between two and five years using mostly lithium-type batteries. 406 MHz EPIRB's transmit a registration number which is linked to a database of information about the vessel.|$|R
