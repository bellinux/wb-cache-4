40|$|Background/Aims: The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{investigate}} whether the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in lipid metabolism related genes would affect the effectiveness of atorvastatin in both Han and Uighur populations. Methods: 200 ischemic stroke patients were treated with atorvastatin. The differences of blood lipid level and their ratios were measured. Six lipid related genes, HMGCR, APOA 5, LPL, CETP, LDLR and PCSK 9 were selected as candidate genes. And nine SNP loci in these six genes were genotyped by SNaPshot technique. Results: In all patients treated with atorvastatin, the SNP rs 662799 <b>significantly</b> <b>affected</b> the ratio of &#x 0394;LDL and &#x 0394;LDL/LDL (p < 0. 05); the SNP rs 320 <b>significantly</b> <b>affected</b> the ratio of &#x 0394;LDL/LDL and &#x 0394;(LDL/HDL) /(LDL/HDL) (p < 0. 01) and the SNP rs 708272 <b>significantly</b> <b>affected</b> the ratio of &#x 0394;LDL (p < 0. 05). In Han population treated with atorvastatin, the SNP rs 662799 <b>significantly</b> <b>affected</b> the ratio of &#x 0394;TG (p < 0. 05); the SNP rs 320 <b>significantly</b> <b>affected</b> the ratio of &#x 0394;LDL/LDL and &#x 0394;(LDL/HDL) /(LDL/HDL) (p < 0. 01). In Uighur population treated with atorvastatin, the SNP rs 2266788 <b>significantly</b> <b>affected</b> the ratio of &#x 0394;HDL (p < 0. 05); the SNP rs 662799 <b>significantly</b> <b>affected</b> the ratio of &#x 0394;LDL/LDL (p < 0. 05) and the SNP rs 708272 <b>significantly</b> <b>affected</b> the ratio of &#x 0394;LDL (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: Polymorphisms of rs 662799 and rs 2266788 in APOA 5 gene, rs 320 in LPL gene and rs 708272 in CETP gene had significant association with the effect of the lipid-lowering therapy via atorvastatin calcium on ischemic stroke patients...|$|R
5|$|DOE {{has stated}} that seismic and tectonic effects on the natural systems at Yucca Mountain will not <b>significantly</b> <b>affect</b> {{repository}} performance. Yucca Mountain lies in a region of ongoing tectonic deformation, but the deformation rates are too slow to <b>significantly</b> <b>affect</b> the mountain during the 10,000-year regulatory compliance period. Rises in the water table caused by seismic activity would be, at most, a few tens of meters and would not reach the repository. The fractured and faulted volcanic tuff that Yucca Mountain comprises reflects the occurrence of many earthquake-faulting and strong ground motion events during the last several million years, and the hydrological characteristics of the rock would not be changed significantly by seismic events that may occur in the next 10,000 years. The engineered barrier system components will reportedly provide substantial protection of the waste from seepage water, even under severe seismic loading.|$|E

While castles continued to be built well into the 16thcentury, new techniques to deal with improved cannon fire made them uncomfortable and undesirable places to live. As a result, true castles went into decline and were replaced by artillery forts with no role in civil administration, and country houses that were indefensible. From the 18thcentury onwards, there was {{a renewed interest in}} castles with the construction of mock castles, part of a romantic revival of Gothic architecture, but they had no military purpose.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{the rapid}} motion of Nanmadol, the typhoon crossed Luzon in under six hours, {{emerging}} into the South China Sea before 1800UTC on December2. Though land interaction with the Philippines did not <b>significantly</b> <b>affect</b> the cyclone, a shortwave trough forced Nanmadol to sharply curve northward, bringing it into hostile atmospheric conditions within the Luzon Strait. At 0000UTC on December3, the JMA downgraded Nanmadol to severe tropical storm status. Increased wind shear and the advection of dry air further weakened the tropical cyclone, and by midday on December3, the storm's center of circulation became decoupled {{from the rest of}} the convection. At 2340UTC that day, Nanmadol made landfall near Fangliao, Pingtung in Taiwan, becoming the first December tropical cyclone to strike the island in 108years of record-keeping. Roughly six hours later on December4, the JMA determined that Nanmadol had transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. These remnants soon merged with another low-pressure area, creating a more powerful system that later tracked over Japan.|$|E
5|$|The 1991 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the first}} season in over 24years in which no hurricanes developed from tropical waves, which are the source for most North Atlantic tropical cyclones.

The first storm, Ana, developed on July2 off the southeast United States and dissipated without causing significant effects. Two other tropical storms in the season– Danny and Erika– did not <b>significantly</b> <b>affect</b> land. Danny dissipated east of the Lesser Antilles, and Erika passed through the Azores before becoming extratropical. In addition, there were four non-developing tropical depressions.

5|$|The bluntnose {{stingray}} is not aggressive, {{though it}} will defend itself if stepped on or otherwise incited. Its tail spine can inflict an excruciating injury, and can easily pierce leather or rubber footwear. The paralytic venom delivered may have potentially life-threatening effects on those with heart or respiratory problems, and {{is the subject of}} biomedical and neurobiological research. This species is popular with ecotourist divers. Abundant and widespread, the bluntnose stingray is caught incidentally by commercial trawl and gillnet fisheries operating in nearshore U.S. waters; these activities are not a threat to its population, as most captured rays are released alive. The impact of fishing in the southern parts of its range is uncertain, but is unlikely to <b>significantly</b> <b>affect</b> the species as a whole as these activities occur outside its centers of distribution. As a result, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed the bluntnose stingray as of Least Concern.|$|E

5|$|The {{explosive}} {{nature of}} past eruptions at Silverthrone Caldera {{suggests that this}} volcano poses a significant long-distance threat to communities across Canada. A large explosive eruption can produce large amounts of ash that could <b>significantly</b> <b>affect</b> communities across Canada. Ash columns could rise to several hundred meters above the volcano which would make this a hazard for air traffic along the coastal airway between Vancouver and Alaska. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure as well as damage to other aircraft systems. In addition, pyroclastic fall could also have a deleterious effect on the Ha-Iltzuk Icefield surrounding the volcano. Melting of glacial ice could cause lahars or debris flows. This in turn could endanger water supplies on the Machmell River and other local water sources.|$|E
5|$|Thermotropic mesophases are {{detected}} and {{characterized by}} two major methods, the original method was use of thermal optical microscopy, {{in which a}} small sample of the material was placed between two crossed polarizers; the sample was then heated and cooled. As the isotropic phase would not <b>significantly</b> <b>affect</b> the polarization of the light, it would appear very dark, whereas the crystal and liquid crystal phases will both polarize the light in a uniform way, leading to brightness and color gradients. This method allows for the characterization of the particular phase, as the different phases are defined by their particular order, which must be observed. The second method, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), allows for more precise determination of phase transitions and transition enthalpies. In DSC, a small sample is heated in a way that generates a very precise change in temperature with respect to time. During phase transitions, the heat flow required to maintain this heating or cooling rate will change. These changes can be observed and attributed to various phase transitions, such as key liquid crystal transitions.|$|E
