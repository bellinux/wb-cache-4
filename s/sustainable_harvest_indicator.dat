50|$|The key {{assumption}} {{behind all}} <b>sustainable</b> <b>harvesting</b> models such as MSY is that populations of organisms grow and replace themselves - that is, they are renewable resources. Additionally {{it is assumed}} that because the growth rates, survival rates, and reproductive rates increase when harvesting reduces population density, they produce a surplus of biomass that can be <b>harvested.</b> Otherwise, <b>sustainable</b> <b>harvest</b> would not be possible.|$|R

In-situ conservation of medicinal plants in and around the mountains and national park areas and ex-situ techniques involving cryopreservation and conducting ethno medical survey to explore utilization of medicinal plants. This involves the research on the propagation and cultivation methods of selected indigenous medicinal plants for human and livestock disease. Impact on wild populations of medicinal plants through harvesting and other activities that involves the conservation of medicinal plants on-farm pilot propagation and cultivation trials of medicinal plants on past, present and future scenario. Development and implementation of appropriate management options and guidelines for <b>sustainable</b> <b>harvesting</b> of medicinal plants by applying various conservation techniques. The output will be field gene bank established serving research and conservation. Guidelines for <b>sustainable</b> <b>harvest</b> of medicinal plants and its Cultivation practices can be developed by providing income generating activities such as incentives and also creating market opportunities for both import and export and for formalizing traditional medicine.

40|$|Preliminary version Public {{authorities}} (often local) frequently mandate {{public or}} private agencies to manage their natural resources. Contrary to the agency, which {{is an expert in}} resource management, public authorities usually do not know the <b>sustainable</b> <b>harvest</b> level. In this paper, we model the contractual relationship between a principal, who owns the resource, and an agent, who holds private information on its <b>sustainable</b> <b>harvest</b> level, and look for the Pareto-optimal allocations. The agent can strategically use his private information to harvest outside the sustainability interval. We consider the case where the agent interacts with several principals simultaneously. From a simple dynamic spatial game, we show how the existence of multiple interacting principals with diverse qualities on information can help the least well-informed principals to reduce the information rent and lead to the Pareto-optimal allocation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. With the {{increased}} realization that many wild medicinal and aromatic plant (MAP) species are being over-exploited, {{a number of}} agencies are recommending that wild species be brought into cultivation systems. Others argue <b>sustainable</b> <b>harvest</b> {{to be the most}} important conservation strategy for most wild-harvested species, given their contributions to local economies and their greater value to harvesters over the long term. Besides poverty and the breakdown of traditional controls, the major challenges for sustainable wild-collection include: lack of knowledge about <b>sustainable</b> <b>harvest</b> rates and practices, undefined land use rights and lack of legislative and policy guidance. Identifying the conservation benefits and costs of the different production systems for MAP should help guide policies as to whether species conservation should take place in nature or the nursery, or both...|$|R

40|$|Excess {{capacity}} of fishing fleets {{is one of}} the most pressing problems facing the world's fisheries and the <b>sustainable</b> <b>harvesting</b> of resource stocks. Considerable confusion persists over the definition and measurement of capacity and capacity utilization in fishing. Fishing capacity and capacity utilization, rather than capital (or effort) utilization, provide the appropriate framework. This paper provides both technological-economic and economic definitions of capacity and excess capacity in fishing and illustrates the technological-economic approach through a case study using Data Envelopment Analysis. 1 Excess {{capacity of}} fishing fleets {{is one of the}} most pressing problems facing the world's fisheries and the <b>sustainable</b> <b>harvesting</b> of resource stocks.
