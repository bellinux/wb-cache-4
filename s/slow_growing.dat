Changes in primary production in the photic zone are expected to alter the standing stocks in the food-limited aphotic zone.|$|E

25|$|Most {{species of}} {{micro-organism}} on Earth {{are not yet}} well understood or DNA sequenced. This particularly applies to the uncultivable archaea, {{and the majority of}} micro-organisms are uncultivable, and so are hard to study.

In typical habitats, 99% of micro-organisms are uncultivable.|$|E
25|$|In India {{and east}} Asia Helicias have been {{cultivated}} in botanic gardens, from the 1800s. In Australia they have rarely been cultivated, and {{were thought to}} have little horticultural value. The rusty-coloured new growth is attractive on some species.

25|$|The Pacific yew is a {{small to}} {{medium-sized}} evergreen tree, growing 10–15m tall and with a trunk up to 50cm diameter, rarely more. In some instances, trees with heights in excess of 20m occur in parks and other protected areas, quite often in gullies. The tree is extremely <b>slow</b> <b>growing,</b> and has a habit of rotting from the inside, creating hollow forms. This makes it difficult and sometimes impossible to make accurate rings counts to determine a specimen's true age. Often damaged by succession of the forest, it usually ends up in a squat, multiple leader form.|$|E
25|$|Bottom fishing has {{operated}} {{for over a}} century on heavily fished grounds such as the North Sea and Grand Banks. While overfishing has long been recognised as causing major ecological changes to the fish community on the Grand Banks, concern has been raised more recently about the damage which benthic trawling inflicts upon seabed communities. A species of particular concern is the <b>slow</b> <b>growing,</b> deep water coral Lophelia pertusa. This species is home to a diverse community of deep sea organisms, but is easily damaged by fishing gear. On 17 November 2004, the United Nations General Assembly urged nations to consider temporary bans on high seas bottom trawling.|$|E
25|$|Exophiala dermatitidis forms <b>slow</b> <b>growing,</b> {{brown or}} black colonies. As is common amongst black yeasts, E. dermatitidis is an {{anamorphic}} fungus with multiple conidial forms. This morphological plasticity has complicated taxonomic determination {{based solely on}} physical appearance. Young colonies are described as waxy, mucoid, smooth, and yeastlike. Over time pigmented aerial hyphae develop, and older colonies are described as appearing filamentous and velvety. Conidia are between globular and elliptical in shape, and form {{at the mouth of}} short annellidic conidiogenous cells. Annellations can only be observed by electron microscopy. Prior to analysis by scanning electron microscope, the condiogenous cells were observed to form from non-annelated phialides and phialides without collarettes. These observations caused the species to be erroneously provided with its own monotypic genus, Wangiella. The species name Wangiella dermatitidis is still commonly used in the scientific literature.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Bacterial species {{present in}} multispecies {{microbial}} communities often {{react to the}} same chemical signal but at vastly different concentrations. The existence of different response thresholds {{with respect to the}} same signal molecule has been well documented in quorum sensing {{which is one of the}} best studied inter-cellular signalling mechanisms in bacteria. The biological significance of this phenomenon is still poorly understood, and cannot be easily studied in nature or in laboratory models. The aim of this study is to establish the role of differential signal response thresholds in stabilizing microbial communities. Results We tested binary competition scenarios using an agent-based model in which competing bacteria had different response levels with respect to signals, cooperation factors or both, respectively. While in previous scenarios fitter species outcompete <b>slower</b> <b>growing</b> competitors, we found that stable equilibria could form if the fitter species responded to a higher chemical concentration level than the <b>slower</b> <b>growing</b> competitor. We also found that species secreting antibiotic could form a stable community with other competing species if antibiotic production started at higher response thresholds. Conclusions Microbial communities in nature rely on the stable coexistence of species that necessarily differ in their fitness. We found that differential response thresholds provide a simple and elegant way for keeping <b>slower</b> <b>growing</b> species within the community. High response thresholds can be considered as self-restraint of the fitter species that allows metabolically useful but <b>slower</b> <b>growing</b> species to remain within a community, and thereby the metabolic repertoire of the community will be maintained.

25|$|The Friuli-Venezia Giulia {{region is}} bordered by the Alps {{to the north}} {{separating}} it from Austria. Slovenia borders the region on {{the east and the}} Italian region of Veneto forms the western border and part of the southern border with the Adriatic Sea. The northern half is very mountainous and gives way to flatter terrain and plains {{on the way to the}} sea. The climate is distinguished with very warm days and chilly nights that help maintain a balance in the grape between acidity and sugar levels and allows the grapes a long, <b>slow</b> <b>growing</b> season. In summertime the mean temperature is around 73°F (22.8°C) with rainfall averaging 60inches (1,530mm). Harvest normally takes place in September. The soils of the region vary from the calcium rich marl and flysch sandstone in the more hilly regions to clay, sand and gravel in the valley. The names of Friuli vineyards and wine estates often include the word ronco (plural ronchi), which is the Friulian word for a terraced hillside.|$|E
25|$|Gas vacuoles are membrane-bound, {{spindle-shaped}} vesicles, {{found in}} some planktonic bacteria and Cyanobacteria, that provides buoyancy to these cells by decreasing their overall cell density. Positive buoyancy is {{needed to keep the}} cells in {{the upper reaches of the}} water column, so that they can continue to perform photosynthesis. They are made up of a shell of protein that has a highly hydrophobic inner surface, making it impermeable to water (and stopping water vapour from condensing inside) but permeable to most gases. Because the gas vesicle is a hollow cylinder, it is liable to collapse when the surrounding pressure increases. Natural selection has fine tuned the structure of the gas vesicle to maximise its resistance to buckling, including an external strengthening protein, GvpC, rather like the green thread in a braided hosepipe. There is a simple relationship between the diameter of the gas vesicle and pressure at which it will collapse - the wider the gas vesicle the weaker it becomes. However, wider gas vesicles are more efficient, providing more buoyancy per unit of protein than narrow gas vesicles. Different species produce gas vesicle of different diameter, allowing them to colonise different depths of the water column (fast growing, highly competitive species with wide gas vesicles in the top most layers; <b>slow</b> <b>growing,</b> dark-adapted, species with strong narrow gas vesicles in the deeper layers). The diameter of the gas vesicle will also help determine which species survive in different bodies of water. Deep lakes that experience winter mixing expose the cells to the hydrostatic pressure generated by the full water column. This will select for species with narrower, stronger gas vesicles.|$|E

500|$|B. paludosa is {{cultivated}} in Australian gardens, and does best with a sunny aspect and good drainage, in soils with a pH from 5.5 to 7.5. <b>Slow</b> <b>growing,</b> it flowers in 6 to 10 years from seed. It can be propagated by seed, which take around {{two weeks to}} germinate, or cutting. Low growing coastal (dwarf) forms which grow to 60cm (2ft) are also commercially available, and should be propagated by cutting to preserve features. Noting the flower spikes to be [...] "rather dull", plant author John Wrigley has described the species as [...] "not a spectacular garden plant", although its foliage {{has been described as}} [...] "attractive".
