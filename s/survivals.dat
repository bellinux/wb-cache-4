5|$|Born to {{a wealthy}} middle-class family in Vienna, List {{claimed that he}} {{abandoned}} his family's Roman Catholic faith in childhood, instead devoting himself to the pre-Christian god Wotan. Spending {{much time in the}} Austrian countryside, he engaged in rowing, hiking, and sketching the landscape. From 1877 he began a career as a journalist, primarily authoring articles on the Austrian countryside for nationalist newspapers and magazines. In these he placed a völkisch emphasis on the folk culture and customs of rural people, believing that many of them were <b>survivals</b> of pre-Christian, pagan religion. He published three novels, Carnuntum (1888), Jung Diethers Heimkehr (1894), and Pipara (1895), each set among the German tribes of the Iron Age, as well as authoring several plays. During the 1890s he continued writing völkisch articles, now largely for the nationalist Ostdeutsche Rundschau newspaper, with his works taking on an anti-semitic dimension halfway through that decade. In 1893, he co-founded the Literarische Donaugesellschaft literary society, and involved himself in Austria's Pan-German nationalist movement, a milieu which sought the integration of Austria into the German Empire.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{discouraged}} {{the burial}} of grave goods so {{the majority of}} examples of insular metalwork that survive from the Christian period {{have been found in}} archaeological contexts that suggest they were rapidly hidden, lost or abandoned. There are a few exceptions, notably portable shrines ("cumdachs") for books or relics, several of which have been continuously owned, mostly by churches on the Continent—though the Monymusk Reliquary has always been in Scotland. The highest quality <b>survivals</b> are either secular jewellery, the largest and most elaborate pieces probably for male wearers, tableware or altarware. The finest church pieces were probably made by secular workshops, often attached to a royal household, though other pieces were made by monastic workshops. There are a number of large brooches, each of their designs is wholly individual in detail, and the workmanship is varied. Many elements of the designs can be directly related to elements used in manuscripts. Surviving stones used in decoration are semi-precious ones, with amber and rock crystal among the commonest, and some garnets. Coloured glass, enamel and millefiori glass, probably imported, are also used. None of the major insular manuscripts, like the Book of Kells, have preserved their elaborate jewelled metal covers, but documentary evidence indicates that these were as spectacular as the few remaining continental examples.|$|E
40|$|<b>Survival</b> {{during the}} first year after first calving was {{investigated}} over the last 25 years, 1989 – 2013, as well as how the association of <b>survival</b> with season of calving, age at first calving (AFC) and within-herd production level has changed over that period. The data set contained 1 108 745 Dutch black-and-white cows in 2185 herds. Linear models were used to estimate (1) effect of year and season and their interaction and (2) effect of AFC, within-herd production level, and 5 -year intervals and their two-way interactions, and the genetic trend. All models contained AFC and percentage of Holstein Friesian as a fixed effect, and herd-year-season, sire and maternal grandsire as random effects. <b>Survival</b> and functional <b>survival</b> were analysed. Functional <b>survival</b> was defined as <b>survival</b> adjusted for within-herd production level. <b>Survival</b> rate increased by 8 % up to 92 % in the last 25 years. When accounting for pedigree, <b>survival</b> showed no improvement up to 1999, but improved since then. Genetically, <b>survival</b> increased 3 % to 4 % but functional <b>survival</b> did not increase over the 25 years. We found an interesting difference between the genetic trends for <b>survival</b> and functional <b>survival</b> for bulls born between 1985 and 1999, where the trend for <b>survival</b> was still increasing, but was negative for functional <b>survival.</b> Since 1999, genetic trend picked up again for both <b>survival</b> and functional <b>survival.</b> AFC, season of calving and within-herd production level affected <b>survival.</b> <b>Survival</b> rate decreased 0. 6 %/month for <b>survival</b> and 1. 5 % for functional <b>survival</b> between AFC of 24 and 32 months.

5|$|Only {{fragments}} of artifacts survive from the Brythonic speaking kingdoms of southern Scotland. Pictish {{art can be}} seen in the extensive survival of carved Pictish stones, particularly in the north and east of the country. These display a variety of recurring images and patterns, as at Dunrobin (Sutherland) and Aberlemno (Angus). There are a few <b>survivals</b> of Pictish silver, notably a number of massive neck-chains including the Whitecleuch Chain, and also the unique silver plaques from the cairn at Norrie's Law. Irish-Scots art from the kingdom of Dál Riata is much more difficult to identify, but may include items such as the Hunterston brooch, which with other items such as the Monymusk Reliquary, suggest that Dál Riata was one of the places, as a crossroads between cultures, where the Insular style developed. Early examples of Anglo-Saxon art include metalwork, particularly bracelets, clasps and jewellery, that has survived in pagan burials and in exceptional items such as the intricately carved whalebone Franks Casket, thought to have been produced in Northumbria in the early eighth century, which combines pagan, classical and Christian motifs. After the Christian conversion of what is now Scotland in the seventh century, artistic styles in Northumbria interacted with those in Ireland and Scotland to become part of the common style historians have identified as insular or Hiberno-Saxon.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundTraditional <b>survival</b> {{estimates}} after resection for {{pancreatic cancer}} {{are based on}} clinicopathological variables {{at the time of}} diagnosis. Estimates have not reflected time survived after resection, as investigated for other malignancies. The aim {{of the present study was}} to understand how <b>survival</b> estimates change after pancreatic resection for cancer based on time already survived (conditional <b>survival).</b> MethodsPancreatectomies performed for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) between 2001 and 2010 were reviewed. Clinicopathological variables were evaluated to identify predictors of <b>survival.</b> Expected <b>survival</b> according to a validated nomogram for pancreatic cancer as well as conditional <b>survival</b> estimates and actual <b>survival</b> were calculated. ResultsIn all, 186 patients underwent pancreatic resection for PDAC [154 (82. 8 %) Whipple, 26 (14. 0 %) distal and 6 (3. 2 %) total]. Median (range) <b>survival</b> was 22 (3. 4 – 107. 3) months. Predictors of overall <b>survival</b> were: absence of nodal disease [odds ratio (OR) 8. 8], age < 67 years (OR 8. 4) and lower stage (OR 4. 3). Expected <b>survival</b> according to the nomogram was 70 % (1 year), 39. 5 % (2 years) and 24 % (3 years). As time passed, and overall and expected <b>survival</b> decreased, conditional <b>survival</b> increased. DiscussionThe available prognostic system for PDAC underestimated <b>survival</b> compared with actual <b>survival</b> in the present study. Conditional <b>survival</b> estimates, based on accrued lifespan, were better than either predicted or actual <b>survival,</b> suggesting that <b>survival</b> is a dynamic, rather than static, concept. Conditional <b>survival</b> may, therefore, be a useful tool to allow patients and clinicians to project subsequent <b>survival</b> based on time accrued since resection...|$|R

5|$|The {{maker of}} the work is unknown; it is not signed or marked, and goldsmiths of the period rarely did this.

5|$|The most {{significant}} <b>survivals</b> in sculpture are in High crosses, large free-standing stone crosses, usually carved in relief with patterns, biblical iconography and occasionally inscriptions. The tradition {{may have begun}} in Ireland or Anglo-Saxon England and then spread to Scotland. They are found throughout the British Isles and often feature a stone ring around the intersection, forming a Celtic cross, apparently an innovation of Celtic Christianity, that may have begun at Iona. Distribution in Scotland is heaviest in the Highlands and Islands {{and they can be}} dated to the period c. 750 to 1150. All the surviving crosses are of stone, but there are indications that large numbers of wooden crosses may also have existed. In Scotland biblical iconography is less common than in Ireland, but the subject of King David is relatively frequently depicted. In the east the influence of Pictish sculpture can be seen, in areas of Viking occupation and settlement, crosses for the tenth to the twelfth centuries have distinctive Scandinavian patterns, often mixed with native styles. Important examples dated to the eighth century include St Martin's Cross on Iona, the Kildalton Cross from the Hebrides and the Anglo-Saxon Ruthwell Cross. Through the Hiberno-Scottish mission to the continent, insular art was highly influential on subsequent European Medieval art, especially the decorative elements of Romanesque and Gothic styles.|$|E

40|$|Background Two main {{methods of}} {{quantifying}} cancer patient <b>survival</b> are generally used: cancer-specific <b>survival</b> and relative <b>survival.</b> Both techniques {{are used to}} estimate <b>survival</b> in a single population, or to estimate differences in <b>survival</b> between populations. Arguments have been made that the relative <b>survival</b> approach is the only valid choice for population-based cancer <b>survival</b> studies because cancer-specific <b>survival</b> estimates may be invalid if there is mis-classification of the cause of death. However, {{there has been little}} discussion, or evidence, as to how strong such biases may be, or of the potential biases that may result using relative <b>survival</b> techniques, particularly bias arising from the requirement for an external comparison group. Methods In this article we investigate the assumptions underlying both methods of <b>survival</b> analysis. We provide simulations relating to the impact of misclassification of death and non-comparability of expected <b>survival</b> for cause-specific and relative <b>survival</b> approaches, respectively. Results For cause-specific analyses, bias through misclassification of cause of death resulted in error in descriptive analyses particularly of cancers with moderate or poor <b>survival,</b> but had smaller impact in analyses involving group comparisons. Relative <b>survival</b> ratio (RSR) estimations were robust in relation to non-comparability of comparison populations for single RSR but were less so in group comparisons where there was large variation in <b>survival.</b> Conclusions Both cause-specific <b>survival</b> and relative <b>survival</b> are potentially valid epidemiological methods in population-based cancer <b>survival</b> studies, and the choice of method is dependent on the likely magnitude and direction of the biases in the specific analyses to be conducted...|$|R
