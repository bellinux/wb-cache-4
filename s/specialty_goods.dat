40|$|Niche {{marketing}} is supplying {{a good or}} service to a segment or target group of consumers whose needs cannot be met through the mainstream market. Essentially, the market segment has been previously ignored or is unsatisfied with the general market offering. Although most businesses were initially developed in order to service a niche market, the term generally refers to a small-scale business that produces a <b>specialty</b> <b>good</b> or service for {{a limited number of}} consumers. Also known as alternative marketing or direct marketing, niche marketing offers both producers and consumers an opportunity to participate in transactions outside the mainstream market. The <b>specialty</b> <b>good</b> or service may be a variation on an existing product, or it may be an entirely new product. The market segment being serviced may be defined by, but is not limited to, geographic region, religion or ethnicity, age, or other demographics. Niche marketing can be an especially useful tool for small businesses, including agribusinesses. In recent years, the marketing options for small-scale producers have been diminished due to increased corporate consolidation. It is now difficult for small producers to market their products without having to either take price cuts or sell their products to a larger company, resulting in a loss of brand or company identity. In 2000, it was estimated that about 50 % of the value of beef is added after the cattle leave the farm, while rancher profits are additionally decreased by wholesale price fluctuations, middleman fees, and the cattle grading process (Earles and Fanatico, 2000). Niche marketing provides a way to decrease the number of steps a product must take to reach the consumer, leading to an increased producer share of consumer end prices...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This joint {{statement}} from the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (the College) {{has been designed to}} address issues of concern to both <b>specialties.</b> <b>Good</b> obstetric care requires the availability of qualified personnel and equipment to administer general or neuraxial anesthesia. The extent and degree to which anesthesia services are available varies widely among hospitals. However, for any hospital providing obstetric care, certain optimal anesthesia goals should be sought. These include: I. Availability of a licensed practitioner who is credentialed to administer an appropriate anesthetic whenever necessary. For many women, neuraxial anesthesia (epidural, spinal, or combined spinal epidural) will be the most appropriate anesthetic. II. Availability of a licensed practitioner who is credentialed to maintain support of vital functions in any obstetric emergency. III. Availability of anesthesia and surgical personnel to permit the start of a cesarean delivery in a timely manner in accordance with clinical needs and local resources. IV. Because the risks associated with trial of labor after cesarean delivery (TOLAC) and uterine rupture may be unpredictable, the immediate availability of appropriate facilities and personnel...|$|R

50|$|The {{business}} was bought in 1925 by the Wayne family, who were keen to preserve {{an important part}} of Gotham’s retail history. It {{is one of the most}} financially successful divisions at Wayne Enterprises and oldest branches. The business returned to profit in less than a year, and by the end of the second World War, Toole & Sons stores controlled over 60% of all food retail across the city. This was achieved by diversifying the product range and opening up stock to new markets outside Ireland and within the US. The company changed its name to Wayne Foods in 1956. Today, Wayne Foods focuses on the high end market and <b>specialty</b> <b>goods.</b> Although it no longer has the dominance across Gotham as it did from the late 1950s to the mid-1980s, Wayne Foods continues to generate significant revenue for Wayne Enterprises.

40|$|Excerpt] Observers of Central Business District (CBD) {{retailing}} performance {{have reported}} many adjustments in recent decades. Sales have steadily declined, relatively and absolutely, since World War II. The function and trade {{area of the}} CBD has changed, the clientele is different, and retail establishments have adopted new locational strategies. Contributing substantially to the changing character of CBDs has been the pervasive and continuing decentralization of the metropolitan population. Nearly two decades ago, Vance (1962) conceptualized {{the impact of this}} decentralization process as one of relegating the CBD to that of (1) a seller of mass appeal goods to an inner city market and (2) a seller of <b>specialty</b> <b>goods</b> to the metropolitan market. More recently, it appears that a scaling back has also occurred in the <b>specialty</b> <b>goods</b> area. Increasingly, <b>specialty</b> <b>goods</b> sales have been sustained by those who are downtown because of employment or business...|$|E
30|$|Most of the {{literature}} does not consider product characteristics for distribution across multiple channels.
