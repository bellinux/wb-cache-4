It {{is part of}} our global project ParaSites, which explores the potential of using behaviours and strategies of parasites as models for sculptural propositions in the built environment.

Antibodies can be considered as an autoimmune response of urban environments oversaturated with technological inventions that promise fast and easy solutions for complex societal and ecological issues. In the context of "Antibodies @ Hors-carte - Orléans", Antibodies featured in a participatory bike ride around the city.
