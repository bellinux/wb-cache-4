5|$|Even the {{earliest}} anatomists {{were able to}} recognize the cerebellum by its distinctive appearance. Aristotle and Herophilus (quoted in Galen) called it the parencephalis, {{as opposed to the}} encephalon or brain proper. Galen's extensive description is {{the earliest}} that survives. He <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cerebellum was the source of motor nerves.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{were also}} able to verify that Nickell had {{purchased}} Algae Destroyer from a local fish store; it was <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> algaecide had become mixed with the cyanide when Nickell used the same container to crush both substances without washing it in between uses.|$|E
5|$|Just {{before his}} death, Blancornelas <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Tijuana Cartel had placed a US$250,000 bounty on his assassination, and {{publicly}} {{said that he}} wanted to interview Enedina Arellano Félix, a female drug lord of the cartel, to confirm the information.|$|E

5|$|Kitayama and Karasawa {{concluded}} that Japanese people do indeed have warm feelings towards themselves, just like Americans and Europeans, but that these feelings are masked when explicitly asked for. They <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{reason for this}} masking lies in the Japanese tendency to attend to negative, undesirable features by way of improving the self.|$|E
5|$|The other conference tie-in {{was with}} the WAC, which has {{generally}} fielded its champion in the game. The WAC has provided a team for the Humanitarian Bowl every year since 2001. Initially, it was <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> WAC championship team, Boise State, would make its fifth appearance in the bowl played in its home stadium.|$|E
5|$|After {{the flight}} test {{demonstration}} and {{validation of the}} prototypes, on 23 April 1991, Secretary of the USAF Donald Rice announced the YF-22 as {{the winner of the}} ATF competition. The YF-23 design was considered stealthier and faster, while the YF-22 was more maneuverable. The aviation press <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> YF-22 was also more adaptable to the U.S. Navy's Navalized Advanced Tactical Fighter (NATF), but by 1992, the Navy had abandoned NATF.|$|E

5|$|Because {{the cats}} were {{registered}} as Abyssinians in the import certificates, {{and because the}} Meadows had been breeders of Abyssinian, Burmese, and Siamese, some have <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Singapura is a Burmese/Abyssinian cross and it has even been described as such by CFA Judges. The resemblance of some Burmese/Abyssinian cross to the Singapura, {{as well as the}} Singapura's small litter size, which is uncommon in natural breeds, added more doubts to the Meadows' story.|$|E
5|$|In June 2008, three senior health {{officials}} {{announced that they}} would be leaving the province's employment at the expiration of their contracts in August. Liepert blamed their departures on better offers from other employers, although New Democrat leader Brian Mason <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> government's health restructuring may have been to blame. Detractors pointed out that the optics of allowing the employees to depart for more money elsewhere soon after the government had approved a substantial pay hike for cabinet ministers were not good.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the airstrike, Diệm became hostile towards the American {{presence}} in South Vietnam. Diệm claimed that the American media was seeking to bring him down and he introduced new restrictions on press freedom and political association. The media <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> United States would use the incident to justify the deployment of combat troops to South Vietnam in the event the U.S. remained circumspect. Domestically, the incident was reported to have increased plotting against Diệm by his officers.|$|E

5|$|Johnston {{rounded off}} his Ashes {{series with the}} Fifth Test at The Oval. English skipper Norman Yardley elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch, a {{decision}} many regarded as surprising. Precipitation {{in the past week}} rendered play before midday impossible. Former Australian Test batsman and leading commentator Jack Fingleton <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> tourists would have bowled if they had won the toss.|$|E
5|$|On the day {{following}} the meeting, Shea offered his resignation, becoming instead a special advisor to Daniel Goldin. NASA {{reported that he}} had resigned due to health reasons. However, The Scientist offered a different interpretation, quoting sources who <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bluntness of his speech, including criticisms of Goldin, may have been controversial in NASA circles.|$|E
5|$|Some science-fiction {{fans have}} <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Quatermass serials in general, and Quatermass II in {{particular}} — with its elements including a {{conspiracy of silence}} in the government concerning extraterrestrial life, secret government facilities for alien use, and the silencing of any critic who opposes the government's plans — influenced the successful American series The X-Files (1993–2002). Kneale was invited to write for The X-Files during the 1990s, but declined the offer.|$|E

5|$|The next day, the K Foundation's publicist, Mick Houghton, {{claimed that}} the voting for the K Foundation's award was {{supposed}} to produce a tie, to illustrate the hypocrisy of the Turner award committee, but that strangely the result had been a huge margin of victory for Whiteread. He <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> few thousand voters had just liked or rather disliked {{the sound of her}} name.|$|E
5|$|The {{thirteen}} are Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, Abdulhadi al-Mukhodher, Abduljalil al-Miqdad, Abduljalil al-Singace, Abdulla al-Mahroos, Abdulwahab Hussain, Hasan Mushaima, Ibrahim Sharif, Mohamed Habib al-Miqdad, Mohamed Hasan Jawad, Mohamed Ismail, Sa’eed al-Nuri and Salah al-Khawaja. They {{were originally}} twenty-one, but seven were tried in absentia {{and one was}} released in April 2012. The thirteen became popular heroes in Bahrain, and analysts <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> government was concerned that their release might re-energize the protest movement and frustrate government supporters who oppose any royal pardons.|$|E
5|$|The three parliamentarians {{finally left}} the party on 3 May.

Wetterstad drew the lines to Hagen's own {{withdrawal}} from the Anders Lange Party to form the short-lived Reform Party. Coincidentally, Hagen celebrated his 50th birthday on 6 May.|$|E

5|$|About 900 {{vehicles}} {{crossed the}} bridge each day. The bridge collected {{an average of}} $30,000 in monthly tolls and had $22,000 in monthly expenses. The bridge {{was placed on the}} National Register of Historic Places in 2007 in part because of its relationship to historic New Harmony, Indiana as well as the bridge's age. The three-member Commission was established by Congress on April 12, 1941, but Congress repealed the statute providing for an appointment mechanism in 1998. The Commission's general manager, who is 75, <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bridge would close if the three current commissioners would resign or die.|$|E
5|$|After taking {{only seven}} wickets at 61.00 {{in the first}} four Tests, Johnson was dropped for the Fifth Test at The Oval; Ring {{replaced}} him as the team's spinner. English skipper Norman Yardley won the toss and elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch, which was regarded as a surprising move by the majority of the press corps. Precipitation in the previous week caused an extremely wet outfield, which meant that the Test could not start until midday had passed. Former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Australians would have bowled if they had won the toss.|$|E
5|$|As {{the trade}} {{deadline}} approached, it was <b>speculated</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Phillies would surrender older players to obtain younger ones. They made two deals, neither involving {{key components of}} the team. In August they had their best month of the season: a 14–13 record, thanks to strong pitching and adequate hitting. Although the Phillies began September with four pitchers combining for a no-hitter, their month deteriorated from there. The squad had an 11–15 record, finishing the season with 73 wins and 89 losses. Significant personnel changes {{on the field and}} in the front office were expected during the offseason.|$|E
