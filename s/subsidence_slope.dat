Potential suitability and/or unsuitability of lands for new structures {{must be considered in}} areas affected by underground mining. It is well-known that <b>subsidence,</b> <b>slope</b> instability, and surface flooding are frequently observed in underground mining areas. Thus, a map that takes into account such geo-hazards and classifies suitable and unsuitable areas for new structures is needed. Areas affected by underground mining of coal in Stonava near to the border of the Czech Republic and Poland represent specific areas where <b>subsidence,</b> <b>slope</b> instability, and surface flooding problems need a strategy for future utilization of the landscape by means of land use plans. In light of the above reasons, the methodology and preparation of a map model incorporating the effect of landslides and surface flooding has been introduced in this study. This map depicts three levels of influence (important influence, moderate influence, and negligible influence). Chronological variations in the building site categories in the study area have been analyzed as another part of the study. It was further crucial to consider the current built-up area in the underground mining area, and therefore, its relation to building site categories has also been evaluated. Consequently, the building site categories were evaluated in relation to the planned built-up area, which is the most important landscape element in a land-use plan as a tool in the decision-making process.

50|$|Differential fringes {{which remain}} as fringes in the {{differential}} interferogram {{are a result}} of SAR range changes of any displaced point on the ground from one interferogram to the next. In the differential interferogram, each fringe is directly proportional to the SAR wavelength, which is about 5.6 cm for ERS and RADARSAT single phase cycle. Surface displacement away from the satellite look direction causes an increase in path (translating to phase) difference. Since the signal travels from the SAR antenna to the target and back again, the measured displacement is twice the unit of wavelength. This means in differential interferometry one fringe cycle − to + or one wavelength corresponds to a displacement relative to SAR antenna of only half wavelength (2.8 cm). There are various publications on measuring <b>subsidence</b> movement, <b>slope</b> stability analysis, landslide, glacier movement, etc. tooling D-InSAR. Further advancement to this technique whereby differential interferometry from satellite SAR ascending pass and descending pass can be used to estimate 3-D ground movement.

40|$|SUPPLEMENT : RESTRICTED (not {{available}} on-line) Coal {{is being}} mined from seams which lie beneath urban {{areas around the}} City of Newcastle, New South Wales, under nearby Lake Macquarie and the Pacific Ocean. Subsidence {{occurs as a result}} of pillar extraction or longwall mining and homes and other structures or surface features can be affected. Detailed field surveys commenced in the late 19602 ̆ 7 s in the coalfields north and south of Sydney. This work was developed and extended by the author in order to provide the basic information which was used to develop a method of subsidence prediction. Because of the large quantity of results, several computer programmes were designed to handle the calculations, filing and data manipulation from the field booking sheets to the presentation of calculated results from the computer. Detailed analyses of the results of these surveys have enabled the relationship between the geometry of mine workings and the subsidence at the surface to be established for the particular geological environments. This research has shown that the massive and strong conglomerates of the Newcastle area {{have a significant effect on}} the value of the maximum subsidence. For the lower range of widths of extraction, the investigations showed that the nature of the caving of the roof strata over the mined seam influenced the magnitude of the surface subsidence. Subsidence in Newcastle was shown to be significantly less than what would be experienced in areas of mainly argillaceous strata such as in the United Kingdom because of their different caving properties and strata deformation characteristics. On the basis of a theoretical subsidence prediction method developed for the Newcastle area by the author using the survey, geological and mining information, panel and pillar mining layouts are now designed for maximum coal recovery consistent with small values of maximum subsidence. With the aid of these locally established guidelines, longwall extraction is now taking place beneath the Pacific Ocean, Lake Macquarie and areas of surface development along their shorelines. The research showed that, in the Newcastle District, subsidence develops in four stages as the ratio of the width of extraction w to the depth of cover h increases for panels of critical or supercritical length. Extraction layouts with subcritical w/h values up to 0. 55 result in a slight undulation of the surface and it is within this range that panel and pillar extraction layouts have been designed for protection of structures on the surface. Where the w/h ratio is greater than 0. 55 and less than 0. 65, a pronounced subcritical subsidence trough develops. For extraction layouts where the w/h ratio is greater than 0. 65 the maximum subsidence increases rapidly as the conglomerate within the strata fails to support itself over the increasingly wide panel. The subsidence reaches its maximum possible value at a critical w/h value of around 1. 3. In the supercritical range above 1. 3 the maximum subsidence is 0. 65 of the seam height mined. The research also revealed the factors which influenced the maximum subsidence such as the recovery of coal from the seam mined, the caving of the roof strata, whether other seams have been mined, the presence of significant faulting and the stability of pillars which remain between or adjacent to extracted panels. Other features of subsidence profiles in Newcastle studied in relation to the mine geometry were the shape of the subsidence profile, the various relationships between <b>subsidence,</b> <b>slope</b> change, curvature and strain, and the time-subsidence relationships. It was also discovered that the travelling slopes and strains above an advancing face are significantly less than the final static values over the end of the panel. Strain triangles were used to investigate the magnitudes and directions of the maximum and minimum principal strains. The principles developed as a result of the author 2 ̆ 7 s research work are unique to the Newcastle district north of Sydney where they are now used as a predictive tool in the control of mine subsidence...|$|E

Undermining is a phenomenon caused by underground mining of black coal in the active Karviná part of the Ostrava-Karviná District. It is on the boundary of the working districts Karviná – Mines I and Poruba, which are operated by the Karviná Mine. In order to assess the possible impact, isocatabase maps in different time sections were used documenting the chronology of the subsidence trough formation and next, ground deformation parameters.

Apart from the impact of undermining, the effects of climatic conditions were taken into consideration, correlating the movement size with precipitation depth in the nearest rainfall gauging stations. As for the mechanism of undermining impact there is an apparent influence of additional stress from undermining caused by elongation of the ground surface, which is evidenced by the position of the slope deformation in the convex part of the <b>subsidence</b> trough <b>slope.</b> All the above mentioned factors influence the stability conditions of the slope deformation...|$|R
40|$|Calatayud in NE Spain is an {{historically}} important city {{built on}} {{recent alluvial deposits}} underlain by gypsum and other soluble rocks. Since its foundation by the Muslims in 716 A. D., the city development has been strongly influenced by geohazards including flooding, <b>subsidence</b> and <b>slope</b> movements. Most of the flooding problems have been mitigated by diversion of the local drainage. However, dissolution of the evaporite bedrock in the urban areas continually causes subsidence and triggers rock-falls from the gypsum cliffs overlooking the city. Subsidence is also caused by the hydrocollapse of gypsiferous silt in the alluvial fan deposits. Building damage in the city was surveyed using a classification scheme developed originally to record damage in British coal mining areas. The Calatayud damage survey shows that the worst building subsidence is concentrated {{along the line of}} a buried channel that runs underneath the gypsiferous silt alluvial fan. Natural subsurface drainage causes the dissolution and subsidence, which is aggravated by leakage from water and sewage pipes. Some building damage has been exacerbated during reconstruction by incomplete piling leaving buildings partially unsupported. Mitigation measures include the control of water leakage by the installation of flexible service pipes. Careful construction techniques are needed for both conservation and new developments, especially when piled and minipiled foundations are used.

40|$|The main {{aim of the}} {{presented}} {{study was}} to create a new type of engineering-geological maps for relative costs for foundation engineering. The newly proposed map in this paper can replace the formerly used maps of the suitability for foundation engineering which shows only the suitable and/or unsuitable sites and suggests the use of suitable areas for construction only. However, there are developed technologies that they can overcome the potential problems in unsuitable areas by relatively high costs. It means that unsuitable areas can also be used as construction areas. Therefore, the use of the newly proposed map of relative costs, which reflects the complexity of geo-factors by proportional category of larger, or smaller relative costs is satisfactory. Another part of this research was to assess various geo-factors (engineering-geological zones, workability of rocks, pre-Quaternary bedrock, flood land, radon hazard, mining <b>subsidence</b> and <b>slope</b> movements), which affect the foundation of future buildings. This study was carried out in the large industrial city of Ostrava in the Czech Republic with complicated engineering geological conditions and high anthropogenic influence factors including undermining.

The Wildhorn Nappe includes an Upper Cretaceous succession bearing clear evidence for syn-sedimentary normal faulting, such as syn-sedimentary geometries related to well oriented NE-striking faults, sedimentary dykes, lateral variations in the thickness and facies of formations, anomalous and discordant contacts corresponding to palaeo-escarpments, and slump folds. Four stages of syn-sedimentary fault activity have been recognized. (1) Post-Cenomanian disruption and exhumation of the Schrattenkalk platform related to distributed normal faulting, which contributed to the initiation of karst erosion on topographic highs and sedimentation in topographic lows. (2) Turonian–Santonian marine transgression accompanied by localized normal faulting, creating growth-fault structures, differential <b>subsidence</b> and <b>slope</b> instability. A transition from distributed to more localized faulting is observed, related to a final stage {{in the evolution of the}} Cretaceous extensional process. (3) Early Maastrichtian faulting. The facies and thickness of subsequent sediments reflect a passive adaption to the pre-existing topography of the sea floor, established during the earlier tectonic movements. (4) Post-Maastrichtian north-directed tilt and erosion. In the Wildhorn Nappe, palaeo-fault activity most probably ended in the Early Maastrichtian rather than continuing into the Eocene. Until now, the regional importance and magnitude of Late Cretaceous extension has not been recognized in the Helvetic domain.

A quantification of the post-rift (20 Ma- 0 Ma) vertical movements of the Gulf of Lion (West Mediterranean) is proposed here based on the stratigraphic study of sedimentary paleomarkers using a large 3 D grid of reflection seismic data, correlations with existing drillings, and refraction data. Post-rift subsidence {{was measured by the}} direct use of sedimentary geometries analysed in 3 D and validated by numerical stratigraphic modelling.

At a constant distance from the rotational hinge line, the Plio-Quaternary subsidence rate is constant on the shelf overall. Conversely, Miocene subsidence rates are very different on the eastern and western shelves. Stratigraphic simulations focused on the Messinian salinity crisis (MSC) were also performed.

Further, karst terranes cover 20 % of the Earth’s surface and provides 20 - 25 % of high-quality groundwater for drinking water. The fragility of karst environments makes it highly vulnerable {{to a variety of}} different geological hazards (or geo-hazards). This is due to its peculiar geological and hydrological features such as sinkholes and caves. In particular, the strict connection between surface and subsurface features emphasizes the fragile nature of karst.

Natural and man-induced <b>subsidence</b> and sinkholes, <b>slope</b> movements favored by karst conduits and caves, flash floods related to inability of the system to manage water from heavy rainstorms, and pollution caused directly or indirectly by human actions are the main types of geo-hazards typical of karst terranes.

Models of {{magnetic}} and gravity anomalies along two E-W transects offshore central Oregon, {{one of which}} is coincident with a detailed velocity model, provide quantitative limits on the structure of the subducting oceanic crust and the crystalline backstop. The models indicate that the backstop-forming western edge of the Siletz terrane, an oceanic plateau that was accreted to North America ~ 50 million years ago, has a seaward dip of less than 60 ° 3. Seismic, magnetic, and gravity data are compatible with no more than 2 km of subducted sediments between the Siletz terrane and the underlying crystalline crust of the Juan de Fuca plate. The data also suggest the presence of a N-S trending, 200 -km-long basaltic ridge buried beneath the accretionary complex from about 43 °N to 45 °N. Although the height and width of this ridge probably vary along strike, it may be up to 4 km high and several kilometers wide in places and appears to be locally in contact with the Siletz terrane beneath Heceta Bank. Several models for the origin of this ridge are discussed. These include: a sliver of Siletz terrane detached from the main Siletz terrane during a late Eocene episode of strike-slip faulting; imbrications and thickening of subducted oceanic crust in place; an aseismic ridge rafted in on the subducting oceanic crust during the past 1. 2 million years; and a series of ridges and/or seamounts rafted in {{over a longer period of}} time and transferred from the subducting plate to the overlying plate. The last model is the most consistent with the complicated history of local uplift, <b>subsidence,</b> and <b>slope</b> instability recorded in the ridges, basins, and banks of this part of the margin. We speculate that the massive seaward dipping western edge of the Siletz terrane in this region inhibits subduction of seamounts and sediments, resulting in formation of buried ridge as the accumulated flotsam and jetsom of subduction. This process may also be responsible for thickening of lower accretionary complex material, over-steepening of slopes leading to massive slumping, and north-south extension through strike-slip faulting in the accretionary complex to the west of the buried ridge. Regardless of its origin, the ridge may currently be acting as an asperity inhibiting subduction...|$|R

The round in plan and circular annular reinforced concrete foundations are mainly used in engineering structures, such as chimneys, silos, water towers, tanks. Buildings and structures built on the unfavorable areas are exposed with deformation influence from the foundation. The degree of weakening of the foundation depends {{on the size of}} the horizontal deformations and change of the structure and state of the soil. Purpose. Reduced the characteristics of weak bases are defined differently, depending on the nature, type and size of deformation. Not for all cases, there are specific recommendations as for their definition. The work of round, circular, polygonal shape of the foundation plates is not studied enough in these conditions and requires consideration. Conclusion. One of the actual problems of the foundation structures design is to define the limits of deformation effects for a certain type of foundation for a given force loading in hard soil conditions. This task can be solved with a gradual increase of deformation impacts on foundation (increasing of curvature, <b>slope,</b> <b>subsidence,</b> dimensions of the ledge, the diameter of the failures).

Its head scarp (> 35 m high) was dated by Le Roux et al. (2009) using the cosmic ray exposure (CRE) method. Even though these previous results revealed that the initiation of the instability occurred several thousand years after ice down-wastage in the valley, the internal landslide evolution is not constrained. In this paper, we provide 63 additional Be- 10 samples collected from the internal scarps and the main scarp, as well as on glacially polished rock surfaces. The aim is to constrain the global landslide kinematics (internal and head scarps) and its relationship with glacier retreat. Results from glacially polished surfaces point out that complex shielding processes (relict moraines, soil deposits and seasonal snow cover) might have affected rock dating. Despite scattering of the resulting ages, the dataset shows that the glacial retreat was achieved between 17. 5 and 13 ka. Exposure ages obtained on gravitational scarps reveal that the landslide initiation occurred 8 to 6 ka ago. From the initiation until 2 ka the gravitational kinematics was slow (similar to 2 mm" year(- 1)) and focused around the head scarp, leading to a general <b>slope</b> <b>subsidence.</b> After 2 ka, the exposure rates increased significantly (similar to 8 min. year(- 1)) with the development of pervasive internal deformation of the landslide mass.

30|$|Currently, {{subsided}} areas after mining {{are generally}} reclaimed {{upon completion of}} mining over a large region {{to take advantage of}} the economies of scale and mining sequence for different longwall panels. This is termed here as traditional reclamation or TR or “end of pipe solution” where land grading, soil placement, and agricultural production are performed mostly after the land has stabilized (Hu et al. 2013; Hu and Xiao 2013 b) after mining. TR approaches may satisfy only the first reclamation goal identified above, but they would most likely not satisfy the second goal. TR approaches may not develop efficient development and utilization of the coal, farmland and water resources, and regional economic development. Over the last 10 – 15  years, researchers at CUMTB are developing alternate CMR approaches to reclaim subsided land as mining progresses. They are similar to concurrent mining and reclamation concepts used in surface mining but are more complex. Examples include research by Li et al. (1999) who designed a pre-reclamation plan for Liuqiao coal mine based on land damage analysis. They concluded that the best time for pre-reclamation is after skipping mining of the No. 6 coal seam and before mining the central isolated working face. Furthermore, the layout of the pre-constructed water pond must correspond with the underground mining layout. Zhao and Hu (2008) developed an “appropriate reclamation timing model” for subsiding land that incorporates planning for reclamation. Hu et al. (2013) proposed CMR concepts for longwall mining to reclaim high value land resources (Hu and Chen 2016), which were successfully demonstrated in the field in Anhui Province, China. In laying out mining plans, subsidence development during various stages were analyzed and pertinent factors such as vertical <b>subsidence,</b> post-mining <b>slope,</b> water area, and land use condition were considered in reclamation planning. Hu et al. (2016 b) discussed a CMR design case study that considered the value of both land and water resources. Limited CMR research to date has focused primarily on reclamation goal 1 above and there is room for additional development even there to better protect farmland and water resources. Over the last 5  years, the Institute of Land Reclamation and Ecological Restoration at the CUMTB and Southern Illinois University Carbondale (SIUC in USA) researchers are working collaboratively. They have sought to minimize the impacts to farmland and water resources and in some cases, enhance utilization of all resources while simultaneously minimizing negative economic impacts. The goals of these development efforts are to minimize loss of and/or to enhance: (1) farmland use for agriculture during and after the entire mining process, (2) surface and ground water resources for agriculture, and economic development; and (3) revenue from utilization of all resources.|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Subsidence {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{challenging}} and controversial problems in rock mechanics and geotechnical engineering. In particular, the expansion of urbanised areas over abandoned mining excavations has brought about several questions concerning the long term stability of such excavations and the duration of the subsidence development. This study, therefore, aims to investigate the mechanisms of post mining subsidence. The role of the effective factors on the mechanisms of excavation induced ground movements are assessed through some case studies of actual subsidence incidents. Clearly, one of the fundamental stages of conducting numerical or theoretical analyses for calculating the magnitudes of subsidence is to reliably estimate the mechanical parameters of rock masses. A simple and practical approach is developed in this study, based on the concept of rock mass classification methods to approximate the rock mass parameters. Additionally, the mechanisms of mining induced <b>subsidence</b> in <b>sloping</b> terrain are investigated through numerical modelling. An interesting example of mining beneath escarpments in New South Wales, Australia, is investigated to capture the effects of the surface topography on the mechanisms of subsidence. Furthermore, the role of the gradual deterioration of a rock mass on the duration of the subsidence development in shallow abandoned coal mines is investigated. The conventional Tributary Area Method (TAM) is augmented to incorporate the effects of the gradual deterioration on the loads of pillars. Moreover, the conventional pillar strength methods are modified to take into account the effects of the gradual deterioration. The combination of these two approaches provides a suitable ground for assessing the life times of pillars. Furthermore, a simple and practical approach is proposed to take into account the role of gradual deterioration in the numerical modelling. The proposed approach is then employed for assessing the formation of subsidence over an abandoned shallow coal mine around the village of Dolphingstone, UK. The outcomes of the numerical modelling are then verified against the results of the empirical methods for estimating the stand up time of room and pillar mining excavations. Creep is the other time dependent behaviour of rocks, controlling the long term stability of excavations. The role of this factor on the mechanisms of post mining subsidence is also investigated in this study. The theories of visco elasticity and visco plasticity are employed in the frameworks of the analytical and numerical modelling to study the effects of creep on the gradual development of subsidence over abandoned room and pillar mines. The outcomes of the study show that creep plays a pronounced role on the values of the time dependent displacements over mining excavations. Moreover, a procedure is developed to take into account the effects of gradual weakening due to mechanical factors (e. g., creep) or environmental factors (e. g., weathering and moisture softening) on the formation of sinkholes. The proposed approaches are then employed for investigating the mechanisms of the subsidence over an abandoned limestone mine in the West Midlands, UK...|$|R
40|$|International audienceStudying long term-evolution of {{gravitational}} slope evolution {{is a key}} to understanding deep-seated landslide processes. This paper deals with three large Deep-Seated Landslides (DSLs) at a front of a subalpine meridional chain, on the "La Marbrière" slope near the town of Grasse (Alpes-Maritimes, France). The geological framework controlling the stability and morphology of the DSLs is associated with thick and tamped Triassic layers of mudstone with gypsum overlain by highly faulted Jurassic limestone. Gravitational deformation affects the entire slope, involving a movement of about 1. 1 × 108 m 3 of rock material. It creates large disturbances in landscape morphology, such as scarps, counter-slope scarps, trenches and other typical gravitational morpho-structures. Geomorphological mapping coupled with deep electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) reveals a strong correlation between these morpho-structures and inherited brittle tectonic features. This observation relies on spatial and geometrical relations (on the surface and at the depth of more than 150 m, checked by ERT) between the most persistent fault and the gravitational morpho-structures. The specific distribution of the morpho-structures {{on the basis of their}} morphological typologies and variations in the stage of evolution of three DSLs provides an interpretation of their kinematics during the last 400 ka. It appears that soft substratums combined with inherited persistent anisotropies are key factors in the development of the DSLs. Indeed, outflow of mudstone due to the lithostatic pressure imposed by individual limestone compartments has led to general <b>slope</b> <b>subsidence.</b> Then, a progressive toppling of a rock mass may have led to the catastrophic rock collapse along bedding planes. The evolution of the DSLs can be divided into three distinct stages represented by three zones: a young collapse stage (zone 1), a pre-collapse stage (zone 2) and an old mature stage (> 400 ka, zone 3). As the DSLs occur on the same slope and in the same geological context, this area offers interesting perspectives for understanding factors controlling the long-term gravitational evolution of slopes...|$|R
40|$|We use seismic {{reflection}} and refraction data to determine crustal structure, to map a fore-arc basin containing 12 km of sediment, and to image the subduction thrust at 35 km depth. Seismic reflection megasequences within the basin are correlated with onshore geology: megasequence X, Late Cretaceous and Paleogene marine passive margin sediments; megasequence Y, a similar to 10, 000 km(3) submarine landslide emplaced during subduction initiation at 22 Ma; and megasequence Z, a Neogene subduction margin megasequence. The Moho lies at 17 km beneath the basin center and at 35 km {{at the southern}} margin. Beneath the western basin margin, we interpret reflective units as deformed Gondwana fore-arc sediment that was thrust in Cretaceous time over oceanic crust 7 km thick. Raukumara Basin has normal faults at its western margin and is uplifted along its eastern and southern margins. Raukumara Basin represents a rigid fore-arc block > 150 km long, which contrasts with widespread faulting and large Neogene vertical axis rotations farther south. Taper of {{the western edge of}} allochthonous unit Y and westward thickening and downlap of immediately overlying strata suggest westward or northwestward paleoslope and emplacement direction rather than southwestward, as proposed for the correlative onshore allochthon. Spatial correlation between rock uplift of the eastern and southern basin margins with the intersection between Moho and subduction thrust leads us to suggest that crustal underplating is modulated by fore-arc crustal thickness. The trench slope has many small extensional faults and lacks coherent internal reflections, suggesting collapse of indurated rock, rather than accretion of > 1 km of sediment from the downgoing plate. The lack of volcanic intrusion east of the active arc, and stratigraphic evidence for the broadening of East Cape Ridge with time, suggests net fore-arc accretion since 22 Ma. We propose a cyclical fore-arc kinematic: rock moves down a subduction channel to near the base of the crust, where underplating drives rock uplift, oversteepens the trench slope, and causes collapse toward the trench and subduction channel. Cyclical rock particle paths led to persistent trench <b>slope</b> <b>subsidence</b> during net accretion. Existing global estimates of fore-arc loss are systematically too high because they assume vertical particle paths. Citation: Sutherland, R., et al.

40|$|Though an {{outstanding}} achievement for their time, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) topographic {{maps of the}} eastern Alaskan Arctic nonetheless contain significant errors, and {{in this paper we}} address one of them. Specifically, USGS maps of different scale made in the late  1950 s alternate between Mt.  Chamberlin and Mt.  Isto as the tallest peak in the US Arctic. Given that many of the peaks here are close in height and covered with glaciers, recent climate change may also have changed their height and their order. We resolved these questions using fodar, a new airborne photogrammetric technique that utilizes structure-from-motion (SfM) software and requires no ground control, and validated it using GPS measurements on the peaks as well as airborne lidar. Here we show that Mt.  Chamberlin is currently the third tallest peak and that the order and elevations of the five tallest mountains in the US Arctic are Mt.  Isto (2735. 6  m), Mt.  Hubley (2717. 6  m), Mt.  Chamberlin (2712. 3  m), Mt.  Michelson (2698. 1  m), and an unnamed peak (2694. 9  m); these heights are relative to the NAVD 88 GEOID 12 A vertical datum. We find that it is indeed plausible that this ranking has changed over time and may continue to change as summit glaciers continue to shrink, though Mt.  Isto will remain the highest under current climate trends. Mt.  Isto is also over 100  m taller than the highest peak in Arctic Canada, making it the highest peak in the North American Arctic. Fodar elevations compared to within a few centimeters of our ground-based GPS measurements of the peaks made a few days later and our complete validation assessment indicates a measurement uncertainty of better than ± 20  cm (95  % RMSE). By analyzing time series of fodar maps, we were able to detect topographic change on the centimeter level on these steep slopes, indicating that fodar can be used to measure mountain snow packs for water resource availability or avalanche danger, glacier volume change, and <b>slope</b> <b>subsidence,</b> as well as many other applications of benefit to society. Compared to lidar, the current state-of-the-art airborne topographic mapping, we found this SfM technique as accurate, more useful scientifically, and significantly less expensive, suggesting that fodar is a disruptive innovation that will enjoy widespread usage in the future...|$|R
