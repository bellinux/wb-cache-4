5|$|In {{the case}} of the weak interaction, fermions can {{exchange}} three distinct types of force carriers known as the W+, W−, and Z bosons. The mass of each of these bosons is far greater than the mass of a proton or neutron, which is consistent with the short range of the weak force. The force is in fact termed weak because its field strength over a given distance is typically several orders of magnitude less than that of the <b>strong</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> or electromagnetic force.|$|E
5|$|The weak {{interaction}} affects all the fermions of the Standard Model, {{as well as}} the Higgs boson; neutrinos interact through gravity and the {{weak interaction}} only, and neutrinos were the original reason for the name weak force. The weak interaction does not produce bound states (nor does it involve binding energy) – something that gravity does on an astronomical scale, that the electromagnetic force does at the atomic level, and that the <b>strong</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> does inside nuclei.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the AdS/CFT correspondence in late 1997 {{was the culmination of}} a long history of efforts to relate string theory to nuclear physics. In fact, string theory was originally developed during the late 1960s and early 1970s as a theory of hadrons, the subatomic particles like the proton and neutron that are held together by the <b>strong</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force.</b> The idea was that each of these particles could be viewed as a different oscillation mode of a string. In the late 1960s, experimentalists had found that hadrons fall into families called Regge trajectories with squared energy proportional to angular momentum, and theorists showed that this relationship emerges naturally from the physics of a rotating relativistic string.|$|E

5000|$|Neutrons are {{scattered}} by the atomic nuclei through the <b>strong</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces,</b> but in addition, the magnetic moment of neutrons is non-zero. They are therefore also scattered by magnetic fields. When neutrons {{are scattered}} from hydrogen-containing materials, they produce diffraction patterns with high noise levels. However, the material {{can sometimes be}} treated to substitute deuterium for hydrogen.|$|R
5|$|Of {{the four}} {{fundamental}} interactions, gravitation is dominant at cosmological length scales, including galaxies and larger-scale structures. Gravity's effects are cumulative; by contrast, {{the effects of}} positive and negative charges tend to cancel one another, making electromagnetism relatively insignificant on cosmological length scales. The remaining two interactions, the weak and <b>strong</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces,</b> decline very rapidly with distance; their effects are confined mainly to sub-atomic length scales.|$|R
5|$|The Standard Model of {{particle}} physics {{is a theory}} which describes {{three of the four}} known fundamental interactions between the elementary particles that make up all matter. This theory allows predictions to be made about how particles will interact under many conditions. The energy per particle in a supernova is typically one to one hundred and fifty picojoules (tens to hundreds of MeV). The per-particle energy involved in a supernova is small enough that the predictions gained from the Standard Model {{of particle}} physics are likely to be basically correct. But the high densities may require corrections to the Standard Model. In particular, Earth-based particle accelerators can produce particle interactions which are of much higher energy than are found in supernovae, but these experiments involve individual particles interacting with individual particles, and {{it is likely that the}} high densities within the supernova will produce novel effects. The interactions between neutrinos and the other particles in the supernova take place with the weak nuclear force, which is believed to be well understood. However, the interactions between the protons and neutrons involve the <b>strong</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force,</b> which is much less well understood.|$|E
25|$|Quantum field {{theories}} for the <b>strong</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> and {{the weak}} nuclear force have also been developed. The quantum field theory of the <b>strong</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> is called quantum chromodynamics, and describes the interactions of subnuclear particles such as quarks and gluons. The {{weak nuclear force}} and the electromagnetic force were unified, in their quantized forms, into a single quantum field theory (known as electroweak theory), by the physicists Abdus Salam, Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg. These three men shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979 for this work.|$|E
25|$|Baryons are {{strongly}} interacting fermions, that is, they are acted {{on by the}} <b>strong</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> and are described by Fermi−Dirac statistics, which apply to all particles obeying the Pauli exclusion principle.

40|$|Particle physicist's {{ultimate}} goal is 'grand unification' - describing the four forces observed today - electromagnetism, weak and <b>strong</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> and gravity with just a single law, expressable as a few concise equations. But some solid state physicists are now contesting the validity of this approach, arguing that many forms of matter cannot be described solely in terms of fundamental particle interactions - when systems are very complex, new and independent laws emerge.

25|$|This process, {{mediated}} by the <b>strong</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> rather than the weak force, is extremely fast by comparison to the first step. It is estimated that, under the conditions in the Sun's core, each newly created deuterium nucleus exists for only about four seconds before it is converted to He-3.|$|E
25|$|It {{is already}} known that {{electromagnetism}} and the {{weak nuclear force}} are different manifestations of a single force called the electroweak force.

25|$|This {{first step}} is {{extremely}} slow because the positron emission of the diproton to deuterium is extremely rare (the {{vast majority of the}} time, the diproton decays back into hydrogen-1 through proton emission). This is because the emission of the positron is brought about by the weak nuclear force, which is immensely weaker than the <b>strong</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> and the electromagnetic force.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{other types}} of {{radiation}} used in diffraction studies of materials, such as X-rays and neutrons, electrons are charged particles and interact with matter through the Coulomb forces. This means that the incident electrons feel the influence of both the positively charged atomic nuclei and the surrounding electrons. In comparison, X-rays interact with the spatial distribution of the valence electrons, while neutrons are scattered by the atomic nuclei through the <b>strong</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces.</b> In addition, the magnetic moment of neutrons is non-zero, and they are therefore also scattered by magnetic fields. Because of these different forms of interaction, {{the three types of}} radiation are suitable for different studies.|$|R
40|$|In {{the cluster}} {{expansion}} framework of Bose liquids we calculate analytical {{expressions of the}} two-body, three-body and four-body diagrams contributing to the g. s. energy of an infinite system of neutral alpha-particles at zero-temperature, interacting via the <b>strong</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> exclusively. This is analytically tractable by assuming a density dependent two-body correlation function of Gaussian type. For the alpha-alpha potential we adopt the phenomenological Ali-Bodmer interaction and semi-microscopic potentials obtained from the Gogny force parametrizations. We show that under such assumptions we achieve a rapid convergence in the cluster expansion, the four-body contributions to the energy being smaller than the two-body and three-body contributions by at least an order of magnitude.

25|$|All atomic nuclei, being {{composed}} of protons and neutrons, repel one another {{because of their}} positive charge. However, if the atoms have a high enough temperature and pressure (for example, {{in the core of}} the Sun), then their random motions can overcome such electrical repulsion (called the Coulomb force), and they can come close enough for the <b>strong</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> to take effect, fusing them into heavier atoms.|$|E
25|$|The tritium nucleus, {{containing}} one proton and two neutrons, has {{the same}} charge as the nucleus of ordinary hydrogen, and it experiences the same electrostatic repulsive force when brought close to another atomic nucleus. However, the neutrons in the tritium nucleus increase the attractive <b>strong</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> when brought close enough to another atomic nucleus. As a result, tritium can more easily fuse with other light atoms, compared with the ability of ordinary hydrogen to do so.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} is similar if two nuclei are brought together. As they approach each other, all the protons in one nucleus repel all the protons in the other. Not until the two nuclei actually come {{close enough for}} long enough so the <b>strong</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> can take over (by way of tunneling) is the repulsive electrostatic force overcome. Consequently, even when the final energy state is lower, {{there is a large}} energy barrier that must first be overcome. It is called the Coulomb barrier.|$|E
2500|$|The {{net result}} of the {{opposing}} electrostatic and <b>strong</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> is that the binding energy per nucleon generally increases with increasing size, up to the elements iron and nickel, and then decreases for heavier nuclei.

25|$|For the {{propulsion}} of the studied vehicles, Bob Lazar {{claims that}} the atomic Element 115 served as a nuclear fuel. Element 115 (provisionally named 'Ununpentium' (Uup)) reportedly provided an energy source which would produce anti-gravity effects under proton bombardment along with the production of antimatter used for energy production. Lazar's website says that, if the intense <b>strong</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> field of element 115's nucleus was properly amplified, the resulting effect would be a distortion of the surrounding gravitational field, allowing the vehicle to immediately shorten the distance to a charted destination.|$|E
25|$|Activation {{energies}} for fusion {{reactions are}} generally high because the protons in each nucleus {{will tend to}} strongly repel one another, as they each have the same positive charge. A heuristic for estimating reaction rates is that nuclei {{must be able to}} get within 100 femtometers (1 × 10−13 meter) of each other, where the nuclei are increasingly likely to undergo quantum tunneling past the electrostatic barrier and the turning point where the <b>strong</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force</b> and the electrostatic force are equally balanced, allowing them to fuse. In ITER, this distance of approach is made possible by high temperatures and magnetic confinement.|$|E

Psychokinesis would have to be either some form of one of these four forces, or a new force that has a billionth the strength of gravity, for otherwise it would have been captured in experiments already done.

We investigate the influence of <b>strong</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> and the isotope effects in H̅ H and H̅ D collisions and demonstrate enhancement of these effects due {{to the presence of}} the near-threshold narrow HH̅ (H̅ D) states.

40|$|Abstract. This {{article is}} an attempt to expose the role played by {{messenger}} particles in physics. The concept of the ”messenger particle ” has long been considered in physics. The latest research shows evidence that the four fundamental forces of nature,Gravitation, Electromagnetic and the Weak and <b>Strong</b> <b>Nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> are all created by messenger particles. This hypotheses is leading to a new way of thinking about the fundamental sub-atomic wave/particles that are the building blocks of our universe. Some of the latest evidence actually shows that in order to understand what is happening with these messenger particles it is necessary to perceive them as information carriers. The four messenger particles that are thought to exist are the Graviton (not yet discovered), Photon, Weak Guage Boson and the Gluon. This pape...|$|R
40|$|Geophysical {{measurements}} of the gravitational constant and a recent reexamination of experiments performed early in the century on the equivalence of inertial and gravitational mass may have provided either observational clues to the unification of gravity with electroweak and <b>strong</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces</b> or an indication of a new, previously unrecognized force. The evidence is still less than completely conclusive but it has now become difficult to find explanations of the geophysical observations other than non-Newtonian gravity. We also point {{to the requirements of}} the next generation of experiments. These include {{measurements of}} gravity or gravity gradient in the deep ocean and high above it and Von Eötvös-type experiments in steep terrain to test the possibility that a postulated short-range (100 to 1000 m) component of gravity depends upon fundamental particle count rather than mass...|$|R
25|$|Epsilon (ε), {{a measure}} of the nuclear {{efficiency}} of fusion from hydrogen to helium, is 0.007: when four nucleons fuse into helium, 0.007 (0.7%) of their mass is converted to energy. The value of ε is in part determined by the strength of the <b>strong</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force.</b> If ε were 0.006, only hydrogen could exist, and complex chemistry would be impossible. According to Rees, if it were above 0.008, no hydrogen would exist, as all the hydrogen would have been fused shortly after the big bang. Other physicists disagree, calculating that substantial hydrogen remains as long as the strong force coupling constant increases by less than about 50%.|$|E
25|$|The next part in Guth's path {{came when}} he heard a lecture by Steven Weinberg in early 1979. Weinberg talked in two lectures about the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) that had been {{developed}} since 1974, and how it could explain the huge amount of matter in the universe compared to the amount of antimatter. The GUT explained all the fundamental forces known in science except for gravity. It established that in very hot conditions, such as those after the Big Bang, electromagnetism, the <b>strong</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force,</b> and the weak nuclear force were united to form one force. Weinberg also was the one who emphasized the idea that the universe goes through phase transitions, similar to the phases of matter, when going from high energy to low energy. Weinberg’s discussion of why matter is so dominant over anti-matter showed Guth how precise calculations about particles could be obtained by studying the first few seconds of the universe.|$|E
25|$|String {{theory was}} first {{studied in the}} late 1960s as a theory of the <b>strong</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>force,</b> before being {{abandoned}} in favor of quantum chromodynamics. Subsequently, it was realized that the very properties that made string theory unsuitable as a theory of nuclear physics made it a promising candidate for a quantum theory of gravity. The earliest version of string theory, bosonic string theory, incorporated only the class of particles known as bosons. It later developed into superstring theory, which posits a connection called supersymmetry between bosons and the class of particles called fermions. Five consistent versions of superstring theory were developed before it was conjectured in the mid-1990s {{that they were all}} different limiting cases of a single theory in eleven dimensions known as M-theory. In late 1997, theorists discovered an important relationship called the AdS/CFT correspondence, which relates string theory to another type of physical theory called a quantum field theory.|$|E
25|$|Nuclei {{are bound}} {{together}} by the residual <b>strong</b> <b>force</b> (<b>nuclear</b> <b>force).</b> The residual <b>strong</b> force is a minor residuum of the strong interaction which binds quarks together to form protons and neutrons.

50|$|The {{research}} of Henneaux {{is devoted to}} the study of the theoretical models describing the fundamental physical interactions (electromagnetism, weak and <b>strong</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>forces,</b> gravity), with a particular emphasis on their symmetries. With J.David Brown, he showed that Einstein theory of gravity in three spacetime dimensions with a negative cosmological constant possesses a remarkable symmetry structure at infinity described by two Virasoro algebras. The corresponding central charge bears the name of « Brown-Henneaux central charge ». This work is sometimes regarded as one of the precursors of the celebrated AdS/CFT correspondence. Henneaux also studied the geometrical and algebraic aspects of theories with a gauge freedom, and in particular on the so-called Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin symmetry and its cohomology. More recently, in collaboration with Thibault Damour, he showed that hyperbolic Coxeter groups appear somewhat unexpectedly in gravitational theories and their supersymmetric extensions, in the BKL behaviour of the fields near a spacelike singularity.|$|R
