5|$|Riders pay {{a single}} fare {{to enter the}} subway system and may {{transfer}} between trains {{at no extra cost}} until they exit via station turnstiles; the fare is a flat rate regardless of how far or how long the rider travels. Thus, riders must <b>swipe</b> their MetroCard upon entering the subway system, but not a second time upon leaving.|$|E
5|$|In {{the primary}} portion of Infinity Blade, the player {{character}} travels a largely linear path through a ruined castle and fights one-on-one battles with oversized enemies. The {{path through the}} castle {{is a series of}} discreet locations where the player can pan the camera around the stationary player character to view a fully three-dimensional area. The player taps locations highlighted onscreen to trigger either a short cutscene as the player character moves to the next location, or a sword battle with an enemy. During combat, the player controls the character's sword by swiping a finger across the screen. Players can touch icons {{at the bottom of the}} screen to dodge attacks by ducking right or left, or to block attacks with a shield, which has a limited number of uses during a single battle. Players may also parry incoming attacks with an intercepting sword move that, for example, parries an attack from the left with a <b>swipe</b> to the left. Each of these three counters can leave the enemy vulnerable to counterattack for a short period, but incorrect counters result in damage to the player character, as reflected in the health bar. When players fail in battle en route to the God King, the game resets to the location preceding the previous battle. Enemies can perform attacks that cannot be parried or blocked—such as a shield bash—that must be dodged. Players use two special abilities via icons atop the screen: the Super Attack temporarily stuns the opponent, and magic heals or attacks as indicated by drawing a given symbol. Both require time to recharge after use. When attacking, the player can <b>swipe</b> in any direction, and can do specific attack combinations to deal extra damage.|$|E
5|$|Infinity Blade is a {{fighting}} game with role-playing elements developed by Chair Entertainment and Epic Games and released through the Apple App Store on December 9, 2010. It {{is the first}} iOS video game to run on the Unreal Engine. In the game, the unnamed player character fights a series of one-on-one battles in a derelict castle to face the immortal God King. When in battle, players <b>swipe</b> the screen to attack and parry, and tap the screen to dodge and block enemy attacks. Upon victory or defeat, the player restarts the game as the character's descendant with the same items and experience level.|$|E
5000|$|Cartoonists {{have also}} <b>swiped</b> images from mass media and {{commercial}} art. Examples include Batman creator Bob Kane repeatedly <b>swiping</b> from early 20th-century illustrator Henry Vallely, Greg Land repeatedly <b>swiping</b> pornography {{as well as}} many popular comic book artists, 2000 AD artist Mick Austin <b>swiping</b> an image of Toni Shilleto's from Mayfair: Entertainment for Men, Jon J. Muth <b>swiping</b> a 1940s photograph, and David Chelsea <b>swiping</b> from Spanish pornography. Sometimes the <b>swiping</b> happens [...] "in reverse," [...] as in the example of an illustration from Organic Gardening magazine <b>swiping</b> the iconic Kirby cover for Fantastic Four #1.|$|R
5000|$|There {{is a long}} {{tradition}} in comics of using fine art as [...] "inspiration" [...] as well. Most observers do not consider this as objectionable as <b>swiping</b> from another cartoonist's work. Examples include Art Spiegelman <b>swiping</b> {{an image of the}} Russian artist M. Mazruho's in Maus, Eddie Campbell <b>swiping</b> Diego Velázquez, and Jill Thompson <b>swiping</b> the work of Arthur Rackham.|$|R
40|$|There are differing {{theories}} {{concerning the}} construction dubbed <b>swiping</b> by Merchant 2002. Some theories {{predict that the}} inverted preposition/wh-word order characteristic of <b>swiping</b> is idiosyncratic to prepositions and wh-words in particular and does not generalize to other elements. Other theories predict that <b>swiping</b> is merely a particular instantiation of a generalizable possibility for inverted word orders under ellipsis. In this paper I provide evidence for this latter type of theory by showing that the characteristics of <b>swiping</b> extend beyond prepositionals and wh-words. The generalization is that whatever can extrapose and be extracted from can enter into a <b>swiping</b> like construction...|$|R
5|$|Croc's {{maneuvering}} {{abilities are}} somewhat {{comparable to that}} of Mario's in Super Mario 64, with his primary methods of movement consisting of the abilities to run, jump, climb, and swim using either the analog stick or the D-pad, as well as touting the abilities to perform a sidestep and a 180-degree quick turn as other methods of maneuver. Croc's main method of attack consists of a full-circle tail <b>swipe</b> that is used to defeat enemies and bosses, as well as a hit drop move {{that can be used to}} break open crates containing collectibles. Croc's in-game health is represented by the crystals that the player collects throughout the game; when Croc is hurt by an enemy, all of his crystals are lost and scattered around him in several directions (similar to a mechanic commonly used in Sonic the Hedgehog). If Croc is hurt while he has no crystals, the player loses a life and is sent back to the beginning of the segment of the level they are currently in.|$|E
5|$|Section D {{believes}} banker Alexis Meynell {{is trying}} to bankrupt the country. Sir Harry Pearce (Peter Firth) asks the Chancellor of the Exchequer Gillian Calderwood (Selina Cadell) to freeze Meynell's assets, but is turned down {{due to lack of}} evidence. To get the evidence they need, Ros is sent undercover to the London Stock Exchange, where Meynell is targeting the bank Highland Life. After starting a rumour about the bank, he starts betting against it. When the chairman of Highland Life, Francis Debham (Simon Williams), attempts to keep the bank afloat, Meynell doubles his position, bankrupting Highland Life. Ros uses the opportunity to <b>swipe</b> a memory card from Meynell's mobile phone, containing his secure email account that could prove his guilt. However, they find nothing relevant. Lucas North (Richard Armitage) relays this to Ros and tells her to get closer to Meynell.|$|E
5|$|The third {{video game}} {{based on the}} film was titled Beauty & The Beast: Roar of the Beast and is a side-scrolling video game for the Genesis. As the Beast, the player must {{successfully}} complete several levels, based on scenes from the film, {{in order to protect}} the castle from invading villagers and forest animals and rescue Belle from Gaston. The fourth video game based on the film was titled Disney's Beauty and the Beast and is an action platformer for the SNES. It was developed by Probe Entertainment and published by Hudson Soft in North America in July 1994 and in Europe on February 23, 1995. The game was published by Virgin Interactive in Japan on July 8, 1994. The entire game is played through the perspective of the Beast. As the Beast, the player must get Belle to fall in love so that the curse cast upon him and his castle will be broken. The final boss of the game is Gaston. The Beast can walk, jump, <b>swipe,</b> stomp, super stomp, and roar, the last of which is used to both damage enemies and reveal hidden objects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Swiping</b> in {{particular}} patterns unleashes a combo, {{which is a}} powered-up sword hit. When using a light weapon, <b>swiping</b> left, right, left, or the opposite, unleashes a huge hit; left, left, right, right (or the opposite, right, right, left, left) performs a Mega Hit; left, right, up down, left performs an Ultra Hit, the highest combo. Combos with heavy weapons are performed by <b>swiping</b> twice in the same direction, then <b>swiping</b> a third time following {{the direction of the}} onscreen instruction. Combos with light weapons are performed by <b>swiping</b> left, right, and then left again (or the opposite pattern) more slowly and continuing the pattern.|$|R
50|$|When {{running in}} tablet mode, the start menu {{and all the}} apps run in full screen. All running apps are hidden from the taskbar and a back button appears. <b>Swiping</b> from the top closes the app while <b>swiping</b> from the left evokes the Task View and <b>swiping</b> from the right evokes the Action Center.|$|R

50|$|Connors meets a {{homeless}} girl named Lucy Calhoun (Fay Wray) and takes {{her to his}} apartment, where he lives with <b>Swipes,</b> and lets her spend the night. In the morning, he is pleasantly surprised (and <b>Swipes</b> annoyed), to find that Lucy has cleaned up the place and cooked breakfast. <b>Swipes</b> later locks Lucy in a closet and, when Connors finds her, spanks him. Humiliated, <b>Swipes</b> packs and leaves. That night, Brodie invites <b>Swipes</b> {{to move in with}} him, which he does. Finding out about Lucy, Brodie attempts to seduce her, thinking that she is Connors' mistress. She bites his hand, drawing blood, and after learning her identity, he apologizes and asks if he can call on her. They soon fall in love, and Brodie reveals his ambition to run a saloon bigger than Connors'.|$|R
50|$|Gameplay {{is similar}} to {{traditional}} endless runners a la Temple Run. To move the player left or right to collect batteries or avoid objects, the player moves their finger slightly in the desired direction on the touchscreen. To make a sharp turn {{to the left or}} right, the player <b>swipes</b> across the screen in the corresponding direction. To jump, the player <b>swipes</b> upwards; to slide, the player <b>swipes</b> downwards.|$|R

5000|$|Artists Jack Kirby, Neal Adams, Hergé, and Jim Lee {{are common}} targets of <b>swipes,</b> though even those artists {{may not be}} above reproach; Kirby was known to have <b>swiped</b> from Hal Foster early in his career. Similarly, many Golden Age artists kept [...] "swipe files" [...] of {{material}} to be copied as needed. Certain contemporary artists have become notorious for their <b>swiping,</b> including Rich Buckler (who favors Neal Adams and Jack Kirby), Rob Liefeld (many artists), Keith Giffen (José Antonio Muñoz), and Roger Cruz (Jim Lee and Joe Madureira).|$|R

25|$|On 28 December 1999, 10,000 card <b>swipe</b> {{machines}} {{issued by}} HSBC and manufactured by Racal stopped processing credit and debit card transactions. The stores relied on paper transactions until the machines started working again on 1 January.|$|E
25|$|The British major {{even took}} a <b>swipe</b> at William Alexander, Lord Stirling {{who was not}} even {{involved}} in the operation. Alexander had made an unsuccessful attempt to claim a Scottish earldom between 1756 and 1762. His hard-drinking ways were well-known to British officers.|$|E
40|$|In English, when a {{question}} involving a prepositional wh-phrase (wh-PP) undergoes sluicing, the wh-word may be inverted around the preposition, {{in a process}} known as 2 ̆ 7 <b>swiping</b> 2 ̆ 7. I show, contrary to previous work, that <b>swiping</b> is not restricted to sluicing contexts: it is also permitted when the inverted wh-PP is coordinated with another wh-phrase (e. g., 2 ̆ 2 When and who by was this first discovered? 2 ̆ 2). I argue that English syntax is able to generate <b>swiped</b> structures in all questions involving wh-PPs, including 2 ̆ 7 simple 2 ̆ 7 (non-sluiced, non-coordinated) wh-questions. <b>Swiping</b> in simple wh-questions is subsequently ruled out on prosodic grounds. The account crucially relies on coordinated wh-questions having the same prosodic signature as Right Node Raising constructions...|$|R
5000|$|Android 4.2 added {{additional}} features {{to the user}} interface; the lock screen can be <b>swiped</b> to the left to display widget pages, and <b>swiped</b> {{to the right to}} go to the camera. A pane of [...] "quick settings" [...] toggles (a feature often seen in OEM Android skins) was also added to the notification area - accessible by either <b>swiping</b> down with two fingers on phones, <b>swiping</b> down from the top-right edge of the screen on tablets, or pressing a button on the top-right corner of the notifications pane. The previous [...] "Browser" [...] application was officially deprecated on 4.2 in favor of Google Chrome for Android. 4.2 also adds gesture typing on the keyboard, a redesigned clock app, and a new screen saver system known as [...] "Daydreams". On tablets, Android 4.2 also supports multiple users.|$|R
