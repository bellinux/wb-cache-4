50|$|A <b>semi-drying</b> <b>oil</b> is an oil which {{partially}} hardens when it {{is exposed}} to air. This is {{as opposed to a}} to drying oil, which hardens completely, or a non-drying oil, which does not harden at all. Oils with an iodine number of 115-130 are considered semi-drying.|$|E
50|$|Sesame oil is a {{polyunsaturated}} (PUFA) <b>semi-drying</b> <b>oil.</b> Commercial {{sesame oil}} varies in colour from light to deep reddish yellow {{depending on the}} colour of the seed processed and the method of milling. Provided the oil is milled from well-cleaned seed, it can be refined and bleached easily to yield a light-coloured limpid oil. Sesame oil is rich in oleic and linoleic acids, which together account for 85% of the total fatty acids. Sesame oil has a relatively high percentage of unsaponifiable matter (1.5-2.3%) in India and in some other European countries. It is obligatory to add sesame oil (5-10%) to margarine and generally to hydrogenated vegetable fats which are commonly used as adulterants for butter or ghee.|$|E

2500|$|Egusi-itoo is {{primarily}} grown for the oily seeds it produces. Seeds are commonly ground up {{and used to}} thicken soups and stews or as an ingredient in dumplings. Another consumption of egusi-itoo is in patty form after oil has been extracted from the seed, it is then eaten as a protein substitute. Most commonly it is dehulled and consumed as a snack. [...] In Northern Ghana egusi oil {{is the second most}} prominent cooking oil. The kernel of the egusi-itoo seed contains <b>semi-drying</b> <b>oils</b> which can be used for making soaps, cooking and for illumination, {{with the rest of the}} seed fed to livestock. [...] The flesh of Cucumeropsis mannii is edible but is not commonly consumed due to its bitter taste. [...] In some countries such as Ghana the juice of the fruit is used as healing ointment.|$|R
50|$|Niger seed yields about 30-35% of {{its weight}} in oil which is clear, slow-drying, and edible. Niger seed oil is {{polyunsaturated}} <b>semi-drying</b> <b>oil.</b> It has pale yellow or orange color with a nutty taste and sweet odor. Raw oil has low acidity {{and can be}} used directly for cooking. Normally it has a poor shelf life and will become rancid when stored for a long period. Its fatty acid composition is similar to sunflower oil and has high content of linoleic acid. It is used as a substitute for olive oil and can be mixed with linseed oil. The presence of linoleic acid varies from 45.0-65.0% depending on harvested soil conditions and seed variety. The physical character of oil and its fatty acid composition is furnished in the following tables.|$|E

30|$|Although {{traditional}} household paints {{were based}} on linseed oil alone soon it became common to use oils in admixture to obtain optimum results. For example, the use of tung oil in various combinations with linseed oil was recommended [2, 22] {{as well as the}} use of other drying or semi-drying oils such as perilla, oiticica, soybean, fish and dehydrated castor oil [11]. However, the identification of these or other types of drying or <b>semi-drying</b> <b>oil</b> recommended in the technical literature was not possible {{because of the lack of}} specific chemical markers for these materials.|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of making bioplastics out of oil cake from Crambe Abyssinica, Brassica Carinata and Brassica Napus (Rapeseed) was studied {{in order to}} produce added value for these by-products. The materials were hot pressed and extruded at 100 ˚C using glycerol as a plasticizer. Pressing without plasticizer produced brittle materials. Tensile properties, moisture content, water and oil absorption were determined for the hot pressed sheets. Ball milling of the oil cake did not result in improved properties of the pressed sheets. As the three plants all have <b>semi-drying</b> <b>oils,</b> a siccative was added in different concentrations to crosslink the oil and add to the matrix of the bioplastic. Sheets were pressed after preheating the materials 0 h, 2 h or 6 h. Sheets were also pressed from granulated extrudate with different concentrations of siccative after pre-heating for 0 h or 2 h. Tensile properties, moisture content, water and oil absorption were determined for the pressed sheets. Pre-heating before pressing had a larger impact than siccative concentration on the properties of crambe and carinata sheets. Siccative concentration had larger influences on the properties of rapeseed cake sheets. Carinata and rapeseed cake were easier to process than crambe as they flowed better. Carinata sheets and extrudates were more flexible than crambe and rapeseed cake sheets and extrudates. A tray could be pressed from a mixture of crambe and rapeseed cake. All three materials show potential to be used as bioplastics for rigid items, perhaps in packaging applications...|$|R
40|$|Oilseeds such as flax, canola, safflower, soybean and sunflower, {{which are}} annual plants, provide the world’s {{major source of}} {{vegetable}} oils, although the highest oil yield comes from oil-bearing tree fruits. One {{of the most popular}} oil seeds is safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.), which belongs to the Asteraceae family. Due to the ability of this plant to grow in dry and <b>semi-dry</b> conditions, safflower <b>oil</b> {{has the potential to be}} a commercially profitable product in Iran. Seasonal populations of safflower capsule flies were studied in Kohgiluyeh safflower farms, Iran, from March to May in 2008 and 2009. Four yellow sticky traps were used to monitor populations of fruit flies in the safflower farms. Traps were checked once a week during the sampling period. The traps were emptied weekly into insect collection vials containing 70 % ethanol. Data were analysed with a two-way ANOVA. The relation between abiotic factors and species abundance was analysed with multiple linear regression. The results emphasized that Acanthiophilus helianthi was the most serious pest of safflower under the ecological conditions found in Gachsaran, being present in the field throughout three months of the year (March to May). Chaetorellia carthami was present in safflower fields from March to May, but in significant numbers only during April and May. Terellia luteola was present in safflower fields from March to May and in significant numbers only in late April, it does not seem to be a serious pest in safflower farms under Gachsaran’s ecological conditions...|$|R
40|$|Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) {{seeds are}} rich in oil and free of nicotine. The content of oil (tobacco seed oil TSO) varies between 30 % and 43 % (w/w) and it is {{classified}} as <b>semi-drying</b> <b>oil.</b> The extracted oil {{can be used for}} several purposes, also as edible oil. The aim {{of this study is to}} find the best conditions of tobacco seeds oil (TSO) press extraction, combining multiple extraction factors such as screw rotational speed, seeds preheating and extraction temperature, in order to have an higher oil yield. The limit range of three experimental parameters have been chosen through preliminary tests. Results show that the combination of high extraction temperature, slow rotational screw speed and seeds preheating has a significant effect on oil yield: 25 % (w/w) more than lowest yield among investigated conditions...|$|E
40|$|Castor oil is classed as <b>semi-drying</b> <b>oil</b> {{because it}} oxidizes on {{exposure}} to air, giving a gummy film, {{and can be}} highly sulphated to make it miscible in water. In the raw condition it is seldom used in fatliquoring of leather because the softness and flexibility of the leather will decrease on storage as the castor oil dries. Castor seeds were collected, sundried, and crushed. Castor oil was extracted in a soxhlet apparatus using hexane as a solvent.. A yield of 90 %was obtained. Physical and chemical analyses were carried out for the obtained crude oil. The crude oil was converted to fatliquor by sulphation process using sulphuric acid. The physical and chemical analyses were carried out for the produced fatliquor and compared with the standards. This paper carried out experimental study, through extraction and characterization of castor oil. Normal hexane {{was used as a}} solvent for the extraction process. The characterization analysis revealed that tested parameters, which include specific gravity, refractive index, acid, saponification and iodine values for both crude and refined castor oil produced, were within the ASTM standard specifications...|$|E
30|$|In this study, Py–THM–GCMS {{demonstrated}} that the organic fraction of the house paints tested (primarily French oil-based Ripolin enamels) is composed of heat-bodied linseed oil in admixture with Pinaceae resin, with evidence for the addition of castor and rapeseed oil found in a few samples. The identification {{of other types of}} drying oils such as soybean, perilla or fish oil recommended for industrial oil-based paints in technical literature is challenging because of similarities in their fatty acid composition. As a comparison, the results from the tube oil paints suggested the use of more than one type of drying or <b>semi-drying</b> <b>oil,</b> as indicated by the more divergent P/S ratios {{and for the most part}} they seem to have undergone little or no heat-bodying. Trace levels of Pinaceae resin were found only in a few tube paints, and beeswax was detected in one example. DTMS and ESI–MS data complemented the Py–THM–GCMS analyses, providing indications of the cross-linking and prepolymerization reactions occurring during processing of the oils, and as a result of reaction between the oil and resin components of the paints. Further research on a broader range of reference materials should help in the development of refined strategies for characterizing oil-based paints from the early 20 th century.|$|E
40|$|The {{seeds of}} C. cleomifolia (locally known as kacang hantu) {{collected}} along Simpang Pulai - Berinchang Road, Cameron Highlands, was defatted with hexane {{and the resulting}} oil was analysed for their physico-chemical properties. The percentage yield of the oil was calculated as 5. 3 %. The acid value (1. 2 %), iodine value (85), peroxide value (0. 6), saponification value (192. 0) and unsaponifiable matter (2. 3 %) were determined to assess {{the quality of the}} oil. The physico-chemical characterisation showed that C. cleomifolia seeds oil is unsaturated <b>semi-drying</b> <b>oil,</b> with high saponifi cation and acidic values. The fatty acid composition of C. cleomifolia seed oil was determined by Gas Chromatography and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (ToF). The seed oil of C. cleomifolia contained linoleic acid (57. 59 %) and palmitic acid (5. 07 %), the most abundant unsaturated and saturated fatty acids, respectively.

40|$|The {{sunflower}} (Helianthus annuus L.) is {{native to}} the western U. S., but principal commercial production of the seed for oil is in other countries, especially Russia. World production of oil averaged near 8, 026, 150 tons from 1992 to 1994, and sunflower oil production in the U. S. has increased since 1966. Sunflowers are grown from southern Canada south to Mexico and Argentina and is the state flower of Kansas. The plant is a large, rough annual, with a stiff stem up to 10 or 12 feet tall. Leaves are cordate to ovate, rough, up to 12 inches long. The angular seeds are up to 1 / 2 inch long and are densely packed in the flat, terminal heads, which {{may be more than}} a foot across. Seeds are exposed in the head during growth. Seeds normally contain about 25 percent of the <b>semi-drying</b> <b>oil,</b> but this has been increased through breeding to above 40 percent. Oil is usually expressed by an initial cold press, followed by hot-pressing. The cold press oil is used as a salad and cooking oil and for margarine, the hot-press mainly in industry for paints, plastics, soaps, detergents and as a pesticide adjuvant. Oilseed sunflower seeds are usually smaller and are black in color. Oilseed hybrids generally have a thin The Crop Profile/PMSP database, including this document, is supported by USDA NIFA. hull that adheres to the kernel.

40|$|The {{advent of}} World War II {{cut off from}} the North American {{continent}} supplies of imported vegetable oils. This focused attention on a search for new plant sources, increased production from available sources and alteration of available vegetable oils by physical and chemical processes to meet industrial demands. This resulted in stimulation of the vegetable oil industry. The maintenance of this industry against competition from oil exporting countries requires production of superior oil products at costs which will not be excessive. In addition to production of oils in competition with imported oils, there has been an increased demand for modified oils specifically adapted for certain purposes, e. g., fast-drying oils. The modification of vegetable oils may be aided by a knowledge of the acids and glycerides that are present. Sunflower seed (Helianthus annus) is grown extensively in Russia, Argentine, China, Hungary and United States. Commercial production of sunflower seed in Canada has increased rapidly since 1941 as a war measure. The two main varieties are Sunrise and Mennonite, which are adapted to regions of a relatively long frost free period. Approximately 20, 000 acres were seeded in Manitoba in 1945, and two oil expeller mills have been built in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. The oil is an edible, <b>semi-drying</b> <b>oil</b> used extensively for Cooking and salad oils, shortenings and, to a limited extent, for paints and varnishes. Jamieson (63) gives the following fatty acid composition: oleic 33. 4, linoleic 57. 5, palmitic 3. 5, stearic 2. 9, arachidic 0. 6 and lignoceric 0. 4. Linolenic acid is not detected by chemical analyses. The present investigation Was undertaken to determine: (1) the relation of iodine value to fatty acid composition, (2) the glyceride structure by fractional crystallization, (3) if changes in the glyceride structure induced by physical and chemical treatment, such as molecular rearrangements, could be detected by fractional crystallization...|$|E
