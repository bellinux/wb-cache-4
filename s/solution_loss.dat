40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} radical {{approach}} to obtaining a backtrack-free representation for a constraint satisfaction problem: remove values that lead to dead-ends. This technique does not require additional space but has the drawback of removing solutions. We investigate a number of variations on the basic algorithm {{including the use of}} seed solutions, consistency techniques, and a variety of pruning heuristics. Our experimental results indicate that a significant proportion of the solutions to the original problem can be retained especially when an optimization algorithm that specifically searches for such “good ” backtrack-free representations is employed. Further extensions increase solution retention by searching for high-coverage backtrack-free representations, by removing tuples rather than values, and by combining multiple backtrack-free representations. Our approach elucidates, for the first time, a three-way trade-off between space complexity, potential backtracks, and <b>solution</b> <b>loss</b> and enables algorithms that can actively reason about the trade-off between space, backtracks, and <b>solution</b> <b>loss...</b>|$|E

40|$|Constraint {{programming}} is a paradigm wherein relations between variables are {{stated in the}} form of constraints. It is well-known that many real life problems can be modeled as Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). Much effort has been spent to increase the efficiency of algorithms for solving CSPs. However, many of these techniques assume that the set of variables, domains and constraints involved in the CSP are known and fixed when the problem is modeled. This is a strong limitation because many problems come from uncertain and dynamic environments, where both the original problem may evolve because of the environment, the user or other agents. In such situations, a solution that holds for the original problem can become invalid after changes. There are two main approaches for dealing with these situations: reactive and proactive approaches. Using reactive approaches entails re-solving the CSP after each <b>solution</b> <b>loss,</b> which is a time consuming. That is a clear disadvantage, especially when we deal with short-term changes, where <b>solution</b> <b>loss</b> is frequent. In addition, in many applications, such as on-line planning and scheduling, the delivery time of a new solution may be too long for actions to be taken on time, so a <b>solution</b> <b>loss</b> can produce several negative effects in the modeled problem. For a task assignment production system with several machines, it could cause the shutdown of the production system, the breakage of machines, the loss of the material/object in production, etc. In a transport timetabling problem, the <b>solution</b> <b>loss,</b> due to some disruption at a point, may produce a delay that propagates through the entire schedule. In addition, all the negative effects stated above will probably entail an economic loss. In this thesis we develop several proactive approaches. Proactive approaches use knowledge about possible future changes in order to avoid or minimize their effects. These approaches are applied before the changes occur. Thus, our approaches search for robust solutions, which have a high probability to remain valid after changes. Furthermore, some of our approaches also consider that the solutions can be easily adapted when they did not resist the changes in the original problem. Thus, these approaches search for stable solutions, which have an alternative solution that is similar to the previous one and therefore can be used in case of a value breakage. In this context, sometimes there exists knowledge about the uncertain and dynamic environment. However in many cases, this information is unknown or hard to obtain. For this reason, for the majority of our approaches (specifically 3 of the 4 developed approaches), the only assumptions made about changes are those inherent in the structure of problems with ordered domains. Given this framework and therefore the existence of a significant order over domain values, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that the original bounds of the solution space may undergo restrictive or relaxed modifications. Note that the possibility of <b>solution</b> <b>loss</b> only exists when changes over the original bounds of the solution space are restrictive. Therefore, the main objective for searching robust solutions in this framework is to find solutions located as far away as possible from the bounds of the solution space. In order to meet this criterion, we propose several approaches that can be divided in enumeration-based techniques and a search algorithm. Climent Aunes, LI. (2013).

40|$|We propose and {{characterize}} a new {{solution for}} problems with asymmetric bargaining power among the agents that we named weighted proportional <b>losses</b> <b>solution.</b> It is specially interesting when agents are bargaining under restricted probabilistic uncertainty. The weighted proportional losses assigns to each agent losses proportional to her ideal utility and also proportional to her bargaining power. This solution is always individually rational, even for 3 or more agents {{and it can}} be seen as the normalized weighted equal <b>losses</b> <b>solution.</b> When bargaining power among the agents is equal, the weighted proportional <b>losses</b> <b>solution</b> becomes the Kalai-Smorodinsky solution. We characterize our solution in the basis of restricted monotonicity and restricted concavity. A consequence of this result is an alternative characterization of Kalai-Smorodinsky solution which includes contexts with some kind of uncertainty. Finally we show that weighted proportional <b>losses</b> <b>solution</b> satisfyies desirable properties as are strong Pareto optimality for 2 agents and continuity also fulfilled by Kalai-Smorodinsky solution, that are not satisfied either by weighted or asymmetric Kalai-Smorodinsky solutions. ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>solution</b> {{transport}} <b>losses</b> in a one-dimensional solar-driven water-splitting {{cell that}} operates in either concentrated acid, dilute acid, or buffered near-neutral pH electrolytes {{have been evaluated}} using a mathematical model that accounts for diffusion, migration and convective transport, {{as well as for}} bulk electrochemical reactions in the electrolyte. The Ohmic resistance loss, the Nernstian potential loss associated with pH gradients at the surface of the electrode, and electrodialysis in different electrolytes were assessed quantitatively in a stagnant cell as well as in a bubble-convected cell, in which convective mixing occurred due to product-gas evolution. In a stagnant cell that did not have convective mixing, small limiting current densities (< 3 mA cm^(− 2)) and significant polarization losses derived from pH gradients were present in dilute acid as well as in near-neutral pH buffered electrolytes. In contrast, bubble-convected cells exhibited {{a significant increase in the}} limiting current density, and a significant reduction of the concentration overpotentials. In a bubble-convected cell, minimal <b>solution</b> transport <b>losses</b> were present in membrane-free cells, in either buffered electrolytes or in unbuffered solutions with pH ≤ 1. However, membrane-free cells lack a mechanism for product-gas separation, presenting significant practical and engineering impediments to the deployment of such systems.

The accompanying <b>solution</b> <b>losses,</b> especially the pH gradients at the electrode surfaces, were modeled and simulated for such a system.

30|$|The {{kinetics}} of coke <b>solution</b> <b>loss</b> reaction {{with and}} without sodium carbonate were investigated with CO 2 as a reaction atmosphere using the thermogravimetric analyzer. In the primary experiment, two variables (gas flow rate and coke particle size) were studied. As the results showed, 120  mL/min is sufficient to avoid the external mass diffusion, and the internal diffusion is negligible when the particle size is lower than 0.075  mm. The improved method combined the least square with the genetic algorithm was implemented to solve the homogeneous model and the shrinking core model. By investigating the fitness function at each generation, {{it was found that}} the improved genetic algorithm method has good stability to solve two models. Based on estimated reaction rate constant, kinetic parameters were obtained using the Arrhenius Law. In the homogeneous model, the activation energy {{with and without}} sodium carbonate was 54.89 and 95.56  kJ/mol, respectively. And, the activation energy with and without sodium carbonate in the shrinking core model was 49.83 and 92.18  kJ/mol, respectively. Therefore, it was obvious that Na 2 CO 3 has a catalytic action during coke <b>solution</b> <b>loss</b> reaction. The estimated carbon conversions obtained from two models with the LS-GA method agreed well with experimental datum, indicating that the calculated kinetic parameters were valid and the method combined the least square with the genetic algorithm was successfully developed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{constraint}} satisfaction problem (CSP) {{model can be}} preprocessed to ensure that any choices made will lead to solutions, without the need to backtrack. This can be especially useful in a real-time process control or online interactive context. The conventional machinery for ensuring backtrack-free search, however, adds additional constraints, which may require an impractical amount of space. A new approach is presented here that achieves a backtrack-free representation by removing values. This may limit the choice of solutions, but we are guaranteed not to eliminate them all.

We show that n-player bargaining problems have a unique self-supporting outcome under the Kalai-Smorodinsky solution. For all possible loss aversion coefficients we determine the bargaining solutions that give exactly these outcomes, and characterize them by the standard axioms of Scale Invariance, Individual Monotonicity, and Strong Individual Rationality, and a new axiom called Proportional Concession Invariance (PCI).
