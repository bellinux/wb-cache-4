In this episode, Mulder and Scully {{investigate}} a murder {{that seems to have}} been committed by a blind woman, Marty Glenn (Lili Taylor), but Mulder suspects that she is capable of seeing images in <b>some</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> Eventually, it is revealed that Glenn, while blind, can see the actions of her murderous father via her mind's eye.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane {{establishes}} {{the book as}} a work of normative political theory asking to what extent animals {{should be included in the}} domain of justice. States can and do regulate human-animal relationships, whether the animals in question are used in agriculture, as companions, or in <b>some</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> Cochrane's focus is not on why laws are passed or on comparing laws, but in exploring what kind of laws should be passed. As his focus is on political theory, he is less concerned with questions about individual moral obligations than he is with institutional arrangements. He notes, however, that questions about animals have been neglected in political theory. In the second chapter, Cochrane considers the history of thinking on the relationship between justice and animals. He argues that within ancient philosophy there was disagreement about the inclusion of animals within accounts of justice, in medieval Christian philosophy there was a consensus that they should be excluded, and in modern philosophy there has been a return to disagreement.|$|E

5|$|While Fingal was {{discharging}} her cargo, Bulloch went to Richmond {{to confer}} with Stephen Mallory, Secretary of the Navy. Mallory endorsed Bulloch's plan to load Fingal with cotton to sell on the Navy Department's account {{to be used to}} purchase more ships and equipment in Europe. He returned to Savannah on 23 November and it took him almost a month to purchase a cargo and acquire enough coal. He made one attempt to break through the blockade on 23 December, but it proved impossible to do as the Union controlled every channel from Savannah, aided by their occupation of Tybee Island {{at the mouth of the}} Savannah River. Bulloch reported to Mallory in late January 1862 that breaking out was hopeless so Mallory ordered him to turn the ship over to another officer and to return to Europe <b>some</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b>|$|E

25|$|So the {{function}} of satisfaction for Aquinas is not to placate a wrathful God or in <b>some</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> remove the constraints which compel God to damn sinners. Instead, {{the function}} of satisfaction is to restore a sinner {{to a state of}} harmony with God by repairing or restoring in the sinner what sin has damaged. This is Aquinas' major difference with Anselm. Rather than seeing the debt as one of honor, he sees the debt as a moral injustice to be righted.|$|E
25|$|The {{most obvious}} {{evidence}} for this model is that carnivorous plants tend to grow in habitats where water and light are abundant and where competition is relatively low: the typical bog.

25|$|A {{receiving}} woman's {{legs and}} arms are generally free to move about, though her position and movement may be constrained by the penetrating partner's weight and in <b>some</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> A woman can adjust the position of her legs for comfort, variety and to control the angle and depth of penetration. Generally, the higher a woman's legs, the deeper is the penetration. When the legs are raised in any way, the woman has less control of the rhythm of thrusts. Also, raising the legs raises the woman's pelvis, reduces the angle of penetration, and lowers the level of clitoral stimulation.|$|E
25|$|A retail {{electricity}} market exists when end-use {{customers can}} choose their supplier from competing electricity retailers; one term {{used in the}} United States {{for this type of}} consumer choice is 'energy choice'. A separate issue for electricity markets is whether or not consumers face real-time pricing (prices based on the variable wholesale price) or a price that is set in <b>some</b> <b>other</b> <b>way,</b> such as average annual costs. In many markets, consumers do not pay based on the real-time price, and hence have no incentive to reduce demand at times of high (wholesale) prices or to shift their demand to other periods. Demand response may use pricing mechanisms or technical solutions to reduce peak demand.|$|E

25|$|Prior {{to the end}} of the Cold War, the {{consensus}} among students of large-scale violence was that ethnic groups should be considered irrational actors, or semi-rational at best. If true, general explanations of ethnic violence would be impossible. In the years since, however, scholarly consensus has shifted to consider that ethnic groups may in fact be counted as rational actors, and the puzzle of their apparently irrational actions (for example, fighting over territory of little or no intrinsic worth) must therefore be explained in <b>some</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> As a result, the possibility of a general explanation of ethnic violence has grown, and collaboration between comparativist and international-relations sub-fields has resulted in increasingly useful theories of ethnic conflict.|$|E
25|$|Firstly, if the omniscient mean {{is unknown}} (and is {{computed}} as the sample mean), then the sample variance is a biased estimator: it underestimates the variance {{by a factor}} of (n−1) / n; correcting by this factor (dividing by n−1 instead of n) is called Bessel's correction. The resulting estimator is unbiased, and is called the (corrected) sample variance or unbiased sample variance. For example, when n=1 the variance of a single observation about the sample mean (itself) is obviously zero regardless of the population variance. If the mean is determined in <b>some</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> than from the same samples used to estimate the variance then this bias does not arise and the variance can safely be estimated as that of the samples about the (independently known) mean.|$|E
25|$|Peter Fritsch and his coauthors {{decided to}} do a more {{comprehensive}} test for carnivory on P. minensis after they observed nematode worms on leaf surfaces. The similarity between the habitat for Philcoxia species and that of Genlisea and their similar subterranean leaves and stems spurred the team's decision to test for potential carnivory {{in the field and}} in situ. They tested for a protease enzyme {{that is one of the}} enzymes found in other carnivorous plants and is responsible for breaking down captured prey. They hypothesized that Philcoxia could be carnivorous, capturing nematodes and possibly soil microbes like Utricularia and Genlisea do. Ultimately, Fritsch's study concluded that while no protease activity was detected, this fact does not rule out the possibility that the genus may be carnivorous in <b>some</b> <b>other</b> <b>way.</b> They note that there are many possibilities, such as seasonal carnivory or the unusual growth form being an adaptation to the heat and sun, and more study is needed before precise conclusions can be reached.|$|E
