Neptunium pyrophosphate (α-NpP2O7), a green solid, has been produced in the reaction between neptunium dioxide and boron phosphate at 1100°C, though neptunium(IV) phosphate has so far remained elusive.

"Thesis supervisor: Dr. Bongkosh Vardhanabhuti. Heating protein with {{polysaccharide}} under a net {{negative condition}} can induce {{the formation of}} <b>soluble</b> <b>complex</b> with improved functional properties. Studies on foaming properties of whey protein isolate (WPI) with polysaccharide mostly focused {{on the effects of}} polysaccharide on native WPI or heated WPI, while little has been done on heated WPI-polysaccharide <b>soluble</b> <b>complex.</b> The objective of our research was to investigate effects of different [lambda]-carrageenan ([lambda]C) concentrations and pH on foaming properties of heated WPI and [lambda]C <b>soluble</b> <b>complex.</b> Three WPI and [lambda]C systems were prepared: 1) heated WPI and [lambda]C <b>soluble</b> <b>complex</b> (h-cpx), (2) heated WPI with added [lambda]C (pWPI - [lambda]C), and (3) unheated WPI with [lambda]C (WPI-[lambda]C). Foams were generated by beating the solution using a KitchenAid mixer. Foamability and foam stability were determined by measuring the foam overrun and drainage 1 / 5 life, respectively. Foam rheological properties were determined using a Kinexus Pro Rheometer, while foam microstructures were visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). For native WPI and [lambda]C mixed system, [lambda]C was needed in order for 5 % WPI to form measurable foams. In all three WPI- [lambda]C systems at neutral pH, increasing [lambda]C concentration led to improved foamability which increased with increasing [lambda]C concentration until a certain concentration before it decreased. Interestingly, despite their higher viscosity, both heated systems (pWPI-[lambda]C and h-cpx) showed significantly better foamability and foam stability compared to WPI-[lambda]C. Results of rheological properties of foams made from treatments with 0. 25 % [lambda]C at neutral pH suggested that higher elasticity and viscous films were produced in h-cpx and pWPI-[lambda]C systems corresponding to better foam stability. Heating WPI and [lambda]C together to form heated <b>soluble</b> <b>complex</b> resulted in thicker and viscoelastic interfacial film surrounding the air bubbles and thus better foamIncludes bibliographical references (pages 64 - 70) ...|$|R

Should ISA concentrations within the facility exceed 10−5 mol L-1 (2x10−5 mol L−1 in the case of Th(IV)), it was reported that the sorption onto the calcite would be significantly affected such that the radionuclides studied would no longer be sorbed to the cement and instead be complexed with the ISA.|$|E
