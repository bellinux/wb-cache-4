40|$|Structural {{serviceability}} is of uttermost {{importance for}} the overall performance of many common structures. As a rule, both the load effects (serviceability indicators due to loading) and admissible constraints (ensuring required structural performance) are random variables of considerable scatter and significant vagueness. Common experience indicates that a structure does not loose its ability to comply with specified performance requirements abruptly at a distinct point of the serviceability indicator, but gradually within a certain transition interval. Fuzzy-probabilistic methods are therefore employed to analyze the structural serviceability. As an example, serviceability limit states of water retaining structures with respect to cracking are investigated in detail. Fuzzy probabilistic models are proposed to derive theoretical models for the limiting crack width. It is shown that the fuzzy probabilistic distribution of serviceability requirements may be used similarly as classical distribution function to <b>specify</b> the <b>characteristic</b> <b>value</b> of limiting crack width, to analyze reliability of crack width and to optimize structural design to achieve the minimum total costs...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the <b>characteristic</b> <b>value</b> {{determination}} from relatively small samples. When the distribution and its parameters of a random variable are known, the <b>characteristic</b> <b>value</b> is deterministic quantity. However, in practical problems the parameters of distribution are unknown and can only be estimated from random samples. Therefore the <b>characteristic</b> <b>value</b> is by itself a random variable. The estimates of <b>characteristic</b> <b>values</b> are strongly dependant {{on the distribution of}} random variable. In the paper we show the analytical solution for <b>characteristic</b> <b>value</b> determination from random samples of normal and lognormal random variables. The confirmation of analytical results is accomplished by the use of computer simulations. For Gumbel, and Weibull distribution the <b>characteristic</b> <b>value</b> estimates are obtained numerically by combination of simulations and bisection method. In the paper the numerical results are presented for 5 % <b>characteristic</b> <b>values</b> with 75 % confidence interval, which is in accord with the majority of European building standards.
