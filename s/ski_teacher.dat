40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to analyse the effect of two {{feedback}} types as strategies in training <b>ski</b> <b>teachers</b> and to verify their effectiveness in the students’ learning. Thirty <b>ski</b> <b>teachers</b> participated in the study (average age= 32. 0 ± 5. 4 years; average experience in ski teaching= 10. 0 ± 3 years). The teachers were divided into two experimental groups (group I: verbal feedback; group II: visual and verbal feedback) and one control group. Fifteen teaching trials were performed by each teacher, and a subsequent instructional supervision meeting was carried out in order to analyse quality of feedbacks delivered during the trial. A total of 180 high school students participated in the study as ski learners. During the instructional supervision meeting, the teachers were guided towards a previously established theoretical model of feedback used as the evaluation criterion. The ARIMA analysis of the time series showed changes in baseline teacher behaviour (group II came closer to the model established and concentrated better than group I; both experimental groups were better than the control group). The results of the analysis of variance for the comparison of students’ learning were also in the same direction: the students of group II teachers obtained better results than their peers of group I, and both experimental group’s students were better than those pertaining to the control group. We recommend using the criteria of the feedback model in order to achieve better quality of <b>teacher</b> training in <b>skiing...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{educational}} process, {{which takes}} place in school is upgraded and continued in nature classes. It is a pedagogical process lasting several days and containing an educational {{as well as a}} schooling aspect. It is based on the mutual connection of the contextual and organisational parts combining a whole. Such process assures the personal development of a child in all aspects of the educational planning and practice. This leads to the “hidden” learning and education, which emerge as a by-product of the organisation of the curriculum and the school. Nature classes are identified as a special educational form, where {{for a period of time}} a whole class or several classes go out into the natural, less urban environment outside of the place where they permanently reside. This means going to the sea, to the river, to the lake, into the woods, to the mountains, to the snowy nature and similar places. In the winter time in primary schools the winter nature classes take place. To be able to teach properly and successfully, a <b>ski</b> <b>teacher</b> or a sports pedagogue has to be acquainted with the integrity of a child’s development, with the basis of a teaching and learning process of children, the pedagogical and didactical peculiarities of ski-teaching for children, the psychological principals and techniques as well as with the ski-methodologies. Teaching has to take place in a relaxed atmosphere, through game, joy and enjoying the snow. The <b>ski</b> <b>teacher</b> has to manage his role of an animator and a promoter of winter tourism to perfection. In this diploma thesis the ski techniques and methodology are further described. The ski instructor must pay attention to the safety on the ski slopes, he or she must know and implement the rules regarding the safety and educate the future skiers with his or her own exemplary behaviour. It is desired that the ski instructor uses good skiing equipment (the ski helmet, ski goggles, ski suit, ski gloves, comfortable ski boots and adequate length of the ski poles and skis). Education is an important part of cohabitation with children on the snow covered slopes. It is present the whole time during the activities. The kids are thought about the proper attitude towards the nature. The second part of the diploma thesis contains 5 teaching preparations with the analyses for the carefully planned, gradual and especially successful teaching of skiing in the winter nature classes. The teaching preparations have been carried out in practice within the framework of the ski school in Italy. 11 participants, aged 10 - 12, participated. The teaching preparations are not too complex and are suitable for the realization in a 5 -day winter nature class. One teaching preparation is the basis for a one day ski lesson in the nature classes. ...|$|E

The following year at Engelberg, Switzerland, he won the combined, and took silver in the downhill and slalom. He created the École Française de Ski which taught innovative methods of Anton Seelos (who was his trainer and instructor), characterised by parallel turns, controlling the speed by sideslipping, and turning by ruade (French: kick, back kick), i.e. kicking the backs of the skis up and pivoting on the tips while rotating the body {{in the direction of the}} turn.

40|$|International audienceBackground:ALS {{clustering}} {{is important}} to describe {{as it may be}} helpful for uncovering/studying potential causes of ALS. Objectives:To describe a clustering of ALS cases in a small hamlet in the French Alps and discuss potential exposures in the patients’ environment. Cases: Between 1991 and 2013, five ALS cases were described in the small hamlet of Montchavin, Savoie, France. Two of them were spouses. They have all lived in the hamlet since early childhood or birth. Patients were all neighbours and the hamlet comprised 200 persons livinghere on a regular basis. Between 2010 and 2015, seven other cases of ALS were identified in individuals that did not originate from thevillage but spent a part of their life in the area. One had lived here since 2009, another spent half of his lifetime in Montchavin, two were present during holidays for more than 20 years, and two others lived in close villages and had an activity, professional or leisure, in the hamlet. Results:The study of the cases did not identify any genetic/familial relationships between the patients and, when possible, a genetic analysis was performed and was negative. For the 5 ALS patients originating from the area, given the interval of observation, 22 years, the population of 200 and the incidence of ALS, 2. 5 / 100, 000, the standardized incidence ratio¼ 45 (p 50. 00001). It does not seem possible to estimate an incidence ratio for the whole group of 12 patients in the cluster area, as the population during winter and summertime greatly increases, and forseven of them, exposure was not continuous. Exposures:Common exposures were found between the 12 patients: all but one practiced sport intensively, eight had a vegetable garden, six used to eat local mushrooms, five were <b>ski</b> <b>teachers,</b> and four had a restaurant. The water used for the vegetable gardens was collected immediately downstream from the ski area where snow guns were intensively using snomax for artificial snow, with a mix containing bacteria. Among the five ALS cases originating from the area, four of them were chronically exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and in two houses an abnormally high level of radon was measured (4400 Beq/m 3, with a maximum at 1116). Discussion:We present a highly significant cluster of ALS in a small hamlet in the French Alps. Patients are neighbours and share many exposures, some of them being known for their toxicity regarding neuronal/cellular metabolism. Others factors are more exploratory, such as vegetable gardens where heavy metals may be implicated. The investigation of BMAA is underway in the area, {{as well as in the}} patients’ brains that have been collected. four patients are still alive and these brains may be collected in the future...|$|R
5000|$|In early 1938 Balet was {{recruited}} by the German military and because his ancestor's passport was not complete, he was forbidden to associate further with the Akademie der Bildenden Künste München. Later that year Balet emigrated to the USA, settled in New York and painted rustic furniture for a living. One winter he jobbed as a <b>skiing</b> <b>teacher</b> in Vermont and occasionally jobbed as an advertising commercial artist. Among other projects, he painted the cafeteria of the largest of New York's department stores R.H. Macy. He married a young woman named Bertha Quinn and in 1940 his son Peter was born. From time to time Balet's designs appeared in the fashion magazine Mademoiselle and in 1943 he became Art Director at the magazine. Balet became so successful as a commercial artist {{that he was able}} to give up paid employment and start his own business. He worked for the radio station CBS, magazines such as Vogue, House and Garden, House Beautiful, The Saturday Evening Post, Glamour, Good Housekeeping, This week. After the war ended in 1945 he acquired U.S. citizenship. In 1945 Balet and his wife divorced and Peter and his mother went to live with her parents in Ballston Spa, NY. Balet commuted between his studio in New York and an old, boat house in the dunes of Montauk, Long Island, which he had converted to a studio where he painted and drew. His first children's book Amos and the Moon was published in 1948. Soon after he travelled to Europe to visit his mother and his grandmother in Munich and then spent two months in Paris, which provided great inspiration for his future work. His grandmother died in 1949 at the age of 93 years and Balet said she had been [...] "the most important and dearest person" [...] in his life. Around this time Balet began a relationship with American photo model Lisa Tallal, whom he married a few years later. Balet sold his boat house and purchased his dream house, also on Long Island. Balet and his wife enjoyed an expensive lifestyle which required him to focus on commercial art. During travels to Europe and Mexico Balet took many photographs, since there was insufficient time for drawing. Despite what was regarded in the USA as fashionable art Abstract, Op-art and Popart Balet continued to paint in his own style. His mother died in 1963 and he inherited the house in Munich. As a former pupil of Olaf Gulbransson, Balet was invited, in 1964, to present an exhibition in the Pavillon Alter Botanischer Garten Munich. Many of his children's books and illustrations were included in the exhibition as well as a variety of his commercial artwork. This encouraged Balet to keep on painting in his special style.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to record the characteristics of Switzerland's alpine skier's in relation to the frequency of accidents. The formulation of the cases was based on the following questions: skiers with preparation of their physical fitness before the season and the warming-up before skiing have chances of skiing accidents or injuries? In {{this research}} 49 skiers participated (30 men and 19 women). The specimens came by recreational skiers (beginners - advanced) and athletes in the following ski resorts in Switzerland: Adelboden, Lenk and San Bernardino. The research material came from analysis of completed questionnaires from 49 Swiss skiers. They have recorded four categories of factors: a) individual factors b) factors of preparation in the snow in relation to injuries c) factors of preparation in dry ground in relation to injuries d) factors of injuries. About 1 in 3 Swiss skier respondents had in the past, an accident in alpine skiing. In the Swiss population the number of advanced skiers is overriding, with a few years of training in skiing, however with several days training a year using a <b>ski</b> instructor <b>teacher</b> for warming up and individual form of learning. With regard to injured skiers, athletes are the ones that prevail. The skiers who had prepared themselves with a physical fitness preparation before the winter season had a greater percentage of accidents and injuries, while on the other hand had a reduced rate in relation to injuries or accidents during warm up. Swiss skiers usually had upper limb injuries (sprains and dislocations) due to the fall of the skier. It is recommended that research be done with all the factors for the selection of the best methodology, preparation and adjustment of physical ability in the difficult environment of skiing with respect to accidents and injuries...|$|R
