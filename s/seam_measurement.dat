50|$|If the {{processor}} {{is using the}} micrometer method the regulation requires that three measurements are taken at points approximately 120° apart around the double seam. On three-piece cans the first measurement can be taken directly across from the side seam and the next two measurements are then taken 120° {{to either side of}} the first measurement. On three-piece cans the measurements must be taken at least one-half inch from the side seam juncture as the juncture may interfere with a true <b>seam</b> <b>measurement.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Since {{there are}} several {{parameters}} {{that can be used}} to judge seam quality, the FDA regulation specifies the most critical parameters: [...] "The most critical attributes to consider in judging the quality of the double seam are overlap and tightness (wrinkle). If one of the can <b>seam</b> <b>measurements</b> (i.e., body hook) is slightly beyond the specified guidelines but the rest of the seam is evaluated and the overlap and tightness (wrinkle) are within specified guidelines, then adjustments to the seamer can be made at the next scheduled shut-down. In this instance, the manufacturer should identify the out-of-guideline measurement and document they have evaluated the rest of the double seam, but did not find immediate corrective action necessary. However, if overlap measurement or tightness rating evaluation are below the minimum guidelines a resample from the questionable seaming station should be made. If the resample continues to show out-of-guideline measurements in overlap and/or wrinkle the machine should be stopped and adjusted." ...|$|R

The program covered 5 mines, 4 <b>seams,</b> 6 <b>measurement</b> sets, and 3 geographic areas.

It combines high-precision seam tracking and beam positioning with weld spot visualization and characterization, and <b>seam</b> geometry <b>measurement.</b> The higher overall precision allows operating the process closer to its limits, online quality monitoring detects faults immediately.

40|$|AbstractPast {{work has}} shown large {{variation}} in the drag of baseballs. Little is known concerning the causes of variation in ball drag. Ball diameter, weight, seam height, surface roughness, and shape influence lift and drag, and therefore carry distance. The aim of this work was to quantify the effect of seam height and roundness on ball lift and drag, which, to our understanding, has never been done outside of a wind tunnel. A bespoke, non-contact, ball surface profiler, {{was used to measure}} ball radius, including seam height. The profiles were analyzed to describe ball roundness and seam height separately. Balls with three different seam heights were projected in an enclosed stadium 102 - 122 m (describing a typical fly ball). Redundant radar devices were used to measure launch angle, speed, and flight paths. High speed video was used to confirm launch angle and ball spin rate. Hit distance was verified with a physical tape measure. The ball's roundness influenced the effective height of a <b>seam.</b> <b>Measurements</b> of the non-seam area of a ball were necessary to characterize the seams of a ball. A strong correlation was observed between seam height and a ball's drag coefficient. Lift, however, was not sensitive to seam height or ball shape...|$|R
40|$|In situ {{and near}} {{real-time}} <b>measurements</b> of coal <b>seam</b> thickness {{have been identified}} by industry as a highly desirable component of robotic mining systems. With it, a continuous mining machine can be guided close to the varying boundary of the seam while the cutting operation is underway. This provides the mining operation the ability to leave behind the high-sulfur, high-particulate coal which is concentrated near the seam boundary. The result is near total recovery of high quality coal resources, an increase in mining efficiency, and opportunities for improved safety through reduction in personnel in the most hazardous coal cutting areas. In situ, real-time coal <b>seam</b> <b>measurements</b> using the Special Technologies Laboratory (STL) ground penetrating radar (GPR) technology were shown feasible by a demonstration in a Utah coal mine on April 21, 1994. This report describes the October 18, 1994 in situ GPR <b>measurements</b> of coal <b>seam</b> thickness at the US Bureau of Mines (USBM) robotic mining testing laboratory. In this report, {{an overview of the}} measurements at the USBM Laboratory is given. It is followed by a description of the technical aspects of the STL frequency modulated-continuous wave (FM-CW) GPR system. Section 4 provides {{a detailed description of the}} USBM Laboratory measurements and the conditions under which they were taken.

40|$|A {{welding head}} is under {{development}} with integrated sensory systems for robotic laser welding applications. Robotic laser welding requires sensory {{systems that are}} capable to accurately guide the welding head over a seam in three-dimensional space and provide information about the welding process {{as well as the}} quality of the welding result. In this paper the focus is on seam tracking. It is difficult to measure three-dimensional parameters of a ream during a robotic laser welding task, especially when sharp corners are present. The proposed sensory system is capable to provide the three dimensional parameters of a <b>seam</b> in one <b>measurement</b> and guide robots over sharp corners...|$|R
40|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} (GMAW) process {{is one of the}} most {{widespread}} welding processes used in industries for their excellent quality, reliability, productivity, and cost-effectiveness. To develop an automatic GMAW system, vision capability in the system is a necessary component supplying real-time information about weld pool and seam tracking. In this research work, an automatic seam tracking system is presented, where the automatic tracking of welding path and torch positioning are performed by a newly developed image acquisition system. The system aims to add a vision capability to the GMAW system. A CCD camera is configured with a welding torch to acquire real-time images. The acquired images are processed through newly developed software for real-time detection of welding seam location and characteristics. The software encapsulates the acquired image input facility, image filtering technique, strategy to measure the seam gap, strategy to position torch at the starting point of welding, user interface for automatic guide, and the strategy to correct the torch movements. The seam recognition accuracy was verified during several welding experiments on linear weld <b>seam.</b> Real-time <b>measurements</b> of the <b>seam</b> gap and the seam tracking have achieved a high accuracy...|$|R
40|$|An {{adaptive}} process control and seam tracking system for robotic laser welding with filler {{was developed and}} then evaluated for the butt welding of SS- 1147 mild steel sheets of thickness 2 mm. The system comprises a 3 kW Nd:YAG laser, an industrial robot and a laser camera for <b>seam</b> tracking and <b>measurement</b> of gap width. The gap width data are used to control welding speed and wire feed rate. Experiments were carried out to weld butt joints of SS- 1147 mild steel with gap widths varying between 0 - 0. 8 mm. The resultant weld geometry was evaluated to determine the operating range of the laser camera (measured gap width) for monitoring to result in acceptable welds. Godkänd; 2003; 20061215 (ysko...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAustenitic {{stainless}} steel of type X 6 CrNiNb 18 - 10 is a commonly used material for pipelines of power plants. The fatigue behavior of these components is often operationally determined by thermo-mechanical stresses. Welded joints {{are subjected to}} various geometries and micro structural inhomogeneities, which lead to complex stresses in the component. This {{is the reason for}} a reduced fatigue life, in contrast to material's life itself, is observed. A parametric finite element model is developed, to investigate the influence parameters. In order {{to take into account the}} non- uniform hardness distribution in the region of the weld <b>seam,</b> hardness <b>measurements</b> are the base for the consideration of a material mismatch in plastic behavior. The material parameters for the used Chaboche material model must be modified individually, depending on the mismatch. In addition, the consideration of imperfections of the welding geometry is an important factor, too. Using a local approach by using measured geometry-parameters of the weld seam, acceptable accordance between experimentally and numerically calculated fatigue lives can be gained. The observed phenomena in experimental investigations that fatigue failure occurs either at the base metal or at the weld toe (depending on the loading conditions) can be reproduced by numerical simulations. This knowledge is used to develop an approach for lifetime estimation...|$|R
40|$|The rapid {{crushing}} {{technique for}} {{the measurement of}} gas content of coal consists of accelerating the rate of gas desorption from coal by crushing. This technique allows the determination of gas content {{in the space of}} hours rather than days or weeks as required for the traditional slow desorption technique. The crushing technique is used particularly when gas content determinations are urgently required for mine safety purposes. The method is now routinely used in underground coal mines of NSW {{and to a lesser extent}} in QLD. Despite the rapidity and efficiency of this method, concerns have been raised upon the reliability of the method to deliver accurate results. E) (perience in Australia has shown that there is in fact some discrepancy in results between gas laboratories using the rapid crush technique. The development of rapid crushing techniques for <b>seam</b> gas content <b>measurements</b> in Australia and the main causes of variability in the gas content test results were investigated. The gas laboratories participating in the gas content testing were CSIRO Division of Coal and Energy, BHP Technical Services and GeoGas Ply. Ltd...|$|R
40|$|An {{outburst}} of coal and gas {{is a key}} safety risk in coal mining and a worldwide phenomenon. It {{could be described as}} sudden ejection of gas and coal from a coal face. In multiple-seam mining, a seam with less outburst proneness is often extracted first prior to extract overlying or underlying seams with high outburst risks in order to mitigate the risks. A large number of engineering practices show that this protective mining sequence, aided by pressure relief gas drainage, is quite effective. Gas pressure in coal seams is often measured and used to assess the de-gassing effect and define outburst-free zones in a degassed seam, often practiced in Chinese coal mines. However, this method has its shortfalls. Firstly, site <b>measurement</b> of <b>seam</b> gas pressure is quite time-consuming as it normally takes a few weeks to complete. Secondly, it can also be problematic due to damages to measurement boreholes and their sealing, resulting in inaccurate pressure readings. To address these issues associated with <b>seam</b> gas pressure <b>measurements,</b> gas content in coal was tried to replace gas pressure to define outburst-free zones in a degassed seam. The field trial was successfully implemented at the 1492 (1) panel mining # 11 - 2 coal seam in Pansan Mine, Huainan, China. The trial results showed that the gas content of the overlying # 13 - 1 seam was reduced from 8. 4 m 3 /t to about 2 - 4 m 3 /t following mining the # 11 - 2 seam, this was well below the outburst threshold value of 6 m 3 /t set for the 13 - 1 seam. The outburst risk of mining the # 13 - 1 seam in the area directly above the 1492 (1) panel was completely eliminated. The gas content measurements were carried out using the direct desorption method as described in the Australian Standard AS 3980 - 1999. The results also indicated that the de-outburst zone extended 12 m outside the panel return gateroad and 24 m outside the panel start line. It should be mentioned that the extent of the de-outburst zone is somewhat different from conventional understanding in China that the zone lies about 19 m inside the panel return gateroad and 30 m inside the panel start line under the panel condition while the others are 12 m outside the panel return and 24 m inside the panel start line. As the extent of the de-outburst zone is of fundamental importance in integrated coal production and methane extraction in multi-seam mining environment, more investigations are required to evaluate exact boundaries of de-outburst zones...|$|R
