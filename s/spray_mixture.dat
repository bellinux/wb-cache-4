50|$|One of {{the most}} common forms of {{pesticide}} application, especially in conventional agriculture, is the use of mechanical sprayers. Hydraulic sprayers consists of a tank, a pump, a lance (for single nozzles) or boom, and a nozzle (or multiple nozzles). Sprayers convert a pesticide formulation, often containing a mixture of water (or another liquid chemical carrier, such as fertilizer) and chemical, into droplets, which can be large rain-type drops or tiny almost-invisible particles. This conversion is accomplished by forcing the <b>spray</b> <b>mixture</b> through a spray nozzle under pressure. The size of droplets can be altered through the use of different nozzle sizes, or by altering the pressure under which it is forced, or a combination of both. Large droplets have the advantage of being less susceptible to spray drift, but require more water per unit of land covered. Due to static electricity, small droplets are able to maximize contact with a target organism, but very still wind conditions are required.|$|E

40|$|Droplet {{behaviour}} during impact affects retention by leaves. The {{increase of}} droplet adhesion to plant leaves is the objective when applying crop protection products, while droplet bouncing and fragmentation are usually seen as detrimental to spray retention. However, observation of droplet impacts on barley using high speed imaging showed that fragmentation impact outcome {{can occur in}} two different wetting regimes: Cassie-Baxter or Wenzel’s regime. In the latter, {{a fraction of the}} droplet is anchored in the surface roughness, what contributes to retention.

40|$|With greater {{environmental}} awareness, {{the movement}} of pesticides within and off of a spray target area is a critical public concern. Ideally, all of the material applied should be deposited within the targeted swath on the intended pest or plant. But realistically, {{a portion of the}} spray remains airborne and is carried downwind to non-target areas. Airborne spray leaving the targeted area reduces the applied dosage, and could cause damage to neighboring plant and water source or other detrimental environmental impacts. To study the influences of nozzle type, <b>spray</b> <b>mixture</b> and wind speed on spray drift, experiments were conducted using a wind tunnel. Spray drift risk was assessed by adding a tracer to the <b>spray</b> <b>mixture</b> and measuring the quantities of spray deposited downwind from the nozzle on horizontal polythene lines with 2 mm diameter perpendicular to the wind direction in a vertical and a horizontal array. At a distance of 2 m downwind from the static nozzle, five collector lines (V 1 to V 5) were positioned one above the other at the spacing of 0. 1 m to provide an estimate of the spray still airborne through this vertical profile. An additional five sampling collector strings (H 1 to H 5) were placed in a horizontal array with one-meter horizontal spacing at 0. 1 m height to determine the fallout volumes and gradients of the spray from 2 to 6 m downwind. A water-soluble fluorescent tracer was dissolved into tap water as the spray liquid, and after the experiments, the collecting lines were washed with deionized water to measure deposit and drift. The results indicated that deposits on sampling collector decreased with increased vertical elevation and horizontal distance. Average fallout and airborne deposit resulting from the different spray applications were shown in the paper. These figures showed the expected fallout and airborne profiles for all tested nozzle types and sizes. The highest fallout deposits were measured at a position closest to the nozzle (H 1) with a systematic decrease with the distance from the nozzle. The highest airborne deposits were found at the lowest sampling collector (V 1) with a systematic decrease with increasing height above the wind tunnel floor. Airborne spray drift was affected by wind speed. At all sample positions, deposits on collectors were reduced at lower wind speed. Nozzle 2 ̆ 7 s structure was also found to influence droplet 2 ̆ 7 s size, so injector/pre-orifice nozzle produced coarser droplets and reduced spray drift. The amount of spray recovered is based on the amount of active ingredient of <b>spray</b> <b>mixture</b> within each droplet rather than the total droplet volume. On that basis, a multiple non-linear model for statistical drift prediction including four independent, non-correlated variables (target distance, wind speed, nozzle type and chemical type) was established.

40|$|Losses of bees by {{poisoning}} {{have been}} greatly increased {{in recent years}} by the growing practice of applying insecticidal and fungicidal sprays to fruit trees. Preliminary laboratory tests showed that, of the common constituents of <b>spray</b> <b>mixtures,</b> only lead arsenate and flowers of sulphur were likely to cause serious honeybee poisoning, though Derris emulsion may cause slight poisoning. Syrup containing lime sulphur, nicotine sulphate, or copper sulphate was strongly repellent to the bees. It seemed possible that <b>spray</b> <b>mixtures</b> might be made repellent to the honeybee by the addition of suitable substances. Further trials showed that lead arsenate solution, at least in the concentrations normally used, was no more attractive to the bee than distilled water. Concentrations of 1 / 500 lime sulphur or 1 / 2000 nicotine sulphate were sufficient to reduce the uptake of M/ 1 sucrose to less than 10 % of that of unadulterated sucrose solution, and very much lower concentrations appreciably affected the uptake. The presence of lead arsenate in these solutions seemed to make them even more repellent. The repellent effect was reduced, though not entirely destroyed, when the solutions were evaporated to dryness and taken up in distilled water again. Creosote (0. 13 %), which has been suggested as a possible repellent, gave erratic results under laboratory conditions, and, in view of the danger of phytocidal action it is probably unwise to attempt to use its repellent property. Open flowers of apple trees were sprayed with various <b>spray</b> <b>mixtures</b> in an orchard experiment, and counts of bees showed both lime sulphur (1 %) and nicotine sulphate (0. 05 % nicotine) to have retained their repellent value for at least 7 days, in spite of heavy rain. If bees can thus be deterred from visiting the open blossom, {{it should be possible to}} deter them even more thoroughly from collection of water contaminated by sprays applied at the correct time. Data collected throughout the country during the last 3 years show calcium or lead arsenate to be the constituent of orchard sprays causing honeybee poisoning. Bees may collect arsenic when visiting fruit trees, or plants growing beneath or near the trees, for pollen or water, contaminated water apparently being the chief cause of poisoning; about 0. 00005 mg. internal arsenic per bee has been found to be a lethal dose. When arsenical sprays alone are applied to trees, particularly if to the open blossom as is sometimes the case with gooseberries and cherries, severe poisoning from the pollen may be expected. On the other hand, much of the danger from contaminated water should be removed by the incorporation of lime sulphur (1 % or more) or nicotine sulphate (0. 05 % nicotine) into sprays intended for application either before flowering or after petal fall, provided that alternative sources of water are available for foraging bees. Provision of water within the hive is suggested as a further safeguard...|$|R
40|$|Cacao (Theobroma cacao) is an {{important}} cash crop in tropical climates {{such as that of}} Latin America. Over the past several decades, the infection of cultivated cacao by Moniliophthora roreri, known commonly as “monilia”, has significantly hindered cacao production in Latin America. Studies have proposed the use of Trichoderma sp. Fungi in biocontrol treatments to prevent and reduce monilia infection, yet tests of Trichoderma-containing spray treatments on cacao agroforests have produced mixed results. Researchers and agricultural workers have suggested that addition of soil, fly ash, or other carbon sources to a Trichoderma spray may improve its efficacy in fighting monilia. To test these suggestions, we designed a series of <b>spray</b> <b>mixtures</b> including Trichoderma cultures, soil, and all necessary controls. We applied the <b>spray</b> <b>mixtures</b> to 80 cacao trees (20 trees for each of four resistant-selected clones to monilia) at the FINMAC organic cacao plantation in Pueblo Nuevo de Guacimo, Limón Province, in northeastern Costa Rica in March-April 2013. Five treatments were applied (control, water, water plus sterilized soil, water plus Trichoderma, and water plus sterilized soil plus Trichoderma). Each treatment was applied to four trees of each clone. We monitored the incidence of moniliainfection under each spray treatment over the course of 35 d. We found that spraying entire cacao trees two times with a mixture containing Trichoderma and sterilized soil significantly reduced the incidence of monilia infection by 11 % (p< 0. 05) in only 35 d, ascompared to the control. This reduction in loss of cacao pods translates into an increase of plantation mean productivity of 1 500 kg dried beans/ha by 198 kg/ha up to 1 698 kg/ha or by a total increase over the whole 110 ha plantation by 21 780 kg. We propose that using such an antifungal spray over the whole course of a crop cycle (120 days) would decrease infection incidence even more. Application of this fungal control measure has the potential of revitalizing the production of cacao in the region. Rev. Biol. Trop. 62 (3) : 899 - 907. Epub 2014 September 01...|$|R

Injection sprayers {{have the potential to}} decrease excess spray mixtures resulting from applications and improve operator safely by reducing handling of chemicals. ^ Peristaltic pumps are used to meter liquid chemical formulations on some current injection sprayers. Accuracies of two peristaltic pumps metering solution, emulsion and suspension liquid herbicide formulations were determined. The maximum error in the volumetric metering rate was 41 % for a three-roller pump and 111 % for a two-roller pump. To avoid exceeding a 5 % error criterion, the pumps need to be calibrated for the chemical and temperature used. ^ An experimental thermal flowmeter was developed and tested along with turbine and piston flowmeters. Flow rates of a solution and an emulsion herbicide formulation were measured successfully. The piston flowmeter had the best linearity and the smallest time constant. To avoid exceeding a 5 % error criterion, each flowmeter needs to be calibrated for the chemical and temperature used. Each flowmeter had difficulties measuring a suspension formulation. ^ Theoretical chemical application rates were derived for injection sprayers that provide constant <b>spray</b> <b>mixture</b> flow rates through the nozzles and a <b>spray</b> <b>mixture</b> concentration proportional to ground speed.

A pressurized tank generates the flow and a microprocessor-based system controls the position of a flow control valve, based on the flow rate indicated by a piston flowmeter. The chemical flow rate overshoot was 1. 46 mL/min following a transition from an acceleration of 1. 6 (km/h) /s to constant speed.

The {{increase of}} adhesion is usually {{seen as the}} objective when applying crop protection products, while bouncing and shattering are seen as detrimental to spray retention. However, observation of drop impacts on barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) using high speed shadowgraphy shows that bouncing and fragmentation can occur in Cassie-Baxter {{as well as in}} Wenzel wetting regimes. In this last regime, a part of the drop may remain stuck on the surface, contributing to retention. Using simultaneous measurements of drop impacts with high speed imaging and of retention with fluorophotometry for spray mixtures on excised barley leaves using a Teejet 11003 nozzle at 0. 2 MPa, it is observed that about 50 % of the drops that fragmented in the Wenzel state remain on the horizontal leaf.

Large differences in ionization efficiency were observed for mixtures of homopolyesters containing dipropoxylated bisphenol A/adipic acid and dipropoxylated bisphenol A/isophthalic acid and the corresponding copolyester dipropoxylated bisphenol A/isophthalic acid/adipic acid. The adipic acid structure has a higher affinity for the sodium cation, which results in more intense peaks for adipic acid containing oligomers. Relative sodium affinities of the oligomers were found to increase with {{an increasing number of}} acid end groups in favor of adipic acid containing oligomers. The ESI response of the oligomers depends on the polymer concentration in the <b>sprayed</b> <b>mixture.</b> This makes it impossible to correct for the ionization efficiency necessary for copolymer analysis. If differences in ionization efficiency are not corrected, the ion intensities in the copolymer mass spectra will show large deviations from the real composition and no conclusion can be drawn about the chemical (in) homogeneity of the MWD nor the random or block structure of the copolymer. This will also be valid for other cationization techniques like MALDI and FAB...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} data on {{a technical}} condition of cast iron crankshafts to be repaired which is characterized by wear of crankshaft necks and connecting rod journals and misalignment of crankshaft  necks of ZMZ- 53 -engines. Wear and misalignment of crankshaft necks are closely described by the the Weibull's law and 70 – 75 % of the shafts to be repaired require recovery with deposition of coating. In order to recover crankshaft necks it is proposed to apply plasma <b>spraying</b> with a <b>mixture</b> of powders which includes copper powder. Coating obtained {{in accordance with the}} proposed technology is characterized by wear intensity during its normal operation 4, 0 · 10 – 6 g/m, and it is by 3 – 5 % lower than the wear intensity rate of those shafts that have been recovered with the help of <b>spraying</b> powder <b>mixtures</b> without copper...|$|R
