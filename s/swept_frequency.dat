40|$|A new {{approach}} to generate high-quality broadband <b>frequency</b> <b>swept</b> millimeter-wave (mm-wave) waveforms based on photonics-assisted frequency up conversion of a low-frequency chirped drive signal has been proposed. This is made possible by using an unbalanced temporal pulse shaping system involving two cascaded Mach-Zehnder modulators both biased at the minimum transmission points. The proposed approach is verified by simulations. A <b>frequency</b> <b>swept</b> mm-wave pulse with its instantaneous frequency spanning from 40 to 100 GHz and a chirp rate of 66. 7 GHz/ns is generated thanks to 40 times frequency up conversion. Two-fold improvement on the time-bandwidth product of the generated waveform is also achieved thanks to the cascaded modulation scheme...|$|R

After compression, the resulting pulses will show some loss in amplitude, a time (range) shift and degradation in sidelobe performance. In a typical radar system, the Doppler frequency is {{a small fraction of}} the <b>swept</b> <b>frequency</b> range (i.e. the system bandwidth) of the chirp, so the range errors due to Doppler are found to be minor. For example, for fd<<B/2, the time shift is given by.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{compares the}} <b>swept</b> <b>{{frequency}}</b> (SFM) and low voltage impulse methods (LVI) for making frequency response analysis measurements. The principles of these measurements are explained. Practical {{examples of the}} application to a 30 MVA transformer with simulated mechanical and electrical faults are presented. For mechanical faults neither method is very successful, but this probably because the simulated fault was not severe enough. For electrical faults the <b>swept</b> <b>frequency</b> method gives better results {{because it has a}} finer resolution at low frequencies. In a final comparison of the two methods the <b>swept</b> <b>frequency</b> method is found to be superior in most respects, but the low voltage impulse method is found to have some important advantages. 1...|$|E

40|$|<b>Swept</b> <b>Frequency</b> Source Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) {{requires}} high {{repetition rate}} and wide spectral width wavelength tunable sources {{at a low}} cost. The sampled grating distributed Bragg reflector (SG-DBR) laser provides wide wavelength tuning range while exhibiting a wavelength switching speed that is among the fastest currently available. The SG-DBR laser is used to generate linear frequency ramps with high repetition rates. Since the SG-DBR laser is currently used for the telecommunications industry in high volume, {{the price of the}} system is much lower than current OCT sources. Therefore the SG-DBR laser provides a practical solution for Swept Source OCT. Four synchronized waveforms sent to the inputs of the laser control the linear frequency ramp. Three of the waveforms control the output frequency, while the fourth waveform controls the output amplifier of the laser to keep the output power stable. Two SG-DBR lasers with overlapping wavelength coverage are also concatenated to increase the bandwidth of the <b>swept</b> <b>frequency</b> source. The linear ramp stitching points in the frequency ramps are investigated and methods are outlined to reduce them. Finally, experimental OCT tests are performed using the <b>swept</b> <b>frequency</b> sources created to analyze the linearity of our sources. From these test results, an evaluation can be made on the specifications and capabilities of the <b>swept</b> <b>frequency</b> sources and analyze their value for OCT applications...|$|E

40|$|Conventionally, either <b>swept</b> <b>frequency</b> {{technique}} or {{a combination}} of <b>swept</b> <b>frequency</b> and geometric analysis is used to produce the experimental Lamb wave dispersion data. This paper proposes a novel method for constructing dispersion curves in solid plates using Fourier analysis of received leaky Lamb wave signals.

The relative distances among the plate and the two transducers are set to specific values as per geometric calculations based on beam diffraction. The transducer defocus is used in conjunction with geometric calculation to determine the phase velocity of the Lamb wave mode being monitored. Subsequent to appropriate positioning of the transducers, the plate wave signals are Fourier transformed to obtain a magnitude versus frequency spectrum. Peaks in the spectrum indicate the presence of a Lamb wave root. The feasibility of this method has been tested by successfully constructing a dispersion curve for a steel plate...|$|E

40|$|A cavity {{ringdown}} spectrometer, {{based on}} a continuous-wave swept-frequency laser, enables efficient, rapid recording of wide-ranging absorption spectra as characteristic spectral signatures of airborne molecules. The rapidly <b>swept</b> laser <b>frequency</b> resonates with the longitudinal modes of the ringdown cavity, effectively sampling the absorption spectrum of an intracavity gas at intervals defined by the cavity's free spectral range and generating a full absorption spectrum within a single rapid sweep of the widely tunable laser frequency. We report a new analog detection scheme that registers a single data point for each buildup and ringdown decay event without logging details of the full signal waveform; this minimizes demand on digitizer speed and memory depth, reducing the time scale of data processing.
