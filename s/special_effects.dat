40|$|Video Segmentation {{plays an}} {{integral}} role in many multimedia {{applications such as}} digital libraries, content management systems, and various other video browsing, indexing, and retrieval systems. Many algorithms for segmentation of video {{have appeared in the}} past few years. Most of these algorithms perform well on cuts, but yield poor performance on gradual transitions or <b>special</b> <b>effect</b> edits. A complete video segmentation system must achieve good performance on <b>special</b> <b>effect</b> edit detection also. In this paper, we discuss the performance of our VideoTrails based algorithms with other existing <b>special</b> <b>effect</b> edit detection algorithms in literature. Results from experiments testing for the ability to detect edits from TV programs ranging from commercials to news magazine programs, and also diverse <b>special</b> <b>effect</b> edits introduced by us have been shown...|$|R

Obayashi and the cameraman oversaw the <b>special</b> <b>effects</b> for the film. Obayashi desired the <b>special</b> <b>effects</b> to look unrealistic, as if a child created them. For the scene in which Ai Matsubara's character vanishes under the blood, Obayashi had her suspended nude, pouring buckets of blue paint on her to create a blue-screen chroma key effect where the blue colored parts of her body would deteriorate on camera. The outcome {{of a lot of}} these effects would be unknown until the film was completed. Obayashi stated that sometimes the effects did not turn out how he originally envisioned them.|$|E

3000|$|In summary, {{two kinds}} of {{influencing}} factors of super-high arch dam deformation (Y) exist: independent variables and <b>special</b> <b>effect.</b> The independent variables X_ 1, [...]...,X_p represent common influencing factors of deformation at all measuring points (hydraulic pressure, temperature, and aging), whereas <b>special</b> <b>effect</b> α_ 1, [...]...,α_i reflects deformation difference between different measuring points. Such <b>special</b> <b>effect</b> has two values, and the corresponding panel model has a fixed-effect model and random-effect model. In practical engineering, the panel model that conforms to deformation characteristics of the dam shall be chosen, which means that choosing the appropriate model according to the test results of the deformation monitoring sequences is necessary.|$|R

5|$|Alex Weldon {{was hired}} to be {{supervisor}} of <b>special</b> <b>effects</b> for the film. Weldon was planning on retiring after 42years of effects work, but his wife urged him to take on Star Trek because she thought {{he did not have}} enough to do. When Weldon was hired, many of the effects had already been started or completed by Rugg; it was up to Weldon to complete more complex and higher-budgeted effects for the motion picture. The first step of preparation involved analyzing the script in the number, duration, and type of effects. Before costs could be determined and Weldon could shop for necessary items, he and {{the other members of the}} <b>special</b> <b>effects</b> team worked out all possibilities for pulling off the effects in a convincing manner.|$|E
