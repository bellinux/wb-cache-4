5000|$|Based on the {{requirement}} to respond to specific standing tasks assigned to the CAF by the Government of Canada, such as respond to a terrorist attack, an international crisis or a CBRN threat, CANSOFCOM has developed several standing Special Operations Task Forces:• Immediate Response Task Force (IRTF). The IRTF is the highest readiness task force available to the Government of Canada; it is deployed on extremely short notice to address issues that could affect national interests. It is composed of personnel from all CANSOFCOM units and is led by JTF 2. Its primary focus is counter-terrorism operations, domestic or international. o Tasks include, {{but are not limited}} to: Hostage rescue, direct action, CBRN response, sensitive site exploitation, counter-proliferation, maritime special operations. • Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Task Force. This Task Force is based on the personnel and capabilities of CJIRU and includes the CANSOFCOM contribution to Canada’s National CBRNE Response Team, led by the RCMP. The CBRN Task Force provides a short notice response to crisis or major events within Canada and is primarily focused on counter-terrorism that involves Chemical, Biological, Radiological and/or Nuclear elements. It provides technical response to CBRN incidents and can be enabled by the capabilities of other CANSOFCOM units as required. At the request of the Government of Canada, the CBRN Task Force can also conduct counter-proliferation operations and be deployed internationally. o Tasks include, but are not limited to: Reconnaissance, surveillance, sampling, limited decontamination for Task Force personnel and sensitive site exploitation. • Task Force Arrowhead. TF Arrowhead is a <b>scaleable,</b> agile force able to respond to threats and incidents around the globe on short notice. While it is internationally focused, it can also be deployed in Canada. It is a high readiness SOTF capable of quickly deploying to a crisis for short periods of time. It is composed of personnel from all four units in the Command and is led by CSOR. TF Arrowhead represents an initial response that could be a pre-cursor to the deployment of another SOTF or conventional task force. o Tasks include, but are not limited to: Direct action, CBRN response, sensitive site exploitation, counter-proliferation, support to non-combatant evacuation operations, special protection operations. • SOF Teams. Small teams of CANSOFCOM personnel perform tasks that fall outside the scope of the three standing task forces. SOF teams generally deploy for short periods of time, typically not longer than six months. SOF teams are made up of personnel and capabilities from all four units. o Tasks include, but are not limited to: Defence, diplomacy and military assistance, strategic advice, planning and liaison, strategic reconnaissance and security support to operations of other Government of Canada organizations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A novel rapid {{power-on}} {{operational amplifier}} and a current modulation technique {{are used in}} a 10 -bit 1. 5 -bit/stage pipelined ADC in 0. 18 - m CMOS to realize power scalability between 1 kS/s (15 W) and 50 MS/s (35 mW), while maintaining an SNDR of 54 – 56 dB for all sampling rates. The current modulated power scaling (CMPS) technique is shown to enhance the power <b>scaleable</b> range of current scaling by 50 times, allowing ADC power to be varied {{by a factor of}} 2500 while only varying bias currents by a factor of 50. Furthermore, the nominal power is reduced by 20 %– 30 % by completely powering off the rapid power-on opamps during the sampling phase in the pipeline’s sample-and-holds.

40|$|Construction {{operations}} are often repetitive {{not only in}} terms of time (the same tasks are performed over and over) but also in tenns of space (the same tasks are repeated at several places, such as different floors in a high-rise building). Thus, construction simulation models in general must be cyclic to represent temporal repetitions, but also <b>scaleable</b> to represent spatial repetitions. This paper presents the mechanisms for preprocessor replacement and automatic code generation that have been designed and implemented to facilitate the development of <b>scaleable</b> simulation models in STROBOSCOPE, a general-purpose discrete-event simulation system developed by the authors. A relatively complex simulation model for the vertical transportation of people serves as an example to illustrate how to develop a completely <b>scaleable</b> model for the operation of an elevator in a building with any number of floors. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the need for}} the higher education sector to develop and implement <b>scaleable,</b> quantitative measures that evaluate community and establish organisational benchmarks in order to guide the development of future practices designed to enhance the student learning experience. Design/methodology/approach – Literature regarding contemporary Australian higher education policy and community development is critiqued to illustrate the need for universities to adopt <b>scaleable</b> quantitative measures to evaluate stated strategic imperatives and establish organisational benchmarks. The integration of organisational benchmarks guides the implementation of future practices designed to enhance the student learning experience. A current active exemplar methodology is discussed to demonstrate applicability to both higher education administrators and teaching staff across the various organisation levels. Findings – While universities are promoting and investing in the concept of community to enhance the student learning experience there are as yet, limited <b>scaleable</b> evaluative measures and performance indicators to guide practitioners. This paper proposes an effective measurement tool to benchmark current pedagogical performance standards and monitor the progress and achievement of future implemented practices designed to enhance the sense of community experienced by the student cohort. Originality/value – This paper identifies and addresses the current absence of effective <b>scaleable</b> evaluative measures to assess the achievement of stated strategic imperatives implemented as a consequence of reducing government financial support, increasing accountability, and increasing student expectations as result of educational consumerism...|$|E
