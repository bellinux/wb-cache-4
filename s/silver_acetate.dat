40|$|Background: Colloidal silver {{has been}} used as an {{antibiotic}} for at least 100 years. (1) Patients with rheumatoid arthritis may produce antibodies to both Proteus bacteria and to proteins containing citrullinyl residues. Proteus are enterobacteria also found in the upper urinary tract (notably in females),that are able to transform protein-arginyl residues to antigenic protein-citrullinyl residues. Methods: Anti-arthritic activity was evaluated after orally administering colloidal metallic silver (CMS) to female Wistar rats developing chronic polyarthritis after tailbase injection of either (i) a complete Freund’s adjuvant or (ii) collagen type-II emulsified with an incomplete Freund’s adjuvant or (iii) pristane. Anti-proteus activity was determined by disc diffusion assay by growing P. vulgaris and P. mirabilis on agar plates in the presence of various CMS preparations. Results: A. CMS preparations made electrolytically and administered orally (on alternate days for two weeks) were powerful anti-arthritic agents in rats (ED 80 approx. 85 microgm/kg total silver). Monovalent <b>silver</b> preparations (<b>acetate,</b> nitrate, oxide) were ineffective at twice this dose. B. CMS preparations were also more potent than silver salts in suppressing growth of Proteus sp. in vitro. Against P. mirabilis, minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of total silver were greater than 50 nanogm/ml for chemically prepared CMS and less than 6 nanogm/ml for electrolytically prepared CMS: the difference being due to the smaller size of nanoparticles and different Zeta potentials in electrolytic preparations, compared with chemical preparations, of CMS. Conclusions: Pro-arthritic gut micro-organisms may be susceptible to ‘old’ antibiotics taken orally such as colloidal silver, as well as to accepted slow-acting anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) originally developed as antibiotics eg minocycline, dapsone, and salazopyrine. However before CMS can be accepted as a pharmaceutical adjunct, more rigorous Quality Controls must be developed for its preparation and physicochemical characterisation – as well as antimicrobial efficacies and general safety.

40|$|Abstract: Simple, accurate, {{sensitive}} and selective methods are described for the quantitative determination of ten fluoroquinolones (amifloxacin, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, difloxacin hydrochloride, enoxacin, enrofloxacin, lomefloxacin hydrochloride, levofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin and pefloxacin mesylate). The methods {{are based on}} precipitation of the ion associates formed from {{the reaction of the}} cited drugs with <b>silver</b> nitrate, copper <b>acetate</b> and ferric chloride. The formation and solubility of the solid complexes at the optimum conditions of pH and ionic strength values have been studied. The methods depend on direct determination of the ions in the precipitate or indirect determination of the ions in the filtrate by atomic absorption spectroscopy. The optimum conditions for precipitation were carefully studied. Rectilinear calibration graphs were obtained in the range of 10 - 100 ng. ml- 1 for each of the investigated drugs and the limits of detection and quantitation ranged from 1. 125 to 2. 260, o. 937 to 2. 754 and from 3. 425 to 5. 986 ng. ml- 1, respectively. The molar ratios of the formed chelats were determined by Job's method and their association constants were also calculated. The developed methods were applied successfully for the determination of the studied drugs in their pharmaceutical dosage forms with good precision and accuracy compared to official and reported methods as revealed by t-and F-tests. They were also applied for the determination of studied drugs in spiked urine and plasma samples...|$|R

40|$|The dinuclear cyclometallated gold(I) complex [Au 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] was {{prepared}} in high yield from {{the reaction of}} 2 -LiC 6 F 4 PPh 2 with either [AuBr(AsPh 3) ] or [AuCl(tht) ], and from the reaction of 2 -Me 3 SnC 6 F 4 PPh 2 with [AuCl(tht) ]. The digold(I) complex undergoes oxidative addition reactions with halogens to give the metal-metal bonded dihalodigold(II) complexes [Au 2 IIX 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] (X = Cl, Br, I), which on warming or exposure to light, isomerise to give the heterovalent gold(I) -gold(III) species [XAu(µ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) (κ 2 - 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) AuX] containing a four-membered cyclometallated ring on a gold(III) centre. Unlike its protio analogue, [Au 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] did not undergo oxidative addition of methyl iodide or dibenzoyl peroxide. The dihalodigold(II) [Au 2 IIX 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] and gold(I) -gold(III) compounds [XAu(µ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) (κ 2 - 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) AuX] (X = Cl, Br) are further oxidised by halogens to give the digold(III) species [Au 2 X 4 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] and [X 3 Au(μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) (κ 2 - 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) AuX], respectively. The complexes [Au 2 X 4 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] are reduced to the dihalodigold(II) complexes {{in the presence of}} one equivalent of zinc powder; further addition of zinc gave the parent digold(I) dimer. Treatment of [Au 2 IICl 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] and [ClAu(µ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) (κ 2 - 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) AuCl] with an excess of <b>silver</b> nitrate, benzoate, <b>acetate,</b> trifluoroacetate or triflate gave the corresponding oxyanion complexes. Slow crystallisation of the di(benzoato) digold(II) complex from dichloromethane and methanol gave the parent digold(I) complex derived by reductive elimination. The di(triflato) digold(II) complex behaved similarly, although in this case the novel gold(I) tetramer [Au 4 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 4] was formed together with the dimer. Two closely related gold complexes containing the chelating κ 2 (C,O) phosphine oxide ligand, 2 -C 6 F 4 P(O) PPh 2, were isolated from the reaction of [ClAu(µ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) (κ 2 - 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) AuCl] with an excess of silver nitrate. The reaction of [Au 2 IICl 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] with two equivalents of potassium trifluoroethoxide failed to give the corresponding digold(II) bis(alkoxo) complex; instead, reduction took place to form the digold(I) dimer [Au 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2]. Treatment of a solution of the di(benzoato) digold(II) complex with C 6 F 5 Li gave the pentafluorophenyl complex [Au 2 (C 6 F 5) 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] which, when heated in toluene, rearranged to the gold(I) -gold(III) complex [(C 6 F 5) Au(µ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) (κ 2 - 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) Au(C 6 F 5) ], analogous to the behaviour of the dihalodigold(II) complexes. The heterovalent, gold(I) -gold(III) dimethyl compound [Au 2 I,III(CH 3) 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2) 2] was obtained from the reaction of the di(benzoato) digold(II) complex with dimethylzinc. This compound is structurally similar to its tetraprotio analogue. The cycloaurated dinuclear gold complexes [Au 2 (μ-C 6 H 3 -n-F- 2 -PPh 2) 2] (n = 5, 6) were made similarly to the 2 -C 6 F 4 PPh 2 analogue from the appropriate lithium or tin reagents, though in some cases the dimers were formed in admixture with the corresponding gold(I) tetramers. Like their tetrafluoro analogues, the 6 -fluoro complexes [Au 2 X 2 (μ-C 6 H 3 - 6 -F- 2 -PPh 2) 2] (X = Cl, Br, I) rearrange on heating to give the heterovalent gold(I) -gold(III) species [XAu(µ-C 6 H 3 - 6 -F- 2 -PPh 2) (κ 2 -C 6 H 3 - 6 -F- 2 -PPh 2) AuX]. Thus, the presence of a fluorine atom in place of hydrogen in the 6 -position of the bridging aryl group is sufficient to stop the isomerisation of the digold(II) complexes [Au 2 X 2 (μ- 2 -C 6 H 4 PPh 2) 2] at the gold(I) -gold(III) stage and to prevent subsequent C-C coupling of the aryl groups at the gold(III) centre. In contrast, the dihalodigold(II) complexes containing the 5 -fluoro substituted ligand undergo reductive elimination and coupling of the metallated aryl groups to give the digold(I) biphenyldiyl complexes [Au 2 X 2 (2, 2 &# 039;-Ph 2 P- 5 -FC 6 H 3 C 6 H 3 - 5 -F-PPh 2) ] (X = Cl, Br, I). The described complexes were characterised using 1 H NMR, 31 P NMR, 19 F NMR spectroscopy, elemental analysis, mass spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and 197 Au Mössbauer spectroscopy...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Silver</b> <b>acetate</b> {{produces}} an unpleasant taste {{when combined with}} cigarettes, thereby producing an aversive stimulus. It has been marketed in various forms {{with the aim of}} extinguishing the urge to smoke, by pairing the urge with an unpleasant stimulus. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this review was to determine the effectiveness of <b>silver</b> <b>acetate</b> products (gum, lozenge, spray) in promoting smoking cessation. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group specialised trials register. Most recent search was in July 2012. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised trials of <b>silver</b> <b>acetate</b> for smoking cessation with reports of smoking status at least six months after the beginning of treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We extracted data in duplicate on the type of subjects, the dose and form of <b>silver</b> <b>acetate,</b> the outcome measures, method of randomisation, and completeness of follow-up. The main outcome measure was biochemically validated abstinence from smoking after at least six months follow-up in patients smoking at baseline. Subjects lost to follow-up were counted as continuing smokers. Where appropriate, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed effects model. MAIN RESULTS: Two studies provided long-term follow-up data on patients randomised to <b>silver</b> <b>acetate</b> or placebo. In one of these studies, there was a third arm, randomised to 2 mg nicotine gum. The pooled risk ratio for quitting for <b>silver</b> <b>acetate</b> vs placebo was 1. 04 (95 % confidence interval 0. 69 to 1. 57). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Existing trials show little evidence for a specific effect of <b>silver</b> <b>acetate</b> in promoting smoking cessation. The confidence intervals for the ratio are quite wide. However, the upper limit of the confidence intervals for a positive effect equates to an absolute increase in the smoking cessation rate of about 4 %. Any effect of this agent is therefore likely to be smaller than nicotine replacement therapy. The lack of effect of <b>silver</b> <b>acetate</b> may reflect poor compliance with a treatment whose rationale is to create an unpleasant stimulus...|$|E
