This high reflectivity is desirable in space-based UV spectrometers, which have reduced mirror sizes due to <b>space</b> <b>limitations.</b> Osmium-coated mirrors were flown in several space missions aboard the Space Shuttle, but {{it soon became clear}} that the oxygen radicals in the low Earth orbit are abundant enough to significantly deteriorate the osmium layer.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{set their}} next major attempt to {{recapture}} Henderson Field for 20 October and moved {{most of the}} 2nd and 38th infantry divisions, totalling 17,500 troops, from the Dutch East Indies to Rabaul in preparation for delivering them to Guadalcanal. From 14 September to 9 October, numerous Tokyo Express runs delivered troops from the Japanese 2nd Infantry Division as well as Hyakutake to Guadalcanal. In addition to cruisers and destroyers, some of these runs included the seaplane carrier , which delivered heavy equipment to the island including vehicles and heavy artillery other warships could not carry because of <b>space</b> <b>limitations.</b> The Japanese Navy promised to support the Army's planned offensive by delivering the necessary troops, equipment, and supplies to the island, and by stepping up air attacks on Henderson Field and sending warships to bombard the airfield.|$|E
5|$|Precautions {{were taken}} to prevent secrets from the season finale being revealed; only certain staff members were {{provided}} with copies of the episode, which were given on watermarked DVDs and distributed to secret hiding places. The writers wanted Michael {{to have a big}} plan to get Holly back, but to realize throughout {{the course of the day}} that his relationship with Holly was something special and that he did not want to disrupt it; they felt it showed that Michael had become more mature, calm and confident about this relationship than that of Jan Levinson and others in his past. The first scene with Michael and Holly discussing their sketch possibilities in a secluded area was filmed with three cameras: one focusing on each side of the two actors, and one from the front of both of them to establish that the picnic was still going on behind them. Due to <b>space</b> <b>limitations,</b> the latter angle was filmed through a mirror (with the actors appearing to be opposite sides) and then the image was reversed and undistorted in post-production.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{increased}} hardware capabilities, the team were able to increase both the content and graphical quality. With the aim of encouraging new players to buy the game, the overall difficulty was reduced compared to previous entries. After the unconventional gameplay of Gaiden, Mystery of the Emblem returned to the traditional gameplay used for Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light, in addition to continuing the story of Marth after focusing on different characters for Gaiden. Mystery of the Emblem was initially only going to include original story content, but after consideration, {{it was decided to}} include an upgraded version of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light for those who had not played the original. Another proposed plan was to split the release into two parts: a remake of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light and Mystery of the Emblem. Due to <b>space</b> <b>limitations,</b> some characters featured in the original version of Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light needed to be cut. The romance between Marth and Caeda was introduced as a refined version of a similar plot featured in Gaiden. As with previous games set in Archanea, the series' titular Fire Emblem took the form of a shield inset with five magical gems. According to Kaga, Mystery of the Emblem was intended as the last major title to be set on the continent of Archanea.|$|E
5|$|Secret of Mana was {{originally}} {{planned to be}} a launch title for the SNES-CD add-on. After the contract between Nintendo and Sony to produce the add-on failed, and Sony repurposed its work on the SNES-CD into the competing PlayStation console, Square adapted the game for the SNES cartridge format. The game had to be altered to fit the storage space of a SNES game cartridge, which is much smaller {{than that of a}} CD-ROM. The developers initially resisted continuing the project without the CD add-on, believing that too much of the game would have to be cut, but they were overruled by company management. As a result of the hardware change, several features had to be cut from the game, and some completed work needed to be redone. One of the most significant changes was the removal of the option to take multiple routes through the game that led to several possible endings, in contrast to the linear journey in the final product. The plot that remained was different than the original conception, and Tanaka has said that the original story had a much darker tone. Ishii has estimated that up to forty percent of the planned game was dropped to meet the <b>space</b> <b>limitations,</b> and critics have suggested that the hardware change led to technical problems when too much happens at once in the game. In 2006, Level magazine claimed that Secret of Manas rocky development was Square's main inspiration to move their games, such as the Final Fantasy series, from Nintendo consoles to Sony consoles in 1996.|$|E

25|$|Antagonists of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the AR {{have been}} {{proposed}} to overcome the limitations of current antiandrogens regarding mutant ARs, by directly blocking AR function from protein surface, outside of the LBP.

KMG created a 1,170-square-metre plaza around the tower by setting {{the front of the}} {{building}} 31 m back from the street and setting other sides back to allow wide pedestrian walkways. Inspectors from National Taiwan University were consulted to help ensure the building's stability in earthquakes. The design featured an observatory level at the 46th floor. Separate elevators were installed to serve department store customers, office workers, and visitors to the observatory. Mindful of Taiwan's typhoons and tropical sun, designers used aluminium for the exterior so it would weather well. The rose colour chosen for the exterior was inspired by the national flowers of Taiwan and Japan, the plum blossom and cherry blossom.|$|E

25|$|In the Tiberian masoretic codices, {{the unique}} system of cantillation for Sifrei Emet is complemented by a scribal layout {{unlike that of}} the rest of the Bible: Instead of the three narrow columns per page typical of these codices, Sifrei Emet are written in two wide columns per page. In each line of these wide columns text begins on the right, {{followed}} by a gap, and then continued by further text until the left margin of the column. Although there is ample evidence that the scribes attempted to place the gaps in the middle of the lines at the points where the cantillation divides the verses, they often did not succeed in doing so because of <b>space</b> <b>limitations.</b> Modern editions based upon the Aleppo Codex have implemented the idea fully by allowing wide full-page columns for Psalms, Proverbs, and Job.|$|E
25|$|These {{considerations}} {{resulted in}} a reluctance to abandon fuselage-mounted guns altogether. The question was exactly where to mount additional guns. With few exceptions, severe <b>space</b> <b>limitations</b> made the mounting {{of more than two}} synchronized guns in the forward fuselage highly problematic. The option of adding a third weapon firing through a hollow propeller shaft (an old idea, dating, like synchronization, from a Schneider patent of 1913) was only applicable to fighters with geared in-line engines, and even for them added only a single weapon. Although most Soviet fighters made do with slow firing synchronized cannon, most designers of piston-engined fighters found that any worthwhile increase in firepower had to include at least some guns mounted in the fighter's wings, and that the firepower offered by synchronized weapons came to represent a decreasing percentage of a fighter's total armament.|$|E
25|$|As fifth {{generation}} games {{became more}} complex in content, sound and graphics, games began {{to exceed the}} limits of cartridge storage capacity. Nintendo 64 cartridges had a maximum of 64MB of data, whereas CDs held 650MB.

Due to the cartridge's <b>space</b> <b>limitations,</b> full motion video was not usually feasible for use in cutscenes. When it was present, it was heavily compressed to fit on the cartridge and usually of very brief length.
