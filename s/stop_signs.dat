The road heads slightly west south of Blythwood Road, then crosses Blythwood Ravine, which contains the small Burke Brook. After climbing into Lawrence Park, the road meets Lawrence Avenue East. This intersection, featuring a multi-stage traffic light, directs driver to the east before continuing north. From here to the northern terminus, it is classified as a collector road and is a wide residential street with several <b>stop</b> <b>signs.</b> The road ends {{near the edge of}} the West Don Valley at an intersection with Glen Echo Drive, adjacent to the Doncliffe Bus Loop.|$|E

25|$|<b>Stop</b> <b>signs</b> {{are often}} used in North America to control {{conflicting}} traffic movements at intersections that are not busy enough to justify the installation of a traffic signal or roundabout. In the United States, the stop sign is not intended {{for use as a}} traffic calming device; it is intended to be installed mainly for safety and/or to assign right-of-way for a certain direction. Nevertheless, in the United States, Mexico and Canada, <b>stop</b> <b>signs</b> are commonly deployed as supposed safety measures in residential areas and near places where children play or walk (such as schoolyards), or that experience frequent automobile collisions, making extra precautions necessary. <b>Stop</b> <b>signs</b> may be erected on all intersecting roads, resulting in three- and four-way stops. However, studies have confirmed that <b>stop</b> <b>signs</b> do not offer measurable safety benefits over the Yield approach adopted in the countries listed above based on original European research dating back many decades.|$|E

Even the smallest adjustment in a question, such as the article preceding the supposed memory, could alter the responses. For example, having asked someone if they'd seen [...] "the" [...] <b>stop</b> <b>sign,</b> rather than [...] "a" [...] <b>stop</b> <b>sign,</b> provided the respondent with a presupposition {{that there was a}} <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> in the scene. This presupposition increased the number of people responding that they had indeed seen the <b>stop</b> <b>sign.</b>|$|R

25|$|<b>Stop</b> <b>signs</b> {{are used}} globally. However, most {{countries}} see fewer {{of them than}} North America and South Africa, because all-way stops are never used and may even be legally prohibited. In a majority of European and Central Asian countries, as well as Cuba in North America, junctions without traffic lights or roundabouts are controlled by <b>stop</b> <b>signs</b> on minor roads and by white, yellow and black priority diamond signs on the major road. In the UK, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, New Zealand and Australia, <b>stop</b> <b>signs</b> are restricted to situations wherein coming to a dead stop is actually necessary because of severely limited sight lines. At {{the vast majority of}} minor intersections in these countries Give Way signs and/or equivalent road markings are used. Finally, at the busier crossing streets, Give Way signs may be replaced by (mini) roundabouts, which also work on the give way (rather than stop) principle.|$|E
40|$|A {{computer}} based choice reaction time task {{was used to}} investigate the knowledge and the association strength of n= 57 participants {{with regard to the}} St. Andrew’s cross. Within three conditions, it was compared to the <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> and a combination <b>sign</b> (<b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> + St. Andrew’s cross) as second and third target sign. Participants had to react as fast and correctly as possible to three series of traffic signs that were presented to them on a computer screen. In each of three conditions, participants showed significantly more incorrect judgments with regard to the meaning of the St. Andrew’s cross compared to the <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> as well as the combination sign. With regard to the choice reaction time, participants reacted significantly slower to the St Andrews cross compared to the <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> and the combination sign {{in the second and third}} condition. The retrieval of the correct schemata in case of the St. Andrew’s cross appeared to be more difficult than in the case of the <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> and the combination sign. These results support the use of the <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> at passive railway level crossings in addition to the St. Andrew’s cross...|$|R
2500|$|A {{pivoting}} arm {{equipped with}} a <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> {{is a piece of}} equipment required by law on North American school buses. The sign normally stows flat {{on the left side of}} the bus, and is deployed by the driver while picking up or dropping off passengers. Some buses have two such stop arms, one near the front facing forwards, and one near the rear facing backwards. The <b>stop</b> <b>sign</b> is retroreflective and equipped either with red blinking lights above and below the [...] legend, or with a [...] legend that is illuminated by LEDs. Unlike a normal <b>stop</b> <b>sign,</b> this sign requires other vehicles travelling in both directions to remain <b>stopped</b> until the <b>sign</b> is retracted.|$|R

25|$|Laws and {{regulations}} regarding how drivers {{must comply with}} a stop sign vary by jurisdiction. In the United States and Canada, these rules are set and enforced at the state or provincial level. At a junction where two or more traffic directions are controlled by <b>stop</b> <b>signs,</b> generally the driver who arrives and stops first continues first. If two or three drivers in different directions stop simultaneously at a junction controlled by <b>stop</b> <b>signs,</b> generally the drivers on the left must yield the right-of-way to the driver on the far right.|$|E

25|$|At {{junctions}} with <b>stop</b> <b>signs</b> or traffic lights, {{the most}} serious accidents are right-angle, left-turn or head-on collisions where vehicles move fast and collide at high impact angles, e.g. head-on. Roundabouts virtually eliminate those types of crashes. Instead, most crashes are glancing blows at low angles of impact.|$|E
25|$|A {{stop sign}} is a traffic sign, usually erected at road {{junctions}} {{such as a}} four-way intersection, that instructs drivers to stop and then to proceed only if the way ahead is clear. The idea of placing <b>stop</b> <b>signs</b> at road junctions was first conceived in 1890 when William Phelps Eno of Saugatuck, Connecticut proposed and devised {{the first set of}} traffic laws in an article published in Rider and Driver. However, the first use of <b>stop</b> <b>signs</b> did not appear until 1915 when officials in Detroit, Michigan installed a stop sign with black letters on a white background. Throughout the years and with many alterations made to the stop sign, the current version with white block-lettering on a red background that is used in the United States as well as emulated in many other countries around the world today, did not come into use until the Joint Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices adopted the design in 1975.|$|E
