5|$|Big Thunder <b>Ski</b> Jumping Centre was a twin <b>ski</b> jumping hill {{located in}} Thunder Bay in Northwestern Ontario, Canada. It {{constitutes}} part of Big Thunder National Training Centre. The first hills were built by Knute and Thor Hansen and opened in 1963. They were originally known as Lille Norway <b>Ski</b> Area, then Mt. Norway <b>Ski</b> Area, and Sundance Northwest Resort {{before taking the}} current name. The large and normal hills were built in 1974 and the venue {{was taken over by}} the provincial government in 1985. The hills hosted 29 FIS <b>Ski</b> Jumping World Cup and 50 Canadian <b>Ski</b> Jumping Championships tournaments between 1975 and 1995, climaxing with the FIS Nordic World <b>Ski</b> Championships 1995. Funding was then cut and the venue has since been closed and unmaintained.|$|E

50|$|Grass <b>skiing,</b> <b>skiing</b> on grass, is {{a method}} for {{training}} for alpine <b>skiing.</b> Both grass <b>skiing</b> and alpine <b>skiing</b> have become established as sports in their own right. The <b>skis</b> used for grass <b>skiing</b> are short with rolling treads or wheels. These <b>skis</b> {{are attached to the}} skiers' boots. Depending on the skill of the grass skier, high speeds and jumps can be navigated.|$|R

5|$|Events {{under the}} <b>Ski</b> Flying World Cup have several {{differences}} to the <b>Ski</b> Flying World Championships. The latter is an isolated tournament, or one-off event, {{in the same}} vein as the <b>Ski</b> Jumping World Championships and Winter Olympics, whereas the <b>Ski</b> Flying World Cup is part of the overall <b>Ski</b> Jumping World Cup season, and uses the same points system. These points contribute towards both <b>Ski</b> Flying and <b>Ski</b> Jumping World Cup standings; the former being effectively a 'mini season' within the latter. However, a feature shared with the <b>Ski</b> Flying World Championships is that the starting order switches over from the <b>Ski</b> Jumping World Cup standings to the <b>Ski</b> Flying World Cup standings after the first competition of the latter, and remains that way for all subsequent events.|$|E
5|$|La Praz {{received}} its first <b>ski</b> jumping hill in 1944. Ahead of the 1992 Winter Olympics, {{the large and}} normal hills were built along with a cross-country stadium to host <b>ski</b> jumping and Nordic combined events. Since 1997, the hill has hosted an annual summer FIS <b>Ski</b> Jumping Grand Prix event. It has also been used for one FIS <b>Ski</b> Jumping World Cup and two FIS Nordic Combined World Cup rounds, in addition to four events of the FIS <b>Ski</b> Jumping Continental Cup. The medium hill opened in 2004 and the small hill in 2008.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ski</b> flying events {{outside of}} the World Championships are a regular feature on the <b>Ski</b> Jumping World Cup calendar, usually {{occurring}} on two or three hills only. Because athletes almost always participate in both disciplines, points scored in <b>ski</b> flying also count towards the <b>Ski</b> Jumping World Cup standings. From 1991 to 2001, and from 2009 onwards, an additional title and trophy – the <b>Ski</b> Flying World Cup – has been awarded {{at the end of}} each season to the overall points winner of solely <b>ski</b> flying competitions, even if only one took place. In contrast to the <b>Ski</b> Flying World Championships, the <b>Ski</b> Flying World Cup is contested as a season. The former can be considered equivalent to the <b>Ski</b> Jumping World Championships, in that both are tournaments staged during the <b>Ski</b> Jumping World Cup season, but are isolated from it; therefore, points from neither are included as part of the World Cup standings.|$|E

5|$|<b>Ski</b> wax {{enhances the}} ability of a <b>ski</b> or other runner to slide over snow, which depends on both the {{properties}} of the snow and the <b>ski</b> to result in an optimum amount of lubrication from melting the snow by friction with the ski—too little and the <b>ski</b> interacts with solid snow crystals, too much and capillary attraction of meltwater retards the <b>ski.</b> Before a <b>ski</b> can slide, it must overcome the maximum value static friction. Kinetic (or dynamic) friction occurs when the <b>ski</b> is moving over the snow.|$|E
5|$|Skiing {{associations}} subsequently {{contend that}} {{veterans of the}} 10th Mountain Division had a substantial effect in the post-World War II development of skiing as a vacation industry and major sport. Ex-soldiers from the 10th laid out <b>ski</b> hills, designed <b>ski</b> lifts, became <b>ski</b> coaches, racers, instructors, patrollers, shop owners, and filmmakers. They wrote and published <b>ski</b> magazines, opened <b>ski</b> schools, improved <b>ski</b> equipment, and developed <b>ski</b> resorts. Up to 2,000 of the division's troops were involved in skiing-related professions after the war, and at least 60 <b>ski</b> resorts were founded by men of the division.|$|E

5|$|A {{challenger}} to Planica {{arrived in}} 1949 {{with the construction}} of Heini-Klopfer-Skiflugschanze ("Heini Klopfer <b>ski</b> flying hill") in Oberstdorf, West Germany. Designed by former <b>ski</b> jumper turned architect Heini Klopfer, as well as then-active <b>ski</b> jumpers Toni Brutscher and Sepp Weiler, the hill had a K-point of 120m to match that of Bloudkova velikanka. The FIS, still wary of the rising popularity of <b>ski</b> flying and wanting to keep it in check, refused to sanction the construction of the hill, having previously denounced the 1947 and 1948 events in Planica.|$|E
5|$|A small {{downhill}} <b>ski</b> area provided recreation for {{personnel and}} their dependents, {{operating on the}} base from the early 1960s until Loring's closure in 1994. This <b>ski</b> chalet also included a lighted skating rink and {{could be used to}} host events in the area.

5|$|After {{arriving}} in Revelstoke, Nelsen {{was instrumental in}} the establishment of Revelstoke <b>Ski</b> Club and the Big Hill located within Mount Revelstoke National Park. In 1927, he helped establish a <b>ski</b> jump in Grouse Mountain in North Vancouver. After his accident, he started working to establish Field <b>Ski</b> Club in Field, British Columbia, where he spent time between trains. He promoted a strict adherence to the amateur code, and stated that debates regarding professionalism were disruptive for the United States National <b>Ski</b> Association.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the more}} {{original}} castings was Anette Sagen, the world's leading female <b>ski</b> jumper, {{in her first}} film role. Sagen, 22 at the time, played the part of 70-year-old Owe's <b>ski</b> jumping mother, although in a younger incarnation. Hamer had already considered Sagen for the role, when he ran into her by chance at the Holmenkollen <b>Ski</b> Museum. Without knowing to whom he was talking, Hamer mentioned that he was shooting a film in this location, and was planning to ask Anette Sagen to be in it. The reason the theme of <b>ski</b> jumping was chosen was that Hamer's own mother performed the sport, and the film {{has been described as}} a tribute to all female <b>ski</b> jumpers. Sagen herself had also earlier been involved in a controversy over women's access to professional venues and competitions. Incidentally, Sagen and Owe are also both from the Norwegian town of Mosjøen.|$|E
5|$|Cross-country <b>ski</b> marathons—races with {{distances}} {{greater than}} 40 kilometers—have two cup series, the <b>Ski</b> Classics, {{which started in}} 2011, and the Worldloppet.

5|$|In 1939, the Norwegian <b>Ski</b> Federation {{proposed}} that the Association for the Promotion of Skiing arrange slalom {{as part of the}} Holmenkollen <b>Ski</b> Festival, but the plans were interrupted by World War II. The slalom hill was inaugurated in 1947, allowing Alpine skiing to be introduced in the Holmenkollen <b>Ski</b> Festival. Slalom took place at Rødkleiva while the downhill was carried out at Norefjell <b>Ski</b> Resort in Krødsherad. The event was named Holmenkollen Kandahar and the races in Rødkleiva were organized by SFK Lyn. Permanent cables for telephone and timing were installed in 1949.|$|E

5|$|Increasingly, <b>ski</b> resorts are {{relying on}} snowmaking, the {{production}} of snow by forcing water and pressurized air through a snow gun on <b>ski</b> slopes. Snowmaking is mainly used to supplement natural snow at <b>ski</b> resorts. This allows them to improve the reliability of their snow cover and to extend their <b>ski</b> seasons from late autumn to early spring. The production of snow requires low temperatures. The threshold temperature for snowmaking increases as humidity decreases. Wet bulb temperature {{is used as a}} metric since it takes air temperature and relative humidity into account. Snowmaking is a relatively expensive process in its energy consumption, thereby limiting its use.|$|E
