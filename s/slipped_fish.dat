60|$|Fishing proved slow, {{and it was}} a good {{quarter of}} an hour before he got a bite and then the <b>fish</b> <b>slipped</b> the hook just as he was hauling the catch to the surface. But he kept on and in an hour had a catch of three, all of fair size.|$|R
50|$|The street joins Wood Quay at the <b>Fish</b> <b>Slip</b> near Fyan's Castle. It is {{mentioned}} in the 14th century as Vicus Piscariorum and as Fish Street. In 1577, Stanihurst named it as St John's Street. In 1610, some editions of Speed's map call it Fish Shambles. During the 1950s {{it was for a}} time officially considered part of Moore Street, though in practice it retained it's separate identity.|$|R
50|$|Anabas testudineus, the {{climbing}} perch, is {{a species of}} fish in the family Anabantidae, {{the climbing}} gouramis. It is native to Asia, where it occurs from India east to China and to the Wallace Line. It is an invasive species that can live without water for 6 days. It is believed that the fish may be invading new territories by <b>slipping</b> aboard <b>fishing</b> boats.It has also been established in some countries outside of its native range, in eastern Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. It {{is believed to be}} advancing towards Australia. In late 2005, the fish was discovered on Saibai Island and another small Australian island in the Torres Strait north of Queensland, about three to four miles south of Papua New Guinea.|$|R
40|$|Within the purse-seine fishery {{crowding}} fish at high densities, {{during the}} process of slipping, has been shown to cause high mortalities. Mitigation measures are therefore needed to enable fishermen to avoid <b>slipping</b> <b>fish,</b> particularly when they have a low survival likelihood. Providing a means of assessing the welfare of the catch may provide a solution and behaviour {{has the potential to be}} used as an immediate welfare indicator. The behavioural effects of crowding Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) in purse-seines were analysed from video-footage collected in large-scale field survival experiments. Crowding densities ranging from 1. 5 - 351 kg/m^ 3 were simulated to represent the final stages of purse seining and the process of slipping. A detailed and systematic analysis of several behavioural metrics, describing swimming activity and orientation, is described, including tail beat frequency and amplitude, swimming mode, vertical and horizontal orientation and nearest neighbour distance. Tail beat frequency increased with crowding density and was strongly correlated with mortality. This, combined with a decrease in tail beat frequency from the start to the end of the experiment, suggests that high crowding densities may cause fish to swim to exhaustion. Swimming patterns within each cage were diverse and tail beat amplitude was also exceptionally high compared to other studies. Captivity effects may have impacted some aspects of herring behaviour, as orientation showed unexpectedly large variance across all crowding densities and poor alignment, suggesting a lack of schooling. The occurrence of extreme orientations increased over the duration of the experiment, possibly due to increasing sea bird predation. Orientation did not appear to be influenced by crowding density. Tail beat frequency seems to have the best potential as an indicator of subsequent mortalit...|$|R
60|$|Now, {{the wall}} marked the {{boundary}} between Chatterton's riparian rights and those of Culmeny; and {{it was out of}} idle curiosity that Dane watched his host instead of hailing him as, first looking about him, he descended the bank and hauled in the line. An exclamation of disgust followed as a writhing eel was flung out upon the grass; but there were nobler fish attached, and presently Chatterton stood up holding a splendid trout. Dane remembered that his father had sworn by Chatterton's commercial integrity, but he was not wholly astonished when the man <b>slipped</b> the <b>fish,</b> and a second one which followed it, into his creel. Then, surmising that the angler would not have desired a witness, he turned back softly and met him in the wood, flattering himself that he had arranged the meeting neatly.|$|R
40|$|The {{behavioural}} {{effects of}} confinement of sardine Sardina pilchardus in a purse seine were evaluated through three laboratory experiments simulating {{the final stages}} of purse seining; the process of <b>slipping</b> (deliberately allowing <b>fishes</b> to escape) and subsequent exposure to potential predators. Effects of holding time (the time S. pilchardus were held or entangled in the simulation apparatus) and S. pilchardus density were investigated. Experiment 1 compared the effect of a mild fishing stressor (20 min in the net and low S. pilchardus density) with a control (fishing not simulated) while the second and third experiments compared the mild stressor with a severe stressor (40 min in the net and high S. pilchardus density). In all cases, sea bass Dicentrarchus labrax were used as potential predators. Results indicated a significant effect of crowding time and density on the survival and behaviour of slipped S. pilchardus. After simulated fishing, S. pilchardus showed significant behavioural changes including lower swimming speed, closer approaches to predators and higher nearest-neighbour distances (wider school area) than controls, regardless of stressor severity. These results suggest that, in addition to the delayed and unobserved mortality caused by factors related to <b>fishing</b> operations, <b>slipped</b> pelagic <b>fishes</b> can suffer behavioural impairments that may increase vulnerability to predation. Possible sub-lethal effects of behavioural impairment on fitness are discussed, with suggestions on how stock assessment might be modified to account for both unobserved mortality and sub-lethal effects, and possible approaches to provide better estimates of unobserved mortality in the field are provided.

5000|$|The {{brothers}} {{went on to}} the 2012 Western & Southern Open in Cincinnati, {{where they}} lost in the semi-finals to Lindstedt and Tecău. They {{went on to win the}} 2012 US Open over Paes and Štěpánek (who had beaten the Bryans in the final of the Australian Open earlier in the year). This was the brothers' 12th major title, which meant they had surpassed the Woodies' record of 11, giving the brothers the most major titles in men's doubles in the Open Era. In November, Bob Bryan, who had missed a Davis Cup match due to the birth of his daughter, during which Mike had played with Mardy <b>Fish,</b> <b>slipped</b> behind Mike in the world rankings. This was the first time since August 2003 that the pair had had different rankings. This meant Mike Bryan finished 2012 as world No. 1 on his own.|$|R
60|$|Cooking, farm, gardening, dairy-work, {{setting out}} the table, &c., were all honourable occupations, and of great {{importance}} in teaching punctuality and regularity, and the various arts and decencies of life to the youths, who were in time to implant good habits in their native homes. Their natural docility made them peculiarly easy to manage and train while in hand; the real difficulty was that their life was so entirely different from their home, {{that there was no}} guessing how deep the training went, and, on every voyage, some <b>fishes</b> <b>slipped</b> through the meshes of the net, though some returned again, and others never dropped from their Bishop's hands.

50|$|This is the {{descendant}} of the imported Mycenaean Ware of the past period, which is known also as Mycenaean IIIC1b. This new style of pottery is made locally. Neutron analysis proves {{that it could have}} even been made in the same workshop. It began at approximately the 12th century BC and began to disappear {{towards the end of the}} 11th century BC. The style is slightly influenced by Egypt but mostly by Canaanite. The Mycenaean tradition holds a firm grasp over the shape of the pottery (for example “stirrup jars”), whereas bottles are found to share Cypriot styles (seen by tall and narrow necks). The decoration of this new ware has changed to red and black paints on a whitish <b>slip.</b> Birds and <b>fish</b> are found to be common on Mycenaean IIIC1b but less on the new style, in fact by the second half of the 11th century the bird which was once thought to be sacred disappeared from the pottery.|$|R
5000|$|Clay then works {{overtime}} {{to get the}} money for Clayboy's ring, and his boss Col. Coleman (Hayden Rorke) gives him an added bonus: a day off with pay the day trout season opens. While Clay <b>slips</b> off to <b>fish</b> (instead of working on the house), the town prepares for the arrival of their new minister. Enjoying himself at the river, Clay meets a stranger, who joins him, and Clay tells him about the old granddad of all fish - and offers him a drink from a bottle he calls [...] "insect repellent". Later, the man comments that he finds the [...] "repellent" [...] to be [...] "somewhat numbing". It is in fact moonshine, and the man hooks [...] "old granddad". When the fish gets away, Clay launches into a profanity-laden tirade. The man chides him for his salty speech, and then - right before he plunges head first into the river - reveals that he's Preacher Goodman (Wally Cox), the town's new minister. When he and Clay, drunk and drenched, stumble into town, he is now disgraced to everyone.|$|R
50|$|TO FRY FISH - Most of {{the smaller}} fish (generally termed pan-fish) are usually fried. Clean well, cut off the head, and, if quite large, cut out the backbone, and slice the body {{crosswise}} into five or six pieces; {{season with salt and}} pepper. Dip in Indian meal or wheat flour, or in beaten egg, and roll in bread or fine cracker crumbs trout and perch should not be dipped in meal; put into a thick bottomed iron frying pan, the flesh side down, with hot lardor drippings; fry slowly, turning when lightly browned. PAN-FISH.Place them in a thick bottomed frying pan with heads all one way. Fillthe spaces with smaller fish. When they are fried quite brown and readyto turn, put a dinner plate over them, drain off the fat; then invert thepan, and they will be left unbroken on the plate. Put the lard back intothe pan, and when hot <b>slip</b> back the <b>fish.</b> When the other side is brown,drain, turn on a plate as before, and slip them on a warm platter, to besent to the table. Leaving the heads on and the fish a crispy-brown, inperfect shape, improves the appearance if not the flavor. Garnish with slices of lemon.|$|R
40|$|Restricted until 03 Nov. 2011. The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} strain accumulation and release patterns of faults remain an enigma, which has received {{an enormous amount of}} attention from geologists. Although the faults of the Eastern California shear zone (ECSZ), including the Garlock fault, {{are some of the most}} studied in the world, we still have only limited understanding of their role in the Pacific-North America plate boundary deformation. Geodetic models suggest that the right-lateral northwest-southeast striking ECSZ is the main fault system accumulating strain east of the San Andreas fault, while the left-lateral almost east-west striking Garlock fault has low strain accumulation rates. More geochronologically constrained slip rates are needed from the faults of the ECSZ and Garlock fault in order to determine whether strain storage and release are constant in this region. As part of this dissertation, I focused on several locations along the Garlock fault in southern California, and the Fish Lake Valley Fault (FLVF) in the northern part of the ECSZ, where I used Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) digital topographic data to measure normal fault scarps and restore offset alluvial fans to their pre-faulting positions. Combining those restorations with cosmogenic 10 Be geochronology of the offset deposits, I was able to determine slip rates along the FLVF and Garlock fault systems.; Besides the major right-lateral component of <b>slip,</b> the <b>Fish</b> Lake Valley fault also exhibits a normal slip component. Offset scarp measurements combined with cosmogenic nuclide geochronology from four sites yield late a Pleistocene-Holocene horizontal extension slip rate that ranges from 0. 1 ± 0. 1 mm/yr to 0. 7 + 0. 3 /- 0. 1 mm/yr. Comparison of this slip rate with geodetic measurements of ~ 1 mm/yr of extension across the northern ECSZ indicates that the FLVF accommodates approximately half of the current rate of regional extension. When summed with published rates of extension for faults at the same latitude, the FLVF data indicate that long-term geologic deformation rates are commensurate with short-term geodetic extension rates.; Combining an offset measurement of an incised channel across the central Garlock fault with a modeled 10 Be surface age, yield a late Pleistocene-Holocene slip rate of 5. 3 + 1. 0 /- 2. 0 mm/yr, and a maximum rate of ~ 6. 6 ± 1. 2 mm/yr. This rate is similar to previously published geologic slip rates to the west and east of the study site, but it is at least twice as fast compared to reported geodetic strain accumulation rates along the Garlock fault. The similarities, in terms of channel offsets and ages of the incised surfaces between multiple sites along the fault, are indicative of climatically controlled aggradational and degradational events throughout time that are regional in extent. In addition, these data suggest that, as proposed before, a strain transient could be present along the Garlock fault and strain accumulation and release rates have not remained constant through time.; Such a strain transient has also been proposed for the ECSZ south of the Garlock fault. As part of this dissertation, I also studied the paleoseismic record of the Calico fault, the fastest slipping fault in the southern ECSZ. Evidence of surface ruptures between 0. 6 - 2 - 0 ka, 5. - 5. 6 ka, 5. 6 - 6. 1 (or possibly 7. 3) ka, and 6. 1 (or 7. 3) to 8. 4 ka along the Calico fault, coincide with similar clusters elsewhere in southern ECSZ. These data strongly reinforce earlier suggestions that earthquake recurrence in the ECSZ is highly clustered in time and space...|$|R
6000|$|While {{the corn}} ripened, Wainamoinen rested from his labours, {{and took the}} task of Orpheus. 'He sang,' says the 'Kalevala,' {{of the origin of}} things, of the mysteries hidden from babes, that none may attain to in this sad life, in the hours of these {{perishable}} days. The fame of the Runoia's singing excited jealousy in the breast of one of the men around him, of whose origin the 'Kalevala' gives no account. This man, Joukahainen, provoked him to a trial of song, boasting, like Empedocles, or like one of the old Celtic bards, that he had been all things. 'When the earth was made I was there; when space was unrolled I launched the sun on his way.' Then was Wainamoinen wroth, and by the force of his enchantment he rooted Joukahainen to the ground, and suffered him not to go free without promising him the hand of his sister Aino. The mother was delighted; but the girl wept that she must now cover her long locks, her curls, her glory, and be the wife of 'the old imperturbable Wainamoinen.' It is in vain that her mother offers her dainty food and rich dresses; she flees from home, and wanders till she meets three maidens bathing, and joins them, and is drowned, singing a sad song: 'Ah, never may my sister come to bathe in the sea-water, for the drops of the sea are the drops of my blood.' This wild idea occurs in the Romaic ballad, [Greek], where a drop of blood on the lips of the drowned girl tinges all the waters of the world. To return to the fate of Aino. A swift hare runs (as in the Zulu legend of the Origin of Death) with the tale of sorrow to the maiden's mother, and from the mother's tears flow rivers of water, and therein are isles with golden hills where golden birds make melody. As for the old, the imperturbable Runoia, he loses his claim to the latter title, he is filled with sorrow, and searches through all the elements for his lost bride. At length he catches a fish which is unknown to him, who, like Atlas, 'knew the depths of all the seas.' The strange <b>fish</b> <b>slips</b> from his hands, a 'tress of hair, of drowned maiden's hair,' floats for a moment on the foam, and too late he recognises that 'there was never salmon yet that shone so fair, above the nets at sea.' His lost bride has been within his reach, and now is doubly lost to him. Suddenly the waves are cloven asunder, and the mother of Nature and of Wainamoinen appears, to comfort her son, like Thetis from the deep. She bids him go and seek, in the land of Pohjola, a bride alien to his race. After many a wild adventure, Wainamoinen reaches Pohjola and is kindly entreated by Loutri, the mother of the maiden of the land. But he grows homesick, and complains, almost in Dante's words, of the bitter bread of exile. Loutri will only grant him her daughter's hand on condition that he gives her a sampo. A sampo is a mysterious engine that grinds meal, salt, and money. In fact, it is the mill in the well-known fairy tale, 'Why the Sea is Salt.' {169} ...|$|R
