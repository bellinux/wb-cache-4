5000|$|The Our Gang {{character}} of Buckwheat, portrayed {{as an adult}} by Eddie Murphy, sang current hits in garbled speech. His first appearance, on October 10, 1981, was in a commercial parody for an album titled, Buh-Weet Sings. Right before each song, subtitles on the screen would list the name, spelled phonetically exactly as Buckwheat would say it (example: Looking for Love became Wookin' Pa Nub and Three Times a Lady became Fee Tines a Mady). One song, Bette Davis Eyes is so poorly pronounced that the <b>superimposed</b> <b>title</b> is [...] "???". Those who wanted to purchase the album were instructed to send money to [...] "Bah Firty Fee, New Nork, New Nork".|$|E
5000|$|A <b>superimposed</b> <b>title</b> [...] "Hour of the Wolf" [...] {{marks the}} end of part one and the {{beginning}} of the second part. Again, Alma stays awake with Johan who cannot sleep. He tells her of the [...] "vargtimmen" [...] ("Hour of the Wolf"), during which, he says, most births and deaths occur. He also recounts his desperate love affair with Veronica and his childhood trauma of being locked into a cupboard where, as his parents said, a small man lived who fed on children's toes. Then he recalls a confrontation with a small boy which occurred some time ago and culminated in his killing of the boy. Whether this encounter actually took place or is imaginary is never revealed. Alma is shocked by Johan's confessions.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} UK releases have episode <b>titles</b> <b>superimposed</b> {{over the}} openings of the episodes (series 1-4). The 2013 re-release {{of the complete}} series box set omits the majority, {{but not all of}} these <b>superimposed</b> <b>titles.</b> The American releases have no on-screen episode titles, reflecting the way that the shows were originally transmitted.|$|R
50|$|The first {{versions}} for the Amiga computer were a video titler {{and slide}} show authoring system. Scala was bundled with typefaces, background images, and {{a selection of}} transition effects {{to be applied to}} them. The artwork was designed by Bjørn Rybakken. Scala was also capable of working with Genlock equipment to <b>superimpose</b> <b>titles</b> over footage played through the devices video input.|$|R

5000|$|According to MGM's {{dialogue}} cutting {{continuity and}} Leonard Maltin's audio {{commentary on the}} current DVD release, the film originally began (after the opening credits) {{with the image of}} a [...] "boat on canal". A <b>superimposed</b> <b>title</b> read, [...] "ITALY - WHERE THEY SING ALL DAY AND GO TO THE OPERA AT NIGHT", and was followed by a musical number featuring bits and pieces from Leoncavallo's Pagliacci performed by [...] "everyday" [...] Italians: a street sweeper sings part of the prologue ("Un nido di memorie...") as he greets a man who then hands out opera tickets to a group of children emerging from a store; the children respond with [...] "la-la-la-la-la, verso un paese strano" [...] (from [...] "Stridono lassù"); a [...] "captain" [...] comes down a set of steps, salutes a sentry, then bursts into [...] "Vesti la giubba"; then, a lap dissolve into a hotel lobby, where a [...] "baggage man" [...] is rolling a trunk and crooning about [...] "nettare divino" [...] ("divine nectar"); a waiter joins the baggage man in song, enters the dining room, and sings as he serves a man who for a few notes also sings; the waiter then crosses the dining room to speak to Mrs. Claypool (Margaret Dumont), marking the beginning of the film in existing copies. Maltin stated the scene was cut during World War II to remove references to Italy, and unfortunately, the main negative was cut as well, so the scene is now lost.This notable cut, with several other small ones made at about the same time, is why the stated running time of the film (95 minutes) was three minutes longer than that of existing prints.|$|E
5000|$|Using a Moviola, Weinberg {{then began}} to <b>superimpose</b> <b>titles</b> over the moving images of the film: At the beginning, I was very {{cautious}} and superimposed hardly more than 25 or 30 titles to a ten-minute reel...Then I'd go into the theatre during a showing to watch the audience's faces, {{to see how they}} reacted to the titles. I'd wondered {{if they were going to}} drop their heads slightly to read the titles at the bottom of the screen and then raise them again after they read the titles ... but I didn't have worried ... they didn't drop their heads, they merely dropped their eyes, I noticed.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first public}} {{screening}} of L'Homme du large {{took place on}} 3 December 1920 at the Gaumont Palace in Paris. It was enthusiastically received by {{both the public and}} the press. [...] Its critical reputation was well-sustained in subsequent years. Film archivist Henri Langlois described it as [...] "the first example of film writing". He argued that the film was not just a narrative of events linked together by intertitles, but a sequence of images whose message conveyed an idea; the <b>superimposed</b> <b>titles</b> reinforced the images in the manner of ideograms. While some critics were troubled by the contrast between the film's natural environment of coast and sea and its aesthetic use of frequent editing wipes, irises and superimpositions, there was broader appreciation for the rhythmic structure of shots and sequences, forming what L'Herbier saw as a [...] "musical composition".|$|R

50|$|A single palette {{entry in}} an indexed color image can be {{designated}} as a transparent color, in order to perform a simple video overlay: superimposing a given image over a background in such way that {{some part of the}} overlapped image obscures the background and the remaining not. <b>Superimposing</b> film/TV <b>titles</b> and credits is a typical application of video overlay.|$|R
2500|$|Unexpected {{rock music}} {{performance}} appearances included Tina Turner, David Bowie, and Iggy Pop. Shore also {{appeared on the}} Norman Lear comedy-soap opera Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman in April 1976. On the show, Dinah interviewed country singing character Loretta Haggars (played by Mary Kay Place) and included a controversial comment from Miss Haggars during her appearance on a [...] "Live" [...] airing of Ms. Shore's talk show. Shore had the misfortune of interviewing the comedian Andy Kaufman in his Tony Clifton guise on her show. He took deliberate offense at her questions and eventually tipped a pan of eggs over her head. This program was taped live {{in front of a}} studio audience and the [...] "eggs" [...] segment was never aired; it is believed that the offending footage was destroyed. Shore's producers <b>superimposed</b> <b>titles</b> such as [...] "This is a put on" [...] over the footage that was eventually aired, including an uncomfortable duet of [...] "Anything You Can Do", and his solo of [...] "On The Street Where You Live". Shooting was stopped and Kaufman was escorted out of the studio.|$|R

They were 7” x 9” with a hard cover (without a dust jacket) whose face was a {{black-and-white}} photograph with the <b>title</b> <b>superimposed.</b> They omitted the original editions’ fold-out maps but instead printed them in two separate atlases.|$|R
5000|$|All five cover sleeves for Rock 'n' Roll Circus were {{photographed by}} {{photographer}} and designer Hijika. The standalone CD artwork has Hamasaki in a leopard print dress, {{standing in a}} canyon with Hamasaki's name and the album <b>title</b> <b>superimposed</b> on her. This marks Hamasaki's first ever cover sleeve to be photographed and directed outside of Japan. The CD and music video DVD format has a close-up of Hamasaki's face, with Hamasaki's name and the album <b>title</b> <b>superimposed</b> on her. The Playbutton box uses the CD and DVD cover, while the Playbutton device has a gold [...] "G" [...] symbol over an orange background. The digital release uses the standalone CD format.

500|$|The {{reviewer}} from The Times said [...] "All {{the devices}} are infinitely sophisticated, {{and so is}} the film: the tradition of self-mockery continues, though at times it over-reaches itself", also saying that [...] "It is the mixture as before, only more so: it is superb hokum." [...] Connery's acting efforts were overlooked by this reviewer, who did say: [...] "There is some excellent bit-part playing by Mr. Bernard Lee and Mr. Harold Sakata: Mr. Gert Fröbe is astonishingly well cast in the difficult part of Goldfinger." [...] Donald Zec, writing for the Daily Mirror said of the film that [...] "Ken Adam's set designs are brilliant; the direction of Guy Hamilton tautly exciting; Connery is better than ever, and the <b>titles</b> <b>superimposed</b> on the gleaming body of the girl in gold are inspired." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Taboo" [...] {{was directed by}} [...] The video opens with Koda's name and the song <b>title</b> <b>superimposed</b> on a dining table. It shows several guests inside a mansion dancing and drinking at the table, and then shows Koda singing in a maid outfit. Small inter cut scenes features Koda kissing two woman; one on the cheek, {{and one on the}} lips. This emphasizes the homosexual themes that Koda explained to World Journal and Oricon. Koda starts to sing in a living room, surrounded by several guests. She walks into a bathroom, and her maid outfit transforms into a small black jumpsuit, similar to the look from the CD cover sleeve of [...] "Taboo". Several guests appear in the bathroom dancing and grinding each other, occasionally touching Koda until she runs away.|$|R
5000|$|McGoohan {{receives}} no onscreen acting {{credit in}} this episode. The episode opens with the series <b>title</b> <b>superimposed</b> {{over the first}} moments of the [...] "Once Upon a Time" [...] recap, with the location credit, episode title, guest stars, David Tomblin's producer credit and McGoohan's [...] "written and directed by" [...] credit over aerial footage of Portmeirion following that sequence. At the end, after the names of Kanner, McKern, and Muscat appear as captions over the actors themselves (still in character), an extreme aerial shot of the Lotus on London streets (the driver is not actually recognizable) is captioned simply, [...] "Prisoner". Nor does McGoohan receive his usual executive producer credit; in [...] "Living in Harmony" [...] and [...] "The Girl Who Was Death" [...] it is replaced with a large [...] "Starring Patrick McGoohan as The Prisoner" [...] credit, but here his name appears onscreen only as writer/director.|$|R
2500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} was directed and produced by Tomu Izawa, and despite Utada's previous musical work, {{it is her}} visual debut. The visual opens with a small intro screen of Utada and the songs title, and disappears to show Utada sitting and singing on a yellow sofa, {{in front of a}} closed garage door. As the chourus, she starts to dance with various close-up shots of her face. The second verse and chorus showcases Utada in a small blue room lit by a LED light, and <b>superimposed</b> the songs <b>title</b> on various scenes. It ends with the singers title against her face, as the screen is tinted blue. The clip was included on her 1999 DVD collection Singles Clip Collection Vol. 1, and subsequently on the 15th anniversary edition of First Love, which included all the visuals from the record. The yellow sofa and garage door scene was parodied in Halcali's single [...] "Tandem", and subsequently through Utada's single [...] "Goodbye Happiness" [...] (Nov 2010), which she directed herself.|$|R
2500|$|During seasons one and two, {{the opening}} {{sequence}} begins {{with images of}} Balki and Larry wiping sideways from {{opposite sides of the}} screen to meet in the middle, with the series <b>title</b> <b>superimposed</b> on top. [...] Larry is shown saying good-bye to his family as he leaves his home in Wisconsin, and drives to Chicago in his old red Ford Mustang. [...] The sequence then shifts to Balki, who is shown making his own farewells on Mypos before being driven off {{on the back of a}} horsecart, sitting alongside a box mislabeled [...] "America or Burst". [...] Balki is next seen on the tramp steamer as he sights the Statue of Liberty, then on a bus, presumably making his way to Chicago. [...] After a brief shot of Larry driving under a [...] "Welcome to Chicago" [...] sign (in reality, located on eastbound Interstate 190 leading out of O'Hare International Airport), the sequence ends with the same shot of Balki and Larry together that began the sequence. [...] The first season featured a script font for the series title and credits. [...] For the second season, the show's title appears more similar to later seasons, and the script font is replaced with the fonts similar to that used in the remaining seasons. [...] The Lake Shore Drive footage is now shown correctly. [...] Additionally, the Larry and Balki sequences are shortened so that brief clips from some of the early episodes could be shown.|$|R
