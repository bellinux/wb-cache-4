Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were guests of honour, {{making it the}} <b>second</b> <b>Bond</b> film premiere to be {{attended}} by the Queen, the first one being You Only Live Twice in 1967. The Royal Albert Hall had a make-over for the screening and had been transformed into an ice palace. Proceeds from the première, about £500,000, were donated to the Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund of which the Queen is patron. On the first day, ticket sales reached £1.2 million. Die Another Day was the highest grossing James Bond film until the release of Casino Royale. It earned $432 million worldwide, becoming the sixth highest-grossing film of 2002.|$|E
25|$|For over 35 years, Hartington had no large indoor venue. In 1919, after {{a series}} of prosperous years {{resulting}} from high grain prices during and immediately after World War I, voters passed a bond issue of $25,000 for the purpose of erecting a new city hall with multiple uses, including an auditorium. When that amount proved insufficient, a <b>second</b> <b>bond</b> issue of $25,000 was approved in 1920.|$|E
25|$|Once all {{lone pairs}} are placed, atoms—especially the central atoms—may {{not have an}} octet of {{electrons}}. In this case, the atoms must form a double bond; a {{lone pair of electrons}} is moved to form a <b>second</b> <b>bond</b> between the two atoms. As the bonding pair is shared between the two atoms, the atom that originally had the lone pair still has an octet; the other atom now has two more electrons in its valence shell.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the effect of surface treatments such as tooth reduction and extending the etching time on microtensile bond strength (µTBS) of composite resin to normal and fluorotic enamel after microabrasion. Materials and Methods: Fifty non-carious anterior teeth were classified into two groups of normal and fluorotic (n= 25) using Thylstrup and Fejerskov index (TFI= 4 - 6). Teeth in each group were treated with five modalities as follows and restored with OptiBond FL and Z 350 composite resin: 1 -Etching (30 <b>seconds),</b> <b>bonding,</b> filling (B); 2 -Tooth reduction (0. 3 mm), etching, bonding, filling (R-B); 3 -Microabrasion (120 <b>seconds),</b> etching, <b>bonding,</b> filling (M-B); 4 - Microabrasion, tooth reduction, etching, bonding, filling (M-R-B); and 5 - Microabrasion, etching (60 <b>seconds),</b> <b>bonding,</b> filling (M- 2 E-B). Ten experimental groups (n= 5) were designed; 150 rectangular samples (10 in each group) with a cross-sectional area of 1 × 1 mm 2 were prepared for µTBS test. Failure mode was determined under a stereomicroscope and one specimen was selected from each group for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. Data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA and Tukey’s test. Results: The µTBS to normal enamel was higher than to fluorotic enamel in all groups except for group (R-B). The Maximum and minimum µTBS were noted in the group (normal, reduction, bonding) and (fluorosed, microabrasion, bonding), respectively.   Tooth reduction increased µTBS more effectively than extended etching time after microabrasion. Conclusions: Fluorosis may reduce µTBS of composite resin to enamel. Microabrasion reduced the bond strength. Tooth reduction and extended etching time increased µTBS of composite resin to both normal and fluorotic enamel.

25|$|During {{the early}} years of the Depression from 1930 to 1932, the city {{allocated}} $1.5 million of its funds toward relief operations, while the Salvation Army and the St. Vincent de Paul Society provided another $2 million. In late 1932, St. Louis voters passed a $4.6 million bond issue to provide more relief funds, and in the spring of 1933, Mayor Bernard Dickmann and the Board of Aldermen balanced the city budget by reducing expenditures by 11 percent. Federal relief programs began contributing funds in May 1933, but St. Louis issued a <b>second</b> <b>bond</b> for relief funds in February 1935 for $3.6 million. Of the $68 million spent on relief in St. Louis from 1932 to 1936, $50 million came from the federal government, $12 million came from the city and local agencies, and only $6 million from the state.|$|E
500|$|The {{screenplay}} of Moonraker differed so {{much from}} Ian Fleming's novel that Eon Productions authorised the film's screenwriter, Christopher Wood to write a novelisation; this would be his <b>second</b> <b>Bond</b> novelisation.

500|$|The film From Russia with Love was {{released}} in 1963, produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, and directed by Terence Young. It was the <b>second</b> <b>Bond</b> film in the Eon Productions series and starred Sean Connery as Bond. The film version contained some changes to the novel, with the leading villains switching from SMERSH to SPECTRE, a fictional terrorist organisation. In the main it was a faithful adaptation of the novel; the ending was changed to make clear Bond's survival. Benson declares that [...] "many fans consider it the best Bond film, simply because it is close to Fleming's original story".|$|E

500|$|The soundtrack to The World Is Not Enough is the <b>second</b> <b>Bond</b> soundtrack to be {{composed}} by David Arnold. Arnold broke tradition by not ending the film with a reprise {{of the opening}} theme or, as with the previous three films, a new song. Originally, Arnold intended to use the song [...] "Only Myself to Blame" [...] {{at the end of}} the film; however, Apted discarded this and the song was replaced by a remix of the [...] "James Bond Theme". [...] "Only Myself to Blame", written by Arnold and Don Black and sung by Scott Walker, is the nineteenth and final track on the album and its melody is Elektra King's theme. The theme is heard in [...] "Casino", [...] "Elektra's Theme" [...] and [...] "I Never Miss". Arnold added two new themes to the final score, both of which are reused in the following film, Die Another Day.|$|E
500|$|Once Fleming and {{his wife}} arrived at Goldeneye, he started work on the <b>second</b> <b>Bond</b> novel. In May 1963 he wrote an article for Books and Bookmen {{magazine}} describing his approach to writing, in which he said: [...] "I write for about three hours in the morning... and I do another hour's work between six and seven in the evening. I never correct anything and I {{never go back to}} see what I have written... By following my formula, you write 2,000 words a day." [...] As he had done with Casino Royale, Fleming showed the manuscript to his friend, the writer William Plomer, who reacted favourably to the story, telling Fleming that [...] "the new book held this reader like a limpet mine & the denouement was shattering". On a trip to the US in May 1953 Fleming used his five-day travelling time on RMS Queen Elizabeth to correct the proofs of the novel.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert for the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film 3½ stars out of 4, saying [...] "the stunts all look convincing, {{and the effect}} of the closing {{sequence}} is exhilarating...

Kroll was mixed in his appraisal of Dalton, calling him [...] "a fine actor who hasn't yet stamped Bond with his own personality", observing [...] "Director John Glen is the Busby Berkeley of action flicks, and his chorus line is the legendary team of Bond stunt-persons who are at their death-defying best here". For Time magazine, Richard Corliss bemoaned that although the truck stunts were good, it was [...] "a pity nobody – not writers Michael G. Wilson, and Richard Maibaum nor director John Glen – thought to give the humans anything very clever to do." [...] Corliss found Dalton [...] "misused" [...] in the film, adding that [...] "for every plausible reason, he looks as bored in his <b>second</b> <b>Bond</b> film as Sean Connery did in his sixth." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{saturated}} fat {{is a type}} of fat in which the fatty acid chains have all or predominantly single bonds. [...] A fat is made of two kinds of smaller molecules: glycerol and fatty acids. Fats are made of long chains of carbon (C) atoms. Some carbon atoms are linked by single bonds (-C-C-) and others are linked by double bonds (-C=C-). Double bonds can react with hydrogen to form single bonds. They are called saturated, because the <b>second</b> <b>bond</b> is broken up and each half of the bond is attached to (saturated with) a hydrogen atom. Most animal fats are saturated. The fats of plants and fish are generally unsaturated. Saturated fats tend to have higher melting points than their corresponding un{{saturated fat}}s, leading to the popular understanding that saturated fats tend to be solids at room temperatures, while unsaturated fats tend to be liquid at room temperature with varying degrees of viscosity (meaning both saturated and unsaturated fats are found to be liquid at body temperature).|$|E
2500|$|AWC's initial {{development}} efforts were funded by several bond sales.

The bond sale was expected to generate about $75 million for the AWC, which would {{use the money to}} make infrastructure improvements at Hill East, Poplar Point, and the Southwest waterfront. Another $140 million of the PILOT bonds would fund infrastructure improvements around the new United States Department of Transportation headquarters (then being built at 1200 New Jersey Avenue SE, near the Navy Yard – Ballpark Metro station) and within the Federal Center Southeast. In November 2006, the AWC said it would offer a <b>second</b> <b>bond</b> issue to raise $100 million to make infrastructure improvements at and remove trash from Hill East/Reservation 13 and Poplar Point. The AWC said it would receive a share of a September 2006 sale of $248 million in Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement bonds to build a $60 million medical office building complex at Hill East. The city sold $140 million in PILOT bonds to build a $40 million park along the Anacostia River between South Capitol Street and 2nd Street SE and to fund $75 million in miscellaneous AWC projects. Another $90 million in PILOT bonds went on sale in February 2007 to help pay for infrastructure improvements at Federal Center Southeast.|$|E
