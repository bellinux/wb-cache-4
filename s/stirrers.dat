25|$|In African-American music, gospel quartets {{developed}} an a cappella style following the earlier {{success of the}} Fisk Jubilee Singers. The 1930s saw the Fairfield Four, the Dixie Hummingbirds, the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi, the Five Blind Boys of Alabama, The Soul <b>Stirrers,</b> the Swan Silvertones, the Charioteers, and the Golden Gate Quartet. Racism divided the nation, and this division did not skip the church. If during slavery blacks were treated as inferior inside the white churches, after emancipation they formed their own separate churches. The gospel groups which were very popular within the black community, were virtually unknown to the white community, though some in the white community began to follow them. In addition to these high-profile quartets, there were many black gospel musicians performing in the 1920s and 30s, usually playing the guitar and singing {{in the streets of}} Southern cities.

In the present work we have implemented an on-line image analysis set-up that is able to capture all the images of the particles at the outlet of a continuous pilot-scale mixer. This allows the determination of the homogeneity of mixtures of two different compositions, as well as the analysis of their evolution during steady-state and transitory regimes. The importance of a proper definition of the scale of scrutiny of the mixture is emphasized by providing homogeneity results obtained at four different scales. Evidence of segregation by percolation giving rise to the enrichment of the mixer's bed with fine particles is given and commented. The impact of the <b>stirrer's</b> rotational speed {{on the quality of the}} mixtures, as provided by the coefficient of variation CV, is reported. Up to 20 Hz, CV's are extremely high, while above 30 Hz, the influence of the impeller speed is much weaker. Finally, the influence of impeller speed's step perturbations is measured and commented. Due to the size – segregation phenomenon inside the mixer, negative steps are deeply detrimental to the mixing process.

As he taught Johnson's music to young musicians, groups and acts like the Soul <b>Stirrers,</b> the Staples Singers, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Fairport Convention, and Peter, Paul and Mary covered or re-interpreted his work. In November 1962, Bob Dylan recorded a rendition of [...] "Jesus Make Up My Dying Bed", retitled [...] "In My Time of Dying", for his self-titled debut album.

In 1969, she recorded an album for Capitol Records, Soul and Inspiration, consisting of pop songs from Broadway plays, Hollywood movies and the Jimmy Radcliffe song of hope [...] "If You Wanna Change The World". This album was later reissued on the Capitol's budget Pickwick label minus one track. In the same year, she recorded an album in Copenhagen, Denmark on the Philips label, Walk A Mile In My Shoes, which included the pop title song, other pop songs (such as [...] "California Dreaming") and a few gospel songs. She also recorded an album for MGM/Verve, Hang Your Tears Out To Dry, which included country and Western, blues/folk, pop and an arrangement of the Beatles' hit song, [...] "Help".

2500|$|His first pop/soul single was [...] "Lovable" [...] (1956), {{a remake}} of the gospel song [...] "Wonderful".

However, it fooled no one—Cooke's unique and distinctive vocals were easily recognized. Art Rupe, head of Specialty Records, the label of the Soul <b>Stirrers,</b> gave his blessing for Cooke to record secular music under his real name, but he was unhappy about the type of music Cooke and producer Bumps Blackwell were making. Rupe expected Cooke's secular music to be similar to that of another Specialty Records artist, Little Richard. When Rupe walked in on a recording session and heard Cooke covering Gershwin, he was quite upset. After an argument between Rupe and Blackwell, Cooke and Blackwell left the label.|$|E

As described above for whole-animal respirometry the choice of materials is very important. Plastic materials are not suitable for the chamber because of their oxygen storage capacity. When plastic materials are unavoidable (e.g. for o-rings, coatings of <b>stirrers,</b> or stoppers) polymers with a very low oxygen permeability (like PVDF as opposed to e.g. PTFE) may be used. Remaining oxygen diffusion into or out of the chamber materials can be handled by correcting the measured oxygen fluxes for the instrumental oxygen background flux.
