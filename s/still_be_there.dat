However, Mark Wallace performed better, adding 86 from 107 balls to <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> {{at the close}} of play. Surrey probably had the best of the day, which ended with the Dragons on 238 for 9. However, {{it could have been a}} lot worse for Glamorgan, as David Hemp was dropped three times. Mohammad Akram got good rewards for his bowling, taking four wickets.|$|E
25|$|Several bombs {{landed on}} the {{hospital}} and its grounds during the war. It was close to two strategic targets: the AEC factory in Windmill Lane which built fighting vehicles, and the Wharncliffe Viaduct which carried the Great Western Railway, a vital transport route. Some of the UXBs fell into the soft sediment of the River Brent, and some may <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>there.</b> However a V1 hit the hospital laundry and caused many casualties. This event is mentioned in a personal account by Simon Tobitt in WW2 Peoples War. The Gatehouse also received some bomb damage.|$|E
500|$|However, {{many other}} types of animals {{have been shown to}} have the ability for object {{permanence}}. These include dogs, cats, and a few species of birds such as the carrion crow, Eurasian jays and food-storing magpies. [...] Dogs are able to reach a level of object permanence that allows them to find food after it has been hidden beneath one of two cups and rotated 90°. [...] Similarly, cats are able to understand object permanence but not to the same extent that dogs can. Cats fail to understand that if they see something go into an apparatus in one direction that it will <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> if the cat tries to enter from another direction. However, while cats {{did not seem to be}} quite as good at this ‘invisible displacement test’ as dogs are, it’s hard to say whether their poorer performance is a true reflection of their abilities or just due to the way in which they’ve been tested. A longitudinal study found that carrion crows' ability developed gradually, albeit with slight changes in the order of mastery compared to human infants. There was only one task, task 15, that the crows were not able to master. The crows showed perseverative searches at a previously rewarded location (the so-called ‘A-not-B error’). They mastered visible rotational displacements consistently, but failed at more complex invisible rotational displacements. [...] Another study tested the comparison of how long it took food-storing magpies to develop the object permanence necessary for them to be able to live independently. [...] The research suggests that these magpies followed a very similar pattern as human infants while they were developing.|$|E

2500|$|The {{impression}} {{from the}} valley floor {{that this is a}} round dome that has lost its northwest half is an illusion.

2500|$|I {{therefore}} {{can understand the}} imposition of a 25-year time limit only as a holding that the deference the Court pays to the Law School's educational judgments and refusal to change its admissions policies will itself expire.

2500|$|Major General John Edward Bernard Seely, 1st Baron Mottistone [...] (31 May 1868 – 7 November 1947) was a British Army {{general and}} politician. He was a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) from 1900 to 1904 and a Liberal MP from 1904 to 1922 and from 1923 to 1924.

2500|$|The {{defendant}} {{had argued}} that anticipatory warrants in general violated the Fourth Amendment's requirement that [...] "no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause," [...] because the anticipated probable cause does not exist {{at the time of}} the warrant's issuance. The Court first noted that the courts of appeals had unanimously rejected this argument. It asserted that all warrants are in a sense [...] "anticipatory," [...] because any search is only reasonable if there is probable cause for it when the search is conducted. [...] "In the typical case where the police seek permission to search a house for an item they believe is already located there, the magistrate's determination that there is probable cause for the search amounts to a prediction that the item will <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> when the warrant is executed." [...] The Court concluded that this makes anticipatory warrants no different in principle from ordinary warrants.|$|E
2500|$|Before Ellie died, {{she left}} a piece of advice for Peyton {{regarding}} Peyton's love life, telling her that it is {{never too late to}} pursue her romantic interest. Peyton decides to give love another try and dates Pete Wentz from Fall Out Boy. Their relationship does not work out, since Pete is busy with touring. Peyton's father tells her to follow her heart and listen to it, so Peyton, considering Ellie's advice as well, decides to give Jake a visit in Savannah; she knows that she still loves him and feels that this will be enough for her to be happy. She renews her relationship with Jake and Jenny, and even goes far enough to propose marriage to Jake, who gladly accepts. This happiness fades once Jake overhears Peyton say, [...] "I love you, Lucas" [...] in her sleep. Peyton is then forced to confront Jake about the kiss she and Lucas shared {{on the day of the}} shooting. Jake figures that while Peyton loves him, she is in love with Lucas. He tells her to go back to Tree Hill, and to find out if Lucas is still in her heart. If he is not, Jake promises to <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> waiting. Peyton does as Jake has advised. In the finale, Brooke once again ends her friendship with Peyton after Peyton tells her that she still has romantic feelings for Lucas. Lucas later tells Brooke about the kiss in the library. At the end of the episode, Peyton burns pictures of herself with Brooke. She then picks up a picture of the three of them (herself, Brooke and Lucas) and burns it.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2015, Daniel Kilkelly (Digital Spy) {{revealed}} {{plans for}} Daniel's [...] "good-natured" [...] personality {{to change as}} {{he turned away from}} his hippy ideals. Daniel changed his look and became more career-driven. Of the changes to Daniel's personality, Phillipps explained: [...] "I think it's an important change that had to happen for Daniel's development. He's always been a positive person, and I don't think that goes away in this storyline. But Daniel has been under Paul's guidance for a long time now. It's made him start to understand some really important life messages about how sometimes you've got to take more risks, be more ruthless and push a little harder. It's all part of Daniel's evolution as a character." [...] Phillipps told Kilkelly that he spoke to the writers about giving Daniel [...] "more status" [...] within the community and believed that making him more career-driven would be a good way for him to gain respect from other characters. The actor also believed that viewers would find Daniel more interesting, but added that his positive attitude would <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>there.</b> Daniel began working at Lassiter's Hotel, following his brief stint in real estate sales. He already knew the hotel business from working alongside Paul. Daniel's new attitude and career change was marked by a new haircut. Phillipps had chosen to shave his hair off, so the writers incorporated his new style into the storyline. Phillipps added that he would not like to see Daniel become a copy of his uncle, but he did want Daniel to be [...] "strong-willed and street smart" [...] like him.|$|E
2500|$|On 22 January 2007, {{the punk}} wave {{magazine}} Side-Line {{broke the story}} the Police would reunite for the Grammys, and would perform [...] "Roxanne". Side-Line also stated the Police were {{to embark on a}} massive world tour. Billboard magazine later confirmed the news, quoting Andy Summers' 2006 statement as to how the band could have continued post-Synchronicity: [...] "The more rational approach would have been, 'OK, Sting, go make a solo record, and let's get back together in two or three years.' I'm certain we could have done that. Of course we could have. We were definitely not in a creative dry space. We could have easily carried on, and we could probably <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>there.</b> That wasn't to be our fate. It went in another way. I regret we never paid it off with a last tour." [...] The band opened the 49th Annual Grammy Awards on 11 February 2007 in Los Angeles, announcing, [...] "Ladies and gentlemen, we are the Police, and we're back!" [...] before launching into [...] "Roxanne". After the dissolution of the Police, Sting adamantly refused to reunite with Copeland or Summers for any prolonged period, often commenting [...] "If I ever reform the Police I should be certified insane." [...] However, by 2007, he had a change of heart. When asked what prompted the reunion, Sting said [...] "I'd just done the lute album—Songs from the Labyrinth. I was thinking: 'Well what do I do? What's going to surprise people?' I just had this instinct, this desire to call the guys up and say: 'Let's give this a go.'" [...] Sting added he saw the reunion as [...] "a kind of healing. I think solving problems is an exercise worth doing".|$|E
2500|$|Another {{context in}} which the common law left workers {{particularly}} vulnerable was where the business for which they worked was transferred between one person and another. In Nokes v Doncaster Amalgamated Collieries Ltd it was held (albeit to protect the worker from draconian sanctions in the arcane Employers and Workmen Act 1875) that an employment contract could not transfer without the consent of the parties involved. Consequently, in a situation where company A sold its assets (including contracts) to company B, the employment relationship would sever and the only claim a worker would have for dismissal would be against company A. Particularly from the 1950s, the view was increasingly accepted across Europe that workers have something more than a personal right, and akin to a property right in their jobs. Just as the transfer of a freehold property between two landlords would not mean that a tenant could be evicted, the first Transfers of Undertakings Directive, passed in 1978 and updated in 2001 (often still referred to as the [...] "Acquired Rights Directive"), required that a business transferee would have to provide a good economic, technical or organisational reason if they were either to not retain all previous employees, or wanted to make detrimental variations to their workers' contracts. This means that the new employer who is a transferee of a business through an asset sale is in no better position than would be a new owner who gained control of a business by buying out a company's shares: contractual variations require the employees' consent and dismissal rights remain {{as if it were the}} old employer. As implemented by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006, a clear example where employees contracts transfer was in Litster v Forth Dry Dock. The House of Lords held that a purposive interpretation is to be given to the legislation so that where 12 dockworkers were sacked an hour before a business sale, their contracts remained in effect if the employees would <b>still</b> <b>be</b> <b>there</b> in absence of an unfair dismissal. This does not, however, mean that employees unfairly dismissed before a sale have a right to their jobs back, because national law's normal remedy remains with a preference for damages over specific performance. The same principle goes for any variation that works to the detriment of the employee. So the transferee employer may not (without a good business reason) for example, try to impose a single new gardening clause or withdraw tenure, or the employee will have a claim for constructive dismissal.|$|E
