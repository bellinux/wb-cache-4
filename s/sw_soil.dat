40|$|The dryland {{ecosystems}} of the US Desert Southwest (SW) {{are dependent}} on soil moisture for aboveground productivity; the generation of soil moisture in the SW is dependent on both soil physical properties and climate forcing. This study {{is one of the}} first regional point-scale analyses that explores the role of soil physical properties in modulating aboveground vegetation dynamics in response to climate forcing in the <b>SW.</b> <b>Soil</b> texture accounted for significant differences in average aboveground primary productivity across the SW. However, soil texture could not account for differences in inter-annual aboveground productivity variation across the SW. Subsurface soil texture was tightly coupled with precipitation seasonality in accounting for differences in long-term average seasonal aboveground productivity in the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts. The results of this study indicate that the subsurface is a significant factor in modulating aboveground primary productivity, and needs to be included in future modeling exercises of dryland ecosystem response to climate forcing and change...|$|E
40|$|Potential {{changes in}} {{cropping}} practices {{to accommodate the}} direct utilization of plant biomass {{for the production of}} second-generation cellulosic biofuels have raised concerns over unintended environmental effects. We focused on changes in: i) soil C pools, ii) N cycling capacity, and iii) microbial community structure. We hypothesized that cropping practices (e. g. plant selection, residue removal) would influence soil microbial community structure and functional capacity, altering soil C and N turnover compared to conventional agricultural practices. Replicated plots at the Purdue Water Quality Field Station (WQFS) were used in a comparative assessment of soil quality for cellulosic biofuel management and conventional systems, with surface soils sampled four times over a three-year establishment period. The biofuel systems were no-till continuous corn (Zea mays; CR), Miscanthus x giganteus (MS), tall grass prairie dominated by big bluestem (Andropogon gerardii; PR), dual-purpose sorghum (Sorghum bicolor; hybrid PU 8168 X; SG), and upland switchgrass (Panicum virgatum; c. v. Shawnee; <b>SW).</b> <b>Soil</b> C pools were evaluated by characterizing the physiochemical properties, including total organic C (TOC), permanganate oxidizable C (POXC), total nitrogen (TN), and soil pH, and the biological measures of microbial biomass using total phospholipid fatty acid - phosphate (PLFA-PO 4), microbial C utilization via basal respiration (BR), and response to glucose addition (SIR). Shifts in N cycling pathways were estimated by soil assays of dehydrogenase (DH) and urease (UR) enzyme activity, net N mineralization (NM), acetylene reduction (AR), nitrification potential (NP) and denitrification potential (DP), and by profiling the diversity of functional genes essential for nitrogen fixation (nitrogenase, nifH), nitrification (ammonia monooxygenase, amoA), and denitrification (nitrite reductase, nirK) by PCR-denaturing gradient electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE). Changes in the size and structure of the microbial community were judged by quantifying differences in PLFA signatures and by evaluating fungal diversity via PCR-DGGE targeting the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rRNA region. We observed no significant differences between systems in the TOC or POXC. However, cellulosic harvesting in CR, MS and in PR caused relative declines in BR and SIR. Based on multivariate statistical analysis of physiochemical (TOC, POXC, TN, pH) and microbial (PLFA-PO 4, SIR, BR) parameters, we highlight the strength of BR as an early predictor of changes in soil C dynamics. The N cycle was impacted by plant selection and management, showing a distinct polarization in both multivariate analysis of N transformations and composite analysis of N functional gene diversity between the minimal management in the PR system and the high intensity practices of CR. With time, SG, SW and MS developed unique N functional community structures and trended towards similarity with the PR system. We noted that residue removal from continuous corn did not alter soil enzymatic activity, but did shift functional community diversity. Evaluation of PLFA and ITS-DGGE profiles supported the overall distinction of PR, SW {{and to a lesser extent}} SG from all other cropping systems. It is clear that cropping system selection is highly influential on the soil microbial community and critical belowground C and N processes, which may influence long-term ecosystem function. The intermediate nature of dual-purpose sorghum with respect to soil C and N dynamics supports this crop as an alternative annual biomass cropping system. Furthermore, pursuit of dedicated perennial biofuels may offer an avenue to enhance agroecosystem services while supporting a bioenergy economy. ...|$|E

40|$|Plant ecologists {{have long}} been {{interested}} in aspect-related contrasts of montane forests. Few studies have assessed correlation (linkage) among vegetation strata; fewer have included soil microbial communities. This study assessed contrasts in overstory, spring herbaceous, and soil microbial communities between northeast (NE) - and southwest (SW) -facing slopes in a second-growth West Virginia hardwood forest. We addressed three questions: (1) how do soil microbial, herbaceous layer, and overstory communities vary with slope aspect? (2) do forest vegetation strata and soil microbial communities exhibit linkage? (3) do biotic relationships and linkage vary with slope aspect? Moisture, organic matter, pH, soil NO 3 -, and net nitrification were significantly higher in NE soils; soil NH 4 + was significantly higher in <b>SW</b> <b>soils,</b> and net N mineralization was virtually identical between aspects. Vegetation communities markedly differed between the slopes. Overall, 29 tree and 118 herbaceous species were encountered, with overstory dominated by sugar maple and sweet buckeye on NE slopes and white oak on SW slopes. The herb layer of the NE aspect was characterized by forbs with fewer graminoids, whereas higher diversity and importance of graminoids were typical for SW slopes. Important microbial groups for NE soils were Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria; <b>SW</b> <b>soils</b> were dominated by fungal groups and Gram-negative bacteria associated with environmental stress. Linkage was detected between soil microbes and overstory on the NE slope and between soil microbes and herb layer on the SW slope. We suggest that higher net radiation to the SW slope has created more weathered soil conditions, selecting for microbial groups both adapted to, and maintaining, low N availability (bottom-up control). This has resulted in dominance of NO 3 [1] in less weathered NE soils and NH 4 þ in more weathered <b>SW</b> <b>soils.</b> Other differences arose from contrasts in humus formation, driven by overstory species composition and maintained by soil moisture (top-down control). Higher moisture of NE soils is more conducive to humus formation, supporting different microbial communities than the SW slopes with drier and often exposed mineral soil. Thus, plants and microbes can form biotic linkages in forest ecosystems which can vary among vegetation strata and with slope aspect...|$|R

Two organic materials, green-waste compost (gw) or cocompost from sewage sludge and wood chips (sw), were mixed with sandy loam soil (40 % v/v) and placed in 600 -L containers. Containers received a 29 -cm thick layer of sandy loam soil–organic matter mix over a 28 -cm thick layer without organic amendment. Volumetric water content, dry bulk density, hydraulic conductivity at saturation and water retention were measured over 5 yrs in the soils and values for the mixes and a control compared.

40|$|Research Paper: <b>SW</b> - <b>soil</b> and WaterThis study aims at {{assessing}} {{the feasibility of}} deficit irrigation of maize, wheat and sunflower through {{an analysis of the}} economic water productivity (EWP). It focuses on selected sprinkler-irrigated fields in Vigia Irrigation District, Southern Portugal. Various scenarios of water deficits and water availability were considered. Simulations were performed for average, high and very high climatic demand. The potential crop yields were estimated from regional climatic data and local information. Using field collected data on yield values, production costs, water costs, commodity prices and irrigation performance, indicators on EWP were calculated. Results show that a main bottleneck for adopting deficit irrigation is the presently low performance of the irrigation systems used in the considered fields, which leads to high water use and low EWP. Decreasing water use through deficit irrigation also decreases the EWP. Limited water deficits for maize are likely to be viable when the irrigation performance is improved if water prices do not increase much, and the commodity price does not return to former low levels. The sunflower crop, despite lower sensitivity to water deficits than maize, {{does not appear to be}} a viable solution to replace maize when water restrictions are high; however it becomes an attractive crop if recently high commodity prices are maintained. With improved irrigation performance, wheat deficit irrigation is viable including when full water costs are applied, if former low prices are not returned to. However, under drought conditions full water costs are excessive. Thus, adopting deficit irrigation requires not only an appropriate irrigation scheduling but higher irrigation performance, and that the application of a water prices policy would be flexible, thus favouring the improvement of the irrigation system...|$|R
40|$|Research Paper: <b>SW</b> - <b>Soil</b> and WaterClimate change creates {{uncertainties}} {{for irrigation}} management. To cope with them, simulations were performed {{for the present}} and scenario-built weather conditions that include a pessimistic scenario of precipitation decrease in the next 25 years. In a former study, the irrigation scheduling simulation model ISAREG was calibrated for two maize varieties: the water stress-resistant hybrid Kn- 2 L- 611 and the water stress-sensitive hybrid H 708. Both are subjects of this study, which compares four irrigation scheduling alternatives: (1) refilling the soil reservoir and adopting a management-allowed depletion fraction (MAD) of 0. 47; (2) refilling the soil reservoir and adopting MAD ¼ 0. 33; (3) partially refilling the soil reservoir and adopting MAD ¼ 0. 47; and (4) crop without irrigation. For the very dry year and the present climate all alternative irrigation schedules behave similarly but for the average year, alternatives 1 and 3, allowing a larger soil water depletion with MAD ¼ 0. 47, require less water than the alternative with MAD ¼ 0. 33. However, analysis of impact on yields using simulations relative to every year during 1970 – 1992 shows that alternative 2 leads to less impact on yields. The results of simulations were compared with irrigation schedules presently advised {{in the region and}} show that the latter do not fully cover crop requirements in dry seasons, when some yield decrease occurs. Simulations for the pessimistic scenario show that all three irrigation scheduling alternatives can easily accommodate the foreseen changes mainly by selecting suitable irrigation dates. The results of simulations do not allow selecting one among the three alternatives as the best irrigation scheduling strategy but are useful for later building an information system for farmers using actual weather data. Relative to the rainfed crop, the results indicate that yield impacts highly increase for the pessimistic scenario, particularly for the water stresssensitive hybrid H 708. The results indicate that vulnerability to climate change is higher for non-irrigated crops and that coping with possible rainfall decreases requires adopting less sensitive crop varieties, including when deficit irrigation would be applied for water saving...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to understand how large-scale processes, cloud cover and surface fluxes affect the temperature variability over the SIRTA site, near Paris, and in a regional climate simulation performed in the frame of HyMeX/Med-CORDEX programs. This site is located in a climatic transitional area where models usually show strong dispersions despite the significant influence of large scale on interannual variability due to its western location. At seasonal time scale, the temperature is mainly controlled by surface fluxes. In the model, the transition from radiation to soil moisture limited regime occurs earlier than in observations leading to an overestimate of summertime temperature. An overestimate of shortwave radiation (SW), consistent with a lack of low clouds, enhances the soil dryness. A simulation with a wet soil is used to better analyse the relationship between dry soil and clouds but while the wetter soil leads to colder temperature, the cloud cover during daytime is not increased due to the atmospheric stability. At shorter time scales, the control of surface radiation becomes higher. In the simulation, higher temperatures are associated with higher <b>SW.</b> A wet <b>soil</b> mitigates the effect of radiation due to modulation by evaporation. In observations, the variability of clouds and their effect on SW is stronger leading to a nearly constant mean SW when sorted by temperature quantile but a stronger impact of cloud cover on day-to-day temperature variability.

40|$|Characteristics of the {{germination}} {{strategy of}} Eucalyptus salmonophloia are described, {{and whether the}} germination niche is limiting recruitment of E. salmonophloia seedlings in remnant woodlands is discussed. Germination in E. salmonophloia proceeds with favourable soil temperature and water conditions {{on a variety of}} substrates. However, at temperatures above and below the optimum for germination (25 °C), enforced dormancy occurs and germination is retarded. In these situations, dormancy is simply overcome when temperatures return to optimum. Seeds can remain moist at sub-optimum temperatures for prolonged periods without losing viability. Furthermore E. salmonophloia seeds are capable of withstanding a cycle of wetting and drying with undiminished germination capacity. Conditions suitable for germination occur {{at the beginning of the}} winter wet season in <b>SW</b> Australia when <b>soil</b> temperatures are still suitable and soil moisture and atmospheric humidity are frequently high. These germination characteristics minimize the chances of seeds germinating at times when the probability of seedling establishment is low (e. g. summer). This is particularly important because E. salmonophloia only establishes a temporary soil, seed-reserve following large scale disturbances, and therefore the opportunities for recruitment may be quite rare. In remnant woodland when ants were excluded and a soil seed-bank was created artificially, seeds germinated, but no seedlings survived. This suggests that the destruction of seeds by ants during inter-disturbance periods is having little effect on recruitment because seedlings are unlikely to establish. Unfavourable conditions for germination are unlikely to be responsible for the lack of E. salmonophloia seedling recruitment in remnant woodlands. Further research is needed to identify the factors critical for seedling establishment; changes in resource availability following large-scale disturbances and associated tree death are important in this respect...|$|R

The soil temperature was measured in each node of the grid and {{used to evaluate the}} heat flow. The heat flow data were also analyzed by sequential Gaussian simulations. Heat flow from steam vents and fractures was determined by quantifying the amount of steam emitted from the vents by direct measurements of steam flow rate. The heat loss from the steam heated mud pools was determined by quantifying the rate of heat loss from the pools by evaporation, convection, and radiation. The steam flow rate into the pools was calculated from the observed heat loss from the pools, assuming that steam flow was the only mechanism of heat transport into the pool. The CO 2 emissions from the steam vents and mud pools were determined by multiplying the steam flow rate from the respective sources by the representative CO 2 concentration of steam in the Reykjanes area. The observed rates of CO 2 emissions through soil, steam vents, and steam heated mud pools amounted to 13. 5 ± 1. 7, 0. 23 ± 0. 05, and 0. 13 ± 0. 03 tons per day, respectively. The heat flow through soil, steam vents, and mud pools was 16. 9 ± 1. 4, 2. 2 ± 0. 4, and 1. 2 ± 0. 1 MW, respectively. Heat loss from the geothermal reservoir, inferred from the CO 2 emissions through the soil amounts to 130 ± 16 MW of thermal energy. The discrepancy between the observed heat loss and the heat loss inferred from the CO 2 emissions is attributed to steam condensation in the subsurface due to interactions with cold ground water. These results demonstrate that soil diffuse degassing can be a more reliable proxy for heat loss from geothermal systems than soil temperatures. The soil diffuse degassing at Reykjanes appears to be strongly controlled by the local tectonics. The observed diffuse degassing defines 3 – 5 elongated N–S trending zones (000 – 020). The orientation of the diffuse degassing structures at Reykjanes is consistent with reported trends of right lateral strike slip faults in the area.

Incubation experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of vertical soil moisture distribution patterns on diurnal variation of N 2 O emissions. Clear diurnal patterns of N 2 O emissions on both surface watering (SW) and subsurface watering (SUW) treatments (SUW 12, SUW 15, and SUW 18) were detected from soil sample (I), silty clay, and soil sample (II), sandy loam, where peak N 2 O fluxes usually occurred between 12 : 00 and 18 : 00 h. Different vertical watering patterns resulted in changes in the daily range of N 2 O fluxes and peak time. Mean fluxes from the SUW 12, SUW 15, and SUW 18 treatments were 37. 4 %, 32. 7 %, and 43. 3 % lower than those from <b>SW</b> treatments from <b>soil</b> sample I, and 32. 0 %, 40. 3 %, and 41. 1 % from soil sample II. Moisture distribution patterns under SUW soils could be effective to mitigate N 2 O emissions.

The different soil texture and N content level might account for the differences in magnitude of N 2 O fluxes from soils. The optimal soil moisture condition for peak N 2 O fluxes in the SW treatment had relatively narrower ranges than the SUW treatments with 46 % to 60 % water-filled pore space (WFPS) for soil sample I and 26 % to 34 % WFPS for soil sample II even though surface soil moisture for peak N 2 O fluxes were somewhat different from the previously reported optimal soil moisture range of 45 % to 75 % WFPS...|$|R
40|$|EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify which physical properties impact the thermal resistivity dry-out curve (TRDC) of natural sandy soils. The TRDC is a relationship between soil thermal resistivity and degree of wetness (e. g., volumetric water content, gravimetric water content, or degree of saturation). TRDCs of 13 sandy soils were investigated using modified hanging column tests. The tests were also used to investigate co-effects of the soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC), which represents the hydraulic properties of unsaturated soil. The physical properties evaluated in this research included: (1) degree of saturation, (2) soil particle size (D 10 and D 50), (3) fines content, (4) soil type, (5) soil density (?dmax, emax, and emin) and gradation (Cu), (6) quartz content, and (7) particle shape (sphericity and roundness). In the TRDCs, three analysis points?thermal resistivity (?) at the fully dried condition, critical degree of saturation, and fully saturated condition?were selected for analysis. Correlations between the three points of interest on the TRDC and the physical properties were supported with high-resolution images obtained by synchrotron X-ray computed tomography (CT) and statistical analysis, including, ANOVA and stepwise regression. Results included the significant effects of the measured soil physical parameters on the TRDC in addition to the well-recognized parameter of degree of saturation as reported in the literature. Impacts of degree of saturation on the TRDC were related to thermal resistivity of three phases of soil systems (?solid, ?liquid, and ?air). Due to high ?air, the highest ?soil was observed at the fully dried condition. As degree of saturation increases, thin films and liquid bridges among soil particles are formed, resulting in a rapid decrease in thermal resistivity. Near the critical degree of saturation of a TRDC, which is located near the knee point of the SWCC where moisture exists as adsorbed films (McQueen and Miller, 1977), changes in ?soil are more rapid. After liquid bridges form, ?soil decreases gradually as degree of saturation increases. The lowest ?soil was measured at the saturated condition. Soil thermal resistivity also decreased with increase in particle size as evaluated by D 10 and D 50. This was primarily related to size and thermal resistivity of the solid phase. In high-resolution images, for example, larger solid particles provide larger heat transfer paths, while smaller solid particles (e. g., silt-sized) consist of smaller heat transfer paths with a more tortuous void structure. Consequently, ?soil was affected by particle size as related to the thermal resistivity of the solid and void phases in addition to the tortuosity of the matrix. In contrast, ?soil increased with increasing fines content. Reasons for the effect of fines were similar to those of particle size. At a constant void ratio, soil that included higher fines content, such as SM soils, had relatively small solid particles with tortuous voids compared with SP or <b>SW</b> <b>soils,</b> which do not include significant fines content. Smaller solid particles and tortuous voids led to a decrease in ?soil. In the modified hanging column test and ANOVA, thermal resistivity values of the 13 sandy soils were unaffected by the type of sandy soil regardless of the point of comparison. Parallel with laboratory tests, statistical analyses indicate that slight differences among soil types are not statistically significant regardless of the point of interest evaluated. At the dried, critical, and saturated condition, statistical significance by soil types per ANOVA were 0. 061, 0. 174, and 0. 268. Therefore, a larger database of soil that represents the full spectrum of gravel, silt, and clay is required to fully investigate the effect of soil type on the TRDC. The effect of soil density on TRDC was analyzed using four density parameters: (a) maximum dry unit weight (?dmax), (b) minimum void ratio (emin), (c) maximum void ratio (emax), and (d) coefficient of uniformity (Cu). Soil thermal resistivity decreased as ?dmax and Cu increased, while soil thermal resistivity increased with increasing emin and emax. In other words, ?soil decreased as soil density increased because of closer particle contacts and a reduction of the volume of air. On the other hand, ?soil increased with increase in emin and emax, which represent a decrease in soil density, due to less particle contacts and greater air volume. Because quartz is amongst the best heat conducting minerals that is common in natural soils (Winterkorn, 1962), influence of quartz content on the TRDC was analyzed. Soil thermal resistivity at each of the points of comparison (dry, critical, and saturated) decreased as quartz content increased. Effect of particle shape on TRDC was analyzed based on sphericity and roundness of particles. Higher thermal resistivity was measured for prismoidal particle shapes as compared to spherical particle shapes. Soil packing with prismoidal particle shape included more voids than soil packing with spherical particle shape. Roundness of the 13 specimens ranged between 1. 08 (well-rounded shape) and 1. 13 (rounded shape). Soil thermal resistivity increased slightly with increasing roundness because moisture adsorption is enhanced when particle shape changes from a well-rounded shape to a rounded shape (Likos and Jaafar, 2013). In stepwise regression, D 10 was the only significant factor in terms of ?sat, and D 50 was only significant factor in terms of ?dry. The regression model for ?sat and ?dry resulted in R 2 of 0. 245 (24. 5 %) and 0. 519 (51. 9 %), respectively. To investigate further statistical significance among the physical properties, a greater database of measurements for the TRDCs of sandy soils would be required. In comparing thermal resistivity with paramaters from the van Genuchten (VG) model, thermal resistivity increased slightly with the ? and n parameters, both of which are indicative of the shape of SWCC. However, one of the correlations?dry thermal resistivity to the ? parameter?decreased with the two SWCC parameters. Because of similar physical properties, however, increases in thermal resistivity were small. Therefore, additional tests with an expanded database of soils?including gravel, sand, silt, and clay?is recommended to more fully investigate the correlation between thermal resistivity and the VG parameters. Among the three points of analysis on the TRDC of the 13 sandy soils, ?soil at the fully dried condition was most affected by soil physical properties; to be specific, the dry thermal resistivity values ranged from about 150 ?C?cm/W to about 330 ?C?cm/W. Heat transfer in unsaturated soil systems directly depends on the matrix of solid particles and air voids, with large differences in resulting thermal resistivity. In contrast, thermal resistivity of the 13 specimens in terms of the physical properties changed only slightly at fully and partially saturated conditions (?soil ranged from about 40 ?C?cm/W to about 80 ?C?cm/W). These findings indicate that degree of saturation, particularly dry of the critical saturation, is the most significant factor for thermal resistivity of sandy soils with similar physical properties. A larger range of soil types with varying gravel content and percentage of coarse- and fine-sized sand is required to fully investigate the effect of soil physical properties on the TRDC at partially and fully saturated conditions...|$|R

O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar o efeito de níveis crescentes de calcário na produção de mudas de pau-de-balsa. Os tratamentos foram constituídos de doses crescentes de corretivo e equivaleram a 0, 0; 0, 25; 0, 5; 0, 75; 1, 0; 1, 5 e 2, 0 t ha- 1 de calcário e o delineamento experimental utilizado foi o de blocos casualizados com cinco repetições. As características avaliadas foram: altura da planta; diâmetro do colo, matéria seca da parte aérea, matéria seca total, relação raiz/parte aérea, teores totais de macronutrientes nas plantas (N, P, K, Ca, Mg e S). Os resultados demonstraram que a prática de calagem como fator de correção do solo usado no substrato favoreceu todas as características de crescimento avaliadas na produção de mudas de pau-de-balsa. A correção do solo influenciou positivamente a absorção de Ca, Mg e S, por outro lado, não apresentou efeitos estatisticamente significativos para a absorção de N, P e K.

40|$|The {{fact that}} {{expansive}} soils {{are a major}} engineering problem makes their study an important research aspect due to the accruing cost involved {{in terms of economic}} loss when construction is undertaken without due consideration to the probability of their presence. Though there are several methods that have been used to recognise their presence a need of a fast and relatively cheaper methods continues to be a necessary undertaking. In this thesis new methods are explored where the various aspects of swelling soil properties are investigated consisting of engineering, geophysical, reflectance spectroscopy and remote sensing where data from two study areas one in central Kenya and the other insouthern Spain were used. The study relied on the establishment of indicator spectral parameters as to the presence of three clay minerals commonly used in soil classification to swelling potential classes namely; smectites, illites and kaolinites. This was through several reflectance spectra analysis techniques among which are; absorption feature mapping, derivative analysis, optical density and band normalised with centre. This was followed by the establishment of correlations between these parameters and the commonly used physicochemical indices of Atterberg limits, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), Saturated Paste (SP), and Coefficient of Linear Extensibility (COLE) tests. In this, their widely accepted thresholds within which soils are assigned to a swelling potential class and provisionally to a dominant clay mineral were used. This was followed by analysis of airborne hyperspectral data, in the Spain case and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) image data for the Kenyan study area to establish similar compositional differences. In both cases the lower spectral information content was taken into consideration where not only the spectral characteristics were used but also the surface expression of the soil compositional differences in the Kenyan area in the form of gilgai microrelief. This information was integrated with field based data consisting of topography, drainage and vegetation differences and correlations with field based soil classification maps to establish the potential of remote sensing in the mapping of swelling potential. Finally a prove of concept as to the poten tial discrimination of swelling soils under buried non-swelling soils was also expl ored where two geophysical methods consisting of Induced Polarisation (IP) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) known to give indication as to the CEC, moisture and clay mineralogy differences were used at a laboratory scale with the aim of identifying the problems to be overcome for such methods to be applicab le in a field setting where they would provide faster ways of establishing the swelling potential characteristics {{based on the fact that}} these soil properties are the key to their swelling behaviour. From the engineering methods, three of the indices were established to best represent the potential volume change and cons isted of those directly related to the clay mineralogy type i. e. CEC and the Atterberg limits of liquid limit and plastic index. This was interpreted to show th em as most suited from an engineering perspective in the identification of <b>sw</b> elling <b>soils</b> and as best suited at the exploration as to other methods capability at identifying these soils. The absorption feature mapping technique est ablished several feature parameters to be diagnostic as to the dominance of th ese minerals in soils where significant presence of kaolinite enhanced the hydroxy l features whereas substantial amounts of smectite enhanced molecular water f eatures. Manipulations of the spectral curves in the form of first and second derivatives were also observed to give similar information whereas other manipula tions such as the optical density and the band normalised with centre were not as pr omising. The potential of spectral data to discriminate the soils based on the clay mineralogy differences was thus concluded to show spectroscopy to have a potential at mapping swelling soils an assumption that was finally confirmed thr ough correlations between the spectral parameters and the established swelling pot ential indices. This was also confirmed based on spectral information from the hype rspectral image data where derivatives established several wavelength positions to give strong indications of such a potential. Landsat image data on the other hand a dded a new dimension to the potential identification and mapping of swelling soils other than the spectral differences in the form of recognition of gilgai topogr aphy pattern exclusively present in these soils. This provides a possibility of carrying out more detailed analysis of the potential differences among the swelling soils where spatial analysis of the gilgai patterns in the form of parameters such as homogeneity index can be used to relate soils in different regions based on the similarity of such indices and their association to environmental factors. This when coupled with spectral differences in the form of such indices as the soil br ightness index were established capable in assigning soils in the Kenyan study area to swell potential categories upon integration with other field based information such as topography and drainage patterns coupled with land cover differe nces. The geophysical methods (IP and NMR) though laboratory based were also established as potentially useful in the study of these soils and could be useful in their recognition in places where they could be buried based on good correlations obtained between the normalized IP and the CEC on the one hand and moisture and grain size distributions and the NMR parameters on the other. Howeve r, for the two methods to become operational there are some factors that require to be addressed one of which is the influence of salinity on the obtained IP and a proper calibration of the NMR to measure the various properties on which it has a potential to give information on. Reflectance spectroscopy was therefore conc luded to have a potential application in swelling soil identification and to offe r a fast non-destructive method based on diagnostic spectral features. Low spectral but high spatial resolution images were found useful in the recognition of these soils and to offer a potentially important tool for the comparison of the soils over wide areas through the established gilgai pattern analysis based on their expressi on of underlying forces resulting from differential swelling. Geophys ical methods of NMR and IP were also established to have a potential to non-intrusive identifica tion of these soils if some influencing factors could be overcome. Conclusions were therefore drawn that though soil swelling is a complex phenomenon invol ving several underlying factors i. e. compositional differences, structure and moisture regime etc, clay mineralogy plays a central role in determining it and thus has an overall controlling influence to most of the soil properties making th eir use in its estimation possible. The research however established that there are still more handles to be overcome as to the full operation of these new techniques...|$|R
