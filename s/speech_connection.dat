To evaluate connection level network parameters such as call drop ratio, rejected handover ratio or channel utilization the residual call holding time of han- dover connections is needed.

40|$|A {{method and}} device for extrapolating past signal-history data for {{insertion}} into missing data segments {{in order to}} conceal digital speech frame errors. The extrapolation method uses past-signal history that is stored in a buffer. The method is implemented with a device that utilizes a finite-impulse response (FIR) multi-layer feed-forward artificial neural network that is trained by back-propagation for one-step extrapolation of speech compression algorithm (SCA) parameters. Once a <b>speech</b> <b>connection</b> has been established, the speech compression algorithm device begins sending encoded speech frames. As the speech frames are received, they are decoded and converted back into speech signal voltages. During the normal decoding process, pre-processing of the required SCA parameters will occur and the results stored in the past-history buffer. If a speech frame is detected to be lost or in error, then extrapolation modules are executed and replacement SCA parameters are generated and sent as the parameters required by the SCA. In this way, the information transfer to the SCA is transparent, and the SCA processing continues as usual. The listener will not normally notice that a speech frame has been lost because of the smooth transition between the last-received, lost, and next-received speech frames...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{discuss the}} way we {{perceive}} {{the quality of a}} speech signal and how different degradations contribute to the overall perceived speech (listening) quality. More specifically, ITU-T Recommendation P. 862 (perceptual evaluation of speech quality-PESQ), which provides a perceptual modeling approach with which the subjectively perceived speech quality can be predicted, is used {{as a starting point for}} a degradation decomposition algorithm. This algorithm decomposes the perceived degradation into three different contributions by finding specific degradation indicators that quantify the impact of each type of degradation separately. The first degradation indicator quantifies the impact of additive noise as found in many speech-processing situations, such as when unwanted background noise is sent over a voice connection. The second degradation indicator quantifies the impact of linear timeinvariant frequency response distortions as. for example, introduced by a band-limited telephone system. The last degradation indicator quantifies the impact of the time-varying behavior of the system under test. This time response degradation indicator quantifies the impact of temporal signal loss, as found with packet loss in modern digital <b>speech</b> <b>connections,</b> and the impact of pulses (clicks) as found in many speech-processing systems...|$|R

40|$|Digital Enhanced Radio Telecommunications (DECT) is {{a general}} radio access {{technology}} for short range wireless telecommunications. It provides telephony quality voice services and {{a broad range of}} data services. Packet Radio Multiple Access (PRMA) is a variation of r-Aloha technique adjusted to use for speech services. Basic DECT system does not discriminate between kind of data it transmits and does not adjust its behaviour to existing conditions. Indeed, DECT uses circuit switched commutation to establish a connection independently form data type. In this paper a characteristics of speech transmission is taken into account and improvement of DECT is discussed. The circuit switched network for voice transmission utilizes effectively about 40 % of channel capacity, as people listen for approximately half of phone call time and only during the other half, they produce [1]. This results in wasting radio resources, because a signal comprising ‘silence ’ is being transmitted. The idea of applying a packet transmission into DECT radio interface facilitates maintenance of the <b>speech</b> <b>connection</b> only when speech signal is available to be sent. The investigations in applying the PRMA into DECT has show that the substantial gain can be achieved. This paper discusses the concept of applying PRMA to DECT and disseminates the simulation results...|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{analysis}} of the emergence and development of written speech, its relationship to the oral <b>speech,</b> <b>connections</b> to the symbolic and modeling activities of preschool children – playing and drawing. While a child's drawing is traditionally interpreted in psychology either as a measure of intellectual development, or as a projective technique, or as a criterion for creative giftedness of the child, in this article, the artistic activity is analyzed as a prerequisite for development of written speech. The article substantiates the hypothesis that the mastery of “picture writing” – the ability to display the verbal content in a schematic picturesque plan – is connected to the success of writing speech at school age. Along with the classical works of L. S. Vygotsky, D. B. Elkonin, A. R. Luria, dedicated to finding the origins of writing, the article presents the current Russian and foreign frameworks of forming the preconditions of writing, based on the concepts of cultural-historical theory (“higher mental functions”, “zone of proximal development”, etc.). In Western psychology, a number of pilot studies used the developmental function of drawing for teaching the written skills to children of 5 - 7 years old. However, in cognitive psychology, relationship between drawing and writing is most often reduced mainly to the analysis of general motor circuits. Despite the recovery in research on writing and its origins in the last decade, either in domestic or in foreign psychology, the written speech is not a sufficiently studied problem...|$|R

This fact may be explained at least partially by the ability of the Jensen-Renyi divergence and the mutual information to utilize temporal dependence structure, which puts these two criteria ahead of the Rényi generalized divergence and its special cases of the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the log maximum ratio, which we considered as alternatives.|$|R

We collected 4.9 million tweets of 18, 450 users and their contact network from August 2016 to November 2016. We defined six user classes regarding their sentiment towards Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton: whatever, Trump supporter, Hillary supporter, positive, neutral, and negative. Next, we analyzed their political homophily in three scenarios. Firstly, we analyzed the Twitter follow, mention and retweet connections either unidirectional and reciprocal. In the second scenario, we analyzed multiplex connections, and in the third one, we analyzed friendships with similar speeches. Our results showed that negative users, users supporting Trump, and users supporting Hillary had homophily in all analyzed scenarios.
