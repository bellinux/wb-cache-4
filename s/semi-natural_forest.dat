In accordance with that, available data concerning the state of fungi in Serbia are scarce. The aim of this work was to collect all relevant unpublished data considering fungi in Fruška Gora and to present checklist of two fungal phyla: Myxomycota and Ascomycota. In the presented checklist, 23 recorded species of Myxomycota (known as fungal analogues) were distributed in 2 classes, 5 orders, and 7 families.

Association between J. excelsa and other plant species and environmental variables were analyzed using Fisher exact probability tests and stepwise discriminant analysis, High attitude (> 1000 m) as a proxy for an Oromediterranean climate, and high surface stoniness as a proxy for low competition by other tree species, are positive site properties for J. excelsa, The tree species avoids Eumediterranean and Supramediterranean plant communities.

The forestry literature reports that tree-size distribution trajectories vary across different stands and/or species, while the metabolic scaling theory suggests that the tree number scales universally as - 2 power of diameter. Here, we propose a simple functional scaling model in which these two opposing results are reconciled. Basic principles related to crown shape, energy optimization and the finite size scaling approach were used to define a set of relationships based on a single parameter, which allows us to predict the slope of the tree-size distributions in a steady state condition. We tested the model predictions on four temperate mountain forests. Plots (4 ha each, fully mapped) were selected with different degrees of human disturbance (semi-natural stands vs. formerly managed).

It benefits urban communities environmentally, esthetically, recreationally and economically. Beijing Province is in north of China, and has a total area of 16, 807. 8 km(2) and a population of about 13. 8 million. This paper aims to develop a comprehensive conceptual framework for urban greening of Beijing Province based on landscape ecological principles. It attempts to answer how to establish an urban greening plan at the regional, city and neighborhood levels to achieve long-term sustainability. At the regional level, a big natural and <b>semi-natural</b> <b>forest</b> area in the northwest and an ecological buffer belt in the southeast are planned to protect the environmental quality of Beijing and provide habitats for wildlife. At the city level, a green network system of green wedges, parks and green corridors has been proposed. This green network helps to limit future urban expansion, improve urban environmental quality and serve as habitats and migration routes for wildlife. At the neighborhood level, green extensions and connections of riverside greenway, road greenway, parks and vertical greening permeate into the built-up areas. They provide open space close to residential areas and offer places for recreation. This three-level green system constitutes an integrated ecological network for urban sustainable development of Beijing. For future development of Beijing, urban parks, forestry, agriculture, water and infrastructure should be planned and designed in an integrated way. After this greenspace plan is legislated and completely realized, Beijing will develop an interconnected and integrated network of urban greenspaces. It has the prospect of achieving the aim of "Green Olympic City 2008 " and the long-term goal of developing Beijing towards an "Eco-City". (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that shading by riparian vegetation may reduce maximum water temperature and provide refugia for temperature sensitive aquatic organisms. Longitudinal cooling gradients have been observed during the daytime for stream reaches shaded by coniferous trees downstream of clear cuts, or deciduous woodland downstream of open moorland. However, {{little is known about the}} energy exchange processes that drive such gradients, especially in semi-natural woodland contexts, and in the absence of potentially confounding cool groundwater inflows. To address this gap, this study quantified and modelled variability in stream temperature and heat fluxes along an upland reach of the Girnock Burn (a tributary of the Aberdeenshire Dee, Scotland) where riparian landuse transitions from open moorland to <b>semi-natural</b> <b>forest.</b> Observations were made along a 1050 m reach using a spatially-distributed network of ten water temperature micro-loggers, three automatic weather stations and > 200 hemispherical photographs, which were used to estimate incoming solar radiation. These data parameterised a high-resolution energy flux model, incorporating flow-routing, which predicted spatio-temporal variability in stream temperature. Variability in stream temperature was controlled largely by energy fluxes at the water column–atmosphere interface. Predominantly net energy gains occurred along the reach during daylight hours, and heat exchange across the bed-water column interface accounted for 1 h. Temperature gradients were not generated by cooling of stream water, but rather by a combination of reduced rates of heating in the woodland reach and advection of cooler (overnight and early morning) water from the upstream moorland catchment. Longitudinal thermal gradients were indistinct at night and on days when net radiation gains were low (under over-cast skies), thus when changes in net energy gains or losses did not vary significantly in space and time, and heat advected into the reach was reasonably consistent. The findings of the study and the modelling approach employed are useful tools for assessing optimal planting strategies for mitigating against ecologically damaging stream temperature maxima...|$|E

40|$|At {{a global}} scale the area devoted to {{agricultural}} cultivation that depends upon insect pollination has grown steadily and, therefore, an increased demand of this service would be expected. However, lack of pollinators is not always an essential factor in the productive system at farm level. The present work evaluates the perceptions of passion fruit (Passiflora edulis) producers about the main factors determining their productivity in three Colombian departments (Huila, Meta and Valle del Cauca). In Valle, pollination is manually applied to complement insect pollination, and cultivation areas are more isolated from natural or <b>semi-natural</b> <b>forests,</b> have a higher density and are subjected to more frequent pesticide application than in Huila and Meta. In Meta, cultivation depends exclusively on bee (Xylocopa) pollination, density of cultivated lots is lower, plots are more isolated from natural/semi-natural habitat, and pesticide are applied with a lower frequency. Eventual interventions to insure the provision of natural pollination services would differ. For instance, in Valle and Huila the probability that producers will adopt the concept of pollination services to justify habitat conservation is low, given the intensification level observed. In order to improve the level of natural pollination services supplied for passion fruit culture in these localities, organic production schemes must be promoted, and/or small habitat fringes close to the cultivation areas be restore...|$|R

It was observed that canola fields of southern Brazil are surrounded by a homogeneous landscape dominated by agricultural areas. The survey of bees detected a low abundance and richness of native bees in contrast to the high abundance of Apis mellifera. Except for a negative correlation between the abundance of honey bees and the proportion of forested areas within a 2000 m radius from the field (R = - 0. 90; P = 0. 012), no other correlations were found among bee abundance and richness and landscape composition. Although there was not a relationship between A. mellifera and seed set, there was a positive correlation between insect density and seed weight per plant (R = 0. 87; P = 0. 024). As honey bees were the most captured insect (79 %), much of the pollination in this system was probably achieved by honey bees...|$|R
