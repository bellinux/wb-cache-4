50|$|Ever {{since the}} first balloon ascent by the Montgolfier Brothers in 1783, it had been {{realised}} that for balloons to be really useful, {{they had to be}} navigable. Patrick Alexander applied his mind to this problem of airship propulsion. In 1893 and 1894 he filed a number of patents. His ideas included reciprocating oars and an adjustable-pitch propeller that resembled a pair of fans. One patent includes a means of heating the gas in the balloon envelope by using piped steam, the steam pipe also served to support the balloon in the <b>shape</b> of a <b>parachute</b> in the event of the balloon being burst or punctured.

50|$|In 1838 he {{developed}} a balloon that if ruptured or deflated when aloft would collapse to form a parachute (the bottom half would fold upwards into the top half to form the classic <b>parachute</b> <b>shape)</b> which would allow the occupants of the basket to descend without injury or loss of life. Although the idea was not original, Wise {{was the first to}} build a working version and the first to demonstrate its use. On a flight from Easton, Pennsylvania, on August 11, 1838, in bad weather, the design was put to an impromptu test when Wise's balloon was punctured at 13,000 feet. In less than ten seconds all the gas had escaped. The balloon descended rapidly with an oscillating motion, and, on reaching the earth, rebounded, throwing Wise ten feet from the car. Wise survived without injury. He later advertised that on October 1, 1838 he would ascend and in the air would convert his balloon into a parachute, which feat he successfully accomplished.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} to Professor Roland Glowinski for his 70 th birthday Abstract. A spring model is applied to simulate the skeleton structure of the red blood cell (RBC) membrane and to study the red blood cell (RBC) rheology in microvessels. The biconcave RBC shape in static plasma and tank-treading behavior of single cell in shear flows have been successfully captured in this model. The behavior of the RBC in a Poiseuille flow and the lateral migration of the cells in a shear flow have been investigated. It is found that the RBCs exhibit <b>parachute</b> <b>shape</b> in a Poiseuille flow with the curvature {{closely related to the}} deformability of the cell membrane and the hematocrit (Hct) of the blood. With this spring model, RBCs can recover their initial shapes associated with the minimal elastic energy when the flow stops. The simulation results also show that the RBCs migrate {{to the center of the}} domain in the radial direction in a shear flow, which clearly indicates the Fahraeus-Lindqvist effect in microvessels. The rate of migration toward the center depends on the shape of the RBC; the bioconcave shape enhences this migration...|$|R
40|$|Red {{blood cells}} (RBCs) {{are the most}} common type of cells in human blood and they exhibit {{different}} types of motions and deformed shapes in capillary flows. The behaviour of the RBCs should be studied in order to explain the RBC motion and deformation mechanism. This article presents a numerical simulation method for RBC deformation in microvessels. A two dimensional spring network model is used to represent the RBC membrane, where the elastic stretch/compression energy and the bending energy are considered with the constraint of constant RBC surface area. The forces acting on the RBC membrane are obtained from the principle of virtual work. The whole fluid domain is discretized into a finite number of particles using smoothed particle hydrodynamics concepts and the motions of all the particles are solved using Navier [...] Stokes equations. Minimum energy concepts are used to simulate the deformed shape of the RBC model. To verify the model, the motion of a single RBC is simulated in a Poiseuille flow and the characteristic <b>parachute</b> <b>shape</b> of the RBC is observed.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{mechanical}} relaxation behavior of human {{red blood cells}} by observing the time evolution of shape change of cells flowing through microchannels with abrupt constrictions. We observe two types of relaxation processes. In the first fast process (tau(1) similar to 200 ms) the initially <b>parachute</b> <b>shaped</b> cells relax into cup-shaped cells (stomatocytes). These cells relax and reorient in a second relaxation process with a response time of tau(1 / 2) similar to 10 s into the equilibrium discoid shapes. The values for the relaxation times of single red blood cells in the population scatter significantly within the cell population between 0. 11 s < tau(1) < 0. 52 s and 9 s < tau(1 / 2) < 49 s, respectively. However, when plotting tau(1 / 2) against tau(1), we find a linear {{relationship between the two}} timescales and are able to relate both to the elastic properties of the spectrin cytoskeleton underlying the red cell's plasma membrane. Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) enhances dissociation of spectrin filaments resulting in a reduced shear modulus. We modify the cytoskeleton connectivity by depletion and repletion of ATP and study the effect on relaxation. Both the linear relationship of timescales as well as the ATP dependence can be understood by theoretical models. ...|$|R
40|$|Spacecraft parachutes are {{typically}} used in multiple stages, {{starting with a}} "reefed" stage where a cable along the parachute skirt constrains the diameter {{to be less than}} the diameter in the subsequent stage. After {{a certain period of time}} during the descent, the cable is cut and the parachute "disreefs" (i. e. expands) to the next stage. Computing the <b>parachute</b> <b>shape</b> at the reefed stage and fluid–-structure interaction (FSI) modeling during the disreefing involve computational challenges beyond those we have in FSI modeling of fully-open spacecraft parachutes. These additional challenges are created by the increased geometric complexities and by the rapid changes in the parachute geometry. The computational challenges are further increased because of the added geometric porosity of the latest design, where the "windows" created by the removal of panels and the wider gaps created by the removal of sails compound the geometric and flow complexity. Orion spacecraft main parachutes will have three stages, with computation of the Stage 1 shape and FSI modeling of disreefing from Stage 1 to Stage 2 being the most challenging. We present the special modeling techniques we devised to address the computational challenges and the results from the computations carried out. We also present the methods we devised to calculate for a parachute gore the radius of curvature in the circumferential direction.

40|$|The {{main focus}} of the thesis was to study and {{understand}} why human RBC change their shape upon increasing shear stress in the microvasculatur. Therefore, human RBCs were observed while flowing in PDMS micro-channels of different structures (even structure, corner structure, spiral structure and zig-zag structure) and tapered glass capillaries. This allowed {{for the study of}} RBC morphology upon various levels of flow conditions or shear stress, respectively. Besides the study of the flow behaviour under various flow conditions various types of RBCs were investigated. The following mammalian red blood cells (RBCs) were investigated: healthy human RBCs, chemically modified RBCs as a model system for blood diseases, RBCs suffering from b-Thalassemia and Spherocytosis as well as RBCs from Alpaca (vicugna pacos). The chemical modification was performed by incubating healthy RBCs in suspensions of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with a small concentration of either formaline, diamide or cholesterol. The chemicals formaline and diamide hardened the cell membrane and cholesterol changed the strain inside the RBC membrane. To characterize the RBC mechanics quantitatively the following physical parameters were used: bending modulus, shearing modulus, area expansion modulus and the transition velocity. First, cell morphology in flow was investigated regarding length and curvature measurements of the two-dimensional cell projection (for example length to width ratio or front and rear curvature). For each cell type the discocyte, slipper and <b>parachute</b> <b>shape</b> was measured regarding width to length ratios and protuberances-length ratios as well as front and rear curvatures. A detailed study of the healthy, chemically modified and diseased shape morphology showed that chemically modified and diseased cells had a different shape and size compared to healthy RBCs. The variations of the measured two-dimensional projection ratios and curvatures showed a correlation to alterations in the cell membrane. Second, in flow systems the mechanical properties were investigated dynamically. While the cells were exposed to a constant hydrodynamic flow field their deformation was measured. The Taylor deformation parameter varied proportionally to changes in mechanical properties of the RBCs. Chemically modified RBCs showed a smoother increase of the Taylor deformation with increasing cell velocity and saturated at lower Taylor deformation levels. Modifications of the RBCs with diamide and formaline incubations decreased the Taylor deformation parameter for the measured flow regimes dramatically. This supported the results from the static measurements. However, the Taylor deformation parameter did not indicate shape changes of RBCs (such as discocyte to slipper or parachute) which were observed upon increasing shear stress. Third, using PDMS micro channels the shape transition from the discocytic rest shape to a slipper or <b>parachute</b> <b>shape</b> of RBCs was characterized further. In a 10 x 10 µm (width and height) channel the transition velocities v_c of hundreds of RBCs for different volume flows were measured. It was found that the transition velocity solely depends on mechanical properties of the RBC membrane. Formaline and diamide modifications increased the transition velocity by a factor of about two to three. Low cholesterol content in the membrane as well as high tonicity of the suspension medium increased the transition velocity weakly. In contrast, high cholesterol content and low medium tonicity decreased the transition velocity. Cells from donors with the blood disease b-Thalassemia showed an increase of the transition velocity of around 25...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge of {{vertical}} air motions {{in the atmosphere}} is important for meteorological and climate studies due to its impact on clouds, precipitation and the vertical transport of air masses, heat, momentum, and composition. It {{is among the most}} difficult quantities to measure because of its small magnitude. In this study, a descending radiosonde technique has been developed to detect the vertical wind speed (VW) in the atmosphere. The system is composed of a radiosonde and a 0. 5 -m diameter hard ball made of plastic foam that acts as a parachute. The radiosonde hangs under the hard ball by a string which is then cut when the instrument is elevated into the upper troposphere by a balloon. The VW is derived from the difference between the observed radiosonde descent rate and the calculated radiosonde descent rate in still air based on fluid dynamics. Deduction of the appropriate drag coefficient for the radiosonde is facilitated by the symmetrical <b>shape</b> of the <b>parachute.</b> An intensive radiosonde launch experiment was held in northern China during the summer seasons of 2010 to 2012. This study uses radiosonde data collected during the campaign to retrieve the vertical air velocity within the radiosonde altitude-detecting range. In general, the VW ranges from − 1 to 1 m s − 1. Strong vertical air motion (~ 2 m s − 1) is seen in a few radiosonde measurements. Although considerable uncertainties exist in measuring weak vertical air motions, a case study shows that there is reasonable agreement between retrievals of VW in the lower atmosphere from the radiosonde and a wind profiler radar located at the launch site...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{shows how}} water and ice can enable exceptionally simple ways to construct structures in deep space. Practicality is underscored by applying advanced tank methods being developed for Mars missions. Water or ice {{is now known}} to be present or abundant on most objects in the solar system, starting with the planet Mercury. Thermal processes alone {{can be used to}} melt ice. The cold of space can refreeze water back into ice. The anomalous low vapor pressure of water, about 7 mm Hg, permits bladder containers. Tanks or bladders made with modern polymer fiber and film can exhibit very small (< 0. 1 %) equivalent tankage and ullage fractions and thus hold thousands of tons of water per ton bladder. Injecting water into a bladder whose shape when inflated is the desired final shape, such as a space vehicle, provides a convenient way to construct large structures. In space, structures of 1 O,OOO-T mass become feasible because the bladder mass is low enough to be launched. The bladder can weigh 1 OOO times less than its contents, or 10 T. The bladder would be packed like a <b>parachute.</b> <b>Shaped</b> memory materials and/or gas inflation could reestablish the desired structure shape after unpacking. The water comes from space resources. An example examines construction of torus space vehicle with 100 -m nominal dimension. People would live inside the torus.

In microfluidic devices or in microcirculation, they flow through channels of different dimensions where they must adapt their motion and deformation. Membrane mechanics is then a key factor. An interesting situation is the flow of a capsule from a narrow to a wide channel. At the junction, the adverse pressure gradient compresses the particle in the streamwise direction and expands it crosswise. The distance between the capsule and the channel wall may become small, leading to contact and eventually adhesion. Cells clusters downstream of a sudden expansion (e. g. filter) has been observed. The aim of the present study is to analyze the dynamics of a bioartificial capsule when it exits a cylindrical pore as a function of different system parameters: size ratio between capsule and pore, membrane mechanical properties, initial osmotic pre-stress, internal viscosity, flow strength. We consider an initially spherical capsule consisting of a liquid droplet enclosed by a thin hyperelastic membrane and moving under imposed flow rate through a cylindrical pore. It is centred on the pore axis, so that the situation is axisymmetric. A numerical model based on the boundary integral method is used to follow the capsule motion and compute its deformation. When the cylindrical pore is long enough, the capsule reaches a stationary <b>parachute</b> <b>shape</b> that depends on the system parameters. When the membrane is strain-softening, a steady state may not exist and the capsule may break-up. The exit from the pore is a transient phenomenon that leads to increased tensions in the membrane and thin films between the pore wall and the capsule. We show how this process depends on membrane properties and internal viscosity...|$|R
