5|$|Anup Rubens was {{selected}} to compose the film's music and background score in mid March 2013 marking his second collaboration with both Kumar and Chaitanya after Ishq (2012) and Autonagar Surya (2014) respectively. Kumar read the script to Rubens without revealing the film's cast. After Rubens accepted {{a role in the}} film, both met Nagarjuna. Rubens {{said in an interview that}} he worked for fewer days when compared to his previous works and added that Kumar had a small <b>story</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> within every song in the film. Due to Nageswara Rao's death, a song's tune was replaced with another tune and a few lines of the song Nenu Puttanu from the film Prem Nagar (1971).|$|E
5|$|The Nazi era {{continues}} to inform how Germans view {{themselves and their}} country. Virtually every family suffered losses during the war or has a <b>story</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell,</b> though Germans kept quiet about their experiences and {{felt a sense of}} communal guilt, even if they were not directly involved in war crimes. Once study of Nazi Germany was introduced into the school curriculum starting in the 1970s, as people began researching the experiences of their family members. Study of the era and a willingness to critically examine its mistakes has {{led to the development of}} a strong democracy in today's Germany, but with lingering undercurrents of antisemitism and neo-Nazi thought.|$|E

5|$|Because Jacob {{mentioned}} {{hearing a}} plane in the woods, Carl asks the brothers to assist an FBI agent, Neil Baxter, {{in a search for}} the missing aircraft. Hank and Jacob meet with Baxter and Carl at the police station. Sarah grows skeptical of Baxter, whom she later discovers to be an impostor; she contacts and warns Hank, who steals a handgun from Carl's office. The four men head into the woods and split up. When he finds the plane, Baxter kills Carl, and engages in a gunfight with Hank. Hank manages to kill Baxter with the gun he had stolen. Hank starts to concoct another <b>story</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the authorities. Jacob however announces that {{he does not want to}} live with these bad memories; he threatens to shoot himself to end it. He then encourages Hank to kill him instead and frame Baxter for the crime. After grappling with the decision, Hank kills Jacob.|$|E
5|$|For the remake, Freddy {{was brought}} back to his darker roots {{and away from the}} comical {{character}} he had become in later Nightmare on Elm Street sequels. Fuller pointed out that this Freddy does have one-liners, but his comments come from a darker sense of humor and not intended to be as campy as previously seen. In addition, it was decided to follow Craven's original characterization of Freddy as a child molester. The decision to apply that characteristic was based in part on the idea that there would not be much of a <b>story</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> if he simply killed children for no apparent reason. It would be easy for the teenage characters to figure out, whereas it is easier to hide the idea of children being molested and force the teen characters to seek out the truth of what happened. In an effort to keep the story fresh, Heisserer developed the concept of micro-naps. In the story, as the characters prolong their time without sleeping they begin to experience micro-naps, which is where a character will unknowingly start dreaming while they are still awake. The micro-naps allowed the filmmakers the chance to blur the lines between reality and the dreamworld by offering an explanation for how the characters could slip so easily into a dream.|$|E

25|$|As the hip hop {{community}} worldwide {{received the}} album {{with a high}} note, the members of N.W.A became the top stars for the emerging new era of gangsta rap while popularizing the lyrics of Ice Cube and MC Ren. The album also helped to spawn many young MCs and gangsta hip hop groups from areas such as Compton, California, and South Central Los Angeles, as many thought {{they had the same}} <b>story</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> and the ability to pursue the career track that N.W.A had taken, hence groups such as Compton's Most Wanted coming into being.|$|E
25|$|As to {{the other}} {{question}} — that of singing roles that, according to self-proclaimed experts, {{we ought not to}} be singing — I have a little <b>story</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell.</b> When I decided to sing Otello, many people told me that I was crazy. Mario Del Monaco, they said, had had the proper kind of voice for the role, and my voice was nothing like his. Twenty years earlier, Del Monaco had been warned not to sing Otello because his voice was nothing like that of Ramon Vinay, who was then performing the opera all over the world. Vinay, of course, had heard that only a tenor with a piercing sound like Giovanni Martinelli's ought to sing the part. Some years earlier, Martinelli had had Antonin Trantoul, who had sung Otello at La Scala in the twenties, held up to him as a shining example; but at La Scala, those who still remembered the very first Otello, Francesco Tamagno, had found Trantoul completely unsatisfactory. But there exists a letter from Verdi to his publisher in which the composer makes it quite clear that Tamagno left a great deal to be desired.|$|E

500|$|Six {{months passed}} as Rogers {{worked on a}} social game before he chose {{to make a few}} more changes: more enemy types and progression, {{graphics}} in the background, and so emailed people to continue development.

He fine-tuned the game with gut-driven decisions. For example, he applied a concept he called [...] "sticky friction" [...] from Super Mario Bros. 3 to the game's controls. One of the final features was the [...] "scream sound effect" [...] Rogers made with his guitar and [...] "crushed" [...] for a distorted and quasi-digital sound that he compared to those made by eccentric Japanese musicians whose records he owned.|$|E

Meanwhile, in another publicity move, Glenda convinces Tex to buy a Imperial against his life insurance for Deke, inventing a <b>story</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Deke that it was a gift from the widow of an oil magnate.
