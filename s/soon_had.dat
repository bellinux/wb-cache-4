The ambition {{to run in the}} Formula Two championship was planned to be financially fuelled by a Liechtenstein driver, Manfred Schurti. These plans only resulted in one of Royale's F2 cars being built before the project was scrapped and Bob King, the head of Royale, left the company.|$|E
5|$|The {{deaths of}} Germanicus' oldest sons {{elevated}} his third son, Gaius Caesar (Caligula), to successor {{and he became}} princeps when Tiberius died in AD 37. Drusus' son Tiberius Gemellus was summoned to Capri by his father Tiberius, where he and Gaius Caligula were made joint heirs. When Caligula assumed power, he made Gemellus his adopted son, but Caligula <b>soon</b> <b>had</b> Gemellus killed for plotting against him.|$|E
5|$|Accum {{held his}} first lecture on {{chemistry}} and mineralogy {{in a small}} room in his house on Old Compton Street. His audience grew so rapidly that he <b>soon</b> <b>had</b> to rent the Medical Theatre on Cork Street. After resigning from the Royal Institution and taking a new position with the Surrey Institution, he continued with his popular lectures. An advertisement in The Times on January 6, 1809 indicates that Accum offered a course on mineralogy and the chemical analysis of metals every Wednesday evening.|$|E

5|$|After a posting to Amberley, Queensland, Cresswell {{served on}} the {{directing}} staff {{of the first two}} courses held at the newly formed RAAF Staff College, Point Cook. The college was the successor organisation to the wartime RAAF Staff School, and commenced its first six-month course on 13June 1949. Cresswell had by this time reverted to the rank of squadron leader, as the air force and its wartime officer corps shrank dramatically following demobilisation. On 10July 1950, he was appointed commanding officer of No.21 (City of Melbourne) Squadron, a Citizen Air Force unit based at Laverton and equipped with Mustangs crewed by reserve pilots. Cresswell was unimpressed by what he saw as the casual attitude displayed by his part-time pilots and <b>soon</b> <b>had</b> them practising appropriate fighter tactics.|$|E
5|$|After {{making a}} recovery, Kizirian and the Marine units took {{the capital city}} of NaHa and were {{preparing}} for another assault. Kizirian's unit had fought its way to the crest of a hill and dug in. Kizirian was standing watch at the company command post inside an Okinawa burial ground. When replacements joined the company, many Japanese soldiers harassed the lines by infiltrating the positions of the more inexperienced soldiers. Kizirian ordered that flares should be fired at irregular intervals to would illuminate the scene and distract the enemy. The idea proved successful and the newly arrived Marines <b>soon</b> <b>had</b> the situation under control.|$|E
5|$|As a showman, Butlin {{quickly became}} successful, one stall {{becoming}} several, and several becoming his own travelling fair. Butlin <b>soon</b> <b>had</b> fixed fairground sites {{as well as}} his travelling fair – the first was at Olympia in London outside Bertram Mills' Circus. In 1925 he opened a set of fairground stalls in Barry Island, Wales where he observed the way landladies in seaside resorts would (sometimes literally) push families out of the lodgings between meals, and began to nurture the idea of a holiday camp similar to the one he had attended whilst an employee at Eatons.|$|E

5|$|During his {{ministry}} in England, Toulmin served two Dissenting congregations in Lancashire. From 1786 to 1788, he was pastor {{of a church}} in Monton, and from 1787 to 1793, he served another congregation at Chowbent Chapel in Atherton. He <b>soon</b> <b>had</b> nearly 1,000 followers, Many of his followers supported the French Revolution, attracting the attention of anti-dissenting partisans in England. A group of these partisans once took advantage of Toulmin's absence to threaten his house, necessitating his swift return to protect his family. Upon arriving, {{he was able to}} break up the mob via diplomacy alone.|$|E
5|$|In 1531 Peter IV Rareş invaded Poland {{in order}} to reoccupy the Pocuţia region (in modern Ukraine), but his army was defeated. Now he {{concluded}} a secret treaty with Ferdinand I of Hungary, but <b>soon</b> <b>had</b> to seek refugee in Transylvania when Suleiman I led an army against him. This was the first occasion when a prince, Stephen V Lăcustă (15381540) was appointed by the sultan. At the same time, the sultan occupied Brăila and Tighina (now in Moldova), and the Budjak region (now in Ukraine). Peter IV Rareş recovered his throne {{in exchange for a}} large sum of money in 1541. His death was followed by a period characterized by fights between pretenders to the throne and among the boyar parties.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, Tivadar Puskás got Tesla {{another job}} in Paris with the Continental Edison Company. Tesla began working {{in what was}} then a brand new industry, {{installing}} indoor incandescent lighting citywide {{in the form of an}} electric power utility. The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Société Electrique Edison, the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting system. There he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering. Management took notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and <b>soon</b> <b>had</b> him designing and building improved versions of generating dynamos and motors. They also sent him on to troubleshoot engineering problems at other Edison utilities being built around France and in Germany.|$|E

5|$|Quinziato, {{the weakest}} climber {{of the three}} leading riders, {{attacked}} at {{the summit of the}} Denderoordberg, the penultimate climb of the day, quickly dropping Lampaert. Leukemans attempted to hold Quinziato's wheel, but was dropped on the flat. Quinziato <b>soon</b> <b>had</b> half a minute's lead and entered the base of the Muur alone. He had more difficulty on the climb, however: as Leukemans and Lampaert reached the cobbles, they quickly began to catch him. Quinziato eventually crossed the line with just a few seconds to spare. This was the second professional victory of his career, nine years after his first, which had come in the 2006 Eneco Tour. Wellens finished in a large group 42 seconds back and sealed his overall victory in the race.|$|E
5|$|The District {{found an}} {{investor}} {{to finance the}} upgrade in 1901, American Charles Yerkes. On 15 July 1901, Yerkes established the Metropolitan District Electric Traction Company with himself as managing director and raised £1million {{to carry out the}} electrification, including construction of the generating station and supplying the new rolling stock. Yerkes <b>soon</b> <b>had</b> control of the District Railway and his experiences in the United States led him to favour DC with a track level conductor rail similar to that in use on the City & South London Railway and Central London Railway. After arbitration by the Board of Trade, the DC system was adopted.|$|E
5|$|The {{fire spread}} {{quickly in the}} high wind and, by mid-morning on Sunday, people {{abandoned}} attempts at extinguishing it and fled. The moving human mass and their bundles and carts made the lanes impassable for firemen and carriages. Pepys took a coach back into the city from Whitehall, but only reached St Paul's Cathedral before {{he had to get}} out and walk. Pedestrians with handcarts and goods were still on the move away from the fire, heavily weighed down. The parish churches not directly threatened were filling up with furniture and valuables, which <b>soon</b> <b>had</b> to be moved further afield.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of printed planar technologies greatly simplified {{the manufacture of}} many microwave components including filters, and microwave integrated circuits then became possible. It is not known when planar transmission lines originated, but experiments using them were recorded as early as 1936. The inventor of printed stripline, however, is known; this was Robert M. Barrett who published the idea in 1951.Barrett, 1952,Niehenke et al., p.846. This caught on rapidly, and Barrett's stripline <b>soon</b> <b>had</b> fierce commercial competition from rival planar formats, especially triplate and microstrip. The generic term stripline in modern usage usually refers to the form then known as triplate.|$|E
5|$|The testimonies {{of foreigners}} at the {{cemetery}} were quickly reported to international news organisations, and video footage of the massacre was widely broadcast internationally causing outrage. In response to the massacre, activists around the world organised in solidarity with the East Timorese, and a new urgency was brought to calls for self-determination. TAPOL, a British organisation formed in 1973 to advocate for democracy in Indonesia, increased its work around East Timor. In the United States, the East Timor Action Network (now the East Timor and Indonesia Action Network) was founded and <b>soon</b> <b>had</b> chapters in ten cities around the country. Other solidarity groups appeared in Portugal, Australia, Japan, Germany, Malaysia, Ireland, and Brazil.|$|E
5|$|When {{the state}} would not enforce his {{order to reduce the}} catch of non-Indian {{commercial}} fishermen, Boldt took direct action, placing the matter under federal supervision. The United States Coast Guard and the National Marine Fisheries Service were ordered to enforce the ruling and <b>soon</b> <b>had</b> boats in the water confronting violators. Some of the protesters rammed Coast Guard boats and at least one member of the Coast Guard was shot. Those whom the officers caught breaking the court's orders were taken before federal magistrates and fined for contempt, and the illegal fishing as a protest stopped. The United States District Court continued to exercise jurisdiction over the matter, determining traditional fishing locations and compiling major orders of the court.|$|E

5|$|Written by William Emms. Planned as {{the fourth}} serial of Series 4, The Imps was a four-part story {{concerned}} about a spaceship overrun by Imp-like aliens and aggressive alien vegetation. The script was commissioned on 17 October 1966, and <b>soon</b> <b>had</b> to be rewritten to accommodate new companion Jamie. However, due to sickness {{on the part of}} Emms, this took so long that further rewrites were needed to explain the loss of Ben and Polly and on 4 January 1967 the story was dropped. Emms reused elements of the story in Mission to Venus, a Choose Your Own Adventure-style story featuring the Sixth Doctor.|$|E
5|$|At the {{northern}} end of Goswell Road, the route northwards follows a one-way section to the Angel, turning right into Islington High Street. The southwards route from Islington High Street follows City Road for a short distance before joining Goswell Road via Wakley Street. The earliest reference to Islington High Street is its appearance on a 1590 map of the area. At this time, nine inns (including the Angel, which subsequently gave its name to the area), as well as housing and a public pond were shown lining the street. The Peacock Inn, one of the nine inns, and which operated on Islington High Street from 1564 to 1962, was where Tom of Tom Brown's Schooldays stayed prior to travelling to Rugby School. In 1716 Islington High Street came {{under the control of the}} newly formed Islington Turnpike Trust. The Trust grew rapidly and <b>soon</b> <b>had</b> control of most major roads in the area, building a number of major road arteries through the expanding residential areas, including Caledonian Road, Euston Road, City Road and New North Road.|$|E
5|$|Atlético de Kolkata had {{the first}} major {{opportunity}} {{of the second half}} when Jakub Podaný crossed the ball into the box with both Baljit Sahni and Arnal looking to head it in before David James came out to catch the ball.

Just after the 60th minute, Kerala Blasters defender Sandesh Jhingan almost headed the ball into his own net while trying to clear it. The Kerala Blasters continued to have the most chances throughout the match, which was compounded in the last minute of regulation time when Michael Chopra had his point blank range shot saved by Apoula Edel. Four minutes later, in the final minute of stoppage time, Atlético de Kolkata substitute Mohammed Rafique headed home a corner from Podaný to win the match and the championship.|$|E
