25|$|Missy {{would sing}} {{constantly}} while in her room. Whenever <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> she would stop singing, and upon returning, she would resume singing where she left off.|$|E
25|$|After Lazarus {{had checked}} her gun {{and come to}} the {{interrogation}} room, they explained that this was really about some loose ends they were trying to tie up in the Rasmussen case, since her name had come up in the investigation. They claimed they wanted a private setting because while Ruetten was an old boyfriend, she was long married to someone else and did not want her private life to become the subject of office gossip. Stearns and Jaramillo knew they would have to tread carefully since Lazarus herself was well aware of police interview techniques and her rights to silence and legal counsel, which she could invoke at any time. They rambled and digressed from the subject at times, sometimes discussing unrelated police business, but eventually came back to Rasmussen. Lazarus claimed to recall little due to the intervening years, but gradually revealed more and more knowledge—including oblique acknowledgements of her visits to the Ruetten condo—until she accused her colleagues of considering her a suspect, whereupon they allowed that there was DNA evidence connecting her to the crime scene and she was free to go. <b>She</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and was immediately arrested and charged with the murder.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Mr. Bundercombe, Eve, and I {{exchanged}} glances.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> hurriedly <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> <b>The</b> next minute, {{my father}} entered it.|$|R
60|$|As soon as <b>she</b> had <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> Leigh dropped <b>the</b> ten louis {{into the}} adjoint's hand.|$|R
60|$|She stood {{surveying}} {{him for a}} moment, then <b>she</b> quietly <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> He stared after her.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> with a {{farewell}} caress. There was something almost tigress-like {{about the way}} in which her arms wound themselves around him--some gleam of the terrified victim in his eyes, as he felt her touch. Then <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Saton sank back into an easy-chair, and gazed steadfastly into the fire through half-closed eyes.|$|E
60|$|Miss Merton obeyed. <b>She</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{literally}} speechless. Helène {{rang the}} bell.|$|E
60|$|As <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> Miss Howard's face changed. She leant {{towards me}} eagerly.|$|E
60|$|Nora acquiesced at once. As soon as <b>she</b> had <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> Helen {{leaned over}} and laid her hand upon Sir Henry's arm.|$|R
60|$|As soon as <b>she</b> had <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> <b>the</b> {{two girls}} threw down their work and, running across to Roger, saluted him most heartily.|$|R
60|$|A cry {{of protest}} broke from the appalled Nutty, but Elizabeth {{did not hear}} it. <b>She</b> had <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and {{was on her way}} downstairs.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> {{holding her}} {{unfinished}} {{bread and butter}} in her hand. William glanced at Cassandra.|$|E
60|$|Crying bitterly <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and her {{mistress}} {{shut the}} door after her, remaining there with her lover.|$|E
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> and {{presently}} returned with a most tempting-looking glass of clear amber-coloured jelly.|$|E
60|$|But when <b>she</b> had <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> Mr. Treffry {{put down}} the Times {{and stared at the}} door, humming to himself, and thoughtfully {{fingering}} his chin.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> then <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> {{but soon}} returned, {{followed}} by two serving maids, with complexions so dark brown in color that Dot was almost afraid of them.|$|R
6000|$|Aunt Dorcas {{turned away}} quickly, and when <b>she</b> had <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> Plums said, as he unbent from the awkward {{position}} {{he had at}} first assumed in the straight chair: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Sad work, sad work, after all!' said Elizabeth, as <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{to finish}} hearing the little ones, and release Mrs. Woodbourne.|$|E
60|$|Dipping her {{handkerchief}} in cold water, {{and passing}} {{it over her}} eyes as <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> she instantly hastened to her sister.|$|E
60|$|MRS. CLANDON. I {{am afraid}} {{she will not}} return until you have gone Mr. Valentine. <b>She</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> {{expressly}} to avoid you.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{she were}} a man I'd bundle her off the {{plantation}} root and crop, whale- boat, Tahitian sailors, sovereigns, and all," [...] he muttered to himself after <b>she</b> had <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
60|$|Then looking him {{straight}} in the eyes, <b>she</b> turned and <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will find}} it more {{convenient}} to call me Lydia," [...] said Miss Carew. [...] "Otherwise you will be supposed to refer to my grandaunt, a very old lady." [...] <b>She</b> then <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
60|$|My mother's hand, I knew, {{was seeking}} mine, but I was angry {{and would not}} see; and without another word <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{shook her}} head and smiled cheerily. Then, laying the princess on a chintz-covered couch without {{disturbing}} the child's slumbers, <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{uttered the}} last {{sentence}} slowly and with an earnestness that bewildered all her hearers--except, perhaps, Josie O'Gorman. And then <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Dudgeon, {{turning to}} look malignantly at Essie, misses her and looks quickly round to see where she has moved to; then, seeing that <b>she</b> has <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> without leave, closes her lips vengefully.|$|R
6000|$|As soon as <b>she</b> had <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> I {{turned to}} the doctor and said, 'What a dreadful shock it must have been to Lady Erskine! I wonder that she bears it as well as she does.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} was all because he didn't like Lady Linlithgow," [...] said Cecilia. Lucy had not a word to say. She stood for a minute among them, trying to think, and then <b>she</b> slowly <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
60|$|When <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> Philip {{threw himself}} on his bed. He had to clench his fists {{in order to prevent}} himself from crying.|$|E
60|$|The {{sick man}} lay back a little--he could not lie down. His {{daughter}} sat {{as if she}} had been struck. Then <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> {{followed}} by Louise and Beth, {{both of whom}} were glad to be alone that they might conquer their bitter disappointment.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} {{excuse me for}} a few minutes, Mr. Meeson," [...] {{interrupted}} Lady Holmhurst at this point; [...] "I {{have to go to}} see about the dinner," [...] and before Augusta could interfere <b>she</b> had <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
60|$|Augusta {{received}} in silence from Mrs. L. the fine sewing for which <b>she</b> came, and <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
60|$|At {{that moment}} a {{carriage}} thundered at the door, and she remembered {{for the first}} time that she was expecting her father and mother. <b>She</b> softly <b>left</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and closed <b>the</b> door; and finding Anne in <b>the</b> nest <b>room,</b> sent her down.|$|R
