50|$|DoubleTree's {{strategy}} {{to grow the}} brand has been to convince operators of other brands to <b>switch</b> <b>flags.</b> This {{is in contrast to}} brands like Marriott or Sheraton which rely on new construction to grow their footprint. DoubleTree also provides lower cost options to improve properties, which help operators remain in the brand system.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{flag of the}} Knights Hospitaller {{consisted of}} a white Maltese Cross on a black background, however this was never used in Malta. The only flag used in Malta {{in the time of}} the Knights consisted of a white symmetrical cross on a red field with the cross having a width of 1/5 the height of the flag - similar to the flag of England, colors reversed with a proportion of 5:3. It says that Malta <b>switched</b> <b>flags</b> with Denmark in the early days. The flag is still used by the Knights' modern successor, the Sovereign Military Order of Malta.|$|R
5000|$|On 24 September 1915, Herbert was {{involved}} in another controversial incident while commanding the Baralong. The German submarine [...] had sunk three merchant vessels on the preceding day and was now attacking the Urbino when the innocuous-looking Baralong, once again showing a false flag, came into view. The submarine saw an opportunity for another kill and had begun manoeuvres to attain this end when Herbert once again <b>switched</b> <b>flags</b> and opened fire. U-41 sank rapidly {{as she tried to}} dive after being hit at the base of her conning tower. Two of her 32-man crew survived.|$|R
50|$|Pinedo entertained {{plans for}} resisting, but finally desisted {{because of his}} obvious {{numerical}} inferiority and the want of enough nationals among his crew (approximately 80% of his forces were British mercenaries who refused to fight their countrymen). The British forces disembarked on 3 January and <b>switched</b> the <b>flags,</b> delivering the Argentine one to Pinedo, who left on 5 January.|$|R
50|$|Originally, the straightaway {{was marked}} with a broad black line down its center. This was {{eventually}} changed to lines down either side, as the center line wore out too quickly. As the costs for painting the lines has gone up, organizations have <b>switched</b> to <b>flags</b> and cones as track markers. The last event to use black lines was Speed Week, August 2009.|$|R
25|$|Perry then <b>switched</b> his <b>flag</b> to Susquehanna {{and made}} call at Naha on Great Lewchew Island (now Okinawa) from May 17–26. Ignoring {{the claims of}} Satsuma Domain to the islands, he demanded an {{audience}} with the Ryukyuan King Shō Tai at Shuri Castle and secured promises that the Kingdom {{would be open to}} trade with the United States. Continuing on to the Ogasawara islands in mid-June, Perry met with the local inhabitants and purchased a plot of land.|$|R
50|$|Four speed {{settings}} were possible, three {{provided by}} the main controller, and the fourth by a weak field <b>flag</b> <b>switch.</b> Shunt mode was used in depots and yards, and was achieved by connecting resistance banks in series with the motors. In series mode, the resistance was removed in steps, until the two motors were in series between the 600V supply. The maximum speed in this mode was around 15 mph. Parallel mode reconnected the motors in parallel across the supply, and allowed operation up to normal full speed. The weak field <b>flag</b> <b>switch</b> allowed higher speeds still, but was only to be operated on open sections of the line. Its operation was visible from outside of the train.|$|R
5000|$|During {{his term}} as mayor, in 1883, Neutral Moresnet <b>switched</b> its {{territorial}} <b>flag</b> to {{one with a}} tricolore with horizontal bars in black, white and blue. The reason for the change is unclear. Bilharz was succeeded by Hubert Schmetz on 20 June 1885.|$|R
50|$|A feature toggle (also feature <b>switch,</b> feature <b>flag,</b> feature flipper, {{conditional}} feature, etc.) is {{a technique}} in software development that attempts to provide an alternative to maintaining multiple source-code branches (known as feature branches), such that the feature can be tested, even before it is completed and ready for release. Feature toggle is used to hide, enable or disable the features, during run time. For example, during the development process, the developer can enable the feature for testing and disable it for remaining users.|$|R
50|$|The colorguard {{accompanies the}} band {{on the field}} during the {{performance}} but is not constrained to marching {{like the rest of}} the band. As in most marching bands, the UMass colorguard follows sets and often <b>switches</b> between different <b>flags,</b> rifles, and sabres during the performance depending on the music being played.|$|R
50|$|On 12 April, still Suffren's flagship, {{she fought}} in the bitter battle of Providien off Sri Lanka. She {{attacked}} HMS Superb again at pistol-shot range, causing a fire to break out aboard the British ship. She then dismasted HMS Monmouth, forcing her to leave the British line. However, the Héros was also heavily damaged, losing {{the top of her}} foremast. This meant she was no longer maneouvrable and so forced to leave the battle, with Suffren <b>switching</b> his <b>flag</b> to the 64 gun Ajax mid-battle. The Héros then called at Batticaloa on Sri Lanka {{with the rest of the}} squadron for repairs and to rest her crew.|$|R
25|$|On 2 September 1994, Silja Festival {{was moved}} from Vaasa {{to serve the}} Helsinki–Tallinn route. For the summer of 1995, (26 June to 14 August) she served Vaasa–Sundsvall again, then {{returned}} to Helsinki–Tallinn. After the charter agreement of MS Silja Scandinavia ended in April 1997 On 5 April 1997, Silja Line <b>switched</b> the ship's <b>flag</b> from Finnish to Swedish and put her back on Stockholm–Mariehamn–Turku service, where she remained until 2008.|$|R
5000|$|Pinedo protested {{verbally}} {{and refused}} to lower the Argentine flag. The British forces disembarked on 3 January and <b>switched</b> the <b>flags,</b> delivering the Argentine one to Pinedo. The British schooner Rapid departed on the 5 January 1833 taking the mutineers to Buenos Aires. [...] There is some confusion over {{the date of the}} sailing of the Sarandí, official protests indicate that the Sarandí sailed on 5 January and modern accounts repeat this. [...] However, the trial transcript from Pinedo's court martial indicate that the Sarandí sailed a day earlier. Argentina now claims that Vernet's colony was also expelled at this time, though many historians contradict this, stating that the colonists were encouraged to remain initially under the authority of Vernet's storekeeper, William Dickson and later his deputy, Matthew Brisbane.|$|R
500|$|The episode's {{visual effects}} were {{produced}} by Rainmaker Digital Effects. Gero wrote the scene involving the minute long sequence where the Horizon weapon fires from the Apollo to the Asuran homeworld. He {{made contact with}} Mark Savela {{to see if it}} could be done; Savela was up to the challenge. The sequence was costly, since the visual effects team had to make a 3D world that would last a minute long to ensure that the sequence followed Gero's script. The sequences where Atlantis takes off {{from the bottom of the}} ocean were stock footage from [...] "Rising", with the shield and beam added on. Another reason to keep the scenes was because the writers liked the scene to be reused. Another visual effect was used to <b>switch</b> Keller's <b>flag</b> patch from Canadian to American, since the decision to have Keller an American character was made after filming.|$|R
40|$|The NCP 380 is a {{high side}} power−distribution switch {{designed}} for applications where heavy capacitive loads and short−circuits {{are likely to be}} encountered, incorporating a 70 m � (DFN package), P−channel MOSFET in a single package. The device limits the output current to a desired level by switching into a regulation −current mode when the output load exceeds the current−limit threshold or a short is present. The current−limit threshold is either user adjustable between 100 mA and 1. 5 A via an external resistor or internally fixed. The power−switch rise and fall times are controlled to minimize current ringing during switching. An internal reverse−voltage detection comparator disables the power−switch if the output voltage is higher than the input voltage to protect devices on the input side of the <b>switch.</b> The <b>FLAG</b> logic output asserts low during over current, reverse−voltage or over temperature conditions. The switch is controlled by a logic enable input active high or low...|$|R
50|$|Perry then <b>switched</b> his <b>flag</b> to Susquehanna {{and called}} on the Ryukyu islands from May 17-26. Ignoring the claims of Satsuma Domain to the islands, {{as well as his}} own orders, he {{threatened}} and bluffed local authorities by threatening to attack with 200 troops unless he were allowed trading rights and land for a coaling station. Perry landed his Marines, whom he drilled on the beach for hours at a time, and demanded an audience with the Ryukyu King Shō Tai at Shuri Castle. Knowing that his every action would be reported to Japanese authorities in Edo, Perry was careful to avoid meeting with low-ranked officials and made much use of military ceremony and shipboard hospitality to demonstrate both American military power and the peaceful intent of his expedition. Perry left with promises that the islands would be completely open to trade with the United States. Continuing on the Ogasawara islands in mid-June, Perry met with the local inhabitants and even purchased a plot of land.|$|R
40|$|An {{automated}} system to perform liquid-liquid extraction in monosegmented flow analysis is described. The system {{is controlled by}} a microcomputer that can track the localization of the aqueous monosegmented sample in the manifold. Optical switches are employed to sense the gas-liquid interface of the air bubbles that define the monosegment. The logical level changes, generated by the <b>switches,</b> are <b>flagged</b> by the computer through a home-made interface that also contains the analogue-to-digital converter for signal acquisition. The sequence of operations, necessary for a single extraction or for concentration of the analyte in the organic phase, is triggered by these logical transitions. The system was evaluated for extraction of Cd(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II) and concentration of Cd(II) from aqueous solutions at pH 9. 9 (NH 3 /NH 4 Cl buffer) into chloroform containing PAN (1 -(2 -pyridylazo) - 2 -naphthol). The results show a mean repeatability of 3 % (rsd) for a 2. 0 mg l- 1 Cd(II) solution and a linear increase of the concentration factor for a 0. 5 mg l- 1 Cd(II) solution observed for up to nine extraction cycles...|$|R

Radio Free Asia (which is funded by the U.S. government) claimed that Chinese internet cafes were being required to <b>switch</b> to Red <b>Flag</b> Linux even if they were using genuine copies of the Windows OS.

Naval jacks are worn at {{the bow of}} warships, but only when anchored or docked during daylight hours or when [...] "dressing overall" [...] for special occasions. The national flag had replaced both the White Ensign at the ensign staff and the Canadian Blue Ensign at the jack staff in 1965, and the national flag remained the ensign of Canadian Forces ships after {{the introduction of the}} new jack. Effective May 5, 2013 (Battle of the Atlantic Sunday), the two <b>flags</b> <b>switched</b> roles: the white flag with the maple leaf canton became the ensign, and the national flag became the jack.|$|R
40|$|Modern compilers {{implement}} {{a number of}} optimization switches {{and they must be}} configured carefully in order to obtain the best performance. However, there exist few strategies to configure these compiler <b>switches</b> or <b>flags.</b> This is caused {{by the fact that the}} performance of a code is both dependent on the target architecture and the application. Additionally, the effect of the compiler optimizations is highly dependent on other compiler optimizations which are employed, causing the actual effect to be masked and not predictable. In this thesis, we propose to use statistical analysis to determine the effectiveness of the compiler optimizations. This enables us to construct systematic methodologies for determining settings of compiler optimizations automatically. The proposed methodologies are all independent from the implementation of compilers and implementation of applications, therefore, it is easy to apply our methodologies to any combination of compilers and applications. This versatility makes our results unique compared to other approaches. Additionally, with our methodologies, users can choose their optimization objective, for example, execution time or code size, etc. From the results shown in this thesis, we can concluded that the statistical tuning of compiler optimization is both possible and useful.

5000|$|The race {{restarted}} with 39 laps to go, with Edwards {{still at}} the head of the race, and remained so until the eleventh caution of the race flew with three laps to go after the manual override <b>switch</b> in the <b>flag</b> stand was activated, which turned on the caution lights. NASCAR vice-president of competition Robin Pemberton stated after the race that the organization [...] "were scanning cars and spotters, and there's some of us in the tower that only heard it after the teams were talking about it because we were looking at other things around the racetrack". He added that the situation was where NASCAR “learn a lot of lessons, and when we learn a lesson like this we'll go in and further investigate some things" [...] and that [...] "there's probably some things that we needed to do to better secure that area where the manual override is on the lights".|$|R
40|$|This paper report {{describes}} the techniques for analyzing, designing, controlling {{and improving the}} health care management system. A line following robot carrying medicine has been designed for providing the medicine to the patient whenever they need it. A Line follower robot is an electronic system that can detect and follow the line drawn on the floor. Generally, the line is specified a predefined path that can be either visible like a black line on a white surface with a high contrasted color. Light dependent resistor sensor has been attached with the robot whose resistance varies with light intensity. When the LDR receives maximum amount of light then its resistance goes to its minimum value, ideally zero and when no light falling on the LDR then its resistance goes to its maximum value, ideally infinitive. A switch with IR sensor has been fitted near the patient, which connection has {{been made by the}} robot too. If the patient presses the <b>switch</b> then a <b>flag</b> bit set in the microcontroller, from which line following robot follows the line and got reached near the patient and provide the medicine to the patient with the help of dc motor. A proximity sensor also has been attached with the robot so that robot can detect any obstacle on their ways and can alarm. The ability to get someone around the clock is the best thing that this system can do. This technology focused on the delivery of safe, timely, efficient, effective, patient-centered and equitable health care...|$|R
6000|$|And so {{much for}} a raw opinion on Japanese infantry. The cavalry were having a picnic {{on the other side}} of the parade-ground--circling right and left by sections, trying to do {{something}} with a troop, and so forth. I would fain believe that the gentlemen I saw were recruits. But they wore all their arms, and their officers were just as clever as themselves. Half of them were in white fatigue-dress and flat cap,--and wore half-boots of brown leather with short hunting-spurs and black straps; no chains. They carried carbine and sword--the sword fixed to the man, and the carbine slung over the back. No martingales, but breastplates and crupper, a huge, heavy saddle, with single hide-girth, over two numdahs, completed the equipment which a thirteen-hand pony, all mane and tail, was trying to get rid of. When you thrust a two-pound bit and bridoon into a small pony's mouth, you hurt his feelings. When the riders wear, as did my friends, white worsted gloves, they cannot take a proper hold of the reins. When they ride with both hands, sitting well on the mount's neck, knuckles level with its ears and the stirrup leathers as short as they can be, the chances of the pony getting rid of the rider are manifestly increased. Never have I seen such a wild dream of equitation as the Tokio parade-ground showed. Do you remember the picture in Alice in Wonderland, just before Alice found the Lion and the Unicorn; when she met the armed men coming through the woods? I thought of that, and I thought of the White Knight in the same classic, and I laughed aloud. Here were a set of very fair ponies, sure-footed as goats, mostly entires, and full of go. Under Japanese weights they would have made very thorough mounted infantry. And here was this blindly imitative nation trying to turn them into heavy cavalry. As long as the little beasts were gravely trotting in circles they did not mind their work. But when it came to slashing at the Turk's head they objected very much indeed. I affiliated myself to a section who, armed with long wooden swords, were enjoying some Turk's-heading. Out started a pony at the gentlest of canters, while the rider bundled all the reins into one hand, and held his sword like a lance. Then the pony shied a little shy, shook his shaggy head, and began to passage round the Turk's head. There was no pressure of knee or rein to tell him what was wanted. The man on top began kicking with the spurs from shoulder to rump, and shaking up the ironmongery in the poor brute's mouth. The pony could neither rear, nor kick, nor buck; but it shook itself free of the incubus who slid off. Three times I saw this happen. The catastrophe didn't rise to the dignity of a fall. It was the blundering collapse of incompetence plus worsted gloves, two-handed riding, and a haystack of equipment. Very often the pony went at the post, and the man delivered a back-handed cut at the Turk's head which nearly brought him out of his world-too-wide saddle. Again and again this solemn performance was repeated. I can honestly say that the ponies are very willing to break rank and leave their companions, which is what an English troop-horse fails in; but I fancy this is more due to the urgent private affairs of the pony than any skill in training. The troops charged once or twice in a terrifying canter. When the men wished to stop they leaned back and tugged, and the pony put his head to the ground, and bored all he knew. They charged me, but I was merciful, and forebore to empty half the saddles, as I assuredly could have done by throwing up my arms and yelling [...] "Hi!" [...] The saddest thing of all was the painful conscientiousness displayed by all the performers in the circus. They had to turn these rats into cavalry. They knew nothing about riding, and what they did know was wrong; but the rats must be made troop-horses. Why wouldn't the scheme work? There was a patient, pathetic wonder on the faces of the men that made me long to take one of them in my arms and try to explain things to him--bridles, for instance, and the futility of hanging on by the spurs. Just when the parade was over, and the troops were ambling off, Providence sent diagonally across the parade-ground, at a gallop, a big, rawboned man on a lathy-red American horse. The brute cracked his nostrils, and <b>switched</b> his <b>flag</b> abroad, and romped across the plain, while his rider dropped one hand and sat still, swaying lightly from the hips. The two served to scale the surroundings. Some one really ought to tell the Mikado that ponies were never intended for dragoons.|$|R
