5|$|If {{granulation}} tissue grows over the injured site, {{it can cause}} stenosis of the airway, after a week to a month. The {{granulation tissue}} must be surgically excised. Delayed diagnosis of a bronchial rupture increases risk of infection and lengthens hospital stay. People with a narrowed airway may suffer dyspnea, coughing, wheezing, respiratory tract infection, and difficulty with clearing secretions. If the bronchiole is completely obstructed, atelectasis occurs: the alveoli of the lung collapse. Lung tissue distal to a completely obstructed bronchiole often does not become infected. Because {{it is filled with}} mucus, this tissue remains functional. When the secretions are removed, the affected portion of the lung is commonly able to function almost normally. However, infection is common in lungs distal to a partially obstructed bronchiole. Infected lung tissue distal to a <b>stricture</b> can be damaged, and wheezing and coughing may develop due to the narrowing. In addition to pneumonia, the stenosis may cause bronchiectasis, in which bronchi are dilated, to develop. Even after an airway with a <b>stricture</b> is restored to normal, the resulting loss of lung function may be permanent.|$|E
5|$|Distrust of Charles's {{religious}} policies {{increased with}} {{his support of}} a controversial anti-Calvinist ecclesiastic, Richard Montagu, who was in disrepute among the Puritans. In his pamphlet A New Gag for an Old Goose (1624), a reply to the Catholic pamphlet A New Gag for the New Gospel, Montagu argued against Calvinist predestination, the doctrine that salvation and damnation were preordained by God. Anti-Calvinists – known as Arminians – believed that human beings could influence their own fate through the exercise of free will. Arminian divines {{had been one of}} the few sources of support for Charles's proposed Spanish marriage. With the support of King James, Montagu produced another pamphlet, entitled Appello Caesarem, in 1625 shortly after the old king's death and Charles's accession. To protect Montagu from the <b>stricture</b> of Puritan members of Parliament, Charles made the cleric one of his royal chaplains, increasing many Puritans' suspicions that Charles favoured Arminianism as a clandestine attempt to aid the resurgence of Catholicism.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Urethral <b>strictures</b> {{remain a}} {{reconstructive}} dilemma, {{due to high}} incidence of recurrence and less than satisfactory outcomes. Even experienced surgeons following strict surgical principles have not achieved optimal results, leading us to think whether the etiology of <b>strictures</b> dictate the outcome. We evaluated this "cause-effect" relationship highlighting {{the significance of the}} etiology on the overall prognosis of urethral <b>strictures.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 302 males with urethral <b>strictures</b> were assessed (both retrospectively and prospectively) over a period of ten years. The preoperative evaluation was performed by retrograde urethrogram, urethrosonogram, and uroflowmetry and categorized, based on etiology: a) as post traumatic, b) post infective, c) iatrogenic or d) unknown. Traumatic <b>strictures</b> were subjected to pelvic X-ray and sub-categorized into grades A, B and C, following the TILE classification. Patients were operated; with tunica albuginea urethroplasty for anterior <b>strictures</b> and U shape prostato-bulbar anastomosis for posterior <b>strictures.</b> RESULTS: Traumatic <b>strictures</b> accounted for 54 % of cases. 127 of the 302 patients were treated using Tunica Albuginea Urethroplasty, while U shaped Prostatobulbar Anastomosis was performed on others. Post traumatic <b>strictures</b> had best outcome whereas post infective <b>strictures</b> had the worse outcome. Among <b>strictures</b> following pelvic fractures, TILE grades A and B had a better post operative course as compared to TILE C. Overall complication rate was 13. 24 %.

40|$|Introduction. Some biliary <b>strictures</b> may be {{manageable}} by percutaneous interventional radiologic techniques (PIRT), but long-term {{efficacy of}} this approach is scarce. Methods. We reviewed retrospectively all patients with biliary <b>strictures</b> secondary to traumatic bile duct injury or <b>strictured</b> bilioenteric anastomoses. Patients in whom the initial management was by PIRT from 1998 through 2003 were selected. Subjects with sclerosing cholangitis, hepatic transplantation, or malignant <b>strictures</b> were excluded. Data were obtained from medical records and/or direct patient contact. Comparisons were made by Fisher's exact test and Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Results. Twenty-seven patients with biliary <b>strictures</b> were treated by PIRT. Mean age was 54 years (range 11 – 86). Most frequent etiology was laparoscopic cholecystectomy injury in 11 patients (41 %). Eight patients (29 %) had undergone biliary resection for malignancy, seven (26 %) a pancreatoduodenectomy, and one for presumed ischemic cholangiopathy; no <b>strictures</b> were secondary to neoplastic recurrence. PIRT was successful in 10 of 11 patients (91 %) with short, isolated bile duct <b>strictures</b> secondary to laparoscopic cholecystectomy and in seven of 15 patients (41 %) with <b>strictured</b> bilioenteric anastomosis, but not in the patient with ischemic cholangiopathy. Twenty patients (74 %) were stent-free at follow-up. Anastomotic biliary <b>strictures</b> were more likely to fail PIRT than isolated <b>strictures</b> secondary to laparoscopic cholecystectomy injury (p= 0. 02). Conclusion. Percutaneous balloon dilatation and stenting can be an effective strategy for patients with bile duct <b>strictures,</b> especially short bile duct <b>strictures</b> after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Anastomotic <b>strictures</b> are associated with less good results when managed by PIRT but are successful in up to 40 % of patients...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE. The {{results of}} {{operative}} repair of benign <b>strictures</b> of the bile duct after cholecystectomy, right hemihepatectomy, vagotomy and antrectomy, choledochal cysts in adults, and chronic pancreatitis, with particular {{reference to the}} use of the Hepp technique for hilar <b>strictures</b> and without the use of transanastomotic tubal stenting, were analyzed in 44 patients. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA. End-to-side bilio-enteric anastomoses have been reported to be associated with restricturing and reoperation in 12 % to 25 % of cases and operative morbidity and mortality rates of 10 % and 5 % to 8 %, respectively. Long-term transanastomotic tubal stenting is widely practiced in an attempt to prevent or diminish anastomotic <b>stricturing.</b> METHODS. The Hepp technique of wide, accurate, mucosa-to-mucosa anastomosis between the left hepatic duct and a jejunal Roux loop was used in 28 patients with hilar bile duct <b>strictures.</b> The same technical principle of wide side-to-side anastomosis was used in most of the lower <b>strictures.</b> Patients have been observed for 1 to 14 years (median, 7 years). RESULTS. The operative mortality rate was 7 % (3 patients), but only 2. 4 % (1 patient) in 41 noncirrhotic patients. Two patients who had undergone standard end-to-side hepaticojejunostomy required reoperation (Hepp procedures) for recurrent <b>strictures.</b> No recurrent <b>strictures</b> occurred with the use of the Hepp technique for hilar <b>strictures</b> or wide side-to-side anastomosis for lower <b>strictures.</b> None of these patients experienced episodes of ascending cholangitis. CONCLUSIONS. The Hepp approach provides a safe, durable, and highly effective solution to the problem of <b>strictures</b> of the bile duct, including hilar <b>strictures.</b> Transanastomotic tube stenting is not necessary...|$|R

25|$|Patients {{with mild}} to {{moderate}} ischemic colitis are usually treated with IV fluids, analgesia, and bowel rest (that is, no food or water by mouth) until the symptoms resolve.

Most patients make a full recovery; occasionally, after severe ischemia, patients may develop long-term complications such as a <b>stricture</b> or chronic colitis.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{investigate}} the added value of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) in differentiating benign from malignant extrahepatic biliary <b>strictures.</b> MethodsMagnetic resonance examination including, T 2 -weighted imaging, MRCP and DWI using different b-values (0, 500, 800 s/mm 2) were performed in 38 patients with suspicious extrahepatic biliary <b>strictures.</b> Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value was calculated. The signal {{intensity of the}} lesions on DWI using b= 500 and 800 s/mm 2 was examined. Analysis of the DWI and MRCP images {{for the cause of}} the extrahepatic biliary stricutre was performed. Patients were further confirmed by histopathological diagnosis and follow up. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive and negative predictive values were calculated for both the MRCP images and DWI. ResultsOf the 38 cases, 23 cases had malignant extrahepatic biliary <b>strictures</b> and 15 had benign <b>strictures.</b> DWI detected 21 out of the 23 malignant biliary <b>strictures</b> and 14 out of 15 benign biliary <b>strictures.</b> Malignant <b>strictures</b> more frequently appeared hyperintense than benign <b>strictures</b> on DWI using b-values of 500 and 800 s/mm 2.

40|$|Aim: To analyze {{clinical}} {{data from}} male patients treated with urethrotomy {{and to develop}} a clinical decision algorithm. Materials and methods: Two large cohorts of male patients with urethral <b>strictures</b> were included in this retrospective study, historical (1985 - 1995, n= 491) and modern cohorts (1996 - 2006, n= 470). All patients were treated with repeated internal urethrotomies (up to 9 sessions). Clinical outcomes were analyzed and systemized as a clinical decision algorithm. Results: The overall recurrence rates after the first urethrotomy were 32. 4 % and 23 % in the historical and modern cohorts, respectively. In many patients, the second procedure was also effective with the third procedure also feasible in selected patients. The <b>strictures</b> with a length ≤ 2 cm should be treated according to the initial length. In patients with <b>strictures</b> ≤ 1 cm, the second session could be recommended in all patients, but not with penile <b>strictures,</b> <b>strictures</b> related to transurethral operations or for patients who were 31 - 50 years of age. The third session could be effective in selected cases of idiopathic bulbar <b>strictures.</b> For <b>strictures</b> with a length of 1 - 2 cm, a second operation is possible for the solitary low-grade bulbar <b>strictures,</b> given that the age is > 50 years and the etiology is not post-transurethral resection of the prostate. For penile <b>strictures</b> that are 1 - 2 cm, urethrotomy could be attempted in solitary but not in high-grade <b>strictures.</b> Conclusions: We present data on the treatment of urethral <b>strictures</b> with urethrotomy from a single center.
