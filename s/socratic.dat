5|$|Slavery {{in ancient}} Greece {{was a common}} practice, as was slavery in other {{societies}} at the time. Some writers in ancient Greece (including, most notably, Aristotle) considered slavery natural and even necessary. This paradigm was notably questioned in <b>Socratic</b> dialogues; the Stoics produced the first recorded condemnation of slavery.|$|E
5|$|Xenophon {{mentions}} Aspasia {{twice in}} his <b>Socratic</b> writings: in Memorabilia and in Oeconomicus. In both cases her advice is recommended to Critobulus by Socrates. In Memorabilia Socrates quotes Aspasia {{as saying that}} the matchmaker should report truthfully on the good characteristics of the man. In Oeconomicus Socrates defers to Aspasia as more knowledgeable about household management and the economic partnership between husband and wife.|$|E
5|$|Its {{academic}} program {{is based on}} a core curriculum of sixteen required courses in the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. All courses are small seminars with no more than twelve students, and are based on original sources from a list of about 200 core texts broadly based on the Great Books canon. Classroom instruction is <b>Socratic</b> discussion. Considerable writing is required, including two comprehensive examinations and a senior thesis. Students are admitted primarily on the basis of essays and interviews; no minimum grades or test scores are required. Shimer {{has one of the highest}} alumni doctorate rates in the country.|$|E

5|$|Only two of {{the seven}} {{surviving}} plays can be dated securely: Philoctetes (409 BC) and Oedipus at Colonus (401 BC, staged after Sophocles' death by his grandson). Of the others, Electra shows stylistic similarities to these two plays, which suggests that it was probably written {{in the latter part}} of his career. Ajax, Antigone and The Trachiniae are generally thought to be among his early works, again based on stylistic elements, with Oedipus Rex coming in Sophocles' middle period. Most of Sophocles' plays show an undercurrent of early fatalism and the beginnings of <b>Socratic</b> logic as a mainstay for the long tradition of Greek tragedy.|$|E
25|$|Inspired {{and guided}} by Leo Strauss's revival of Platonic {{political}} philosophy, Pangle's work {{has as its}} unifying aim the clarification and defense of the original <b>Socratic</b> conception of political philosophy. In the manner that Pangle understands it, the <b>Socratic</b> conception is controversial.|$|E
25|$|The extant, {{primary sources}} {{about the history}} of the trial and {{execution}} of Socrates are: the Apology of Socrates to the Jury, by Xenophon of Athens, a historian; and the tetralogy of <b>Socratic</b> dialogues — Euthyphro, the <b>Socratic</b> Apology, Crito, and Phaedo, by Plato, a philosopher who had been a student of Socrates.|$|E
25|$|The major {{difference}} between Machiavelli and the <b>Socratics,</b> according to Strauss, is Machiavelli's materialism and therefore his rejection of both a teleological view of nature, and of the view that philosophy is higher than politics. With their teleological understanding of things, <b>Socratics</b> argued that desirable things tend to happen by nature, as if nature desired them, but Machiavelli emphasized that such things happen by blind chance, or human action.|$|R

25|$|Pangle's {{writings}} on ancient political philosophy attempt {{to show how}} <b>Socratic</b> arguments for the supremacy of the philosophic life shape, enrich, and ground the classical republican teaching on civic and moral virtue and on the spiritual goals of self-government.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the three}} epideictic orations of Isocrates {{which are in}} themselves a precious testimony {{of the quality of}} intellectual life {{at the close of the}} fourth century before Christ. To this period belong also the <b>Socratics</b> who are generally seen as an important link between Socrates and Plato. The author of this article proposes a more productive approach to the study of Antisthenes, Euclid of Megara and other so-called <b>Socratics,</b> revealing them not as independent thinkers but rather as adherents of the sophistic school and also as teachers, thereby, including them among those who took part in the educative activity of their tim...|$|R
50|$|The Axiochus—named after Axiochus, {{the uncle}} of Alcibiades—criticized Alcibiades {{for being a}} {{drunkard}} and a womanizer. Evidently, it was, like the Alcibiades, {{one of the many}} works that the <b>Socratics</b> published to clear Socrates of any blame for Alcibiades' corruption.|$|R
25|$|As {{delineated}} {{in various}} writings, the meticulousness, articulation, and sophistication with which Socrates spoke supplies an outstanding problem solving technique – the <b>Socratic</b> Method. The <b>Socratic</b> method may {{be described as}} follows: it usually involves others with whom Socrates directly engages (not merely pontificating to an audience), it involves a deep philosophical or ethical question to which an answer was sought, and it usually involves Socrates asking questions either to affirm his understanding of others or to seek their understanding.|$|E
25|$|The Apology of Socrates, by Plato, is a <b>Socratic</b> {{dialogue}} in three parts {{that cover the}} Trial of Socrates (399 BC): (i) the legal self-defence of Socrates, (ii) the verdict of the jury, and (iii) the sentence of the court.|$|E
25|$|Of all the {{classical}} philosophers, however, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle are generally {{considered the most}} important and influential. Socrates did not write any books himself and modern scholars debate whether or not Plato's portrayal of him is accurate. Some scholars contend that many of his ideas, or at least a vague approximation of them, are expressed in Plato's early <b>socratic</b> dialogues. Meanwhile, other scholars have argued that Plato's portrayal of Socrates is merely a fictional representation intended to expound Plato's own opinions who has {{very little to do with}} the historical figure of the same name. The debate over the extent to which Plato's portrayal of Socrates represents the actual Socrates's ideas is known as the <b>Socratic</b> problem.|$|E
5000|$|Döring's {{research}} {{focus was}} ancient Greek philology and its contemporary reception. He focussed {{on the various}} philosophical schools and movements (Sophism, Socrates, the <b>Socratics,</b> Plato, Cynicism and Stoicism). Until 1999 he was editor of the [...] (AKAN) series with Bernard Herzhoff and Georg Wöhrle.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to these, there were often histories of single schools. Such works {{were created by}} Phanias of Eresus (On the <b>Socratics),</b> Idomeneus of Lampsacus (On the <b>Socratics),</b> Sphaerus (On the Eretrian philosophers), and Straticles (On Stoics). Among the papyri found at the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum, there are works devoted to the successions of the Stoics, Academics, and Epicureans. In a later period, Plutarch produced On the First Philosophers and their Successors and On the Cyrenaics, and Galen wrote On Plato's Sect and On the Hedonistic Sect (Epicureans). There were often biographies of individual philosophers with {{a brief description of}} his successors. Of such nature were Aristoxenus's Life of Pythagoras, Andronicus's Life of Aristotle, Ptolemy's Life of Aristotle, and Iamblichus's Life of Pythagoras.|$|R

25|$|Socrates left no written works, but {{his student}} and friend, Plato, wrote <b>Socratic</b> dialogues, {{featuring}} Socrates as the protagonist. As a teacher, competitor intellectuals resented Socrates’s elenctic examination method for intellectual enquiry, because its questions threatened their credibility as men {{of wisdom and}} virtue.|$|E
25|$|To {{address the}} issue of {{apparently}} limited input, one must turn to what is possibly the most quoted of all arguments in support of universal grammar and its nativist interpretation – Plato's Problem. The phrase refers to the <b>Socratic</b> dialogue, the Meno; Noam Chomsky is often attributed with coining the term.|$|E
25|$|The {{four people}} {{appearing}} {{in those two}} dialogues are the politicians Critias and Hermocrates {{as well as the}} philosophers Socrates and Timaeus of Locri, although only Critias speaks of Atlantis. In his works Plato makes extensive use of the <b>Socratic</b> method in order to discuss contrary positions {{within the context of a}} supposition.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} two speeches about Socrates by Dion of Prusa On Socrates (Or. 54) and Socrates and Homer (Or. 55). The main Dionʼs {{argument is}} that Socrates {{was in fact a}} follower and a pupil of Homer. We argue for the historical veracity of such a view and substantiate Dionʼs argumentation by further evidence which {{can be found in the}} texts of other <b>Socratics,</b> mainly in Plato and Xenophon. Subsequently, we formulate the hypothesis, that the main source behind Dionʼs view about Socrates might be also Antisthenes, who was well established author of Homeric declamations in antiquity. We offer first Slovak translation of the Dionʼs speeches...|$|R
2500|$|Aristotle later {{created a}} {{systematic}} programme of philosophy which was teleological: Motion and change {{is described as}} the actualization of potentials already in things, according to what types of things they are. In his physics, the sun goes around the earth, and many things have {{it as part of}} their nature that they are for humans. Each thing has a formal cause, a final cause, and a role in a cosmic order with an unmoved mover. While the <b>Socratics</b> insisted that philosophy should be used to consider the practical question of the best way to live for a human being (a study Aristotle divided into ethics and political philosophy), they did not argue for any other types of applied science. Aristotle maintained that man knows a thing scientifically [...] "when he possesses a conviction arrived at in a certain way, and when the first principles on which that conviction rests are known to him with certainty".|$|R
5000|$|For the <b>Socratics,</b> human nature, and all natures, are metaphysical concepts. Aristotle {{developed}} the standard presentation {{of this approach}} with his theory of four causes. Every living thing exhibits four aspects or [...] "causes": matter, form, effect, and end. For example, an oak tree is made of plant cells (matter), grew from an acorn (effect), exhibits the nature of oak trees (form), and grows into a fully mature oak tree (end). Human nature {{is an example of}} a formal cause, according to Aristotle. Likewise, to become a fully actualized human being (including fully actualizing the mind) is our end. Aristotle (Nicomachean Ethics, Book X) suggests that the human intellect (νούς) is [...] "smallest in bulk" [...] but the most significant part of the human psyche, and should be cultivated above all else. The cultivation of learning and intellectual growth of the philosopher, which is thereby also the happiest and least painful life.|$|R
25|$|Among {{the primary}} sources {{about the trial}} and death of the philosopher Socrates (469–399 BC), the Apology of Socrates is the {{dialogue}} that depicts the trial, {{and is one of}} four <b>Socratic</b> dialogues, along with Euthyphro, Phaedo, and Crito, through which Plato details {{the final days of the}} philosopher Socrates.|$|E
25|$|Socrates on Trial (2007), by Andrew David Irvine, is a {{contemporary}} play that portrays Socrates as philosopher and man, based upon The Clouds (423 BC), by Aristophanes, and three <b>Socratic</b> dialogues, by Plato, the Apology of Socrates (the philosopher’s defence at trial), the Crito (discussion {{of the nature}} of Justice), and the Phaedo (discussion {{of the nature of}} the Afterlife).|$|E
25|$|Aristippus of Cyrene, a pupil of Socrates, founded {{an early}} <b>Socratic</b> school that {{emphasized}} {{only one side}} of Socrates's teachings - that happiness {{is one of the}} ends of moral action and that pleasure is the supreme good; thus a hedonistic world view, wherein bodily gratification is more intense than mental pleasure. Cyrenaics prefer immediate gratification to the long-term gain of delayed gratification; denial is unpleasant unhappiness.|$|E
5000|$|In Sophists, <b>Socratics</b> and Cynics, D. Rankin {{notes that}} Cercidas “was {{active in the}} {{politics}} of his city…and…was appointed nomothetes, or legislative commissioner, with the task of drawing up a new constitution”. But in his poetry, he was a harsh critic of the wealthy, and called for justice and revenge (Nemesis) upon them, also invoking Fortune, asking why she didn’t “reduce to poverty the profligate Xenon and give us the money now running to futility?”. He refers to the profligate wealthy as “dirty-cheat usurers” misusing their “stink-pig wealth”, as misers, and [...] "ruin merchants". He invokes Justice and asks why she - and all the gods on Olympus - are so blind. But most significant is his invocation of Nemesis, “the spirit of earthly retribution” to attack the wealthy for their profligacy and to attack the system of wealth itself, rather than specific acts of injustice or inequality - a profound theme of the Cynics.|$|R
5000|$|The term essentialist first {{appeared}} in the book An Introduction to the Philosophy of Education which was written by Michael John Demiashkevich. In his book, Demiashkevich labels some specific educators (including William C. Bagley) as “essentialists." [...] Demiashkevich compared the essentialists to the different viewpoints of the Progressive Education Association. He described how the Progressives preached a “hedonistic doctrine of change” whereas the essentialists stressed the moral responsibility of man for his actions and looked toward permanent principles of behavior (Demiashkevich likened the arguments to those between the <b>Socratics</b> and the Sophists in Greek philosophy). In 1938 Bagley and other educators met together where Bagley gave a speech detailing the main points of the essentialism movement and attacking the public education in the United States. One point that Bagley noted was that students in the U.S. were not getting an education on the same levels as students in Europe who were the same age.|$|R
2500|$|Rivers {{had visited}} his college {{frequently}} {{during the war}} although, having resigned his position as lecturer, he held no official post. However, upon his return from the Royal Air Force in 1919, the college created a new office for him – [...] "Praelector of Natural Science Studies" [...] – and {{he was given a}} free rein to do as he pleased. As Leonard E. Shore recalled in 1923: [...] "when I asked him if he would undertake that work... his eyes shone with a new light I had not seen before, and he paced his rooms for several minutes full of delight." [...] He took his new position to be a mandate to get to know every science student and indeed every other student at St. Johns, Cambridge, and at other colleges. He would arrange [...] "At Homes" [...] in his rooms on Sunday evenings, as well as Sunday morning breakfast meetings; he also organised informal discussions and formal lectures (many of which he gave himself) in the College Hall. He formed a group called The <b>Socratics</b> and brought to it some of his most influential friends, including H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett, Bertrand Russell and Sassoon. Sassoon (Patient B in Conflict and Dream), remained particularly friendly with Rivers and regarded him as a mentor. [...] They shared Socialist sympathies.|$|R
