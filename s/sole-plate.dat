50|$|In 1977, Bull's work put him {{in touch}} with (what is today) the Denel SOC Ltd company of South Africa. Denel {{designed}} a new mobile mounting that was {{able to handle the}} increased recoil. It used a <b>sole-plate</b> to lift the carriage to take the four wheels off the ground. The chassis had the option of being powered by a small diesel engine acting as an auxiliary power unit, driving hydraulics that could set up the gun in two minutes, and move it short distances. This feature had been previously been included in the 1960s design FH-70 carriage by Vickers. Bull, meanwhile, started production of $30 million worth of rounds, shipping them via Spain to avoid the international arms embargo against South Africa.|$|E
5000|$|This {{lighthouse}} {{was one of}} {{the first}} that Brunton designed and was also one of the most difficult to design. The island is situated in a turbulent part of the sea, and the sides of the island are very steep. Brunton wrote in an 1871 essay [...] that:The lighthouse is of stone, 58 feet high to the <b>sole-plate</b> of the lantern. It is in the shape of a truncated cone, and is surmounted by a capital having twenty-four Gothic arched recesses round it. The diameter at the base is 22 feet and at the top 16 feet. The thickness of the walls at the base is 6 feet and at the top 3 feet. It is fitted with a spiral staircase of keaki. The light shows all round the horizon, and a red ray of 55" [...] is inserted, which covers all dangers between it and the shore. The work of cutting away the rock to prepare for the foundations of the tower was commenced in April 1869, and the lighthouse was first illuminated on 1 January, 1871.|$|E
40|$|<b>Sole-plate</b> nuclei of the C 57 Bl/ 6 Jdy 2 j {{dystrophic}} mouse showed apparent selective {{susceptibility to}} {{various forms of}} structural alteration. Pyknosis and chromatin fragmentation were seen in addition to vacuolar and membranous nuclear inclusions. These were often associated with neuromuscular junctions with markedly reduced or virtually absent junctional folding. Membranous proliferations also occurred nearby <b>sole-plate</b> nuclei of such flattened junctions...|$|E
40|$|We have {{performed}} a morphometric {{analysis of the}} branching pattern of the rat sternomastoid motor nerve terminals in normal and regenerated singly-innervated synaptic areas, in junctions with an accessory ending and also in dually-innervated synaptic areas. We tried to seek measurable differences related to the terminal complexity and size in these different situations. The number of <b>sole-plate</b> nuclei is always significantly correlated with the nerve terminal parameters and unrelated to the muscle cell diameter. A significant correlation between the terminal complexity and the postsynaptic size is found only in the smallest endings whereas correlation is lost {{with the increase in}} nerve terminal complexity. In normal singly-innervated areas, the mean length of the distal free-end segments of the terminal arborisation becomes reduced with the increase in complexity of the terminals, whereas the mean length of the segments between branching points and the mean angle of branch emergence is, on average, constant. Whereas the accessory endings show the same branching pattern as the endings during the initial days of regeneration, the parent ending can be considered as a miniature version of the endings in normal singly-innervated junctions. In dually-innervated areas, the smallest endings show a similar branching pattern to the accessory endings and the endings during the initial process of reinnervation, whereas the larger endings show a significant reduction in the length of the distally placed segments compared to the normal endings in singly-innervated areas. Results indicate that the terminal branching pattern is not haphazard but, on the contrary, general rules and tendencies can be measured...|$|E
40|$|The Tanita body-fat {{analyser}} {{is a novel}} {{device to}} estimate body fat, based {{on the principles of}} bioelectrical impedance. It differs from other impedance systems which use surface electrodes in that the subjects stand bare-footed on a metal <b>sole-plate</b> which incorporates the electrodes, hence impedance is measured through the legs and lower trunk. In 104 men and 101 women (16 - 78 years and BMI 16 - 41 kg/m 2) the mean bias in body-fat mass measured using the Tanita body-fat analyser was 0. 8 (2 SD 7. 9) kg relative to a four-compartment model. This is comparable to the other prediction techniques tested (conventional tetrapolar impedance - 1. 3 (2 SD 6. 9) kg, skinfold thicknesses 0. 3 (2 SD 7. 4) kg, and BMI-based formulas - 0. 2 (2 SD 9. 0) kg and - 0. 6 (2 SD 8. 5) kg), but the agreement was poorer than for 'reference' methods to measure body fat (density 0. 2 (2 SD 3. 7) kg, total body water - 0. 9 (2 SD 3. 4) kg and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry 0. 1 (2 SD 5. 0) kg). The present paper also describes the derivation of a new prediction equation for the calculation of body composition from the Tanita body-fat analyser. The equation incorporates sex, age, and a log-transformation of height, weight and the measured impedance to predict body fat measured by a four-compartment model. This approach is recommended in the derivation of other prediction equations in body composition analysis. Using this novel prediction equation the residual standard deviations were 4. 8 % for men and 3. 3 % for women. A similar analysis using data collected with a conventional tetrapolar system yielded residual standard deviations of 4. 3 % for men and 3. 1 % for women. This demonstrates that the practical simplicity of the novel Tanita method is not associated with a clinically significant decrement in performance relative to a traditional impedance device...|$|E
