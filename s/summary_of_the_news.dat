50|$|Producers {{continued}} {{to use the same}} off-screen narrator,which made the Front Page Challenge footage less appealing to young people than the multiple sound bites featured by CBC Newsworld, which began 24-hour newscasts throughout Canada on July 31, 1989. CBC Newsworld offered sound bite interviews with people who had witnessed events or were knowledgeable about them. Young viewers using remote controls stuck with the multiple sound bites and ignored the Front Page Challenge narrator's <b>summaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> stories, according to the book by Alex Barris published in 1999.|$|R

50|$|The {{programme}} {{opened with}} a ten-minute <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> and, unlike Broadsheet, concentrated on more off-beat and light-hearted regional filmed reports and unscripted interviews from around Ireland.

50|$|CBS {{scheduled}} {{the half-hour}} {{program in the}} 10 a.m. timeslot on the East Coast. Since the network then believed women were the primary audience for daytime television, it created a substantive information program geared toward a female audience.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{our research}} on automatically generating rich semantic annotations of text {{and making it}} available on the Semantic Web. In particular, we discuss the challenges involved in adapting the OntoSem natural language processing system for this purpose. OntoSem, an implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> theory <b>of</b> ontological semantics under continuous development for over 15 years, uses a specially constructed NLP-oriented ontology and an ontological-semantic lexicon to translate English text into a custom ontology-motivated knowledge representation language, <b>the</b> language <b>of</b> text meaning representations (TMRs). OntoSem concentrates {{on a variety of}} ambiguity resolution tasks as well as processing unexpected input and reference. To adapt OntoSem results to the Semantic Web, we developed a translation system, OntoSem 2 OWL, between the TMR language into the Semantic Web language OWL. We next used OntoSem and OntoSem 2 OWL to support SemNews, an experimental web service that monitors RSS <b>news</b> sources, processes <b>the</b> <b>summaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> stories and publishes a structured representation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> meaning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> text in <b>the</b> <b>news</b> story.

50|$|On June 8, 2015, the {{newscast}} had premiered a new format, {{which includes}} more live reports and investigations about {{social and political}} issues, becoming less structured than the other bulletins of the other stations. A main story is presented during the first 20 or 40 minutes, a brief <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> follows immediately, and short segments of sport, international news, entertainment news and weather forecast are delivered too. The change of format have reduced {{the duties of the}} newsreaders: they almost don´t appear on stage and read a few lines during the broadcast, and sometimes they prepare special reports.|$|E
5000|$|The show now {{begins with}} the Handel on the News, segment {{previously}} heard in the show's second hour. [...] "Handel On The News" [...] is a <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> delivered with Handel's commentary played with appropriate music cues starting each story and playing [...] "under" [...] his delivery. In the second, third and fourth hour, Handel has guests to discuss topics in the news. Otherwise, he covers a single news story or item of interest for a half-hour, summarizing various other perspectives and offering his own opinion. Handel on the News: Late Edition airs at 9:30 am, is a condensed version of the 6 am hour, and includes stories not covered in the earlier version.|$|E
50|$|El gato al agua {{focuses on}} {{current and past}} {{political}} affairs in Spain, overstating hot topics involving left-side politicians in order to criticize them. There are usually four or five guests, usually from the most conservative scene, but also former Socialist politicians like Joaquin Leguina (former Socialist President of the Community of Madrid), Cristina Alberdi (former Minister of the Socialist Government of Felipe Gonzalez), Antonio Miguel Carmona (MP of the Socialist Party) or Xavier Nart, lawyer and self-declared as left-wing politically oriented, chaired by Antonio Jiménez. During the programme, viewers and listeners can vote via SMS for a guest, who eventually receives a cheap Cat statuette (named in the title), when the program finishes. They can also answer via SMS a closed question with two options (yes or no) relating to the current events talked about {{at the start of}} the programme. Apart from the debate, there are purely humoristic, unreliable opinion polls on the street and a <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> making the front pages of the following day.|$|E
50|$|Starting on 3 July 1880, {{a weekly}} digest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Gazette, {{including}} the main literary pieces and a <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> week's <b>news,</b> was published as the St James's Budget. After 1893 it {{was turned into}} an independent illustrated weekly, edited from the same office by J. Penderel-Brodhurst (later editor <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Guardian from 1905), {{who had been on}} the editorial staff since 1888; and it continued to be published till 1899 or until 1911.|$|R
5|$|Ice hockey {{receives}} little {{national media}} {{coverage in the}} United Kingdom. Some national newspapers list results and provide short <b>summaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> league's <b>news</b> but more extensive coverage remains minimal. There was a small surge in interest during the 2004–05 season when newspapers such as The Times reported on the NHL players playing the Elite League as a result <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lock-out but since the lock-out ended, coverage has returned to its previous levels.|$|R
5000|$|Abbot's {{show had}} a {{distinctive}} style among LBC presenters. It became normal for a <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> week's <b>news</b> {{to take place}} at <b>the</b> start <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show over his opening jingle, [...] "Boogie Woogie" [...] by Liberace (replacing the theme tune he had previously used: [...] "The Beautiful People" [...] by Marilyn Manson). During the show, he played various sound clips including quotes from films such as The Terminator, and clips from his former co-presenter Carol McGiffin.|$|R
5000|$|Many people send {{cards to}} both {{close friends and}} distant acquaintances, {{potentially}} making <b>the</b> sending <b>of</b> cards a multi-hour chore in addressing dozens or even hundreds <b>of</b> envelopes. <b>The</b> greeting in the card can be personalized but brief, or may include a <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> year's <b>news.</b> <b>The</b> extreme <b>of</b> this is <b>the</b> Christmas letter (below). Because cards are usually exchanged year after year, the phrase [...] "to be off someone's Christmas card list" [...] is used to indicate a falling out between friends or public figures.|$|R
50|$|Through <b>the</b> politenes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Epxress Company, we are {{permitted}} to forward by the first Pony Epxress, {{the first and only}} newspaper which goes out, and which will be the first paper ever transmitted from the Missouri to California in eight days. <b>The</b> nature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conveyance necessarily precludes out making up an edition of any considerable weight. It, however, contains a <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> latest <b>news</b> received here by telegraph for some days past, from all parts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Union.

5000|$|The main {{editorial}} policy of Il Foglio (meaning in Italian - [...] "The Sheet", i.e., formed {{from a single}} sheet of paper, as used in 19th century newspapers) is a <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most important <b>news</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day with comment and analysis on them. Recently <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paper has increased, with insert and extra pages incorporated especially on Saturday.|$|R
50|$|In November 1883, {{the company}} started putting out an {{afternoon}} two-page <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day's financial <b>news</b> called <b>the</b> Customers' Afternoon Letter. It soon achieved {{a circulation of}} over 1,000 subscribers and was considered an important news source for investors. It included the Dow Jones stock average, an index that included nine railroad issues, one steamship line, and Western Union.|$|R
5000|$|The {{magazine}} added [...] "The Monthly Rag", {{a feature}} similar to supermarket tabloids, presenting parody articles using various toy and pop culture references. (An {{example would be}} an article reporting on the intelligent design debate on the planet Cybertron, home <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robotic Transformers). Originally, this feature's main articles were humorous exaggerations of actual toy-related stories (such as <b>news</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> He-Man and <b>the</b> Masters <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Universe series' release on DVD, reported as [...] "Shocking He-Man Footage Made Public!"), and a sidebar column would appear somewhere within the [...] "Monthly Rag" [...] section with short <b>summaries</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> real <b>news</b> behind <b>the</b> exaggerated articles.|$|R
50|$|The hour {{began with}} 10 to 13 minutes of news {{presented}} by Dawley, the program's first newsreader until 1983, {{followed by a}} 2-minute weather update and a 10-minute documentary or interview. After a commercial break, national and international news would be presented, followed by a 5-minute sportscast. A full weather forecast of 5-minutes duration took place about 30 minutes into the program. Another documentary or interview segment filled in <b>the</b> rest <b>of</b> <b>the</b> time. Towards <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> program {{there would be a}} feature such as a review of an arts event, or a news-comedy skit. Each hour would end with a short <b>summary</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> day's <b>news.</b>|$|R
