The Honourable Mr Pelletier replied that the accounts were examined by Honourables Mr. Norquay and Mr. Begg representing the Province of Manitoba, and Messrs. McCall and Graham representing the Dominion Government. The resolution {{would be that the}} Government of Keewatin (Dominion Government) would pay $20,000 and the Government of Manitoba $5,000 in <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims.</b> [...] $20,000 is equivalent to $ in present-day terms and $5,000 is equivalent to $.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{possible}} that Grey's antipathy towards the Canterbury Association led him to appoint Campbell in order to frustrate the plans of the Colonists and delay the <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> and the issuing of pasturage licences. Certainly Campbell, and George Grey's appointment of him as Commissioner, were strongly criticized by the press and prominent colonists. The Lyttelton Times and the Daily Southern Cross published articles stating:"There never was a more unfortunate or more offensive appointment than that of Col. Campbell... he was considered by all who {{came in contact with}} him to be wholly incompetent to discharge the duties of any responsible station... there could hardly have been found another man whose presence within this settlement, as an official, would have been so offensive to its inhabitants." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the coming}} of winter, the {{deficiencies}} of the colony became apparent. Money pledged {{for the purchase of}} stock had not come in, housing was inadequate, and expenses of nearly $200 a day drained the colony's resources. Disillusionment set in among many of the participants that the enterprise, far from establishing a cooperative community of secure work and plenty, {{was little more than a}} land speculation scheme in a new guise. If this was not the original intent of the founders, within two years it became the practical reality of the enterprise, as the colony platted an overlooking bluff and sold lots there to outsiders as part of a subdivision called [...] "Edgewood". Amidst squabbling over finances and a shortage of ready cash, a wave of lawsuits ensued with 336 legal claims filed against the heavily mortgaged colony and its 196 separate notes and debts. Liquidation and the <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> took nearly a decade.|$|E

50|$|In the 1980s the {{government}} sought {{to sell the}} forests to private interests. Several Māori iwi went to Court to prevent the sale, arguing {{that they were the}} traditional owners of the land, that the land had been wrongfully taken from them, and that {{the government}} should retain the land until a <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> the <b>claims</b> had been reached. It has taken 20 years to reach <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> those <b>claims</b> and to see the forest lands returned to their traditional owners. On 1 July 2009, it passed to a group of tribes that were the traditional land owners in partial <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> their <b>claims</b> that the Crown breached the Treaty of Waitangi.

5000|$|Bolger's {{government}} settled {{three major}} claims under the Treaty of Waitangi. Largely {{due to the}} work of Bolger's Minister of Justice and Treaty Negotiations, Sir Douglas Graham, the Ngāi Tahu, Waikato-Tainui and fisheries settlements were reached. However, the creation of the so-called [...] "fiscal envelope" [...] of $1 billion for all <b>settlements</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> - an effective limit on what the Crown would pay out in settlements - by the Bolger government was an unpopular move with Māori.|$|R

50|$|The {{revenues}} of American Samoa {{for the fiscal}} years 2002 and 2003, which had been showing a downward trend, registered a substantial increase attributed to the insurance <b>settlement</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> made to cover the damages caused by Cyclone Val.
