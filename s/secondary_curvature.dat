40|$|Abstract Background For many years, the CD {{instrumentation}} {{has been}} regarded as the standard device for the surgical correction of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Nevertheless, scientific long-term results on this procedure are rare. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective follow-up study of patients treated for AIS with CD instrumentation and spondylodesis. Methods A total of 40 patients with AIS underwent CD instrumentation in our department within 3 [*]years and between 1990 and 1992. For the retrospective analysis, first all the patient documents were reviewed, and pre-/postoperative X-ray images {{as well as those}} at the latest follow-up were analysed. Furthermore, it was attempted to conduct a clinical survey using the SRS- 24 questionnaire, which was sent to the patients after a preceding announcement on the phone. Results Radiologically, the frontal main curvature was improved from a preoperative angle of 69. 2 ° to a postoperative angle of 35. 4 °, and the <b>secondary</b> <b>curvature</b> was improved from a preoperative angle of 42. 6 ° to a postoperative angle of 20. 5 °. The latest radiological follow-up at average 57. 4 [*]months post surgery showed an average loss of correction of 9. 6 ° (main curvature) and 4. 6 ° (<b>secondary</b> <b>curvature),</b> respectively. Within the first 30 [*]days post surgery, 3 out of 40 patients (7. 5 %) received early operative revision for the dislocation of hooks or rods. At an average of 45. 7 [*]months (range 11 to 142 [*]months), 19 out of 40 patients (47. 5 %; including 2 patients with early revision) received late operative revisions: The reasons were late infection (10 out of 40 patients; 25 %) with the development of fistulae (7 cases) or putrid secretion (3 cases), which was resolved with the complete removal of instrumentation after all. The average time until revision was 35. 5 [*]months (range 14 to 56 [*]months) after CD instrumentation. Furthermore, complete implant removal was necessary in 8 out of 40 patients (20 %) for late operate site pain (LOSP). The average time until removal of instrumentation was 62. 7 months (range 18 to 146 [*]months) post surgery; and one patient received partial device removal for prominent instrumentation 11 [*]months post surgery. Altogether, only 22 out of 40 CD instrumentations (55 %) were still in situ. After an average period of 14. 3 years post surgery, it was possible to follow-up 14 out of 40 patients (35 %) using the SRS- 24 questionnaire. The average score was 93 points, without showing significant differences between patients with or without their instrumentation in situ. Conclusions Retrospectively, we documented {{for the first time a}} very high revisions rate in patients with AIS and treated by CD instrumentation. Nearly half of the instrumentation had to be removed due to late infection and LOSP. The reasons for the high rate of late infections with or without fistulae and for LOSP were analysed and discussed in detail. </p...|$|E
40|$|In normal children, {{who usually}} learn to walk unaided {{before the age}} of two, the {{resultant}} change from a primary to <b>secondary</b> lumbar <b>curvature</b> is accompanied by a change in the relative position of the nucleus pulposus within the intervertebral disc, from a predominantly posterior situation to a central situation. During the third and fourth years of life, an increase in the rate of vertical growth of the L 4 - 5 "total disc", as measured at its centre, is associated with the gradual change from convexity to concavity {{in the shape of the}} bony vertebral end surfaces bounding the disc. In non-ambulant spastic children, the increased vertical growth of L 4 - 5 discs and the change in shape of the lumbar vertebral bodies, described in normal children, are not seen. In these non-ambulant children, though normal vertebral body heights are attained, the heights of the L 4 - 5 discs are severely reduced compared with normal heights for corresponding ages, and the anteroposterior diameters of lower lumbar vertebral bodies and discs are also more than two standard deviations below the corresponding norms. It is suggested that while vertical growth of the central region of lumbar vertebral bodies may be genetically determined and independent of mechanical factors, vertical growth of lumbar intervertebral discs and anteroposterior growth of lumbar vertebral bodies and discs are dependent on the activity associated with weight-bearing in the erect posture...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{application}} of Hough transform image processing technique to identify the existence of secondary flow patterns in a curved channel. When a fluid is forced through a passage with <b>curvature,</b> <b>secondary</b> flow appearing in spiral motion will superimpose on the main flow.

In addition to the highly complex nature of the secondary heat transfer process, it is difficult to quantify or measure the extent of the secondary flow.

A novel approach using an image processing technique based on the Hough transform is used to locate and extent of the secondary vortices.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{investigated}} {{section of}} the Lower Devonian La Vid Group (Cantabrian Zone, northern Spain) was deposited in a rifted-continental-margin setting, which in the Carboniferous evolved into a foreland basin, affected by Variscan thin-skinned folding and thrusting. Soon thereafter the originally linear orogenic belt underwent <b>secondary</b> <b>curvature,</b> forming the Variscan Ibero–Armorican Arc. This bending caused extension, crustal thinning, and strike-slip movements in the outer part of the orocline, to which the area of our investigation belongs. Subsequently the Variscan orogen subsided in Mesozoic and Cenozoic times, was covered by sediments of unknown thickness, and was affected by Alpidic tectonics. The Paleozoic Cantabrian Basin is an outcrop analogue for kilometer-scale differences in type and degree of porosity and cementation that can be expected in foreland basins of other areas as well. Origin of cements and related fluids in the La Vid carbonates can be described by three distinct fluid-evolution mechanisms: local in-situ fluid generation, mixing of external with internally generated fluids, and incursion of exotic fluids. The oldest recorded fluid belongs to the basin stage in pre-Variscan times. Upward migration of an in-situ generated fluid from underlying organic-rich shales through iron-rich sandstones into the carbonates of the La Vid Group was accompanied by the precipitation of various Fe-carbonates in various stratigraphic positions of this succession. Among the cements are ferroan saddle dolomites with inclusions of solid bitumen in the lower part and mature petroleum in {{the upper part of}} the succession. Assuming a commo...|$|E
40|$|Objective: {{to assess}} the {{efficacy}} and safety of using the gravitational cranial halo as a technique for treating rigid deformities in the spinal column and to revisit complications associated to the treatment. Methods: a total often patients with rigid spinal deformities were studied, with the following deformities: kyphosis, scoliosis, kyphoscoliosis and cervical hyperlordosis. The criterion for including a patient {{was the use of}} the gravitational cranial halo in a postoperative period and interoperative period for rigid spinal deformities. The patient medical records and their radiographic measurements were studied and compared in a preoperative period, after the installation of the gravitational cranial halo and in the postoperative period. The aspects analyzed were: age, sex, angular value of the main curvature and angular value of the <b>secondary</b> <b>curvature,</b> angular value of the major sagittal curvature, traction protocol and type of procedure. Results: in the frontal plane, an average angle of 89. 9 ° was found in the preoperative period, decreasing to 65 ° after the installation of the halo and 56. 9 ° in the postoperative period. In the sagittal plane, an angular value of 77. 7 ° was observed, decreasing to 55. 4 ° {{with the use of the}} halo and 46. 5 ° in the postoperative period.

40|$|We {{improved}} freeze-fracture {{electron microscopy}} to study synapses in the neuropil {{of the rat}} cerebral cortex at ∼ 2 nm resolution and in three-dimensions. In the pre-synaptic axon, we found that "rods" assembled from short filaments protruding from the vesicle and the plasma membrane connects synaptic vesicles to the membrane of the active zone. We equated these "connector rods" to protein complexes involved in "docking" and "priming" vesicles to the active zone. Depending on their orientation, the "rods" define two synaptic vesicle-fusion paths: When parallel to the plasma membrane, the vesicles hemi-fuse anywhere ("randomly") in the active zone following the conventional path anticipated by the SNARE hypothesis. When perpendicular to the plasma membrane, the vesicles hemi-fuse {{at the base of}} sharp crooks, called "indentations," that are spaced 75 - 85 nm center-to-center, arranged in files and contained within gutters. They result from primary and <b>secondary</b> membrane <b>curvatures</b> that intersect at stationary inflection ("saddle") points. Computer simulations indicate that this novel vesicle-fusion path evokes neurotransmitter concentration domains on the post-synaptic spine that are wider, shallower, and that reach higher average concentrations than the more conventional vesicle fusion path. In the post-synaptic spine, large (∼ 9 × ∼ 15 nm) rectangular particles at densities of 72 ± 10 / µm 2 (170 - 240 /spine) match the envelopes of the homotetrameric GluR 2 AMPA-sensitive receptor. While these putative receptors join clusters, called the "post-synaptic domains," {{the overwhelming majority of the}} rectangular particles formed bands in the "non-synaptic" plasma membrane of the spine. In conclusion, in the neuropil of the rat cerebral cortex, curvatures of the plasma membrane define a novel vesicle-fusion path that preconditions specific regions of the active zone for neurotransmitter release. We hypothesize that a change in the hybridization of the R-SNARE synaptobrevin from parallel to antiparallel swings the synapse into this novel vesicle-fusion path...|$|R

Therefore, a lower first molar was modelled and manufactured in an AISI 316 L stainless steel using selective laser melting technology, featuring the required multiplanar curvatures, which were confirmed by radiography. Thereafter, endodontic files were submitted to either rotational bending tests without back and forth motion (Group A) or rotational bending tests with back and forth motion (Group B) inside an artificial root canal with primary, <b>secondary</b> and tertiary <b>curvatures.</b> Time to fracture was recorded and fragments of the endodontic files tested were observed by optical microscopy.

All instruments fractured due to fatigue crack propagation. Hence, it was possible to conclude that back and forth motion extended the fatigue lifetime of the files tested once allowed diminishing the number of cycles with higher stress range applied, and spread the induced stresses by an enlarged area of the instrument. Additionally, almost plane surfaces were observed at fractured cross sections of the instruments tested, allowing to infer a very low influence of torsional loading when compared with bending...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDetermination of {{heat loads}} {{is a key}} issue {{in the design of}} gas turbines.

Heat transfer is influenced by various factors, like pressure distribution, wakes, surface <b>curvature,</b> <b>secondary</b> flow effects, surface roughness, free stream turbulence, and separation. Each of these phenomenons is a challenge for numerical simulations. Among numerical methods, large eddy simulations (LES) offers new design paths to diminish development costs of turbines through important reductions of the number of experimental tests. In this study, LES is coupled with a thermal solver in order to investigate the flow field and heat transfer around a highly loaded low pressure water-cooled turbine vane at moderate Reynolds number (150, 000). The meshing strategy (hybrid grid with layers of prisms at the wall and tetrahedra elsewhere) combined with a high fidelity LES solver gives accurate predictions of the wall heat transfer coefficient for isothermal computations. Mesh convergence underlines the known result that wall-resolved LES requires discretizations for which y+ is of the order of one. The analysis of the flow field gives a comprehensive view of the main flow features responsible for heat transfer, mainly the separation bubble on the suction side that triggers transition to a turbulent boundary layer and the massive separation region on the pressure side. Conjugate heat transfer computation gives access to the temperature distribution in the blade, which is in good agreement with experimental measurements. Finally, given the uncertainty on the coolant water temperature provided by experimentalists, uncertainty quantification allows apprehension of the effect of this parameter on the temperature distribution...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the relative advantage of using a helically coiled heat exchanger against a straight tube heat exchanger. It is found that the heat transfer in helical circular tubes is higher as compared to Straight tube due to their shape. Helical coils offer advantageous over straight tubes due to their compactness and increased heat transfer coefficient. The increased heat transfer coefficients are a consequence of the curvature of the coil, which induces centrifugal forces to act on the moving fluid, resulting in the development of <b>secondary</b> flow. The <b>curvature</b> of the coil governs the centrifugal force while the pitch (or helix angle) influences the torsion to which the fluid is subjected to the centrifugal force results in the development of secondary flow. Due to the curvature effect, the fluid streams in the outer side of the pipe moves faster than the fluid streams in the inner side of the pipe. In current work the fluid to fluid heat exchange is taken into consideration. Most of the investigations on heat transfer coefficients are for constant wall temperature or constant heat flux. The effectiveness, overall heat transfer coefficient, effect of cold water flow rate on effectiveness of heat exchanger when hot water mass flow rate is kept constant and effect of hot water flow rate on effectiveness when cold water flow rate kept constant studied and compared for parallel flow, counter flow arrangement of Helical coil and Straight tube heat exchangers.

40|$|Annular flumes {{are used}} for {{studying}} erosion and/or deposition of cohesive sediments in the laboratory. These flumes have advantages over straight recirculating flumes in that effects of inflow and outflow conditions are avoided {{and that there are}} no pumps which break down the suspended flocculated sediment. A disadvantage of annular flumes is that, because of the <b>curvature</b> <b>secondary</b> flow, velocities are generated in the flowing water, yielding a complex 3 -D flow field that is not well known up to now. The present report describes experiments in a rotating annular flume, Le. an annular flume in which not only the top lid rotates but the flume itself as well. The investigation is aimed at the accurate optimization of the ratio of rotational speeds of top lid and flume. Two different optimizing criteria were considered. The first criterion (criterion I) is the minimal intensity of secondary flow (especially in {{the lower part of the}} flume) and the second criterion (criterion IT) a uniform distribution of tangential velocity and of near bottom shear stress over the flume width. The measurements were done in a rotating annular flume with a mean diameter of 3. 7 m. Flow velocity measurements were done with a laser-Doppler velocimeter. The water depth, the rotational speeds of top lid and flume and the top lid width were varied. Minimal secondary flow circulations near the bottom of the flume are found to occur in conjunction with nearly uniform distributions, in the radial direction, of near bottom shear stresses. The investigation also shows that in situations where the near-bottom secondary flow circulations are minimal, the remaining secondary flow velocities are generally not small compared with cohesive-sediment fall velocities. This has implications for future studies of erosion, flocculation and deposition of cohesive sediments in rotating annular flumes. Another topic discussed is the generalization of the results obtained from the experiments. Conditions for (strict or only geometrical) similarity of flows in carousels are investigated. In case of similar flows, relations between optimum conditions can be deduced. An experimental verification of these relations is presented. A simplified analysis of the flow in carousels is given. This analysis provides a method to obtain several relations for carousel flow. With these relations it is possible to estimate the bottom shear stress and to compare non-similar carousel flows, for example. The relations obtained in this way are confronted with the experimental evidence. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|Turbulent {{three-dimensional}} {{flow separation}} {{is more complicated}} than 2 -D. The physics of the flow is not well understood. Turbulent flow separation is nearly independent of the Reynolds number, and separation in 3 -D occurs at singular points and along convergence lines emanating from these points. Most of the engineering turbulence research is driven by the need to gain knowledge of the flow field {{that can be used to}} improve modeling predictions. This work is motivated by the need for a detailed study of 3 -D separation in asymmetric diffusers, to understand the separation phenomena using eddy-resolving simulation methods, assess the predictability of existing RANS turbulence models and propose modeling improvements. The Cherry diffuser has been used as a benchmark. All existing linear eddy-viscosity RANS models k-ω SST,k-ϵ and v^ 2 -f fail in predicting such flows, predicting separation on the wrong side. The geometry has a doubly-sloped wall, with the other two walls orthogonal to each other and aligned with the diffuser inlet giving the diffuser an asymmetry. The top and side flare angles are different and this gives rise to different pressure gradient in each transverse direction. Eddy-resolving simulations using the Scale adaptive simulation (SAS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) method have been used to predict separation in benchmark diffuser and validated. A series of diffusers with the same configuration have been generated, each having the same streamwise pressure gradient and parametrized only by the inlet aspect ratio. The RANS models were put to test and the flow physics explored using SAS-generated 	flow field. The RANS model indicate a transition in separation surface from top sloped wall to the side sloped wall at an inlet aspect ratio much lower than observed in LES results. This over-sensitivity of RANS models to transverse pressure gradients is due to lack of anisotropy in the linear Reynolds stress formulation. The complexity of the flow separation is due to effects of lateral straining, streamline <b>curvature,</b> <b>secondary</b> flow of second kind, transverse pressure gradient on turbulence. Resolving these effects is possible with anisotropy turbulence models as the Explicit Algebraic Reynolds stress model (EARSM). This model has provided accurate prediction of streamwise and transverse velocity, however the wall pressure is under predicted. An improved EARSM model is developed by correcting the coefficients, which predicts a more accurate wall pressure. There exists scope for improvement of this model, by including convective effects and dynamics of velocity gradient invariants...|$|R
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of a hydraulic reaction turbine is significantly {{affected by the}} performance of its draft tube. The shape and velocity distribution at the inlet are, in next turn, two main factors that affects {{the performance of the}} draft tube. Traditionally, the design of this component has been based on simplified analytic methods, experimental rules of thumb and model tests. In the last decade or two, the usage of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has dramatically increased in the design process and will continue to grow due to is flexibility and cost-effectiveness. A CFD-based design search can further be aided with a robust and userfriendly optimization framework. Numerical prediction of the draft tube flow are, on the other hand, challenging and time consuming, caused by its complex flow features, e. g. unsteadiness, turbulence, separation, streamline <b>curvature,</b> <b>secondary</b> flow, swirl, and vortex breakdown. Hence, there is a great need of developing both accurate and reliable CFD models, together with efficient and effective optimization frameworks. In this work, a surrogate-based optimization (SBO) framework has been employed, in order to develop and implement a computer tractable approach to optimize the shape of hydraulic turbine draft tubes. By this methodology, one can replace the expensive CFD model with a surrogate model in the optimizations phase, in order to provide a faster and more effective exploration of the design and solution space. In addition, one gets a better insight into the true relationship between design variables and objective functions. Furthermore, this study has surveyed to enhance the quality and trust of non-trivial draft tube flow simulations. Mainly, since the initial CFD predictions were found to be in poor agreement with model tests, whereby the work has been split into two major parts, one concerning the SBO analysis and the other concerning the validity of the obtained CFD calculations. The outcome of this research, demonstrates the potential and benefits of using surrogate models in the design phase of hydraulic turbines draft tubes. For example, is the computational burden with a SBO framework drastically reduced, compared to solely utilizing a standard optimization framework. It is also preferable to test multiple surrogate models, since the prediction capabilities of it is highly problem dependent and the time cost of doing it is relatively low. The optimization results show moreover similar trends as model tests, illustrating the reliability of the approach. Some quantitative discrepancies are, however, found and it is recommended to further enhance the CFD simulations, by for instance include the runner geometry and/or use more advanced turbulence models in the calculations.

40|$|The {{sustainable}} development of rivers requires a knowledge on the three-dimensional mean flow {{field and the}} turbulence in complex morphologies. In a future, the computational capacity will be sufficient to simulate numerically the fine details of the flow. Our physical knowledge, however, is at present insufficient: {{the overwhelming majority of}} experimental research concerns straight-uniform flow and even complex numerical models are based on straight-uniform-flow knowledge. A sound understanding of the relevant physical processes will always be essential in complicated problems such as the river management, which concern a variety of different fields, and this irrespective of the available computational capacity. This PhD investigates, mainly experimentally, the mean-flow field and the turbulence in open-channel bends; this situation is considered as a generic case for complex highly three-dimensional flow. The experimental investigation is rendered feasible by the availability of a powerful Acoustic Doppler Velocity Profiler (ADVP), developed in our laboratory. The principal objectives of this PhD are: To provide a high-quality data base on three-dimensional open-channel flow, including all three mean velocity components and all six Reynolds stresses on a fine grid. To document interesting features of the flow field and the turbulence, such as the multi-cellular pattern of <b>secondary</b> circulation, the <b>curvature</b> influence on the turbulence, etc. To gain insight in the relevant physical mechanisms and processes underlying these features. To apply the acquired knowledge in an engineering sense, mainly by evaluating, improving and developing numerical simulation techniques. First, a limited series of experiments was conducted in a small laboratory flume, with the aim of testing the feasibility of the project. Subsequently, extended series of experiments have been designed in a large and optimized laboratory flume. The small-flume experiments yielded results beyond all expectations and form the core of this dissertation. The large-flume experiment are intended to confirm those results and to investigate newly emerged questions. Only few large-flume results are included in this dissertation; more large-flume results will be reported in literature in the future.   The structure of this dissertation follows the above-mentioned objectives. In PART I "Instrumentation and experimental set-up", the experimental set-up, the ADVP and the measuring strategy are presented. Furthermore, a method is proposed to improve acoustic turbulence measurements. PART II "Experimental observations" provides high-quality data on the mean flow and the turbulence and documents the most interesting features: The downstream velocity increases in outward direction and its vertical profiles are flatter (increased/decreased velocities in the lower/upper part of the flow depth) than in straight flow. A relatively small and weak outer-bank cell of secondary circulation exists besides the classical center-region cell (helical motion). The turbulence activity is reduced in the outer half of the cross-section in the investigated bend, as compared to a straight-uniform flow. Linear models that are commonly used to account for the effect of the secondary circulation in depth-integrated flow models are inaccurate for moderately to strongly curved flows. PART III "Fundamental research" investigates the physical mechanisms and processes underlying these observations, mainly by making term-by-term evaluations of the relevant flow equations (momentum, vorticity, turbulent kinetic energy) and by considering the instantaneous flow behavior. The distribution of the downstream velocity is dominated by both cells of secondary circulation, whereby the outer-bank cell has a protective effect on the stability of the outer bank by keeping the core of maximum velocity at distance. The center-region cell is mainly generated by the vertical gradient of the centrifugal force, : the non-uniform outward centrifugal force and the nearly-uniform inward pressure gradient, due to the super-elevation of the water surface, are on the average in equilibrium; their local non-equilibrium, however, gives rise to the centerregion cell. There exists a strong negative feedback between the vertical profile of the downstream velocity, vs, and the center-region cell: the center-region cell flattens the vs-profiles, which on its turn leads to a reduction of and a weakening of the center-region cell. Linear models that are commonly used to account for the effect of the secondary circulation in depth-integrated flow models perform poorly because they neglect this feedback. Similar outer-bank cells exist in straight turbulent flow as well as in curved laminar flow. In straight turbulent flow, they are induced by the anisotropy of turbulence whereas they come into existence in curved laminar flow when the curvature exceeds a critical value: the vs-profiles flatten {{to such an extent that}} the gradient of the centrifugal force changes sign near the water surface,  <  0, provocating the generation of the outer-bank cell. In curved turbulent flow, both mechanisms have a comparable contribution to the generation of the outer-bank cell and strengthen each other, whence the outer-bank cell is stronger in a curved turbulent flow than in a curved laminar or a straight turbulent flow. The restitution of kinetic energy from the turbulence to the mean flow plays an important role in the generation of the outer-bank cell, and the deficiency of standard k-ε turbulence closures to accurately simulate them is due to their inherent incapability to account for such kinetic-energy restitution. The turbulence structure is fundamentally different than in a straight-uniform flow: for the same amount of turbulent kinetic energy, there is less shear in a curved flow. This change in turbulence structure is responsible for the observed reduced turbulence activity. An analysis of the instantaneous flow behavior suggests that the turbulence fluctuations can be decomposed into two fundamentally different parts: a wave-like oscillation of the pattern of circulation cells embedded in background turbulence. PART IV "Applied research" tries to apply the acquired knowledge in an engineering sense. It proposes a non-linear model to account for the effect of the secondary circulation in depth-integrated flow models, that simulates the negative feedback between the downstream velocity profile and the center-region cell. Contrary to the commonly used linear models, this non-linear model agrees well with experimental data for strongly curved flow from both the small and the large-flume experiments. The model depends on the curvature ratio, the friction factor and the spanwise distribution of the downstream velocity, which can all be incorporated in a newly defined bend parameter, that allows an objective definition of weak, moderate and strong curvature. The linear model is found as the asymptotic solution for vanishing curvature. An evaluation for natural rivers has shown that differences between the linear model and the non-linear model are relevant. Moreover, outer-bank cells have been successfully simulated by means of a non-linear k-ε turbulence closure. As mentioned before, the small-flume experiments yielded results beyond all expectations. As a side-effect, the analysis of the large-flume experiments could not be accomplished within this dissertation and the work that is presently in progress is briefly described in PART V "Work in progress". Finally, PART VI summarizes the main conclusions of this dissertation...|$|R
