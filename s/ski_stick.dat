5000|$|An {{early start}} for the ascent to {{the rim of the}} Kibo Crater between the Rebmann and Ratzel Glaciers, (4 hours). The last section before the rim can {{sometimes}} be snow-covered and an ice-axe or <b>ski</b> <b>stick</b> is useful for balance. From here, a further hour leads to Uhuru Peak, from where there are often fine views of Meru to the west and the jagged peak of Mawenzi to the east. After a short time on the summit, descend to the Barafu Hut before continuing on down to camp at Mweka Hut in the giant heather zone on the Mweka route.|$|E
5000|$|An {{early start}} for the ascent to {{the rim of the}} Kibo Crater between the Rebmann and Ratzel Glaciers, (6 hours). The last section before the rim can {{sometimes}} be snow-covered and an ice-axe or <b>ski</b> <b>stick</b> is useful for balance. At the rim, Stella point is reached (18,652 feet (5,685 m)). From here, a further hour leads to Uhuru Peak, from where there are often fine views of Meru to the west and the jagged peak of Mawenzi to the east. Descend to the Barafu Hut (3 hours) for a rest and lunch before continuing on past Millenium camp down to camp at Mweka Hut in the giant heather zone on the forest edge (4 hours). Those with energy on the summit may wish to descend to the Reutsh Crater and visit the ice pinnacles of the Eastern Icefields.|$|E

He found the [...] "house party" [...] was only 13 people {{in the first week}} and none in the second week. Mr Weibel could not speak English. As Lord Denning MR said, ...|$|R
30|$|Hazelnut (Corylus avellana) {{sticks out}} {{of the group of}} shrubs. It was the most {{utilized}} shrub, ranking on its own in eighth place of the most utilized species (Fig.  1). In contrast to most other shrubs, hazelnut was not used because of its high density. It was used because of its high flexibility (not shown) and good fissility (Fig.  4). Therefore, it was used for barrel hoops and for all basket-works (more than 50  % of all wattle was made of hazelnut). Furthermore it was utilized for tool handles, walking <b>sticks</b> and <b>skiing</b> <b>sticks.</b> The literature also mentions hazel for the same field of application [17] or [18].|$|R
50|$|Similar to the modern, fast, free, and {{equipment}} light Alpine climbing ideals, modern manhaul purists seek to achieve mileage on their journey where possible solely {{through their own}} physical efforts. Most adherents would accept however that, it is acceptable to augment this pure, non-mechanically assisted travel, {{by the use of}} <b>skis</b> or <b>ski</b> <b>sticks</b> if travelling across snow bound terrain. In polar or extreme regions, humans are almost totally kit dependent, {{and equipment}} quality and selection is vital - but nevertheless the whole philosophy in any such voluntary activity (or sport) in a modern setting is that a balance is chosen between 'challenge' and 'accomplishment'. And so, as Scott himself has said, it is accepted that a certain element of discomfort is to be accepted, indeed welcomed - the human condition, makes it hard to disentangle a glowing sense of achievement from testing physical and mental tasks.|$|R
50|$|Shagbark hickory wood is {{used for}} smoking meat and for making the bows of Native Americans of the {{northern}} area. The lumber is heavy, hard, and tough, weighing 63 lb/ cu ft when air-dried, and has been employed for implements and tools that require strength. These include axles, axe handles, ploughs, <b>skis,</b> and drum <b>sticks.</b>|$|R
25|$|Amroy Europe Oy {{manufactures}} Hybtonite carbon nanoepoxy resins where carbon nanotubes {{have been}} chemically activated to bond to epoxy, {{resulting in a}} composite material that is 20% to 30% stronger than other composite materials. It {{has been used for}} wind turbines, marine paints and a variety of sports gear such as <b>skis,</b> ice hockey <b>sticks,</b> baseball bats, hunting arrows, and surfboards.|$|R
50|$|The 4,600-year-old rock {{drawings}} at Rødøy, which {{depict a}} man on <b>skis</b> holding a <b>stick,</b> is the oldest known reference of skis being used. The location is somewhat surprising, as this island has unreliable snow cover, and the Scandinavian climate was warmer in the Stone Age.This rock drawing {{was used as a}} pictogram in the Lillehammer Olympic Games in 1994.|$|R
50|$|Tachov {{is a city}} {{situated}} in the west part of the Czech Republic {{very close to the}} German border, and it lies in the middle of protected landscape area known as the Czech Forest. There is a one river flowing through the town and the whole region of Tachov, the river Mže. Tachov occupies an area of 4 095 ha and has about 12 640 inhabitants. This interesting town {{is a part of the}} Plzeň County, but the City of Tachov is divided into small neighborhoods like Biletín, Malý Rapotín, Mýto, Oldřichov, Světce, Velký Rapotín, and Vítkov. The head of the city is Jiří Struček. He is also at the same time a deputy governor of Pilsen Region. Although the district is mostly agricultural, Tachov has more of engineering industry and machinery. Some of the products that are manufactured here are molds for plastic injection, <b>ski</b> <b>sticks,</b> doors, windows, or many different types of components for car industry. Also, if you are a fan of good beer, in local restaurants and pubs you can have a taste of Chodovar, beer with a long tradition and good reputation, which is produced in a brew - house that lies in the village close to Tachov. The transport is realized by bus or by train. Tachov was built up in the valley surrounded by a variety of landscapes, and so you can find green forests, woods, and hills as well as wide fields with yellow turnip around here. Thanks to its historical and cultural wealth, it is a great touristic place and it offers a lot of activities to do. Though it is just a small town, Tachov has its own unforgettable beauty.|$|R
5000|$|Hickory wood is very hard, stiff, {{dense and}} shock resistant. There are woods that are {{stronger}} than hickory and woods that are harder, but the combination of strength, toughness, hardness and stiffness found in hickory wood is not found in any other commercial wood. [...] It is used for tool handles, bows, wheel spokes, carts, drumsticks, lacrosse stick handles, golf club shafts (sometimes still called hickory stick, even though made of steel or graphite), the bottom of <b>skis,</b> walking <b>sticks</b> and for punitive use as a switch (like hazel), and especially as a cane-like hickory stick in schools and use by parents. Paddles are often made from hickory. This property of hickory wood has left a trace in some Native American languages: in Ojibwe, hickory is called [...] "mitigwaabaak", a compound of mitigwaab [...] "bow" [...] and the final -aakw [...] "hardwood tree" ...|$|R
50|$|Many {{other types}} of sports and {{recreation}} equipment, such as <b>skis,</b> ice hockey <b>sticks,</b> lacrosse sticks and archery bows, were commonly made of wood in the past, but have since been replaced with more modern materials such as aluminium, titanium or composite materials such as fiberglass and carbon fiber. One noteworthy example of this trend is the golf club {{commonly known as the}} wood, the head of which was traditionally made of persimmon wood {{in the early days of}} the game of golf, but is now generally made of synthetic materials.|$|R

50|$|The National Science Foundation {{decided to}} send a {{military}} plane to airdrop supplies and medication for her treatment. Such airdrops had been a yearly event several years earlier, when the station was run by the US Navy, but had later been stopped. The plane did not attempt a landing because its <b>skis</b> would risk <b>sticking</b> to the ice and its fuel and hydraulic lines would rapidly freeze, dooming the craft. South Pole workers lit fires in barrels in the Antarctic night to mark out a drop zone. An Air Force C-141 cargo plane, staged out of Christchurch, overflew the Pole {{in the darkness of}} mid-July and sent six bundles of supplies and medical equipment parachuting toward the station.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} Scandinavian {{examples of}} skiing date to 5000 BCE with primitive carvings, which depict a skier with one pole, found in Rødøy in the Nordland region of Norway. Rock drawings in Norway dated at 4000 BC depict {{a man on}} <b>skis</b> holding a <b>stick.</b> The first primitive Scandinavian ski {{was found in a}} peat bog in Hoting in Jämtland County in Sweden which dates back to 4500 or 2500 BCE. In 1938 a ski was found from Salla, Finland that has been dated back to 3245 BCE. Noted examples are the Kalvträskskidan ski, found in Sweden and dated to 3300 BCE, and the Vefsn Nordland ski, found in Norway and dated to 3200 BCE. A ski excavated in Greenland is dated to 1010.|$|R
