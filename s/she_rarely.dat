5|$|In England, Anne largely {{turned from}} {{political}} {{to social and}} artistic activities. Though she participated fully {{in the life of}} James' court and maintained a court of her own, often attracting those not welcomed by James, <b>she</b> <b>rarely</b> took political sides against her husband. Whatever her private difficulties with James, she proved a diplomatic asset to him in England, conducting herself with discretion and graciousness in public. Anne played a crucial role, for example, in conveying to ambassadors and foreign visitors the prestige of the Stuart dynasty and its Danish connections.|$|E

5|$|Hepburn {{was known}} for being {{fiercely}} private, and would not give interviews or talk to fans for much of her career. She distanced herself from the celebrity lifestyle, uninterested in a social scene she saw as tedious and superficial, and she wore casual clothes that went strongly against convention {{in an era of}} glamour. <b>She</b> <b>rarely</b> appeared in public, even avoiding restaurants, and once wrestled a camera out of a photographer's hand when he took a picture without asking. Despite her zeal for privacy, she enjoyed her fame, and later confessed that she would not have liked the press to ignore her completely. The protective attitude thawed as she aged; beginning with a two-hour-long interview on The Dick Cavett Show in 1973, Hepburn became increasingly open with the public.|$|E

Meanwhile, the gentleman with thistle-down hair takes a liking to Stephen Black, Sir Walter's butler, and promises {{to make him a}} king. Emma (now Lady Pole) lapses into lassitude. <b>She</b> <b>rarely</b> speaks, and her attempts to communicate her situation are confounded by magic. Without the knowledge of the other characters, each evening she and Stephen are forced to attend balls held by the gentleman with thistle-down hair in the Faerie kingdom of Lost-Hope, where they dance all night long.|$|E
5000|$|To {{this mix}} of people comes {{a group of}} {{scientists}} from the company. This is where we meet Kumiko and her parents. Kumiko is the typical spoilt daughter of her very successful father and mother who both specialise in seismology. <b>She's</b> <b>rarely</b> been away from Earth and getting [...] "thrown into the deep end" [...] presents us with a hostile young lady.

25|$|My sister's {{disposition}} was not naturally gregarious; circumstances favoured and fostered her {{tendency to}} seclusion; except {{to go to}} church or take a walk on the hills, <b>she</b> <b>rarely</b> crossed the threshold of home. Though her feeling for the people round was benevolent, intercourse with them she never sought; nor, with very few exceptions, ever experienced. And yet she knew them: knew their ways, their language, their family histories; she could hear of them with interest, and talk of them with detail, minute, graphic, and accurate; but WITH them, <b>she</b> <b>rarely</b> exchanged a word.|$|E
25|$|The Wasp's genetic {{modifications}} also grant her {{the ability}} to sprout small prehensile antennae from her temples which allowed her to telepathically communicate with and control insects. However, this is an ability <b>she</b> <b>rarely</b> uses.|$|E

Taking a huge step out of her comfort zone and knowing no one, Carla relocated to Melbourne, determined to establish a new life for herself.
