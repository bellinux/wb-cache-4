25|$|After Belgium, McLaren's Goodyear tyres {{suffered}} a slump in competitiveness {{and the team}} and their car fell behind rivals Graham Hill in his Lotus and Stewart in his Matra. At the Dutch Grand Prix McLaren crashed out and Hulme retired with ignition failure. After Lotus had begun the first experimentation with wings in Monaco and Ferrari and Brabham had debuted full height wings in Belgium, McLaren fitted a rear wing to their car for the French Grand Prix. However, mounted above the engine on the <b>sprung</b> <b>mass</b> of the car, {{it was not as}} effective as Lotus's wing mounted on the unsprung suspension components. In France Hulme was fourth, then fifth in Britain but both cars were out of the points-earning positions at the German Grand Prix.|$|E
50|$|In {{a vehicle}} suspension, roll moment {{is the moment}} of inertia of the vehicle's <b>sprung</b> <b>mass</b> (the portion of its weight {{supported}} by the suspension). The roll moment {{is the product of}} the <b>sprung</b> <b>mass</b> and the square of the distance between the vehicle's roll center and its center of mass. If the vehicle is subjected to centrifugal forces, such as in a turn, the roll moment will cause the body to rotate (lean) towards the outside of the turn.|$|E
50|$|Roll rate is {{analogous}} to a vehicle's ride rate, but for actions that include lateral accelerations, causing a vehicle's <b>sprung</b> <b>mass</b> to roll about its roll axis. It is expressed as torque per degree of roll of the vehicle <b>sprung</b> <b>mass.</b> It is influenced by factors including {{but not limited to}} vehicle <b>sprung</b> <b>mass,</b> track width, CG height, spring and damper rates, roll center heights of front and rear, anti-roll bar stiffness and tire pressure/construction. The roll rate of a vehicle can, and usually does, differ front to rear, which allows for the tuning ability of a vehicle for transient and steady state handling. The roll rate of a vehicle does not change the total amount of weight transfer on the vehicle, but shifts the speed at which and percentage of weight transferred on a particular axle to another axle through the vehicle chassis. Generally, the higher the roll rate on an axle of a vehicle, the faster and higher percentage the weight transfer on that axle.|$|E
40|$|A direct {{approach}} {{is used to}} derive the exact solution for the free vibration of thin rectangular plates with discrete <b>sprung</b> <b>masses</b> attached. The plate is simply supported along two opposite edges and elastically supported along the two other edges. The elastic support can represent a range of boundary conditions from free to clamped supports. Considering only the compatibility of the internal forces between the plate and the <b>sprung</b> <b>masses,</b> the equations of the coupled vibration of the plate-spring-mass system are derived. The exact expressions for mode and frequency equations of the coupled vibration of the plate and <b>sprung</b> <b>masses</b> are determined. The solutions converge steadily and monotonically to exact values. The correctness and accuracy of the solutions are demonstrated through comparison with published results. A parametric study is undertaken focusing on the plate {{with one or two}} <b>sprung</b> <b>masses.</b> The results {{can be used as a}} benchmark for further investigation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{new version}} {{differential}} quadrature method is proposed {{to obtain the}} vibration characteristics of rectangular plates resting on elastic foundations and carrying any number of <b>sprung</b> <b>masses.</b> The accuracy of the technique is demonstrated by comparing the calculated re-sults with the published data. The non-uniform grid spacing is used in this work. The results also demonstrate {{the efficiency of the}} method in treating the vibration problem of the rectangular plates carrying any number of <b>sprung</b> <b>masses</b> and resting on the elastic foundations...|$|R

5000|$|Accelerometer Based Systems: These use an {{accelerometer}} {{to measure}} the relative motion of the <b>sprung</b> <b>mass,</b> corrected (sometimes) for the unsprung mass. Examples of these are the early ARAN systems (Canada) and the ARRB Roughometer (Australia).|$|E
50|$|Jacking {{forces are}} {{the sum of}} the {{vertical}} force components experienced by the suspension links. The resultant force acts to lift the <b>sprung</b> <b>mass</b> if the roll center is above ground, or compress it if underground. Generally, the higher the roll center, the more jacking force is experienced.|$|E
5000|$|Wheel {{rates are}} usually summed and {{compared}} with the <b>sprung</b> <b>mass</b> of a vehicle to create a [...] "ride rate" [...] and corresponding suspension natural frequency in ride (also referred to as [...] "heave"). This {{can be useful in}} creating a metric for suspension stiffness and travel requirements for a vehicle.|$|E
50|$|An early {{solution}} to oscillating <b>spring</b> <b>mass</b> was the mousetrap or hairpin springused on Norton Manxengines. These avoided resonance but were ungainly to locate inside cylinder heads.|$|R

50|$|Wheel sensors {{along the}} tracks feel for flat {{spots on the}} train's wheels. Any flat wheel that becomes too {{dangerous}} to travel on (a big flat spot on the train wheel) will be counted as a defect. Typically, these systems utilise accelerometers, strain gauges, fibre optic methods, or the very latest (WIPD) wheel impact phase detector. A wheel impact load detector (WILD) measures impacts, but does not normalise these impact measurements against anything: simply the impact reading. They do not attempt to cater for differences in <b>sprung</b> <b>mass,</b> as they are measuring wheel defect impact rather than impact load. Therefore, the same wheel defect will register a much larger impact when a wagon is loaded, versus when it is empty.A wheel condition monitoring detector monitors {{the condition of the}} wheel independent of <b>sprung</b> <b>mass</b> - independent of load. They do this by subtracting the wheel mass to get the normalised impact value. These systems are therefore typically better at detecting smaller defects with greater resolution.|$|E
5000|$|The {{location}} of the geometric roll center is solely dictated by the suspension geometry, {{and can be found}} using principles of the instant center of rotation. The SAE's definition of the force based roll center is, [...] "The point in the transverse vertical plane through any pair of wheel centers at which lateral forces may be applied to the <b>sprung</b> <b>mass</b> without producing suspension roll".|$|E
50|$|In a {{turn the}} <b>sprung</b> <b>mass</b> of the vehicle's body {{produces}} a lateral {{force at the}} centre of gravity (CG), proportional to lateral acceleration. Because the CG is usually not on the roll axis, the lateral force creates a moment about the roll axis that tends to roll the body. (The roll axis is a line that joins {{the front and rear}} roll centers (SAEJ670e)). The moment is called the roll couple.|$|E
40|$|Humans {{and birds}} both walk and run bipedally on {{compliant}} legs. However, differences in leg architecture {{may result in}} species-specific leg control strategies {{as indicated by the}} observed gait patterns. In this work, control strategies for stable running are derived based on a conceptual model and compared with experimental data on running humans and pheasants (Phasianus colchicus). From a model perspective, running with compliant legs can be represented by the planar <b>spring</b> <b>mass</b> model. However, to compare experimental data to simulated <b>spring</b> <b>mass</b> running, an effective leg stiffness has to be defined. In chapter 2, different methods of estimating a leg stiffness during running are compared to running patterns predicted by the <b>spring</b> <b>mass</b> model, and a new method only relying on temporal parameters is proposed and used in the further course of this work. It has been shown that <b>spring</b> <b>mass</b> running is self-stabilizing for sufficiently high running speeds. However, to provide stability over a broader range of running, control strategies can be applied and swing leg control is one elegant approach to stabilize the running pattern, while maintaining the system energy conservative. Here, linear adaptations of the swing leg parameters, leg angle, leg length and leg stiffness, are assumed. Experimentally observed kinematic control parameters (leg rotation and leg length change) of running humans (chapter 3 and 4) and pheasants (chapter 4) are compared, and interpreted within the context of this model, with specific focus on stability and robustness characteristics...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>spring's</b> <b>mass</b> {{increases}} {{whenever it}} {{is put into}} compression or tension. Its added mass arises from the added potential energy stored within it, which is bound in the stretched chemical (electron) bonds linking the atoms within the spring.|$|R

The uprising was initially against unemployment, economic conditions, and corruption, {{as well as}} against the government's proposals to modify the constitution of Yemen so that Saleh's son could inherit the presidency.|$|R
50|$|Weight {{transfer}} {{occurs as}} the vehicle's CoM shifts during automotive maneuvers. Acceleration causes the <b>sprung</b> <b>mass</b> to rotate about a geometric axis resulting in relocation of the CoM. Front-back weight transfer {{is proportional to}} the change in the longitudinal location of the CoM to the vehicle's wheelbase, and side-to-side weight transfer (summed over front and rear) {{is proportional to the}} ratio of the change in the CoM's lateral location to the vehicle's track.|$|E
50|$|Roll {{center height}} {{is a product}} of {{suspension}} instant center heights and is a useful metric in analyzing weight transfer effects, body roll and front to rear roll stiffness distribution. Conventionally, roll stiffness distribution is tuned adjusting antiroll bars rather than roll center height (as both tend to have a similar effect on the <b>sprung</b> <b>mass),</b> but the height of the roll center is significant when considering the amount of jacking forces experienced.|$|E
50|$|In {{a vehicle}} with a suspension, {{such as an}} automobile, {{motorcycle}} or a tank, <b>sprung</b> <b>mass</b> (or sprung weight) is {{the portion of the}} vehicle's total mass that is supported above the suspension, including in most applications approximately half of the weight of the suspension itself. The sprung weight typically includes the body, frame, the internal components, passengers, and cargo, but does not include the mass of the components suspended below the suspension components (including the wheels, wheel bearings, brake rotors, calipers, and/or Continuous tracks (Also called caterpillar tracks), if any), which are part of the vehicle's unsprung weight.|$|E

50|$|The Rayleigh-Ritz {{method is}} often used in {{mechanical}} engineering for finding the approximate real resonant frequencies of multi degree of freedom systems, such as <b>spring</b> <b>mass</b> systems or flywheels on a shaft with varying cross section.

50|$|In {{a ground}} vehicle with a suspension, the {{unsprung}} mass (or the unsprung weight) is {{the mass of}} the suspension, wheels or tracks (as applicable), and other components directly connected to them, rather than supported by the suspension. (The mass of the body and other components supported by the suspension is the <b>sprung</b> <b>mass.)</b> Unsprung mass includes the mass of components such as the wheel axles, wheel bearings, wheel hubs, tires, and a portion of the weight of driveshafts, springs, shock absorbers, and suspension links. If the vehicle's brakes are mounted outboard (i.e., within the wheel), their mass (weight) is also considered part of the unsprung mass.|$|E
50|$|Unsprung mass {{is largely}} a {{function}} of the design of a vehicle's suspension and the materials used in the construction of suspension components. Beam axle suspensions, in which wheels on opposite sides are connected as a rigid unit, generally have greater unsprung mass than independent suspension systems, in which the wheels are suspended and allowed to move separately. Heavy components such as the differential can be made part of the <b>sprung</b> <b>mass</b> by connecting them directly to the body (as in a de Dion tube rear suspension). Lightweight materials, such as aluminum, plastic, carbon fiber, and/or hollow components can provide further weight reductions at the expense of greater cost and/or fragility.|$|E

In the mobility analogy the symbols are reversed, being respectively velocity and force generators.|$|R
50|$|In {{traditional}} spring based heave {{compensation systems}} {{the movement of}} the mass is parallel to {{the movement of the}} spring cylinder. A passive heave compensation system is in effect a <b>mass</b> <b>spring</b> system, it stabilizes a certain mass in a single position of the spring, in that position only the <b>spring</b> and the <b>mass</b> are balanced. In other positions of the <b>spring</b> the <b>mass</b> and the <b>spring</b> are not balanced and the mass will tend to start moving towards the stabilized position due to residual forces in the spring. Therefore, only in certain (preset) conditions a <b>mass</b> <b>spring</b> system can be beneficial for heave compensation. In other (unexpected) conditions, <b>mass</b> <b>spring</b> systems may experience unwanted effects such as load amplification. An active heave compensation system adds an active component to a passive heave compensation system in order to counteract these residual forces.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} of the possibilities of realtime surgical simulation, specifically within the domain of congenital heart diseases. The problem domain of surgery on the heart of an infant is presented and the primary information necessary for a pre-operative surgical simulation tool is identified. Through cooperation with surgeons, domain specific abstractions and simplifications with respect to soft tissue simulation is identified and used in the investigation of models for tissue deformation. In general {{it is not possible to}} calculate the deformation of tissue precisely in realtime. We therefore need to use simplified elastic models that approximate the real behavior of tissue. The most popular models for realtime interaction and response; the Finite Element model and the <b>Spring</b> <b>Mass</b> model are presented and discussed with respect to to surgery on the heart of an infant. A number of variations and extensions of the classic <b>Spring</b> <b>Mass</b> model are investigated to identify the characteristics that can use the domain specific knowledge o...|$|R
50|$|Excepting {{the case}} of {{vehicles}} with beam axles and vehicles having no suspension, in practice it is normal for inboard brakes to be mounted rigidly {{with respect to the}} body of the vehicle, often to the differential casing. This is done to move the weight of the braking mechanism from being carried by the wheels directly (unsprung weight), to being carried indirectly by the wheels via the suspension (<b>sprung</b> <b>mass).</b> This then necessitates a means of transferring braking torque from the brake mechanism to the wheel, which is capable of operating despite the relative movement between body and wheel. Driven wheels already have shafting (or chains in older vehicles) which serve this purpose so there is no penalty for them, but undriven wheels require a similar mechanism which is then called a brake shaft.|$|E
50|$|Unsprung mass is {{the mass}} of the {{portions}} of bicycles that is not supported by the suspension systems. At one extreme are road bicycles with no suspension in the frames, very little in the tires, and none in the saddles. By raising themselves off their saddles, riders may provide suspension with their knees, making their mass be <b>sprung</b> <b>mass,</b> but all of {{the mass of}} the bicycles remains unsprung mass. At the other extreme are full suspension mountain bikes. With front and rear suspensions the only parts unsuspended are the wheels and small parts of the front forks and rear chain-stays. Even then, as mountain bikes have large low-pressure tires which allow much more travel than small high-pressure road tires, the wheels are sprung to some extent as well.|$|E
50|$|The 7 post shaker places {{forces on}} a vehicle and records {{the forces that}} the vehicle puts back into the system. The 7 post applies lift, downforce, road {{irregularity}} forces and load transfer due to braking, acceleration and cornering. The vehicle suspension and drivetrain components respond to these forces, chassis and suspension frequency oscillations (under 30 Hz), and tire, engine, transmission and drive axle vibrations at higher frequencies. The forces applied are calculated from {{a model of the}} racetrack, the weight of the car and driver, tire pressure, engine RPM, and driveline RPM. The forces that the testing engineers want are placed on the car through the use of four main hydraulic actuators capable of generating 25 kN of force with a maximum velocity in excess of 1 m/s that act on the tires. While the actuators are capable of producing frequencies as high as 500 Hz, this is not necessary as the elasticity of the rubber and air in the tires will absorb most inputs above 50 Hz. The remaining three posts are known as aeroloader actuators, and are responsible for the <b>sprung</b> <b>mass</b> of the vehicle. The forces that these three actuators represent are inertial loads that come from entering a curve or aerodynamic loading and unloading in the form of downforce or lift from a wing. These forces are small on road cars where speeds are not normally greater than 140 km/h, but are significant on a race car where speeds can exceed 300 km/h.|$|E
40|$|Summary. Across a {{broad range}} of size and leg number, legged animals move with {{mechanics}} that resemble a simple <b>spring</b> <b>mass</b> system, consisting of a point mass bouncing forward on a virtual elastic spring leg. For polypeds (> 2 legs) the virtual leg is composed of N/ 2 legs acting in unison. Humans compensate for elastic surfaces by stiffening this virtual elastic leg spring. This has suggested <b>spring</b> <b>mass</b> models as the “control target ” used by legged organisms to run. Here we present comparative work testing the hypothesis that polypeds will use the same strategy of stiffening their virtual leg spring on soft surfaces. Data from insects (six legs) with accelerometer backpacks running on an elastic latex surface, and data from dogs (four legs) show that polypeds do not stiffen their virtual leg on compliant surfaces. We speculate on likely reasons for the difference in control strategy, which include differences in dynamic stability...|$|R
