40|$|Abstract. A signed graph is a graph {{in which}} every edge is {{designated}} to be either positive or negative; it is balanced if every cycle contains an even number of negative edges. A marked signed graph is a signed graph each vertex of which is designated to be positive or negative and it is consistent if every cycle in the signed graph possesses an even number of negative vertices. <b>Signed</b> <b>line</b> graph L(S) of a given signed graph S = (G, σ), as given by Behzad and Chartrand [7], is the signed graph with the standard line graph L(G) of G as its underlying graph and whose edges are assigned the signs according to the rule: for any eiej ∈ E(L(S)), eiej ∈ E − (L(S)) ⇐ ⇒ the edges ei and ej of S are both negative in S. Further, L(S) is S-consistent if to each vertex e of L(S), which is an edge of S, one assigns the sign σ(e) then the resulting marked signed graph (L(S)) µ is consistent.

40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} {{representation}} {{theory of the}} smallest quan-tum group and its categorification. The {{first part of the}} paper contains an easy visualization of the 3 j-symbols in terms of weighted <b>signed</b> <b>line</b> arrangements in a fixed triangle and new binomial expressions for the 3 j-symbols. All these formulas are realized as graded Euler characteris-tics. The 3 j-symbols appear as new generalizations of Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials. A crucial result of the paper is that complete intersection rings can be employed to obtain rational Euler characteristics, hence to categorify ra-tional quantum numbers. This is the main tool for our categorification of the Jones-Wenzl projector, Θ-networks and tetrahedron networks. Net-works and their evaluations {{play an important role in}} the Turaev-Viro construction of 3 -manifold invariants. We categorify these evaluations by Ext-algebras of certain simple Harish-Chandra bimodules. The rel-evance of this construction to categorified colored Jones invariants and invariants of 3 -manifolds will be studied in detail in subsequent papers...|$|E
