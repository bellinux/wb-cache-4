40|$|In the {{framework}} of the FAIR project, the PAX collaboration has proposed a research program based on polarized antiprotons. Polarized antiprotons are to be produced by spin-dependent attenuation on a polarized hydrogen target. For a better understanding of this mechanism it is planned to perform Spin-Filtering studies with protons at COSY (JÃ¼lich). In a second phase, it is envisioned to study Spin-Filtering with antiprotons at the AD (CERN). Which will allow for the determination of the total spin-dependent transverse and longitudinal cross sections. In order to achieve the required long storage times, a storage ring section has to be developed which minimizes the spin-independent losses due to Coulomb scattering.

40|$|Abstract â The main linacs of the {{proposed}} International Linear Collider (ILC) consist of superconducting cavities operated at 2 K. The accelerating cavities are contained in a contiguous series of cryogenic modules that also house the main linac quadrupoles, thus the quadrupoles {{also need to be}} superconducting. In an early ILC design, these magnets are about 0. 6 m long, have cos (2 Î¸) coils, and operate at constant field gradients up to 60 T/m. In order to preserve the small beam emittances in the ILC linacs, the e+ and e- beams need to traverse the quadrupoles near their magnetic centers. A quadrupole shunting technique is used to measure the quadrupole alignment with the beams; this process requires the magnetic centers move by no more than about 5 micrometers when their strength is changed. To determine if such tight stability is achievable in a superconducting quadrupole, we at SLAC measured the magnetic center motions in a prototype ILC quadrupole built at CIEMAT in Spain. A rotating coil technique was used with a better than 0. 1 micrometer precision in the relative field center position, and less than a 2 micrometer systematic error over 30 minutes. This paper describes the warm-bore cryomodule that houses the quadrupole in its Helium vessel, the magnetic center measurement system, the measured center data and strength and harmonics magnetic data.
