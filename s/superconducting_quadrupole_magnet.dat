40|$|In the {{framework}} of the FAIR project, the PAX collaboration has proposed a research program based on polarized antiprotons. Polarized antiprotons are to be produced by spin-dependent attenuation on a polarized hydrogen target. For a better understanding of this mechanism it is planned to perform Spin-Filtering studies with protons at COSY (Jülich). In a second phase, it is envisioned to study Spin-Filtering with antiprotons at the AD (CERN). Which will allow for the determination of the total spin-dependent transverse and longitudinal cross sections. In order to achieve the required long storage times, a storage ring section has to be developed which minimizes the spin-independent losses due to Coulomb scattering. The Coulomb-loss cross section for single scattering losses at fixed energy is proportional to the acceptance angle. Therefore, at the target point the beta functions should be as small as possible.

40|$|Abstract — The main linacs of the {{proposed}} International Linear Collider (ILC) consist of superconducting cavities operated at 2 K. The accelerating cavities are contained in a contiguous series of cryogenic modules that also house the main linac quadrupoles, thus the quadrupoles {{also need to be}} superconducting. In an early ILC design, these magnets are about 0. 6 m long, have cos (2 θ) coils, and operate at constant field gradients up to 60 T/m. In order to preserve the small beam emittances in the ILC linacs, the e+ and e- beams need to traverse the quadrupoles near their magnetic centers. A quadrupole shunting technique is used to measure the quadrupole alignment with the beams; this process requires the magnetic centers move by no more than about 5 micrometers when their strength is changed. To determine if such tight stability is achievable in a superconducting quadrupole, we at SLAC measured the magnetic center motions in a prototype ILC quadrupole built at CIEMAT in Spain. A rotating coil technique was used with a better than 0. 1 micrometer precision in the relative field center position, and less than a 2 micrometer systematic error over 30 minutes. This paper describes the warm-bore cryomodule that houses the quadrupole in its Helium vessel, the magnetic center measurement system, the measured center data and strength and harmonics magnetic data.

The relative orbit offset at the IP and crossing {{angle of the}} two beams are measured by beam-beam deflection scans[1]. Two sets of vertical and horizontal dipole correction magnets in the HER are used for the scans. These magnets are also used to maintain the collision {{as part of a}} feedback system. The luminosity is optimized by continuously correcting for the offset and crossing angle at the IP. The collision feedback system and its performance are discussed in this paper. 1 COLLISION FEEDBACK SYSTEM 1. 1 Feedback parameters The collision feedback system, called `iBump´, consists of 8 dipole correction magnets, 4 for horizontal and 4 for vertical correction. The magnets are located in the straight sections on the left and right side of the IP in the HER. These magnets are dedicated to the iBump feedback system and are used to create bumps at the IP to maintain collision. The feedback system only controls the HER orbit by monitoring the difference orbit between HER and LER. The global orbit feedback is taken care of by another task called `CCC ´ (Continuous COD Correction).
