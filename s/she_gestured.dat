500|$|Lavigne's {{feature film}} debut was voicing an {{animated}} {{character in the}} 2006 film Over the Hedge, based on the comic strip of the same name. She voiced the character Heather, a Virginia opossum. Recording the characters' voices was devoid of interaction with other actors. Lavigne stated, [...] "All the actors went in individually, and [...] Tim and [...] and directors were there with me every time I went in, and they made it go so smoothly; they made me feel comfortable.... That was the interesting part, going in by yourself, with {{no one else to}} kind of feed off of." [...] Lavigne found the recording process to be [...] "easy" [...] and [...] "natural", but she kept hitting the microphone as <b>she</b> <b>gestured</b> while acting. [...] "I'd use my hands constantly and, like, hit the microphone stand and make noises, so Tim and Karey had to tell me to hold still.... It's hard to be running or falling down the stairs and have to make those sounds come out of your mouth but keep your body still." [...] Lavigne believed she was hired to perform Heather because of her rock-star status. [...] " [...] thought I'd give my character... a bit of attitude". The film opened on 19 May 2006, making $38million over its opening weekend. It went on to gross $336million worldwide.|$|E

[...] The owner of the flat, Adrian Lim, approached the inspector and introduced himself, informing [...] Pereira that he was living there with his wife, Tan Mui Choo, and a girlfriend, Hoe Kah Hong. [...] Permitted by Lim to search his flat, the police found traces of blood. [...] Lim initially tried to pass the stains off as candle wax, but when challenged claimed they were chicken blood.

[...] He discreetly removed hair from under a carpet and tried to flush it down the toilet, but the police stopped him; forensics later determined the hair to be Ng's. [...] Requesting a background check on Lim, Pereira received word from local officers that the medium was currently involved in a rape investigation. [...] Lim overheard them and became agitated, raising his voice at the law enforcers. [...] His ire was mimicked by Hoe as <b>she</b> <b>gestured</b> violently and shouted at the officers.

50|$|The {{effects of}} these {{subtleties}} {{can be seen in}} David Blaine's television performances of this illusion. For example, one spectator is asked how high Blaine levitated. <b>She</b> <b>gestures</b> a height that is obviously a few inches higher than the illusion is capable of producing, demonstrating that subtleties can often cause a spectator's interpretation of an effect to be better than the effect itself.|$|R
60|$|His {{mind was}} full of Jeanne, her beauty, her courage, her {{attitude}} in face of the hideous bloodhound {{who had come to}} pollute that charming old-world boudoir by his loathsome presence. He recalled every word <b>she</b> uttered, every <b>gesture</b> <b>she</b> made.|$|R
60|$|At {{the last}} verse <b>she</b> <b>gestured</b> to Carlini the conductor, who threw her up his baton. She caught {{it with a}} boy's ease. 'Are you with me?' she cried once more, and--the maddened house behind her--abolished all the {{instruments}} except the guttural belch of the double-basses on 'Earth'--'The Village that voted the Earth was flat--Earth was flat!' It was delirium. Then {{she picked up the}} Gubby dancers and led them in a clattering improvised lockstep thrice round the stage till her last kick sent her diamond-hiked shoe catherine-wheeling to the electrolier.|$|E

That afternoon, Dallas Police Department detectives arrived at the Paine household, and when asked if Lee owned a rifle, <b>she</b> <b>gestured</b> to the garage, where Oswald stored his rifle rolled up in a blanket; no rifle was found. She was subsequently questioned both at the Paine household and later at Dallas Police Department headquarters in relation to her husband's involvement in the assassination of the President and the shooting of Dallas police officer J.

In Portofino, Italy, while exploring the quaint passageways above town, the director encounters a beautiful woman (Sophie Marceau) and follows her to a seaside clothing shop where the woman works. In the shop, {{she gives him a}} look of recognition. They do not speak, but seem drawn to each other. As the director leaves, <b>she</b> <b>gestures</b> to him but he does not respond.|$|R

30|$|In {{the above}} excerpt, Haile {{was asked to}} make a pattern another way, he responded to this request by {{incorporating}} more shells—nineteen, with the already made pattern, to make a longer pattern. He continued the pattern identifying the repeating elements. Haile was given time to think and engaged in deliberate attempts to solve the task posed drawing on familiar knowledge and placing out nineteen shells. Of significance was that Paula did not interrupt until Haile began to speak. Then, <b>she</b> <b>gestured</b> towards the shells encouraging Haile, who took over and pointed and touched each shell and uttered a corresponding description, “big, smol”.|$|E

50|$|Blind, Deaf, and Dumb: Tanya mouthed {{instructions}} to Chris L. and Paul as <b>she</b> was <b>gesturing,</b> breaking the rules. However, Chris L.'s and Paul's refusal {{to listen to}} Karrie and Tanya as well as Dafydd's yelling, was more suspicious.|$|R
5000|$|Australian {{pop singer}} and Eastern Torres Strait native Christine Anu sang [...] "Taba Naba" [...] on It's a Wiggly Wiggly World, an album by The Wiggles. On the related video <b>she</b> {{performed}} <b>gestures</b> {{that go along}} with the song.|$|R
30|$|Paula {{made the}} {{necessary}} adjustments to her gestures {{based on her}} observations of Haile. He showed how {{he could make a}} repeating pattern out of shells. Here, I refer to Vygotsky (1978) who states that pointing gestures were the first stage in the development of speech and that it is nothing more than an unsuccessful attempt to grasp. Over time a child’s movements “change with the act of pointing becoming a gesture of pointing for others and is understood by others as a gesture” (Ewing 2005, p. 44). Paula was influenced by Haile’s physical movements, gestures and facial expressions, all the while gently prompting and guiding him through the task. Where Haile became unsure, <b>she</b> <b>gestured</b> at the thirteenth shell with him. He then confidently continued to explain the pattern ending with a triumphant grin.|$|E
30|$|Using a fictionalized {{example of}} a study {{examining}} the effect of pain medication on headaches, one slide depicted number of headaches and means for individuals in the treatment group (those taking pain medication), those {{in the placebo group}} (taking a pill that was placebo), and those in the control group (those who took no medication; see Additional file 1). When the speaker said “It’s a measure of how much everybody’s score differs from everybody else,” she gesturally indicated “total variance” by waving her hand around all scores. When she said “The between-groups variance is a measure of how much the each group’s mean differs from the grand mean,” <b>she</b> <b>gestured</b> “between-groups variance” by pointing to the means for each group followed by the grand mean, and when she said “The within-groups variance is a measure of how much a person’s score differs from the mean for their own group,” she pointed to individual scores within a group and then the mean for the group. The lecture was designed to convey a conceptual understanding of ANOVA and did not include any actual mathematical calculations.|$|E

60|$|The {{wonder of}} her grew upon him with every passing moment. How lovely she was!

60|$|With a contemptuous <b>gesture</b> <b>she</b> {{seemed to}} fling unutterable scorn on Almayer's weak-minded aversion to sudden bloodshed.|$|R
50|$|The Allegory of Good Government {{depicts the}} {{personification}} of Justice as a woman. <b>She</b> <b>gestures</b> to the scales of balance, held by {{the personification of}} Wisdom floating over her throne. On the viewer's left, a convicted criminal is beheaded; on the right, figures receive the rewards of justice. At Justice's feet, the personification of Virtue, also, unusually for the time, portrayed as a female figure, passes virtue among twenty four faithfully rendered and recognizable images of prominent male citizens of Siena. The men face towards the largest figure in the image, a judge located in the center right. The judge is surrounded by additional personifications including Peace, who is represented as a fashionable, white-clad contemporary female figure with elaborate blonde hair.|$|R
60|$|Gertrude sat {{very still}} for a few moments, her lips tightly pressed together. Then <b>she</b> made a <b>gesture</b> of weariness.|$|R

60|$|They {{remained}} in silence. With a mute, heavy <b>gesture</b> <b>she</b> {{put her hand}} on his knee, and took his hand.|$|R
5|$|In a {{preliminary}} study for The World Before the Flood {{now in the}} York Art Gallery, the broad structure {{is similar to that}} of the finished work, but the focus is more strongly on the central group of women. In Etty's oil sketch and in preliminary drawings the right-most of the dancing figures, wearing a green skirt, faces outward with her arms behind her back, forming a closed circle together with the central group of dancers. In the finished work, <b>she</b> <b>gestures</b> outwards from the circle, creating a clear narrative flow in the positions of the figures: from the single men on the left, to the man choosing a wife, to the group of dancing women, to the couple leaving the circle of dancers to join the reclining lovers on the far right.|$|R
2500|$|Genie {{gradually}} {{began to}} outwardly exhibit {{more of her}} emotions, and for reasons the scientists never managed to discern she maintained her unexplained ability to communicate her desires to complete strangers without words. Even while speaking she continued to use supplementary nonverbal gestures to improve her intelligibility. Prior to mid-1974 <b>she</b> invented <b>gestures</b> to indicate specific phonemes and homonyms regardless of semantic context, unlike previous observations of invented signing systems in which individual gestures exclusively communicated semantic meaning. Sometimes <b>she</b> used one <b>gesture</b> for two similar-sounding but not completely homophonic words, such as her use of the same gesture for both the words [...] "disappear" [...] and [...] "disappointed".|$|R

30|$|Later on, the {{therapist}} asked MI about her last weekend, and she answered {{that she had}} been to a relative's birthday and ate chocolate cake.

5000|$|In 2000, Golden's [...] "I Should've Never Let You Go" [...] co-written with Faragher, was {{the second}} hit single from the Australian girl group Bardot's #1 debut album, Bardot, {{certified}} 2× Platinum by ARIA, from the Popstars reality TV show. Golden continued working into the early 2000s, but because her recording studio {{was lost in the}} divorce process, she could no longer artistically justify writing songs without creative control. The [...] "Music Connection" [...] interview, appearing over ten years before the partnership break-up, reveals just how important the production aspect of songwriting had become for Golden: [...] "Golden & Faragher's pursuit of songwriting and production seems eons beyond the days of a cluttered Brill Building office with an upright piano. What environment does a songwriter need today? Golden: 'This one.' (<b>She</b> <b>gestures</b> towards the conglomeration of keyboards, computers and recording equipment)." ...|$|R
