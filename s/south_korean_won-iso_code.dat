Over 88,000 <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> soldiers were missing and the Communists' claimed they captured 70,000 <b>South</b> <b>Koreans.</b> However, when ceasefire negotiations began in 1951, the Communists reported they held only 8,000 <b>South</b> <b>Koreans.</b> The UN Command protested the discrepancies and {{alleged that the}} Communists were forcing <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> POWs to join the KPA.|$|R

25|$|North Korea {{continued}} {{to claim that}} any <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> POW who stayed in the North did so voluntarily. However, since 1994, <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> POWs have been escaping North Korea on their own after decades of captivity. As of 2010, the <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> Ministry of Unification reported that 79 ROK POWs escaped the North. The <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> government estimates 500 <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> POWs continue to be detained in North Korea.|$|R
50|$|In addition, <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> {{men over}} the age of 18, {{including}} foreigners of <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> descent, were subject to compulsory military service in the <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> armed forces. From a law that was effective since 2005, a male dual citizen could not be allowed to abandon his <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> citizenship until he finished his military service, or had received a special exemption from military service. In several cases, American men of <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> descent had been drafted into the <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> army upon visiting the country, despite having never been to South Korea before. At least two of the aforementioned cases had involved individuals whose names had, without their knowledge, been recorded in the Hoju, the <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> Family Census Register, which does not automatically remove the names of former <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> citizens.|$|R
50|$|<b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> {{nationality}} law defines {{who is a}} <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> citizen, as well as {{the procedures}} by which one may be naturalized into <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> citizenship or renounce it.|$|R
50|$|The <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> {{nationality}} law {{is based}} on jus sanguinis instead of jus solis, which is a territorial principle {{that takes into account}} the place of birth when bestowing nationality. In this context, most <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> have stronger attachment to <b>South</b> <b>Koreans</b> residing in foreign countries and foreigners of <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> descent, than to naturalized <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> citizens and expatriates residing in South Korea. In 2005, the opposition Grand National Party suggested a revision of the current <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> nationality law to allow <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> nationality to be bestowed to people who are born in South Korea regardless of the nationalities of their parents but it was discarded due to unfavorable public opinion against such a measure.|$|R

5000|$|Additionally, <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> law {{defines the}} term [...] "Overseas Korean" [...] as {{referring}} to <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> nationals who reside overseas {{as well as}} [...] "Koreans with a Foreign Nationality." [...] The latter group is composed of former <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> nationals who gave up their <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> nationality (but barring those who did so to deliberately evade military service, at least until age 36) and children and grandchildren of former <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> nationals. It {{is important to note}} that not every descendant of a <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> can be counted as an [...] "Overseas Korean" [...] or [...] "Korean with a Foreign Nationality" [...] under this law. For example, a 25-year-old man who was born a <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> national overseas but whose birth was unreported will have no documentation to prove his status as a former <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> national, and can only gain status as an Overseas Korean if one of his parents or grandparents gave up <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> nationality. Also, those who fall under Article 7 of the Addenda (Special Cases of Acquisition of Nationality for Persons of Maternal Line By Adoption of Jus Sanguinis to Both Lines of Parents) but failed to acquire <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> nationality are not able to gain the status of an Overseas Korean unless the mother or a maternal grandparent has lost <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> nationality.|$|R
50|$|Tens of {{thousands}} of <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> soldiers were captured by the North Korean and Chinese forces during the Korean War (1950-53) but were not returned during the prisoner exchanges under the 1953 Armistice Agreement. Most are presumed dead, but the <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> government estimates some 560 <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> prisoners of war still survive in North Korea. The issue of unaccounted <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> POWs from the Korean War has been in dispute since the Armistice in 1953. North Korea continues to deny it holds these <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> POWs. Interest in this issue has been renewed since 1994, when Lt. Cho Chang-ho, a former <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> soldier presumed to {{have been killed in}} the war, escaped from North Korea. As of 2008, 79 former <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> soldiers have escaped from North Korea.|$|R
50|$|The <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> National Liberation Front - Preparation Committee {{was created}} by <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> leftists, in order to {{propagate}} socialist and communist ideas to the <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> masses. The eventual goal of the SKNLF-PC was to organize the <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> people and wage a guerrilla war {{similar to that of}} the Viet Cong in South Vietnam, hoping to eventually create a socialist state and reunify with North Korea. The <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> National Liberation Front was dissolved after many members were exposed and arrested by the <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> military regime, including poet Kim Nam-ju. The National Liberation Front Incident is often compared to other instances where the <b>South</b> <b>Korean</b> state exposed (or at least claimed to have exposed) clandestine communist organization, such as the Revolutionary Reunification Party Incident and the People's Revolutionary Party Incident.|$|R
