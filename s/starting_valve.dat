[...] To resolve this, all practical cross compound locomotives have some form of <b>starting</b> <b>valve,</b> which allows admission of HP steam into the LP cylinder on starting.

50|$|A <b>starting</b> <b>valve,</b> {{secured to}} the side of the steam chest over the {{high-pressure}} cylinder, was directly connected to the steam passages of the high-pressure cylinder but, upon starting, permitted boiler steam to pass directly to the low-pressure cylinders as well. A small by-pass valve for the high-pressure cylinder was contained in the casing of the <b>starting</b> <b>valve.</b> The low-pressure cylinders were also provided with by-pass valves.|$|E
50|$|The Von Borries system {{consisted}} of a combined intercepting and <b>starting</b> <b>valve</b> which, when starting, automatically admitted boiler steam into the receiver pipe between the high- and low-pressure cylinders. When the high-pressure cylinder began to exhaust steam into the receiver pipe, the <b>starting</b> <b>valve</b> was automatically closed and normal compound working ensued. A Von Borries compound could not work as simplex at starting because the high-pressure cylinder exhausted into a closed receiver pipe under all conditions. In this respect, the Von Borries system differed essentially from four-cylinder compound systems for locomotives, {{in which the two}} high-pressure cylinders could be made to exhaust to atmosphere by means of a relief valve, operated from the cab by the driver.|$|E

50|$|The Class 310, {{while an}} {{important}} step in Italian locomotive design, was not a thoroughly successful design; the unique cut-off command for both cylinders made it difficult to equalize the work being done, the <b>starting</b> <b>valve</b> design did not prove entirely successful, and the proportions of the cylinders were also less than optimal. The need to obviate these inconvenients {{led to the development of}} the more successful Class 320.|$|E
50|$|A <b>starting</b> <b>valve,</b> {{consisting}} of a Corliss non-throttling rotating valve in combination with a butterfly valve (closed in flight), could divert individual engine output {{to the outside of}} the aircraft, permitting engine starting and ground running with the rotor stationary. Without the valve, back pressure in the duct and rotor system would prevent the starting of the engine. In the P.74 the two Oryx engines fed their outputs to a common duct that took the thrust to the rotor head.|$|E

50|$|Large Diesel {{generators}} {{and almost all}} Diesel engines used as the prime mover of ships use compressed air acting directly on the cylinder head. This is not ideal for smaller Diesels, as it provides too much cooling on starting. Also, the cylinder head needs to have enough space to support an extra valve for the air start system. The air start system is conceptually very similar to a distributor in a car. There is an air distributor that is geared to the camshaft of the Diesel engine; {{on the top of}} the air distributor is a single lobe similar to what is found on a camshaft. Arranged radially around this lobe are roller tip followers for every cylinder. When the lobe of the air distributor hits one of the followers it will send an air signal that acts upon the back of the air <b>start</b> <b>valve</b> located in the cylinder head, causing it to open. Compressed air is provided from a large reservoir that feeds into a header located along the engine. As soon as the air <b>start</b> <b>valve</b> is opened, the compressed air is admitted and the engine will begin turning. It can be used on 2-cycle and 4-cycle engines and on reversing engines. On large 2-stroke engines less than one revolution of the crankshaft is needed for starting.|$|R
5000|$|No [...] "instant on" [...] from a cold <b>start.</b> <b>Valve</b> cathodes need to heat to a glow {{to start}} conducting. In indirect-heating cathodes this could {{take up to}} 20 seconds. Apart from temperature-related instability, this meant that valves would not work {{instantly}} when powered. This led to development of always-on preheating systems for vacuum tube appliances that shortened the wait and may have reduced valve failures from thermal shock, but {{at the price of}} a continuous power drain, and an increased fire hazard. On the other hand, very small, ultra low power direct-heated valves turn on in tenths of a second from a cold start.|$|R
50|$|Air is {{utilized}} {{to start the}} engines. Each cylinder head {{is equipped with a}} <b>start</b> air <b>valve</b> that delivers high-pressure air to the cylinder upon startup. This provides the engine the initial rotation force needed to achieve combustion.|$|R
50|$|The high- and {{low-pressure}} cylinders were {{mounted in}} vertical line with each other, with the piston rods in parallel. Usually the low-pressure cylinder {{was on the}} bottom, but clearance issues sometimes caused it {{to be put on}} the top. In the former case, the valve cylinder was mounted directly inboard from the high-pressure cylinder; in the latter case, the valves were also placed inboard, but at a level between the two power cylinders. The placement of the valves necessitated an inside-connected valve gear, and the Stephenson pattern was used (being the dominant type of the era anyway). One extra appliance required was a <b>starting</b> <b>valve,</b> manually controlled, which allowed admission of high-pressure boiler steam directly to the low-pressure intake. Without this, the low-pressure cylinders would have to actually work against atmospheric pressure.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} predict the behaviour of microbial processes leading {{to the production of}} biogas from animal waste. Mathematical model were developed for the prediction of the behaviour of microbial processes. The development of the models was based upon a material balance analysis of the digester operation, substrate utilization, cell growth and product formation. The model was solved using Runge kutta numerical technique embedded in polymath software. The digesters’ operations simulated with a <b>starting</b> <b>valve</b> of 300 g/dm 3 as the concentration of the substrate and 1. 5 g/dm 3 as the concentration of the cell, within a period of 13 days. The results of the simulation show that the substrate concentration shows exponential decline from (300 g/dm 3 to 6. 88 g/dm 3), the cells growth shows exponential trend from (1. 5 g/dm 3 to 39 g/dm 3) The rate of growth of cell was increased from (0. 5 g/dm 3 - 2. 53 g/dm 3), death increased from (0. 015 g/dm 3 to 0. 161 g/dm 3) over the 13 days and the biogas production which is the product also follow the exponential trend from (zeroconcentration to 219 g/dm 3). In all the model does the prediction well on all the parameters simulated, so it was can be used to predict the product formation rate as well as the design of reactor or digester...|$|E

25|$|The eternal {{problem with}} {{compounds}} is starting: for all cylinders {{to take their}} weight, it is advisable to have some way of short-circuiting the HP cylinders and getting steam at a reduced pressure directly to the LP cylinder(s); hence many of the patented compound systems are associated with particular starting arrangements. The de Glehn 4-cylinder system is probably still the most sophisticated of all with independent HP & LP cut-off and a rotary valve, called a lanterne allowing independent working or combinations of HP and LP groups. Most other systems employ <b>starting</b> <b>valves</b> of various kinds. Another criterion is whether the valve gears {{of the two groups}} are wholly independent or linked together in some way.|$|R

2500|$|Large {{marine diesel}} engines are started using {{compressed}} air, typically between 20 and 30 bar {{and stored in}} two or more large bottles, acting directly on the pistons via special <b>starting</b> <b>valves</b> to turn the crankshaft prior to beginning fuel injection. [...] This arrangement is more compact and cheaper than an electric starter motor would be at such scales, and able to supply the necessary burst of extremely high power without placing a prohibitive load on the ship's electrical generators and distribution system. [...] Compressed air is commonly also used, at lower pressures, to control the engine and act as the spring force acting on the cylinder exhaust valves, and to operate other auxiliary systems and power tools on board, sometimes including pneumatic PID controllers. [...] One advantage {{of this approach is}} that {{in the event of an}} electrical blackout, ship systems powered by stored compressed air can continue functioning uninterrupted, and generators can be restarted without an electrical supply. [...] Another is that pneumatic tools can be used in commonly wet environments without risk of electric shock.|$|R
