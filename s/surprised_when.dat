5|$|Clash {{has stated}} that {{although}} children ignore him and speak directly to Elmo, African-American adults tend to be <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> they meet him. He has stated in interviews that his racial identity was pertinent to his work, and that it came through in his performances.|$|E
5|$|After several failed {{attempts}} to conceive {{a child of}} their own, Monica and Chandler discover that they are both infertile, and ultimately settle upon adoption as an alternative, deciding to adopt the yet-to-be-born child of expectant single mother Erica (Anna Faris). The couple is very much <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> Erica gives birth to twins, and name the boy Jack after Monica's father, and the girl Erica after her birth mother.|$|E
5|$|Ian McDiarmid as Senator Palpatine / Darth Sidious, a Senator of Naboo who is {{eventually}} elected Chancellor of the Republic. McDiarmid was <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> Lucas approached him 16 years after Return of the Jedi to reprise {{the role of}} Palpatine because he had assumed that a younger actor would play the part in the prequel films.|$|E
60|$|But great {{was their}} <b>surprise</b> <b>when</b> Malines, Morris, Jabez, {{and the rest}} of them were landed with their hands bound behind their backs; and still greater was that <b>surprise</b> <b>when,</b> in open court, that is, in the midst of the entire colony in the open air, these men were charged with their crime.|$|R

5|$|When {{designing}} the characters, Nomura had wanted {{at least one}} female character to wear a skirt. Quistis was originally supposed to fill this part, but Nomura decided a long skirt worn over pants would look better. The role was eventually passed to Selphie. Nomura was <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> the writers cast her as a teacher, despite being around {{the same age as}} the rest of the group.|$|E
5|$|Additions {{to the end}} musical number, {{including}} visual gags such as Bob {{appearing in}} uniform, were added after the animatics. The crew felt that watching the character singing would not be interesting enough {{and they had to}} include these gags to make it work. The Simpsons creator Matt Groening was <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> he saw the additions, because he originally thought they were silly and would not appear in the final cut, but he has grown to like them.|$|E
5|$|Arya Stark {{continues}} to train blind with The Waif, but still performs poorly in her duels. After one particular defeat, Arya is <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> Jaqen H'ghar who {{she has not}} encountered for a while, appears and attempts to tempt her with food, bedding, {{and the return of}} her vision. Arya refuses all of Jaqen's offers, and Jaqen tells Arya to follow him, telling her she no longer needs to live as a beggar on the streets.|$|E

5|$|Federation Ambassador Sarek (Mark Lenard) of Vulcan {{has arrived}} {{on board the}} Enterprise with his human wife, Perrin (Joanna Miles). His mission is to attend a conference to lay the {{foundation}} for trade relations between the Federation and an alien race called the Legarans, after which time he will retire due to old age. Though Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and his crew attempt to provide for Sarek and have arranged for a chamber music concert for him, the ambassador expresses apprehension and annoyance. Picard is <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> Sarek starts crying {{in the middle of the}} performance, an emotional trait Vulcans normally suppress.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ruins}} of homeworld of the Daleks, the Doctor is {{approached}} by a woman, who requests his help in freeing her daughter from a Dalek prison. The woman is revealed to be a humanoid “Dalek puppet.” The Doctor is teleported to a spaceship housing the Parliament of the Daleks. Onboard are a now divorced Amy and Rory, who have been similarly kidnapped from present-day Earth. The Doctor is <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> the Daleks ask him for help.|$|E
5|$|Morgan {{had waited}} until her {{academic}} rank was secure before becoming pregnant. She {{had a son}} in 1923, {{the same year that}} she became a full professor. Colleagues were <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> she had the baby, as she had not mentioned being pregnant and she hid the physical evidence of her pregnancy with her long laboratory jacket. Morgan remembered the reaction of one male colleague when she told him the news; he said if she had five children like he did, she would have hardly noticed the new baby. Morgan's mother moved in with her and cared for the baby so that Morgan could work uninterrupted.|$|E

5|$|Sam Black (Gabrielle Anwar) {{replaced}} Julie as {{the head}} of the graphics team in the second series. Sam is very fashion conscious and a flirt, and is <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> an actor rejects her advances in favour of Sarah. Anwar had auditioned for the role of Lynda. (Many actors who unsuccessfully auditioned for main characters were invited back later for guest roles.) Moffat had expanded the role of Julie after the first series, but Lucy Benjamin was unavailable for series two. Sam, therefore, was basically the character of Julie under a different name, especially in her earlier episodes.|$|E
5|$|Sue reveals {{her desire}} to become a mother and asks Will to be the sperm donor. When Will's fiancee, Emma, confronts her about this request, Sue admits that she wants Will's {{capacity}} for kindness for her child. Emma and Will's relationship becomes strained as he focuses on impressing Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) to win tenure, and denigrates her newest set of counseling pamphlets. He is <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> Coach Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) enthusiastically praises Emma for her recent pamphlet on genital sanitation, which has just been adopted by the Big Ten football teams.|$|E
5|$|The 56th Academy Award {{nominations}} {{were announced}} about ten months after Tender Mercies was released. Little {{had been done}} to promote its candidacy: only four Oscar campaign advertisements were purchased; all of them appeared in the trade journal Variety, and Duvall had declined to campaign for himself or the film. Beresford and studio executives were <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> the film was nominated for five Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Harper was believed by some to be a strong contender for either Best Actress or Best Supporting Actress, but ultimately she was nominated in neither category.|$|E

5|$|While the Hummel–Hudson {{wedding is}} being arranged, Sue {{advances}} her own marriage plans. She is <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> her mother arrives in town. Doris (Carol Burnett), a recently retired Nazi hunter {{who was an}} absentee parent to Sue and her sister Jean (Robin Trocki), attempts to make amends for her long absence, but is nevertheless so critical of her daughter that Sue calls her a bully and disinvites her during the wedding rehearsal. Doris leaves, and Sue and Jean comfort each other.|$|E
5|$|A couple, {{referred}} to {{only as the}} Master and Mistress, purchase a pure-bred rough collie named Lad to be the guard dog of their home, the Place. Though they are <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> they receive a puppy instead of an adult dog, they decide to keep him and he quickly shows himself to be very intelligent and easily trainable. At first, Lad views all people as friends, including a burglar who robs the house one night. When the man climbs out the window {{with a bag of}} loot, Lad thinks he is playing a game and snatches the bag in play. The thief chases Lad, then shoots him to get back the bag. Lad realizes the man is not friendly and turns to attack him, but the thief falls into a ditch, knocking himself unconscious. Afterward, Lad no longer trusts strangers so easily and has become a true watchdog.|$|E
5|$|Abi invites Dot to Christmas in Exeter but Dot insists she {{has plans}} of her own. The {{launderette}} closes on Christmas Eve, but everyone is {{too busy to}} visit her. She finds a Christmas mixtape recorded by her now-deceased friend Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), and takes in a stray cat, which she eventually names Dave. She spends Christmas Day alone, but when Patrick realises she has not gone to Exeter, he invites her to The Queen Victoria pub where everyone is celebrating Christmas, and her neighbours present her with the gift of a washing machine. When Ronnie, the wife of Dot's former stepson, Jack Branning (Scott Maslen), and her sister Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons), mother of one of Jack's children, both die, Dot tells the children {{that they are in}} heaven, helping them to understand after Jack struggles to find an appropriate way to tell them. When Jack is unable to take Dot to the garden centre, she decides to drive herself with her great-grandson, Matthew Mitchell Cotton, but drives through a no entry sign into oncoming traffic and ends up in the verge. Dot is <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> Charlie returns {{but it turns out that}} he's only back for his son. Dot's step granddaughter Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) lives with her for a while but moves out with Dot's blessing. Dot is <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> Charlie returns but is left upset when Charlie leaves to go back to Ireland with Mathew, also upsetting Jack. Dot and Jack are unaware this is part of Max Branning's (Jake Wood) evil revenge for his false imprisonment.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{wakes up}} but, {{unable to speak}} much, asks Will to narrate how his life ends. Though struggling, Will tells his father of their {{imagined}} daring escape from the hospital to the nearby lake, where everyone from Edward’s past is there to see him off. Will takes Edward into the river, where he transforms into the giant catfish and swims away. A satisfied Edward dies, knowing Will finally understands his love for storytelling. At the funeral, Will and Joséphine are <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> all the people from Edward’s stories come to the service, though each one is a slightly less fantastical version than described. Will, finally understanding his father’s love for life, passes on Edward’s stories to his own son.|$|E
5|$|However, {{this theory}} allowed a {{compound}} symmetry CP to be conserved. CP combines parity P (switching left to right) with charge conjugation C (switching particles with antiparticles). Physicists were again <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> in 1964, James Cronin and Val Fitch provided clear evidence in kaon decays that CP symmetry could be broken too, winning them the 1980 Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1973, Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa showed that CP violation in the weak interaction required {{more than two}} generations of particles, effectively predicting {{the existence of a}} then unknown third generation. This discovery earned them half of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics. Unlike parity violation, CP violation occurs in {{only a small number of}} instances, but remains widely held as an answer to the difference between the amount of matter and antimatter in the universe; it thus forms one of Andrei Sakharov's three conditions for baryogenesis.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year Things Fall Apart was published, Achebe was {{promoted}} at the NBS and {{put in charge of}} the network's eastern region coverage. He moved to Enugu and began to work on his administrative duties. There he met a woman named Christiana Chinwe (Christie) Okoli, who had grown up in the area and joined the NBS staff when he arrived. They first conversed when she brought to his attention a pay discrepancy; a friend of hers found that, although they had been hired simultaneously, Christie had been rated lower and offered a lower wage. Sent to the hospital for an appendectomy soon after, she was pleasantly <b>surprised</b> <b>when</b> Achebe visited her with gifts and magazines.|$|E

60|$|She {{showed no}} <b>surprise</b> <b>when</b> she met me, but only {{held out her}} hands {{to me as if}} glad to see me.|$|R
60|$|Great {{was their}} <b>surprise</b> <b>when</b> {{they found that}} their comrade Kajo had been brought home as a prisoner; and still greater was their <b>surprise</b> <b>when</b> they found that a bottle of rum which had been stolen from one of their hunters, and carried off the day before, {{was found on the}} person of Kajo--for Kajo had been, like Mangek, a respectable man up to that date, and no one {{believed}} it possible that he would condescend to steal.|$|R
