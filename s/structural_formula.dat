5|$|With a {{molecular}} formula of C3H4Cl2F2O and a condensed <b>structural</b> <b>formula</b> of CHCl2CF2OCH3, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name for methoxyflurane is 2,2-dichloro-1,1-difluoro-1-methoxyethane. It is a halogenated ether {{in form of}} a clear, colorless liquid, and its vapor has a strong fruity aroma. It is miscible with ethanol, acetone, chloroform, diethyl ether, and fixed oils. It is soluble in rubber.|$|E

25|$|The <b>structural</b> <b>formula</b> and {{the bond}} angles {{are not usually}} {{sufficient}} to completely describe the geometry of a molecule. There is a further degree of freedom for each carbon–carbon bond: the torsion angle between the atoms or groups bound to the atoms {{at each end of}} the bond. The spatial arrangement described by the torsion angles of the molecule is known as its conformation.|$|E
50|$|Several {{systematic}} chemical naming formats, as {{in chemical}} databases, are used that are equivalent to, and as powerful as, geometric structures. These chemical nomenclature systems include SMILES, InChI and CML. These systematic chemical names {{can be converted}} to <b>structural</b> <b>formulas</b> and vice versa, but chemists nearly always describe a chemical reaction or synthesis using <b>structural</b> <b>formulas</b> rather than chemical names, because the <b>structural</b> <b>formulas</b> allow the chemist to visualize the molecules and the structural changes that occur in them during chemical reactions.|$|R

25|$|In 1796, German-Russian chemist Johann Tobias Lowitz {{obtained}} pure ethanol {{by mixing}} partially purified ethanol (the alcohol-water azeotrope) with {{an excess of}} anhydrous alkali and then distilling the mixture over low heat. French chemist Antoine Lavoisier described ethanol as a compound of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, and in 1807 Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure determined ethanol's chemical formula. Fifty years later, Archibald Scott Couper published the <b>structural</b> <b>formula</b> of ethanol. It {{was one of the}} first structural formulas determined.|$|E
25|$|The <b>structural</b> <b>formula</b> of {{morphine}} {{was determined by}} 1925 by Robert Robinson. At least three methods of total synthesis {{of morphine}} from starting materials such as coal tar and petroleum distillates have been patented, {{the first of which}} was announced in 1952, by Dr. Marshall D. Gates, Jr. at the University of Rochester. Still, the vast majority of morphine is derived from the opium poppy by either the traditional method of gathering latex from the scored, unripe pods of the poppy, or processes using poppy straw, the dried pods and stems of the plant, the most widespread of which was invented in Hungary in 1925 and announced in 1930 by the chemist János Kabay.|$|E
500|$|At {{the lowest}} point in Julian's career, his former mentor, William Blanchard, threw him a much-needed lifeline. [...] Blanchard offered Julian a {{position}} to teach organic chemistry at DePauw University in 1932. Julian then helped Josef Pikl, a fellow student at the University of Vienna, {{to come to the}} United States to work with him at DePauw. In 1935 Julian and Pikl completed the total synthesis of physostigmine and confirmed the <b>structural</b> <b>formula</b> assigned to it. Robert Robinson of Oxford University in the U.K. had been the first to publish a synthesis of physostigmine, but Julian noticed that the melting point of Robinson's end product was wrong, indicating that he had not created it. When Julian completed his synthesis, the melting point matched the correct one for natural physostigmine from the calabar bean.|$|E

2500|$|Methyl tert-butyl ether (also {{known as}} MTBE and tert-butyl methyl ether) is an organic {{compound}} with a <b>structural</b> <b>formula</b> (CH3)3COCH3. MTBE is a volatile, flammable, and colorless liquid that is sparingly soluble in water. It has a minty odor vaguely reminiscent of diethyl ether, leading to unpleasant taste and odor in water. MTBE is a gasoline additive, {{used as an}} oxygenate to raise the octane number. [...] Its use is controversial because of its contamination of groundwater and legislation favoring ethanol. [...] However, worldwide production of MTBE has been constant owing to growth in Asian markets.|$|E

40|$|Organic {{chemistry}} provides {{fertile ground}} for scholars interested in understanding the role of non-linguistic representations in scientific thinking. In this discipline, it is not plausible to regard diagrams as simply heuristic aids for expressing or applying what is essentially a linguistic theory. Instead, it is more plausible to think of linguistic repre-sentation as supplementing theories whose principal expression is diagrammatic. Among the many sorts of diagrams employed by organic chemists, <b>structural</b> <b>formulas</b> are the most important. In this paper, by examining two central episodes in the devel-opment of structural formulas—Kekulé’s proposal of a structure for benzene and Ingold’s explanation of dipole moments in terms of ‘mesomerism’—I investigate how the norms for the production and interpretation of <b>structural</b> <b>formulas</b> evolve in re-sponse to experimental results and theoretical developments.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Structural</b> <b>formulae</b> {{and other}} crystallochemical p rameters {{were used to}} study {{different}} species of dioctahedral micas in clay and coarse gravel fractions of horizons from a red soil (Ultic Haploxeralf) in southern Spain. Mineralogical nalyses using X-ray powder diffraction, and measurements of the b 0 parameter revealed ioctahedral micas, illite and paragonite. <b>Structural</b> <b>formulae</b> stablished from electron microprobe analysis and energy dispersive X-ray analysis howed the illites to be K mica related in elemental composition and structure to muscovite and phengite. The paragonites {{were found to be}} closer to ideal mica. <b>Structural</b> <b>formulae</b> for Na-K dioctahedral micas were obtained with crystallochemical haracteristics ntermediate b tween those of Na micas and K micas. The possibilty of these micas representing individual mineral phases or intergrowths of Na and K micas is discussed, In the soil profile, micas from the Bt horizon showed the largest crystallochemical hanges induced by pedogenesis. Micaceous phyllosilicates are frequent in soils; the US Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 1975, 1994) distinguishes the micaceous, illitic and glauconitic soil families.
