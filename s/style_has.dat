5|$|An {{outline of}} the origins of the {{parasitic}} life <b>style</b> <b>has</b> been proposed. Epithelial feeding monopisthocotyleans on fish hosts are basal in the Neodermata and were the first shift to parasitism from free living ancestors. The next evolutionary step was a dietary change from epithelium to blood. The last common ancestor of Digenea + Cestoda was monogenean and most likely sanguinivorous.|$|E

5|$|A {{particularly}} rare feature {{found on}} Motul de San Jos√© ceramics {{is the so-called}} X-ray style, showing a figure wearing a mask but also portraying his face underneath it. All the other representations using this rare style are depicted on Late Classic sculptures at sites with which {{it is known that}} Motul de San Jos√© had contact at this time, including Dos Pilas, Machaquila, Tikal and Yaxchilan.

5|$|Asser's prose <b>style</b> <b>has</b> been criticised for weak syntax, stylistic pretensions, and garbled exposition. His {{frequent}} use of archaic and unusual words gives his prose a baroque flavour that is common in Insular Latin authors of the period. He uses several words that are peculiar to Frankish Latin sources. This has led to speculation that he was educated at least partly in Francia, {{but it is also}} possible that he acquired this vocabulary from Frankish scholars he associated with at court, such as Grimbald.|$|E

5|$|Fat Freddy's Drop is a New Zealand seven-piece {{band from}} Wellington, whose musical <b>style</b> <b>has</b> been characterised as any {{combination}} of dub, reggae, soul, jazz, rhythm and blues, and techno. Originally a jam band formed in the late 1990s by musicians from other bands in Wellington, Fat Freddy's Drop gradually became its members' sole focus. Band members continued playing with their other respective groups‚ÄîThe Black Seeds, TrinityRoots, Bongmaster, and others‚Äîfor much of their 13-year career. Fat Freddy's Drop {{are known for their}} improvised live performances; songs on their studio albums are versions refined over years of playing them live in New Zealand, and on tour abroad.|$|E
5|$|His vocal <b>style</b> <b>has</b> {{varied from}} a screaming, yowling {{delivery}} as lead vocalist of the Pixies {{to a more}} measured and melodic style in his solo career. His cryptic lyrics mostly explore unconventional subjects, such as surrealism, incest and biblical violence, along with science fiction and surf culture. His use of atypical meter signatures, loud‚Äìquiet dynamics and distinct preference for live-to-two-track recording in {{his career as a}} solo artist give him a distinct style within alternative rock.|$|E

5|$|Members of Howling Bells {{have cited}} The Beatles, Charles Mingus, Peter Green, Vinnie Colaiuta, and Jimi Hendrix as influences. The {{catalyst}} for the change from Waikiki to Howling Bells was Juanita and Joel's trip to see Black Rebel Motorcycle Club in Australia. They saw this band shrouded in red lights, and it created an atmosphere that inspired them to alter their musical direction. The band's <b>style</b> <b>has</b> been {{compared to that of}} Siouxsie and the Banshees, PJ Harvey, The Velvet Underground, Nick Cave, Mazzy Star, and The Duke Spirit. Their music has been called folk rock, melodic blues, and country-goth. Juanita disagrees with the group's gothic characterization.|$|E
5|$|Route {{branding}} {{has been}} increasingly used by Lothian since {{the introduction of}} low floor vehicles. Route branding highlights the route of certain services making the buses easier to be spotted throughout Lothian. Since May 2010 the Harlequin livery used to identify low floor buses has started to be phased out, as the company is now a full low floor operation, with {{a return to the}} traditional madder and white livery although the <b>style</b> <b>has</b> been altered slightly to suit the lines of modern buses. Each type of bus owned directly by Lothian Buses has had at least one of their type painted in the new livery.|$|E
5|$|The cursive <b>style</b> <b>has</b> many unorthodox {{characteristics}} {{uncommon to}} Western writing systems. Vowels can be dropped if {{the writer is}} in a hurry and feels the word is obvious as in an abjad, letters can be written above or below the base line depending on what precedes them, and êêÆ is placed on letters after they are already written as in an abugida. Furthermore, unlike the typeset alphabet, the cursive alphabet has no letter case. These characteristics could have arisen because Watt was a local expert in Pitman shorthand, which is written in a similar way.|$|E

5|$|The {{distinctness}} of the Donegal tradition developed due to {{the close}} relations between Donegal and Scotland, and the Donegal repertoire and <b>style</b> <b>has</b> influences from Scottish fiddle music. For example, {{in addition to the}} standard tune types such as Jigs and Reels, the Donegal tradition also has Highlands (influenced by the Scottish Strathspey). The distinctiveness of the Donegal tradition led to some conflict between Donegal players and representatives of the mainstream tradition when Irish traditional music was organised in the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|When feeding, this flycatcher makes many short {{flights from}} perch to perch, preferring to hunt in shrubs with small leaves, {{particularly}} {{those from the}} genera Adesmia, Baccharis, and Porlieria. A tit-tyrant tends to land near {{the base of the}} shrub and make its way upwards while frequently flicking its tail upwards and shuddering its wings. It has also been observed pivoting on its perch throughout this process. While foraging, the tufted tit-tyrant averages three attacks on prey items per minute. Its feeding <b>style</b> <b>has</b> been compared to that of a kinglet.|$|E
5|$|Whereas the eponymous concept album's lyrics {{focus on}} human {{struggle}} and self-determination, A Beautiful Lies lyrics are more personal {{and the music}} introduces screaming vocals.

The album widened the band's sound by combining elements from progressive rock, hard rock and emo. Such alternative rock <b>style</b> <b>has</b> been compared to bands like The Cure, U2 and The Smashing Pumpkins.|$|E
