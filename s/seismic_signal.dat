2500|$|The first {{explosion}} at Greenside involved the detonation of [...] of TNT {{placed on a}} wooden frame in the centre of an ellipsoidal chamber [...] long and [...] in diameter. This was the decoupled charge. It was detonated at 22:30 on 19December 1959, and the seismic signals were detected at six locations up to [...] away. The second explosion, of [...] of TNT packed into a small chamber [...] long and [...] in diameter, should have followed 30minutes later. This was the smaller, coupled charge, in order to compare its seismic effects with the larger decoupled one. However the first explosion destroyed the cables and control equipment needed to detonate the second charge. The second test was further delayed by a mining accident, and eventually took place at 19:00 on 29April 1960. But the tests were conclusive. The smaller charge {{gave rise to a}} larger <b>seismic</b> <b>signal</b> and showed that the effect of the decoupled charge was attenuated by a factor of between 10 and 30.|$|E

An essential discrimination task is to allocate the incoming signal to a group associated with the kind of physical phenomena producing it. In this paper, we present new techniques for <b>seismic</b> <b>signals</b> classification: local, regional and global discrimination. These techniques were tested on <b>seismic</b> <b>signals</b> from the data base of the National Geophysical Institute of the Centre National pour la Recherche Scientifique et Technique (Morocco) by using the Moroccan software for <b>seismic</b> <b>signals</b> analysis.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Seismic</b> <b>signals</b> {{generated}} by artificially released avalanches were studied f’rom the seismological viewpoint {{in the time}} and frequency domains {{in an attempt to}} characterise them for monitoring purposes. The avalanches were artificially released and the corresponding <b>seismic</b> <b>signals</b> were recorded at different sites within a radius of up to 3 km together with the video images with a common time reference. The results obtained indicate that avalanches following the same path and recorded at the same site present similar <b>seismic</b> <b>signals.</b> A relationship between the avalanche <b>seismic</b> <b>signals</b> (amplitude, frequency content and wave trains) and the avalanche path was observed. The sources of the recorded <b>seismic</b> <b>signals</b> corresponds to avalanche path slope changes, interaction with obstacles and phenomena associated with the stopping stage of the avalanche. Local site effects were also present. These results lend support to the use of <b>seismic</b> <b>signals</b> as an efficient method of monitoring areas where avalanches are frequent and human observation is difficult...|$|R

Kurtosis has also been used to distinguish the <b>seismic</b> <b>signal</b> generated by a person's footsteps from other signals. As persons or other targets moving on the ground generate continuous signals in the form of seismic waves, one can separate different targets based on the seismic waves they generate. Kurtosis is sensitive to impulsive signals, so it's much more sensitive to the signal generated by human footsteps than other signals generated by vehicles, winds, noise, etc. [...] Unfortunately, the notation for kurtosis has not been standardized. Kenney and Keeping [...] use the symbol γ2 for the excess kurtosis, but Abramowitz and Stegun [...] use different terminology.

Here we explore the evolution of complex courtship signaling {{by taking advantage of}} a system in which sexual selection on male courtship traits has driven the diversification of geographically isolated populations of the jumping spider Habronattus pugillis Griswold. Using 2 populations (Santa Rita [SR] and Atascosa [AT]) in which SR females show xenophilic mating preferences for foreign (AT) over local males (SR), we examine the mechanisms driving this preference. Both AT and SR males produce multimodal <b>signals</b> (visual + <b>seismic),</b> and while SR and AT <b>signals</b> share certain <b>seismic</b> components, AT <b>seismic</b> <b>signals</b> are more complex and contain novel components.
