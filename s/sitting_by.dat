5|$|Dürer's {{well-known}} engraving Melencolia I {{depicts a}} frustrated thinker <b>sitting</b> <b>by</b> a truncated triangular trapezohedron and a magic square. These two objects, and the engraving as a whole, {{have been the}} subject of more modern interpretation than the contents of almost any other print, including a two-volume book by Peter-Klaus Schuster, and an influential discussion in Erwin Panofsky's monograph of Dürer.|$|E
5|$|On remand, Judge Stone denied Kretske {{probation}} {{and set his}} sentence to begin on April 10, 1942. Judge Sullivan dismissed a different indictment against Kretske on April 9. Judge F. Ryan Duffy, of the Eastern District of Wisconsin, <b>sitting</b> <b>by</b> designation, denied a government motion to dismiss Kretske's habeas petition on April 14 and set a hearing for the following day. Judge Duffy denied Kretske bail and denied the petition of April 15.|$|E
5|$|The {{children}} {{spent the}} morning in the resort's Kids' Club, then the family lunched at their apartment before heading to the pool. Kate took the last known photograph of Madeleine at 2:29 that afternoon, <b>sitting</b> <b>by</b> the pool next to her father and two-year-old sister. The children returned to Kids' Club, and at 18:00 their mother took them back to 5A, while their father went for a tennis lesson. The McCanns put the children to bed around 19:00. Madeleine was left asleep in short-sleeved, pink-and-white Marks and Spencer's Eeyore pyjamas, next to her comfort blanket and a soft toy, Cuddle Cat.|$|E

5|$|Twenty years later, Jane, now a {{successful}} author and by choice unmarried, sees Tom during a gathering. Henry, now married to Eliza, brings Tom to her. Tom introduces his eldest daughter, who admires Jane's novels. Tom's daughter asks Jane to read aloud, but as Jane rarely does so he remonstrates {{with his daughter}} using her name, which is also Jane. Astonished that he named his eldest after her, Jane agrees to read. The last scene shows Tom's daughter <b>sitting</b> <b>by</b> Jane as she reads aloud from Pride and Prejudice, while Tom watches Jane affectionately. As she concludes, their eyes meet, and Tom joins {{the rest of the}} company in honouring Jane and her work with applause.|$|E
5|$|Burton was reindicted, {{still in}} the circuit court Eastern District of Missouri, on April 13, 1905, and arraigned on June 4 before Judge John Henry Rogers, of the Western District of Arkansas, <b>sitting</b> <b>by</b> designation. The new {{indictment}} had eight counts. The first, second, fourth, sixth, and eighth counts charged that Burton had agreed to receive compensation from Rialto. The third, fifth, and seventh counts charged that Burton had actually received compensation from Rialto. The counts different only {{in the interest of}} the United States which was alleged to have been involved in the matter. Counts four and five were dismissed before trial. Unlike the first indictment, the second alleged that Burton had received $500 in person in St. Louis. The first indictment alleged only compensated representation, the second indictment also alleged an agreement to do so.|$|E
5|$|In chapter 3, King Völsung {{is holding}} a {{marriage}} feast for his daughter Signy and King Siggeir at King Völsung's hall. At the hall, large fires are kindled in long hearths running {{the length of the}} hall, while {{in the middle of the}} hall stands the great tree Barnstokkr. That evening, while those attending the feast are <b>sitting</b> <b>by</b> the flaming hearths, they are visited by a one-eyed, very tall man whom they do not recognize. The stranger is wearing a hooded, mottled cape, linen breeches tied around his legs, and is barefooted. Sword in hand, the man walks towards Barnstokkr and his hood hangs low over his head, gray with age. The man brandishes the sword and thrusts it into the trunk of the tree, and the blade sinks to its hilt. Words of welcome fail the crowd.|$|E
50|$|The pain is {{typically}} caused <b>by</b> <b>sitting,</b> relieved <b>by</b> standing, and is absent when recumbent (lying down) or {{sitting on a}} toilet seat. If the perineal pain is positional (changes with the patient's position, for example sitting or standing), this suggests a tunnel syndrome. Anesthesiologist John S. McDonald of UCLA reports that <b>sitting</b> pain relieved <b>by</b> standing or <b>sitting</b> on a toilet seat is the most reliable diagnostic parameter.|$|R

5|$|Laura Knight {{spent the}} summer of 1908 working on the beaches at Newlyn making studies for her large {{painting}} of children in bright sunlight. The Beach was shown at the Royal Academy in 1909, and was considered a great success, showing Laura painting in a more Impressionist style than she had displayed previously. About this time she began painting compositions {{of women in the}} open air, in the plein-air manner, often on the rocks or cliff-tops around Lamorna. Knight would sometimes use models from London who were prepared to pose nude. Although there was some resentment locally about this, the landowner, a Colonel Paynter, was fully supportive and allowed Knight and the other artists a free rein. Daughters of the Sun, which showed several women, some naked, <b>sitting</b> <b>by</b> a coastal inlet was completed in 1911 and well received when shown at the Royal Academy, but was subsequently damaged and destroyed. In recent years examples of Knight's plein-air compositions from Cornwall have attracted high prices at auction.|$|E
5|$|Having {{heard all}} of that, the brother took two pistols, poured more gunpowder, and {{sharpened}} the flints; {{he put the}} pistols into his belt, placed the knife between them, and slung a musket over his shoulder. He set forth. He passed through the dark forest; he came beneath the stair-like cliff; {{the moon and the}} stars were shining, so it was like a day; a silence all around him, pleasant; he sat down and lit his pipe. Before long a wisp of cloud showed from the direction of Mount Rumija; there came a roar and bluster, and everything happened as the sick man said. His hair rose so that three times he jammed his cap down on his head. Finally, three bulls fell down from the storm cloud and started to fight; all as it was said. He stabbed the pied bull in the neck with the knife; it staggered and fell; the light-haired bull got encouraged. Then he stabbed the dark-haired bull, and it slumped; the light-haired was finishing them off with its horns. This was not enough for him, and, fearing that the cut bulls could still rise up, he kept on striking them with the knife as long as there was a breath in their bodies. The storm cloud suddenly disappeared; together with it, the light-haired bull vanished. Again the moon and the stars shone; again a silence and blessedness. He was going back home as if flying; when he arrived he found his brother <b>sitting</b> <b>by</b> the hearth, placing logs on the fire, healthy as if he had never been sick.|$|E
5|$|Inspiration for {{the book}} came from a Douglas-fir tree with a curve in its trunk. While <b>sitting</b> <b>by</b> the tree, at his home on Quadra Island, near Vancouver, David Suzuki {{realized}} that even though his family had played on it for years, {{he did not know}} how old it was or how its uncharacteristic curve had developed. Suzuki, a science writer and broadcaster, and former zoologist, speculated that the soil might have slid when the tree was young or that another plant might have blocked the sunlight. He thought that the tree must have endured much hardship throughout its life and made a connection between biographies of people and the story of this tree's life. It also reminded him of an idea he had for a children's book about interconnectivity of life, especially within plants. Along with a research assistant, he studied the topic. Suzuki started to write a draft but a busy schedule interfered so he sought a collaborator. Science writer and former Harrowsmith editor Wayne Grady agreed to participate. Suzuki provided the research, framework, and some original writing and Grady did most of the writing. Together, Grady in Ontario and Suzuki in Vancouver, went through five drafts. Wildlife artist Robert Bateman was brought into the project through social connections between the wives of Bateman and Suzuki. In creating the book, their intention was to illustrate the complexity and interconnectivity of this ecosystem by focusing on one tree's role over time.|$|E

5|$|Loxton {{entered the}} Victorian {{parliament}} in 1955, {{and served as}} government whip from 1961 {{until his retirement in}} 1979. At the time of his election, he was the youngest member of parliament, and was given the honour of making the Address-in-Reply, the first speech after opening of the new <b>sitting</b> <b>by</b> the governor, using it to advocate increased lending from the government-owned banks to promote higher levels of home ownership. At the 1958 election, Loxton consolidated his hold on the seat, leading on first preferences (43.67%), and ending with 54.85% of the two party preferred vote to halt Pettiona's attempted comeback. During the election campaign in 1961, a campaign meeting in Prahran that was attended by Premier Bolte and Loxton drew several hundred people and descended into chaos; heckling and some scuffles broke out. At this election, the Liberals' primary vote fell to 41.69% behind the Labor Party's candidate George Gahan 45.29%, and he had to rely on DLP preferences to retain the seat with a reduced two party preferred vote of 52.71%. The Liberals may have been hindered by a how-to-vote card circulated on election day by a third party that had a pro-Liberal headline, but instructed the reader to mark the ALP candidate as their first preference. Loxton managed to secure a court injunction—believed to be {{the first of its kind}} in Victoria—prohibiting further distribution of the material, but not before hundreds of misleading instructions had been disseminated.|$|E
5|$|Many USGS {{scientists}} {{worked on}} the team monitoring the volcano, but it was graduate student Harry Glicken who had been manning the ColdwaterII observation post for the {{two and a half}} weeks immediately preceding the eruption. The evening before the eruption he was scheduled to be relieved by USGS geologist Don Swanson in order to visit the graduate school at the University of California. Swanson, however, wanted to meet with a German graduate student who was returning to Germany on May 18. Two days before the eruption, Swanson ran into Johnston in the hallway and asked him to take his place. Johnston hesitantly agreed to man the base for one day. That Saturday, the day before the eruption took place, Johnston ascended the mountain and went on a patrol of the volcano with geologist Carolyn Driedger. Tremors shook the mountain. Driedger was supposed to camp on one of the ridges overlooking the volcano that night, but Johnston told her to head home and said that he would stay on the volcano alone. While at ColdwaterII, Johnston was to observe the volcano for any further signs of an eruption. Just prior to his departure, at 7p.m. on the evening of May 17, 13½ hours before the eruption, Glicken took the famous photograph of Johnston <b>sitting</b> <b>by</b> the observation post trailer with a notebook on his lap, smiling.|$|E
25|$|The panel divided. Myron L. Gordon, a Wisconsin {{district}} judge <b>sitting</b> <b>by</b> designation, distinguished Wilko from The Bremen {{by noting that}} the latter case did not involve a transfer of securities. Scherk also had sufficient contacts in the United States to give the court jurisdiction. Gordon therefore held for himself and Indiana {{district judge}} Robert A.

25|$|Hon. Cynthia D. Kinser, former Justice (Chief Justice 2011-2014). Because Chief Justice Kinser {{returned}} {{to the practice of}} law after she retired from the court, she is not currently subject to recall for service on the Court because of the ethical conflict this would create between her practice of the law and her role as a justice. Moreover, justices serving in senior status or <b>sitting</b> <b>by</b> designation must be receiving benefits from the Virginia Retirement System, and under the rules applying to judges and justices, receipt of retirement benefits precludes the judge or justice from engaging in the private practice of law.|$|E

The final victim was 46-year-old father of two and youth sports coach Steven Forsyth, who was <b>sitting</b> <b>by</b> a rented kiosk and talking with his father on his cell phone when he {{was shot in the head}} and killed.|$|E
25|$|However, the Meditator {{realizes that}} he is often {{convinced}} when he is dreaming that he is sensing real objects. He feels certain that he is awake and <b>sitting</b> <b>by</b> the fire, but reflects that often he has dreamed this very sort of thing and been wholly convinced by it. Though his present sensations may be dream images, he suggests that even dream images are drawn from waking experience, much like paintings in that respect. Even when a painter creates an imaginary creature, like a mermaid, the composite parts are drawn from real things—women and fish, {{in the case of}} a mermaid. And even when a painter creates something entirely new, at least the colors in the painting are drawn from real experience. Thus, the Meditator concludes, though he can doubt composite things, he cannot doubt the simple and universal parts from which they are constructed like shape, quantity, size, time, etc. While we can doubt studies based on composite things, like medicine, astronomy, or physics, he concludes that we cannot doubt studies based on simple things, like arithmetic and geometry.|$|E
