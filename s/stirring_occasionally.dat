60|$|Whenever we {{awoke in}} the night, still eking out our dreams with half-awakened thoughts, {{it was not}} till after an interval, when the wind breathed harder than usual, {{flapping}} the curtains of the tent, and causing its cords to vibrate, that we remembered that we lay {{on the bank of}} the Merrimack, and not in our chamber at home. With our heads so low in the grass, we heard the river whirling and sucking, and lapsing downward, kissing the shore as it went, sometimes rippling louder than usual, and again its mighty current making only a slight limpid, trickling sound, as if our water-pail had sprung a leak, and the water were flowing into the grass by our side. The wind, rustling the oaks and hazels, impressed us like a wakeful and inconsiderate person up at midnight, moving about, and putting things to rights, <b>occasionally</b> <b>stirring</b> up whole drawers full of leaves at a puff. There seemed to be a great haste and preparation throughout Nature, as for a distinguished visitor; all her aisles had to be swept in the night, by a thousand hand-maidens, and a thousand pots to be boiled for the next day's feasting;--such a whispering bustle, as if ten thousand fairies made their fingers fly, silently sewing at the new carpet with which the earth was to be clothed, and the new drapery which was to adorn the trees. And then the wind would lull and die away, and we like it fell asleep again.|$|R
40|$|The {{very first}} {{criterion}} {{is that a}} good editorial is an opinion maker. If it is based on evidence, so much the better. But it analyses evidence rather than produces it. Of course what it analyses can be the basis of the production of new evidence. But it is more like the 'Results and Discussion' that follow 'Materials and Method' in a research paper in so far as it is an objective analysis. However, it goes beyond an analysis. It must necessarily also express an opinion. It must attempt to critically analyse and sift from the various opinions, analyses and evidences floating around. It must present a refreshing perspective on an issue so as to retain balance when writings get opinionated; and/or stir up the crotchety and crusty when scientific/creative stupor sets in. Moreover, a good editorial is contemporary without being populist. It tackles recent events and issues, and attempts to formulate viewpoints based on an objective analysis of happenings and conflicting/contrary opinions. An editorial is predominantly about balance. But that does not prevent it from <b>occasionally</b> <b>stirring</b> things up, when such is the need. Hence a hard-hitting editorial is as legitimate as a balanced equipoise that reconciles apparently conflicting positions and controversial posturings, whether amongst politicians (in news papers), or amongst researchers (in academic journals). All said and done, the element of balance can never be lost. For that, it certainly helps if an editor is a balanced individual by temperament as well. However, let it not mean that balance in temperament excludes crusading zeal. Most editors of some merit have the latter in reasonable quantity, although they may play it down, or publicly make a mockery of it, since it is the in thing to do (the mockery, not the crusading). Moreover, denial can be a strong defense mechanism, as much in editors as in the rest of humanity. [No abstract available. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{soils and}} biochar samples were ground to < 2  mm for all {{chemical}} analysis but for Brunauer-Emmet-Teller (BET) specific surface area. For total element, C, N, NH 4 NO 3 extractable trace elements and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analyses, samples were milled with a planetary ball mill {{to achieve a}} homogeneous fine powder (Fritsch GmbH, Idar-Oberstein, Germany). Similarly, the completely dried lettuce (oven drying at 65  °C for at least 72  h) was ground, ball-milled to achieve a homogeneous fine powder. The pH of biochar in water was determined in 1 : 20 (w/v) ratio after <b>occasionally</b> <b>stirring</b> over an hour (Cheng et al. 2006). The pH of the soils in water suspensions were determined in 1 : 2.5 (w/v) ratio after shaking over 2  h. The EC of the biochar was determined after an hour equilibration of 1  g of biochar with 20  ml of distilled water. The EC of the soil samples were determined after 2  h equilibration of 1  g of soil with 2.5  ml of distilled water. For total element analysis, 0.25  g samples of biochar and plant were placed into 50  ml vessels, followed by addition of 10  ml concentrated HNO 3. The mixtures were left over night and then heated in 1.6 kilowatts microwave oven for 30  min. After cooling to room temperature, 10  ml of double distilled water were added into the vessels and filtered via 0.45  µm cellulose nitrate filter papers. Finally, the filtrates were subjected to the total element analysis using ICP-OES (Ciros CCD, SPECTRO Analytical Instruments GmbH, Kleve, Germany). Olsen-P (available P) was extracted by placing 1  g sample of soil in 20  ml of NaHCO 3 for 30  min. Similar amount of biochar samples were placed in 20  ml of NaHCO 3 for 30  min. The suspensions were vacuum filtered via 0.45  µm cellulose nitrate filter papers and analyzed using ICP-OES (Ciros CCD, SPECTRO Analytical Instruments GmbH, Kleve, Germany). For C and N analyses, 3.5  mg for biochar, 5  mg for plant and 40  mg for soil, samples were weighted into sample boats and determined using C and N analyzer (Elementar Analyse GmbH, Hanau, Germany). The exchangeable cations and CEC of biochar were determined using BaCl 2 method. The exchangeable cations and CEC of soils were determined using NH 4 Cl method. NH 4 NO 3 (1  M) extractable fractions of trace nutrients and toxic elements were also determined following the extraction procedure proposed by the German national standard (DIN ISO 10730 2009).|$|R

The EC of the soil was determined after 2  h equilibration of 1  g of soil with 2.5  ml of distilled water. Soil Particle size distributions were determined by laser diffraction using an Analysette 22 MicroTec plus (Fritsch GmbH, Idar-Oberstein, Germany) with a wet dispersion unit. For total element analysis, 0.25  g of biochar and soil were placed into 50  ml vessels, followed by addition of 10  ml concentrated HNO 3. The mixtures were left to cold digest in a fume cupboard over night and then heated in 1.6 KW microwave oven for 30  min. After cooling to room temperature, 10  ml of double distilled water was added into the vessel and filtered via a 0.45  µm cellulose nitrate filter paper. Finally, the filtrate was subjected to the total element analysis using ICP-OES (Ciros CCD, SPECTRO Analytical Instruments GmbH, Kleve, Germany).

The suspension was vacuum filtered via a 0.45  µm cellulose nitrate filter paper and analyzed using ICP-OES (Ciros CCD, SPECTRO Analytical Instruments GmbH, Kleve, Germany). For C and N analyses, about 3.5  mg of biochar and 40  mg of soil were weighted into sample boats and determined using C and N analyzer (Elementar Analyse GmbH, Hanau, Germany). Acetanilide was used as calibration standard. Total surface acidity was determined by adding 0.15 gm of biochar into 15  ml of 0.1  N NaOH and shaken for 30  h. The suspension was vacuum filtered and 5  ml of 0.1  N NaOH aliquot was transferred to 10  ml of 0.1  N HCl to completely neutralize the unreacted base. The solution was back-titrated with 0.1  N NaOH using a Metrohm 725 Dosimat (Metrohm AG, Herisau, Switzerland) fitted with a 691 pH meter (Metrohm AG, Herisau, Switzerland). Similarly, the surface basicity was measured by shaking 0.15  g of biochar with 15  ml of 0.1  N HCl for 30  h. The slurry was vacuum filtrated (0.45  µm) and an aliquot of 5  ml of 0.1  N HCl was mixed with 10  ml of 0.1  N NaOH to neutralize the unreacted acid. The solution was back-titrated with 0.1  N HCl. The total surface acidity and basicity were determined by calculating the base and acid uptake of biochars (Goertzen et al. 2010). For dissolved organic carbon (DOC) determination, extract was prepared by shaking biochar with 0.01  M CaCl 2 at 1 : 25 ration (w/v) for 1  h. The suspension was vacuum filtered and measured by a Dimatoc 2000 (DIMATEC Analysentechnik GmbH, Essen, Germany). The exchangeable cations and CEC of biochar were determined using BaCl 2 method. Briefly, 2.5 gm of biochar was weighted into 50  ml centrifuge tube, followed by addition of 30  ml of 0.1  M BaCl 2. The tube was shaken for 1  h and then centrifuged at 5500  rpm for 10  min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was decanted into a 100  ml volumetric flask. This procedure was repeated three times. The collected supernatants were made up to 100  ml with 0.1  M BaCl 2 solution. The Na, Mg, Ca, K and Al concentrations of the solution were determined using ICP-OES (Ciros CCD, SPECTRO Analytical Instruments GmbH, Kleve, Germany). The same procedure was followed to determine the water soluble Na, Mg, Ca, K and Al concentrations of biochar. Finally, the concentration of exchangeable cations and CEC of biochar was computed by subtracting the concentration of water soluble cations (Na, Mg, Ca and K) to the concentration of cations extracted by 0.1  M BaCl 2. For FTIR analyses of biochars, pellets were prepared by mixing biochars with KBr powder and then analyzed using a Tensor 27 FTIR Spectrometer (Bruker optik GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany). Spectra were collected {{in the range of}} 400 – 4000  cm− 1 at 4  cm− 1 and 120 scans per sample. Surface areas of the biochars were determined using adsorption data of the adsorption isotherms of N 2 at − 196  °C and calculated by the Brunauer–Emmet–Teller (BET) equation (Brunauer et al. 1938). For biochar and post harvest soil samples, NH 4 NO 3 (1  M) extractable fraction of Cd was determined following the extraction procedure proposed by the German national standard (DIN 19730 2009). A milled plant sample was analyzed for total Cd, P, K, Ca, Mg and Zn concentrations as previously described.|$|R
