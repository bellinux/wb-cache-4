The main purpose of this section is to provide an example case for producing distortion measurements using the DATK, rather than to perform a detailed interpretation of the operation of the devices. Thus, the emphasis is on explaining the measurement procedure, and what is the useful information in the analysis results, without trying to explain why the amplifier or its virtual versions have a certain effect on the signal.|$|R

40|$|With the {{increased}} popularity of concession projects {{over the last}} three decades, {{there is a need for}} a decision support system (DSS) capable of evaluating and comparing several concession project investment (CPI) options in an effective and efficient manner. Hence, a novel DSS has been developed that takes into consideration both financial and nonfinancial aspects of the investment option, as well as the uncertainties commonly encountered during the feasibility stage of a project. The DSS is fully implemented as a <b>standalone</b> computer <b>software</b> package, ECCO (evaluate and compare concession options), in order to be of practical use.
