40|$|Fluid-elastic {{instability}} of loosely <b>supported</b> <b>tubes,</b> vibrating in a tube-support-plate (TSP) inactive mode, is suspected {{to be one}} of the main causes of tube failure in some operating steam generators and heat exchangers. This report presents a mathematical model for fluid-elastic {{instability of}} loosely <b>supported</b> <b>tubes</b> exposed to non-uniform cross-flow. The model incorporates all motion-dependent fluid forces based on the unsteady flow theory. In the unstable region associated with a TSP-inactive mode, tube motion can be described by two linear models: TSP-inactive mode when tubes do not strike the TSP, and TSP-active mode when tubes do strike the TSP. A bilinear model (consisting of these linear models) presented in this report simulates the characteristics of fluid-elastic instability of loosely <b>supported</b> <b>tubes</b> in stable and unstable regions associated with TSP-inactive modes.

40|$|Pollination in {{flowering}} plants is initiated by germination of pollen grains on stigmas followed by fast growth of pollen tubes representing highly energy-consuming processes. The symplastic isolation of pollen grains and tubes requires import of Suc {{available in the}} apoplast. We show that the functional coupling of Suc cleavage by invertases and uptake of the released hexoses by monosaccharide transporters are critical for pollination in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). Transcript profiling, in situ hybridization, and immunolocalization of extracellular invertases and two monosaccharide transporters in vitro and in vivo support the functional coupling in supplying carbohydrates for pollen germination and tube growth evidenced by spatiotemporally coordinated expression. Detection of vacuolar invertases in maternal tissues by these approaches revealed metabolic cross talk {{between male and female}} tissues and supported the requirement for carbohydrate supply in transmitting tissue during pollination. Tissue-specific expression of an invertase inhibitor and addition of the chemical invertase inhibitor miglitol strongly reduced extracellular invertase activity and impaired pollen germination. Measurements of (competitive) uptake of labeled sugars identified two import pathways for exogenously available Suc into the germinating pollen operating in parallel: direct Suc uptake and via the hexoses after cleavage by extracellular invertase. Reduction of extracellular invertase activity in pollen decreases Suc uptake and severely compromises pollen germination. We further demonstrate that Glc as sole carbon source is sufficient for pollen germination, whereas Suc is <b>supporting</b> <b>tube</b> growth, revealing an important regulatory role of both the invertase substrate and products contributing to a potential metabolic and signaling-based multilayer regulation of pollination by carbohydrates.

Analysis of the polarisation contributions to the j–V curve in FC operation mode was performed using theoretical models, as discussed in the text.

40|$|Background—There is an {{essential}} demand for tissue engineered autologous small-diameter vascular graft, which can function in arterial high pressure and flow circulation. We investigated the potential to engineer a three-layered robust and elastic artery using a novel hemodynamically-equivalent pulsatile bioreactor. Methods and Results—Endothelial cells (ECs), smooth muscle cells (SMCs), and fibroblasts were harvested from bovine aorta. A polyglycolic acid (PGA) sheet and a polycaprolactone sheet seeded with SMCs, and a PGA sheet seeded with fibroblast, were wrapped in turn on a 6 -mm diameter silicone tube and incubated in culture medium for 30 days. The <b>supporting</b> <b>tube</b> was removed, and the lumen was seeded with ECs and incubated for another 2 days. The pulsatile bioreactor culture, under regulated gradual increase in flow and pressure from 0. 2 (0. 5 / 0) L/min and 20 (40 / 15) mm Hg to 0. 6 (1. 4 / 0. 2) L/min and 100 (120 / 80) mm Hg, was performed for an additional 2 weeks (n 10). The engineered vessels acquired distinctly similar appearance and elasticity as native arteries. Scanning electron microscopic examination and Von Willebrand factor staining demonstrated the presence of ECs spread over the lumen. Elastica Van Gieson and Masson Tricrome Stain revealed ample production of elastin and collagen in the engineered grafts. Alpha-SMA and calponin staining showed the presence of SMCs. Tensile tests demonstrated that engineered vessels acquired equivalent ultimate strength and similar elastic characteristics as native arteries (Ultimate Strength of Native: 882133 kPa, Engineered: 827155 kPa, each n 8).
