40|$|Traditional safety {{performance}} requirements for nuclear reactors {{have been developed}} for critical reactors, whose kinetics characteristics differ significantly from <b>sub-critical,</b> accelerator-driven nuclear <b>reactors.</b> In a critical nuclear reactor, relatively small amounts of reactivity (negative or positive) can produce large changes in the fission rate. In <b>sub-critical</b> <b>reactors,</b> the self-multiplication (k) decreases as the sub-criticality (1 -k) increases, and the responsiveness to small reactivity changes decreases. This makes <b>sub-critical</b> nuclear <b>reactors</b> less responsive to positive reactivity insertions than critical reactors. Also, larger negative reactivity insertions are needed in <b>sub-critical</b> <b>reactors</b> to shut down the fission chain if the neutron source remains. This paper presents the results from a computational analysis of the {{safety performance}} of <b>sub-critical,</b> accelerator-driven nuclear <b>reactors.</b> Coupled kinetics and thermal-hydraulics models are used to quantify the effectiveness of traditional protection and control system designs in <b>sub-critical</b> <b>reactors.</b> The analyses also quantify the role of inherent, passive reactivity feedback mechanisms in <b>sub-critical</b> <b>reactors.</b> Computational results are used to develop conclusions regarding the most favorable and effective means for reactor control and protection in <b>sub-critical,</b> accelerator-driven nuclear <b>reactors...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A Co-ordinated Action {{has been}} {{launched}} with the ambition {{to establish a}} durable network on nuclear data efforts {{that are important in}} the context of minimising the high-level waste stream of nuclear energy. This implies optimal incineration of all actinides that nowadays constitute spent nuclear fuel, in critical and <b>sub-critical</b> <b>reactors.</b> As a consequence, the scope of the CA encompasses transmutation in fast critical reactors as well as sub-critical systems (ADS). The purpose is to identify the needs for improved nuclear data, assess the present status of knowledge, and to estimate what accuracy can be reached with state-of-the-art techniques...|$|R
50|$|If {{actinides}} are transmuted in a Subcritical reactor it {{is likely}} that the fuel will have to be able to tolerate more thermal cycles than conventional fuel. An accelerator-driven <b>sub-critical</b> <b>reactor</b> is unlikely to be able to maintain a constant operation period for equally long times as a critical reactor, and each time the accelerator stops then the fuel will cool down.|$|E
50|$|In nuclear physics, {{an energy}} {{amplifier}} {{is a novel}} type of nuclear power reactor, a subcritical reactor, in which an energetic particle beam is used to stimulate a reaction, which in turn releases enough energy to power the particle accelerator and leave an energy profit for power generation. The concept has more recently {{been referred to as}} an accelerator-driven system (ADS) or Accelerator-driven <b>sub-critical</b> <b>reactor.</b>|$|E
50|$|One {{promising}} alternative {{from this}} perspective is an accelerator-driven <b>sub-critical</b> <b>reactor</b> / subcritical reactor. Here a beam of either protons (United States and European designs) or electrons (Japanese design) is directed into a target. In the case of protons, very fast neutrons will spall off the target, while {{in the case of}} the electrons, very high energy photons will be generated. These high-energy neutrons and photons will then be able to cause the fission of the heavy actinides.|$|E
40|$|Partitioning and {{transmutation}} of plutonium, americium, and curium {{is inevitable}} if the radiotoxic inventory of {{spent nuclear fuel}} is to be reduced {{by more than a}} factor of 100. But, admixing minor actinides into the fuel severely degrades system safety parameters, particularly coolant void reactivity, Doppler effect, and (effective) delayed neutron fractions. The incineration process is therefore envisioned to be carried out in dedicated, accelerator-driven <b>sub-critical</b> <b>reactors</b> (ADS). However, ADS cores operating in concert with light-water reactors (two-component scenario) also exhibit high burnup reactivity swing with penalty on the system performance/economy. In the frame of this design work, we attempted, by choice of coolant and optimisation of fuel concept and core design, to achieve favourable neutronic, burnup and safety characteristics of the transuranium ADS burner.

50|$|A {{subcritical}} reactor is {{a nuclear}} fission reactor concept that produces fission without achieving criticality. Instead of a sustaining chain reaction, a subcritical reactor uses additional neutrons from an outside source. There are two general classes of such devices. One uses neutrons {{provided by a}} nuclear fusion machine, a concept known as a fusion-fission hybrid. The other uses neutrons created through spallation of heavy nuclei by charged particles such as protons accelerated by a particle accelerator, a concept known as an accelerator-driven system (ADS) or accelerator-driven <b>sub-critical</b> <b>reactor.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fissile nuclei, like Uranium-235, Plutonium-239 and Uranium-233 {{respond well}} to delayed {{neutrons}} and are thus important to keep a critical reactor stable, and this limits the amount of minor actinides that can be destroyed in a critical reactor. As a consequence {{it is important that}} the chosen matrix allows the reactor to keep the ratio of fissile to non-fissile nuclei high, as this enables it to destroy the long-lived actinides safely. In contrast, the power output of a <b>sub-critical</b> <b>reactor</b> is limited by the intensity of the driving particle accelerator, and thus it need not contain any uranium or plutonium at all. In such a system it may be preferable to have an inert matrix that doesn't produce additional long-lived isotopes.|$|E

Proton and light-ion accelerators in particular have many research, energy and medical applications, providing {{one of the most}} effective treatments for many types of cancer. Ultra high-intensity and high-energy (GeV) proton drivers are a critical technology for accelerator-driven <b>sub-critical</b> <b>reactors</b> (ADS) and many HEP programs (Muon Collider). These high-intensity GeV-range proton drivers are particularly challenging, encountering duty cycle and space-charge limits in the synchrotron and machine size concerns in the weaker-focusing cyclotrons; a 10 - 20 MW proton driver is not presently considered technically achievable with conventional re-circulating accelerators. One, as-yet, unexplored re-circulating accelerator, the Fixed-field Alternating Gradient, or FFAG, is an attractive alternative to the cyclotron. Its strong focusing optics are expected to mitigate space charge effects, and a recent innovation in design has coupled stable tunes with isochronous orbits, making the FFAG capable of fixed-frequency, CW acceleration, as in the classical cyclotron. This paper reports on these new advances in FFAG accelerator technology and references advanced modeling tools for fixed-field accelerators developed for and unique to the code COSY INFINITY.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 6 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 30 June - 2 July, 2008. In Europe a great effort {{has been made in}} the Lead-Bismuth Eutectic (LBE) technology, for use in the <b>sub-critical</b> <b>reactors,</b> and its natural development is represented by the use of pure lead that is less corrosive, chemically inert and in the foreseen environment has good neutronic and thermal-hydraulic characteristics, therefore {{it appears to be a}} suitable coolant for a fast reactor. The main purpose of this study deals with the evaluation of the sloshing dynamic effects of lead coolant during a safety shut down earthquake applied to a conceptual Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) Generation IV (GEN IV) Nuclear Power Plant design, with reference to the ELSY project system configuration that is under development within the ongoing European 7 FW ELSY Program. ELSY is an innovative small size pool-type reactor (600 MWe) cooled by pure lead, characterized by a compact and simple integrated primary circuit; by the way this configuration is favourable from the point of view of the reduction of the seismic loads and of the negative effect of the high lead density. Therefore, the fluid-structure interaction problems and the free oscillations of the heavy metal primary coolant attracted the attention because during a strong motion earthquake the lead surrounding the internals may be accelerated and the so-called hydrodynamic interaction, due to the coolant sloshing, may significantly influence the stress level in the reactor pressure vessel (RPV). To the purpose, the effect of the rigidity of adjacent internals walls and coupling between coolant and vessel are considered An adequate numerical modelling, by means a 3 -D finite element model, was set up and used for the foreseen structures dynamic analysis, due to the inability of linear theory to describe accurately the wave’s motion accounting for the complex considered RPV geometrical aspect as well as the material nonlinearities. Numerical results are presented and discussed highlighting the importance of the fluid-structure interaction effects in terms of stress intensity as well as the capacity of internals and vessel walls to withstand wave’s impact and prevent instabilities. vk 201...|$|R
