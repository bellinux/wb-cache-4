40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop the laboratory-scale melter (LSM) as a quick and {{inexpensive}} method to determine the processing rate of various waste glass <b>slurry</b> <b>feeds.</b> The LSM uses a 3 or 4 in. diameter-fused quartz crucible with feed and off-gas ports on top. This LSM setup allows cold-cap formation above the molten glass to be directly monitored to obtain a steady-state melting rate of the waste glass feeds. The melting rate data from extensive scaled-melter tests with Hanford Site high-level wastes performed for the Hanford Tank Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant have been compiled. Preliminary empirical model that expresses the melting rate as a function of bubbling rate and glass yield were developed from the compiled database. The two waste glass feeds with most melter run data were selected for detailed evaluation and model development and for the LSM tests so the melting rates obtained from LSM tests can be compared with those from scaled-melter tests.

40|$|Integrated coal {{gasification}} combined cycle (IGCC) plants with pre-combustion capture of CO 2 represent {{one of the}} most promising options for power generation with carbon capture and storage. This work investigates to what extent IGCC performance (with and without CO 2 capture) is affected by coal quality for two different entrained flow slagging gasifiers. Based on an IGCC model developed in Aspen Plus and combined with GTPRO, mass and energy balances were computed. Two gasification technologies were considered: A dry feed gasifier with syngas heat recovery which represents the Shell technology, and a <b>slurry</b> <b>feed</b> gasifier with full water quench which represents the GE technology. For each gasifier, five different coals were used and alternatives with and without CO 2 capture calculated. It was found that the thermal efficiency, CO 2 emissions and net power output of the <b>slurry</b> <b>feed</b> IGCC was strongly dependent on coal type, and had lowest performance for low rank coals.

40|$|Coal [...] CO[subscript 2] <b>slurry</b> <b>feed</b> {{has been}} {{suggested}} as an attractive alternative to coal–water <b>slurry</b> <b>feed</b> for single-stage, entrained-flow gasifiers. Previous work demonstrated the system-level advantages of gasification-based plants equipped with CO[subscript 2] capture and CO[subscript 2] <b>slurry</b> <b>feed,</b> {{under the assumption that}} carbon conversion remains unchanged. However, gasification in carbon dioxide has been observed to be slower than that in steam. In view of this, the impact of CO[subscript 2] slurry feeding on gasification kinetics and ultimately on carbon conversion and oxygen consumption in a pressurized, single-stage entrained-flow gasifier processing bituminous coal is studied here using a 1 -D reduced order model. Results show that the CO[subscript 2] gasification reaction plays a dominant role in char conversion when the feeding system is CO[subscript 2] slurry, increasing the CO content in the products by up to a factor of two. CO inhibition of the gasification reaction and a higher degree of internal mass transport limitations lead to an up to 60 % slower gasification rate, when compared to a system based on coal-water slurry. Accordingly, a gasifier with CO[subscript 2] <b>slurry</b> <b>feed</b> has 15 % less oxygen consumption but a 7 %-point lower carbon conversion for a given reactor outlet temperature. The gasifier outlet temperature must be raised by 90 K in order to achieve the same conversion as in a water slurry-fed reactor; the peak reactor temperature increases by 220 K as a result. Net oxygen savings of 8 % are estimated for a system with a CO[subscript 2] slurry-fed gasifier relative to one with water slurry and the same level of conversion. BP (Firm...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScEng) [...] Stellenbosch University, 1986 ENGLISH ABSTRACT: High turbulence, {{high shear}} forces and high {{centrifugal}} forces characterise the flow in hydrocyclones. These characteristics are employed advantageously in the air-sparged hydrocyclone {{so that a}} space time of only one second is necessary for effective flotation. Conventional flotation processes {{on the other hand}} require a few minutes. Flotation of pyrite from a coarse Witwatersrand ore (100 % - 300 micron; 92 % + 38 micron) produces a sulphur recovery of 90 % with a sulphur grade of 40 % in the concentrate when the content of solids of the <b>slurry</b> <b>feed</b> equals 10 %. Higher recoveries up to 93 % are possible when slurries with a higher content of solids (e. g. 30 %) are used. However, the sulphur grade then decreases to about 35 %. Flotation in a batch cell produces a recovery of sulphur of 95 % with a sulphur grade of 40 %, but in this case a flotation time of 5 minutes is required. A hydrocyclone with a diameter of 50 mm and a length of 410 mm produces optimum results at a <b>slurry</b> <b>feed</b> rate of 35 to 40 l/min and an air-flow rate of 200 l/min. An air-flow rate of about 150 l/min is adequate at <b>slurry</b> <b>feed</b> rates lower than 35 l/min. Flotation of particles finer than 38 micron is more successful at higher <b>slurry</b> <b>feed</b> rates. The optimum flotation of coarse particles (i. e. + 106 micron) occurs at lower feed rates. The best flotation results are obtained in the size fraction between 38 and 75 micron, which produces a recovery and content of sulphur of 95 % and 51 % respectively. A collector concentrate of 160 g/ton, which is thrice the quantity used in conventional processes, is required. The best recoveries at <b>slurry</b> <b>feed</b> rates lower than 35 l/min are obtained when the frother concentrate is low (approximately 20 mg/l). A higher frother concentrate, i. e. between 50 to 60 mg/l, is required at higher feed rates. The air-sparged hydrocyclone may be used effectively for rougher flotation and especially for the flotation of ore finer than 150 micron. The use of a specially designed pedestal can minimize blockage of the underflow. Such a pedestal has been designed and tested successfully. MINTE...|$|E

40|$|During the {{development}} of the feed processing flowsheet for the Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) at the Savannah River Site (SRS), research had shown that use of formic acid (HCOOH) could accomplish several processing objectives with one chemical addition. These objectives included the decomposition of tetraphenylborate, chemical reduction of mercury, production of acceptable rheological properties in the <b>feed</b> <b>slurry,</b> and controlling the oxidation state of the glass melt pool. However, the DEPF research had not shown that some vitrification <b>slurry</b> <b>feeds</b> had a tendency to evolve hydrogen (H{sub 2 }) and ammonia (NH{sub 3 }) as the result of catalytic decomposition of CHOOH with noble metals (rhodium, ruthenium, palladium) in the feed. Testing conducted at Pacific Northwest Laboratory and later at the Savannah River Technical Center showed that the H{sub 2 } and NH{sub 3 } could evolve at appreciable rates and quantities. The explosive nature of H{sub 2 } and NH{sub 3 } (as ammonium nitrate) warranted significant mitigation control and redesign of both facilities. At the time the explosive gas evolution was discovered, the DWPF was already under construction and an immediate hardware fix in tandem with flowsheet changes was necessary. However, the Hanford Waste Vitrification Plant (HWVP) was in the design phase and could afford to take time to investigate flowsheet manipulations that could solve the problem, rather than a hardware fix. Thus, the HWVP began to investigate alternatives to using HCOOH in the vitrification process.

Experiments were {{performed in a}} 0. 15 m diameter laboratory batch spouted bed using 13 different seed types and two fertilizer coatings - monocalcium phosphate (MCP) and tricalcium phosphate (TCP) - with a methylcellulose binder. Gas superficial velocity, bed height and temperature, orifice size, coating strength and flow rate were varied during experiments. The <b>slurry</b> <b>feed</b> rate is limited by spout collapse caused by the formation of embryo agglomerates in the spray zone {{at the bottom of}} the spout. The formation of agglomerates is determined by a balance between binding forces which are related to seed and coating properties, and shearing forces which are determined by bed hydrodynamics. The spout collapses before exit air from the bed is completely saturated with water. The relative humidity of the exit air at spout collapse increases with increasing excess air velocity and particle size, decreases with increasing feed slurry viscosity and is independent of bed height and temperature. Attrition of newly formed coating is the main mechanism to generate elutriated fines. The elutriation rate increases linearly with feed slurry rate and with gas velocity to the third power. It is a strong function of coating strength. Two attrition models - the inlet gas kinetic energy model and the excess energy model - were examined. The inlet gas kinetic energy model best explains the elutriation data from these experiments at constant orifice size (25 mm). However, when the inlet orifice size is decreased, the increase in elutriation is less than predicted by the increase in inlet gas kinetic energy. The mechanistic models used in this work may also be relevant to other spouted bed granulation and coating processes...|$|E
