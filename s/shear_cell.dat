An in vitro model of shear induced neurodegeneration was established in order to elucidate the mechanism of neurodegeneration in glaucomas hydrocephalus and head injury. The model consisted of a differentiated human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY 5 Y, which was exposed to shear stresses of various magnitudes and durations in a controlled environment. Application of shear to differentiated SH-SY 5 Y cells led to loss of viability.
