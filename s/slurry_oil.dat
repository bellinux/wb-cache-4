Colloid mill or {{high-speed}} shearing mechanical is used {{in traditional}} preparation technology of SBS modified asphalt for the dispersion of SBS in matrix asphalt, {{which leads to the}} high equipment cost in production of SBS modified asphalt. The fractions oil of FCC <b>slurry</b> <b>oil</b> distillation with a high content of aromatics is a good swelling agent of SBS. The FCC distillation residual (FR) with high softening point can resolve the problem that penetration increased when the addition of swelling agent increased. SBS is pre-swelled by the heavier fractions from FCC <b>slurry</b> <b>oil,</b> and then it will be dispersed in the vacuum residuum (VR) by simple mechanical stirring to prepare SBS modified asphalt due to the perfect swelling effects in this work. The influences of different materials, distillation yield and ratio of FR to VR on the performance of SBS modified asphalt have been investigated.

The poisonous basic nitrogen compounds could reversibly adsorb onto the acid site of catalyst, resulting in a diminution of acid centers, or acted as coke precursors due to their size and aromatic nature [6]. Fu and schaffer [7] and Ho et al.

Nevertheless, Li et al. [9, 10] argued that the effect of structure and composition of basic nitrogen compounds was much more obvious than that of nitrogen content.

Both types of structured catalysts were studied using the following physicochemical techniques: specific surface area measurements (BET), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

40|$|Boiler {{feedwater}} {{and steam}} {{have to be}} of high purity, because of the susceptibility of the steam-water cycle to corrosion. Organic contaminants break down in boilers by hydrothermolysis, leading {{to the formation of}} organic acid anions, which are suspected to cause corrosion of steam-water cycle components. The impact and behavior of organic decomposition products in the steam-water cycle are not well understood. While guidelines for organic contaminants are becoming stricter, organic treatment chemicals are gaining popularity. Some alkalizing amines show potential for protecting steam-water cycles against corrosion, but their thermal stability is limited and acidic decomposition products are a concern. There are no official guidelines for the application of alkalizing amines in fossil-fired plants, because their thermal stability in the hottest sections of the plant is unknown. This thesis aims to contribute to well-founded guidelines for organic contamination and amine application in steam-water cycles to facilitate effective water treatment and chemical dosing. It does so by investigating the thermal decomposition of organic contaminants and treatment chemicals and using results to conduct corrosion experiments. To investigate hydrothermal reactions both batch and continuous flow reactors were tested, and it was concluded that the latter are better at investigating (hydro) thermolysis of organic treatment chemicals. A flow reactor gives precise control over retention time, temperature and pressure and these parameters can be changed much faster than with a batch reactor. The flow reactor was the basis for virtually all thermal stability and decomposition experiments described in this thesis. It was found that lower heating rates give more organic acid anions as degradation products of organic carbon, both in quantity and species variety. Thermal stability of the decomposition products determines which of these products is most prevalent. As boiler temperature increased, acetate became the dominant degradation product, due to its higher thermal stability. Shorter retention times led to more variety and quantity of organic acid anions, {{due to a lack of}} time for the thermally less stable ones to degrade. The absence of oxygen increased the thermal stability of decomposition products. The (hydro) thermolysis of monoethylene glycol and <b>slurry</b> <b>oil</b> produced up to a few hundred ppb acetate and formate. The (hydro) thermolysis of polyethylene glycol produced a high variety and quantity of organic acid anions, that could only partially be determined to be in the lower ppm range. The (hydro) thermolysis of the water dissolvable fraction of gasoil, naphtha and hydro wax did not lead to an increase in organic acid anions. Methyl ethyl ketoxime thermally degraded into several organic acid anions and nitrite in the higher ppb or lower ppm range. By using the flow reactor to investigate amine thermal stability, it was concluded that thermolysis under superheater conditions was more rapid than hydrothermolysis under boiler conditions. Anionic decomposition products increased linearly over time, while the thermal decomposition of morpholine followed first order kinetics. Metal catalysis of amine thermolysis caused by oxides on the inner surface of superheater tubes was investigated by using varying sizes and elemental composition. Kinetics of morpholine and ethanolamine thermolysis decreased as the tube size increased. The relation between the surface:volume ratio and the degradation rate constant was linear. Although results varied between the two applied tubing materials, there is no consistent trend that can link thermolysis kinetics to tube wall composition. The thermolysis of five alkalizing amines and two organic acids was comprehensively tested at superheater conditions. Morpholine, ethanolamine, cyclohexylamine, dimethylamine, 3 -methoxypropylamine and acetic acid were shown to undergo thermolysis according to first order kinetics. The activation energy, prefactor and activation volume were obtained from the experimental data for all investigated amines. Dimethylamine did not fully degrade, in spite of longer retention times being applied, suggesting synthesis may occur. Formic acid is very unstable under steam water cycle conditions. It is still found in high temperature and pressure steam-water cycles, though, and therefore it could be hypothesized that it is synthesized in the condensing stages. Acetic acid has higher thermal stability than all other tested compounds and is therefore the dominant organic acid anion at high temperatures. Cationic degradation products were ammonia and some amines, meaning that the complete thermolysis of an amine does not necessarily lead to acidic conditions, as the formed ammonia also provides protection. A model was constructed to predict the thermal stability of the amines in steam-water cycle. More plant data is necessary to fully validate the model. Runs conducted with an experimental two-phase flow-accelerated corrosion loop showed a linear relation between liquid film pH and obtained corrosion rates for the same steam quality. The tested steam quality was not high enough to create the conditions in which ammonia provides insufficient protection against acetic acid, but expanding the liquid film pH model to higher steam qualities does give an idea of the dangers of high acetate concentrations in a steam-water cycle. The models for calculating the pH of the liquid film in two-phase flow and amine thermolysis (if validated) could be connected to assess if alkalizing amine application is recommended for a specific steam-water cycle. In general, it can be concluded from the results that ethanolamine provides better protection against two-phase flow-accelerated corrosion in the presence of organic acid anions, so there is a maximum superheater temperature for each amine at which it can be applied. When ammonia is the only volatile treatment chemical protecting the steam-water cycle, organic acid anions in the plant should be reduced until theoretical pH drop of the two-phase liquid film is acceptable.

An example is partial hydrogenation of vegetable oil which is traditionally carried out in a batch autoclave by bubbling hydrogen gas though a <b>slurry</b> of <b>oil</b> and solid catalyst particles containing Ni. Unwanted trans fatty acids (TFAs) are formed during this process due to the scarcity of hydrogen at the active catalyst sites. Here we investigate the use of metal-decorated integral-asymmetric polymer membranes to enable the supply of dissolved hydrogen near the location where the liquid oil phase contacts the catalyst. Hydrogen gas is supplied to the porous substructure of the asymmetric membrane where it dissolves in the thin skin layer of the membrane and emerges as dissolved hydrogen on the metal-decorated side of the membrane where the oil is present. Temperature and pressure are compatible with existing facilities. All membranes produced low TFA (2. 6 – 4. 6 wt% at Iodine Value of 95) compared to the slurry process. A 1000 metric ton per day soybean oil hydrogenation facility would require 2 – 3000 m[superscript] 2 membrane area {{with a total of}} 90 g of Pt metal catalyst. This could be envisioned as metal sputtered hollow fibers packaged in conventional modules...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} {{describe}} CiDRA's patented clamp-on, passive sonar array-based flow meter technology which performs two fundamental and independent measurements – flow rate and entrained air. Firstly, the meter provides the {{volumetric flow rate}} of the mixture by measuring {{the speed at which}} naturally occurring turbulent structures convect with the flow past an axial array of sensors wrapped around existing process pipe. Secondly, the meter utilizes similar sonar-based processing techniques and the naturally occurring acoustical propagation in the process pipe to measure sound speed and hence the entrained air levels in slurries and fluids. This unique ability enables robust, reliable flow measurements {{in a wide variety of}} flows – high solids content <b>slurries,</b> heavy <b>oils,</b> bitumen flows and liquids/slurries with entrained air content. Also to be presented in this paper is the adoption and application of CiDRA’s SONARtrac™ product technology in a variety of oil sands, oil & gas, and minerals processing applications, helping to address the needs of measurement integrity, reliability and value delivery to the customer. In addition, case studies will be presented describing how the clamp-on sonar-based technology can be leveraged and applied to help characterize and deliver new insight into fluid mechanics of slurries and fluids in these industries, leveraging the two fundamental measurements of the clamp-on, passive sonar-based technology into new product extensions such as velocity profiling, gas hold-up for column flotation and secondary-phase measurement for density-based meters in the presence of air/gas...|$|R
40|$|A labscale {{pressure}} filter has beer, developed {{to study the}} filtration behaviour of diluted crude palm <b>oil</b> <b>slurry.</b> The apparatus mainly consists of two parts viz. a mixer and a filter which are placed in a oven for controlling operating temperature. The system is connected to a data acquisition system for recording data of applied pressure, medium pressure, filter temperature, weight of filtrate and mixer speed in a spread sheet. Filtration of DCPOS was carried out at a temperature range 60 C â€“ 90 C and applied pressure 1 bar - 4 bar using a polyester multifilament woven cloth as filter medium. The results {{have shown that the}} filter System Was fully capable and suitable to be used to study filtration behaviour of DCPOS. The optimum process condition to give he highest filtration rate was at 2 bar and 90 C. The effect of pressure and temperature to the filtrate flowrate and cake compressibility were also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Hydrated filler-type {{flame retardants}} were coated with {{approximately}} a monolayer of stearic acid using a solvent technique. Compared to the uncoated powders, the BET surface area was lower, the powder packing density was improved, and the thickening effect on white oil was significantly reduced. The latter two observations are rationalized {{in terms of}} a reduction in the attractive interactions between the powder particles. The viscosity of white <b>oil</b> <b>slurries</b> containing 25 wt % solids showed shear-thinning non-Newtonian behavior. The coated powders showed significantly lower viscosities at low shear rates although the difference diminished at high shear rates. The lower viscosities shown by the coated powders indicate that the surface modification facilitated the break-up of agglomerates and the dispersion of individual particles in the fluid.

5000|$|Graphite is mined by both {{open pit}} and {{underground}} methods. Graphite usually needs beneficiation. This may {{be carried out}} by hand-picking the pieces of gangue (rock) and hand-screening the product or by crushing the rock and floating out the graphite. Beneficiation by flotation encounters the difficulty that graphite is very soft and [...] "marks" [...] (coats) the particles of gangue. This makes the [...] "marked" [...] gangue particles float off with the graphite, yielding impure concentrate. There are two ways of obtaining a commercial concentrate or product: repeated regrinding and floating (up to seven times) to purify the concentrate, or by acid leaching (dissolving) the gangue with hydrofluoric acid (for a silicate gangue) or hydrochloric acid (for a carbonate gangue). In milling, the incoming graphite products and concentrates can be ground before being classified (sized or screened), with the coarser flake size fractions (below 8 mesh, 8-20 mesh, 20-50 mesh) carefully preserved, and then the carbon contents are determined. Some standard blends can be prepared from the different fractions, each with a certain flake size distribution and carbon content. Custom blends can also be made for individual customers who want a certain flake size distribution and carbon content. If flake size is unimportant, the concentrate can be ground more freely. Typical end products include a fine powder for use as a <b>slurry</b> in <b>oil</b> drilling and coatings for foundry molds, carbon raiser in the steel industry (Synthetic graphite powder and powdered petroleum coke can also be used as carbon raiser). Environmental impacts from graphite mills consist of air pollution including fine particulate exposure of workers and also soil contamination from powder spillages leading to heavy metal contamination of soil.|$|R
40|$|Abrasives {{have been}} {{recovered}} from the slurry 	wasted of the factory where the silicon wafers for solar battery 	are processed. The <b>slurry</b> consists of <b>oil</b> and abrasives and is used 	in the wire saw. The viscosity of the slurry is carefully controlled 	to maintain a high cutting performance though {{it tends to be}} high 	as the silicon powder is accumulated in the slurry. The cutting 	performance of the slurry decreases as the amount of the silicon 	powder increases. The abrasives, however, still have enough 	performance to cut the silicon wafers. Iron segments of the wire 	saw were found to attach to the SiC abrasives. The iron segments 	magnetize the abrasives in the mechanochemical process and thus 	reduce the cutting performance of the abrasives. Due to the iron 	segments presence the abrasives with poor cutting performance 	could be separated from the slurry by means of superconducting 	magnetic separator. After the magnetic separation a centrifugal 	separator was used to separate the silicon powder. It was confirmed 	that the superconducting magnetic separation is applicable 	to this practical application...|$|R
