30|$|The {{scope of}} {{previous}} studies in the literature has been dedicated to evaluating the effect of notches on the strength, fracture toughness, damage and failure mechanisms of both laminated (Awerbuch and Madhukar 1985; Callus 2007) and 2 D woven composites (Yudhanto et al. 2012 a, b). It was observed that the undulating nature of the woven fabric improves the delamination and <b>splitting</b> <b>resistance</b> compared to 2 D laminates as it helped in preventing crack propagation within the matrix and acted as crack stoppers. Thus, the notched strength of the 2 D woven laminates {{was reported to be}} higher than the laminated composites. In other words, 2 D woven composites were found to be less notch sensitive (Naik et al. 1990; Shembekar and Naik 1992). Replacing 2 D with 3 D woven composites helped in achieving further enhancement of the notched strength and fracture toughness, along the fibre direction, of composites as reported in (Cox et al. 1996; Tsai et al. 2000). The effect of the through-thickness binder in 3 D woven composites was clearly observed as a dramatic decrease in the notch sensitivity of 3 D woven composites and significant improvement of the fracture toughness and damage tolerance compared with those of 2 D woven laminates.|$|E

40|$|Head <b>splitting</b> <b>resistance</b> (HSR) in cabbage is an {{important}} trait closely related to both qual-ity and yield of head. However, the genetic control of this trait remains unclear. In this study, a doubled haploid (DH) population derived from an intra-cross between head splitting-sus-ceptible inbred cabbage line 79 – 156 and resistant line 96 – 100 was obtained and used to analyze inheritance and detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for HSR using a mixed major gene/polygene inheritance analysis and QTL mapping. HSR {{can be attributed to}} additive-epistatic effects of three major gene pairs combined with those of polygenes. Negative and significant correlations were also detected between head Hsr and head vertical diameter (Hvd), head transverse diameter (Htd) and head weight (Hw).

40|$|In {{predicting}} the likely behaviour of precast prestressed concrete flooring systems in fire using advanced finite element methods, an improved numerical model using the non-linear finite element program SAFIR {{has been developed}} in order to investigate the effects and {{the interaction of the}} surrounding structures and has been used extensively throughout this thesis. Note that fire induced spalling is not included in the analysis. In the numerical investigation of the new model, the reinforced concrete topping is modelled as part of the beam elements in order to predict the behaviour of single hollowcore concrete slabs, with various support conditions, under a Standard ISO fire. It is shown that the current approach using tendons that are anchored into the supporting beams leads to a major problem for precast prestressed flooring systems. In order to resolve this problem, a multi-spring connection model has been developed to include the old and new connection systems corresponding to the New Zealand Concrete Standard NZS 3101. The connection model with hollowcore slabs is validated against a published fire test. The investigation on restrained hollowcore floors is performed with various parameters and boundary support conditions. Numerical studies on various boundary support conditions show that the behaviour of hollowcore floors in fire is very sensitive to the existence of side beams. Further investigations on the effects of fire emergency beams, which reduce the transverse curvature of floors to improve fire resistance, are made on 4 x 1 multi-bay hollowcore floors with different arrangements of theses beams. The numerical studies show that fire emergency beams significantly increase the fire resistance. Code based equations which can calculate the shear resistance and <b>splitting</b> <b>resistance</b> are then introduced. The Eurocode equation can be modified with high temperature material properties to estimate the shear capacity of a hollowcore slab. The modified Eurocode equation which is fit to fire situations validated against the published literature with respect to shear tests in fire. The structural behaviour of single tee slabs having different axial restraint stiffness as well as the variation of axial thrust in fire is then studied. SAFIR analyses of single tee slabs show that fire performance can increase when a web support type is used that has high axial restraint stiffness. A series of test results on prestressed flat slabs conducted in United States are used to validate a simply supported numerical model. The application of multi-spring connection elements is also investigated in order to examine the feasibility of continuity...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if using a new form of creatine monohydrate (Phosphagems -EAS) could increase muscular strength and favorably alter body composition. Twenty-seven college-aged Ss were randomly placed into a placebo or creatine group. Subjects in the creatine group were required to ingest 20 grams maintenance of the supplement for 5 days (loading phase) and 5 grams everyday thereafter (phase), while the placebo group took an identical looking and tasting product. The supplement or placebo was distributed in a double-blind protocol. Ss performed 1 RMs for the bench press and squat, and body composition was measured using hydrostatic weighing before and after supplementation/training. For the training program, both groups participated in a 6 week, 4 day <b>split,</b> <b>resistance</b> training program. Supplementation began the first week of the resistance program. The posttests were performed the week following the completion of the resistance program. Data were analyzed using a 2 -way ANOVA with repeated measures and a Tukey's post hoc test. Both groups increased significantly (p . 05). Total body and lean body weight increased significantly in the creatine group only (p <. 05). Total body weight increased 5. 4 lbs, with 4. 8 lbs being lean body weight. No changes were found in % body fat or fat weight in either group. The results of this study indicate that creatine monohydrate does not improve muscular strength and/or body composition. However, the results of this research suggest that through a scientifically sound resistance training program, significant strength gains will occur along with slight improvements in body composition.

J Strength Cond Res 23 (4) : 1321 - 1326, 2009 -The {{purpose of our}} study was to compare strength gains after 12 weeks of nonperiodized (NP), linear periodized (LP), and nonlinear periodized (NLP) resistance training models using split training routines. Twenty-seven strength-trained men were recruited and {{randomly assigned to one}} of 3 balanced groups: NP, LP, and NLP. Strength gains in the leg press and in the bench press exercises were assessed. There were no differences between the training groups in the exercise pre-tests (p > 0. 05) (i. e., bench press and leg press). the NLP group was the only group to significantly increase maximum strength in the bench press throughout the 12 -week training period. in this group, upper-body strength increased significantly from pre-training to 4 weeks (p < 0. 0001), from 4 to 8 weeks (p = 0. 004), and from 8 weeks to the post-training (p < 0. 02). the NLP group also exhibited an increase in leg press 1 repetition maximum at each time point (pre-training to 4 weeks, 4 - 8 week, and 8 weeks to post-training, p < 0. 0001). the LP group demonstrated strength increases only after the eight training week (p = 0. 02). There were no further strength increases from the 8 -week to the post-training test. the NP group showed no strength increments after the 12 -week training period. No differences were observed in the anthropometric profiles among the training models. in summary, our data suggest that NLP was more effective in increasing both upper- and lower-body strength for trained subjects using split routines.

40|$|Plasmid-based genetic {{systems in}} Escherichia coli are {{a staple of}} {{synthetic}} biology. However, the use of plasmids imposes limitations {{on the size of}} synthetic gene circuits and the ease with which they can be placed into bacterial hosts. For instance, unique selective markers must be used for each plasmid to ensure their maintenance in the host. These selective markers are most often genes encoding resistance to antibiotics such as ampicillin or kanamycin. However, the simultaneous use of multiple antibiotics to retain different plasmids can place undue stress on the host and increase the cost of growth media. To address this problem, we have developed a method for stably transforming three different plasmids in E. coli using a single antibiotic selective marker. To do this, we first examined two different systems with which two plasmids may be maintained. These systems make use of either T 7 RNA polymerase-specific regulation of the <b>resistance</b> gene or <b>split</b> antibiotic <b>resistance</b> enzymes encoded on separate plasmids. Finally, we combined the two methods to create a system with which three plasmids can be transformed and stably maintained using a single selective marker.

Chapters two and three investigate the mechanical properties of these composites and demonstrate that nearly every resulting composite demonstrates an improved flexural modulus and energy release rate upon <b>splitting.</b> Fire <b>resistance</b> of these composites was also investigated and indicates that the heat release rate, total heat released, and char yield were significantly improved upon for all silicone composites compared to the untreated cellulosic material. Chapter four looks specifically at aspen-silicone composites for thermo-oxidative studies under applied loads in order to study the effect of silicone incorporation on the failure kinetics of aspen. The aspen-silicone composites tested under these conditions demonstrated significantly longer lifetimes under the same loading and heating conditions compared with untreated aspen. ^ The second part of this thesis focuses on studying ionic liquids as potentially useful solvents and reaction media for poly(vinyl alcohol). Two ionic liquids (1 -Butyl- 3 -methylimidizolium chloride and tributylethylphosphonium diethylphosphate) were found to readily dissolve PVOH. More importantly, we have demonstrated that these solvents can be used as inert reaction media for PVOH modification. Both ionic liquids were found to facilitate the quantitative esterification of PVOH, while only the phosphonium ionic liquid supports the quantitative urethanation of the polymer. In an attempt to tune the surface properties of ionic liquid/polymer solutions, PVOH was also partially esterified with low surface energy substituents. Both surface tension and surface composition of the ionic liquid/polymer solutions can be manipulated by the stoichiometric addition of low surface energy acid chlorides. This work on the modification of PVOH can be directly applied to the modification of polysaccharides such as cellulose which could have important implications from a sustainability and energy standpoint. ...|$|R

In the observations conducted on changes in the easily split off iron of labeled erythrocytes from young ones to aged ones after intravenous injection of Fe(59) -globulin into blood-depleted anemic rabbits, the easily split off iron content is greatest in the regenerating stage and least in the mature stage; whereas in the aging stage it again tends to increasa slightly.

40|$|The {{quantity}} of infections caused by enterococci, in particular E. faecalis and E. faecium, {{has been increasing}} {{in the field of}} human medicine within the last years. Resistances to important antimicrobial agents have been increasing in this genus simultaneously. A connection with the application of antimicrobial agents in livestock farming is supposed. The target {{of this study was to}} determine the resistance behaviour of strains of enterococci isolated from cattle, pigs and food made of these animal species. Minced meat, raw sausages, ham and soft cheese were chosen for the analysis in particular since these could contain enterococci of animal origin and are intended to be consumed uncooked. Sixty herds of cattle (young bulls and calves), ninety seven herds of pigs and one hundred and sixty-six food samples from different regions of Germany were investigated. 1257 strains of enterococci were isolated out of them and identified to the species level. The genus Enterococcus was confirmed using the catalase test, pyrrolidonylarylamidase test and testing for growth in BHI broth with 6. 5 % NaCl. The species was diagnosed by examining haemolysis behaviour, pigment production, motility, the ability to reduce tetrazolium, the presence of arginine dihydrolase and a series of hydrocarbonate <b>splitting</b> tests. The <b>resistance</b> of five hundred and sixty-nine selected strains was determined to penicillin, ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, gentamicin, tetracycline, erythromycin, tylosin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, enrofloxacin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, chloramphenicol, bacitracin, flavomycin and avilamycin using the microbroth dilution method. Strains possessing a mimimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) to gentamicin higher than or equal to 256 mg/l were checked for high-level resistance with the Etest method. Glycopeptide-resistant strains were tested for the resistance genes vanA, vanB, vanC 1 and vanC 2 using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Resistance to penicillin occured in 11 %, 31 % and 4 % of the E. faecium strains isolated from cattle, pigs and food, respectively. Resistance to ampicillin and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid was found in 3 % of the E. faecium isolates from pigs. The remaining strains (with the exception of one E. durans/hirae isolate) were susceptible to these beta-lactam antibiotics. High-level resistance to gentamicin was restricted to 2 % of the E. faecalis strains isolated from pigs and 1 % of the E. faecalis strains isolated from food. VanA-mediated high level resistance to glycopeptide antibiotics was found exclusively in three E. faecium strains isolated from pigs. Resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin was observed in 56 %, 57 % and 23 % of the E. faecium strains isolated from cattle, pigs and food, respectively. The resistance rates of E. faecalis and E. faecium to tetracycline ranged between 16 % (E. faecalis isolated from cattle) and 37 % (E. faecalis isolated from pigs), to erythromycin between 6 % (E. faecalis isolated from cattle) and 49 % (E. faecium isolated from pigs) and to chloramphenicol between 4 % (E. faecium isolated from food) and 22 % (E. faecium isolated from cattle). E. faecalis (33 % susceptible strains isolated from cattle) was more susceptible to enrofloxacin than E. faecium (0 % susceptible strains isolated from cattle). The resistances to the antimicrobial growth promoters ranged from 0 % (E. faecium isolated from cattle to tylosin) to 100 % (E. faecium isolated from food to flavomycin). Cattle and pigs seem to have only little importance as a reservoir of enterococci with resistances to ampicillin, gentamicin and the glycopepetide antibiotics, which are the agents of choice for the treatment of enterococcal infections in human medicine. The risk for the consumers to acquire such resistant enterococci via the food chain seems to be very small. Compared with this the resistance rate to the recently approved antimicrobial agent quinupristin/dalfopristin is rather high in E. faecium isolated from cattle, pigs and food. This problem is probably caused by the former use of the antimicrobial growth promoter virginiamycin in conventional animal fattening. Virginiamycin causes cross-resistances to quinupristin/dalfopristin in enterococci and has been banned in the EU since 1999. This ban is probably followed by a decrease of resistances to quinupristin/dalfopristin. Resistances to antimicrobial agents, which have importance in veterinary and human medicine but only a low significance in the treatment of enterococcal infections, e. g. tetracycline or erythromycin, were partly found quite frequently. A transfer of resistance genes to other genera of bacteria cannot be ruled out. This may imply a risk for the consumers, on the other hand the use of a certain {{quantity of}} antimicrobial active agents for the treatment of bacterial infections in farm animals seems to be indispensible. The risk for the consumers to acquire enterococci, which are resistant to the agents of choice for the treatment of enterococcal infections, via the food chain seems to be very small...|$|R
