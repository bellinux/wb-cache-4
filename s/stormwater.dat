5|$|Roaring Brook has a {{high level}} of water quality {{downstream}} as far as Cobbs Gap. However, in its lower reaches, it is impacted by urban storm impacts and abandoned mining land. Silt from the DeNaples Auto Parts property washed into the stream in 1991. There are also <b>stormwater</b> impacts and combined sewer overflows in its lower reaches. Most of the <b>stormwater</b> flowing into the stream is associated with a combined sewer system in Scranton and Dunmore. Some highways in the watershed contribute <b>stormwater</b> as well. It is also affected by <b>stormwater</b> from the Daleville Shopping area, the village of Elmhurst, the borough of Moscow, Pennsylvania Route 435, Pennsylvania Route 590, and Pennsylvania Route 690. There are 12 <b>stormwater</b> detention facilities in the watershed's lower reaches.|$|E
5|$|Abrahams Creek {{is one of}} 19 {{streams in}} Luzerne County to be {{designated}} for <b>stormwater</b> management.|$|E
5|$|Construct {{treatment}} wetlands as <b>Stormwater</b> Treatment Areas throughout , {{that would}} decrease {{the amount of}} pollutants in the environment.|$|E
5|$|Improve water {{deliveries}} to estuaries {{to reduce}} the rapid discharge of excess water to the Caloosahatchee and St. Lucie estuaries that upset nutrient balances and cause lesions on fish. <b>Stormwater</b> discharge would be sent instead to reservoirs.|$|E
5|$|The {{monument}} {{is equipped}} with a good drainage system to cater to the area's high <b>stormwater</b> run-off. To prevent flooding, 100 spouts are installed at each corner, each with a unique carved gargoyle {{in the shape of a}} giant or makara.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that Leggetts Creek sometimes exceeds its total maximum daily load, especially during low flow conditions and the summer months. There are some mine drainage issues on the creek between Rockwell Avenue and Charles Street. It experiences some flow loss to underground mine voids. In 1978, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources (now known as the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection) estimated that the creek lost 20 to 30 percent of its flow to mines during dry weather. However, the creek is large enough that this does not cause aquatic habitat to be lost. The Chinchilla sewage treatment plant discharges into the creek {{in the vicinity of}} Leggetts Gap. In its lower reaches, the creek is impacted by past mining, urban development, and debris. <b>Stormwater</b> also flows into the Lackawanna River via the creek and it is affected by fine sediment. There is one <b>stormwater</b> detention facility in the watershed, at Leggett's Creek Estates.|$|E
5|$|Neighborhoods in the {{vicinity}} of Eddy Creek include the Keystone Industrial Park, the Keystone Sanitary Landfill, and LaCapra Stone & Supply. It is estimated that there is one <b>stormwater</b> detention facility in the watershed. According to a 1992 report, development in an area near the creek would have little adverse impact on the creek.|$|E
5|$|The {{city has}} several {{departments}} {{providing services to}} its residents, including a police department, municipal courts, garbage collection, planning and zoning, parks and recreational programs, engineering, street maintenance, water and wastewater services, and <b>stormwater</b> treatment. Marysville contracts with regional districts for other services, including a public library, public transport, electricity, natural gas, and fire protection.|$|E
5|$|Toby Creek is {{the main}} source of {{flooding}} in Courtdale, Dallas, Luzerne, Pringle, and Kingston Township. It {{is also one of the}} main sources of flooding in the borough of Kingston. However, the creek's floods cause little damage in Courtdale, since its floodplain is relatively undeveloped in that borough. The creek has an Act 167 <b>Stormwater</b> Management Plan.|$|E
5|$|Wastewater and <b>stormwater</b> are {{collected}} and {{treated by the}} municipal government before being discharged into the Stillaguamish River basin. Arlington's municipal solid waste and single-stream recycling collection and disposal services are contracted by the municipal government to Waste Management; the Snohomish County government and Republic Services also operate a transfer station in Arlington.|$|E
5|$|Wastewater {{networks}} may sustain damage {{similar to}} water supply networks. It {{is very difficult}} to exclude ash from the sewerage system. Systems with combined storm water/sewer lines are most at risk. Ash will enter sewer lines where there is inflow/infiltration by <b>stormwater</b> through illegal connections (e.g., from roof downpipes), cross connections, around manhole covers or through holes and cracks in sewer pipes.|$|E
5|$|Since {{settlement}} it {{has repeatedly}} flooded, sometimes with disastrous consequences. Adelaide's western suburbs were especially {{prone to flooding}} due to their location on the river's alluvial fan. As development of Adelaide progressed the amount of rainfall required for flooding decreased and consequent damage increased. Increased <b>stormwater</b> runoff, modification of the river's banks and other changes all served to exacerbate the problem. Work done by various groups to minimise flooding was often counter productive {{with the creation of}} levees, moving and widening channels and other works simply shifting the flooding elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Stafford Meadow Brook {{has very}} high water quality as far {{downstream}} {{as the old}} Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad corridor. The stream has received little impact from development above the Williams Bridge Reservoir. However, its banks are affected by urban debris such as yard waste {{in some parts of}} its lower reaches. Municipal sewers also sometimes overflow into the stream during rainy conditions. The borough of Moosic has a permit to discharge <b>stormwater</b> into the stream.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} iron ore {{quarries}} occur along Stafford Meadow Creek downstream of Lake Scranton. In southern Scranton, the stream flows through old residential neighborhoods. Interstate 380 passes near {{the headwaters of}} Stafford Meadow Brook. Interstate 81 {{is also in the}} stream's watershed, as is Pennsylvania Route 307 and Pittston Avenue. In 2013, it was estimated that there were four <b>stormwater</b> detention facilities in one reach of the watershed.|$|E
5|$|In the U.S., {{airports}} {{are required to}} obtain <b>stormwater</b> discharge permits and ensure that wastes from deicing operations are properly collected and treated. Large new airports {{may be required to}} collect 60 percent of aircraft deicing fluid after deicing. Airports that discharge the collected aircraft deicing fluid directly to waters of the U.S. must also meet numeric discharge requirements for chemical oxygen demand. A report in 2000 stated that ethylene glycol was becoming less popular for aircraft deicing in the U.S., due to its reporting requirements and adverse environmental impacts (p.213), and noted a shift to the use of propylene glycol (p.I-3).|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1970s, studies {{indicated}} that active treatment {{would be the}} most suitable remedy for abandoned mine drainage in the watershed of Nanticoke Creek, with hydrated lime being proposed as one possible treatment method. However, some small scale passive treatment has been attempted in the watershed. A 2008 paper estimated that the Nanticoke Creek Assessment and Restoration Project would cost $5,000,000. An active treatment project by the Earth Conservancy began in 2012, with the intent to repair damage caused by the Askam Borehole. The Bureau of Abandoned Mine Reclamation of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has a permit to discharge <b>stormwater</b> into the creek during earth-moving activities involving filling in dangerous strip pits.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{the risk}} of sinkholes {{occurring}} in Guatemala City is high and unpredictable. One recent, similar sinkhole had collapsed in 2007, forming a pit 100 metres deep. The 2007 Guatemala City sinkhole was formed by fluid from a sewer eroding uncemented volcanic ash, limestone, and other pyroclastic deposits underlying Guatemala City. The hazards around the pipe have since then been mitigated, by improved handling of the city's wastewater and runoff. Several rainstorms {{also contributed to the}} sinkhole's collapse, as <b>stormwater</b> percolated into the ground, further dissolving the rocks beneath Guatemala City. The 2010 sinkhole was formed for similar reasons.|$|E
5|$|Some {{reaches of}} Keyser Creek {{experience}} total flow loss {{and there is}} no regular flow in the watershed's lower reaches. There are also extensive piles of culm and silts piled up in the creek's floodplain, left over from the coal mining era. There is at least one sanitary sewer overflow in the watershed. As of 2013, there are an estimated four <b>stormwater</b> detention facilities in the watershed. The creek has no perennial flow, since it loses flow to mine pools during dry weather. For this reason, it is unlikely to attain its designated uses. However, it still has flow during storms. During storm flows, the creek carries large amounts of sediment containing coal waste. Additionally, there are some discharges of rusty water into the creek, in addition to a combined sewer overflow.|$|E
5|$|The Everglades Forever Act, {{introduced}} by Governor Lawton Chiles in 1994, {{was an attempt}} to legislate the lowering of phosphorus in Everglades waterways. The act put the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) in charge of testing and enforcing low phosphorus levels: 10parts per billion (ppb) (down from 500ppb in the 1980s). The SFWMD built <b>Stormwater</b> Treatment Areas (STAs) near sugarcane fields where water leaving the EAA flows into ponds lined with lime rock and layers of peat and calcareous periphyton. Testing has shown this method to be more effective than previously anticipated, bringing levels from 80ppb to 10ppb.|$|E
5|$|There is {{significant}} <b>stormwater</b> flow and sedimentation in Mahoning Creek, {{as well as}} agricultural and urban runoff. However, the creek is less environmentally damaged than the nearby Chillisquaque Creek. Mahoning Creek is considered by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to be impaired downstream of Kase Run, part of which is also impaired. Additionally, the tributary Mauses Creek {{is considered to be}} impaired, as are {{the upper reaches of the}} tributary Sechler Run. The cause of the impairment of Mahoning Creek is siltation and the source is agriculture and urban runoff/storm sewers. Sections of all three of its named tributaries are impaired, with the cause being siltation and the source being agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Westchester's postwar {{development}} {{led to more}} <b>stormwater</b> runoff, {{which often}} flooded and closed the parkway. By 1958, engineers were urging that the river be cleaned up to reduce flooding. Still, illegal dumping and overflows continued. For example, storm runoff gave the Yonkers section the river's highest concentrations of heavy metals, PCBs, and other chemicals, {{according to a study}} of the river in 1983, the year the city stopped using the Saw Mill as its primary water source. A decade later, the sediment in the Saw Mill had the highest concentration of metals in the United States Geological Survey's entire water-quality assessment program.|$|E
5|$|Where {{it passes}} through Bristol the river was prone to flooding, but the Northern <b>Stormwater</b> Interceptor, running from Eastville Sluices to the River Avon {{downstream}} of Clifton Suspension Bridge, has since been constructed to control this. At Wade Street, St Judes, the river enters an underground culvert, emerging at what Bristolians call The Centre (formerly the 'Tramways Centre'), but only {{when there is a}} risk of flooding. The river is otherwise channelled through Mylne's Culvert into the River Avon at a point between Bathurst Basin and Gaol Ferry Bridge. Three further flood relief tunnels- Castle Ditch, Fosseway and Castle Green Tunnel - run under Castle Park in central Bristol to carry excess flows into the Floating Harbour.|$|E
5|$|In March 2004 Kelly {{performed}} across North America, including New York, Boston, Chicago, Seattle, and Los Angeles. This {{was followed}} by a more extensive series of shows between July and September throughout North America and Europe. In December, in Melbourne, Kelly performed 100 of his songs in alphabetical order over two nights. A similar set of shows were performed in a studio at Sydney Opera House in December 2006, these and similar sets became known as his A to Z shows. Foggy Highway was a second bluegrass-oriented album for Kelly, credited to Paul Kelly and the <b>Stormwater</b> Boys and issued in 2005. It peaked at No.23 on the ARIA albums charts. The line-up {{for the majority of the}} tracks was Kelly, Mick Albeck (fiddle), James Gillard (bass guitar), Rod McCormack (guitar), Ian Simpson (banjo), and Trev Warner (mandolin). As with Smoke (his previous bluegrass release), Foggy Highway consisted of a mix of new compositions and rearranged Kelly classics. The Canadian edition of the release included a four-song bonus EP of out-takes.|$|E
5|$|Spring Brook {{experiences}} noticeable flow loss. As of 2009, it {{has high}} levels of sodium and alkalinity. Pittson Township and the borough of Moosic have permits to discharge <b>stormwater</b> into it. However, the water quality and habitat quality of the stream are relatively unimpacted. The stream has relatively high water quality even where it flows through a concrete channel. In {{a study by the}} Susquehanna River Basin Commission, it was found not to fail any water quality standards either during base flow or storm flow conditions. However, a study from the previous year found concentrations of sodium and alkalinity exceeding the threshold for concern. In the early 1900s, Spring Brook was a clear stream in its upper reaches. However, by the time it reached the property of the Du Pont Powder Company, it was affected by slush pumped into it by the Pennsylvania Coal Company.|$|E
5|$|The Restudy {{came with}} a plan to stop the declining {{environmental}} quality, and this proposal was to be the most expensive and comprehensive ecological repair project in history. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) proposed more than 60construction projects over 30years to store water that was being flushed into the ocean, in reservoirs, underground aquifers, and abandoned quarries; add more <b>Stormwater</b> Treatment Areas to filter water that flowed into the lower Everglades; regulate water released from pumping stations into local waterways and improve water released to Everglades National Park and Water Conservation Areas; remove barriers to sheetflow by raising the Tamiami Trail and destroying the Miami Canal, and reuse wastewater for urban areas. The cost estimate for the entire plan was $7.8billion, and in a bipartisan show of cooperation, CERP was voted through Congress with an overwhelming margin. It was signed by President Bill Clinton on December 11, 2000.|$|E
5|$|The {{municipality}} {{aims for}} a coherent and holistic {{administration of the}} water cycle to protect against or clean up previous pollution and encourage green growth and self-sufficiency. The main issues are excessive nutrients, adapting to increasing levels of precipitation brought on by climate change, and securing the water supply. These goals have manifested {{in a number of}} large water treatment projects often in collaboration with private partners. In the 2000s, underground rainwater basins were built across the city while the two lakes Årslev Engsø and Egå Engsø were created in 2003 and 2006 respectively. The number of sewage treatment plants is planned to be reduced from 17 to 2 by 2025 as the treatment plants in Marselisborg and Egå are scheduled for expansion to take over all waste water treatment. They have already been refitted for biogas production to become net producers of electricity and heat. To aid the new treatment plants, and avoid floodings, sewage and <b>stormwater</b> throughout the municipality is planned to be separated into two different drainage systems. Construction began in 2017 in several areas, but it is a long process and is scheduled to be finished by 2085.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, EPA {{estimated}} that there are over 500,000 <b>stormwater</b> permittees. This number includes permanent facilities such as municipal (POTW, MS4) and industrial plants, and construction sites, which are temporary <b>stormwater</b> dischargers.|$|E
25|$|Litter traps {{can be used}} {{to capture}} litter as it exits <b>stormwater</b> drains into waterways. However, litter traps are only {{effective}} for large or floating items of litter and must be maintained. A recent watershed litter survey showed a difference in the composition of street litter and <b>stormwater</b> litter.|$|E
25|$|Sewage {{may include}} <b>stormwater</b> runoff or urban runoff. Sewerage systems capable of {{handling}} storm water are known as combined sewer systems. This design was common when urban sewerage systems were first developed, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Combined sewers require much larger and more expensive treatment facilities than sanitary sewers. Heavy volumes of storm runoff may overwhelm the sewage treatment system, causing a spill or overflow. Sanitary sewers are typically much smaller than combined sewers, {{and they are not}} designed to transport <b>stormwater.</b> Backups of raw sewage can occur if excessive infiltration/inflow (dilution by <b>stormwater</b> and/or groundwater) is allowed into a sanitary sewer system. Communities that have urbanized in the mid-20th century or later generally have built separate systems for sewage (sanitary sewers) and <b>stormwater,</b> because precipitation causes widely varying flows, reducing sewage treatment plant efficiency.|$|E

25|$|Effective {{control of}} urban runoff {{involves}} reducing the velocity {{and flow of}} <b>stormwater,</b> as well as reducing pollutant discharges. A variety of <b>stormwater</b> management practices and systems {{may be used to}} reduce the effects of urban runoff. Some of these techniques (called best management practices (BMPs) in the US), focus on water quantity control, while others focus on improving water quality, and some perform both functions.|$|E
25|$|Ag Development once {{received}} {{a permit to}} discharge <b>stormwater</b> into Silver Creek for construction purposes.|$|E
25|$|Throughout its history, the Gowanus Canal's sewage {{problems}} have been exacerbated by the effects of <b>stormwater.</b> For years, heavy rains have flooded streets and caused sewage lines to overflow, contributing to the contamination of the Gowanus Canal. Much of the Gowanus canal area is at sea level, in a Zone A risk area for flooding, as residents discovered during Hurricane Sandy. To help prevent flooding, the city is investing in various methods of <b>stormwater</b> management. One related improvement has been the creation of specialized curbside gardens, or bioswales, along sidewalks to absorb <b>stormwater</b> and reduce sewer overflows into the Canal. A community-based non-profit organization, the Gowanus Canal Conservancy, is involved in stewardship of the bioswales.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 2017, the city's Department of Environmental Protection {{started to}} build several miles of {{high-level}} storm sewers to prevent <b>stormwater</b> from flooding the city's sewage system. The new storm sewers will carry <b>stormwater</b> collected {{in new and}} existing catchment areas, preventing it from entering the sewage system. The first phase is planned for completion by 2018, with a second phase proceeding from 2018-2020.|$|E
25|$|Most of the creeks on {{the eastern}} side are tidal {{although}} Swan Alley creek is the outlet for the Dry Creek and the Little Para River, and the North Arm Creek for the Barker Inlet Wetlands. The wetlands were created in 1994 as part of a <b>stormwater</b> treatment system with both tidal and freshwater sections. There is 1.72km2 of constructed wetlands holding 1.2 Gigalitres of <b>stormwater</b> before discharging via the creek.|$|E
