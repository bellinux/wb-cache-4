A continuum robot is designed for troubleshooting of leaks for fuel tank which has strong constraints and is also explosive. The biomimetic robot with several flexible sections applies actuation redundancy through pulling its four independent driving cables to realize bending motion of {{two degrees of freedom}} (DOF). The forward kinematics about the relations of cables lengths, angles and tip coordinates of <b>single</b> <b>section</b> is established using projection curvature method and coordinates transformation method. The decoupled multi-section kinematics function is deduced based on the kinematics analysis of <b>single</b> <b>section.</b> Simulations of <b>single</b> <b>section</b> motion are presented.

5000|$|In 1905 a [...] "state of the art" [...] {{spark gap}} {{transmitter}} generated a signal having a wavelength between 250 meters (1.2 MHz) and 550 meters (545 kHz). 600 meters (500 kHz) became the International distress frequency. The receivers were simple unamplified magnetic detectors or electrolytic detectors. This later {{gave way to}} the famous and more sensitive galena crystal sets. Tuners were primitive or nonexistent. Early amateur radio operators built low power spark gap transmitters using the spark coil from Ford Model T automobiles. But a typical commercial station in 1916 might include a 1/2 kW transformer that supplied 14,000 volts, an eight <b>section</b> <b>capacitor,</b> and a rotary gap capable of handling a peak current of several hundred amperes.|$|R
