40|$|To {{make the}} hydro power {{application}} more environmentally adapted new EALs such as synthetic esters {{will replace the}} existing mineral oils. This study aims to exploit the EALs potential in boundary lubrication, especially in slow sliding journal bearings with shaft oscillation as those supporting the Kaplan turbine blades. In order to evaluate the performance of different lubricated environmentally adapted journal bearings a test rig was built. Many test rig parameters were set to simulate water turbine conditions. Tests were performed with different bearing and shaft materials and different lubricants suited for water turbine application, EALs, water with and the present used mineral oil reference. Additional lubricated tests in oscillating motion were conducted with a roller on disc and a pin on disc. All tests were performed with oscillating motion. The results showed that synthetic esters affect the contact material to a larger extent than the tested mineral oil. The synthetic esters were also sensitive to the selection of bearing and shaft material. Highly alloyed bronzes were more prone to corrosive wear. A coated shaft showed excellent performance with a low alloyed tin bronze. The comparison of <b>self</b> <b>lubricated</b> bearings with water lubrication to an EAL lubricated tin bronze on stainless steel showed large performance differences between the water lubricated materials. They showed both better and worse friction and wear results than the EAL lubricated tin bronze. The oscillating pin on disc can generate similar contact mechanisms as in a journal bearing. The most important conclusion of this work {{is that it is}} possible to find <b>self</b> <b>lubricated</b> journal bearings better suited for shaft oscillation than EAL lubricated bronze bearings in water turbine application. Water lubricated design of the bearings are the most environmentally adapted solution. EALs such as the tested synthetic esters have a promising future in the hydraulic systems controlling the turbines and can under certain boundary lubrication conditions with bronze show excellent performance.

40|$|In recent years, surface {{engineering}} techniques {{have been developed}} {{in order to improve}} the tribological performance in many industrial applications. In sheet metal forming processes, the usage of liquid lubricants can be decreased by using <b>self</b> <b>lubricated</b> tribo surfaces which will result in more environmentally friendly workshops. In the present work two different concepts, i. e. the deposition of thin organic coatings on the steel sheet and PVD coatings on the tool, have been evaluated. The sheet materials investigated include Zn and 55 %Al-Zn metal coated steel sheet, which in general are difficult materials to form under dry conditions since they are sticky and thus have a high tendency to adhere to the tool surface. The PVD coatings include CrN, TiN and various DLC coatings. The work comprises tribo testing and post test characterisation using surface analytical techniques in order to evaluate the tribological properties of the tribo surfaces. The tribological tests of different tribo couples were conducted by using modified scratch testing and ball-on-disc testing. From these test results different friction and wear mechanisms have been identified. The deposition of thin organic coatings on the steel sheet metal {{has been found to be}} promising in order to control the friction and to avoid metal-metal contact resulting in galling. However, it has been found that the tribological characteristics of organic coated steel sheet are strongly influenced by coating chemical composition, the substrate surface topography and the coating thickness distribution. The performance of the PVD coatings depends mainly on the chemical composition and topography of the coated surface. By choosing PVD coatings such as diamond like carbon (DLC) low and stable friction coefficients can be obtained in sliding contact against Zn. Surface irregularities such as droplet-like asperities may cause an initial high friction coefficient. However, after a running in process or by polishing the PVD coating low friction coefficients can be obtained resulting in a stable sliding contact. The combination of imaging (optical profilometry, LOM, SEM) and chemical analytical techniques (EDS, AES, ToF-SIMS) gave valuable information concerning the friction and wear properties of the tribo surfaces investigated...|$|R
50|$|In all gliding {{bearings}} wear is {{an issue}} of concern, as well as lubrication. Conventional gliding yaw bearings incorporate gliding elements manufactured out of polymer plastics such as POM or PA. To reduce friction, wear, and avoid stick-slip effects (often present in such high friction slow moving systems), lubrication is often introduced. This solution generally solves the gliding issues, but introduces more components to the systems and increases the general complication (e.g., difficult maintenance procedures for removal of used lubricant). Some wind turbine manufacturers now use <b>self</b> <b>lubricating</b> gliding elements instead of a central lubrication system. These gliding elements are manufactured from low friction materials or composites (e.t.g Teflon) that allow reliable operation of dry (non-lubricated) gliding yaw systems.|$|E
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} jack uses a liquid, which is incompressible, that is {{forced into a}} cylinder by a pump plunger. Oil is used since it is <b>self</b> <b>lubricating</b> and stable. When the plunger pulls back, it draws oil out of the reservoir through a suction check valve into the pump chamber. When the plunger moves forward, it pushes the oil through a discharge check valve into the cylinder. The suction valve ball is within the chamber and opens with each draw of the plunger. The discharge valve ball is outside the chamber and opens when the oil is pushed into the cylinder. At this point the suction ball within the chamber is forced shut and oil pressure builds in the cylinder.|$|E

40|$|The plasma {{transferred}} arc (PTA) {{technique was}} used to produce composite coatings based on co-melting of MoS 2, TiC and iron ingredients, {{in an attempt to}} obtain wear resistant layers with <b>self</b> <b>lubricating</b> properties. As a matter of fact, both molybdenum and titanium are known to form with sulfur either crystalline or amorphous compounds exhibiting special <b>self</b> <b>lubricating</b> properties. In this perspective three coatings containing the same quantity of TiC and increasing MoS 2 contents were produced using plain carbon steel material as the substrate. Three other coatings containing only increasing contents of MoS 2 without TiC were prepared under the same conditions for comparison. The experiments have shown that both TiC and MoS 2 ingredients dissolve completely in the melt under the plasma arc. whereas their elements, Ti, C and S, are redistributed in the solidification products forming new compounds. The influence of the presence of sulfur in the solidification path of the Fe-Ti(Mo) -C system is studied. Although the original MoS 2 compound is totally absent in the final microstructure, the composites containing both MoS 2 and TiC have formed new complex sulfides, presumably endowed with <b>self</b> <b>lubricating</b> properties. As a result, the wear tests performed with a pin-on-disk apparatus have shown that the coatings which were produced using both TiC and MoS 2 ingredients exhibited improved friction coefficients and lower wear rates in comparison to the steel substrate {{as well as to the}} composite containing TiC, but exempted from MoS 2.

Al 203 pins were slid against PS 300 coated superalloy disks in air, under a 4. 9 N load at velocities of 1 to 8 m/s.
