5000|$|A {{more modern}} {{classification}} ranks these groups as separate divisions (sometimes under the <b>Superdivision</b> Spermatophyta): ...|$|E
50|$|The kingdom {{indicated}} {{this species}} is a plant. The subkingdom implies that this species is a vascular plant: It has {{a system of}} tissues (roots, leaves, and stems) allowing food and water to travel. The <b>superdivision</b> is the classification for seed plants, and the division categorizes the capa rose as a flowering plant. The class indicates the species to be a dicotyledon. The embryo inside each seed produces leaves, or cotyledons, when germinated. This species produces two leaves, thus dicotyledon. The most common characteristic of the subclass of this species is the tight cluster of individual flowers, showing the appearance of one larger flower. The order indicates that the capa rose has opposite, or pairs of symmetrical, leaves. The family is almost all tropical plants with clustered flowers, most native to the western hemisphere. The genus classifies this flower as a beautyberry.|$|E
50|$|Carex rosea {{consist of}} four {{different}} species 7. Most {{of them are}} found mainly in Canada. While some characters seem to be unreliable for the separation of each species, other characters, like {{the width of the}} broadest leaves, the shape of the perigynium base, and the fertile culms, are reliable. Different analysis of the mixed populations have concluded that hybridization between the species does not occur. The Kingdom of Carex roseae is plantae.The rank of Carex rosea consists of the following, the subkingdom is tracheobionta, which means that {{it is part of the}} vascular plants. The <b>superdivision</b> of Carex rosea is spermatophyta, also known as seed plants. The division of this plant is magnoliophyta, which is flowering plants. This plant belongs to the class called liliopsida. The subclass of Carex rosea is commelinidae, and finally the order is Cyperales. Carex is a genus of grasslike herbs that are widely distributed and distinguished having the seedlike achenes enclosed in a sac in the axil of a bract. According to results from a complete ITS sequence based phylogeny, Carex rosea is sister to Carex radiata, Carex retroflexa, Carex texensis, and Carex socialis. This plant is primarily confused with Carex radiata. Typically Carex rosea occurs in drier sites and has slightly narrower leaves.|$|E
2500|$|A {{controversial}} figure widely {{associated with}} GM's decline, Smith's tenure is commonly {{viewed as a}} failure, as GM's share of the US market fell from 46% to 35% and the company lapsed close to bankruptcy during the early 1990s recession. Consequently, CNBC has called Smith one of the [...] "Worst American CEOs of All Time," [...] stating, [...] "Smith...had the right idea but may have lacked the intuition to understand how his rip-up-the-carpet redo would affect the delicate web of informal communication that GM relied upon." [...] In 2013, he was included on Fortunes list of the [...] "10 Worst Auto Chiefs," [...] with writer Alex Taylor III stating, [...] "He wasted billions trying to revive the sagging giant through diversification (EDS and Hughes), automation (robotized factories), reorganization (two <b>superdivisions</b> B-O-C and C-P-C), commonization (GM-10 cars) and experimentation (Saturn). Smith's legacy was a fleet of low-quality, lookalike autos, an unqualified successor, and a mountain of debt that pushed the company close to bankruptcy in 1992." [...] Smith and his legacy remain subjects of considerable interest and debate among automotive writers and historians.|$|R
