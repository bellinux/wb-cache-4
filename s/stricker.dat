He added that he was planning to reduce his performance commitments from 100 dates per year to about 30, and that he thought that his experience in the entertainment business would be an asset to potential clients. Rucker will be able to work without restrictions for golfers, but because he is not registered with the NFL players' union, he initially will only be able to meet with NFL players under very limited circumstances.|$|E
25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the American Revolutionary War one of his neighbors, John Philip De Haas became commander of the 1st Pennsylvania Battalion. Haussegger joined the Continental Army and became a major in the 4th Pennsylvania Battalion on 4 January 1776. Meanwhile, on 25 May the Continental Congress began recruiting the German Battalion from ethnic Germans in Pennsylvania and Maryland. Later, Haussegger was appointed colonel in command while Marylanders George <b>Stricker</b> and Ludowick Weltner became lieutenant colonel and major, respectively. His commission dated from 17 July 1776. However, he only found out about his appointment in August while campaigning in the north and did not assume command of his battalion until October.|$|E

40|$|<b>Stricker's</b> theorem {{states that}} a Gaussian {{process is a}} semimartingale in its natural {{filtration}} {{if and only if}} it is the sum of an independent increment Gaussian process and a Gaussian process of finite variation, see [1983, Z. Wahrsch. Verw. Gebiete 64 (3) ]. We consider extensions of this result to non Gaussian infinitely divisible processes. First we show that the class of infinitely divisible semimartingales is so large that the natural analog of <b>Stricker's</b> theorem fails to hold. Then, as the main result, we prove that an infinitely divisible semimartingale relative to the filtration generated by a random measure admits a unique decomposition into an independent increment process and an infinitely divisible process of finite variation. Consequently, the natural analog of <b>Stricker's</b> theorem holds for all strictly representable processes (as defined in this paper). Since Gaussian processes are strictly representable due to Hida's multiplicity theorem, the classical <b>Stricker's</b> theorem follows from our result. Another consequence is that the question when an infinitely divisible process is a semimartingale can often be reduced to a path property, when a certain associated infinitely divisible process is of finite variation. This gives the key to characterize the semimartingale property for many processes of interest. Along these lines, we characterize semimartingales within a large class of stationary increment infinitely divisible processes; this class includes many infinitely divisible processes, including linear fractional processes, mixed moving averages, and supOU processes, as particular cases. The proof of the main theorem relies on series representations of jumps of cadlag infinitely divisible processes given in Basse-O'Connor and Rosinski [2013, Ann. Probab. 41 (6) ] combined with techniques of stochastic analysis.

25|$|Dubbed “Millionaire’s Row,” {{the portion}} of <b>Stricker</b> Street facing the Square {{featured}} the Italianate residences of bankers, investors, and factory owners. Other variations of the Italianate style lined the blocks leading up to and surrounding the square. Less ornate homes were put up in groups on side and alley streets, but all shared many identical features such as cornices, marble steps, and iron work. Developers and homeowners attempted to build the most economic dwellings possible, so they crammed narrow rowhouses along every road, avenue and alley in the district. Common brick was often used on side walls, with hard surface English brick on the front. The largest rooms were typically the front parlors and master bedrooms – smaller rooms were placed to the rear.|$|E
25|$|The two-and-one-half {{acres for}} the park was {{approved}} for that use and donated by the Donnells in 1847. The park is one block square, bordered by Lombard, <b>Stricker,</b> Gilmor, and Hollins streets. The landscape of Union Square – with its walkways, pavilion, fountain, and wrought iron lamps – recalls Victorian Era Baltimore. Architect John F. Hoss designed the iron Greek-style pavilion with fluted columns in 1850 – it covers a natural spring that was once accessible by steps and, at one time, supplied water to the B Railroad. The source of the name “Union Square” is uncertain but probably reflects the patriotic sentiment of this time before the Civil War. Fog scenes of the Square, lights agleam over wet pavements and barren limbs, were often featured in local landscape artistry.|$|E
25|$|Calm {{and sunny}} weather {{provided}} good scoring {{conditions for the}} opening round. Miguel Ángel Jiménez took the lead at 64 (−6), and past champions turned back the clock: five-time winner Tom Watson, age 59, carded a bogey-free 65, and both Mark Calcavecchia (1989, age 49) and Mark O'Meara (1998, 52) shot 67. Ben Curtis, 2003 champion, also opened with 65 to join Watson and Kenichi Kuboya, who was even par through 14 holes, but finished birdie, birdie, eagle, birdie. Steve <b>Stricker,</b> Stewart Cink, and Camilo Villegas started strong at 66, and notables at 67 included Calcavecchia, O'Meara, Retief Goosen, Jim Furyk, Mike Weir, and Vijay Singh. Two-time defending champion Pádraig Harrington had a quiet 69, while Tiger Woods struggled off the tee for 71. Two-time champion Greg Norman, the previous year's Cinderella story, had a disappointing 77.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the mortal}} {{shooting}} of Ross, the British under Colonel Arthur Brooke advanced through the Bouldin family farm {{to attack the}} American line anchored at the junction of North Point Road and Trappe Road. General <b>Stricker's</b> line consisted of the 27th, 5th, 39th and 51st regiments of Maryland Militia, supplemented with a company from Hagerstown and several companies of troops from Pennsylvania. The Battle of North Point lasted for several hours during the afternoon. Brooke sent his 4th Regiment of Foot in a flanking maneuver to unsettle the American left, which led to <b>Stricker's</b> 51st regiment and elements of the 39th regiment to retreat in some disorder. The remainder of the Americans traded volleys with the invaders until they eventually retreated in good order when their ammunition began to become low.|$|R
50|$|Little {{is known}} of <b>Stricker's</b> youth and {{personal}} life.The fact that he published a volume of Italian cantatas might indicate that, like most aspiring composers of the era, he probably spent considerable time studying in Italy.

25|$|An 18-month U.S. tour, {{starring}} Michael York as Arthur, Rachel York (no relation) as Guenevere, and James Barbour as Lancelot, {{began on}} January 9, 2007 {{and ended in}} April 2008. Alan Jay Lerner's son, Michael Lerner, contributed changes to the libretto, and Glenn Casale directed. From June 27–30, 2007, the tour played at Toronto's Hummingbird Centre, where the musical had premiered in 1960. While the 2007 Michael York tour was performing across the U.S., Candlewood International ran a separate, largely non-equity national tour that played to cities not visited by the union tour. The Morgan Le Fey character was removed {{as it had been}} in all previous productions since 1964. Jeff Buchsbaum directed and Paula Sloan choreographed a cast headed by Robert Brown as Arthur, Matthew Posner as Lancelot, Mollie Vogt-Welch as Guenevere, Gregory Van Acker as Sir Sagramore, Geoff Lutz as Mordred, and Heather Faith <b>Stricker</b> as Lady Catherine.|$|E
25|$|Woods's {{inconsistent}} {{play in the}} 2010 FedEx Cup playoffs {{failed to}} qualify him into the top 30 players for The Tour Championship, {{for the first time}} since he turned professional in 1996. He had won the FedEx Cup in 2007 and 2009. He also failed to qualify on points for the 2010 Ryder Cup team, for the first time in his career. But captain Corey Pavin chose Woods as one of his four captain's picks. Woods, again partnering with Steve <b>Stricker</b> in pairs play, played inconsistently in terrible weather conditions at Celtic Manor in Wales; the matches were delayed several times when the course became unplayable, and the format had to be significantly modified and then even extended to a fourth day to complete the event. The U.S., entering as Cup holders, lost the Cup to the European team, by the narrowest possible margin, 14.5 to 13.5. However, Woods played impressive golf in his final-day singles match, winning decisively over Francesco Molinari.|$|E
25|$|Woods {{earned his}} 60th PGA Tour {{victory at the}} BMW Championship by {{shooting}} a course record 63 {{in the final round}} to win by two strokes. He sank a fifty-foot putt in the final round and missed only two fairways on the weekend. He led the field in most birdies for the tournament, and ranked in the top five in driving accuracy, driving distance, putts per round, putts per green, and greens in regulation. Woods finished his 2007 season with a runaway victory at the Tour Championship to capture his fourth title in his last five starts of the year. He became the only two-time winner of the event, and the champion of the inaugural FedEx Cup. In his 16 starts on Tour in 2007, his adjusted scoring average was 67.79, matching his own record set in 2000. His substantial leads over the second, third, and fourth players were similar in 2000 (1.46 (Phil Mickelson), 1.52 (Ernie Els), 1.66 (David Duval)) and 2007 (1.50 (Els), 1.51 (Justin Rose), 1.60 (Steve <b>Stricker)).</b>|$|E
