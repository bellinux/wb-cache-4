25|$|Dropping dilute acid (often 10% HCl) aids in {{distinguishing}} carbonates {{from other}} mineral classes. The acid reacts with the carbonate (2−) group, which causes {{the affected area}} to effervesce, giving off carbon dioxide gas. This test can be further expanded to test the mineral in its original crystal form or powdered. An example of this test is done when distinguish calcite from dolomite, especially within rocks (limestone and dolostone respectively). Calcite immediately effervesces in acid, whereas acid must be applied to powdered dolomite (often to a <b>scratched</b> <b>surface</b> in a rock), for it to effervesce. Zeolite minerals will not effervesce in acid; instead, they become frosted after 5–10 minutes, and if left in acid for a day, they dissolve or become a silica gel.|$|E
6000|$|In urging my raft {{along the}} shore line {{of one of the}} {{stagnant}} lagoons one day I was surprised to find a broad rock jutting out from the shore, its upper surface some ten coprets above the water. Disembarking, I ascended it, and on examination recognized it as the remnant of an immense mountain which at one time must have been 5,000 coprets in height and doubtless the dominating peak of a long range. From the striations all over it I discovered that it had been worn away to its present trivial size by glacial action. Opening my case of instruments, I took out my petrochronologue and applied it to the worn and <b>scratched</b> <b>surface</b> of the rock. The indicator at once pointed to K 59 xpc ½! At this astonishing result I was nearly overcome by excitement: the last erosions of the ice-masses upon this vestige of a stupendous mountain range which they had worn away, had been made as recently as the year 1945! Hastily applying my nymograph, I found that the name of this particular mountain at the time when it began to be enveloped in the mass of ice moving down upon it from the north, was [...] "Pike's Peak." [...] Other observations with other instruments showed that at that time the country circumjacent to it had been inhabited by a partly civilized race of people known as Galoots, the name of their capital city being Denver.|$|E

5000|$|Handling - Some {{coatings}} {{are more}} durable than others. A scratch through an anti-reflective coating is also much more visible than a scratch {{through the surface}} of an uncoated glass due to {{the difference in the}} reflectivity of the <b>scratched</b> <b>surface</b> (glass ~8%) and the reflectivity of the anti-reflective surface around the scratch (~0.5%). Therefore, anti-reflective coatings with more scratch-resistance are preferred in art glazing. Magnetron-sputtered and sol-gel anti-reflective coatings are typically metal oxides with superior hardness compared to other application methods.|$|E

One face of a silicon crystal was given periodic microscratches (grooves) {{by means of a}} diamond blade. The x-ray tests of the crystal deformation due to a given periodic pattern of surface scratches have shown that a sinusoidal-like shape is observed on both the <b>scratched</b> <b>surface</b> and the opposite (unscratched) face of the crystal; that is, a periodic sinusoidal-like deformation goes through the bulk of the crystal.

Despite the constant average roughness, skewness and kurtosis parameters have been changed considerably during the thermal oxidation. The results suggest that the valleys are preferred sites for nucleation and growth of oxides. This mechanism changes the surface morphology from a <b>scratched</b> <b>surface</b> to a bumpy one.

30|$|In this article, surface {{scratches}} on finished KDP surface were artificially generated and characterized with nano-indenter and {{atomic force microscope}} (AFM), respectively. The scratches {{were characterized}} with varied depth, directions and shapes. The morphology of scratches in different directions is quite different resulting from anisotropy of KDP crystals. The <b>scratched</b> <b>surface</b> along with surfaces free of scratches were irradiated with a 355  nm pulsed laser to acquire the damage threshold of KDP. The testing results show that scratches can reduce the LIDT of KDP surface by > 30 %. Comparing the LIDTs of scratches in different depth, directions and shapes, no significant difference is observed, however. In addition, the experimental phenomena are interpreted by modelling the light field around the scratches with 2 -D FDTD.|$|E

40|$|The surface {{characteristics}} and removal mechanism of cemented tungsten carbide materials with different grain sizes in nanoscratching were investigated. The tests with different scratching patterns were used. The {{results showed that}} the fine-grain material exhibited different removal characteristics from the coarse-grain one. The roughness of the <b>scratched</b> <b>surface</b> on the fine-grain material was much smaller than that on the coarse-grain material. The removal rate of the coarse-grain material associated with the nanoscratching process was much greater than that of the fine-grain material. The microstructure of the two materials apparently affected their deformation and removal mechanisms involved in the nanoscratching, thus the surface roughness and the removal rate. The results obtained from the lapping experiment supported the findings from the nanoscratching test. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{deformation}} of monocrystalline silicon (Si) under nanoscratching was investigated using {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM). The results indicated that no fracture occurred during nanoscratching with loads ranging from 1 to 6 mN. The damaged regions induced by nanoscratching included an amorphous Si region and a damaged crystalline Si region. Detailed TEM analyses revealed that at the lowest load of I mN no dislocation was observed in the damaged crystalline region, and only stacking faults were observed at {{the boundary between the}} damaged crystalline Si and amorphous Si. Dislocations started to nucleate along (111) planes and penetrated into the bulk Si when the normal load was increased to 2 mN and above. Defects perpendicular to the <b>scratched</b> <b>surface</b> were initiated when the load was greater than 4 mN. The density of dislocations also increased rapidly with the increase of the applied load...|$|E
