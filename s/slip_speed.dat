50|$|Eddy current drives are slip-controlled systems {{the slip}} energy {{of which is}} {{necessarily}} all dissipated as heat. Such drives are therefore generally less efficient than AC/DC-AC conversion based drives. The motor develops the torque required by the load and operates at full speed. The output shaft transmits the same torque to the load, but turns at a slower speed. Since power is proportional to torque multiplied by speed, the input power is proportional to motor speed times operating torque while the output power is output speed times operating torque.

The considered clutch is particularly based on the modulated field principle and has two shafts with speed ratio of 1. 14 at synchronous conditions.

40|$|Subduction megathrust <b>slip</b> <b>speeds</b> {{range from}} slow creep at plate {{convergence}} rates (centimetres per year) to seismic slip rates (metres per second) {{in the largest}} earthquakes on Earth. The deformation mechanisms controlling whether fast slip or slow creep occurs, however, remain unclear. Here, we present evidence that pressure solution creep (fluid-assisted stress driven mass transfer) is an important deformation mechanism in megathrust faults. We quantify megathrust strength using a laboratory-constrained microphysical model for fault friction, involving viscous pressure solution and frictional sliding. We find that at plate-boundary deformation rates, aseismic, frictional–viscous flow is the preferred deformation mechanism at temperatures above 100 [*]°C. The model thus predicts aseismic creep at temperatures much cooler than the onset of crystal plasticity, unless a boundary condition changes. Within this model framework, earthquakes may nucleate when a local increase in strain rate triggers velocity-weakening slip, and we speculate that slip area and event magnitude increase with increasing spacing of strong, topographically derived irregularities in the subduction interface...|$|R

40|$|Dry dual {{clutches}} {{are widely}} used in automated manual transmissions. In such systems the clutch engagement maneuvers require a precise knowledge of the characteristics that relate the frictional torque transmitted by the clutches with the corresponding actuators variables. In this paper a temperature and <b>slip</b> <b>speed</b> dependent model of the torque characteristic for dry dual clutches is proposed. Dynamic models of the temperature evolution are determined and linked to {{the characteristics of the}} mechanical components influencing the torque. The models, whose parameters are tuned with dedicated experiments and realistic data coming from an industrial automotive environment, show the temperature influence on the torque transmitted by the clutch. Real time simulation results, obtained through a detailed software in the loop driveline model, showthat, if not compensated, the temperature variation can determine critical degradations of the clutch engagement performances. It is shown how the use of the clutch temperature estimation in the torque transmissibility model allows to compensate for such negative effects.

40|$|Automated manual {{transmissions}} {{based on}} dry clutch are wide spreading in modern automotive transmissions {{because of the}} possible improvements in performance and comfort with respect to manual transmissions. A key issue for an efficient control of electro-actuated dry clutch transmissions is {{the knowledge of the}} clutch torque transmitted during the engagement. The torque transmitted by the clutch can be directly measured by means of setups which are difficult to be implemented in commercial products. Therefore it is fundamental to define an accurate torque transmissibility model to be exploited for the estimation of the clutch torque. A possible estimator is based on the inversion of the driveline dynamic model like showed by Gliemo et al. (2006) and by Amari et al. (2009), but the robustness of this type of estimation drastically depends on the availability of the system parameters and on clutch disk acceleration and engine torque measurements. As proposed by Vasca et al. (2008), a possible alternative consists in using an analytical model describing the friction phenomena and providing the torque transmitted by the clutch starting from the throwout bearing position. Unfortunately, the nominal characteristic (torque vs position) is influenced by several variables. Some of them, such as friction pads wear and diaphragm spring fatigue, have a “long term” effect, like showed by Mauro et al. (2002). Other variables have a direct influence also on each engagement maneuver. These variables, such as <b>slipping</b> <b>speed,</b> pressure, <b>slipping</b> acceleration and temperature affect the friction coefficient, as tested by Senatore et al. (2011), Feng et al. (2010) and by LuK (1996), and the normal force (D’Agostino et al., 2012) (Cappetti et al., 2012). The difficulties in representing the contributions of the different variables in the clutch torque transmissibility characteristic lead to the definition of corresponding lumped models, so as in the works of Myklebust et al. (2012; 2013). In this paper a temperature dependent torque transmissibility model for dry clutch transmissions is proposed. The model estimates the clutch torque by considering separately the influence of the <b>slipping</b> <b>speed</b> and temperature on the friction coefficient and the influence of the temperature on the normal force determined by the flat spring. In order to estimate the temperatures of interest, two thermal models of a dry dual clutch transmission with a central disk are proposed. The temperatures estimated by means of the proposed thermal models are then used for the analysis of open loop and closed loop operating conditions in a realistic dry dual clutch transmission...|$|R
