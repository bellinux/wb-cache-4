50|$|A Writing Fellow or Fellow in Writing is a tutor or {{consultant}} who assists with {{college and university}} writing instruction in specific courses or academic fields.

50|$|The College of Wooster {{also has}} an Independent Study program, in which all {{students}} work one-on-one with a faculty advisor to complete a written thesis or other significant project {{during the course of}} the senior year, usually about 50 to 100 pages in length. The student also presents an oral defense of the thesis before a faculty committee. The program, begun in 1947 by Howard Lowry (the college's 7th President), has received attention from other colleges and universities, and a number of other institutions have modeled programs after it. In 2003, the independent study program at Wooster was recognized by US News and World Report as the second best 'senior capstone experience' in the US, behind only Princeton University. Wooster ranks 14th in the United States among independent colleges whose graduates earned Ph.D.s between 1920 and 1995 (according to the Baccalaureate Origins of Doctorate Recipients, 1998). Preparation and completion of the thesis can be time consuming, and led to one view in which a <b>student,</b> <b>writing</b> <b>in</b> the weekly The Wooster Voice, suggested that the independent study program be interwoven with career planning as well as applications to graduate schools.|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the essays {{produced}} by students in two different disciplines, geography and history of science, to examine how far their writing may {{be affected by the}} nature of their previous disciplinary study. In particular, it considers the students' use of Theme, as a feature that is susceptible to discipline-specific variation. The paper questions a view of learning to write within a discipline as a simple unidirectional process. Our research suggests, firstly, that student writing demonstrates at least some disciplinary variation, such that what is valued in one context cannot be assumed to be valued equally in another context, and secondly, that students' success in writing within one disciplinary area may be affected by what they may have learned about writing through previous academic study. These results highlight the need for further cross-disciplinary research into <b>student</b> <b>writing,</b> <b>in</b> order to disentangle both the features that characterize good <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> <b>in</b> different disciplines (which are not necessarily the same as in professional academic writing), and the way that different influences, from a range of previous experiences, combine to shape a student's writing in any particular context.

40|$|Contrastive rhetoric {{has been}} studied since the 1960 s, but its {{significance}} in the practice and pedagogy of teaching academic English is now {{more important than ever}} due to the expansion of English Medium Instruction. As Kaplan (1966) noted, L 2 students’ research papers can often seem “out of focus” because they are employing a rhetoric and sequence of thought which “violate the expectations of the native reader” (p. 13). Exploring this cultural impact on university-level <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> <b>in</b> English is the focus of a joint research project between Tsinghua University, Hong Kong Polytechnic University and Cambridge University supported by the Tsinghua University Initiative Scientific Research Programme. Using corpora of Chinese L 1 <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> <b>in</b> English, research conducted by Tsinghua and Hong Kong PolyU shows that linking words or connectives are a rhetorical problem for Chinese L 1 students due to a misunderstanding and improper presentation of logico-semantic relations between discourse units.

40|$|Recognizing the {{importance}} of <b>student</b> journal <b>writing</b> for language exploration and experimentation, this project examined the impact of introducing student/teacher dialogues {{as part of the}} journal format for kindergartners.

The teacher's role was to discuss each <b>student's</b> <b>writing</b> with him or her at least once a week, rarely <b>writing</b> <b>in</b> their journals. Occasionally, the teacher would make entries in her own journal. Concerns about lack of progress in fluency and diversity <b>in</b> children's <b>writing</b> led the teacher to interview a random sample of nine students about their attitudes toward journal writing. Findings revealed that students were very positive about journal writing. Teacher/student journal dialogues were initiated. Weekly conferences with students continued, and anecdotal records were made of student participation. Journal entries made prior to and after the introduction of dialogues were compared. The results indicated that, in comparison to the previous format, when dialogues were part of the format <b>students</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>in</b> their journals for a longer time, covered more paper with their writing, explored a wider variety of writing forms, and discussed a wider range of topics.

40|$|Literature of {{academic}} writing within the genre theory and English for academic purposes (EAP) reveals that student academic writing is less researched {{compared to the}} research conducted on expert writing (e. g., Swales, 1990, Hyland, 2000). Research on <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> <b>in</b> business studiesseems to be particularly scarce in the literature. Previous studies have only classified academic genres business students produce in the academy (e. g., Canseco & Byrd, 1989, Cooper & Bikowski, 2007) into broader labels such as library research papers, article reviews, business reports, etc. Although this broad labelling is a good step in mapping the type of writing {{students are asked to}} produce in university settings, it seems, however, that we still need more studies that go beyond the mere labelling of the student-produced academic genres and try to investigate the various socio-contextual factors underlying the production of these genres. The present study therefore attempts to go in this direction. In this paper, I will report on results obtained from a qualitative interview-based study on a Master’s level <b>student</b> <b>writing</b> <b>in</b> the Accounting and Finance programme at the Essex School of Accounting, Finance and Management.
