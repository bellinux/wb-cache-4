A wide range of participants were given the role of scenario planners, tasked with engaging in strategic thinking through a series of carefully crafted exercises that resulted in the creation of four scenarios set in 2040. The focal question addressed was ‘What will the <b>Scottish</b> <b>sheep</b> industry look like in 2040 and how resilient will it be to livestock disease?’ EPIC scenario planning workshops have created a new space for dialogue amongst a diverse group of sheep industry participants. These include representatives from the <b>Scottish</b> <b>sheep</b> retail sector, farming, forestry and wildlife sectors, veterinarians, epidemiologists, social scientists and Scottish Government policy makers. This exercise has facilitated social learning enabling stakeholders to build strategic partnerships by sharing experiences, understanding one another’s constraints and exchanging knowledge. Information-rich narratives based on important drivers of change (demand, Government prioritisation and technological innovation) for the <b>Scottish</b> <b>sheep</b> industry have been developed. Consideration of disease risk and transmission in each scenario helped to identify potential future vulnerabilities in disease control, surveillance and contingency planning. Strategies that could be implemented today to address these future vulnerabilities were developed. Key questions for policy makers have been framed which consider what actions might be taken now to mitigate future threats or optimise future opportunities, considering issues such as the role of cooperative approaches for disease control and maximising abattoir- based surveillance. EPIC is using these scenarios to determine how drivers of change {{will have an impact on}} industry demographics and the risks of disease introduction and disease spread as well as disease control strategies.

Each of these strategies can give rise to animal welfare, human health and /or environmental externalities.   OP dips can damage {{human health and the environment}} but minimise animal welfare losses, and cypermethrin pour-on, while non-damaging to human health and the environment, can result in some avoidable welfare losses, as ectoparasite control is less effective than for OP dips. Using multi-criteria analysis (MCA), the economics of sheep ectoparasite control from a social standpoint has also been examined.   Some profit-maximising control strategies do not necessary maximise social benefits.   A conflict can arise between the farmer and society.   The minimum cost that society would need to be willing to accept in order to finance possible incentives for sheep farmers to switch from the profit-maximising control strategy to strategies that provide different bundles of social benefits is estimated.

40|$|A {{natural way}} to control {{intestinal}} worms {{has been found in}} <b>Scottish</b> <b>sheep.</b> The discovery opens the way to transfering this natural trait into other breeds at a time when resistance to drugs is making worming of sheep increasingly costly and ineffective. Veterinarians at the University of Glasgow in Scotland have found that the Scottish Blackface sheep has a gene that enables its lambs to control the fecundity and size of intestinal worms. The gene enables the animal's immune system to recognize certain proteins m the worms and to counter them by producing an immune response. The result is that the worms become less active and lay fewer eggs, which results in a smaller population to be passed on to other sheep not carrying the gene. In trials, Scottish Blackface lambs were shown to have 50 times more resistance to worms than lambs without this trait. The effect has only been tested against one species of Ostertagia, which is the main gut parasite that affects sheep in temperate areas, but researchers are hopeful that the gene will work against other species, both temperate and tropical. The work is also enabling scientists to look for similar genes in other breeds. Work in Kenya has shown that the Red Masai breed is more resistant to worms and more productive than other breeds. If proved, this could enable East African farmers to bring their worm problem under control. Veterinarians do not see this trait ever becoming the sole method of worm control but it will be used as part of an integrated approach to use less anthelmintics. The latest findings should make it possible to breed sheep with improved worm resistance. The scientists concerned are seeking funding for a commercial breeding trial to last five or more years.

Although egg counts were lower in the second grazing season the variation among animals was greater. Egg counts were repeatable from 3 months of age. The repeatability of faecal egg counts within and between grazing seasons was about 0. 3. Animals with lower than average egg counts in the first grazing season tended to have lower than average egg counts in the second grazing season. Therefore lambs with relatively low faecal egg counts after 3 months of age are likely to retain their advantage in the following year. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

These scenarios highlight {{a number of important}} drivers that influence disease resilience: industry demographics, the role of government support and regulation and the capacity for technological innovation to support the industry to meet local and global market demand. Participants in the scenario planning exercises proposed creative, robust strategies that policy makers could consider implementing now to enhance disease control and industry resilience in multiple, uncertain futures. Using these participant-led strategies as a starting point, we offer ten key questions for policy makers and stakeholders to provoke further discussion about improving resiliency and disease preparedness.

40|$|Background and Methodology: Various {{approaches}} {{have been used}} to investigate how properties of farm contact networks impact on the transmission of infectious diseases. The potential for transmission of an infection through a contact network can be evaluated in terms of the basic reproduction number, R 0. The magnitude of R 0 is related to the mean contact rate of a host, in this case a farm, and is further influenced by heterogeneities in contact rates of individual hosts. The latter can be evaluated as the second order moments of the contact matrix (variances in contact rates, and co-variance between contacts to and from individual hosts). Here we calculate these quantities for the farms in a country-wide livestock network:. 15, 000 <b>Scottish</b> <b>sheep</b> farms in each of 4 years from July 2003 to June 2007. The analysis is relevant to endemic and chronic infections with prolonged periods of infectivity of affected animals, and uses different weightings of contacts to address disease scenarios of low, intermediate and high animal-level prevalence. Principal Findings and Conclusions: Analysis of networks of Scottish farms via sheep movements from July 2003 to June 2007 suggests that heterogeneities in movement patterns (variances and covariances of rates of movement on and off the farms) make a substantial contribution to the potential for the transmission of infectious diseases, quantified as R 0, within the farm population. A small percentage of farms (, 20 %) contribute the bulk of the transmission potential (. 80 %) and these farms could be efficiently targeted by interventions aimed at reducing spread of diseases via animal movement...|$|E
40|$|No {{historical}} account {{has previously}} been written of <b>Scottish</b> <b>sheep</b> farming, though it has played {{an important part in}} the social and economic progress of the country. The present study attempts to describe pastoral life from early times in an area which, though limited, may be considered the home of sheep and their management in Scotland. This area, the central uplands of the Borders, is described in the first chapter, together with its natural divisions and resources. The origins of the sheep farms are also examined, and linked to the establishment of large estates owned by noblemen and Melrose Abbey in mediaeval times. The distribution of farmsteads and the definition of their boundaries is seen to depend much upon the nature of the land and the wild conditions under which early settlement took place. In the next chapters it is shown that little progress in farming was made until, with a larger number of locally -based landowners and the relatively peaceful conditions after 1600, the old customary tenant system was replaced with a commercial arrangement. The rapid expansion of the Buccleuch estate at this time was of the greatest importance to the subsequent development of sheep farming in the area, as were such matters as the function and place of estate factors, the number and status of tenants, and the terms upon which farms were held. These, and various aspects of the sheepfarms themselves - size of stock, breeds, extent of arable and pasture, eighteenth century improvements distribution and management of sheep, housing, etc. - all form the historical background to the traditional social and working life of the shepherding community,, Of particular importance in this study are the chapters (6 - 9) dealing with the domestic world of farmer and shepherd, and their yearly round. This section is necessarily based upon a blend of information drawn from oral and written sources, and it provides a picture of a way of life whose traditions go back beyond history. Some practices, such as smearing, became obsolete, others, such as marketing, changed in style.

40|$|Chapter 1 – EXAMINING THE EVOLUTIONARY HISTORY OF BOVINE PAPILLOMAVIRUS IN EQUINE SARCOIDS The {{papillomavirus}} (PV) family {{consist of}} slowly evolving host-adapted DNA viruses. Bovine papillomaviruses (BPVs) - 1 and - 2 primarily cause warts {{in their natural}} host, the cow, but also lead to locally aggressive and invasive skin tumours in equids known as sarcoids. This chapter gives {{an account of the}} first phylogenetic analysis of BPV in equine sarcoids, undertaken in order to clarify the evolutionary history of the virus and its cross-species association with equine sarcoids. Phylogenetic trees were constructed for three different stretches of the BPV genome. Although two of these analyses used gene segments that proved too short to draw any firm conclusions, the phylogenetic analysis carried out on the BPV- 1 transcriptional promoter region (LCR) from cattle and horse samples provided interesting insights into the evolution of the virus. The genetic diversity seen in the LCR variants was shown to be ancient, predating domestication of both equids and cattle. The phylogenetic tree shows clear geographic segregation, with an ancestral BPV- 1 group consisting of African and Brazilian sequences and a more evolved European group of sequences. The distribution of the cattle samples within the phylogeny suggests the sequences originally evolved in ancestral cattle, and that the genetic diversity found in equine sarcoids is the result of multiple, relatively recent species jumps into horses from different seeding strains of the virus. In addition, a specific LCR sequence variant was isolated in equine samples from all countries sampled here, despite being absent from cattle samples, suggesting that viruses containing this sequence variant may have a selective advantage within the equine population. Chapter 2 - <b>SCOTTISH</b> <b>SHEEP</b> MOVEMENTS AND THEIR POTENTIAL FOR DISEASE TRANSMISSION Animal movements {{play a major role in}} the spread of livestock diseases. By identifying farms pivotal to the network of livestock movements, it may be possible to more efficiently curb the spread of disease. Diseases transmit over great ranges of timescale and infectiousness. Sheep are moved from premises to premises for a variety of different reasons and with widely varying residence times on the arrival premises, and different types of movement are important in the spread of different diseases. This report describes work identifying those sheep farms important in terms of the types of movements involved in both a fast-transmitting and a slowly-transmitting disease. In so doing it raises the possibility of achieving control of multiple infections by targeting just a single subset of farms. If this were possible it would provide a cost effective and efficient method to reduce the burden of disease in the national flock. Chapter 3 – THE IMPLICATIONS OF POST-INFECTION IMMUNITY FOR THE EPIDEMIOLOGY AND CONTROL OF Escherichia coli O 157 INFECTION OF CATTLE This report describes the use of epidemiological modelling to investigate how a period of post-infection immunity impacts the transmission dynamics of E. coli O 157. Shigatoxigenic strains of E. coli, including the O 157 strain, cause severe disease in man despite being asymptomatic in cattle, their natural reservoir host. Previous work modelling the transmission dynamics of E. coli has assumed that an animal becomes immediately susceptible on recovery from an infection, but recent experimental evidence indicates this may not be the case. In this project, stochastic models were developed for E. coli in cattle, allowing comparison of the effects of a period of post-infection immunity with the previously used assumption of immediate return to susceptibility. The results show that post-infection immunity gives lower values for outbreak duration, and for mean and variance in prevalence, and that this is observed over a biologically plausible range of the basic reproduction number, Ro. This in turn indicates that E. coli infection is likely to be more difficult to control if post-infection immunity exists, especially at higher infection prevalences. This study also reveals that if the assumption of post-infection immunity is valid, an even higher degree of individual heterogeneity in transmission is needed to explain the degree of variance in E. coli O 157 prevalence seen in the field, thus validating previous work which demonstrated the importance of supershedder animals and individual heterogeneity. This study provides the first steps in investigating how a period of immunity following E. coli infection of cattle affects conclusions drawn by previous work assuming an immediate return to susceptibility. Models allowing the incorporation of individual heterogeneity are needed to further investigate the subject...|$|E
