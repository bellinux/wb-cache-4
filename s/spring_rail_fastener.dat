40|$|The {{stiffness}} and damping of <b>rail</b> <b>fasteners,</b> {{and in particular}} the elastomeric pads inserted between the rail and sleeper, are important parameters determining the dynamic behaviour of railway track. For noise predictions, the frequency range from about 100 Hz up to 5000 Hz is important. Laboratory measurements are described in which the vertical and lateral dynamic stiffnesses of <b>rail</b> <b>fastener</b> systems have been measured under preload in the range 100 – 1000 Hz.

40|$|The {{increased}} {{noise level}} as trains travel over bridges is, in many situations, {{a source of}} disturbance for nearby residents. As well as the rolling noise radiated by the wheel and track, the vibration generated at the wheel-rail interface also propagates into the bridge structure and the vibration response {{of the components of}} the bridge is an important extra source of noise compared with tracks at-grade. Vibration isolation of the bridge structure from the rail is therefore used to reduce noise. This often takes the form of resilient <b>rail</b> <b>fasteners.</b> Two different elastic rail fastenings were therefore tested on a twin track bridge by the Swiss Railways (SBB). The bridge over the river Emme at Burgdorf, is a ballastless steel bridge with timbers between the <b>rail</b> <b>fastener</b> and the bridge. Hanging steel sleepers have been added between the wooden sleepers on which the track is supported to form a continuous deck under the track. To find the best elasticity for the <b>rail</b> <b>fasteners,</b> predictions of the bridge noise were made using the Norbert model. Measurements were made on the bridge with the track in its original state to provide parameters for the model. These included rail and sleeper vibration as well as pass-by noise from service passenger and freight trains at different speeds. For the two tracks, elastic <b>rail</b> <b>fasteners</b> from two suppliers were installed. The measurement after installation showed a clear noise reduction for the frequency range from 80 to 400 Hz of about 10 dB. However the reduction in A-weighted overall noise level is in the range of 2 to 4 dB, as indicated by the model. The results show similar reduction for both systems...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Calculation of {{a railway}} track on the {{strength}} {{is one of the}} sections of the overall complex research problems of interaction track and rolling stock. This paper describes the experimental study of horizontal transverse stiffness of railway rails with various strands of <b>rail</b> <b>fasteners.</b> Materials of this article should be relevant and will make it possible to calculate the strength of railway track using the correct and corrected performance of horizontal transverse stiffness of rail threads. Methodology. Determination of horizontal transverse rigidity of rail yarns with different designs of <b>rail</b> <b>fasteners</b> was conducted by measuring the quantities of transverse displacement of rails calculation points – namely the head and sole. For research the specialist equipment was created, made up of lineside jack DC- 20, equipped with a hydraulic pressure gauge to measure pressure and rigid rod for horizontal rail stop in the thread, the opposite of the jack. Lateral movement of the head and sole of the track were recorded, and measured with indicators of clock type within a few hundredths of a millimeter. The horizontal lateral load on the rail jack was created by the injection pressure in the cylinder which was fixed with manometer into the jack. Load of rails was conducted over 2 tons of degrees ranging from 0 to 8 tons. To obtain reliable measurement results of lateral movement of the head and the base rails, its movement was conducted for each type fasteners not less than in 3 sections. Measurements were carried out without the creation of vertical load. Findings. With the developed method was found transverse displacement magnitude of rails calculation points at different designs of <b>rail</b> <b>fasteners.</b> Originality. The experimental studies were first found the mentioned horizontal transverse stiffness of rail threads in the head and sole of modern designs for different <b>rail</b> <b>fasteners.</b> Practical value. The values of horizontal transverse stiffness of rail threads in the head and sole of modern designs for different <b>rail</b> <b>fasteners</b> that were found by the author make it possible to calculate the strength of railway track using correct and corrected values of these characteristics. ...|$|R

While {{this is partly}} attributable to slab track's decreased sound absorption qualities, a more significant factor is that slab track typically uses softer <b>rail</b> <b>fasteners</b> to provide vertical compliance similar to ballasted track, and these can lead to more noise, because they permit the rail to vibrate over a greater length.|$|R

The twist of the wing girders leads to an additional vertical displacement of the yoke curves caused by the rigid body rotation of the wing girder, and the yoke curves translate toward or away from one another, depending on the direction of twist. A similar coupling of rotation and vertical movement occurs at the FPS bearings, due to their curved sliding interfaces. These can both be considered second-order effects and were minimized in the floating bridge application by limiting {{the height of the}} components of the system. This was achieved by using a thin wing girder along the bearing yoke surface that was stiffened by an edge beam and coping the ends of the bearer bars where they connected to the friction pendulum bearings.|$|R

Additionally, compared with the nonlinear amplitude- and frequency-dependent stiffness of rail pads, the classical secant stiffness would not only severely underestimate the random vibration acceleration levels of wheel-track coupled system at frequencies of 65 – 150 [*]Hz but also alter the dominant frequency-distribution of vehicle wheel and steel rail.

The rail {{passenger}} service line branches off the existing GO Georgetown Rail corridor and connects to Toronto Pearson International Airport with a new passenger station at Terminal 1. The Spur alignment is elevated over its entire length and crosses above major existing airport access roads and existing bridges, and connects to a new UP Express Terminal 1 Station in-line with the existing Automated People Mover Station. The Spur Elevated Guideway is a 3 km long, multi span structure carrying two railway tracks. The tracks are made of continuous welded rail (CWR), directly fixed to the concrete deck.

Despite {{the steady}} {{increase}} in the length of sections of continuous welded rail on concrete sleepers, wooden railway sleepers, {{as one of the}} options of under-rail bearings, are still operated on a sufficiently large number of areas, in particular, remain uncontested in the curve of up to 350 m radius, {{as well as on the}} main ways of subways. The main types of fasteners in the most common types of intermediate rail fastenings for wooden sleepers are track screws and spikes. Since the «wheel-rail» system contact peculiarities existing in track curved sections have a significant impact on the processes of interaction between the railway track and rolling stock, it is necessary in this work to determine the rigidity of the track screws and spikes, which are directly involved in the formation of spatial rigidity of the intermediate rail fastening nodes under the influence of horizontal transverse forces. Methodology. The study of the track screw and spike rigidity was conducted experimentally for the two types of intermediate rail fastenings – D 0 and «Metro». To carry out experimental tests, 10 test sites were selected on the roads of the regional branch of «Southern Railway» of «Ukrzaliznytsia», and 8 – in the main routes of KP «Kharkiv Metro». Each of the test sites was in approximately the same operating conditions, but had different values of passed tonnage. Findings. The values of the track screw and spike rigidity were obtained. Originality. The authors first obtained the experimental data on variation in rigidity of track screw and spike, depending on the useful life for the main railways and subway routes. This allows calculation of the horizontal shear forces in track curved sections (particularly in curves of up to 350 m radius), as well as the forecast evaluation of their level change during operation. Practical value. Based on the experimental data, it was found that variation in rigidity of track screw and spike depending on the lifetime is nonlinear.
