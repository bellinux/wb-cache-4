5|$|Traditionally, the Galapagos {{sea lion}} and Japanese sea lion were {{classified}} as subspecies of the California sea lion. However, a genetic study in 2007 found that all three are in fact separate species. The lineages of the California and Japanese sea lion appear to have split off 2.2 million years ago during the Pliocene. The California sea lion differs from the Galapagos sea lion in its greater sexual dimorphism. The <b>Steller</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> is the closest extant relative of the Zalophus sea lions, being a sister taxon.|$|E
5|$|Other {{marine mammal}} prey species include nearly 20 species of seal, sea lion and fur seal. Walruses and sea otters are less {{frequently}} taken. Often, to avoid injury, killer whales disable their prey before killing and eating it. This may involve throwing {{it in the}} air, slapping it with their tails, ramming it, or breaching and landing on it. Sea lions are killed by head-butting or after a stunning blow from a tail fluke. In the Aleutian Islands, a decline in sea otter populations in the 1990s was controversially attributed by some scientists to killer whale predation, although with no direct evidence. The decline of sea otters followed a decline in harbour seal and <b>Steller</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> populations, the killer whale's preferred prey, which in turn may be substitutes for their original prey, now decimated by industrial whaling.|$|E
5|$|Killer {{whales are}} apex predators {{throughout}} their global distribution, and {{can have a}} profound effect on the behavior and population of prey species. Their diet is very broad and they can feed on many vertebrates in the ocean including salmon, rays, sharks (even white sharks), large baleen whales, and nearly 20 species of pinniped. The predation of whale calves may be responsible for annual whale migrations to calving grounds in more tropical waters, where the population of killer whales is much lower than in polar waters. Prior to whaling, it is thought that great whales were a major food source; however, after their sharp decline, killer whales have since expanded their diet, leading to the decline of smaller marine mammals. A decline in Aleutian Islands sea otter populations in the 1990s was controversially attributed by some scientists to killer whale predation, although with no direct evidence. The decline of sea otters followed a decline in harbor seal and <b>Steller</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> populations, the killer whale's preferred prey, which in turn may be substitutes for their original prey, now reduced by industrial whaling.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Steller</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> (Eumetopias jubatus) {{also known}} as the {{northern}} sea lion and Steller's sea lion, is a near threatened species of sea lions in the northern Pacific. It is the sole member of the genus Eumetopias and the largest of the eared seals (Otariidae). Among pinnipeds, it is inferior in size only to the walrus and the two elephant seals. The species is named for the naturalist Georg Wilhelm Steller, who first described them in 1741. The <b>Steller</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> has attracted considerable attention in recent decades due to significant, unexplained declines in their numbers over a large portion of their range in Alaska.|$|E

40|$|Among {{many other}} factors, {{the decline of}} the western {{distinct}} population segment of <b>Steller</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> Eumetopias jubatus in Alaska (USA) has been attributed to changes in the distribution or abundance of prey due to the cumulative effects of fisheries and large-scale climate change. However, the depletion of localized prey resources due to small-scale environmental variability and perturbations may be impeding recovery, resulting in the need to understand how the environment currently affects this species on smaller spatial and temporal scales. The objective of this study, there-fore, was to assess how <b>Steller</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> respond to changes in localized environmental features. Satellite-relayed data loggers were deployed on juvenile <b>Steller</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> (n = 24) from July 2002 to May 2004 in the Aleutian Islands and Gulf of Alaska. Weekly indices of foraging effort (mean and maximum trip duration, diving activity) of <b>Steller</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> were examined with respect to corresponding patterns of sea surface temperature (SST) data obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer. An assortment of landscape metrics was used to characterize the heterogeneity of frontal features derived from SST gradients because {{it has been suggested that}} <b>Steller</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> depend on prey patches associated with these features. Multivariate analyses indicated that fractal dimension and patch density of frontal features were significant factors for predicting different aspects of foraging effort (p 3 ̆c 0. 05; n = 6 models). Overall, results suggested that aggregated frontal features associated with small-scale temperature gradients were probably conducive to foraging effort of <b>Steller</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions,</b> but additional mechanisms should be investigated further...|$|R

Based on genetic anаlyses and local migration patterns, the global <b>Steller</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> population has traditionally been divided into an eastern and western stock at 144°W longitude, roughly through the middle of the Gulf of Alaska. Recent evidence suggests the sea lions in Russia in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Kuril Islands comprise a third Asian stock, while the sea lions on the eastern seaboard of Kamchatka and the Commander Islands belong to the western stock.|$|E

25|$|Reproductively mature male {{sea lions}} {{aggregate}} in May on traditional, well-defined reproductive rookeries, usually on beaches on isolated islands. The larger, older males establish and defend distinct territories on the rookery. A {{week or so}} later, adult females arrive, accompanied occasionally by sexually immature offspring, and form fluid aggregations throughout the rookery. Like all other otariids, Steller sea lions are polygynous. However, unlike some other species, they do not coerce individual females into harems, but control spatial territories among which females freely move about. Steller sea lions have used aquatic, semiaquatic, and terrestrial territories. Males with semiaquatic territories have the most success in defending them. The boundaries are defined by natural features, such as rocks, faults, or ridges in rocks, and territories can remain stable for 60 days. Though <b>Steller</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> males are generally tolerant of pups, one male filmed on Medny Island in Russia was documented killing and eating several pups in a first ever recorded incident of cannibalism. Though researchers are uncertain as to the motives or reasons behind said attacks, {{it is suggested that}} the bull involved may have an abnormal personality akin to being psychotic.|$|E

500|$|Adult male {{pinnipeds}} {{have several}} strategies to ensure reproductive success. Otariids establish territories containing resources that attract females, such as shade, tide pools or access to water. Territorial boundaries are usually marked by natural {{breaks in the}} substrate, and males defend their territorial boundaries with threatening vocalizations and postures, but physical fights are usually avoided. Individuals also return to the same territorial site each breeding season. In certain species, like the <b>Steller</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lion</b> and northern fur seal, a dominant male can maintain a territory {{for as long as}} 2–3 months. Females can usually move freely between territories and males are unable to coerce them, but in some species such as the northern fur seal, South American sea lion and Australian sea lion, males can successfully contain females in their territories and prevent them from leaving. In some phocid species, like the harbor seal, Weddell seal and bearded seal, the males have underwater territories called [...] "maritories" [...] near female haul-out areas. These are also maintained by vocalizations. The maritories of Weddell seal males can overlap with female breathing holes in the ice.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. We used {{radioimmunoassay}} {{methods to}} quantify arginine vasopressin (AVP), {{atrial natriuretic peptide}} (ANP), and angiotensin II (Ang 11) in plasma samples from harbor seals (Phoca vitulina richardsii), Wed-dell seals (Lepconychotes wedellii), northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris), ringed seals (Phoca hispida), California <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> (Zalophus californianus), and <b>Steller</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> (Eumetopius jubatus). Plasma concentrations of AVP, ANP, and Ang II in these pinniped species were within the ranges reported for other vertebrates under resting conditions. However, there were species, geographic and developmental variations in these hormones: Levels of AVP in plasma samples from adult <b>Steller</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> and harbor seals were higher than in pups of the same species; higher levels of plasma ANP were found in wild captured Alaskan <b>Steller</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> and in hunted ringed seals; differences in plasma levels of all three hormones were found throughout the geographic distribution of harbor seals and <b>Steller</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> in Alaska.

40|$|Prey-size {{selectivity}} by <b>Steller</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> (Eumetopias jubatus) {{is relevant}} {{for understanding the}} foraging behavior of this declining predator, but studies have been problematic because of the absence and erosion of otoliths usually used to estimate fish length. Therefore, we developed regression formulae to estimate fish length from seven diagnostic cranial structures of walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) and Atka mackerel (Pleurogrammus monopterygius). For both species, all structure measurements were related with fork length of prey (r 2 range: 0. 78 − 0. 99). Fork length (FL) of walleye pollock and Atka mackerel consumed by <b>Steller</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> was estimated by applying these regression models to cranial structures recovered from scats (feces) collected between 1998 and 2000 across {{the range of the}} Alaskan western stock of <b>Steller</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions.</b> Experimentally derived digestion correction factors were applied to take into account loss of size due to digestion. Fork lengths of walleye pollock consumed by <b>Steller</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> ranged from 3. 7 to 70. 8 cm (mean= 39. 3 cm, SD= 14. 3 cm, n= 666) and Atka mackerel ranged from 15. 3 to 49. 6 cm (mean= 32. 3 cm, SD= 5. 9 cm, n= 1685). Although sample sizes were limited, a greater proportion of juvenile (≤ 20 cm) walleye pollock were found in samples collected during the summer (June−September) on haul-out sites (64 % juveniles, n= 11 scats) than on summer rookeries (9 % juveniles, n= 132 scats) or winter (February−March) haul-out sites (3 % juveniles, n= 69 scats). Annual changes in the size of Atka mackerel consumed by <b>Steller</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> corresponded to changes in the length distribution of Atka mackerel resulting from exceptionally strong year classes. Considerable overlap (> 51 %) in the size of walleye pollock and Atka mackerel taken by <b>Steller</b> <b>sea</b> <b>lions</b> and the sizes of these species caught by the commercial trawl fishery were demonstrated...|$|R
