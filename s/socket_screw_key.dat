40|$|Background The {{removal of}} well-fixed {{acetabular}} components following THA (total hip arthroplasty) {{is a difficult}} operation and could be accompanied {{by the loss of}} acetabular bone stock. The optimal method for fixation is still under debate. The aim of this pilot study was to compare the tear-out resistance and failure behavior between osseo-integrated and non-integrated screw cups. Furthermore, we examined whether there are differences in the properties mentioned between <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> and cemented polyethylene cups. Hypothesis Tear-out resistance and related mechanical work required for the tear-out of osseo-integrated <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> are higher than in non-integrated <b>screw</b> <b>sockets.</b> Patients and methods Ten human coxal bones from six cadavers with osseo-integrated <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> (n = 4), non-integrated (implanted post-mortem, n = 3) <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> and cemented polyethylene cups (n = 3) were used for tear-out testing. The parameters axial failure load and mechanical work for tear-out were introduced as measures for determining the stability of acetabular components following THA. Results The osseo-integrated <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> yielded slightly higher tear-out resistance (1. 61 ± 0. 26 kN) and related mechanical work compared to the non-integrated <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> (1. 23 ± 0. 39 kN, P = 0. 4). The cemented polyethylene cups yielded the lowest tear-out resistance with a failure load of 1. 18 ± 0. 24 kN. Compared to the screw cups implanted while alive, they also differ on a non-significant level (P = 0. 1). Osseous failure patterns differed especially for the <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> compared to the cemented polyethylene cups. Discussion Osseo-integration did not greatly influence the tear-out stability in cementless <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> following axial loading. Furthermore, the strength of the bone-implant-interface of cementless <b>screw</b> <b>sockets</b> appears to be similar to cemented polyethylene cups. However, given the high failure load, high mechanical load and because of the related bone failure patterns, removal should not be performed by means of tear-out but rather by osteotomes or other curved cutting devices to preserve the acetabular bone stock...|$|R

5000|$|Hex <b>socket</b> <b>screw</b> {{heads are}} usually made by {{stamping}} {{the head with}} a die, plastically deforming the metal. Other ways to generate the hex socket include linear broaching and rotary broaching. Broaching the heads with a linear broach is essentially the metalworking analog of mortising wood with a mortising machine; a hole is drilled and then the corners are broached out. This operation often leaves little telltale curled chips still attached {{at the bottom of the}} socket. These are negligible for most applications.|$|R
50|$|Canadian P.L. Robertson, {{though he}} was not the first person to patent the idea of socket-head screws, was the first to {{successfully}} commercialize them, starting in 1908. <b>Socket</b> <b>screws</b> rapidly grew in popularity, and are still a favorite of mechanics today for their resistance to wear and tear, compatibility with hex keys, and ability to stop a power tool when set.

5000|$|Extant records suggest (without {{offering}} exhaustive documentation) {{that the}} idea of a hex <b>socket</b> <b>screw</b> drive was probably conceived as early as the 1860s to the 1890s, but that such screws were probably not manufactured until around 1910. Rybczynski (2000) describes a flurry of patents for alternative drive types in the 1860s to the 1890s in the US, which are confirmed to include internal-wrenching square and triangle types (that is, square and triangular sockets) (...) , but he explains that these were patented but not manufactured due to the difficulties and expense of doing so at the time. P. L. Robertson, of Milton, Ontario, Canada, first commercialised the square socket in 1908, having perfected and patented a manufacturing method (cold-forming, using the right material and the right die design).|$|R

50|$|The ink {{fountain}} holds {{a pool of}} ink and controls the amount of ink that enters the inking system. The {{most common type of}} fountain consists of a metal blade that is held in place near the fountain roller. The gap between the blade and the {{ink fountain}} roller can be controlled by adjusting <b>screw</b> <b>keys</b> to vary the amount of ink on the fountain roller. The printer adjusts the keys in or out as the ink fountain roller turns to obtain the desired quantity of ink. In simple presses, the printer must turn these screws by hand. In modern presses, the adjusting screws are moved by servomotors which are controlled by the printer at a press console. Thus the printer can make ink adjustments electronically. If the printer needs to increase or decrease ink in an area of the plate (print), he need only adjust the needed keys to allow more or less ink flow through the blade. The ink flow can also be controlled by the rotation velocity of the ink fountain roller.|$|R

The aim of this study was to review the literature about osteochondroma and to report a case of large osteochondroma in temporomandibular joint space. Treatment included osteotomy of condylar neck followed by reshaping. Case report: This study presents a 26 -year-old man with a large osteochondroma in temporomandibular joint space in left side of his face with the complaint of facial asymmetry (deviated to the right side). The patient was admitted to the Hospital of Taleghani in Tehran, in October 2002. Conclusion: Condylectomy cannot be recommended as routine in all cases. Common surgical treatments include condylectomy and reconstruction. If the tumor involves only a limited area of the condylar surface, then preservation of the remaining portion of the condyle and reshaping should be done. Reasons for not taking such a conservative approach are the possibilities of malignancy and the risk of recurrence. In this case report, because of large size of tumor, zygomatic arch was broken and osteotomy of condylar neck was used and remaining part was reshaped.

50|$|Manual impact drivers {{consist of}} a heavy outer sleeve that {{surrounds}} an inner core that is splined to it. The spline is curved {{so that when the}} user strikes the outer sleeve with a hammer, its downward force works on the spline to produce turning force on the core and any socket or work bit attached to it. The tool translates the heavy rotational inertia of the sleeve to the lighter core to generate large amounts of torque. At the same time, the striking blow from the hammer forces the impact driver down into the screw reducing or eliminating cam out. This attribute is beneficial for Phillips screws which are prone to cam out. It is also excellent for use with the Robertson square <b>socket</b> head <b>screws</b> that are in common use in Canada. It is less beneficial for slot head screws and is not beneficial at all for most other types.|$|R
