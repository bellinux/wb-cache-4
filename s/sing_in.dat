5|$|In 1931, Hu Die {{starred in}} Sing-Song Girl Red Peony (dir. Zhang Shichuan), the first Chinese sound film (although it was sound-on-disc, not sound-on-film). Compared with other silent-era film stars, who were mostly southerners with poor Mandarin, Hu Die made the {{transition}} to sound with ease. She appeared in more sound films {{and was able to}} <b>sing</b> <b>in</b> The Flower of Freedom, a real sound film of much higher quality.|$|E
5|$|The band is {{organized}} quite simply with Paul and Joe playing their songs {{in a simple}} basic guitar-synth-and-drums indie pop style and they <b>sing</b> <b>in</b> the semi-deadpan way; a review found the vocal delivery {{similar to that of}} They Might Be Giants. The raison d’être of the band is to put enough energy and spirit into their songs to make them fun.|$|E

5|$|The {{masked shrike}} gives the harsh calls typical of this family, with {{repeated}} tsr, tzr or shek notes and some whistles, and when alarmed produces a rattling krrrr. The bill may be snapped when {{the bird is}} agitated. The song, up to a minute long, is soft for a shrike, with chattering sounds interspersed with rich warbles. It resembles the songs of Hippolais species, particularly the olive-tree warbler. On rare occasions, males may <b>sing</b> <b>in</b> flight.|$|E
5|$|York {{also has}} several private schools. St Peter's School {{was founded in}} 627. The scholar Alcuin, {{who went on to}} serve Charlemagne, taught there.

Other observances at the Pandharpur temple include: Ranga-Panchami, when gulal (red powder) is sprinkled on the god's feet; and Krishna Janmashtami, Krishna's birthday, when devotees dance and <b>sing</b> <b>in</b> front of Vithoba for nine days. Other sacred days include Wednesdays, Saturdays and all other Ekadashis, {{all of which are}} considered holy in Vaishnavism.|$|E
50|$|The {{origins of}} choral music {{are found in}} {{traditional}} music, as <b>singing</b> <b>in</b> big groups is extremely widely spread in traditional cultures (both <b>singing</b> <b>in</b> one part, or in unison, like in Ancient Greece, as well as <b>singing</b> <b>in</b> parts, or in harmony, like in contemporary European choral music).|$|R

5|$|Coolsma {{found that}} Sundanese {{literature}} consisted predominantly of poetry, including the narrative wawacan, {{and thought that}} prose needed to be developed as well so that the people would embrace modernity. He considered that they rarely read, instead preferring to listen to more educated persons <b>sing</b> <b>in</b> verse. As such, the contents of written prose would not be conveyed. This {{is not to say}} that he disliked Sundanese poetry; he was appreciative of the dangding verse forms– derived from Javanese literary tradition– which were used to write wawacan, and considered an existing translation of the Gospel of Matthew in dangding to be the best Sundanese-language book in print.|$|E
5|$|Cædmon's {{only known}} {{surviving}} work is Cædmon's Hymn, the nine-line alliterative vernacular praise poem {{in honour of}} God which he supposedly learned to <b>sing</b> <b>in</b> his initial dream. The poem {{is one of the}} earliest attested examples of Old English and is, with the runic Ruthwell Cross and Franks Casket inscriptions, one of three candidates for the earliest attested example of Old English poetry. It {{is also one of the}} earliest recorded examples of sustained poetry in a Germanic language. In 1898, Cædmon's Cross was erected in his honour in the graveyard of St Mary's Church in Whitby.|$|E
5|$|For {{the human}} ear, {{it is often}} {{difficult}} to tell precisely where a cicada song originates. The pitch is nearly constant, the sound is continuous to the human ear, and cicadas <b>sing</b> <b>in</b> scattered groups. In addition to the mating song, many species have a distinct distress call, usually a broken and erratic sound emitted by the insect when seized or panicked. Some species also have courtship songs, generally quieter, and produced after a female has been drawn to the calling song. Males also produce encounter calls, whether in courtship or to maintain personal space within choruses.|$|E

5|$|I went to New York {{and we were}} in {{the studio}} and came to a break. I was sitting at the piano and told Mariah about this movie. Within two hours, we had this {{incredible}} seed for this song, 'Hero'. It was never meant for Mariah to <b>sing.</b> <b>In</b> her mind, we were writing a song for Gloria Estefan for this movie. And we went into an area that Mariah didn't really go into-in her words, {{it was a little bit}} too schmaltzy or too ballady or too old-fashioned as far as melody and lyrics.|$|E
5|$|Life {{with her}} {{grandmother}} was strict and, as Mambo felt depressed without her father, she became withdrawn, sticking to a daily routine of prayers and studying. However, she performed well at school, ranking amongst the top five in her class at Yapenka Elementary School in South Jakarta. She later became more outgoing and was known among {{her family and friends}} as a very feminine child, enjoying dresses and make-up. While in elementary school she began singing along with songs by her favourite singers Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston in her bedroom. Her mother, believing that Mambo had the ability to be a professional singer, convinced Mambo to try and <b>sing</b> <b>in</b> public while the latter was still in junior high school.|$|E
5|$|Paoli kept busy {{performing}} in Italy, South America and the United States. He returned to Puerto Rico in 1923. At the time, Amalia Paoli was residing in San Juan (in the ward of Santurce) {{where she was}} running a singing school (Academia Paoli). Antonio conducted a few performances around the island and then departed to sing at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Manhattan Opera House and the Metropolitan Opera House in Philadelphia. He had wanted to <b>sing</b> <b>in</b> the Metropolitan Opera House in New York, but apparently his competitor Enrico Caruso opposed this. Some attribute this {{to the fact that}} Caruso was a shareholder of the renowned opera house. From the U.S., the tenor would visit Curaçao, Cuba, Colombia, Haiti and Ecuador.|$|E

5|$|The {{tradition}} of Voviyo (wedding songs), sung by women during a Ros, {{is important to}} this community. The procedure is that an elderly lady, usually the yejman (wife of the master of ceremonies, who is known as yejmani) who knows the voviyos, leads the song {{while the rest of}} the women sing along. Only women whose husbands are still living may <b>sing.</b> <b>In</b> ancient times, the wedding songs expressed very lofty sentiments and gave vent to the feelings of the people about the marriage partners and their families, invoking the blessing of God on them.|$|E
5|$|When Makeba was {{eighteen}} days old, {{her mother was}} arrested and sentenced to a six-month prison term for selling umqombothi, a homemade beer brewed from malt and cornmeal. The family could not afford the small fine required to avoid a jail term, and Miriam spent {{the first six months}} of her life in jail. As a child, Makeba sang in the choir of the Kilnerton Training Institute in Pretoria, an all-black Methodist primary school that she attended for eight years. Her talent for singing earned her praise at school. Makeba was baptised a Protestant, and sang in church choirs, in English, Xhosa, Sotho, and Zulu; she later said that she learned to <b>sing</b> <b>in</b> English before she could speak the language.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the cathedral, {{including}} the chapter house, was finished in 1306, {{it was already too}} small for the developing liturgy, and unable to accommodate increasingly grand processions of clergy. Bishop John Droxford initiated another phase of building under master mason Thomas of Whitney, during which the central tower was heightened and an eight-sided Lady chapel was added at the east end by 1326. Bishop Ralph of Shrewsbury followed, continuing the eastward extension of the choir and retrochoir beyond. He oversaw the building of Vicars' Close and the Vicars' Hall, to give the men who were employed to <b>sing</b> <b>in</b> the choir a secure place to live and dine, away from the town and its temptations. He had an uneasy relationship with the citizens of Wells, partly because of his imposition of taxes, and he surrounded his palace with crenellated walls, a moat and a drawbridge.|$|E

5|$|Schools and {{hospitals}} are mentioned in records {{and these were}} built in the vicinity of temples. Marketplaces served as open air town halls where people gathered to discuss and ponder local issues. Choirs, whose main function was to sing devotional hymns, were maintained at temple expense. Young men were trained to <b>sing</b> <b>in</b> choirs in schools attached to monasteries such as Hindu Matha, Jain Palli and Buddhist Vihara. These institutions provided advanced education in religion and ethics and were well equipped with libraries (Saraswati Bhandara). Learning was imparted in the local language and in Sanskrit. Schools of higher learning were called Brahmapuri (or Ghatika or Agrahara). Teaching Sanskrit was a near monopoly of Brahmins who received royal endowments for their cause. Inscriptions record that the number of subjects taught varied from four to eighteen. The four most popular subjects with royal students were Economics (Vartta), Political Science (Dandaniti), Veda (trayi) and Philosophy (Anvikshiki), subjects that are mentioned as early as Kautilyas Arthashastra.|$|E
5|$|Two {{music videos}} {{were made for}} the song; the first one for the ballad version, {{and the other for}} the English version. The ballad version was {{directed}} by Felipe Niño.

It is filmed on a stage where shows López singing his verses, while the others members of the group, follow up with the chorus. At the end of the video the people of the orchestra starts to applaud when the group ends to <b>sing.</b> <b>In</b> the English version of the video, the plot is completely different. The video starts in a cloudy afternoon after a storm, where the group is situated in a white room. It shows López singing in a ladder when it later starts to fill with water. At {{the last part of the}} video, it shows Son by Four singing out of the house after the storm has ended.|$|E
50|$|Though she's Algerian {{she often}} <b>sings</b> <b>in</b> Egyptian-Arabic, as she never could get {{popularity}} in the Maghreb, she went later on to Egypt and the Middle-East and with success. However Ababsa's first songs were <b>sung</b> <b>in</b> Algerian-Arabic, she also <b>sings</b> occasionally <b>in</b> English, like in 'Rani Jay'. Probably the most remarkable point about her is that she never <b>sung</b> <b>in</b> French, which is widely used by North-African singers.|$|R
