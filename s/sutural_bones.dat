The present series of studies focuses {{on the influence of}} masticatory muscle function on some basic mechanisms in cranio-facial growth {{as well as on the}} effect of the functional capacity of the masseter muscle on the width of the maxillary dental arch in human subjects. The animal experimental model used to study the influence of masticatory muscle function was a non-invasive one that produced a decreased functional demand of the masticatory system in growing rats by feeding them a soft diet. The influence of re-duced masticatory muscle function on the transversal dimensions of the premaxilla, maxilla (including the dental arch) and the calvaria was studied on dry skulls, using a high precision non-contact measuring system. Moreover, a methodological study was carried out to study the influence of one preparation method on the dimensions of dry rat skulls, using axial contact radiographs. The effect of different functional demands on sutural dimensions and <b>sutural</b> <b>bone</b> apposition was studied on frontal undecalci-fied sections of the rat snout, using automatic image analysis. For the quantification of sutural dimensions contact microradiographs were used, while for <b>sutural</b> <b>bone</b> appo-sition the bone level at certain time intervals was marked with calcein. In the clinical part of this thesis the relationship between maxillary dental arch width and masseter muscle thickness in humans was studied using ultrasonography. Masticatory muscle function was found to influence the transverse growth of the skull at areas under direct muscle influence as well as the dental arch width in regions with molars under eruption. The methodological study indicated that direct comparisons between measurements on fresh specimens and those on dry rat skulls are not permis-sible, since the dimensions of the dry rat skull are smaller than those of the original fresh specimens. The dimensions and morphology of the facial sutures as well as the <b>sutural</b> <b>bone</b> apposition were negatively affected by reduced masticatory function.

Present study was carried out in the Department of Anatomy, CSM Medical University, Lucknow using fifty five dry human skulls to analyse the incidence of <b>sutural</b> <b>bones</b> at the asterion and its variation. At the asterion, sutural morphology was classified into two types: Type I- Where a sutural bone was present and Type II- Where a sutural bone was absent. Among 27 female skulls, percentage of Type I Asterion was found to be 14. 81 and Type II contributed to 85. 19 %. 17. 86 % asterion were classified as Type I and 82. 14 % as Type II in male skulls.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{quantify}} the influence of reduced masticatory muscle function on <b>sutural</b> <b>bone</b> apposition in the growing rat. METHODS: Twenty-six growing male albino rats were randomly divided into 2 equal groups; 1 (hard-diet group) received the ordinary diet of hard pellets, and the other (soft-diet group) received the powdered form of the ordinary diet mixed with water. The experimental period started when the rats were 4 weeks old and lasted 42 days. At days 0, 14, and 28, calcein was injected into all animals. At the end of the experiment, the animals were killed, and the heads were taken for preparation of undecalcified frontal sections, 120 microm thick. Three representative homologous sections for each animal in both groups were selected and studied under a fluorescence microscope. The level of bone apposition at the time of calcein injection was marked with separate fluorescing lines. Because the lines from the first injection could not be seen in all areas, bone apposition in the internasal, naso-premaxillary, and inter-premaxillary sutures was quantified from day 14 to the end of the experimental period, by using an image analysis software. RESULTS: In both groups, greater bone apposition was found between days 14 and 28 than between days 28 and 42 of the experimental period. Less bone apposition was found in the soft-diet group than in the hard-diet group in all sutures studied. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that bone apposition in the studied facial sutures in the anterior facial skeleton of the growing rat is significantly affected by reduced masticatory function...|$|R

40|$|Mechanical {{tension is}} widely applied on the suture to {{modulate}} {{the growth of}} craniofacial bones. Deeply understanding the features of bone formation in expanding sutures could help us to improve the outcomes of clinical treatment and avoid some side effects. Although {{there are reports that}} have uncovered some biological characteristics, the regular pattern of <b>sutural</b> <b>bone</b> formation in response to expansion forces is still unknown. Our study was to investigate the shape, arrangement and orientation of new bone formation in expanding sutures and explore related clinical implications. The premaxillary sutures of rat, which histologically resembles the sutures of human beings, became wider progressively under stretch force. Micro-CT detected new bones at day 3. Morphologically, these bones were forming in a finger-like pattern, projecting from the maxillae into the expanded sutures. There were about 4 finger-like bones appearing on the selected micro-CT sections at day 3 and this number increased to about 18 at day 7. The average length of these projections increased from 0. 14 mm at day 3 to 0. 81 mm at day 7. The volume of these bony protuberances increased to the highest level of 0. 12 mm 3 at day 7. HE staining demonstrated that these finger-like bones had thick bases connecting with the maxillae and thin fronts stretching into the expanded suture. Nasal sections had a higher frequency of finger-like bones occuring than the oral sections at day 3 and day 5. Masson-stained sections showed stretched fibers embedding into maxillary margins. Osteocalcin-positive osteoblasts changed their shapes from cuboidal to spindle and covered the surfaces of finger-like bones continuously. Alizarin red S and calcein deposited in the inner and outer layers of finger-like bones respectively, which showed that longer and larger bones formed on the nasal side of expanded sutures compared with the oral side. Interestingly, these finger-like bones were almost paralleling with the direction of stretch force. Inclined force led to inclined finger-like bones formation and deflection of bilateral maxillae. Additionally, heavily compressive force caused fracture of finger-like bones in the sutures. These data together proposed the special finger-like pattern of bone formation in sutures guided by stretch force, providing important implications for maxillary expansion...|$|R
40|$|Craniosynostosis is a {{developmental}} disorder characterised by the premature fusion of skull sutures in children, necessitating repetitive surgical interventions throughout infancy. A major goal of craniosynostosis {{research is to}} develop molecular adjunctive treatments to reduce the morbidity and complications associated with multiple craniofacial surgery. Recent progress in molecular biology has highlighted the regulatory effects of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP 2) antagonists, including glypicans (GPC 1 and GPC 3), on suture morphogenesis and cellular functions. Moreover, the availability of genetically-engineered murine models of human craniosynostosis and drug-delivery systems (DDS) has assisted towards investigation of the glypican-based therapeutics in vivo. However, the conventional DDS are limited by their uncontrolled release patterns and undesired pharmacokinetics. The development of clinically viable implantable DDS, prior to human trials, require preclinical studies to investigate their characterisation, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and toxicity both in vitro and in vivo (in animal models). Medical Titanium (Ti) implants nanoengineered with Titania nanotubes (TNTs) have been recognised as a superior delivery platform in complex bone therapies (i. e. orthopaedics, cancer etc.) to localise the release of therapeutics in a controlled and sustained manner. This thesis presents the use of therapeutic-releasing TNT/Ti implant technology in a murine model, to address a key clinical challenge of delaying post-operative <b>sutural</b> <b>bone</b> growth in craniosynostosis. This interdisciplinary project has three aspects and specific aims including: (i) engineering and in vitro study: to fabricate and optimise TNT/Ti implants to study glypican release in vitro and bioactivity in murine C 2 C 12 cells, (ii) pre-in vivo cell study: to evaluate the biological response at TNT-cell interface of heterogeneous (human) suture mesenchymal cells (SMCs) and (iii) in vivo study: to assess in vivo implant biocompatibility and efficacy as a glypican delivery system in TNT/Ti implants with controllable nanotube dimensions were fabricated via electrochemical anodisation process, and their protein-releasing capability and protein functionality were tested spectrophotometrically in physiological buffer and transfected C 2 C 12 cells (BMP reporter cells), respectively. A metabolic activity assay was performed to investigate human SMC behavior at TNT-cell interface. The in vivo performance was assessed using micro- CT and histology in a surgical cranial defect model to verify TNT/Ti implant biocompatibility and glypican release efficiency. A protein loaded, mechanically robust TNT/Ti implant (120 ± 10 nm pore-diameter) displayed a biphasic in vitro release profile, with high loading efficiencies and prolonged release durations, spanning across 1 to 4 weeks. The pharmacokinetic modelling, based on the protein release parameters, showed an anomalous burst release and a zero-ordered sustained release. GPC 1 and GPC 3 released from TNTs were biologically active and reduced the BMP 2 -osteogenic activity in C 2 C 12 cells. A decrease in adhesion and proliferation of SMCs at the TNT-cell interface, rendered the implant nanotopography and surface chemistry suitable for craniosynostosis therapy. The murine studies confirmed the implant biocompatibility and reiterated the sustained delivery of glypicans in vivo, demonstrated by decreased bone volume and surface area in therapeutically-intervened cranial defects. These findings confirm {{the potential of the}} nanoengineered TNT/Ti implants as an effective glypican delivery system to delay rapid post-operative bone re-growth in a murine model. This approach may evolve into a non-surgical molecular adjunct to minimise the need for recurrent re-operations in human craniosynostosis management. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Nonmetric {{traits of}} the cranium {{are often used}} to support {{hypotheses}} of the history and divergence of human populations. These studies rely {{on the assumption that}} nonmetric traits are heritable, yet few skeletal series exist with associated pedigree information that allow for the calculation of additive genetic variance, or heritability. In addition, traits for which heritabilities have been published represent dichotomous present/absent forms instead of the range of expression that can be observed for many nonmetric characters. In the present study I use a maximum-likelihood variance components analysis to calculate univariate narrow-sense heritability estimates on the skeletal series from Hallstatt, Austria, for 9 <b>sutural</b> <b>bones,</b> 27 multilevel traits, and dichotomized present/absent forms for 19 of these multilevel characters. Most of the trait heritabilities do not differ significantly from a model of h 2 0, and they have large standard errors. In a heuristic comparison of multilevel versus dichotomous trait forms, most of the nonmetric characters showed no differences in heritability between the two methods used for parsing the phenotypic variation, although where differences were noted, the presence-absence version had higher heritabilities. These results have implications not only for the use of particular nonmetric traits in population studies but also for the practice of character dichotomization in data collection...|$|E

Twelve adult female New Zealand White (NZW) rabbits, 8 to 9 months old, were randomly assigned to three groups (0 g, 42 days, n= 3; 100 g, 42 days, n= 7; or 100 g, 105 days, n= 2). Open-coil nickel-titanium springs delivered constant forces of 100 g across the sagittal suture to miniscrew implants (MSI?s) placed bilaterally in the frontal <b>bone.</b> <b>Sutural</b> separation was measured bi-weekly. Bone formation (mineral apposition) on both the endocranial and ectocranial surfaces was measured with fluorescent labels and micro-computed tomography (?CT). Qualitative histologic analyses of the suture tissues were performed using H&E staining; osteoclasts were evaluated using tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining. All 24 MSIs remained stable throughout the experiment. There was no statistically significant sutural separation in the control group. In the experimental groups, sutural separation was significant (p <. 05) at all time points up to 42 days. The rate of separation was linear during the first 42 days, and decreased between 42 to 105 days. There were moderate correlations (R= 0. 59 - 0. 89; p=<. 05) between MSI separation and bone marker separation. Mineral apposition rate (MAR), which was not measureable in the control group, showed significant deposition of bone in the experimental group. MAR was greater between 14 - 28 days than between 28 - 38 days, and it was greater on the ectocranial than endocranial surface, but neither of these differences were statistically significant. Based on the ?CT analysis, 3 D sutural volume of the experimental group increased significantly (p= 0. 02), whereas the increase in surface area was not significant (p= 0. 26). Based on these results, it is possible to separate the sagittal suture of mature rabbits. Sutural separation is limited, indicating involvement of other sutural articulations...|$|R
