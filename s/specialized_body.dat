25|$|Not {{all animals}} use vocalization {{as a means}} of {{auditory}} communication. Many arthropods rub <b>specialized</b> <b>body</b> parts together to produce sound. This is known as stridulation. Crickets and grasshoppers are well known for this, but many others use stridulation as well, including crustaceans, spiders, scorpions, wasps, ants, beetles, butterflies, moths, millipedes, and centipedes. Another means of auditory communication is the vibration of swim bladders in bony fish. The structure of swim bladders and the attached sonic muscles varies greatly across bony fish families, resulting {{in a wide variety of}} sounds. Striking body parts together can also produce auditory signals. A well-known example of this is the tail tip vibration of rattlesnakes as a warning signal. Other examples include bill clacking in birds, wing clapping in manakin courtship displays, and chest beating in gorillas.|$|E

50|$|Gilmore {{retains the}} central {{idea that the}} general law of {{contract}} is a residual category, that is, what is left after all the <b>specialized</b> <b>bodies</b> of law have been added up. The world of commercial law, and within it contract law, was largely {{the product of the}} Industrial Revolution. It was created quite rapidly, outlined in little more than a half-century. Initially, for legal greats like Justice Story, there was no separate theory of contracts. Rather, there were <b>specialized</b> <b>bodies</b> of law that had been developed to address the various needs of the Industrial Revolution. Gilmore alleges, that rather than contract coming first, and the various specialties being developed afterwards, it actually was the opposite, where contract enveloped pre-existing specialties, like negotiable instruments and sales.|$|R

What anti-corruption bodies do exist currently in the Czech Republic and what recommendations can be drawn from the foreign institutional arrangements?

5000|$|Elachistosuchus was {{originally}} {{thought to be}} a pseudosuchian archosaur by Janensch (1949). Janensch diagnosed it among other pseudosuchians by its small body size, the lack of a <b>specialized</b> <b>body</b> plan, and the presence of a large posttemporal fenestra and what he believed to be an antorbital fenestra. Walker (1966) reinterpreted Elachistosuchus as a rhynchocephalian closely related to the only living genus Sphenodon (the tuatara), based on the long front portion of the jugal bone, the allegedly acrodont dentition, the large posttemporal fenestra, the absence of an external lower jaw fenestra, and a strongly twisted end of the humerus. Walker (1966) also argued that the antorbital fenestra identified by Janensch actually represented a damaged opening for the lacrimal canal.|$|E

50|$|The Labour {{inspection}} {{was officially}} {{created by the}} 19 May 1874 law during the Third Republic, establishing a body of 15 divisionary inspectors, and several departmental inspectors. However, they were not very efficient.

It was first of all charged of the surveillance of the implementation of the 22 March 1841 law prohibiting child labour of less than 8 years old. This law had been enacted following reports by the physician René Villermé. The 1890 law also enacted a maximal length of work for children, women and underage girls.|$|E

50|$|Bands have a loose organization. They can {{split up}} (in spring/summer) or regroup (in winter camps), as the Inuit, {{depending}} on the season, or member families can disperse to join other groups. Their power structure is often egalitarian, a feature, it has been argued, which arose from {{the emergence of a}} counter-dominant mentality that overthrew the hierarchical relationships in man's evolutionary background, by vigilance over sharing. The best hunters would have their abilities recognized, but such recognition did not lead to the assumption of authority, as pretensions to control others would be met by disobedience.. Judgments determined by collective discussion among the elders were formulated in terms of custom, as opposed to the law-governed and coercive agency of a <b>specialized</b> <b>body,</b> as occurred with the rise of the more complex societies that arose upon the establishment of sedentary agriculture.|$|E
