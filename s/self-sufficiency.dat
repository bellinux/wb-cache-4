5|$|Eudaimonia, {{or human}} flourishing, depends on <b>self-sufficiency</b> (αὐτάρκεια), equanimity, arete, love of humanity, parrhesia and {{indifference}} to the vicissitudes of life (ἁδιαφορία).|$|E
5|$|One {{approach}} to sustainable living, exemplified by small-scale urban transition towns and rural ecovillages, seeks to create self-reliant communities based on principles of simple living, which maximize <b>self-sufficiency</b> particularly in food production. These principles, {{on a broader}} scale, underpin {{the concept of a}} bioregional economy. These approaches often utilize commons based knowledge sharing of open source appropriate technology.|$|E
5|$|As {{with any}} war of such length, the {{drawn-out}} Byzantine–Arab Wars had long-lasting effects {{for both the}} Byzantine Empire and the Arab world. The Byzantines experienced extensive territorial loss, while the invading Arabs gained strong control in the Middle East and Africa. The focus of the Byzantine Empire shifted from the western reconquests of Justinian to a primarily defensive position, against the Islamic armies on its eastern borders. Without Byzantine interference in the emerging Christian states of western Europe, the situation gave a huge stimulus to feudalism and economic <b>self-sufficiency.</b>|$|E
5|$|Brazil {{has one of}} {{the largest}} {{renewable}} energy programs in the world, involving production of ethanol fuel from sugar cane, and ethanol now provides 18 percent of the country's automotive fuel. As a result of this and the exploitation of domestic deep water oil sources, Brazil, which for years had to import a large share of the petroleum needed for domestic consumption, recently reached complete <b>self-sufficiency</b> in liquid fuels.|$|E
5|$|Some {{philosophers}} and Christians resisted {{the demands of}} the body and the pleasures of food, and adopted fasting as an ideal. Food became simpler in general as urban life in the West diminished, trade routes were disrupted, and the rich retreated to the more limited <b>self-sufficiency</b> of their country estates. As an urban lifestyle came to be associated with decadence, the Church formally discouraged gluttony, and hunting and pastoralism were seen as simple, virtuous ways of life.|$|E
5|$|Suharto government's health-care {{programs}} (such as the Puskesmas program) increased {{life expectancy}} from 47 years (1966) to 67 years (1997) while cutting {{infant mortality rate}} by more than 60%. The government's Inpres program launched in 1973 resulted in primary school enrollment ratio reaching 90% by 1983 while almost eliminating education gap between boys and girls. Sustained support for agriculture resulted in Indonesia reaching rice <b>self-sufficiency</b> by 1984, an unprecedented achievement which earns Suharto a gold medal from FAO in November 1985.|$|E
5|$|Welsh cuisine {{encompasses}} the cooking traditions and practices {{associated with the}} country of Wales and the Welsh people. While there are {{a large number of}} dishes that can be considered Welsh due to their ingredients and/or history, dishes such as cawl, Welsh rarebit, laverbread, Welsh cakes, bara brith and the Glamorgan sausage have all been regarded as symbols of Welsh food. Some variation in dishes exists across the country, with notable differences existing in the Gower Peninsula; an historically isolated rural area which developed <b>self-sufficiency</b> in food production. See Cuisine of Gower.|$|E
5|$|Williams {{encouraged}} the local aircraft {{industry as a}} means to further the <b>self-sufficiency</b> of the Air Force and Australian aviation in general. He played a personal part {{in the creation of the}} Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation in November 1936, headed up by former Squadron Leader Lawrence Wackett, late of the RAAF's Experimental Section. Williams made the first overseas flight in an aeroplane designed and built in Australia when he accompanied Squadron Leader Allan Walters and two aircrew aboard a Tugan Gannet to Singapore in February 1938.|$|E
5|$|With {{a lack of}} {{domestic}} capital that was required for economic growth, the New Order reversed Sukarno's economic <b>self-sufficiency</b> policies and opened selected economic sectors {{of the country to}} foreign investment though the 1967 Foreign Investment Law. Suharto travelled to Western Europe and Japan to promote investment in Indonesia. The first foreign investors to re-enter Indonesia included mining companies Freeport Sulphur Company / International Nickel Company. Following government regulatory frameworks, domestic entrepreneurs (mostly Chinese-Indonesians) emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the import-substitution light-manufacturing sector such as Astra Group and Salim Group.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1930s, {{however, the}} Argentine economy {{deteriorated}} notably. The {{single most important}} factor in this decline has been political instability since 1930, when a military junta took power, ending seven decades of civilian constitutional government. In macroeconomic terms, Argentina {{was one of the most}} stable and conservative countries until the Great Depression, after which it turned into one of the most unstable. Despite this, up until 1962 the Argentine GDP per capita was higher than of Austria, Italy, Japan and of its former colonial master, Spain. Successive governments from the 1930s to the 1970s pursued a strategy of import substitution to achieve industrial <b>self-sufficiency,</b> but the government's encouragement of industrial growth diverted investment from agricultural production, which fell dramatically.|$|E
5|$|Canada's {{economic}} integration with the United States has increased significantly since World War II. The Automotive Products Trade Agreement of 1965 opened Canada's borders {{to trade in}} the automobile manufacturing industry. In the 1970s, concerns over energy <b>self-sufficiency</b> and foreign ownership in the manufacturing sectors prompted Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's Liberal government to enact the National Energy Program (NEP) and the Foreign Investment Review Agency (FIRA). In the 1980s, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservatives abolished the NEP and changed the name of FIRA to Investment Canada, to encourage foreign investment. The Canada– United States Free Trade Agreement (FTA) of 1988 eliminated tariffs between the two countries, while the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) expanded the free-trade zone to include Mexico in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Having {{between a}} fifth or sixth of the arable or good {{pastoral}} land and {{roughly the same}} amount of coastline as England and Wales, marginal pastoral agriculture and fishing were two of the most important aspects of the Medieval Scottish economy. With poor communications, in the Early Middle Ages most settlements needed to achieve a degree of <b>self-sufficiency</b> in agriculture. Most farms were based around a family unit and used an infield and outfield system. Arable farming grew in the High Middle Ages and agriculture entered a period of relative boom between the thirteenth century and late fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Flemming Knudson {{was moved}} to head the Royal Greenland fishing concern and current CEO Michael Binzer was hired with a mandate to lead the company towards greater {{commercialisation}} and <b>self-sufficiency</b> under the Qarsoq 2012 ("Arrow 2012") plan. On 13 June, SAS announced its intention to sell its stake in Air Greenland, a move later incorporated into its restructuring programme, but as of 2012 it has not found any buyers. On 1 October, the airline introduced its e-ticket system. Also in 2007, Air Greenland began direct service with Baltimore/Washington International Airport in the United States of America. After sixty American visitors were stranded by a strike of Air Greenland employees and the company refused to make alternate arrangements for their return, ticket sales slumped and the route was closed in March 2008.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with PBS in 2006, (after sixteen years of experience with Grameen Bank as a social business) Yunus expressed satisfaction in the micro-credit system of Grameen bank as a motivation and {{an opportunity for the}} poor to improve their own situations. He stressed that he has observed that Grameen's borrowers attain a sense of confidence and <b>self-sufficiency</b> when they pay back their loans from Grameen bank. While being careful not to criticise charity's rightful place, he added that the recipient of a charitable gift does not experience these long-term emotional benefits in the same way.|$|E
5|$|Interior Secretary Carl Schurz {{carried out}} Hayes's American Indian policy, {{beginning}} with preventing the War Department from {{taking over the}} Bureau of Indian Affairs. Hayes and Schurz carried out a policy that included assimilation into white culture, educational training, and dividing Indian land into individual household allotments. Hayes believed that his policies would lead to <b>self-sufficiency</b> and peace between Indians and whites. The allotment system was favored by liberal reformers at the time, including Schurz, but instead proved detrimental to American Indians. They lost much of their land through later sales to unscrupulous white speculators. Hayes and Schurz reformed the Bureau of Indian Affairs to reduce fraud and gave Indians responsibility for policing their understaffed reservations.|$|E
5|$|The Commercial Import Program, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the Commodity Import Program (CIP), was an economic aid arrangement between South Vietnam and its main supporter, the United States. It lasted from January 1955 until the Fall of Saigon in 1975 and the dissolution of South Vietnam following the invasion by North Vietnam after US forces had withdrawn from the country due to the 1973 cease-fire agreement. The initiative was a trading plan {{that was designed to}} inject large amounts of American capital into the South Vietnamese economy to help fuel its industrialisation, growth and <b>self-sufficiency,</b> without incurring the high levels of inflation that would normally occur in such a drastic injection of money.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Scotland in the Middle Ages covers {{all forms of}} {{economic}} activity in the modern boundaries of Scotland, between {{the departure of the}} Romans from Northern Britain in the fifth century, until the advent of the Renaissance in the early sixteenth century, including agriculture, crafts and trade. Having between a fifth or sixth of the arable or good pastoral land and roughly the same amount of coastline as England and Wales, marginal pastoral agriculture and fishing were two of the most important aspects of the Medieval Scottish economy. With poor communications, in the early Middle Ages most settlements needed to achieve a degree of <b>self-sufficiency</b> in agriculture. Most farms were operated by a family unit and used an infield and outfield system.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} population {{at the time}} of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000 and two million, with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada's Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples. As a consequence of European colonization, the population of Canada's indigenous peoples declined by forty to eighty percent, and several First Nations, such as the Beothuk, disappeared. The decline is attributed to several causes, including the transfer of European diseases, such as influenza, measles, and smallpox to which they had no natural immunity, conflicts over the fur trade, conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers, and the loss of indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations' <b>self-sufficiency.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} cutbacks inevitably {{had major}} implications for Gibraltar's economy, which had {{up to that}} point depended largely on defence expenditure. It prompted the territory's government to shift its economic orientation and place a much greater emphasis on encouraging tourism and establishing <b>self-sufficiency.</b> Tourism in Gibraltar was encouraged through refurbishing and pedestrianising key areas of the city, building a new passenger terminal to welcome cruise ship visitors and opening new marinas and leisure facilities. By 2011, Gibraltar was attracting over 10 million visitors a year compared to a population of 29,752, giving it one of the highest tourist-to-resident ratios in the world.|$|E
5|$|During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Nablus {{came under}} Jordanian control. Thousands of Palestinian {{refugees}} fleeing from areas captured by Israel arrived in Nablus, settling {{in refugee camps}} {{in and around the}} city. Its population doubled and the influx of refugees put a heavy strain on the city's resources. Three such camps still located within the city limits today are Ein Beit al-Ma', Balata and Askar. During the Jordanian period, the adjacent villages of Rafidia, Balata al-Balad, al-Juneid and Askar were annexed to the Nablus municipality. The 1967 Six-Day War ended in the Israeli occupation of Nablus. Many Israeli settlements were built around Nablus during the 1980s and early 1990s. The restrictions placed on Nablus during the First Intifada were met by a back-to-the-land movement to secure <b>self-sufficiency,</b> and had a notable outcome in boosting local agricultural production.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} Middle Ages, poor {{transport}} forced <b>self-sufficiency</b> on small settlements. Lacking the urban centres created under the Romans {{in the rest}} of Britain, the economy of Scotland in the early Middle Ages was overwhelmingly agricultural. With a lack of significant transport links and wider markets, most farms had to produce a self-sufficient diet of meat, dairy products and cereals, supplemented by hunter-gathering. Limited archaeological evidence indicates that throughout Northern Britain, farming was done on single homesteads or amongst a small cluster of three or four homes. Each of these probably contained a nuclear family, with kinship relationships likely to be common among neighbouring houses and settlements, reflecting the partition of land through inheritance. A system was adopted that distinguished between the infield, around the settlement, where crops were grown every year, and the outfield, further away, where crops were grown and then left fallow in different years. This would be the predominant system until the eighteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Ranavalona I (born Rabodoandrianampoinimerina; 1778– August 16, 1861), {{also known}} as Ramavo and Ranavalo-Manjaka I, was {{sovereign}} of the Kingdom of Madagascar from 1828 to 1861. After positioning herself as queen {{following the death of}} her young husband and second cousin, Radama I, Ranavalona pursued a policy of isolationism and <b>self-sufficiency,</b> reducing economic and political ties with European powers, repelling a French attack on the coastal town of Foulpointe, and taking vigorous measures to eradicate the small but growing Malagasy Christian movement initiated under Radama I by members of the London Missionary Society. She made heavy use of the traditional practice of fanompoana (forced labor as tax payment) to complete public works projects and develop a standing army of between 20,000 and 30,000 Merina soldiers, whom she deployed to pacify outlying regions of the island and further expand the realm. The combination of regular warfare, disease, difficult forced labor and harsh measures of justice resulted in a high mortality rate among soldiers and civilians alike during her 33-year reign.|$|E
5|$|Scotland has an {{extensive}} coastline and vast areas of difficult terrain and poor agricultural land. In this period, more land became marginal due to climate change, resulting in relatively light human settlement, {{particularly in the}} interior and Highlands. Northern Britain lacked urban centres and settlements were based on farmsteads and around fortified positions such as brochs, with mixed-farming primarily based on <b>self-sufficiency.</b> In this period, changes in settlement and colonisation meant that the Pictish and Brythonic languages began to be subsumed by Gaelic, English, and, {{at the end of}} the period, by Old Norse. Life expectancy was relatively low, leading to a young population, with a ruling aristocracy, freemen, and relatively large numbers of slaves. Kingship was multi-layered, with different kings surrounded by their war bands that made up the most important elements of armed forces, and who engaged in both low-level raiding and occasional longer-range, major campaigns.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{civilian}} administration encouraged Japanese {{businessmen and}} settlers to the expand phosphate mining and copra production, which came into commercial existence during the German colonial era. During this time, new infrastructure was built between towns—including road and harbour facilities, and electricity and sewerage lines were laid out. Immigration from Japan, Okinawa and Korea to Palau intensified {{as a result}} of new job opportunities. A state-owned enterprise, Nanyo Kohatsu Kabushiki Kaisha (South Seas Colonization Corporation) was formed in 1936 to streamline the islands' economic activities with the administration objective of developing the islands' <b>self-sufficiency</b> capabilities. In the late 1930s, Japanese pearl divers made regular visits to the Arafura Sea, and stopped by Palau from October to April. The influx of pearl divers from Japan {{led to the development of}} the island's tourist industry, and some Japanese settlers from Saipan opened new cafés, geisha houses and liquor houses in Koror to cater to the pearl divers during their stopovers in between October to April.|$|E
5|$|The {{municipality}} {{aims for}} a coherent and holistic {{administration of the}} water cycle to protect against or clean up previous pollution and encourage green growth and <b>self-sufficiency.</b> The main issues are excessive nutrients, adapting to increasing levels of precipitation brought on by climate change, and securing the water supply. These goals have manifested {{in a number of}} large water treatment projects often in collaboration with private partners. In the 2000s, underground rainwater basins were built across the city while the two lakes Årslev Engsø and Egå Engsø were created in 2003 and 2006 respectively. The number of sewage treatment plants is planned to be reduced from 17 to 2 by 2025 as the treatment plants in Marselisborg and Egå are scheduled for expansion to take over all waste water treatment. They have already been refitted for biogas production to become net producers of electricity and heat. To aid the new treatment plants, and avoid floodings, sewage and stormwater throughout the municipality is planned to be separated into two different drainage systems. Construction began in 2017 in several areas, but it is a long process and is scheduled to be finished by 2085.|$|E
5|$|The priory {{was founded}} in the early 13th century, and {{dedicated}} to Thomas Becket. The founder, William de Courtney, was a grandson of Reginald Fitzurse, one of Becket's murderers. In 1849 a reliquary was found in St Paul's Church, Kewstoke that was believed to have come originally from the priory and to contain the blood of Thomas Becket. It is {{believed that it was}} moved to St Paul's for safe keeping {{at the time of the}} Dissolution of the Monasteries and is now in the Museum of Somerset in Taunton. The first building had been completed by 1242 as it is described in a letter to Jocelin of Wells. The foundation was confirmed by Edward II in 1325. It was home to a small community of Victorine Canons. The Victorine order were founded at the Abbey of St. Victor, Paris and founded St Augustine's Abbey in Bristol which became Bristol Cathedral. Members of the priory were influenced by the Cistercians who emphasised manual labour and <b>self-sufficiency</b> so that the clerks who had taken holy orders worked on the farm. The priory also provided the clergy for the local parish Church of St Paul, Kewstoke.|$|E
5|$|The priory was founded, by William de Courtney, in {{the early}} 13th century, and {{dedicated}} to Thomas Becket.

They were Victorine Canons who were influenced by the Cistercians who emphasised manual labour and <b>self-sufficiency</b> so that the clerks who had taken holy orders worked on the farm, {{as well as providing}} clergy for surrounding churches. Despite endowments of land the priory was not wealthy until the 15th century when further building work, including the current priory church, infirmary and barn was undertaken. It was dissolved in 1536 and then owned by local noblemen and leased to local farmers. In 1968 the priory and adjoining land of Middle Hope was purchased by the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty as part of Project Neptune. The following year the priory was taken over by the Landmark Trust who spent 20 years on restoration work, and now rent out the farmhouse as holiday accommodation.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the European population before industrialization lived in rural communities or isolated farms and households. The norm was <b>self-sufficiency</b> with {{only a small percentage}} of production being exported or sold in markets. Large towns were exceptions and required their surrounding hinterlands to support them with food and fuel. The dense urban population could support a wide variety of food establishments that catered to various social groups. Many of the poor city dwellers had to live in cramped conditions without access to a kitchen or even a hearth, and many did not own the equipment for basic cooking. Food from vendors was in such cases the only option. Cookshops could either sell ready-made hot food, an early form of fast food, or offer cooking services while the customers supplied some or all of the ingredients. Travellers, such as pilgrims en route to a holy site, made use of professional cooks to avoid having to carry their provisions with them. For the more affluent, there were many types of specialist that could supply various foods and condiments: cheesemongers, pie bakers, saucers, waferers, etc. Well-off citizens who had the means to cook at home could on special occasions hire professionals when their own kitchen or staff could not handle the burden of throwing a major banquet.|$|E
