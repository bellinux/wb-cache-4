According to Network Rail, the main {{problems have}} been track-circuit failures, broken rails, track faults, points failures and overhead line equipment (OLE) failures. Network Rail, {{which is responsible for}} the infrastructure, intended to improve performance by work carried out during a planned closure of London Liverpool Street station over Christmas and New Year 2007/8. This allowed much of the outer London overhead line equipment to be replaced by modern, <b>self-tensioning</b> lines. The work was carried out, but overran at short notice by some 24 hours, causing ridicule in the national press.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} 1930 Lackawanna 3 kV DC electrification {{was converted}} in 1984 to 25 kV 60 Hz, {{as part of}} the re-electrification of the Morris & Essex Lines which the then-Montclair Branch was grouped with at the time. The 2002 extension of electrification to Great Notch together with the Montclair Connection is similar in construction, except that hot-dip galvanized steel poles are used; many of these poles are painted dark green for esthetic reasons, in contrast with the old Lackawanna poles which are painted dark red. Catenary construction is uniform throughout; compound (3-wire) with a zigzag horizontal profile, but without <b>self-tensioning,</b> just like on most sections of the M&E lines.|$|E
5000|$|It is more {{efficient}} than the older multiple belt system and may consume less space in the engine compartment. By using a single, wider belt instead of multiple, thinner belts, the belt may be put under increased tension without stretching. Higher tension reduces slip, which increases belt life and mechanical efficiency. Reduced slip can allow the use of lower-ratio pulleys; this reduces the load on the engine, increasing fuel economy and available power. The tendency for V-belts to [...] "flip over" [...] in the pulley groove (at high RPM and/or when the belt stretches) is eliminated, and a serpentine belt is also much easier to maintain and replace, {{since there is no}} need to remove multiple belts in order to replace one of them, although newer adjustable-length V-belts ("link belts") can be put on without having to remove other belts, and their link design also allows a <b>self-tensioning</b> characteristic to reduce the risk of flipping over. Also since only one movable belt tensioner is required all of the peripheral components (alternator, A/C compressor, etc.) can simply be mounted to the engine without the need to swivel.|$|E

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that characteristic nodules emerge in cultures of several malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) cell lines. Instead of excessive local cell proliferation, the nodules arise by Myosin II-driven cell contractility. The aggregation {{process can be}} prevented or reversed by suitable pharmacological inhibitors of acto-myosin contractility. A cell-resolved elasto-plastic model of the multicellular patterning process indicates that the morphology {{and size of the}} nodules as well as the speed of their formation is determined by the mechanical tension cells exert on their neighbors, and the stability of cell-substrate adhesion complexes.

40|$|This {{study focused}} on the {{optimisation}} of offshore marine fish-cage farming in Tenerife, Canary Islands. The main objective was to select the most suitable sites for offshore cage culture. This is {{a key factor in}} any aquaculture operation, affecting both success and sustainability. Moreover, it can solve conflicts between different coastal activities, making a rational use of the coastal space. Site selection was achieved by using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) based models and related technology, such as satellite images and Global Positioning System (GPS), to support the decision-making process. Three different cage systems were selected and proposed for different areas around Tenerife. Finally, a particulate waste distribution model (uneaten feed and faeces) was developed, also using GIS, for future prediction of the dispersive nature of selected sites. This can reduce the number of sites previously identified as most suitable, by predicting possible environmental impacts on the benthos if aquaculture was to be developed on a specific site. The framework for spatial multi-criteria decision analysis used in this study began with a recognition and definition of the decision problem. Subsequently, 31 production functions (factors and constraints) were identified, defined and subdivided into 8 sub-models. These sub-models were then integrated into a GIS database in the form of thematic layers and later scored for standardization. At this stage, the database was verified by field sampling to establish the quality of data used. The decision maker's preferences were incorporated into the decision model by assigning weights of relative importance to the evaluation under consideration. These, together with the thematic layers, were integrated by using Multi-criteria Evaluation (MCE) and simple overlays to provide an overall assessment of possible alternatives. Finally, sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the model robustness. The integration, manipulations and presentation of the results by means of GIS-based models in this sequential and logical flow of steps proved to be very effective for helping the decision-making process of site selection in study. On the whole, this study revealed the usefulness of GIS as an aquaculture planning and management tool. Cage systems that can withstand harsh environments were found to be suitable for use over a broader area of Tenerife's coastline. Thus, the more robust <b>self-tensioned</b> cage (SeaStation®) could be used over a greater area than the weaker gravity cages (Corelsa®). From the 228 km 2 of available area for siting cages in the coastal regions with depth of 50 m, the suitable area (sum of scores 6, 7 and 8) for siting SeaStation® cages was 61 km 2, while the suitable area for SeaStation® and Corelsa® cages was 49 and 37 km 2 respectively. Most of the variation between these three cage systems was found among the intermediate suitability scores. It was concluded that the biggest differences in suitable area among cage systems are between Corelsa® and SeaStation® systems, followed by differences between Corelsa® and OceanSpar® cages, and OceanSpar® and SeaStation® respectively. This variability was mostly located on the N and NNW of the island, where waves, both long and short-term, are higher...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the performance of}} wooden structural floors equipped with the <b>self-tensioning</b> system patented by the authors, consisting of a force multiplying mechanism connected to a <b>self-tensioning</b> tendon, which is activated automatically when the load {{is applied to the}} structural element. The paper describes the system’s difficulties when the structural floor is subjected to asymmetrical loads. The proposed solution consists of anchoring the tendon by an adhesive connection in {{the central part of the}} piece yielding a favorable redistribution of the bending moments and an effective performance in terms of deformations.

40|$|It is {{described}} a <b>self-tensioning</b> system constituted by a force multiplying device which, {{attached to the}} supports of {{the ends of the}} structural element, is able to convert the vertical resultant from the gravitatonial actions into an effective tensioning action, through the movement that was induced by a set of rods. The <b>self-tensioning</b> system is able to offer a high performance, thanks to the beneficial effect of the opposite deflection generated by the tensioning, in proportion to the increasing of the gravitational action. This allows to design long-span timber ribbed floors using reduced depths. The complexity of calculation due to the non-linearity of the system can be obviated with the methodology of analysis developed in the article. In order to illustrate the advantages of the <b>self-tensioning</b> system and the methodology of analysis which were developed, six cases of ribbed floors have been analysed, with spans of 9, 12 and 15 m and variable using loads of 3, 00 kN/m 2 and 5, 00 kN/m 2...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{patented}} <b>self-tensioning</b> {{system for}} long-span wooden structural floors is described {{that increases the}} performance of the deflected sections in terms of both resistance and deformation. The system is based on a force multiplier mechanism composed by two connecting rods which are secured to a post-stressing tendon. The mechanical device is activated by the transmission of the load from the structural element to the supports, causing an elongation and stressing the tendon. This transmission comes with a slight vertical displacement of the supports. Throughout this system, the intensity of the tensioning force varies with the applied load; thus, a more favorable bending moment distribution from the load is obtained, and the relative deformations of the different sections of the piece are reduced. This article presents a comparative study of the structural behavior of π-shape cross section wooden structural floors with spans from 9 m to 18 m, comparing sections with and without pre-stress, and sections with the <b>self-tensioning</b> system...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAn {{essential}} {{element in the}} web-trap architecture, the capture silk spun by ecribellate orb spiders consists of glue droplets sitting astride a silk filament. Mechanically this thread presents a mixed solid/liquid behaviour unknown to date. Under extension, capture silk behaves as a particularly stretchy solid, owing to its molecular nanosprings, but it totally switches behaviour in compression to now become liquid-like: it shrinks with no apparent limit while exerting a constant tension. Here, we unravel the physics underpinning the unique behaviour of this " liquid wire " and demonstrate that its mechanical response originates in the shape-switching of the silk filament induced by buckling within the droplets. Learning from this natural example of geometry and mechanics, we manufactured novel programmable liquid wires that present novel pathways {{for the design of}} new hybrid solid-liquid materials. H ybrids made of different materials often display effective properties far exceeding those of their components (1) : zinc-coated steel is both strong and corrosion-resistant, metal foams (hybrids of metal and air) are stiff, light and crush-able at the same time, making them perfect candidates to absorb energy in a car crash (2, 3). Nature also provides many exquisite examples of hybrid design such as the seashell nacre, both stiff and tough thanks to its inner 'brick-and-mortar' structure composed of rigid, though brittle, inclusions surrounded by a crack arresting soft organic matrix (4), or the bamboo stem with its hollow core and honeycomb-shaped cells that maximize the ratio of bending rigidity over weight (5). A most interesting natural hybrid material is the spi-der's capture thread, which consists of a core filament that supports glue droplets. Here we report on the arresting mechanical behaviour of this capture thread, that changes from solid-like in extension to liquid-like in compression. We trace this behaviour back to the core filament's buckling inside the droplets. A synthetic version of this natural system then allows us to copy the remarkable properties of spider's capture thread to a novel type of hybrid material. Spiders use different kinds of silk to build their webs, and a typical ecribellate orb-web combines dry and smooth radial threads with wet and droplet-covered spiral threads (6, 7, 8, 9, 10). The adhesive nature of these droplets enables the spiral capture thread to perform its primary function of catching insect preys (6). Apart from being sticky, these capture threads also prove to be particularly resilient to tensile tests: extensive studies on their mechanical behaviour (11, 6) revealed that, when stretched, the thread elongates to three times its web-length without breaking and recoils back with no noticeable hysteresis or sagging when relaxed (12). This stretchiness confers spider silk a strength tenfold that of natural or synthetic rubber (13, 14). These remarkable extensional properties rely on the macromolecular architecture of capture silk (15, 16). The ability to cope with stretch is crucial for spider capture threads for it provides their unusually large toughness (energy required for rupture), which in turn allows them to absorb the kinetic energy of incident preys without breaking. Far less understood is the behaviour of the thread when compressed: unlike any solid fibre that sags or buckles, it keeps taut and self-adapts to compression. Figure 1 illustrates this singular behaviour, reminiscent of the response of liquid films to compression events: liquid films do not buckle upon squeezing, but rather self-adapt (17). And as for liquid films, self-adaptation for the capture thread is an indication for fibre <b>self-tension.</b> This liquid-like behaviour in compression suggests that more than merely endowing the web with adhesion, capture silk might well have the additional mechanical function of preserving the web structural integrity. Indeed, without self-adaptation, single sticky strands would touch during relaxation events and thereby irremediably damage the web. With sagging suppressed, the sticky strands are secured apart...|$|R
40|$|Several {{aspects of}} the {{mechanical}} behavior of single-layer graphene are modeled from perspectives ranging from density functional theory (DFT) to finite element-based large-deformation continuum mechanics of membranes and their mechanical interactions with substrates and indentors. A novel hyperelastic constitutive formulation for the membrane response of graphene is based on joint invariants of the log strain measure and the 6 th-order structure tensor comprising the C 6 v symmetry group of unstretched planar graphene; the resulting formulation leads to simple functional forms that accurately capture the constitutive response inferred from current and prior DFT simulations up to “large” elastic strain, along with transparent assessments of the eventual loss of strong elipticity. DFT perturbation methods provide phonon dispersion relations for the three acoustic and three optical phonons of a two-atom primitive cell in both reference and deformed configurations. Related symmetry-based coordinates are used to interpolate phonon dispersion relations over deformed invariant Brillouin zones, providing independent insights into the stability of deformed graphene with respect to both long wavelength elastic instabilities as well as soft modes having zero frequency at a nonzero wavevector. Mechanical interaction of graphene with substrates such as amorphous silica or contacting diamond nanoindentor tips occurs primarily through van der Waals interactions, which were quantified through interface traction/separation relations fit {{to a number of}} types of available experimental data, including <b>self-tensioning</b> of suspended membranes, blister delamination, and pull-in of pressurized membranes, with the resulting continuum finite elment simulations being in good agreement with experimental observations. Finite element simulations of the nanoindentation of suspended graphene membrane are generally in agreement with prior work by Kysar and coworkers, but the author offers new insights based on DFT and MD studies that may better explain the processes leading to final tearing failure beneath a diamond nanoindenter...|$|E
