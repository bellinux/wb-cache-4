5|$|Camouflage is an {{important}} defense strategy enabled by changes in body shape, colour and markings.

Others resemble inedible objects, such as twigs or leaves. The larvae of some species, such as the common Mormon and the western tiger swallowtail look like bird droppings.|$|E

5|$|Given the {{superficial}} {{similarities between the}} two flags, the Italian flag and the Mexican flag have been compared over time. However, the Italian tricolour actually uses lighter <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> <b>green</b> and red and the two have different aspect ratios; the Italian flag's aspect ratio is 2:3, while the Mexican flag's aspect ratio of 4:7 results in a more elongated rectangular shape. When Italy became a republic in 1946, the Mexican naval ensign was a plain tricolour; for this reason, on demand of the international naval authorities, Italy could not adopt a sole national flag similar to France as it wished.|$|E

5|$|Numerous cultivars of C.australis {{are sold}} within New Zealand {{and around the}} world. Like other Cordyline species, C.australis can produce sports which have very {{attractive}} colouration, including pink stripes and leaves in various <b>shades</b> <b>of</b> <b>green,</b> yellow or red. An early cultivar was published in France and England in 1870: Cordyline australis 'Lentiginosa' was described as having tinted leaves with brownish red spots. Other early cultivars included 'Veitchii' (1871) with crimson midribs, 'Atrosanguinea' (1882) with bronze leaves infused with red, 'Atropurpurea' (1886) and 'Purpurea' (1890) with purple leaves, {{and a range of}} variegated forms: 'Doucetiana' (1878), 'Argento-striata' (1888) and 'Dalleriana' (1890). In New Zealand and overseas, hybrids with other Cordyline species feature prominently in the range of cultivars available. New Plymouth plant breeders Duncan and Davies included hybrids of C.australis and C.banksii in their 1925 catalogue, and have produced many new cultivars since. In New Zealand, some of the coloured forms and hybrids seem to be more susceptible to attacks from the cabbage tree moth.|$|E
