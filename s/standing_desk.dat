40|$|Prolonged {{sedentary}} {{behavior is}} an independent risk factor for multiple negative health outcomes. Evidence supports introducing <b>standing</b> <b>desks</b> into K- 12 classrooms and work settings to reduce sitting time, but no {{studies have been conducted}} in the college classroom environment. The present study explored the acceptability and feasibility of introducing <b>standing</b> <b>desks</b> in college classrooms. A total of 993 students and 149 instructors completed a single online needs assessment survey. This cross-sectional study was conducted during the fall semester of 2015 at a large Midwestern University. The large majority of students (95 %) reported they would prefer the option to stand in class. Most students (82. 7 %) reported they currently sit during their entire class time. Most students (76. 6 %) and instructors (86. 6 %) reported being in favor of introducing <b>standing</b> <b>desks</b> into college classrooms. More than half of students and instructors predicted having access to <b>standing</b> <b>desks</b> in class would improve student’s “physical health”, “attention”, and “restlessness”. Collectively, these findings support the acceptability of introducing <b>standing</b> <b>desks</b> in college classrooms. Future research is needed to test the feasibility, cost-effectiveness and efficacy of introducing <b>standing</b> <b>desks</b> in college classrooms. Such studies would be useful for informing institutional policies regarding classroom designs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe school {{classroom}} environment often dictates that pupils sit for prolonged periods {{which may be}} detrimental for children's health. Replacing traditional school <b>desks</b> with <b>standing</b> <b>desks</b> may reduce sitting time and provide other benefits. The aim of this systematic review {{was to assess the}} impact of <b>standing</b> <b>desks</b> within the {{school classroom}}. MethodStudies published in English up to and including June 2015 were located from online databases and manual searches. Studies implementing <b>standing</b> <b>desks</b> within the school classroom, including children and/or adolescents (aged 5 – 18 years) which assessed the impact of the intervention using a comparison group or pre–post design were included. ResultsEleven studies were eligible for inclusion; all were set in primary/elementary schools, and most were conducted in the USA (n= 6). Most were non-randomised controlled trials (n= 7), with durations ranging from a single time point to five months. Energy expenditure (measured over 2 h during school day mornings) was the only outcome that consistently demonstrated positive results (three out of three studies). Evidence for the impact of <b>standing</b> <b>desks</b> on sitting, <b>standing,</b> and step counts was mixed. Evidence suggested that implementing <b>standing</b> <b>desks</b> in the classroom environment appears to be feasible, and not detrimental to learning. ConclusionsInterventions utilising <b>standing</b> <b>desks</b> in classrooms demonstrate positive effects in some key outcomes but the evidence lacks sufficient quality and depth to make strong conclusions. Future studies using randomised control trial designs with larger samples, longer durations, with sitting, standing time and academic achievement as primary outcomes, are warranted...|$|R

Mrs. Orme and Lady Mason soon found themselves seated on a bench, with a slight <b>standing</b> <b>desk</b> before them, much as though they were seated in a narrow pew. Up above them, on the same seat, were the three barristers employed on Lady Mason's behalf; nearest to the judge was Mr. Furnival; then came Felix Graham, and below him sat Mr. Chaffanbrass, somewhat out of the line of precedence, in order that he might more easily avail himself of the services of Mr. Aram. Lucius found himself placed next to Mr. Chaffanbrass, and his mother sat between him and Mrs. Orme. On the bench below them, immediately facing a large table which was placed in the centre of the court, sat Mr. Aram and his clerk.|$|E

60|$|They {{who know}} the agonies of an ambitious, indolent, doubting, self-accusing man,--of {{a man who has}} a {{skeleton}} in his cupboard as to which he can ask for sympathy from no one,--will understand what feelings were at work within the bosom of Sir Thomas when his Percycross friends left him alone in his chamber. The moment that {{he knew that he was}} alone he turned the lock of the door, and took from out a <b>standing</b> <b>desk</b> a whole heap of loose papers. These were the latest of his notes on the great Bacon subject. For though no line of the book had ever been written,--nor had his work even yet taken such form as to enable him to write a line,--nevertheless, he always had by him a large assemblage of documents, notes, queries, extracts innumerable, and references which in the course of years had become almost unintelligible to himself, upon which from time to time he would set himself to work. Whenever he was most wretched he would fly at his papers. When the qualms of his conscience became very severe, he would copy some passage from a dusty book, hardly in the belief that it might prove to be useful, but with half a hope that he might cheat himself into so believing. Now, in his misery, he declared that he would bind himself to his work and never leave it. There, if anywhere, might consolation be found.|$|E
6000|$|He {{looked at}} them both for a moment, and could trace much of the lines of that face which he loved so well. But the {{troubles}} of life had almost robbed the elder lady of her beauty; and with the younger, the awkward thinness of {{the last years of}} feminine childhood had not yet given place to the fulfilment of feminine grace. But the likeness in each was quite enough to make him feel that he ought to be at home in that room. He thought that he could love the woman as his mother, and the girl as his sister. He found it very difficult to begin any conversation in their presence, and yet it seemed to be his duty to begin. Mr. Crawley had marshalled him into the room, and having done so, stood aside near the door. Mrs. Crawley had received him very graciously, and having done so, seemed to be ashamed of her own hospitality. Poor Jane had shrunk back into a distant corner, near the open <b>standing</b> <b>desk</b> at which she was accustomed to read Greek to her father, and, of course, could not be expected to speak.

6000|$|... 'The Bishop had {{not lost}} his Eton tastes, and only liked {{to see them}} play games, and the little fat merry-faced lads were always on the {{look-out}} {{for a bit of}} fun with him. One evening a tea-drinking was given in the hall in honour of us. The Mota boys sung in twilight the story of the first arrival of the Mission vessel and of their wonder at it. The air, with a monotonous, not unpleasing refrain, reminded us of some old French Canadian ditties. I remember well the excitement when the Bishop sent up a fire balloon. It sailed slowly towards the sea, and down rushed the whole Melanesian party, shrieking with delight after it. Our dear friend's own quarters were very tiny, and a great contrast to his large airy room at St. John's. He occupied a corner house in the quadrangle, to be close to the boys. Neither bedroom nor sitting-room was more than ten feet square. Everything was orderly, as was his wont. Photographs of the faces and places he loved best hung on the walls. Just by the door was his <b>standing</b> <b>desk,</b> with folios and lexicons. A table, covered with books and papers in divers languages, and a chair or two, completed his stock of furniture. The door stood open all day long in fine weather, and the Bishop was seldom alone. One or other of the boys would steal quietly in and sit down. They {{did not need to be}} amused, nor did they interrupt his work. They were quite content to be near him, and to get now and then a kind word or a pleasant smile. It was the habitual gentle sympathy and friendliness on his part that won the confidence of the wild timid people who had been brought up in an element of mistrust, and which enabled them after a while to come and open their hearts to him.|$|E

60|$|The {{door was}} very low and narrow, {{and seemed to}} be choked up by men with short white surplices, but {{nevertheless}} he found himself inside, jammed among a crowd of Jews; and a sound of many voices, going together in a sing-song wail or dirge, met his ears. His first impulse was to take off his hat, but that was immediately replaced upon his head, he knew not by whom; and then he observed that all within the building were covered. His guide did not follow him, but whispered to some one what it was that the stranger required. He could see that those inside the building were all clothed in muslin shirts of different lengths, and that it was filled with men, all of whom had before them some sort of desk, from which they were reading, or rather wailing out their litany. Though this was the chief synagogue in Prague, and, as being the so-called oldest in Europe, is a building of some consequence in the Jewish world, it was very small. There was no ceiling, and the high-pitched roof, which had once probably been coloured, and the walls, which had once certainly been white, were black with the dirt of ages. In the centre there was a cage, as it were, or iron grille, within which five or six old Jews were placed, who seemed to wail louder than the others. Round the walls there was a row of men inside stationary desks, and outside them another row, before each of whom there was a small movable <b>standing</b> <b>desk,</b> on which there was a portion of the law of Moses. There seemed to be no possible way by which Ziska could advance, and he would have been glad to retreat had retreat been possible. But first one Jew and then another moved their desks for him, so that he was forced to advance, and some among them pointed to the spot where Anton Trendellsohn was standing. But as they pointed, and as they moved their desks to make a pathway, they still sang and wailed continuously, never ceasing for an instant in their long, loud, melancholy song of prayer. At the further end there seemed to be some altar, in front of which the High Priest wailed louder than all, louder even than the old men within the cage; and even he, the High Priest, was forced to move his desk to make way for Ziska. But, apparently without displeasure, he moved it with his left hand, while he swayed his right hand backwards and forwards as though regulating the melody of the wail. Beyond the High Priest Ziska saw Anton Trendellsohn, and close to the son he saw the old man whom he had met in the street, and whom he recognised as Anton's father. Old Trendellsohn seemed to take no notice of him, but Anton had watched him from his entrance, and was prepared to speak to him, though he did not discontinue his part in the dirge till the last moment.|$|E

40|$|Background: It is well {{established}} {{that there are many}} health risks associated with prolonged sedentary time. 1 Unfortunately, research conducted on university students is limited but yet they experience excessive periods of sitting time during class and while studying. Methods: Recently, we investigated the effect of sitting, dynamic sitting, and <b>standing</b> <b>desks</b> on classroom performance of university students. 2 Participants performed three 3 -minute classroom simulations, one {{for each of the three}} desks. The order of the desks and simulations were randomized. Each of the simulations included a different typing and memory task. Results: Results showed no significant difference in the typing or memory tasks. Discussion 2 ̆ 6 Conclusion: The null results provide evidence that short-term classroom performance does not suffer by changing students’ anatomical position from classic sitting. A limitation with this work is that the classroom performance tasks were performed for only 3 minutes under each desk condition. Hence, we are currently repeating the study over a longer ecologically valid university class period of 50 minutes. The null findings of these studies will aid in the recommendation and implementation of dynamic sitting and <b>standing</b> <b>desks</b> in university classrooms thus, allowing university students to obtain health benefits as they learn. Interdisciplinary Reflection: This research combines many disciplines including health science, ergonomics, psychology, and sociology to improve the health and schooling of university students...|$|R

Abstract: <b>Standing</b> <b>desks</b> {{have proven to}} be {{effective}} and viable solutions to combat sedentary behavior among children during the school day in studies around the world. However, little is known regarding the potential of such interventions on cognitive outcomes in children over time. The purpose of this pilot {{study was to determine the}} neurocognitive benefits, i. e., improvements in executive functioning and working memory, of stand-biased desks and explore any associated changes in frontal brain function. 34 freshman high school students were recruited for neurocognitive testing at two time points during the school year: (1) in the fall semester and (2) in the spring semester (after 27. 57 (1. 63) weeks of continued exposure). Executive function and working memory was evaluated using a computerized neurocognitive test battery, and brain activation patterns of the prefrontal cortex were obtained using functional near infrared spectroscopy. Continued utilization of the stand-biased desks was associated with significant improvements in executive function and working memory capabilities. Changes in corresponding brain activation patterns were also observed. These findings provide the first preliminary evidence on the neurocognitive benefits of <b>standing</b> <b>desks,</b> which to date have focused largely on energy expenditure. Findings obtained here can drive future research with larger samples and multiple schools, with comparison groups that may in turn implicate the importance of stand-biased desks, as simple environmental changes in classrooms, on enhancing children’s cognitive functioning that drive their cognitive development and impact educational outcomes...|$|R
