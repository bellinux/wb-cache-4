500|$|Fraser McAlpine of the BBC was {{positive}} {{in his review}} of the song. McAlpine felt that [...] "Dinosaur" [...] was the album's best track, {{and went on to}} note that its conception was enough to [...] "drive rock-bores into a state of <b>spluttering</b> fury." [...] McAlpine's consensus on the song was that [...] "it is made of nothing but sugar and sass and additives, a song from a young girl to an older man who is attempting to pick her up in a club. All she has to offer him is a scattergun spray of insults, and cutie-pie whistling. It’s childish and Parental Advisory Required at the same time, and is going to infuriate any adult within hearing range." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{a stormy}} Cambridge night, Nina lets herself in to an office, {{where she is}} found by Professor Nigel Squires. He is holding a gun, {{but it is not}} loaded. Nina's boyfriend Simon is a fan of cryptic crosswords, but she is never able to help him. She has come to the office of Squires—a classicist who sets crosswords for Varsity as the Sphinx—to seek the answers to the next day's crossword. Squires sets about to teach Nina: [...] "I teach wild {{creature}} without hospital building" [...] results in ARCHITECTURE, which Simon studies. They turn to the clues for the next day, beginning to fill a large grid. Squires uses the name of the Sphinx because she would asphyxiate and consume those who failed to answer her riddle: she was [...] "devious and deadly". Squires makes tea, as Nina looks to his trophies. A picture of Squires with his late wife draws her attention, and they discuss the cut-throat world of competitive crosswording. Nina has answered DOWNANDOUT and WRAP; Squires answers DESI and helps with TRENT. Squires asks about Simon, but catches Nina in a lie; with her excuse being that she only wants to learn. Together, they deduce SWAMPLANDS, meaning [...] "bog". Nina, though, suggests that is should be bogs, otherwise Squires would be cheating. Suddenly <b>spluttering,</b> Squires takes a seat, as Nina begins on the next clue. She suddenly displays clear proficiency, answering ASPHYXIATION.|$|E
500|$|The {{press was}} given an {{opportunity}} to try out the C5 but this proved to be, as Adamson and Kennedy put it, [...] "an unqualified disaster". A large number of the demonstration machines did not work, as the assembled journalists soon discovered. The Sunday Times called the C5 a [...] "Formula One bath-chair"; its reporter [...] "had travelled five yards outdoors when everything when phut and this motorised, plastic, lozenge rolled to a halt with all the stationary decisiveness of a mule". The Guardians reporter had a flat battery after only seven minutes, while Your Computer found that the C5 could not cope with the slopes at Alexandra Palace: [...] "The 250 watt electric motor which drives one of the back wheels proved incapable of powering the C5 up even the gentlest slopes without using pedal power. The tricycle was soon making a plaintive [...] "peep, peep" [...] noise signalling that the engine had overheated." [...] Even the distinguished former racing driver Stirling Moss ran into problems when he tried out the C5 on the roads around Alexandra Palace. The Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail reported that while he had started out well, [...] "a jaunty smile on [...] face as he braved some of the worst exhaust fumes in the world <b>spluttering</b> almost directly into his face from trucks he could almost drive underneath", he ran into problems when he reached a hill: [...] "It was at this point that he realised the battery had gone dead. On a cold and foggy London day, the great man was visibly sweating." ...|$|E

2500|$|The buzzing {{sound of}} the V-1's pulse jet engine was likened by some to [...] "a motor cycle in bad running order". As it reached its target and dived, the {{sound of the}} {{propulsion}} unit <b>spluttering</b> and cutting out, followed by an eerie hush before impact, was quite terrifying, though the silence was also a warning to seek shelter (later V-1s were corrected to have the originally-intended power dive). [...] At least one business in London advertised how quickly a patron could access a nearby shelter. Despite this, the cloudy and rainy conditions of June and July aided the effectiveness of the weapon and casualties were high. By late August {{a million and a half}} people had left London and the rate of work production was affected. By the late summer and autumn, however, increasingly effective countermeasures against the V-1 were taken and people started returning to London.|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{completion}} of the coroners court the Chief Inspector of Accidents opened an enquiry on 24 February. Evidence was taken from the surviving passengers and crew and baggage loaders. The co-pilot explained that the aircraft had just been delivered from the United States to Heathrow Airport following the purchase by Spencer. It had been ferried to Croydon the day before the accident and the long-range fuel tanks had been removed and the seats fitted. Preparing the aircraft had taken all day and night and Spencer was said to have had only two hours sleep. In the morning the starboard engine had a lack of pressure but the co-pilot and the radio operator said before the flight that it was OK. Another witness gave evidence that the wings were covered in snow and he had not seen any attempt to defrost the aircraft. A statement given by an inspector of police from Northern Rhodesia attested to the fact that Spencer did not smoke or drink and had many hours flying experience since the early 1930s. Following the statement about Spencer's lack of sleep the counsel representing the next-of-kin of Captain Spencer made a formal protest that they {{had not been able to}} question the statement. The inquiry was closed on 28 February following technical evidence and a statement from an aircraft engineer who had witnessed that the starboard engine had been in [...] "a bad state" [...] and was popping and <b>spluttering</b> before the aircraft had taken off.|$|E
2500|$|She {{released}} a second book in 2003, titled Sacred Evil: Encounters with the Unknown. The book, which was previously known as Good and Evil, chronicled nine case studies during {{her life as}} a Wiccan healer and gives explanations as to why those events happened. To promote the book, Chakraverti held a healing session at Oxford Bookstore in Kolkata, where she read excerpts from the book, and gave demonstration of her healing skills, holding the hand of a volunteer, tapping her with her athame (wand) and reciting Egyptian chants. After its release, the book received positive reaction from critics. Rajdeep Bains from The Tribune commented [...] "Sacred Evil is a very coherent account of the author’s dealings with witchcraft and sorcery. Unfortunately, it could add to superstition, which is already prevalent at an unhealthy level in our country. As a work of fiction it would have been laudable; given the cover of truth it becomes a dangerous piece of writing. [...] But what makes Sacred Evil so interesting is the juxtaposition of modern thought with the ageless. After every chapter there are notes on the practices described in it along with modern explanations." [...] Krithika Ranjan from The Hindu commented, [...] "Throughout [...] Chakraverti refers to herself as a skeptic. Yet the stories she tells are bound to raise the ire of [...] rationalists. You can almost hear one <b>spluttering</b> about superstition as you read the story Those who return. [...] In the final analysis, the book is a good read— whether you believe in the dark arts or whether you just want to curl up with a spine chiller." [...] Chakraverti started working on her third book, tentatively titled Every Strong Woman is a Witch.|$|E
