Screening of ESBL producers {{was done with}} the help of Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing, Phenotypic Confirmatory Disc Diffusion <b>Test,</b> Double Disc <b>Synergy</b> <b>Test</b> and E- Test. Determination of minimum inhibitory concentration of 3 rd generation cephalosporins, highlighted 37 ESBL producers to be either sensitive, or exhibit intermediate resistance to ceftazidime, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime. This indicates difficulty in routine ESBL detection where MIC is generally carried out as a screening step for ESBL detection. All ESBL producers showed presence of plasmid of approximately 50 - 60 kb in size. Confirmation of ESBL production was done by PCR amplification which showed presence of blaTEM (742 bp) gene in 156 out of 167 ESBL producers, blaCTX-M (413 bp) gene in 63 / 167 and blaAmpC (346 bp) gene in 108 / 167 ESBL producers.

Methods: ESBL production was assayed using Double Discs <b>Synergy</b> <b>Test</b> (DDST). Antimicrobial susceptibility was performed by Modified Kirby-Baeur method with the organism tested against ceftazidime (30 µg), cefotaxime (30 µg), amoxicillin-clavulinic acid (20 / 10 µg), cefepime (30 µg), ciprofloxacin (5 µg), gentamicin (10 µg), trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (23. 75 / 1. 25 µg), imipenem (10 µg) and doripenem (10 µg) (Oxoid, UK). Results: Fifty (26. 7 %) of the 187 Klebsiellae studied were EPK comprising of 37 (26. 8 %) Klebsiella pneumoniae and 13 (26. 5 %) Klebsiella oxytoca. EPK were mostly from wound specimens (24. 0 %) although Klebsiellae were mostly occurring in sputum (26. 2 %).

40|$|Detection of β-lactamase was {{performed}} by the Masuda Test, the Double Disc <b>Synergy</b> <b>Test</b> (DDST), and a novel test developed {{during the course of}} this work for ESBL as follows: Serial dilutions of antibiotics against which enzyme activity is to be demonstrated are incorporated into Mueller-Hinton agar containing methylumbeliferyl-β-D-glucuronide (MUG) 70 μg/mL. Growth of Escherichia coli on this medium gives fluorescence but growth of K. pneumoniae does not. These plates are seeded with an E. coli lawn and K. pneumoniae strains are spot inoculated by Steers Replicator onto the lawn. At antibiotic concentrations above the MIC of E. coli, fluorescence on the lawn is inhibited. On the same plates, satellite growth of E. coli occurs around enzyme-producing K. pneumoniae isolates and this is manifested as a ring of fluorescence. The incorporation into the medium of clavulanic acid indicates if the enzyme is neutralized. In the Series I the K. pneumoniae isolates positive by DDST were also positive by the satellite fluorescence test. None of the isolates were positive by DDST and negative by fluorescence testing. Conclusions are (1) Routine susceptibility tests do not detect ESBL in K. pneumoniae isolates which may be clinically important. (2) The satellite fluorescence test is a more sensitive test than the DDST. (3) This fluorescence test is a convenient, flexible, and sensitive test for screening ESBL production in K. pneumoniae isolates.

It can present clinically in two major forms: Acute Otitis Media (AOM) and Otitis Media with Effusion (OME) and {{it is one of the}} leading cause of hospital visits and antibiotic prescriptions amongst children and even adults. Antibiotic resistance is a global public health problem and Extended Spectrum Î²-Lactamase (ESBL) enzymes is one of the new mechanisms of resistance in especially Gram negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. ESBLs are plasmid-mediated Î²-lactamase enzymes that hydrolyze extended-spectrum oxyimino 3 rd generation cephalosporins and monobactams. Organisms producing ESBLs have remained important nosocomial and community-acquired pathogens over the years. Ear swab specimens of children (aged 0 - 7) with suspected Otitis media infections and who attended a tertiary hospital in Enugu, Nigeria were cultured on growth media. E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa were isolated and identified by standard microbiological techniques. Antibiogram was conducted on all isolated ear pathogens by Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method and ESBL production was evaluated by the Double Disk <b>Synergy</b> <b>Test</b> (DDST) method. Imipenem and meropenem were the most active antibiotics against the E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa ear pathogens.

Resistance to broad-spectrum β-lactams, mediated by extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) and AmpC β-lactamase enzymes is fast spreading {{and has had}} negative impacts on the clinical outcomes, particularly on third-generation cephalosporins. This study investigated the carriage of AmpC gene among multidrug-resistant Salmonella spp. from Lagos, Nigeria. Methods: Forty Salmonella spp. from clinical samples (S. typhi = 13; S. typhimurium = 10; S. enteritidis = 8; S. choleraesuis = 5; S. paratyphi = 4) were subjected to in vitro susceptibility test by disk diffusion methods. Isolates that were resistant to cefoxitin and third-generation cephalosporins were screened for ESBL (Double Disk <b>Synergy</b> <b>Test</b> Method) and AmpC enzyme (AmpC disk test) production. Detection of AmpC fox gene {{was carried out by}} polymerase chain reaction. Results: Thirty-two (80 %) of the Salmonella isolates were cefoxitin resistant. Plasmid-mediated AmpC β-lactamase and ESBL enzymes were recorded in 10 / 40 (25 %) and 16 / 40 (40 %) of the Salmonella isolates, respectively. Specifically, 16 / 40 (40 %) of the Salmonella isolates possessed 380 bp AmpC fox gene, with the highest occurrence found in S. typhi strains (43. 8 %) followed by S. typhimurium (25 %). There was no AmpC fox gene detected in S. paratyphi strains. Interestingly, coproduction of enzymes occurred in some of the isolates, raising fears of resistance to a multitude of antibiotics in the treatment of bacterial infections. Conclusion: Emergence of AmpC β-lactamase–producing Salmonella isolates in our environment was recorded for the first time, raising concern on increased antibiotic resistance among strains of Salmonella serovars in Lagos. Further genotypic study of the isolates could answer the questions on strain sources, clonal relatedness, and mechanism of spread.

40|$|Adoptive {{transfer}} of antigen-specific CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells {{is one of}} the most efficient forms of cancer immunotherapy. However, the isolation of antigen-specific CD 4 + T cells is limited because only few tumor-associated helper epitopes are identified. Here, we used T cell antigen receptor gene transfer to target CD 4 + T cells against an MHC class I-presented epitope of a model tumor antigen. IFN-γ-producing CD 4 + T cells were unable to expand in vivo and to provide help for tumor rejection. In contrast, CD 4 + T cells producing high levels of IL- 2 expanded in vivo, provided help for cytotoxic T lymphocyte-mediated tumor rejection, and developed T cell memory. The data demonstrate in vivo <b>synergy</b> between <b>T</b> cell antigen receptor-transduced CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells specific for the same epitope resulting in long-term tumor protection...|$|R
40|$|Notch receptors are {{processed}} by bold gamma-secretase acting in <b>synergy</b> with <b>T</b> cell receptor signaling to sustain peripheral T cell activation. Activated CD 4 + T cells differentiate into T helper type 1 (TH 1) or TH 2 subsets. Molecular cues directing TH 1 differentiation include {{expression of the}} TH 1 -specific transcription factor T-bet, encoded by Tbx 21. However, the regulation of Tbx 21 remains incompletely defined. Here we report that Notch 1 can directly regulate Tbx 21 through complexes formed on the Tbx 21 promoter. In vitro, bold gamma-secretase inhibitors extinguished expression of Notch, interferon-bold gamma and Tbx 21 in TH 1 -polarized CD 4 + cells, whereas ectopic expression of activated Notch 1 restored Tbx 21 transcription. In vivo, administration of bold gamma-secretase inhibitors substantially impeded TH 1 -mediated disease progression in the mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of multiple sclerosis. Thus, using bold gamma-secretase inhibitors to modulate Notch signaling may prove beneficial in treating TH 1 -mediated autoimmunity...|$|R

40|$|Human B- and T-lymphocyte {{preparations}} {{were isolated}} by separating T lymphocytes that formed rosettes with sheep erythrocytes from unrosetted B lymphocytes. Pokeweed mitogen stimulates {{the proliferation of}} both B- and T-lymphocyte preparations. In contrast, phytohaemagglutinin stimulates little or no proliferation of purified B lymphocytes although it stimulates the proliferation of T lymphocytes. Lymphoid preparations containing both T and B lymphocytes are more responsive to both mitogens than are either T- or B-lymphocyte preparations. This observation suggested <b>synergy</b> between <b>T</b> and B lymphocytes in the response of unfractionated lymphocytes to mitogens. The basis for this synergy was shown to be the capacity of T lymphocytes to facilitate the proliferation of B lymphocytes cultured with pokeweed mitogen or phytohaemagglutinin. The activity of T lymphocytes is not dependent upon their proliferation or attributable to their release of mitogenic factors. With regard to the clinical evaluation of immune function, our {{results indicate that the}} proliferative response of human lymphocytes to phytohaemagglutinin or pokeweed mitogen cannot be directly related to the percentage of T lymphocytes in the lymphoid preparation...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss how}} the lepton CP phase can be {{constrained}} by accelerator and reactor measurements {{in an era}} without dedicated experiments for CP violation search. To characterize globally the sensitivity to the CP phase δ CP, we use the CP exclusion fraction, which quantifies what fraction of the δ CP space can be excluded at given input values of θ 23 and δ CP. Using the measure we study the CP sensitivity which may be possessed by the accelerator experiments T 2 K and NO ν A. We show that, if the mass hierarchy is known, T 2 K and NO ν A alone may exclude, respectively, about 50 %- 60 % and 40 %- 50 % of the δ CP space at 90 % CL by 10 years running, provided that a considerable fraction of beam time {{is devoted to the}} antineutrino run. The <b>synergy</b> between <b>T</b> 2 K and NO ν A is remarkable, leading to the determination of the mass hierarchy through CP sensitivity at the same CL...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{knowledge}} of the sea ice parameters, including the thickness and the snow depth over sea ice, are key to both climate change studies and operational forecast in polar regions. The estimation of these parameters mainly relies on satellite based remote sensing, and current retrieval algorithms usually focus on the retrieval of a single parameter under simple assumptions over the other. In this article, we explore the potential of combined retrieval of both sea ice thickness and snow depth through the data synergy two types of concurrent observations of the sea ice cover: the active altimetry and the L-band passive remote sensing. The data synergy is based on two physical constrains: (1) L-band (1. 4 GHz) radiation model for the sea ice cover, and (2) the hydrostatic equilibrium as used in satellite altimetry. Two schemes of data synergy are proposed: (1) the synergy between L-band brightness temperature (T B) from passive microwave remote sensing and sea ice freeboard (F B i c e) as measured by radar altimetry, and (2) the <b>synergy</b> between L-band <b>T</b> B and snow freeboard (F B s n o w) as measured by laser altimetry. Based on retrievability studies, we show that both parameters can be retrieved using {{the two sets of}} data. Specifically, we show that there is potential problem of ill-posedness for the <b>synergy</b> between L-band <b>T</b> B and F B s n o w, with two possible retrieval solutions for {{a small portion of the}} solution space. On the other hand, the <b>synergy</b> between L-band <b>T</b> B and F B i c e is always well-posed. In terms of sensitivity, lower uncertainty is witnessed for thin ice for the retrieval with F B i c e, while the retrieval with F B s n o w shows advantage for thick ice. Besides the input parameters of T B, F B i c e and F B s n o w, the uncertainty associated with certain model parameters such as snow and ice densities is not negligible for the uncertainty estimation of the retrieved parameters. Verification is carried out with observational data from Operation IceBridge (OIB) campaigns and SMOS satellite, showing that both sea ice thickness and snow depth can be attained by the proposed retrieval algorithms. These algorithms serve as the basis for large-scale retrieval with satellite remote sensing data, including concurrent observation of the Arctic Ocean by independent satellite campaigns such as SMOS, CryoSat- 2 and ICESat...|$|R
40|$|Proper {{development}} {{of the immune system}} is an intricate process dependent on many fac-tors, including an intact DNA damage response. The DNA double-strand break signaling kinase ATM and its cofactor NBS 1 are required during T cell development and for the main-tenance of genomic stability. The role of a second ATM cofactor, ATMIN (also known as ASCIZ) in T cells is much less clear, and whether ATMIN and NBS 1 function in <b>synergy</b> in <b>T</b> cells is unknown. Here, we investigate the roles of ATMIN and NBS 1, either alone or in com-bination, using murine models. We show loss of NBS 1 led to a developmental block at the double-positive stage of T cell development, as well as reduced TCRα recombination, that was unexpectedly neither exacerbated nor alleviated by concomitant loss of ATMIN. In con-trast, loss of both ATMIN and NBS 1 enhanced DNA damage that drove spontaneous peripheral T cell hyperactivation, proliferation as well as excessive production of proinflam-matory cytokines and chemokines, leading to a highly inflammatory environment. Intrigu-ingly, the disease causing T cells were largely proficient for both ATMIN and NBS 1. In vivo this resulted in severe intestinal inflammation, colitis and premature death. Our finding...|$|R
40|$|The Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent {{protein kinase}} (CaMK) type IV/Gr is {{selectively}} expressed in T lymphocytes and is activated after signaling via the T cell antigen receptor (TCR), indicating that it mediates {{some of the}} Ca 2 +-dependent transcriptional events that follow TCR engagement. Here we show that CaMKIV/Gr induces the transcription factor activation protein 1 (AP- 1) alone or in <b>synergy</b> with <b>T</b> cell mitogens and with the p 21 ra ~ oncoprotein. CaMKIV/ Gr signaling is associated with transcriptional activation of c-fos but is independent of p 21 ~ or calcineurin. AP- 1 is an integral component of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcriptional complex, which is required for interleukin 2 gene expression in T cells. We demonstrate that CaMKIV/Gr reconstitutes {{the capacity of the}} cytosolic component of NFAT to direct transcription from NFAT sites in non-T cells. These results reveal a central role for CaMKIV/Gr as a Ca 2 +-regulated activator of gene transcription in T lymphocytes. C a 2 + signaling pathways play a particularly important role in lymphocyte biology. Elevation of free intracellular Ca 2 § concentrations after engagement of lymphocyte antigen receptors is required for a broad array of events i...|$|R

Whilst fully conditioned Granger causality is not affected by synergy, the pairwise analysis fails to put in evidence synergetic effects. We show that maximization of the total Granger causality to a given target, over all the possible partitions of the set of driving variables, puts in evidence redundant multiplets of variables influencing the target, provided that an unnormalized definition of Granger causality is adopted. Along the same lines we also introduce a pairwise index of <b>synergy</b> (w. r. <b>t.</b> to information flow to a third variable) which is zero when two independent sources additively influence a common target; thus, this definion differs from previous definitions of synergy...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{autoimmune}} encephalomyelitis (EAE) induced in the rat by {{active immunization}} with myelin-oligodendrocyte-glycoprotein (MOG) is mediated by <b>synergy</b> between MOG-specific <b>T</b> cells and demyelinating MOG-specific antibody responses. The resulting disease is chronic and displays demyelinating {{central nervous system}} (CNS) pathology that closely resembles multiple sclerosis. We analyzed major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotype influences on this disease. The MHC haplotype does not exert an all-or-none effect on disease susceptibility. Rather, it determines the degree of disease susceptibility, recruitment of MOG-specific immunocompetent cells, clinical course, and CNS pathology in a hierarchical and allele-specific manner. Major haplotype-specific effects on MOG-EAE map to the MHC class II gene region, but this effect is modified by other MHC genes. In addition, non-MHC genes directly influence both disease and T cell functions, such as the secretion of IFN-gamma. Thus, in MOG-EAE, allelic MHC class II effects are graded, strongly modified by other MHC genes, and overcome by effects of non-MHC genes and environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of an immune based graft-versus-leukaemia (GvL) effect highlighted the prospect of managing relapsed leukaemias with T cell-based adoptive immunotherapy. Thus, various strategies have been explored for the in vitro expansion of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) -specific T cells. In a popular approach, AML blasts have been genetically modified to express co-stimulatory molecules essential for effective T cell priming. One such tactic has been the modification of AML cells to express the B 7 /CD 80 co-stimulatory molecule that binds to CD 28 on T cells initiating events that culminate in enhanced cytokine production, proliferation and development of effector functions by T cells. The success of these strategies has been limited by difficulties in attaining sufficient transduction efficiencies and associated high levels of CD 80 expression. We demonstrate that these problems can be circumvented by using anti-CD 28 monoclonal antibody. Furthermore, we show that the synergistic relationship between CD 80 /CD 28 pathway and interleukin 12 cytokine (IL- 12), documented in the generation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) for solid tumours, also applies to AML. CD 28 /IL- 12 synergy facilitated the proliferation of allogeneic T cells in response to stimulation with primary AML blasts. The synergy also favoured generation of a Th 1 -type immune response, evidenced by gamma interferon (IFN-γ) secretion and facilitated naive and memory T cell proliferation. Unlike some methods of in vitro T cell expansion, use of CD 28 /IL- 12 <b>synergy</b> left <b>T</b> cells in the physiologically appropriate CD 45 RA–/CCR 7 – subsets known {{to be associated with}} immediate cytotoxic functions...|$|R
