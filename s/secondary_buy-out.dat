40|$|Abstract: Management buy-outs {{have become}} a global phenomenon. This paper {{examines}} the key market trends in the UK and Continental Europe and identifies challenges for the future development of the market. Key recent trends include: buy-out funds raised have exceeded funds invested; evidence from Continental Europe indicates an intention by institutional investors to increase their commitment; private equity firms from the United States have become more prominent investors in European buy-outs; increased competition has come from hedge funds and new entrants such as government-sponsored operators, family offices and wealthy entrepreneurs; major changes in deals have been the growth of <b>secondary</b> <b>buy-outs</b> and public-to-private buy-outs; recent lower interest rates {{have been associated with}} a rise in debt; size of deal syndicates is increasing in very large deals; average share price reaction to the PTP announcement in the UK during 1997 - 2003 was 30 %; <b>secondary</b> <b>buy-outs</b> {{have become a}}n important exit route, and there is an increasing number of tertiary or quaternary buy-outs. Future challenges include: realizing the scope for attractive deals from restructuring larger corporations in Continental Europe; encouraging succession planning that will result in buy-outs involving family-owned firms; further differentiation between private equity firms in order to generate upside gains; addressing the competitive challenge to existing financiers from hedge funds; reconciling concerns about the medium term economic performance of European economies and the degree of leverage in <b>buy-out</b> deals; and <b>secondary</b> <b>buy-outs</b> raise major challenges relating to whether managers are buyers or sellers, and the attitudes of limited partners.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we provide a {{description}} of secondary buy-outs mechanisms, and their evolution in regards to first round buy-outs. While some additional motives are identified, introducing the possibility of performance improvement through the change in ownership structure, we analyse the evolution of some performance indicators. We scanned a 6, 633 UK secondary buy-outs database between 2000 and August 2010, as to identify a 108 -exited <b>secondary</b> <b>buy-out</b> sample (2000 - 2009 period). We find conclusive evidence that operating performance, profitability and return on investment changes from first round buy-outs to secondary buy-outs are negative. However secondary buy- outs still out-perform industry peers. Positive influence of private equity backing remains in secondary buy-outs. Nevertheless similar impact of private equity syndication is limited – it only seems to significantly increase resort to leverage. We also identified – in a limited extent – the negative first round buy-outs’ length relationship and the positive secondary buy-outs’ length relationship with secondary buy-outs performance indicator. This suggests that exit through secondary buy-outs only takes place if neither flotation nor trade sale are possible. In addition, the more time allowed for <b>secondary</b> <b>buy-out</b> mechanisms implementation, the greater operating performance and profitability improvements...|$|E

At this point, the National Computing Centre sold its shares in NCC Group as did Pearse, Bird and Sadler who left the business.

40|$|Since years, {{incentives}} {{for the management}} have become a standard upon acquisitions of companies by Private Equity Investors - so-called Buy-Outs. However, until this date there are no empirical studies available on the arrangements of management participations and potential conflicts of interest especially on occasion of sales from one Private Equity Investor to another - so-called <b>Secondary</b> <b>Buy-Outs.</b> This present study {{is based on a}} survey among Private Equity Investors and Management Teams in companies controlled by Private Equity Investors. It shows a high degree of sensibility of all parties concerned for the issue of incentives and the potential conflict of interest involved with it. It also showed that market standards for management incentives have developed in the meantime. In practice, the instrument to prevent conflicts is therefore the transparency of the transaction. The only way to prevent criminal and civil consequences (damages) for the managers involved, as well as obstructing or even frustrating the process as a whole, is an open and transparent communication about the selling process and possible concepts of incentives between all parties concerned, i. e. seller, buyer and the management involved. Despite the frequency of such transactions there are - until today - no market standards or guide lines for this necessary transparency. The present study intends to create initial groundwork for this.

40|$|The aim of our {{research}} is to give {{an update on the}} research of Ball et al. (2008), and to carry on studying the statistical overview of the buy-outs/ins in family firms. In this respect, we have also compared the statistical overview of the buy-outs/ins in family firms to all buy-outs/ins. Secondly, with the inspiration from Migel et al. (2009), we examine how different factors (e. g. the source of buy-outs, the involvement of private equity investors and the type of buy-outs) affect the value creation in post-buyout companies. As such, we have a particular focus on how these factors influence the value creation in post-buyout of family firms. The first phase of {{our research}} is based on the review of literature which forms the foundation and inspiration for our research and enhances our understanding of the key objectives we set forth in our research. Then we move forward to the second phase {{of our research}}: collecting data, analyzing and interpreting the data set and using statistical testing to obtain a real picture of our research data and to our hypotheses against it. After thorough examination of the research questions and the hypotheses, we found that value creation in post buy-outs was independent on the source of the buy-out (e. g. divestment, family firms, <b>secondary</b> <b>buy-outs</b> and other). Secondly, we found that value creation in post buy-outs of family firms was higher in VC backed deals than non VC backed deals, and that in the short term more value is added in VC backed deals than in non VC backed deals (exit within 5 years). Furthermore, the value added in VC backed deals is higher in the short term (exit within 5 years) than the long term (exit after 5 years). Finally, we observed that the value creation in post buy-outs of family firms is generally higher in a management buy-out than a management buy-in deal...|$|R
