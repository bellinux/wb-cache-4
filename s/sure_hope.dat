500|$|Continuing their travels, the two {{come across}} a {{universe}} where singer and performer Frank Sinatra was never born, resulting {{in the loss of}} the 1960 presidential election by President John F. Kennedy to then-Vice President Richard Nixon, which causes World War III. Brian questions whether Lee Harvey Oswald shot Kennedy, and Stewie responds that he shot Mayor McCheese instead. A sequence similar to the Zapruder film, which shows the assassination of Kennedy, is shown, with Jacqueline Kennedy also appearing. Brian and Stewie next discover a universe completely depicted as a political cartoon. The next reference occurs in the dog universe when Stewie says, [...] "Take your stinking paws off me you damn, dirty dog!" [...] which is a reference to the famous quote [...] "Take your stinking paws off me you damn, dirty ape!" [...] from the first Planet of the Apes movie. The final reference of the episode also occurs in the dog universe when Stewie mentions, [...] "Gosh, Brian, I <b>sure</b> <b>hope</b> this next leap, will be the leap home," [...] a nod to the opening narration of the time travel series Quantum Leap.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2015, while {{promoting}} his second solo album Cauterize, Mark Tremonti claimed {{in an interview}} with Kerrang that he [...] " [...] been a close friend of Scott's in 9 years". He said that Stapp believed that the other members would end Alter Bridge and perform solely with him in Creed, which they didn't wish to do, as they had established a unique foundation in that band. The other members did not speak to Stapp throughout the South American Tour in 2012 and plans for their fifth studio album were shelved, and they continued to work with Myles Kennedy in Alter Bridge. [...] In August 2015, Tremonti reiterated that there were no plans for Creed {{for at least the next}} few years, but he didn't rule out the possibility. [...] In September 2015, Stapp appeared on the Dr. Oz Show and recounted his history with depression and drug use, and how they contributed to mental health scare in November. [...] When asked about a Creed reunion, Stapp replied: [...] "I can tell you what, I <b>sure</b> <b>hope</b> so. I love the guys with all my heart and if they’re watching, 'Come on guys, let’s make a record.'" [...] He later doubled down on the statements by stating that Creed would [...] "definitely" [...] reunite and that he expected new material from the band within [...] "the next two years." [...] When asked about Stapp's statements, Tremonti clarified that he was still busy {{promoting his}} solo albums and that Alter Bridge would record and tour in 2016, making it unlikely for him to return to Creed within Stapp's proposed timeline.|$|E

6000|$|... 2 How delightfully but solemnly is this {{illustrated}} in the [...] "Pilgrim's Progress." [...] The wicket-gate, {{at the head of}} the way, at which the poor burdened sinner must knock and obtain an entrance by Christ the door. It may be like Mercy, with a trembling but <b>sure</b> <b>hope.</b> And then the glorious entrance into the Celestial City itself, after crossing the river which has no bridge. This was opened to Christian, but shut against Ignorance and against Turnaway of the Town of Apostasy.--Ed.|$|E
60|$|And now, {{where are}} Mandat's Squadrons {{that were to}} charge? Not a Squadron of them stirs: or they stir in the wrong direction, out of the way; their {{officers}} glad that they will even do that. It is to this hour uncertain whether the Squadron on the Pont Neuf made the shadow of resistance, or {{did not make the}} shadow: enough, the blackbrowed Marseillese, and Saint-Marceau following them, do cross without let; do cross, in <b>sure</b> <b>hope</b> now of Saint-Antoine and the rest; do billow on, towards the Tuileries, where their errand is. The Tuileries, at sound of them, rustles responsive: the red Swiss look to their priming; Courtiers in black draw their blunderbusses, rapiers, poniards, some have even fire-shovels; every man his weapon of war.|$|E

60|$|Wordsworth, as {{he turned}} over one leaf after another, said, 'But I shall weary you, sir.' 'By no means,' said I; for I could have been content to stand there for hours to hear, as I did, the Poet read from time to time, with fitting emphasis, the choice {{passages}} which your preface and biographical sketch contain. Imagine with what delight I listened to the venerable man, and to hear, too, from his own lips, such words as these, your own most true reflection: 'His has been a life devoted to the cultivation of the poet's art for its best and most lasting uses--a self-dedication as complete as {{the world has ever}} witnessed.' Your remark with regard to his having outlived many of his contemporaries among the poets, he read with affecting simplicity; his manner being that of one who looked backward to the past with entire tranquillity, and forward with <b>sure</b> <b>hope.</b> I felt that his honoured life was drawing rapidly to a close, and with him there was evidently the same consciousness.|$|E
60|$|Most of {{the topics}} I have used are drawn from fear and apprehension. Topics derived from fear or {{addressed}} to it are, I well know, of doubtful appearance. To be <b>sure,</b> <b>hope</b> is in general the incitement to action. Alarm some men,--you do not drive them {{to provide for their}} security; you put them to a stand; you induce them, not to take measures to prevent the approach of danger, but to remove so unpleasant an idea from their minds; you persuade them to remain as they are, from a new fear that their activity may bring on the apprehended mischief before its time. I confess freely that this evil sometimes happens from an overdone precaution; but it is when the measures are rash, ill-chosen, or ill-combined, and the effects rather of blind terror than of enlightened foresight. But the few to whom I wish to submit my thoughts are of a character which will enable them to see danger without astonishment, and to provide against it without perplexity.|$|E

6000|$|The beardless inquisitors, {{organised}} into little regiments, doubtless took {{to their work}} very willingly. To coerce people by shame, or other spiritual pelting, into the giving up of things it will probably vex them to part with, {{is a form of}} piety to which the boyish mind is most readily converted; and if some obstinately wicked men got enraged and threatened the whip or the cudgel, this also was exciting. Savonarola himself evidently felt about the training of these boys the difficulty weighing on all minds with noble yearnings towards great ends, yet with that imperfect perception of means which forces a resort to some supernatural constraining influence as the only <b>sure</b> <b>hope.</b> The Florentine youth had had very evil habits and foul tongues: it seemed at first an unmixed blessing when they were got to shout [...] "Viva Gesu!" [...] But Savonarola was forced at last to say from the pulpit, [...] "There is a little too much shouting of `Viva Gesu!' This constant utterance of sacred words brings them into contempt. Let me have no more of that shouting till the next Festa." ...|$|E
6000|$|A third difficulty, privately more {{stringent}} than any, {{is that of}} Finance. The expenses of the late Bohemian Expedition, [...] "Friedrich's Army costing 75,000 pounds a month," [...] have been excessive. For our next Campaign, {{if it is to}} be done in the way essential, there are, by rigorous arithmetic, [...] "900,000 pounds" [...] needed. A frugal Prussia raises no new taxes; pays its Wars from [...] "the Treasure," [...] from the Fund saved beforehand for emergencies of that kind; Fund which is running low, threatening to be at the lees if such drain on it continue. To fight with effect being the one <b>sure</b> <b>hope,</b> and salve for all sores, it is not in the Army, in the Fortresses, the Fighting Equipments, that there shall be any flaw left! Friedrich's budget is a sore problem upon him; needing endless shift and ingenuity, now and onwards, through this war:--already, during these months, in the Berlin Schloss, a great deal of those massive Friedrich-Wilhelm plate Sumptuosities, especially that unparalleled Music-Balcony up stairs, all silver, has been, under Fredersdorf's management, quietly taken away; [...] "carried over, in the night-time, to the Mint." [...] [Orlich, ii. 126-128.] ...|$|E
6000|$|Poor Louis is {{not without}} insight, nor even without the {{elements}} of will; some sharpness of temper, spurting at times from a stagnating character. If harmless inertness could save him, it were well; but he will slumber and painfully dream, and to do aught is not given him. Royalist Antiquarians still shew the rooms where Majesty and suite, in these extraordinary circumstances, had their lodging. Here sat the Queen; reading,--for she had her library brought hither, though the King refused his; taking vehement counsel of the vehement uncounselled; sorrowing over altered times; yet with <b>sure</b> <b>hope</b> of better: in her young rosy Boy, has she not the living emblem of hope! It is a murky, working sky; yet with golden gleams--of dawn, or of deeper meteoric night? Here again this chamber, {{on the other side}} of the main entrance, was the King's: here his Majesty breakfasted, and did official work; here daily after breakfast he received the Queen; sometimes in pathetic friendliness; sometimes in human sulkiness, for flesh is weak; and, when questioned about business would answer: [...] "Madame, your business is with the children." [...] Nay, Sire, were it not better you, your Majesty's self, took the children? So asks impartial History; scornful that the thicker vessel was not also the stronger; pity-struck for the porcelain-clay of humanity rather than for the tile-clay,--though indeed both were broken! ...|$|E

6000|$|Oh, come to {{that table}} this day, and there claim your share in the most {{precious}} body and blood of the Divine Child of Bethlehem.

So {{you will be able to}} govern yourselves, and your own appetites, in righteousness and freedom, and rule your own households, or whatsoever God has set you to do, in judgment. So you will see things in their true light, as God sees them, and be ready and willing to hear good advice, and understand your way in this life, and be able to speak your hearts out in prayer to God, as to a loving and merciful Father. And in all your afflictions, let them be what they will, you will have a comfort, and a <b>sure</b> <b>hope,</b> and a wellspring of peace, and a hiding-place from the tempest, even The Man Christ Jesus, who said: [...] "Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you; let not your heart be troubled, neither be ye afraid." [...] The Man Christ Jesus, at whose birth the angels sang: [...] "Glory to God in the Highest, and on earth peace, good-will toward men." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{must not}} be omitted, {{that there was a}} {{fragrance}} in the room, which, unlike as the scene was, brought back, through so many years, to Redclyffe's mind a most vivid remembrance of poor old Doctor Grim's squalid chamber, with his wild, bearded presence in the midst of it, puffing his everlasting cloud; for here was the same smell of tobacco, and on the mantel-piece of a chimney lay a German pipe, and an old silver tobacco-box into which was wrought the leopard's head and the inscription in black letter. The Warden had evidently availed himself of one of the chief bachelor sources of comfort. Redclyffe, whose destiny had hitherto, and up to a very recent period, been to pass a feverishly active life, was greatly impressed by all these tokens of learned ease,--a degree of self-indulgence combined with duties enough to quiet an otherwise uneasy conscience,--by the consideration that this pensioner acted a good part in a world where no one is entitled to be an unprofitable laborer. He thought within himself, that his prospects in his own galvanized country, that seemed to him, a few years since, to offer such a career for an adventurous young man, conscious of motive power, had nothing so enticing as such a nook as this,--a quiet recess of unchangeable old time, around which the turbulent tide now eddied and rushed, but could not disturb it. Here, to be <b>sure,</b> <b>hope,</b> love, ambition, came not, progress came not; but here was what, just now, the early wearied American could appreciate better than aught else,--here was rest.|$|E
60|$|First, The Ring, {{with all}} its gods and giants and dwarfs, its water-maidens and Valkyries, its wishing-cap, magic ring, enchanted sword, and miraculous treasure, is a drama of today, and not of a remote and fabulous antiquity. It {{could not have been}} written before {{the second half of the}} nineteenth century, because it deals with events which were only then consummating themselves. Unless the spectator recognizes in it an image of the life he is himself {{fighting}} his way through, it must needs appear to him a monstrous development of the Christmas pantomimes, spun out here and there into intolerable lengths of dull conversation by the principal baritone. Fortunately, even from this point of view, The Ring is full of extraordinarily attractive episodes, both orchestral and dramatic. The nature music alone--music of river and rainbow, fire and forest--is enough to bribe people with any love of the country in them to endure the passages of political philosophy in the <b>sure</b> <b>hope</b> of a prettier page to come. Everybody, too, can enjoy the love music, the hammer and anvil music, the clumping of the giants, the tune of the young woodsman's horn, the trilling of the bird, the dragon music and nightmare music and thunder and lightning music, the profusion of simple melody, the sensuous charm of the orchestration: in short, the vast extent of common ground between The Ring and the ordinary music we use for play and pleasure. Hence it is that the four separate music-plays of which it is built have become popular throughout Europe as operas. We shall presently see that one of them, Night Falls On The Gods, actually is an opera.|$|E
