40|$|The {{subject of}} this study was the {{measurement}} of certain anatomic diameters in the <b>sacral</b> spinal <b>canal</b> by using the lumbosacral MRI studies of 25 patients with unclear pain symptoms, in order to estimate, from the pure anatomic point of view, the capability to perform thecaloscopy in this anatomical region. Since now anatomic morphometric data of the sacral region were delivered only from the cadaver specimens’ sectioning performed in anatomic institutes during the 60 ’s and 70 ’s years. The parameters measured were: 1) the inclination of the lumbosacral angle, 2) the duralsack’s end, 3) the length of all the sacral spinal processes, 4) The length of the <b>sacral</b> spinal <b>canal</b> in its centre, and 5) The width of the sacral hiatus. The results of the measurements were in detail presented and an evaluation of them concerning the applicability of flexible endoscopes in the <b>sacral</b> spinal <b>canal</b> was performed. It was proven that the duralsack’s end in 40 % of the patients at the middle of the S 2 vertebral body lies, an anatomical position, which through the sacral hiatus easy to access is. The length under the sacral spinal processes is smaller than the length of the <b>sacral</b> spinal <b>canal</b> in its centre, a fact that makes the manipulation of a flexible endoscope easier, if someone works straight under the spinal processes and has a smaller distance to run.

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONHydatid cyst of bone {{constitutes}} only 0. 5 - 2 % of all hydatidoses. The thoracic spine is {{the most}} common site of spinal hydatidoses. Primary hydatid cyst of the <b>sacral</b> spinal <b>canal</b> is rare. PRESENTATION OF CASEA 19 -year-old man had cauda equina syndrome with pelvic pain 15 days ago, the pelvic radiography shows a lytic image depend on the left sacral wing. MRI showed an intra-pelvic cystic image invading the sacrum T 1 hypointense and T 2 W hyperintense. The Hydatid serology was positive. Surgical treatment consisted of a wide drainage of hydatid cavity dug in the left sacral wing, and by which it communicated intra pelvic, with removal of the entire cyst by gentle aspiration, abundant rinsing with hypertonic saline, release and sacred roots encompassed in a puddle of fibrosis hydatid. The evolution was good with recovery of perineal sensation and anal tone. The sacroiliac joint was considered stable and did not require synthesis or reconstruction. DISCUSSIONHydatid cysts predominantly occur in liver and lungs. Involvement of other organs is uncommon. Neither surgery nor medical therapy is generally effective for bone, especially spinal hydatidosis. The initial treatment of choice is surgical excision for neural decompression and establishing diagnosis. Albendazole is the drug of choice against this disease, when suspected, presurgical use of Albendazole in Echinococcus infestations reduces risk of recurrence and/or facilitates surgery by reducing intracystic pressure. CONCLUSIONA missed diagnosis of hydatid cyst could be devastating. Hence, hydatid cyst should be kept as a differential diagnosis, when encountered with a cystic lesion of sacrum. In addition, longterm follow-up is mandatory as recurrence is high despite use scolicidal agents...|$|R
50|$|The dorsal {{surface of}} the sacrum is convex and {{narrower}} than the pelvic surface. In the middle line is the median sacral crest, surmounted by three or four tubercles—the rudimentary spinous processes of the upper three or four sacral vertebrae.

The floor of the groove is formed by the united laminae of the corresponding vertebrae. The laminae of the fifth sacral vertebra, and sometimes those of the fourth, do not meet at the back, resulting in a fissure known as the sacral hiatus in the posterior wall of the <b>sacral</b> <b>canal.</b> The <b>sacral</b> <b>canal</b> is a continuation of the spinal canal and runs throughout the greater part of the sacrum.

40|$|The shallow lateral rece&ses of the trefoil {{shape of}} the lumbar spinal canal have been implicated in the {{production}} of the spinal stenosis syndrome. In the present study, 485 skeletons of South African Blacks and Whites were examined in order to establish the incidence and possible genesis of the trefoil configuration.

Of 74 trefoil-shaped vertebrae, 68 (92 per cent) were found at the fifth lumbar level. It is suggested that the trefoil configuration is a common non-pathological condition, usually of the fifth lumbar vertebral canal, and is probably a developmental variation of normal anatomy. The {{shape of the}} human upper lumbar vertebral canal is almost circular and this changes gradually to a triangular shape in the lower lumbar vertebrae (New-man 1 976; Eisenstein 1 977). The lumbar vertebrae thus provide an appropriate transition between the obviously circular shape of the thoracic vertebral canal and the markedly triangular shape of the <b>sacral</b> spinal <b>canal.</b> The lower lumbar vertebrae frequently demons-Plan view of LS vertebra showing a trefoil configuration of the spinal canal caused by an alteration {{in the shape of the}} laminac rather than by the arthritic superior facets. trate a modification in the shape of the canal in that the sides of the triangle are indented into the space of the triangle, tending to compartmentalise the lateral corners into lateral recesses, the whole canal taking the shape of a three-leaf clover or trefoil (Armstrong 1952). The interlaminar angle is the “third leaf ” (Fig. 1). The clinical relevance of the trefoil configuration lies in a possible predisposition to compression of lumbar and sacral nerve roots. Epstein, Epstein and Lavine (1962) considered shallowness of the lateral recesses to be the “ primary abnormality of clinical significance ” in spinal stenosis. There are two controversial questions related to this trefoil configuration: its cause and its possible ill-effects.

40|$|OBJECT In {{sacroiliac}} {{screw fixation}} of unstable pelvic injuries in geriatric patients, poor bone quality often obscures important bony landmarks in fluoroscopic images. The authors analyzed {{the feasibility of}} injecting a transhiatal contrast agent (CA) into the <b>sacral</b> <b>canal</b> to improve fluoroscopic visualization in the sacral epidural space. METHODS Eight fresh cadaveric whole-body specimens from human donors whose mean age {{at the time of}} death was 78 years (range 69 - 87 years) were used. First, to identify bony landmarks without CA enhancement, the authors acquired fluoroscopy images of the native <b>sacral</b> <b>canal,</b> using lateral, inlet, and outlet projections. Through puncture of the sacral hiatus, 8 - 10 ml of CA was injected into the epidural space. Fluoroscopy images were then acquired in the standard pelvic views to identify the bony landmarks. To assess the effect of the CA enhancement, visibility of the landmarks was assessed before and after CA injection. Each identified landmark was scored as 1, and summative landmark scores of up to 10 were determined for each specimen. RESULTS The cadaveric specimens were representative of bone structures in the geriatric population. In all specimens, epidural CA injection enhanced the fluoroscopic visualization of the <b>sacral</b> <b>canal</b> and of the S- 1 foramina. The enhancement increased the total bony landmark score from 5. 9 (range 4 - 8) without CA injection to 8. 1 (range 6 - 10) after CA injection. Considering only intrasacral landmarks, the seore was increased from 1. 5 to 3. CONCLUSIONS Injection of a transhiatal epidural CA improves fluoroscopic imaging of the <b>sacral</b> <b>canal</b> and of the neural foramina. Hence, this technique could be applied to help the surgeon identify anatomical landmarks during sacroiliac screw fixation in geriatric patients...|$|E
