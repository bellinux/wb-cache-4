40|$|The {{scavenging}} process of two-stroke engines is unfavourably characterised {{by the loss}} of large part of the fresh charge from the exhaust port. Besides, bad combustion and misfire occur at light loads, because of the excessive ratio of residual gas to fresh gas within the cylinder. To avoid fuel short-circuiting to the exhaust port, the solution is direct fuel injection, as well as charge stratification or ATAC are the solutions for light-load operation. With direct fuel injection and charge stratification or ATAC, the simple two-stroke engine with loop-and-crankcase scavenging for motorbikes, thanks to its intrinsic internal EGR, might satisfy the ECE 2002 exhaust emission limits even without catalytic converter. Evolved two-stroke engines should be considered for application on automobiles, since direct injection and charge stratification equalise four-stroke and two-stroke-engines as regards exhaust emissions. Besides, two-stroke engines deliver higher torque, especially at low engine speeds and, of course, have double firing frequency that allows reducing the number of cylinders. In this case, two-stroke engines with poppet valves and external <b>scavenging</b> <b>blower</b> are preferable, to facilitate lubrication and to reduce oil consumption, engine wear and cylinder thermal deformation...|$|E
5000|$|Large {{two stroke}} engines {{do not use}} {{crankcase}} compression, but instead a separate <b>scavenge</b> <b>blower</b> or supercharger. Their crankcases are reserved for lubrication purposes and are {{comparable to that of}} a four-stroke engine.|$|R
50|$|Trojan {{also made}} another split-single engine {{later with the}} {{cylinders}} arranged in a 'V' formation. The unusual 'V6' design had two split-single sets of cylinders (4 cylinders total) on one bank of the V and two <b>scavenge</b> <b>blower</b> cylinders on the other bank of the V.|$|R
50|$|Small petrol {{two-stroke}} engines, such as for motorcycles, use crankcase compression {{rather than}} a separate supercharger or <b>scavenge</b> <b>blower.</b> This uses {{both sides of the}} piston as working faces, the lower side of the piston acting as a piston compressor to compress the inlet charge ready for the next stroke. The piston is still considered as single-acting, as only one of these faces produces power.|$|R
50|$|Being a {{two-stroke}} engine, {{there was}} also a <b>scavenge</b> <b>blower,</b> operating at 21-25 psi. This was of unorthodox design: a rectangular pumping chamber formed on the triangular coupling frame. A vertical partition inside this was free to move vertically, but held in place from side-to-side. As the chamber moved with the frame's circular motion, this partition effectively moved from side to side within the chamber, providing a pump action for the scavenge air.|$|R
2500|$|A Co-Co [...] "Super Deltic" [...] was {{proposed}} but not built. There were three potential designs between 4000hp and 4600hp weighing [...] between 114 and 119 tons {{with a maximum}} axle load of [...] The locomotives would have looked {{very similar to the}} eventual Class 50s, though slightly longer. All three designs would have had two 18-cylinder turbocharged engines, based on the 9-cylinder turbocharged engine used in the British Rail Class 23 [...] "Baby Deltic" [...] and the locomotive would have been designated Class 51. [...] The Class 55's engines were not turbocharged, although they did have centrifugal <b>scavenging</b> <b>blowers.</b>|$|R
50|$|Four-stroking is {{less likely}} with {{compression}} ignition engines (i.e. diesel engines) than it is with spark-ignition engines (i.e. petrol engines). Diesel engines are also rare as the small two-strokes where inertial scavenging is used. When large two-stroke diesel engines are used, these have scavenging by forced induction and so are generally immune to four-stroking when idling at low speed or low power. These <b>scavenge</b> <b>blowers</b> may be mechanically-driven Roots blowers or turbochargers. As a turbocharger has some lag time coming up to speed, turbo-charged two-stroke diesels often display four-stroking when starting, or when suddenly accelerating from idle. Some large engines, such as those from EMD, minimize this by using a turbocharger with an auxiliary mechanical drive to give better scavenging at low rpm.|$|R
50|$|The engines {{were large}} {{horizontal}} heavy oil engines, typically used as generating plants or to power industrial plant such as air compressors, water pumps or mills. They were produced {{in a range}} of sizes, based on a standard cylinder unit, as either in-line or horizontally-opposed cylinder engines. They had clerestory combustion chambers with single inlet and exhaust valves above and below the chamber. Other manufacturers at the time, notably Brush, produced very similar engines as modular, opposed cylinder units. Crossley's were distinctive for using a monobloc head on each cylinder, although this was {{in the form of a}} self-supporting wet liner and the water jacket around the whole cylinder bank was a separate casting. The engines were also unusual for being one of the few practical applications of an electrically-driven supercharger. This gave a relatively low boost pressure and was more of a <b>scavenge</b> <b>blower,</b> but it could increase output power by up to 50%.|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} Single Cylinder Test Engine Program {{is conducted}} {{to confirm the}} analytically projected performance of a two-stroke cycle diesel engine for aircraft applications. The test engine delivered 78 kW indicated power from 1007 cc displacement, operating at 3500 RPM on Schnuerle loop scavenged two-stroke cycle. Testing confirms {{the ability of a}} proposed 4 -cylinder version of such an engine to reach the target power at altitude, in a highly turbocharged configuration. The experimental program defines all necessary parameters to permit design of a multicylinder engine for eventual flight applications; including injection system requirement, turbocharging, heat rejection, breathing, scavenging, and structural requirements. The multicylinder engine concept is configured to operate with an augmented turbocharger, but with no primary <b>scavenge</b> <b>blower.</b> The test program is oriented to provide a balanced turbocharger compressor to turbine power balance without an auxiliary scavenging system. Engine cylinder heat rejection to the ambient air has been significantly reduced and the minimum overall turbocharger efficiency required is within the range of commercially available turbochargers. Analytical studies and finite element modeling is made of insulated configurations of the engines - including both ceramic and metallic versions. A second generation test engine is designed based on current test results...|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} engines {{were built}} in Belfast by Harland & Wolff under licence from Burmeister & Wain known as the [...] "Harlandic" [...] type. An eight cylinder in line uniflow two-stroke engines with <b>blower</b> <b>scavenging</b> which developed [...] at 1200 rpm. The transmission was a Voith-Sinclair torque converter design with two final drive gear ratios, geared for [...] 0r [...] Two [...] "National" [...] diesel generator sets producing DC power for train lighting and air conditioning.|$|R
50|$|The 6-110 series engines utilize uniflow <b>scavenging,</b> where a <b>blower</b> {{mounted to}} the {{exterior}} of the engine provides intake air through cored passages in the engine block and ports in the cylinder walls at slightly greater than atmospheric pressure. The engine exhausts through push-rod operated poppet valves in the cylinder head, with either two or four valves per cylinder. Unit fuel injection is employed, one injector per cylinder, with no high fuel pressure outside of the injector body. The injectors are cycled from the same camshaft responsible for opening the exhaust valves.|$|R
50|$|Larger engines usually use a {{separate}} <b>blower</b> for <b>scavenging</b> {{and it was}} {{for this type of}} operation that the Roots blower has been utilized. Historically, many designs of blower have been used, from separate pumping cylinders, 'top hat' pistons combining two pistons of different diameter the larger one being used for <b>scavenging,</b> various rotary <b>blowers</b> and centrifugal turbo-compressors, including turbochargers. Turbocharging two-stroke engines is difficult, but not impossible, as a turbocharger does not provide any boost until it has had time to spin up to speed. Purely turbocharged two stroke engines may thus have difficulty when starting, with poor combustion and dirty exhausts, possibly even four-stroking. Some two-stroke turbochargers, notably those used on Electro-Motive Diesel locomotive engines, are mechanically driven at lower engine speeds through an overrunning clutch to provide adequate scavenging air. As engine speed and exhaust gas volume increase, the turbocharger no longer is dependent on mechanical drive and the overrunning clutch disengages.|$|R
50|$|The new 110 engine {{embodies the}} same {{advanced}} principles of high-speed, two-cycle design as the 71 series, of {{which more than}} 45,000,000 horsepower have been produced by Detroit Diesel since 1937. The horsepower rating of 275 at 1800 r.p.m. is attained with a b.m.e.p. of 92 pounds per square inch. Bore is 5 inches and stroke, 5.6 inches. Features include <b>blower</b> <b>scavenging</b> with a new and highly efficient gear-driven centrifugal blower furnishing considerably more air for the cylinders than is needed for combustion. GM unit injectors (one for each cylinder) pump, meter and atomize the fuel, and are easily removed for inspection or exchange. Cylinder block and head are one-piece castings, both being symmetrical about a vertical plane between the No. 3 and 4 cylinders. This symmetry allows the cylinder head and block to be reversed, giving a choice of rotational directions and making possible a variety of accessory locations to suit installation requirements.|$|R
