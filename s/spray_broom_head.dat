5000|$|Originally {{described}} in 1795 by Schrader as Sophora juncea, {{it was given}} its current binomial name by Hoffmannsegg in 1824.

Alternate names include golden <b>spray,</b> native <b>broom</b> and swishbush.|$|R
5000|$|The witches of Alt Berguedà and Cadí {{were said}} to apply unguents, climb up the chimney and, mounted on <b>brooms,</b> <b>head</b> for Pedraforca to hold a great {{gathering}}. The main feature of the gathering {{was said to be}} a great circle dance. Similarly, the witches of the Alt Pallars and of the Vall d'Aran {{were said to}} meet on the plain of Beret. In Camp de Tarragona, the witches were said to assemble on the peak of Montserrat, where they dance naked in the cold to the sound of a violin played by the Devil.|$|R

5000|$|Shortly {{after he}} sold Marysville Rotary Broom Service, Inc., Drumm would {{start a new}} company, Drumm Industries, where he would {{manufacture}} push brooms {{for a short period}} until a no-compete contract would expire. In 1988 he would receive a patent for a push <b>broom</b> <b>head</b> of the channel-mounted bristle type. He would then focus a considerable amount of time innovating a replaceable strip brush. This changed the whole process of manufacturing tube-brooms, as one tube could be recycled simply by replacing the brush through replaceable slide-on strips, versus the old method of wrapping the brush around the tube, welding it together, and shipping the tube back for a replacement wrap when it was worn out, or scrapping the tube altogether. Drumm would obtain several patents relating to the strip brush innovation.|$|R
50|$|There {{is a large}} {{variety of}} nesting birds across the reserve such as reed warblers, reed bunting, and sedge warbler. The {{woodland}} areas are habitat of such birds as greater spotted woodpecker, nuthatch, treecreeper, barn owl and tawny owl. The stream {{that runs through the}} common is called Fox’s Beck. The stream is shallow, free-flowing and supports several species of snail, caddis fly and dragonfly, with water voles living along the banks. Fox’s Beck and the common until quite recently had common rights attached to certain properties in the Southrepps and other rights of common included turbary (peat cutting), estovers (firewood and bedding for livestock) and piscary (fishing). Livestock could be grazed and many other natural resources were exploited, such as reed cutting for thatch; alder and hazel were coppiced for tool handles, twigs were collected for the use of <b>broom</b> <b>heads</b> and willow was cut for use in screens.|$|R
6000|$|There was {{not much}} more {{fighting}} after this. Stephen kept all {{the eastern part of}} the kingdom, and Henry was brought up at Gloucester till his father sent for him, to take leave of him before going on a crusade. Geoffrey died during this crusade. He was fond of hunting, and was generally seen with a <b>spray</b> of <b>broom</b> blossom in his cap. The French name for this plant is genet; and thus his nickname was [...] "Plantagenet;" [...] and this became a kind of surname to the kings of England.|$|R
60|$|Maude {{was proud}} and disdainful, and treated her young {{husband in the}} most contemptuous way; and Geoffrey avoided her in return, {{spending}} {{most of his time}} in hunting in the woods, where he used to wear the <b>spray</b> of <b>broom</b> that became the cognizance of his house, and caused their surname of Plantagenet. Perhaps it was in contrast to his wife's haughtiness that he chose to adopt this plant, considered as the emblem of humility, and reminding her that she had married the descendant of the woodman Torquatus.|$|R
5000|$|Curling brushes {{may have}} fabric, hog hair, or {{horsehair}} heads. Modern curling brush handles are usually hollow tubes made of fibreglass or carbon fibre {{instead of a}} solid length of wooden dowel. These hollow tube handles are lighter and stronger than wooden handles, allowing faster sweeping and also enabling more downward force {{to be applied to}} the <b>broom</b> <b>head</b> with reduced shaft flex. New, [...] "directional fabric" [...] brooms, which players are worried will alter the fundamentals of the sport by reducing the level of skill required, have been accused of giving players an unfair advantage. The new brooms were temporarily banned by the World Curling Federation and Curling Canada for the 2015-2016 season. The new brooms [...] "isolate the friction caused by brushing only where the running surface of the rock has contact with ice--on top of the pebble--with little resistance", which makes sweepers have unprecedented control over the direction the stone goes.|$|R

25|$|On 27–28 June and 1 July 1960, No. 92220, then {{allocated}} to Cardiff Canton shed, hauled the BR Western Region's flagship Paddington to Cardiff, Swansea, Neyland and Fishguard Harbour passenger express trains, the up Red Dragon and the down Capitals United Express between Cardiff and Paddington, reportedly having to delay its arrival at Paddington {{to allow for}} completion of restaurant services because it was running so early; easily outperforming the regular Britannia passenger express locomotives, which it was observed overtaking (while hauling a full rake of 10+ passenger express coaches) on several occasions. However, its career on these flagship services was cut short, by order of BR senior management, allegedly from fear of damage to its running gear which wasn't designed for extended high speed express work. BR management's embargo, issued after they received word of the runs on 27–28 June, wasn't enforced until after driver Eddie <b>Broom,</b> <b>head</b> of Canton Shed's Local Departmental Committee (the local branch shop steward of ASLEF, the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen's extremely powerful trades union), had his turn on 92220's down Capitals United Express run, on 1 July 1960.|$|R

5000|$|A Turk's head brush {{is a type}} of {{cleaning}} brush where the bristles are arranged covering the end of the stem as a half-sphere, so {{that the end of the}} stem does not come into direct contact with the surface being cleaned, especially when cleaning the inside of a cylindrical object. A larger type, mounted on a long stem and used for removing cobwebs, is called a Turk's <b>head</b> <b>broom.</b> The name has long been in use for this type of brush, so named because its cleaning end resembles a [...] "wild" [...] head of hair. Turk's <b>head</b> brushes and <b>brooms</b> are used for domestic purposes, for cleaning artillery, for pharmaceutical use, for sweeping chimneys, and for other purposes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, {{talking about}} being let in puts me {{in mind of}} a story," [...] came from Shadow. [...] "A man stayed out later nights than his wife liked. One night he didn't come home until very late, and {{he stood on the}} sidewalk, afraid to let himself in. Along came a friend and asked him what he was doing. 'Please ring the bell and see if my wife is home,' said the man. So the friend rang the bell, and the next instant the door opened, and he got a <b>broom</b> over his <b>head.</b> 'Is she in?' asked the man on the sidewalk. 'Sure she is,' {{answered}} his friend. 'Go right in and you'll get a warm welcome!'" [...] And at this story there was a general snicker.|$|R
5000|$|Tom then flies by {{his house}} spying Jerry, {{who thinks that}} he saw something, Jerry then {{opens the front door}} and gets knocked down by Tom, who then gets off the broom and points to Jerry. The broom hits Jerry and sweeps him into a dustpan. Tom leaves and returns to the witch's house where the witch is waiting for him. She is very angry about Tom [...] "stealing a ride" [...] so the witch casts a spell on the broom saying that she'll give Tom a REAL ride. The broom takes off on a painful ride with Tom on it. The <b>broom</b> drags Tom's <b>head</b> through the ceiling, causes him to bounce down the stairs, and into a table. The broom then acts like a pogo stick with Tom holding on to it.|$|R
60|$|When {{you have}} seen a burning {{mountain}} you begin to appreciate Japanese architecture. It is not solid. Every one is burned out once or twice casually. A business isn't respectable until it has received its baptism of fire. But fire is of no importance. The one thing that inconveniences a Jap is an earthquake. Consequently, he arranges his house that it shall fall lightly as a bundle of <b>broom</b> upon his <b>head.</b> Still further safeguarding himself, he has no foundations, but the corner-posts rest on the crowns of round stones sunk in the earth. The corner-posts take {{the wave of the}} shock, and, though the building may give way like an eel-trap, nothing very serious happens. This is what epicures of earthquakes aver. I wait for mine own experiences, but not near a suspected district such as the Burning Mountain.|$|R
