500|$|Sagan {{incorporated}} Kip Thorne's {{study of}} wormhole space travel into the screenplay. The characterization of Dr. Ellie Arroway {{was inspired by}} Dr. Jill Tarter, head of Project Phoenix of the SETI Institute; Jodie Foster researched the lead role by meeting her. Tarter [...] served as a consultant on the story, realistically portraying struggling careers of women scientists from the 1950s to 1970s. The writers debated whether Arroway should have a baby at the film's end. Although Guber was impressed with Sagan and Druyan's treatment, he hired various screenwriters to rewrite the script. New characters were added, one of them [...] a Native American park ranger-turned-astronaut. Guber suggested that Arroway have an estranged teenage son, who he believed would add more depth to the storyline. [...] "Here was a woman consumed {{with the idea that}} there was <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> worth listening to," [...] Guber said, [...] "but the one thing she could never make contact with was her own child. To me, that's what the film had to be about." [...] Sagan and Druyan disagreed with Guber's idea and it was not incorporated into the storyline. In 1982, Guber took Contact to Warner Bros. Pictures and with the film's development stalled, Sagan started to turn his original idea into a novel, which was published by Simon and Schuster in September 1985. The film adaptation remained in development and Guber eventually vacated his position at Warner Bros. in 1989.|$|E
2500|$|A {{newspaper}} editorial {{from the}} Richmond News Leader opined that [...] "Attempts {{to dismiss the}} reported sightings under the rationale as exhibited by Project Bluebook (sic) won't solve the mystery … and serve only to heighten the suspicion that there's <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> {{that the air force}} doesn't want us to know about", while a Wichita-based UPI reporter noted [...] that [...] "Ordinary radar does not pick up planets and stars." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2006, Feinstein {{confirmed}} {{she would}} vote against Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito, though disagreed with filibustering the choice: [...] "When {{it comes to}} filibustering a Supreme Court appointment, {{you really have to}} have <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> whether it's gross moral turpitude or something that comes to the surface. This is a man I might disagree with, (but) that doesn't mean he shouldn't be on the court." ...|$|E

Now, obviously {{the three of us}} weren't going to blurt out, 'Hey, Houston, we've got something moving alongside of us and we don't know what it is', you know?... We knew that those transmissions would be heard by all sorts of people and somebody might have demanded we turn back because of aliens or whatever the reason is."

I've {{a feeling that}} if I'd look into them I'd see the sun setting, the clouds coloring, the twilight shadows changing; and then back of that the secret of it all--of you--Oh! I can't explain, but it seems so." ...|$|E
6000|$|Joe's rolling voice awoke {{him next}} morning and he rose with a {{singular}} zest. When or where in his life had he awakened in such a beautiful place? Almost he understood why Venters and Bess had been haunted by memories of Surprise Valley. The morning was clear, cool, sweet; the peaks were dim and soft in rosy cloud; shafts of golden sunlight shot down into the purple shadows. Mocking-birds were singing. His body was sore and tired from the unaccustomed travel, but his heart was full, happy. His spirit wanted to run, and {{he knew there was}} <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>there</b> waiting to meet it. The Indian and the trader and the Mormon all meant more to him this morning. He had grown a little overnight. Nas Ta Bega's deep [...] "Bi Nai" [...] rang in his ears, and the smiles of Withers and Joe were greetings. He had friends; he had work; and there was rich, strange, and helpful life to live. There was even a difference in the mustang Nack-yal. He came readily; he did not look wild; he had a friendly eye; and Shefford liked him more.|$|E

You need not search for me, for I assure you that this letter is posted by a friend, and that you will have your trouble in vain if you try to find me. I am sorry to leave you in such a tight place, but one or other of us must be squeezed, and on the whole I prefer that it should be you. You'll find nothing in the bank, and about L13,000 unaccounted for. I'm not sure that the best thing you can do is not to realize what you can, and imitate your senior's example. If you act at once you may get clean away. If not, it's not only that you must put up your shutters, but I am afraid that this missing money could hardly be included as an ordinary debt, and of course you are legally responsible for it just as much as I am. Take a friend's advice and get to America. A young man with brains can always do <b>something</b> <b>out</b> <b>there,</b> and you can live down this little mischance. It will be a cheap lesson if it teaches you to take nothing upon trust in business, and to insist upon knowing exactly what your partner is doing, however senior he may be to you.|$|E

50|$|Nova {{is about}} escapism, {{which is quite}} a common theme for The Sound of Arrows - kind of what the whole album is about: wanting {{something}} better when you're stuck in a rut and just driving toward an ideal. Sometimes, it can be great because it can get you places, but it's sometimes like you're diluting yourself into thinking that there is always <b>something</b> better <b>out</b> <b>there.</b> It goes both ways.

50|$|Jayme Richardson (née Paris), born 27 April 1989, is an Australian Paralympic cyclist. She {{was born}} in the Sydney suburb of Blacktown with {{cerebellar}} ataxia due to asphyxiation at birth.

[...] So, it's definitely a trick to not dwell on the good or the bad. In terms of reading reviews online and things like that, I feel like I've nailed down a super healthy approach at that stuff. So, I will definitely check it out a little bit, but the moment it feels like I'm dwelling on it too much or thinking about it too much, I step back and remember at the end of the day, I've just got to do the best job that I know how to do and just be sincere and be honest, try to do the right thing. At the end of the day, people will talk and that's totally cool and I'll just keep fighting the good fight." ...|$|R
