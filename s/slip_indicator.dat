50|$|In aviation, {{the turn}} and <b>slip</b> <b>indicator</b> (T/S, a.k.a. turn and bank indicator) and the turn {{coordinator}} (TC) variant are essentially two aircraft flight instruments in one device. One indicates {{the rate of}} turn, or {{the rate of change}} in the aircraft's heading, the other part indicates whether the aircraft is in coordinated flight, showing the slip or skid of the turn. The <b>slip</b> <b>indicator</b> is actually an inclinometer that at rest displays the angle of the aircraft's lateral axis with respect to horizontal, and in motion displays this angle as modified by the acceleration of the aircraft.|$|E

40|$|Active tectonic {{processes}} in south-central Italy have been analyzed {{by means of}} spatial and kinematic analysis of fault zones In (i) the axial zones of the Apenninic mountain chain, {{where most of the}} seismic strain is released within intramontane basin areas (i. e., Norcia, Fucino, Vallo di Diane, high Agri Valley, etc.); and (ii) in the Gargano promontory, where earthquakes with magnitudes up to 6 and 7 have Occurred. Our work focuses on {{a better understanding of the}} most recent deformation processes acting in these areas, and the relative motion between the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian crustal units. In order to derive the information above, we integrated structural and seismological data from the Apennines and the Gargano area. The results of our analysis show that the style of active deformation in both of these areas is broadly consistent with the current stress field. Kinematic data from <b>slip</b> <b>indicators</b> on active fault planes are, in fact, consistent with the geometric proprieties and spatial arrangement of the various fault segments and indicate that most of the active structures are characterized by oblique motion. The overall direction of extension appears to be at fairly high angle to the trend of the Apennines, with a component of horizontal left-lateral motion between Tyrrhenia and Adria...|$|R
40|$|Conference ABSTRACT: Aviemore Dam was {{constructed}} across the Waitaki River valley in the mid- 1960 s. The dam straddles the steeply WSW-dipping Waitangi Fault. At {{the time of}} construction, no evidence of late Quaternary movement was documented on the fault. However, in the mid 1990 s, dam safety review investigations unearthed evidence of late Quaternary deformation, and {{this led to the}} detailed paleoseismological investigations that are summarized here. The investigations documented two, and possibly three, surface rupture fault movements on the Waitangi Fault in the last c. 23, 000 years, with the most recent movement between 13, 100 and 14, 100 years ago. These ruptures were located up to 10 m west of the bedrock fault that juxtaposes Mesozoic- and Tertiary-age rocks (respectively east and west of the fault), and had single-event vertical separations in the range of 0. 5 m to 2. 0 m. Slickenside-lineations, and other <b>slip</b> <b>indicators,</b> show oblique right-lateral – reverse movement along the fault in the late Quaternary with horizontal (H) to vertical (V) ratios of displacement in the range of 1 H: 3 V to 1 H: 1 V, suggesting net single-event surface-rupture displacements in the range of 0. 53 m to 2. 9 m. In addition, a zone of “small-scale ” late Quaternary faults and folds extends up to at least 150 m west of the Waitangi Fault. The fault displacement characterisations documented here were subsequently used to derive earthquake performance assessments for the dam, and to evaluate dam safety under direct fault rupture loadings. ...|$|R

40|$|Core {{recovered}} during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 319 {{from below}} the Kumano forearc basin of Japan's Nankai margin {{provides some of}} the only in situ samples from an inner accretionary wedge, and sheds light on the tectonic history of a seismically hazardous region. The 84 m of core comprises Miocene-age well-bedded muds, silts, and volcaniclastic sediments. Beds increase in dip with depth, and are cut by (i) soft-sediment deformation bands (“vein structures”), (ii) ? 1 -cm thick shear zones within ? 10 -cm thick regions of high shear strain, and (iii) < 1 -mm thick slickensided faults which are the youngest structures in the core and highly localized. Microstructural analyses of the shear zones suggest that they formed via multiple increments of shear localization and a mixed granular and cataclastic flow. Kinematic analysis of <b>slip</b> <b>indicators</b> in shear zones further reveals that they formed via north–south shortening. In contrast, the faults cut the shear zones with mixed slip kinematics, and accommodated northwest–southeast shortening, roughly parallel to the modern shortening direction. The entire section was also rotated ? 15 ° counterclockwise about a roughly vertical axis. Therefore the principle strain axes and stratigraphic section rotated during or postdating development of the major sub-basin (? 5. 6 – 3. 8 Ma) unconformity, a time that generally coincides with a change in the Philippine Sea plate convergence direction. Forearc basin development therefore postdates a protracted geologic evolution of shear-zone development, tectonic rotations, and inner-wedge development, the last of which coincides with a rheological evolution toward localized frictional faulting...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Recent {{discoveries in}} {{subduction}} zones worldwide [...] including here in Cascadia [...] have illuminated the once shrouded process of plate convergence below the seismogenic zone. Early geodetic [Dragert, et al., 2001] and seismic [Obara, 2002] signals were observed to correlate {{in space and}} time, and were associated with periodic episodes of deep slow slip, termed Episodic Tremor and Slip (ETS) [Rogers and Dragert, 2003]. In this dissertation, I present evidence further detailing the process of where, how, and how often deep slow slip occurs using several catalogs of low-frequency earthquakes (LFEs) as slow <b>slip</b> <b>indicators.</b> In the first section I compare four distinct LFE families that span {{the range of the}} ETS zone beneath western Washington State. I find that LFE behavior varies systematically with depth: LFE moments, swarm durations, and swarm recurrence intervals are all largest in the updip portion of the ETS zone, and smallest in the downdip portion. I interpret these systematic differences as a result of variation in fault strength on the subduction interface [...] with the strongest coupling found updip (near the seismogenic zone), and the weakest coupling found downdip. In the second section I look within individual LFE families and perform double-difference event relocations to map out the spatial extent of the LFE patch (or patches) responsible for LFE generation. I determine LFE locking efficiency from estimates of LFE density and released seismic moment. I also track LFE migrations over time in an effort to map the progression of slow slip fronts, rapid tremor reversals (RTRs), and other phenomena...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Two {{earthquakes}} ruptured {{the western}} strand of the Saddle Mountain fault after the Cordilleran ice sheet began its {{retreat from the}} Puget Sound Lowland about 17 ka. The fault system includes multiple northeast-trending thrust faults on the southeastern Olympic Peninsula delineated on {{light detection and ranging}} topography by prominent, east-side-up scarps that deform Vashon till and extend over 6 – 7 km. The Cargill Creek Trench on the Saddle Mountain West fault exposed faulted drift and postglacial colluvium below a 1 – 2 m high scarp. Steeply dipping northeast-striking faults form a 10 m wide zone beneath the scarp. Structural relations in the trench indicate that two earthquakes produced at least 1 m of vertical separation. Additional folding or faulting beyond the trench raised the scarp to a total height of 1. 7 m. Aligned cobbles dipping approximately 40 ° to the north attest to earthquake-related tilting. A cobble firmly lodged in till and split by a secondary fault indicates that hanging-wall deformation involved a dextral component of slip. However, slip on the master fault may have involved a left-lateral component based on <b>slip</b> <b>indicators</b> at adjacent trench sites in the region. A single charcoal age and estimates of the onset of ice retreat limit the time of the oldest earthquake to 17 – 7. 7 ka. The most recent event occurred after 1. 7 ka, and may be the same earthquake that dammed Price Lake about 1100 yr ago known from related studies. Empirical relations suggest that the most recent earthquake was about M 7 0 : 2 and produced an estimated total slip of 1. 3 – 1. 7 m. The total postglacial slip rate ranges from 0. 1 to 0 : 3 m=k yr. These results support the hypothesis that the Saddle Mountain fault {{is part of a larger}} fault system that accommodates transpressive strain as the Puget Lowland crust migrates around the eastern flank of the Olympic Mountains...|$|R

40|$|A {{major problem}} in {{seismology}} and structural geology is the lack, at least apparently, of clear records of seismic fault slip. Some geologists even suggested that, except for pseudotachylytes, earthquakes do not leave detectable geological indicators along faults. Discovering new geological indicators of seismic fault slip is therefore a challenging but also a very important target to advance the knowledge of how, where, when, and why earthquakes occur along faults. High-velocity weakening of faults may drive fault motion during large earthquakes. Laboratory experiments on simulated faults in Carrara marble performed at seismic slip rates (about 1 m/s) showed that thermal decomposition of calcite due to frictional heating induces pronounced fault weakening with very low friction coefficients (about 0. 1 instead of a typical rock friction coefficient of 0. 7). The ultra-low friction appears {{to be associated with}} the flash heating on the ultrafine products of calcite decomposition. It follows that thermal decomposition may be an important process for the dynamic weakening of carbonate-bearing faults and the products of calcite thermal decomposition (i. e. ultrafine particles and decomposition-related minerals) may be clear <b>indicators</b> of seismic <b>slip</b> in exhumed faults. Energy budget calculations predict seismic slip to be localized in ultra-thin slipping zones, compared to crystalline rocks. This research field is among the most promising ones in seismology and structural geology and recent results from laboratory simulations require proper validation in natural examples. Other likely seismic <b>slip</b> <b>indicators</b> are fault zone-related pulverized rocks, consisting of mechanically-pulverized rocks lacking in significant shear and preserving most of their original fabric. Pulverized rocks such as those recently found in the damage zone of active faults (i. e., the Hartebeestfontein mine in South Africa and the San Andreas Fault in California) are still poorly documented and studied. Further field and experimental studies are therefore required to establish the diffusion of these fault zone rocks, the mechanism of production, and whether they can be commonly considered as indicators of ancient earthquakes. Carbonate rocks usually occur in the upper portion of the crust and are often known as hypocenters of shallow earthquakes. For this reason, exposures of exhumed faults in carbonate rocks are a promising target to study earthquake rupture dynamics in the shallow crust. Faults exposed in carbonate rocks from three sites of central Italy (i. e. Mattinata, Sperlonga, and Venere sites) and one site in northwestern England (i. e. the Dent Fault) are here indicated as potentially suitable to research earthquake indicators similar to those mentioned above (i. e. mineralogical thermal decomposition and pulverized rocks) ...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that the 5 – 10 -km-wide zone of wrench faulting {{preserved in the}} Arakapas valley and Limassol Forest areas of Cyprus, along the southern margin of the Troodos ophiolite, {{is part of a}} fossil oceanic transform fault system. However, despite detailed study of this, the “Southern Troodos transform fault zone,” and neighboring part of the main Troodos massif, no consensus has been reached as to its sense of motion. Some have postulated sinistral slip, some dextral, whereas others have suggested that it slipped both ways and reversed its sense of motion by ridge jumping. To resolve this issue and better determine the spreading history of the Troodos ophiolite we present new field observations from the transform tectonized area, and reexamine existing evidence for the sense of slip of the transform. Although we find evidence for both sinistral and dextral shear along the fault zone while in an oceanic environment, the overwhelming indications are for dextral <b>slip.</b> Genuine sinistral-slip <b>indicators</b> are restricted to a few mylonitic shear zones, of limited extent, which can be related to local geometrical complexities associated with intrusion of gabbroic plutons into the transform zone. There is no need to invoke wholesale reversals of slip along the transform fault, nor, therefore, the radical reorganizations of the Troodos spreading system that have previously been proposed...|$|R

40|$|Many of {{our daily}} {{activities}} are achieved through goal-oriented routines which illustrates the adaptability and efficiency of information processing. Nevertheless, slips of action do occur. This {{study was designed to}} determine if slips of action can be induced in a well learned task and if so, how these <b>slips</b> affect specific <b>indicators</b> of task performance. Thirty (12 male) right-handed undergraduate participants were taught, with arrow cues, a sequence of dominant hand movements. Following this learning phase, a portion of the sequences were altered by either changing the spatial location of the arrow cue or by changing the actual movement goal. Results revealed that participants made numerous action slips which were most prevalent when the movement goal was altered. This suggests that participants were unable to disengage their expected movement plan and thus were vulnerable to errors. In addition to exploring the frequency of action slips we also looked at participants’ reaction and movement times on trials that preceded and followed errors and found that a speed-accuracy trade-off could not account for the slips. We also showed that frequency of slips on our task could reliably predict performance on the SART, a measure of inhibitory control, and the frequency of attention failures in daily living on the ARCES. Overall, {{the results of this study}} reveal that action slips can be induced by manipulating a well learned action routine and that the frequency of these induced slips reflects a participant’s tendency to commit action slips in everyday life...|$|R
40|$|Extravehicular {{activity}} (EVA), or spacewalks allows astronauts {{to accomplish}} {{some of the}} most important endeavors in space history. The importance of EVA will continue to increase as people venture further into our solar system. The spacesuit, used to protect the astronaut during EVA, is an anthropomorphic spacecraft that provides the physical environment a person needs to survive in the harsh environment of space. Although the suits are safe and effective, the pressurized suit becomes rigid in the vacuum of space, causing the astronaut to waste energy. Mechanical counterpressure (MCP) suits offer an alternative to gas pressurized suits by using elastic garments to provide pressure against the skin. Despite their many advantages, MCP suits are very difficult to put on, or don, making them infeasible for use today. A network of gas pressurized tubes is proposed as a solution to the donning problem. When pressurized, the tubes expand to become rigid, opening the MCP garment in the process. The system was modeled and a functional prototype was developed using a novel construction process. The model can be used as a design tool for future designs and the prototype serves as a proof-of-concept for this solution to the donning problem. The spectacular feats accomplish through spacewalks and space exploration inspire students to pursue an interest and career in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). Since its inception, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has been dedicated to educating the public about its compelling mission, fascinating discoveries, and the complicated technologies it develops. However, as the United States <b>slips</b> in <b>indicators</b> of student performance in STEM subjects, many look toward informal education, or education that occurs outside the classroom, to spur interest in STEM subjects. To maximize educational outcomes, NASA has developed a strategic framework to guide its educational programs. This framework is analyzed in the context of strategic management literature and suggests that the framework could be more easily implemented if NASA were to refine its education structure using the strengths of each of its directorates. The proposed framework was implemented in an informal education project and evaluated to determine if a projects implemented under the framework achieves the intended learning objectives.

50|$|Yaw {{refers to}} the {{direction}} in which the nose of the aircraft is pointing. It is the left-right movement of the nose across the horizon. It is possible for the nose of the aircraft to be pointing in a different direction from that in which the aircraft is moving. This usually occurs in a turn, and is called slip (if the aircraft is moving sideways into the turn) or skid (if it is moving outwards). Yaw is almost impossible to detect by visual references. In fixed-wing aircraft it is detected by references to the <b>slip</b> <b>indicator.</b> Gliders usually have a piece of string mounted in the pilot's vision which indicates airflow over the glider, and is called the yaw string.|$|E
5000|$|With ailerons in {{the neutral}} position, the wing {{on the outside}} of the turn {{develops}} more lift than the opposite wing due to the variation in airspeed across the wing span, which tends to cause the aircraft to continue to roll. Once the desired angle of bank (degree of rotation about the longitudinal axis) has been obtained, the pilot uses opposite aileron to prevent the angle of bank from increasing due to this variation in lift across the wing span. This minor opposite use of the control must be maintained throughout the turn. The pilot also uses a slight amount of rudder in the same direction as the turn to counteract adverse yaw and to produce a [...] "coordinated" [...] turn wherein the fuselage is parallel to the flight path. A simple gauge on the instrument panel called the <b>slip</b> <b>indicator,</b> also known as [...] "the ball", indicates when this coordination is achieved.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, the <b>slip</b> <b>indicator</b> was {{designed}} and constructed {{for the purpose of}} monitoring the slippage of the tractor powered wheel during the operation of plowing and of applying the output signal to control the draft force acting on the plow. In the previous work conducted by one of the authors, two AC generators were attached to front and rear wheels of the tractor to detect their rotational speed, and the slippage was calculated from the output voltage signal proportional to the rotational speed of the wheels. In the use of this type of slip sensor, some difficulty was found in adjusting and resetting the voltage corresponding to the zero slippage, depending on the running gear prior to the operation. A different type of slip sensor was therefore designed and constructed to remedy this disadvantage. The photo-electric type pulse generator was used to detect the rotational speed of both front and rear wheels through the mechanical amplification by use of gears to obtain the required numbers of pulses per unit rotation of the wheel. The number of pulses generated from the wheels was converted to the frequency and then to the voltage. This output voltage was compared to the set voltage which corresponds to the set slippage. In turn this is properly determined from the relationship between the slippage and the pulling froce expressing the different shape due to the soil condition and running device. The difference between the output voltage and set voltage was amlified. Then the relay connected to the hydraulic directional valve to control lifting and lowering the implement mounted on the three point linkage moved on off, depending on the voltage difference. The slippage calculated from the difference indicated through the monitoring device mounted on the platform located in front of operator's seat. This monitoring device worked quite satisfactorily to help the operator in knowing how much draft force was acting on the implement through the indicated value of the slippage. The field test was done to validate the accurate response and action of the implement under slip draft control in two kinds of fields, sandy and paddy, after harvesting of rice. Through the satisfactory result of the field experiments, it was observed that this type of slip draft control system described here would be possible to apply to a commercial tractor without much modification and improvements. No problems of cost, accuracy or durability for practical use were found...|$|E
