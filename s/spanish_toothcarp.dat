50|$|The <b>Spanish</b> <b>toothcarp</b> is {{characteristic}} of the Iberian peninsula, and extends from the Aigüamolls of Alt Empordà to Lake Agra in Almería. In the last two decades, the <b>Spanish</b> <b>toothcarp</b> has suffered a severe decline, {{due in part to}} destruction of suitable habitats. Only a few dozen isolated populations are known.|$|E
50|$|<b>Spanish</b> <b>toothcarp</b> inhabit shallow, slow-moving {{bodies of}} water such as river-mouths, coastal lakes, and ponds. They occur in saline and fresh water alike, due {{to their ability to}} {{tolerate}} high levels of salinity: they are euryhaline. The <b>Spanish</b> <b>toothcarp</b> can tolerate temperatures of 10 - 32 C, and pH levels between 6.5 and 7.5.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Spanish</b> <b>toothcarp</b> is an omnivore, {{and eats}} insects, crustaceans, worms and algae. Generally, toothcarps travel in small groups, staying near {{underwater}} vegetation, where they normally go unnoticed.|$|E
50|$|Despite being {{distributed}} over a {{large area}} on the peninsula, the <b>Spanish</b> <b>toothcarp</b> is largely found in small, threatened areas. Because of this, the Spanish Ministero de Medio Ambiente lists it as an endangered species.|$|E
50|$|The {{lifespan}} of a <b>Spanish</b> <b>toothcarp</b> is short. They reach {{sexual maturity}} at age three months. The females spawn repeatedly each season, producing from 100 to 900 eggs. Toothcarps in the Murcia region tend to spawn between April and August, while more northerly populations, {{such as those}} in the Delta del Ebro, lay their eggs between May and August. Spawning is usually done in areas with nearby vegetation, which shelters the eggs.|$|E
50|$|The {{biology of}} the <b>Spanish</b> <b>toothcarp</b> is {{characterized}} by a high growth rate, early maturity, a high reproductive rate, multiple periods of egg-laying and a short lifespan. From an evolutionary ecology point of view, this lifestyle is highly adaptive for fish that live in unstable environments, such as estuaries, where unpredictable conditions increase mortality. This strategy allows the toothcarp to exploit environmentally favorable conditions during the short intervals in which they occur, thereby revitalizing the population.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Spanish</b> <b>toothcarp</b> (Aphanius iberus), {{also known}} as the Spanish pupfish or Iberian killifish, is a small, endemic species of fish in the family Cyprinodontidae. Its risk of {{extinction}} {{is one of the greatest}} of any Iberian vertebrate. Its limited range, coupled with the drastic population decline the species has suffered in the last two decades, has caused it to be placed on endangered species lists, both in Spain and internationally. Its conservation status in the south of the Iberian peninsula has notably worsened.|$|E
50|$|Between {{the animal}} species it is {{necessary}} to emphasize some threatened or endangered ones like the peregrine falcon, the Eurasian eagle-owl, the golden eagle and the Bonelli's eagle, the Spur-thighed Tortoise, the Greater Horseshoe Bat and, especially, the <b>Spanish</b> <b>toothcarp,</b> an endemic fish to south-eastern Spain. In addition, the presence of the common chameleon (the only chameleon in Europe) has been documented for about 30 years, although it is not clear if it is a native or introduced species. Besides the previous ones, there are also present the greater flamingo, the red fox, the European rabbit, the European badger, the Beech marten, the common genet, the wildcat and the wild boar.|$|E
50|$|Various aquatic species {{exist in}} the lagoons such as eels, grey mullet, fresh water shrimp and above all the <b>Spanish</b> <b>toothcarp</b> which is endemic to the Spanish Mediterranean region. But without any doubt the parks best known feature is the bird life. The most notable of the many species present in the park are the marbled duck and the white-headed duck with the park {{containing}} two of the largest worldwide populations. A large number of herons are present during the breeding season particularly the purple heron, the night heron and the squacco heron. It is also possible to find other species such as the avocet, the black-winged stilt, the collared pratincole, the crested coot, the European penduline tit and the moustached warbler. Birds of prey include osprey, marsh harrier and (in winter) greater spotted eagle. An Estonia-born greater spotted eagle wearing a transmitter has been hibernating {{in the park and}} its surroundings each winter since 2008/2009.|$|E
40|$|In the Ebro Delta coastal lagoons, one of {{the main}} {{anthropogenic}} pressures is the artificial freshwater input. Each coastal lagoon has different water management schemes causing profound changes in its physicochemical characteristics. The main objective of this water management is to favour some bird species with interest either for conservation or hunting activities. The present study assesses the influence of hydrological alteration on the fish assemblages of three coastal lagoons in the Ebro Delta. The small-bodied fish fauna was mainly composed of five families: Gobiidae, Poecilidae, Cyprinodontidae, Atherinidae and Mugilidae. Salinity was found to be the main factor structuring fish community in the lagoons. The dominant species was the common goby (Pomatochistus microps) when the lagoons reached higher salinity values, whereas the invasive eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) dominated during the period of higher freshwater inputs. The juveniles of the family Mugilidae showed low catch per unit effort, especially during the period of lower salinity. This same pattern was found for the endangered <b>Spanish</b> <b>toothcarp</b> (Aphanius iberus). Overall, introduced species were favoured by low salinity, which highlights the importance of changing the present water management by reducing the freshwater inputs in order to maintain suitable levels of salinity to favour native species that are important for both commercial and conservation purposes...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} first {{data on the}} use of {{occasionally}} inundated habitats in a Mediterranean coastal lagoon by the <b>Spanish</b> <b>toothcarp</b> (Aphanius iberus), a cyprinodontid fish in danger of extinction. During a flooding period, we sampled the fish population and the macroinvertebrate community in three contrasting habitats: mats of green algae, open water, and a habitat dominated by glasswort (Salicornia patula) that is occasionally inundated. The three habitats displayed strong variation in density and species composition of invertebrates in the water column and the benthos. In general, algal mats had higher invertebrate biomasses, but glasswort had higher diversity of organisms, in part of terrestrial origin. The density of toothcarp was very low in the open water. The habitat that is occasionally inundated (glasswort) significantly had the highest density of mature toothcarp, while immature fish were similarly abundant in the glasswort and algal mat habitats. Condition (weight-length relationship) and total food biomass in the gut contents of immature toothcarp was significantly higher in algal mats than in glasswort, whereas there were no such differences for mature fish. Therefore, the occasionally flooded habitat (glasswort) was positively selected by large mature toothcarp but seemed a disadvantageous habitat for immature individualsFinancial support was provided by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology (REN 2003 - 00477), the Government of Catalonia (Catalan Government Distinction Award for university research 2004 to EGB) and a LIFE-Nature project (LIFE 99 NAT/E/ 00 6386...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} ontogenetic diet shift and prey electivity of an {{endangered}} cyprinodontid fish endemic to the Iberian Peninsula, the <b>Spanish</b> <b>toothcarp</b> (Aphanius iberus). The toothcarp’s diet was omnivorous, dominated by harpacticoid copepods (Mesochra lilljeborgi and Tisbe longicornis), copepod nauplii and detritus. Diet composition varied greatly among habitats, depending on prey availability. In a rarely inundated habitat (glasswort), {{there was more}} consumption of the isopod Protracheoniscus occidentalis and the harpacticoid copepod Mesochra lilljeborgi, while in algal mats another harpacticoid (Tisbe longicornis), chironomid dipterans and invertebrate eggs were more important in diet. Although a benthic feeding habitat has previously been suggested, in our study the diet was based rather on water column organisms for both glasswort and algal mat habitats. There was also an ontogenetic diet shift, with an increase of mean prey length with fish length, clearly linked to a microhabitat change. Smaller fish showed positive electivity and greater reliance on planktonic prey (e. g. copepod nauplii, the harpacticoid copepods Mesochra lilljeborgi and Tisbe longicornis, the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis, and ostracods), while larger fish elected and preyed on more benthic organisms (e. g. Canuella perplexa, Mesochra rapiens, and ephydrid dipterans) Financial support {{was provided by the}} Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology (REN 2002 - 10059 -E and REN 2003 - 00477) and the Ministry of Universities, Research and Information Society (DURSI), the Government of Catalonia (Catalan Government Distinction Award for university research 2004 to EGB).

40|$|Actualment una de les {{principals}} amenaces a la biodiversitat és la introducció d'espècies. Revisant 26 variables de les 69 espècies de peixos continental de la Península Ibèrica concloem que la filogènia, variabilitat i els usos de l'home són necessaris per entendre millor les diferències entres les espècies natives i invasores. Entre les especies més afectades per la introducció de peixos es troben els ciprinodontiformes endèmics del Mediterrani. Aportem les primers dades sobre l'ús d'hàbitats ocasionalment inundats i la selecció de preses del fartet (Aphanius iberus), observant un canvi ontogenètic, clarament relacionat amb el microhàbitat. També demostrem que la salinitat influeix en l'èxit invasor de la gamúsia, afectant la seva densitat i biologia reproductiva. Per altra banda, demostrem experimentalment que amb l'increment de salinitat la gambúsia disminueix la seva agressivitat i captura menys preses, reduint la seva eficàcia competitiva respecte dels ciprinodonts natius. One of {{the main}} current threats to biodiversity is the introduction of invasive species. By reviewing 26 life-history and ecological variables of the 69 inland fish species of the Iberian Peninsula we conclude that phylogeny, variability and human use are needed {{to a better understanding}} of the differences between native and invasive species. Among the most threatened species by invasive fish are the Mediterranean endemic cyprinodontiform fish. We report the first data on the use of occasionally-inundated habitats ad prey electivity by the <b>Spanish</b> <b>toothcarp</b> (Aphanius iberus). We observed an ontogenetic diet shift clearly linked to a microhabitat change. We also demonstrate that salinity limits the invasive success of mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), affecting density and life history traits. ON the ohter hand, we experimentally demonstrate that mosquitofish decreases its aggresive behavior and capture less prey, reducing its competitive efficiency with salinity increases regarding to native ciprinodonts...|$|E
40|$|Eutrophication {{is one of}} {{the major}} threats to {{freshwater}} biodiversity with important ramifications for ecosystem functions and the benefits they provide to society. One of the first visible effects of eutrophication is elevated water turbidity, which reduces the aesthetic appeal of water bodies. Also, turbidity limits organisms’ response to visual cues, which can alter species interactions including prey-consumer relationships. For visual predators, such as most fish, turbidity acts as anti-predation refugee for their prey. This loss of the top-down control can trigger multi-trophic impacts with potential collateral effects such as the proliferation of pests. The mosquito Culex pipiens {{is one of the}} most common mosquito species in eutrophic waters where its larvae are favoured by the organic matter enrichment (e. g. microalgae, bacteria and other fine particles). Since mosquitoes are annoying insects for public, and some species are vectors of diseases, mosquito control is a major interest for administration. In many temperate countries, including Spain, this led to the introduction of the eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), one of the world’s 100 worst invasive species. However, this practice is now illegal after the enforcement of new legislation. In an attempt to demonstrate that native species can be as effective as G. holbrooki for mosquito control, this study examined the efficacy of G. holbrooki and the endangered <b>Spanish</b> <b>toothcarp</b> (Aphanius iberus). Specifically, we compared the voracity and total biomass of larvae consumed by the two fish species along a turbidity gradient, simulating phytoplankton and fine sediment levels observed in eutrophic waters. Our results support the replacement of G. holbrooki with A. iberus for mosquito larval control despite indicate the major voracity of the former in all treatments. In conclusion, this study suggests that the introduction of G. holbrooki was perhaps unnecessary for mosquito biocontrol in areas inhabited by A. iberus...|$|E
40|$|The {{hydrological}} connectivity {{between the}} salt marsh {{and the sea}} was partially restored in a Mediterranean wetland containing isolated ponds resulting from former salt extraction and aquaculture activities. A preliminary assessment provided evidence that ponds farther from the sea hosted very large numbers of the endangered <b>Spanish</b> <b>toothcarp,</b> Aphanius iberus, suggesting that individuals had been trapped and consequently reach unnaturally high densities. In order to achieve both habitat rehabilitation and toothcarp conservation, {{efforts were made to}} create a gradient of hydrologically connected areas, including isolated fish reservoirs, semi-isolated, and connected salt marsh-sea areas that could allow migratory movements of fish and provide some protection for A. iberus. The fish community was monitored prior to, and for three years after rehabilitation. Results showed {{an increase in the number}} of fish species within semi-isolated areas (Zone A), whereas areas adjacent to the sea (Zone B) increased the number of marine species and decreased that of estuarine species (ES). Yet overall differences in fish assemblages were much higher between zones than among study years. Generalized linear models (GLMs) evidenced that distance to the sea was the most important variable explaining the local diversity of the fish community after restoration, with occasional influence of other factors such as temperature, and depth. The abundance of A. iberus was consistently higher in semi-isolated areas at greater distances from the sea, but a decline occurred in both zones and in isolated reservoir ponds after restoration efforts, which may be attributable to interannual differences in recruitment success and, to a lesser extent, to dispersal into adjacent habitats. A negative effect of restoration works on fish population cannot be excluded, but the final outcome of the intervention likely needs a longer period...|$|E
