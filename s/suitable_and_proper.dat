60|$|In the {{preceding}} argument for universal but graduated suffrage, I have taken no account of difference of sex. I consider {{it to be}} as entirely irrelevant to political rights as difference in height or in {{the color of the}} hair. All human beings have the same interest in good government; the welfare of all is alike affected by it, and they have equal need of a voice in it to secure their share of its benefits. If there be any difference, women require it more than men, since, being physically weaker, they are more dependent on law and society for protection. Mankind have long since abandoned the only premises which will support the conclusion that women ought not to have votes. No one now holds that women should be in personal servitude; that they should have no thought, wish, or occupation but to be the domestic drudges of husbands, fathers, or brothers. It is allowed to unmarried, and wants but little of being conceded to married women to hold property, and have pecuniary and business interests {{in the same manner as}} men. It is considered <b>suitable</b> <b>and</b> <b>proper</b> that women should think, and write, and be teachers. As soon as these things are admitted, the political disqualification has no principle to rest on. The whole mode of thought of the modern world is, with increasing emphasis, pronouncing against the claim of society to decide for individuals what they are and are not fit for, and what they shall and shall not be allowed to attempt. If the principles of modern politics and political economy are good for any thing, it is for proving that these points can only be rightly judged of by the individuals themselves; and that, under complete freedom of choice, wherever there are real diversities of aptitude, the greater number will apply themselves to the things for which they are on the average fittest, and the exceptional course will only be taken by the exceptions. Either the whole tendency of modern social improvements has been wrong, or it ought to be carried out to the total abolition of all exclusions and disabilities which close any honest employment to a human being.|$|E

Methods: A prospective cohort study with patients attending an RA outpatient clinic was conducted. Participants were consecutively recruited between March 2006 and June 2007 and were followed through December 2013. Data on DMARD use (prevalences, doses and escalation rates), DAS 28, HAQ and radiographic progression were compared among RA patients with FM and without FM. Mistreatment clinical scenarios were allegedly identified and compared between groups. Results: 256 RA patients (32 with FM) were followed for 6. 2 ± 2. 0 (mean ± SD) years comprising 2986 visits. At baseline, RA duration was 11. 1 ± 7. 4 years. DAS 28 and HAQ were greater in RA with FM group, and were closer to RA without FM group towards the end. RA patients with FM used higher doses of tricyclic antidepressants, leflunomide and prednisone, and lower doses of methotrexate. When compared to RA patients without FM, participants with RA and FM used more often tricyclic antidepressants, leflunomide, prednisone, continuous analgesics and less often methotrexate. Groups presented similar 7 -year biologic-free survival, and radiographic progression-free survival in Cox regression. RA patients with FM had greater proportions of visits in mistreatment scenarios when compared to RA patients without FM (28. 4 vs. 19. 8 %, p < 0. 001). Conclusions: RA patients with FM used more leflunomide and prednisone, and RA mistreatment was more frequent in FM patients.

40|$|Abstract Hygiene plays a very {{important}} role in our lives. It is often influenced by social, cultural, family and individual factors, as well as by knowledge about health and hygiene. The skin of a child is very soft and sensitive, and therefore requires careful and considerate care throughout the whole period of childhood, especially in the neonatal period and infancy. Skin care of newborns and infants is an essential attribute of the child?s health care. Such care is an individual matter, and it will always depend on family circumstances in which the child lives and on a <b>suitable</b> <b>and</b> <b>proper</b> approach of parents and physicians. The aim of this thesis was to determine the level of knowledge of mothers and the use of such knowledge in skin care of newborns and infants at home. The second objective was to prepare educational material for mothers. The thesis makes use of the questionnaire method. For this purpose, 274 questionnaires were collected. The questionnaire was distributed to mothers of newborns and infants, who take care of their skin at home. The investigation was carried out at pediatrics in the South Bohemian and Pilsen regions. The results of the research are introduced using graphs and some of the results are statistically evaluated by a chi-square test. Two hypotheses were set. Hypothesis 1 : Mothers have enough information regarding the skin care of newborns and infants at home. Hypothesis 2 : Mothers correctly use the acquired information about skin care of newborns and infants. We were successful in answering both hypotheses in the research study. The analysis and evaluation of the questionnaires shows that mothers are knowledgeable in treating skin of their children in the neonatal period and infancy. However, we managed to prove that some information of the parents is inconsistent with the literature. Therefore an educational material for mothers was created, focusing on skin care of newborns and infants. This educational booklet may be used at pediatric wards...|$|E
30|$|Traditional theory {{holds that}} the statuses of {{multiple}} principals are similar, but the authority statuses of different Chinese state agencies vary greatly, which show a differentiated authority of the party committee > government > functional bureaus. Seeing {{from the perspective of}} authority, the local government and bureau consider the higher-level party committee to have real authority, the higher-level government has formal authority, and higher functional bureaus only have symbolic authority (Aghion and Tirole 1997; Zhou and Lian 2011). Seeing from the perspective of authority relations, the higher-level party committee has absolute leadership authority over the local government; accordingly, the other two major principals have administrative authority and professional authority over the local government, respectively. It is worth noting that the relationship between the party committee and the government has adjusted back and forth several times. At the beginning of the founding of new China, by emphasizing the separation of the party and the government, the party committee tended to avoid affecting government bureaus. However, in 1953, the Party Central Committee began to strengthen its leadership over government bureaus (He and Kong 2011). In 1958, Chairman Mao Zedong also stressed the party’s leadership and principles and put forward the idea of “centralizing power on major issues and decentralizing power on minor issues; the party committee makes decisions, the government carries them out” (Party Literature Research Center of the CPC Central Committee 1993, 355). After 1987, with an emphasis on the separation of the party and the government, the power of the party committee significantly decreased, such as the revocation of party committees and the politics and law committee, and the revocation of party organizations in government bureaus (Zhao 2013). In recent years, the party committee has regained its power over the government. Accordingly, the business cards of government officials previously listed their government position first, but now list their party position first. In general, the party committee and the government are collectively referred to as government. However, from the above-mentioned historical evolution, they have strong heterogeneity and different authorities. Viewing the party committee and government as two independent variables is thus <b>suitable</b> <b>and</b> <b>proper</b> since they have different roles in China’s state governance.|$|E

Human t-PA is a serine-protease enzyme containing 527 amino acid residues in five structural domains. The correct folding of t-PA requires the correct pairing of 17 disulfide bridges in the molecule. A gene encoding full-length human t-PA was cloned into pPICZαA expression vector downstream of alcohol oxidase promoter and α-mating signal sequence from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and flush with the kex 2 cleavage site to express the protein with a native N terminus. The methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris GS 115 strain, was transformed with this cassette, and methanol utilizing (mut+) transformants were selected for production and secretion of human t-PA into culture media.

Herein, in situ grown carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on carbon paper as a gas diffusion layer (GDL) were fabricated by a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) process. Fuel cells using CNT-based GDLs with nickel (II) nitrate loading of 1. 6 mg cm(- 2) show better performance compared with the GDLs which employ Vulcan XC- 72 as the MPL. The pore size distribution and the gas permeability results revealed that the increasing density of CNT layer had two main effects on the pore structure of GDL: firstly, the increasing density of CNT layer decreased the macro pore volume and the open through pore volume of CNT-based GDL; secondly, the increasing density of CNT layer decreased the micro pore diameter of CNT-based GDL. The data obtained from the vapor permeability and the fuel cell performance tests indicated that the water flooding can be reduced by applying CNT-based GDLs. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) confirmed that the CNT-based GDL can effectively promote the mass transfer in the FCs which was attributed to its <b>suitable</b> hydrophobicity <b>and</b> <b>proper</b> structure.
