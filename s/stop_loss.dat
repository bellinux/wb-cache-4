25|$|Sony has {{modified}} the DSLR formula {{in favor of}} single-lens translucent (SLT) cameras, which are still technically DSLRs, but feature a fixed mirror that allows most light through to the sensor while reflecting some light to the autofocus sensor. Sony's SLTs feature full-time phase detection autofocus during video recording as well as continuous shooting of up to 12 frame/s. The α series, whether traditional SLRs or SLTs, offers in-body sensor-shift image stabilization and retains the Minolta AF lens mount. , the lineup included the Alpha 68, the semipro Alpha 77 II, and the professional full-frame Alpha 99 II. The translucent (transmissive) fixed mirror allows 70 percent of the light to pass through onto the imaging sensor, meaning a 1/3rd <b>stop</b> <b>loss</b> light, {{but the rest of}} this light is continuously reflected onto the camera's phase detection AF sensor for fast autofocus for both the viewfinder and live view on the rear screen, even during video and continuous shooting. The reduced number of moving parts also makes for faster shooting speeds for its class. This arrangement means that the SLT cameras use an electronic viewfinder as opposed to an optical viewfinder, which some consider a disadvantage, but does have the advantage of a live preview of the shot with current settings, anything displayed on the rear screen is displayed on the viewfinder, and handles bright situations well.|$|E

40|$|The {{disposition}} {{effect is}} an investment bias where investors hold stocks at a loss longer than stocks at a gain. This bias is associated with poorer investment performance and exhibited {{to a greater extent}} by investors with less experience and less sophistication. A method of managing susceptibility to the bias is through use of <b>stop</b> <b>losses.</b> Using the trading records of UK stock market individual investors from 2006 to 2009, this paper shows that <b>stop</b> <b>losses</b> used as part of investment decisions are an effective tool for inoculating against the disposition effect.

50|$|Many {{employers}} seek {{to mitigate}} the financial risk of self funding claims under the plan by purchasing <b>stop</b> <b>loss</b> insurance from an insurance carrier. These policies typically provide for risk retention limitations both on a specific claim and aggregate claims basis. An important aspect of self funded group health plans lies in the requirement that the employer remain liable for funding of plan claims regardless of the purchase of <b>stop</b> <b>loss</b> insurance. What this means, in turn, is a fund or company's own bank account creates a pool of their employees and is managed & distributed to claim payouts. In other words, only the employer has a contractual relationship with plan participants and beneficiaries. The <b>stop</b> <b>loss</b> policy runs solely between the employer and the <b>stop</b> <b>loss</b> carrier and creates no direct liability to those individuals covered under the plan. This feature provides the critical distinction between fully insured plans (subject to State law insurance regulations) and self funded health plans which, under the provisions of Section 514 of ERISA, are exempt from state insurance regulations.|$|E

The critical question technical analysis has to answer therefore becomes, does technical analysis (TA) provide an investor with an edge in the stock market? To answer this question empirically data was investigated for the Standard and Poor’s- 500 Index for a twenty years time period from 1986 to 2006. Two different portfolios were constructed. The portfolios were named Hugin with a high time resolution a Munin with a lower time resolution. A simple 30 period MA cross strategy with optimized stop-losses were tested on the two portfolios. The stop-losses were optimized on the first ten years 1986 - 1996 in order to make the backtesting more realistic. The conclusion was that neither Hugin nor did Munin produce abnormal returns without the optimized <b>stop</b> <b>losses.</b> When the <b>stop</b> <b>losses</b> were optimized, Hugin but not Munin provided an investor with slightly better return than a long position. However Hugin’s returns were highly sensitive to the assumed level of price slippage and transaction costs.
