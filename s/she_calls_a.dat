5|$|Ann {{comes to}} Leslie's house, and finds it full of stacks of boxes, papers and garbage. When they find {{themselves}} unable to clean it, Leslie calls Maria Portlesman (Bonita Friedericy), who teaches cleaning courses at the recreation center. She declines payment and hints she would prefer preferential treatment when Leslie cuts the classes, despite Leslie's assurance this will not happen. When Leslie realizes she has not prepared any food for the party, <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> culinary teacher from the recreation center. Later, at the party, Andy complains about Justin to April (Aubrey Plaza), who makes Andy happy when she proposes putting chewed up gum in Justin's pockets. Eventually, Tom's ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) arrives. Tom expresses anger that Leslie invited her, especially because Ron is romantically interested in her. When Ron impresses Wendy by eating a hot red pepper, Tom attempts to eat a bigger one, but has {{to run to the}} bathroom in pain immediately. When Justin starts yawning, a worried Leslie calls in other recreation center teachers to make the party more interesting, including a belly-dancer, a fencer, a cartoonist and an origami teacher.|$|E

[...] Wilson adds that Acton has both honesty and reticence: she does not [...] "gush" [...] when she really likes something, [...] "but puts it in brackets, as if holding her {{emotions}} in. 'Lemon Dumplings (Light and Good)', for example. Or 'Mushrooms Au Beurre (Delicious)'... that makes her Eliza Acton (The Best)." ...|$|E
500|$|Theodore {{meets with}} Catherine at a {{restaurant}} to sign the divorce papers and he mentions Samantha. Appalled {{that he can be}} romantically attached to what <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> [...] "computer," [...] Catherine accuses Theodore of being unable to deal with real human emotions. Her accusations linger in his mind. Sensing that something is amiss, Samantha suggests using a sex surrogate, Isabella, who would simulate Samantha {{so that they can be}} physically intimate. Theodore reluctantly agrees, but is overwhelmed by the strangeness of the experience. Terminating the encounter, he sends a distraught Isabella away, causing tension between himself and Samantha.|$|E

500|$|After {{the long}} period between Licence to Kill and GoldenEye, the {{producers}} brought in Dame Judi Dench {{to take over}} as the new M replacing Robert Brown. The character is based on Stella Rimington, the real-life head of MI5 between 1992 and 1996. For GoldenEye, Dench's M is cold, blunt and initially dislikes Bond, whom <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> [...] "sexist, misogynist dinosaur, {{a relic of the}} Cold War." [...] Tanner, her Chief of Staff, refers to her during the film as [...] "the Evil Queen of Numbers", given her reputation at that stage for relying on statistics and analysis rather than impulse and initiative.|$|E
500|$|While {{searching for}} {{inspiration}} for an idea, Leslie reads from her dream journal and recalls a dream where she happily married ALF, the alien protagonist of {{a science fiction}} sitcom of the same name. Later, Leslie listens to the Len song [...] "Steal My Sunshine", which <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> one-hit wonder and compares to her own lack of ability {{to come up with}} a second idea. Ben cheers Leslie up and compliments her work ethic by calling her the [...] "Energizer Bunny of city government." [...] During a later scene, Tom mockingly calls Ben the [...] "white Urkel", a reference to the archetype nerd character Steve Urkel from the comedy series Family Matters. Donna can be seen reading a book called Your Erogenous Zones.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{creates a}} number of {{binaries}} between men and women. Michelle Phillips Buchberger argues that The French Lieutenant's Woman, along with Fowles two earlier novels The Collector (1963) and The Magus (1965), portrays a fundamental binary between {{the male and female}} characters: the female characters act as an elite set of [...] "creators" [...] or [...] "educated, visionary, and predominantly female" [...] characters who provide the facilitation for evolution [...] "in existential terms" [...] of the male [...] "'collectors', whose traits are present in all of Fowles's flawed male protagonists." [...] Though acknowledging such binaries {{in the role of the}} characters, critic Alice Ferrebe does not treat these binaries as necessary thematic elements. Rather, the binaries demonstrate what <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> gendered [...] "scopic politics", or a politics created by a gaze (not dissimilar from the [...] "male gaze" [...] noticed in cinema studies), that constructs an artificial gender binary within Fowle's early novels (as opposed to a multiplicity of socially constructed genders). For Ferrebe, this binary creates a tension, especially with Sarah, who becomes a violently fetishised and objectified [...] "other", differentiated from the male characters like Charles.|$|E

2500|$|Hutchison, who {{identifies}} as pro-life, has a mixed voting record on abortion rights. She has voted to restrict abortion rights, but {{has said that}} she does not favor overturning Roe v. Wade and that the Republican Party should not built its platform around abortion, which <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> [...] "personal and religious issue." [...] During her time in the U.S. Senate, Hutchison received consistently high scores from the National Right to Life Committee and consistently low scores from NARAL Pro-Choice America.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, only The Leaky Cauldron was honored. In Rowling's words, [...] "it {{is about}} the worst kept secret on this website that I am {{a huge fan of}} The Leaky Cauldron," [...] which <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> [...] "wonderfully well {{designed}} mine of accurate information on all things Harry Potter." [...] On another occasion, Rowling has called the Leaky Cauldron her [...] "favourite fan site." [...] In 2006, the Brazilian website Potterish was the only site honoured, in recognition of its [...] "style, [...] Potter-expertise and [...] responsible reporting." ...|$|E

2500|$|With {{the rise}} of the feminist {{movement}} in the twentieth century, reactions to the play have tended to become more divergent. For some critics, [...] "Kate's taming was no longer as funny as it had been [...] her domination became, in George Bernard Shaw's words 'altogether disgusting to modern sensibility'." [...] Addressing the relationship between A Shrew and The Shrew from a political perspective, for example, Leah S. Marcus very much believes the play to be what it seems. She argues A Shrew is an earlier version of The Shrew, but acknowledges that most scholars reject the idea that A Shrew was written by Shakespeare. She believes {{one of the reasons for}} this is because A Shrew [...] "hedges the play's patriarchal message with numerous qualifiers that do not exist in" [...] The Shrew. <b>She</b> <b>calls</b> <b>A</b> Shrew a more [...] "progressive" [...] text than The Shrew, and argues that scholars tend to dismiss the idea that A Shrew is Shakespearean because [...] "the women are not as satisfactorily tamed as they are in The Shrew." [...] She also points out that if A Shrew is an early draft, it suggests Shakespeare [...] "may have increased rather than decreased the patriarchal violence of his materials", something which, she believes, scholars find difficult to accept.|$|E

60|$|That evening Mary {{was again}} {{walking on the}} towing-path beside the river with her cousin Walter. She had met him now about five times, and there was already an {{intimacy}} between them. The idea of cousinly intimacy to girls is undoubtedly very pleasant; and I {{do not know whether}} it is not the fact that the better and the purer is the girl, the sweeter and the pleasanter is the idea. In America a girl may form a friendly intimacy with any young man she fancies, and though she may not be free from little jests and good-humoured joking, there is no injury to her from such intimacy. It is her acknowledged right to enjoy herself after that fashion, and to have what <b>she</b> <b>calls</b> <b>a</b> good time with young men. A dozen such intimacies do not stand in her way when there comes some real adorer who means to marry her and is able to do so. She rides with these friends, walks with them, and corresponds with them. She goes out to balls and picnics with them, and afterwards lets herself in with a latchkey, while her papa and mamma are a-bed and asleep, with perfect security. If there be much to be said against the practice, there is also {{something to be said for}} it. Girls on the other hand, on the continent of Europe, do not dream of making friendship with any man. A cousin with them is as much out of the question as the most perfect stranger. In strict families, a girl is hardly allowed to go out with her brother; and I have heard of mothers who thought it indiscreet that a father should be seen alone with his daughter at a theatre. All friendships between the sexes must, under such a social code, be looked forward to as post-nuptial joys. Here in England there is a something betwixt the two. The intercourse between young men and girls is free enough to enable the latter to feel how pleasant it is to be able to forget for awhile conventional restraints, and to acknowledge how joyous a thing it is to indulge in social intercourse in which the simple delight of equal mind meeting equal mind in equal talk is just enhanced by the unconscious remembrance that boys and girls when they meet together may learn to love. There is nothing more sweet in youth than this, nothing more natural, nothing more fitting, nothing, indeed, more essentially necessary for God's purposes with his creatures. Nevertheless, here with us, there is the restriction, and it is seldom that a girl can allow herself the full flow of friendship with a man who is not old enough to be her father, unless he is her lover as well as her friend. But cousinhood does allow some escape from the hardship of this rule. Cousins are Tom, and Jack, and George, and Dick. Cousins probably know all or most of your little family secrets. Cousins, perhaps, have romped with you, and scolded you, and teased you, when you were young. Cousins are almost the same as brothers, and yet they may be lovers. There is certainly a great relief in cousinhood.|$|E
