40|$|The basic aim of {{this article}} is to {{consider}} the effect of the current financial crisis on the movements and sustainability of the public debt in the period up to 2013. It is shown that changes in the public debt come from the effect of the primary deficit created, stockflow adjustment, the real growth of the GDP and real interest rates. On the basis of results of the European Communities (2009) a statistical estimate is given of the trends in the primary deficit for EU- 12, after which the model is adjusted to Croatian figures. The projection of <b>stock-flow</b> <b>adjustment</b> is undertaken from a projection of the primary deficit, due to the relatively strong negative correlation between those two variables in the past, whilst the projection of the real growth rate of the GDP and real interest rates is significantly simplified. The main hypothesis tested is that the ratio of the public debt in the GDP up to 2013 does not exceed the margin of sustainability prescribed in the Maastricht criterion of 60 %, which is finally confirmed by this analysis.

We then compare FEER and BEER estimations of equilibrium exchange rates based on the same, econometric model of the net foreign asset position, with special focus on the euro-dollar rate. These estimations suggest that, although more robust to alternative assumptions, the BEER approach may rely on excessive confidence on past behaviors in terms of portfolio allocation. Symmetrically, FEERs may underestimate the plasticity of international capital markets because they focus on the adjustment of the trade balance.

We show that the internationalization of the yuan would lessen the response of floating exchange rates to asymmetric trade shocks as well as attenuate the distortionary impact of China keeping its currency pegged to the dollar.

40|$|Over {{the past}} three decades, large and {{persistent}} discrepancies between the annual change in public debt and the budget deficit, so-called <b>stock-flow</b> <b>adjustments,</b> were a prominent feature of debt dynamics in many economies.

Results show that such discrepancies can only be partly explained by balance sheet effects and the realization of contingent liabilities and that significant differences exist in average <b>stock-flow</b> <b>adjustments</b> across countries reflecting country-specific factors. The more fiscally transparent the country, the smaller these tend to be. The contribution of <b>stock-flow</b> <b>adjustments</b> to increases in debt is likewise smaller in countries with above average fiscal transparency.

40|$|Fiscal rules, {{such as the}} {{excessive}} deficit procedure and the stability and growth pact (SGP), aim at constraining government behavior. Milesi-Ferretti (2003) develops a model in which governments circumvent such rules by reverting to creative accounting. The amount of this creative accounting depends on the reputation cost {{for the government and}} the economic cost of sticking to the rule. In this paper, we provide empirical evidence of creative accounting in the European Union. We find that the SGP rules have induced governments to use <b>stock-flow</b> <b>adjustments,</b> a form of creative accounting, to hide deficits. This tendency to substitute <b>stock-flow</b> <b>adjustments</b> for budget deficits is especially strong for the cyclical component of the deficit, as in times of recession the cost of reducing the deficit is particularly large.

40|$|Abstract: Multicointegration, in {{the sense}} of Granger and Lee (1990), {{frequently}} occurs in models of <b>stock-flow</b> <b>adjustment</b> and implies cointegration amongst I(2) variables and their differences (polynomial cointegration). The {{purpose of this article is}} two-fold. First, we demonstrate that based on a multicointegrated vector autoregression (VAR) two equivalent error correction model (ECM) representations can be derived; the first is expressed in terms of adjustments in the flows of the variables (the standard I(2) ECM), and the second is expressed in terms of adjustments in both the stocks and the flows. Secondly, we apply I(2) estimation and testing procedures for multicointegrated time series to analyze data for US housing construction. We find that stocks of housing units started and completed exhibit polynomial cointegration (and hence the flows are multicointegrated) and the associated ECM's are estimated. Lee (1992, 1996) also found multicointegration in this data set but without explicitly exploiting the I(2) property. Cointegration, multicointegration, I(2) processes, housing construction...|$|E
40|$|This volume {{includes}} five self-contained {{chapters in}} the fields of public debt and fiscal transfer schemes. After an introduction to the topic, chapter 2 shows that the institutional setting of fiscal policy making needs to be considered when assessing the sustainability of fiscal policy. Using data for the U. S. and German state governments, the results of fiscal sustainability tests depend on whether fiscal transfers are taken into account. If fiscal transfers are not included in the primary surplus, the test results do not indicate that the U. S. and German state governments pursued sustainable fiscal policies. Chapter 3 examines whether the municipalities' voting behavior in state elections in a German state influenced the distribution of discretionary grants from the state level to the municipalities. The results show that discretionary grants were awarded to municipalities with many core supporters of the incumbent state government. In Chapter 4, a test on explosive time-series behavior is applied to the Target balances of the German Bundesbank. Chapter 5 examines whether electoral motives in OECD countries influenced 2 ̆ 01 ccreative accounting 2 ̆ 01 d by the governments as measured by <b>stock-flow</b> <b>adjustments</b> (the difference between budget deficits and the change in public debt). Governments can engage in creative accounting to hide borrowing and sugarcoat the budget balance. The results show that <b>stock-flow</b> <b>adjustments</b> increased before elections. In Germany, <b>stock-flow</b> <b>adjustments</b> chiefly occurred via the creation of off-budget special funds that governments can use to finance public activities outside the core budget. Chapter 6 describes special funds in Germany and elaborates upon the purposes for which special funds were established. It discusses {{the extent to which the}} new German debt brake limits the borrowing of special funds and explains how the debt brake can be circumvented by using special funds...|$|R

We conclude that an increase in SFA reduces long- and short-term interest rates, with higher reductions for short-term rates. Furthermore, the decreasing effects of an increment in the stock-flow have reduced since the 2008 - 2009 financial crisis.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} official fiscal data and creative accounting signals on interest rate spreads between bond yields in the European Union. Our model predicts that risk premia contained in government bond spreads should increase in both the official fiscal position and the expected “creative” part of fiscal policy. The relative importance of these two signals depends on the transparency of the country. Greater transparency reduces risk premia. The empirical results confirm the hypotheses. Creative accounting increases the spread. The increase of the risk premium is stronger if financial markets are unsure about the true extent of creative accounting.

40|$|The {{interpretation}} {{of the relation between}} a budget deficit and a government debt in the standard economic theory is based on its unilateral causality, where the government debt comes into being due to the accumulation of budget deficits. The logic of the development of the government indebtedness is, in this approach, unambiguously determined by public finance processes monitored by Parliament in the framework of the course of fiscal years. The main objective {{of this paper is to}} stress that in reality the development of government indebtedness is significantly influenced by off-budgetary factors. The presented results endorse the hypothesis that the influence of <b>stock-flow</b> <b>adjustment</b> on the development of the debt/GDP ratio in a number of cases surpasses the influence of the budget balance. This trend significantly amplifies in the period of a financial crisis in context of the massive shift of the debt burden, occurring in the course of them. stock-flow, public debt, budget deficit, adjustment...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the first truly comprehensive database on gross government-debt-to-GDP ratios, covering {{nearly the entire}} IMF membership (178 countries) and spanning an exceptionally long time period (going back to 1880 for most advanced and some emerging economies). The paper then uses the database to document the evolution of public debt ratios in advanced, emerging, and low-income economies, and relate them to contemporaneous developments in growth, commodity prices, and debt relief, respectively. Finally, the paper identifies 129 large debt increases and decreases observed in 19 advanced economies over 1880 – 2007 and decomposes them into contributions from the primary balance, the interest-growth differential, and the <b>stock-flow</b> <b>adjustment</b> term (a composite of valuation effects and “below-the-line” fiscal operations). The analysis suggests a pattern of asymmetric contributions: the primary balance {{plays a key role}} in debt reductions, except during the post-WWII period (when the growth-interest differential was extremely favorable); while debt surges were often associated with large stock-flow adjustments, likely reflecting assumption of implicit liabilities and exchange rate changes and, for the cases of debt reduction, debt default. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{working paper}} details and updates the debt {{sustainability}} analysis of Darvas, Sapir and Wolff (2014) for Greece, Ireland and Portugal. The {{goal is not}} the calculation of a baseline scenario which best corresponds to our views, but to set-up a baseline scenario which broadly corresponds to official assumptions and current market views and to assess its sensitivity to deviations from these assumptions. The simulated public debt/GDP ratios are slightly lower compared to Darvas, Sapir and Wolff (2014), eg for 2020 our new results are 2 - 3 percent of GDP lower than in our February projections. This {{is because of the}} European Commission's downward revision of the 2013 debt level for Greece and Ireland, higher expected primary surpluses in Ireland, slightly lower interest rates for all three countries, and a 1. 5 percent of GDP higher reduction in the debt ratio due to the <b>stock-flow</b> <b>adjustment</b> in 2014 - 15 for Portugal. Our findings suggests that the public debt ratio is set to decline in all three countries under the maintained assumptions, but the debt trajectory remains vulnerable to negative growth, primary balance and interest rate shocks, even though we do not examine extremely negative scenarios...|$|E
30|$|In our approach, {{we apply}} the {{criteria}} used by Alesina and Perotti (1995), but proceed backwards to detect all episodes of “successful” debt consolidation in Spain between 1990 and 2010. We start {{by identifying the}} periods where debt-to-output ratios are, at least, 5  % points below the value observed 3  years before. Then, we proceed with identifying the determinants leading to such positive debt dynamics - cyclically adjusted primary deficit, snow-ball and <b>stock-flow</b> <b>adjustments</b> (for more details on the definitions, see European-Commission 2009). Consolidation episodes are identified as active if {{the reduction in the}} cyclically-adjusted primary deficit dominates. We further analyze the budget composition in order to detect the main sources of primary balance adjustment. Finally, we use our model to mimic each consolidation process while assessing the welfare costs involved.|$|R

40|$|Almost all {{macroeconomic}} indicators change upon shocks {{influenced by the}} global financial crisis that has also spilled over to the public sector, seriously threatening fiscal sustainability. The aim {{of this paper is}} to estimate public debt sustainability in the crisis and post-crisis period from 2011 to 2015. For estimation of public debt movements, decomposition of basic flows that lead to its change will be considered, and each one will be separately modeled dynamically. It is shown that in the period up to 2015 the share of public debt in GDP in optimistic scenarios does not exceed the margin of 60 %, prescribed by the Maastricht criteria. In baseline scenarios we get two-sided results, so in the first model public debt slightly exceeds the limit of 60 % with a share of 62. 6 % of GDP in 2015, while in all other baseline scenarios public debt stays at the level of 45. 8, or 52. 5 % of GDP. Therefore, we conclude that in the medium-term period up to 2015 there is a real danger of public debt increasing over its acceptable limit and the major threats lie in contingent liabilities and exchange rate shocks, while minor vulnerability can be observed in case of real GDP growth and nominal interest rate shocks. public debt, fiscal sustainability, dynamic models, deficit, <b>stock-flow</b> <b>adjustment,</b> the Croatian economy...|$|E

(Financial Times, 5 October 2005) Under numerical fiscal rules, such as those underpinning EMU, governments have strong temptations to use accounting tricks to meet the fiscal constraints. Given these political incentives, fiscal variables that in the past were regarded as a mere residual acquire a strategic role. This is the case of the so-called <b>stock-flow</b> <b>adjustment</b> (SFA) which reconciles deficit and debt developments. We develop a simple theoretical model where deficits and two distinct SFA components (one {{that could be used to}} reduce the deficit figures and the other to impact debt figures instead) are determined as a result of a constrained optimization by fiscal authorities. Econometric evidence provides results consistent with the model findings. The SFA component related to the purpose to hide deficits rises with the recorded deficit, while the sales of financial assets designed to keep the debt under control rise with debt and deficit. Such practices have greatly contributed to the loss of credibility of EMU’s fiscal rules.

When deficits are in excess of the 3 percent limit, accounting gimmicks become more sensitive to the size of deficits. The SGP per se does not appear to increase the extent to which higher deficits trigger more accounting gimmicks. However, the SGP seems associated with a more intense use of accounting gimmicks irrespective of the level of deficit. Such accounting practices have greatly contributed to the loss of credibility of Economic and Monetary Union's fiscal rules. If properly implemented, the reformed Pact, which stresses durable adjustment and long-run sustainability, should help curb such perverse incentives.

40|$|Since the {{intensification}} {{of the financial crisis}} in September 2008 many euro area countries have provided financial support to their banking system and have adopted expansionary fiscal policies to counter the negative effects of the economic downturn.

40|$|The {{destructive}} {{potential of the}} sovereign debt crisis of the euro area has been slowly abating since last summer, but still remains considerable. One reason {{for it is the}} sheer complexity of the crisis, which brings together several harmful factors, some long-standing, others more recent, like acts of an ever-growing and mutating tragedy. It combines the features of a financial crisis in some countries with those of a balance-of-payment crisis or sluggish growth in another, overlapping group of countries. All these factors have struck Europe before, but never all at the same time, in so many countries sharing a currency, and with limited adjustment mechanisms. Some countries must undertake sizeable <b>stock-flow</b> <b>adjustments,</b> and reinvent parts of their economies. But the crisis also has two additional dimensions, one being flaws in the governance of the euro area, and the other being an erosion of trust in the viability of the euro area itself. Such concerns have led to talk of a 2 ̆ 01 cbailout union 2 ̆ 01 d, a 2 ̆ 01 cpermanent transfer union 2 ̆ 01 d, or the hegemony of a country, the lack of solidarity or of risk-sharing, the lack of vision, the risks of fiscal or financial dominance, and so on. The aim {{of this paper is to}} give expression to some thoughts on the various dimensions of the crisis without claiming to offer a coherent and conclusive view either of the crisis or the future of the euro area. While the crisis is a traumatic wake-up call, it is also a catalyst for change. Understanding the reform efforts under way will help rebalancing the views of sceptics...|$|R
