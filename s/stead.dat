5|$|After the {{revisions}} were completed, much of {{the plot}} stayed the same, but several events in the original draft were cut out to strengthen the whole book. <b>Stead</b> combined two characters into one, having a stronger outline and also cut out several scenes for minor characters. In the end, <b>Stead</b> found that the revisions helped to make the book more cohesive.|$|E

40|$|W. T. <b>Stead’s</b> {{contribution}} {{to the development of}} reader engagement in the New Journalism was extensive and innovative. In this essay, I argue that <b>Stead’s</b> participatory reader networks in the Link and the Review of Reviews were the culmination of <b>Stead’s</b> career-long interest in media-based community engagement projects. Rather than viewing <b>Stead’s</b> journalism through the narrow lens of a single publication or journalistic campaign, I consider how his participatory reader networks were refined and shaped over the course of many years and within the pages of multiple periodicals...|$|R

5|$|One of {{his most}} famous poems, Jubilate Agno, was not {{published}} until 1939, by William Force <b>Stead.</b> In 1943, lines from this poem were set to music by Benjamin Britten with the translated title Rejoice in the Lamb.|$|E
5|$|<b>Stead</b> {{began writing}} the novel in 2002, but her first draft was {{confusing}} and unorganized. To help her, she met editor Wendy Lamb who advised her {{to meet with}} a small group of people who would help critique the novel. After three years of work, <b>Stead</b> finished the second draft and met with Lamb who once again helped make improvements and later published the novel. Reviewers praised the description of Gracehope and main characters, as well as the performances of Coleen Marlo and David Ackroyd who voiced Thea and Peter in a subsequent audiobook publication of First Light.|$|E

5|$|The court {{declared}} that Hill was not validly elected at the 1998 federal election. However, {{they did not}} declare the whole election invalid, acting on an earlier decision of the court, because although no effect could be given to voters' preferences for Hill, their other preferences were not invalid, and those {{could be used to}} determine who should be elected in Hill's <b>stead.</b> The court did not reach a definite decision about what action should be taken, remitting that question to a lower court. Eventually, Len Harris, the number two candidate on the One Nation ticket, was elected in Hill's <b>stead,</b> taking up his seat on 1 July 1999.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} {{characters}} are Miranda, and the laughing man (Marcus). <b>Stead</b> began writing When You Reach Me in 2007 after reading {{an article in}} The New York Times gave her {{an idea for a}} novel about traveling in time to save someone's life. The article was about a man who woke up in Denver suffering from amnesia, having forgotten who he was or why he was there. Many people worked with the man to help him regain his memory. Under hypnosis, he spoke about his apparent wife, Penny, and two daughters who died in a car crash. However, when he and Penny reunited, the man found out she was only his fiancée— and they had no children. Upon reading this, <b>Stead</b> wondered if somehow the man had returned to the past to prevent an accident but lost his memory along the way. In addition, the article reminded <b>Stead</b> of a strange old man, called the 'laughing man', who lived near her house as a child.|$|E
5|$|Gallaher and {{his team}} faced them {{three days after the}} Yorkshire match. The All Blacks had thus far played 27 matches on tour, scoring 801 points while conceding only 22, and all in only 88 days. They were {{struggling}} to field fifteen fit players; a number of their best players, including <b>Stead,</b> were unavailable due to injury.|$|E
40|$|Christina <b>Stead's</b> works resist simplistic categorization, a {{circumstance}} which has attracted some critics and exasperated many others. The upsurge of post-colonial and feminist {{criticism in the}} 1980 s revitalized critical interest in her books. Exuberant intertextuality and an abundance of contradictory literary and ideological discourses - previously often regarded as excesses flawing <b>Stead's</b> literary style - now became appreciated qualities. The aim of this book is to illuminate a host of revealing, but frequently overlooked, details that form patterns essential for a deeper understanding and enjoyment of <b>Stead's</b> novels. Intertextuality and the workings of conflicting discourses play prominent parts in the critical analyses of quests undertaken by <b>Stead's</b> female characters, particularly that of Teresa Hawkins whose quest provides For Love Alone with its romance structure. A combination of Northrop Frye's myth criticism with feminist and post-colonial criticism opens the way for an in-depth analysis of Teresa as a modern quest hero, informed by literature but at odds with its conventional gender roles. The intertextual perspective sheds light on her progress, {{as well as on}} important parts of the literary context in which For Love Alone is embedded. The concluding survey of <b>Stead's</b> other novels traces the development of <b>Stead's</b> treatment of female quest within the entire body of her fiction...|$|R

5|$|The NZRFU named Gallaher captain for the tour, with Billy <b>Stead</b> as vice-captain. A week {{into the}} voyage to Britain aboard the SS Rumutaka, rumours {{circulated}} {{that some of}} the southern players were unhappy with the appointment of Gallaher, and with what they perceived as an Auckland bias in the squad. The dissidents contended that the captain and vice-captain should have been elected by the players, as they had been on the 1897 and 1903 tours to Australia. Gallaher recognised the damage factionalism might do to the team and offered to resign, as did the vice-captain <b>Stead.</b> Although the teams' manager refused to accept the resignations, the players still took a vote—17 out of 29 endorsed the NZRFU's selections.|$|E
