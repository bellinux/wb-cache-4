In {{the story of}} the Brazen Serpent, the people of Israel become dissatisfied and grumble at God. As punishment they receive a plague of venonous snakes. God offers the people relief by instructing Moses to make a snake of brass and <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> on a pole, the sight of which gives miraculous healing. Michelangelo chooses a crowded composition, depicting a dramatic mass of suffering men, women, and writhing snakes, separated from redeemed worshipers by the snake before an epiphanic light.|$|E

25|$|Streets of Fire {{began in}} the {{euphoria}} of knowing that Paramount really liked 48 {{and wanted to be}} in business with us if they could. What happened was that after we screened that cut for Paramount, Larry looked at Walter and said, “Paramount is pregnant; let’s get something and <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> right away.” Walter knew what he meant—that we were in a great position here—so he said, “We can do this two ways: present an idea now and get a deal done, or write a script on spec and get a lot more money.” Walter proudly considers himself a capitalist, so he suggested we do the latter.|$|E
25|$|The Wuppertal Suspension Railway had a forerunner: in 1824, Henry Robinson Palmer of England {{presented}} a railway system which differed from all previous constructions. It {{was a low}} single-rail suspension railway on which the carriages were drawn by horses. Friedrich Harkort, a Prussian industrial entrepreneur and politician, loved the idea. He saw big advantages for the transportation of coal to the early industrialised region {{in and around the}} Wupper valley. Harkort had his own steel mill in Elberfeld; he built a demonstration segment of the Palmer system and <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> in 1826 on the grounds of what is today the Wuppertal tax office. He tried to attract public attention to his railway plans.|$|E
25|$|After his consulship, Marcus Lucullus became {{governor}} (proconsul) of {{the important}} province of Macedonia. He used his tenure to lead a successful campaign against a neighboring tribe, the Thracian Bessi. In {{the course of this}} war, he advanced to the Danube and the west coast of the Black Sea where he conquered a number of Greek cities that had been bases of Mithridates VI The Great, including Apollonia, Kallatis (Callatis), Tomi, and Istros. For these achievements, he was awarded a triumph which he held in 71 BC. Part of the booty from this campaign was a colossal statue of Apollo that Marcus Lucullus took from a temple on an island near Apollonia.

The university is to accommodate 4000 students, primarily from the Middle East, North Africa and Europe. It is to have colleges for engineering, arts, sciences, education and health. The project has an investment of over €115 million, and it is to create around 400 to 750 jobs. The project is to generate an increase of €48 to €85 million in economic growth.|$|E
25|$|After {{the siege}} was lifted, the Spanish Regency {{presented}} {{one of the}} captured French mortars to Rear Admiral Arthur Kaye Legge. They requested {{that it might be}} placed in one of London's Royal Parks to commemorate the victory at Salamanca, the liberation of southern Spain and the exploits of the Duke of Wellington. The Prince Regent agreed and instructed the Earl of Mulgrave to procure a suitable carriage for the mortar and <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> in Horse Guards Parade. The royal carriage department at the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, carried out the work, creating an elaborate allegorically sculpted bronze base for the weapon. It was unveiled on the Prince Regent's 54th birthday, situated {{on the south side of}} the parade ground behind a square of chevaux de frise. It was subsequently moved to its present position adjacent to the Horse Guards building.|$|E

Later in the quarter, Alabama tied the game at 7–7 later in the quarter when Johnny Cain scored on a short touchdown run. The Crimson Tide then took a 9–7 lead {{early in the fourth}} quarter when both Tom Hupke and Jennings B. Whitworth blocked a Ralph Kercheval punt that rolled out of the endzone for a safety. Prior to the safety, a long Cain punt pinned Kentucky deep in its territory and <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against Kentucky to 10–1.|$|E

25|$|Anthony Crane {{appears to}} have been {{associated}} with religious reform as early as 1572, and after his death in 1583, Elizabeth Crane continued to assist Puritan writers and printers. According to the later testimony of her servant, Nicholas Tompkins, when the Puritan printer Robert Waldegrave's press and type were being destroyed by officers of the Stationers' Company in May 1588 {{as a result of his}} having printed John Udall's The State of the Church of England Laid Open, commonly referred to as Diotrephes' Dialogue, she allowed Waldegrave to bring a case of type, hidden under his cloak, to her London home in St Mary Aldermanbury. The Puritan preacher and pamphleteer John Penry secretly obtained a new press for Waldegrave, and in the late spring of 1588 she allowed Penry and Waldegrave to <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> at her country home at East Molesey, Surrey, across the Thames from Hampton Court Palace.

25|$|The {{founding}} {{figure of}} the field in Israel, Josef Tal, was first exposed to electronic music in the late 1920s in Germany. The founding of the Israel Center for Electronic Music {{was the result of}} a six-month UNESCO research fellowship on which Tal toured major international electronic music studios, in 1958. It was a meeting with Milton Babbitt at The Columbia-Princeton Electronic Music Center that pointed Josef Tal to the technology he needed to found the first electronic music studio in Israel. He learned from Vladimir Ussachevsky, about a new invention by Canadian inventor Hugh Le Caine, called the Multi-track. First built in 1955, this device could replay six independent magnetic tapes, with the speed and direction of each tape separately controllable. Le Caine's idea was to design an instrument to facilitate composition in the Parisian musique concrète tradition of Pierre Schaeffer. Following a successful fund-raising by Shalheveth Freier the Multi-track which was built for Tal's studio was completed and delivered to Jerusalem in 1961. It required a trip by Le Caine to <b>set</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> correctly.|$|E

The population of the village peaked in the mid-1880s before the general recession initiated a downturn for the village. Wason had expected for the Methven Branch railway to run past Barrhill, but the line was built in 1880 on an alignment many miles away, which caused Barrhill population to decrease.|$|E
