6000|$|It {{may seem}} to be a {{crowning}} feat of platitude to write that [...] "we have to remember" [...] this, but it is overlooked in a whole mass of legal, social and economic literature. Those extraordinary imaginary cases as between a man A and a man B who <b>start</b> <b>level,</b> on a desert island or elsewhere, and work or do not work, or save or do not save, become the basis of immense schemes of just arrangement which soar up confidently and serenely regardless of the fact that never did anything like that equal start occur; that from the beginning there were family groups and old heads and young heads, help, guidance and sacrifice, and those who had learnt and those who had still to learn, jumbled together in confused transactions. Deals, tradings and so forth are entirely secondary aspects of these primaries, and the attempt {{to get an idea of}} abstract relationship by beginning upon a secondary issue is the fatal pervading fallacy in all these regions of thought. At the present moment the average age of the world is I suppose about 21 or 22, the normal death somewhen about 44 or 45, that is to say nearly half the world is [...] "under age," [...] green, inexperienced, demanding help, easily misled and put in the wrong and betrayed. Yet the younger moiety, if we do indeed assume life's object is a collective synthesis, is more important than the older, and every older person bound to be something of a guardian to the younger. It follows directly from the fundamental beliefs I have assumed that we are missing the most important aspects of life if we are not directly or indirectly serving the young, helping them individually or collectively. Just in the measure that one's living falls away from that, do we fall away from life into a mere futility of existence, and approach the state, the extraordinary and wonderful middle state of (for example) those extinct and entirely damned old gentlemen one sees and hears eating and sleeping in every comfortable London club.|$|E

The study was carried out on eight boys, aged 15 − 17 years and it consisted of eight tests being part of the International Test of Physical Fitness and a 30 -second Wingate test on a foot-operated cycloergometer. A significant diversity of the examined golf players was observed during tests. Good and very poor results were achieved by individual subjects. The results show that the examined athletes have not undergone comprehensive training and that their motor level is conditioned by body build resulting from natural development. The obtained results are diversified in respect to the individual level of anaerobic function. The majority of results display a low level of adaptation to physical efforts of this type...|$|E

40|$|We {{identified}} {{risk factors}} associated with falling during steeplechase racing. We used retrospective data from all steeplechase runs on UK racecourses during 1999 : 10, 866 starts with 647 horse falls. The relationship between continuous variables and falling was assessed using generalised additive models (GAMs). Polynomial fits then were included in a multilevel, multivariable logistic-regression model. The number of runners had a linear, positive association with the risk of falling. The distance of the race had a non-linear relationship with the risk of falling; the risk steadily increased in races up to 23 furlongs (1 furlong approximately equals 198 m), and then decreased in longer races. Age also had a significant, non-linear relationship with the risk of falling: a decreasing risk up to 12 years of age followed by an increasing risk in older horses. Horses that wore visors and had raced previously were associated with {{a decrease in the}} risk of falling. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) showed that although most of the variation resided at the <b>start</b> (<b>level</b> 1), a proportion of variation in the risk of falling could be attributed to horse and race.

40|$|Accelerated life tests (ALTs) {{are often}} used to make timely {{assessments}} of the lifetime distribution of materials and components. The goal of many ALTs is estimation of a quantile of a log-location-scale failure time distribution. Much of the previous work on planning accelerated life tests has focused on deriving test-planning methods under a specific log-location-scale distribution. This paper presents a new approach for computing approximate large-sample variances of maximum likelihood estimators of a quantile of general a log-location-scale distribution with censoring and time-varying stress. The approach {{is based on a}} cumulative exposure model. Using sample data from a published paper describing optimum ramp-stress test plans, we show that our approach and the one used in the previous work give the same variance-covariance matrix of the quantile estimator from the two different approaches. Then, as an application of this approach, we extend the previous work to a new optimum ramp-stress test plan obtained by simultaneously adjusting the ramp rate and the lower <b>start</b> <b>level</b> of stress. We find that the new optimum test plan can have a smaller variance than that of the optimum ramp-stress test plan previously obtained by adjusting only the ramp rate. We compare optimum ramp-stress test plans with the more commonly used constant-stress accelerated life test plans. We also conduct simulations to provide insight and to check the adequacy of the large-sample approximate results obtained by the approach...|$|E
40|$|National audienceIt {{has been}} shown in the past that {{listeners}} judge differently the loudness change of sounds that increase or decrease in levels for the same physical variation. Different results were found concerning the direction of this asymmetry. It {{has been shown}} that loudness change measurement is strongly dependent on the procedure used: direct or indirect estimations. Direct estimation is mainly influenced by the global loudness of the sound (see co-submitted work). As a result, loudness change estimated by a direct procedure is greater for a ramped sound and remains whatever is the location in level. For indirect estimations, results are different and less obvious. In the present work, indirect estimations consisted in measuring the loudness {{at the end of the}} varying-level sounds using magnitude estimation for 1 -kHz tones, synthetic vowel sounds and white noises. The loudness change was defined as the ratio between the loudness estimated at the end of the varying sound and the loudness at its <b>start</b> <b>level.</b> The latter originated from the loudness function measured for stationary sounds. Indirect estimation of loudness change is greater for ramped than for damped sounds. Contrary to the result obtained with direct estimation, the difference between ramped and damped sounds decreased as the location in level of the variation increased; for variations in the more intense levels, the inverse effect was observed. In most conditions, the loudness at the end of the sounds (ramped or damped) was overestimated compared to the loudness of an equivalent steady state sound. As a result, the ratio (end loudness) /(start loudness) of ramped sounds was, most of time, greater than this ratio for damped sounds. These data showed that the estimation at the end of a sound increasing or decreasing in level explain the asymmetry obtained when measuring loudness changes of ramped and damped sounds indirectly...|$|E
