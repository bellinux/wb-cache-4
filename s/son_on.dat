5|$|Onassis's {{death had}} a {{profound}} effect on his father, who never fully recovered from the loss of his son. Aristotle Onassis sought to sell Olympic Airways after his son's death, and died two years later in March 1975. Onassis was buried alongside his <b>son</b> <b>on</b> Skorpios.|$|E

5|$|Eduard Anatolyevich Streltsov {{was born}} in Perovo, an eastern {{district}} of Moscow, on 21 July 1937, the son of Anatoly Streltsov, a front-line soldier and intelligence officer, and Sofia Frolovna. Anatoly {{did not return to}} the family following the Second World War, instead choosing to settle alone in Kiev; Sofia therefore raised her <b>son</b> <b>on</b> her own, working at the Fraser Cutting Instruments Factory to support Eduard and herself. As a result, Streltsov had a modest upbringing, the highlights of which were playing football and following his favoured team, Spartak Moscow.|$|E

5|$|Ewbank {{learned of}} the {{television}} problems {{in the locker room}} when he received a telephone call from his wife congratulating him on a Jets victory – Lucy Ewbank assumed the fact {{that the end of the}} game was not shown meant New York had won. Her husband profanely informed her of the game result. She was not the only Jets relative deceived – cornerback Johnny Sample flew back east after the game on personal business, and when his father picked him up at Philadelphia International Airport, he congratulated his <b>son</b> <b>on</b> a Jets triumph.|$|E
5|$|Grand Prince Géza died in 997. Stephen convoked an {{assembly}} at Esztergom where his supporters declared him grand prince. Initially, he only controlled the northwestern {{regions of the}} Carpathian Basin; {{the rest of the}} territory was still dominated by tribal chieftains. Stephen's ascension to the throne was in line with the principle of primogeniture, which prescribed that a father was succeeded by his <b>son.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, it contradicted the traditional idea of seniority, according to which Géza should have been succeeded by the most senior member of the Árpád dynasty, which was Koppány at that time. Koppány, who held the title Duke of Somogy, had for many years administered the regions of Transdanubia south of Lake Balaton.|$|E
5|$|Hancock {{rejoined the}} Continental Congress in Pennsylvania in June 1778, but his brief {{time there was}} unhappy. In his absence, Congress had elected Henry Laurens as its new president, which was a {{disappointment}} to Hancock, who had hoped to reclaim his chair. Hancock got along poorly with Samuel Adams, and missed his wife and newborn <b>son.</b> <b>On</b> July 9, 1778, Hancock and the other Massachusetts delegates joined the representatives from seven other states in signing the Articles of Confederation; the remaining states were not yet prepared to sign, and the Articles would not be ratified until 1781.|$|E

5|$|Jennings {{was born}} on July 29, 1938, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada; he and his younger sister Sarah {{were the only two}} {{children}} of Elizabeth (née Osborne) and Charles Jennings, a prominent radio broadcaster for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC). Peter Jennings started his broadcasting career at the age of nine, hosting Peter's People, a half-hour, Saturday morning, CBC Radio show for kids. His father was on a business trip to the Middle East when the show debuted; upon returning, Charles Jennings, who harbored a deep dislike of nepotism, was outraged to learn that the network had put his <b>son</b> <b>on</b> the air.|$|E
5|$|Martin Filler {{acknowledged}} that the film legitimately used artistic licence to make valid dramatic points, {{such as in the}} probably imagined scene when George V lectures his <b>son</b> <b>on</b> the importance of broadcasting. Filler cautions that George VI would never have tolerated Logue addressing him casually, nor swearing, and the King almost certainly would have understood a newsreel of Hitler speaking in German. Filler makes the larger point that both the King and his wife were, in reality, lukewarm towards Churchill because of the latter's support for his brother during the abdication crisis. They only warmed to Churchill later in the war, because of his performance as a wartime leader.|$|E
5|$|On December 12, 2011, these rumours {{were finally}} proven false, {{as it was}} {{announced}} through Kumi Koda's official site that she was engaged to Kenji03 from Back-On.

The two married on December 22, and Koda {{gave birth to the}} couple's first child, a <b>son,</b> <b>on</b> July 17, 2012.|$|E

Giorgio is stabbed by his wife while she {{attempts}} to let in her <b>son.</b> <b>On</b> opening the door, she is greeted by Gorca who bites her. Vladimir and Sdenka flee from their home and hide {{in the ruins of}} a cathedral. As Vladimir sleeps, Sdenka walks outside and finds Gorca and his family surrounding her. Vladimir awakens and searches for Sdenka, finding her lying motionless in her bed at home. Sdenka awakens and upon receiving Vladimir's embrace, she bites into his neck.|$|E
5|$|The novelist Vladimir Nabokov {{was the son}} of a {{professional}} lepidopterist, and was interested in butterflies himself. He wrote his novel Lolita while travelling on his annual butterfly-collection trips in the western United States. He eventually became a leading lepidopterist. This is reflected in his fiction, where for example The Gift devotes two whole chapters (of five) to the tale of a father and <b>son</b> <b>on</b> a butterfly expedition.|$|E
5|$|All Bismarck's {{resources}} were deployed; he even asked Empress Victoria {{to use her}} influence with her <b>son</b> <b>on</b> his behalf. But the wizard had lost his magic; his spells were powerless because they were exerted on {{people who did not}} respect them, and he who had so signally disregarded Kant's command to use people as ends in themselves had too small a stock of loyalty to draw on. As Lord Salisbury told Queen Victoria: 'The very qualities which Bismarck fostered in the Emperor in order to strengthen himself when the Emperor Frederick should come to the throne have been the qualities by which he has been overthrown.' The Empress, with what must have been a mixture of pity and triumph, told him that her influence with her son could not save him for he himself had destroyed it.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the police}} were sure murder had taken place, and {{that at least one}} of the four was guilty, they were {{uncertain}} whether they could secure a conviction. Police also suspected there had been other murders committed, but the lack of bodies hampered this line of enquiry. As news of the possibility of other murders came to the public's attention, newspapers began to publish lurid and inaccurate stories of the crimes; speculative reports led members of the public to assume that all missing people had been victims. Janet Brown went to the police and identified her friend Mary Paterson's clothing, while a local baker informed them that Jamie Wilson's trousers were being worn by Constantine Burke's <b>son.</b> <b>On</b> 19 November a warrant for the murder of Jamie Wilson was made against the four suspects.|$|E
5|$|As Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) {{attempts}} {{to negotiate with}} the Aldeans, they briefly allow Dr. Crusher to reunite with her <b>son</b> <b>on</b> the planet. Wesley hints about the Custodian to her, while she secretly passes him a tricorder to scan the Aldeans. After Picard fails to get the Aldeans to agree to the children's return, they fire an energy weapon that sends the Enterprise three days away from Aldea at maximum warp. The Aldeans warn that they can send the Enterprise an impossibly far distance if they refuse to cooperate. During the return trip, Dr. Crusher reviews the scanner results and finds the Aldeans are suffering from radiation poisoning, which has harmed their reproductive capabilities but can be reversed if the source is discovered. On arrival back at the planet, Picard orders the crew {{to try to find a}} way through the planet's shield while he restarts negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Bardanes is {{probably}} identical with the patrikios Bardanios who {{appears in the}} Chronicle of Theophanes the Confessor in the mid-790s. In 795, he was Domestic of the Schools (commander of the Scholai guards), and was dispatched to arrest the monk Plato of Sakkoudion for his public opposition to the second marriage of Emperor Constantine VI (r. 780–797) to Plato's niece Theodote. In 797, as strategos (military governor) of the Thracesian Theme, this same Bardanios supported the Empress-mother Irene of Athens when she usurped the throne from her <b>son.</b> <b>On</b> Easter Monday, 1 April 799, he is recorded {{as one of the}} four patrikioi (along with Niketas Triphyllios, Sisinnios Triphyllios and Constantine Boilas) who led the horses of the Empress's carriage on a unique triumphal procession from the palace to the Church of the Holy Apostles.|$|E
