500|$|Another general {{attitude}} and prejudice of Fleming's that Bond gives voice to includes {{his approach to}} homosexuality. While Fleming {{had a number of}} gay friends, including Noël Coward and his editor, William Plomer, he said that his books were [...] "written for warm-blooded heterosexuals". His attitude went further, with Bond opining that homosexuals were [...] "a herd of unhappy sexual misfits – barren and full of frustrations, the women wanting to dominate and the men to be nannied", adding that [...] "he was <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> but he had no time for them." ...|$|E
500|$|One of {{the themes}} that dominates {{the latter part of}} Blair's time in office is his {{decision}} to join US President George W. Bush in committing troops to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the aftermath of which he describes as a [...] "nightmare", but that he believes to have been necessary because Saddam Hussein [...] "had not abandoned the strategy of WMD , merely made a tactical decision to put it into abeyance". He would make the same decision again with regard to Iran, warning that if that country develops nuclear weapons it will change the balance of power of the Middle East, to the region's detriment. Blair believes some problems in Iraq still require a [...] "resolution" [...] and will fester if left unattended. Of the war dead he says, [...] "I feel desperately <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>them,</b> sorry for the lives cut short, sorry for the families whose bereavement is made worse by the controversy over why their loved ones died, sorry for the utterly unfair selection that the loss should be theirs." [...] A year on from the invasion he hopes Bush will win a second term as US President: [...] "I had come to like and admire George," [...] he writes.|$|E

500|$|Confronted by a Puritan {{friend with}} rumours about his [...] "ungodly life", Dudley defended himself in 1576: I {{stand on the}} top of the hill, where ... the {{smallest}} slip seemeth a fall ... I may fall many ways and have more witnesses thereof than many others who perhaps be no saints neither ... for my faults ... they lie before Him who I have no doubt but will cancel them as I have been and shall be most heartily <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> With Douglas Sheffield, a young widow of the Howard family, he had a serious relationship from about 1569. He explained to her that he could not marry, not even in order to beget a Dudley heir, without his [...] "utter overthrow": You must think it is some marvellous cause ... that forceth me thus to be cause almost of the ruin of mine own house ... my brother you see long married and not like to have children, it resteth so now in myself; and yet such occasions is there ... as if I should marry I am sure never to have [...] favour". Although in this letter Leicester said he still loved her as he did at the beginning, he offered her his help to find another husband for reasons of respectability if she so wished. The affair continued and in 1574 [...] Douglas gave birth to a son, also called Robert Dudley.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 December 2012, HSBC {{agreed to}} pay a record $1.92 billion fine in this money {{laundering}} case. [...] "Bank officials repeatedly ignored internal warnings that HSBC's monitoring systems were inadequate, the Justice Department said. In 2008, for example, the CEO of HSBC Mexico was told that Mexican law enforcement had a recording of a Mexican drug lord saying that HSBC Mexico {{was the place to}} launder money." [...] The DOJ, however, decided not to pursue criminal penalties, a decision which the New York Times labelled a [...] "dark day for the rule of law."

2500|$|At Columbia University in 1971, Borges further {{elaborated}} on the story's creation, [...] "I {{tried to}} imagine what a real Nazi might be like. I mean someone who thought of violence as being praiseworthy for its own sake. Then I thought that this archetype of the Nazis wouldn't mind being defeated; after all, defeats and victories are mere matters of chance. He would still be glad of the fact, even if the Americans and British won the war. Naturally, when I am with Nazis, I find they are not my idea of what a Nazi is, but this wasn't meant to be a political tract. It was meant to stand for {{the fact that there was}} something tragic in the fate of a real Nazi. Except that I wonder if a real Nazi ever existed. At least, when I went to Germany, I never met one.

60|$|Joan went to {{the seat}} by the tree, near the camp-fire. A purple {{twilight}} was shadowing the canon. Far above, on the bold peak the last warmth of the afterglow was fading. There was no wind, no sound, no movement. Joan wondered where Jim Cleve was then. They had often sat in the twilight. She felt an unreasonable resentment toward him, knowing she was to blame, but blaming him for her plight. Then suddenly {{she thought of her}} uncle, of home, of her kindly old aunt who always worried so about her. Indeed, there was cause to worry. She felt <b>sorrier</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> than <b>for</b> herself. And that broke her spirit momentarily. Forlorn, and with a wave of sudden sorrow and dread and hopelessness, she dropped her head upon her knees and covered her face. Tears were a relief. She forgot Kells and the part she must play. But she remembered swiftly--at the rude touch of his hand.|$|R

2500|$|Discipline {{within the}} 33rd Alabama was lenient, {{compared}} to this: most minor offenses were dealt with initially by a warning; if the conduct persisted, the offender might be given extra [...] "police duty," [...] which would entail sweeping, cleaning his living area, digging or cleaning out latrine or offal pits or similar activities during off-duty hours. The worst punishment usually meted out {{for all but}} the most serious of offenses was to be confined to the guard quarters while performing extra duty; however, Matthews indicates that those so confined were often helped in doing their punishment work by comrades who felt <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>them.</b> The worst punishments inflicted on anyone in the 33rd were [...] "bucking and gagging," [...] the wearing of a [...] "barrel shirt," [...] or carrying a rail while marchingaccording to him, this was done to just one man, and that by the army's provost marshal, not any regimental authority.|$|E
2500|$|Witness George Lopez, once {{friends with}} the accuser's family, gave the family money, but had a falling out when the father kept asking for more. [...] Lopez also {{described}} an incident when the Arvizos allegedly tried to frame him for stealing $300 from Gavin's wallet. This allegation was used to illustrate a pattern of family behavior. [...] However, the accuser's sister, Davellin, testified that these problems were all caused by her father before the divorce. Other popular comedians testified about their run-ins with the Arvizos. Chris Tucker claimed he had felt <b>sorry</b> <b>for</b> <b>them</b> and had taken them out, bought them things, and given them money; but he felt the Arvizos expected too much, calling him their [...] "brother" [...] and taking advantage of him. He testified that he had warned Michael Jackson about the family, whom he called [...] "cunning." [...] Jay Leno testified that Gavin Arvizo, with a woman directing him in the background, called him and praised him lavishly.
