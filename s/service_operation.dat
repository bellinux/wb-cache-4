25|$|Operations {{management}} {{is an area}} of management concerned with designing and controlling the process of production and redesigning business operations in the production of goods or services. It involves the responsibility of ensuring that business operations are efficient in terms of using as few resources as needed and effective in terms of meeting customer requirements. It is concerned with managing an entire production system which is the process that converts inputs (in the forms of raw materials, labor, and energy) into outputs (in the form of goods and/or services), as an asset or delivers a product or services. Operations produce products, manage quality and creates <b>service.</b> <b>Operation</b> management covers sectors like banking systems, hospitals, companies, working with suppliers, customers, and using technology. Operations {{is one of the major}} functions in an organization along with supply chains, marketing, finance and human resources.

It recorded more than a million miles of passenger <b>service</b> <b>operation</b> during 28 years of Southern main line use. It was purchased from British Railways for Lord Montagu's National Motor Museum on withdrawal in 1962. It was moved to the East Somerset Railway in 1973, and then to the Bluebell Railway where it was put into running order by the Maunsell Locomotive Society, entering service in 1981. It ran for the length of its ten-year boiler ticket and was withdrawn from service in 1991. 'Stowe' was purchased by the MLS from Lord Montagu in September 2000, thus securing its future at the Bluebell. The purchase was funded in part by the sale of S15 class no. 830, which subsequently moved to the North Yorkshire Moors Railway where it awaits restoration to working order. In 2003 the tender was completely rebuilt, with a brand new tank being built. 'Stowe' is now undergoing a full overhaul to working order, with funds being raised through the Bluebell's 'Keep Up The Pressure' campaign.|$|E

40|$|<b>Service</b> <b>operations</b> are {{currently}} at {{the hub of}} economic activities {{in some parts of}} the world. Although indicators seem to suggest the existence and future dominance of service economies, such economies will only be sustainable if appropriate use of scientific and engineering methods are applied to the complete spectrum of service operations; i. e. the engineering aspects and the business side (management) of operating systems. The challenge, therefore, lies in selecting appropriate scientific and engineering tools, techniques, methods and technologies for implementation in those critical areas that can leverage dynamics in <b>service</b> <b>operations</b> as they are known today. Of all engineering disciplines currently available today, industrial engineering and its related equivalence or variants is among the most multifaceted disciplines that can face up to the challenge of advancing <b>service</b> <b>operations</b> to higher dimensions. Such advancement requires appropriate demonstrable, practical and transferable research results as well as suitable case studies on <b>service</b> <b>operations.</b> In light of the quest to advance <b>service</b> <b>operations,</b> this paper discusses the changing roles of industrial engineering and its crucial input in advancing <b>service</b> <b>operations</b> towards growth, development and perhaps global dominance of service economies...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Technology {{evolution}} compels retail {{network to}} come out with unique business models to retain customers and to win competitive advantage. Customer reviews available through social media need {{to be taken into account}} by retail networks to design a model with unique <b>service</b> <b>operations</b> and marketing approaches that will improve loyalty by value addition to the customers. Hence our study attempts to understand how retail network leverages the potential of social media review along with its unique <b>service</b> <b>operations</b> to satisfy customers. Additionally we plan to study the impact of marketing function’s brand and promotional offers interaction with social media review and <b>service</b> <b>operations</b> to satisfy customers. Design/methodology/approach: We develop a conceptual model for this era of social media. We combine the idea of loyalty based and value based models of Chatterjee (2013). We use a survey questionnaire method to get opinions of retail customers satisfaction based on social media review, <b>service</b> <b>operations</b> and marketing efforts. We derive measures of our model from existing literature and expert opinions. Findings: Social media review is having a strong impact on customer satisfaction. Similarly our empirical analysis identifies the significant positive role of <b>service</b> <b>operations</b> in customer satisfaction. Interestingly we didn’t find enough support for brand satisfaction on customer satisfaction. However, when promotion interacts well with <b>service</b> <b>operations,</b> the customer satisfaction is significantly affected. Similarly we didn’t see positive outcome when there is an interaction between promotion and social media review. After reading the reviews, some potential buyers make a visit to store before making final decisions and surprisingly promotional effects are not changing their mind set. Practical implications: Research findings insist the importance of social media review, marketing and interaction between promotion and <b>service</b> <b>operations</b> would help retail network to build loyalty and value based models. This sends a strong message to retail network that promotions combined with <b>service</b> <b>operations,</b> good planning and reasonable pricing can help retail network to sustain in the competitive business market. Originality/value: We combine social media review, promotions with <b>service</b> <b>operations</b> of the retailers to improve customer satisfaction. The idea of combining social media review, marketing and operations will help businesses to survive competition in the social media era...|$|R
