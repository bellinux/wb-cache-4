40|$|Unexpected {{failure of}} subaqueous {{excavated}} slopes {{in the form}} of flow slides is considered in this graduate study. Excavated slopes {{are not the same as}} slopes constructed by means of hydraulic fill. Several recent flow slide failures in <b>sand</b> <b>borrow</b> <b>pits,</b> together with qualms in engineering practice about not knowing exactly what fundamental mechanism causes flow slide failure, gave cause for this study. The knowledge that flow slide failure may be caused by either static liquefaction of (part of) a sloping body (also called spontaneous collapse), or by the development of active banks, is taken as a point of departure. Liquefaction due to dynamic loading will be left out of consideration. Special attention will be paid to the geological circumstances of The Netherlands. Herewith, the central problem of this flow slide study becomes: "How, from an engineering point of view, can we understand and predict flow slide failure of excavated (or being excavated) slopes, better?". To be able to answer the question at issue, we need to understand the fundamental mechanisms, leading to flow slide failure. Then, the soil properties may be related to the mechanisms and specific circumstances may be taken into account. The main aim of this graduate study is to obtain insight in different mechanisms, possibly triggering flow slide failure and causing its retrogressive nature. Since the extent of a flow slide can be very large, and seems hard to predict, the prediction of the potential for failure will be the pith of the study, not the consequences of failure (Volume 1 : Literature Review). The possible ways to model failure potential are investigated and their prediction values are evaluated on the basis of case histories (Volume 3 : Case History Study / Appendix). With the insights obtained, an effort has been made to formulate a practical guideline for flow slide analyses, which should lead to improvements in engineering practice (this Volume 2 : Directive for Engineering Practice).

40|$|M. Sc. This study {{focuses on}} the {{rehabilitation}} of <b>borrow</b> <b>pits</b> on linear pipeline projects. In the past {{there have been many}} attempts to rehabilitate <b>borrow</b> <b>pits</b> to an ecological acceptable manner. Recently legislation has become more stringent regarding mine closure and rehabilitation. With the introduction of the new Mineral and Petroleum Development Act (MPRDA 28 of 2002), there has been an increase of awareness towards the immediate environment. As this project was a challenge in itself, there were no clear and concise methods in the Act that provide guidelines for final rehabilitation. Normally <b>borrow</b> <b>pits</b> as used on road concessions for material sourcing is left as different landforms like before excavation. The main {{reason for this is that}} materials are removed from the pits and not replaced, resulting in areas that are usually lower than their original ground levels. Some unwanted screened material will return to these <b>borrow</b> <b>pits</b> but will not complement what the original level should be. These <b>borrow</b> <b>pits</b> are usually clearly visible as low lying areas filled with water alongside roads. The Vaal River Eastern Subsection Augmentation Project (VRESAP) pipeline <b>borrow</b> <b>pits</b> were unique in the sense that not only material from screening activities were replaced, but also material excavated from the trench were replaced into the <b>borrow</b> <b>pits.</b> What makes this study unique is the fact that an opportunity was presented and clearly stipulated by the standard environmental management plan (SEMP) that <b>borrow</b> <b>pits</b> had to be filled back to their original ground levels or an acceptable level agreed on by the landowner. With this unique project, unique problems arose causing excess material amounting to 327 700 m³, available from the pipeline cavity. External spoil areas had to be promulgated and managed as part of site. This study through its various elements addresses some of the main problems encountered on VRESAP by looking at soil analysis, monitoring regimes, pre and post land use and other mechanisms from literature studies used on similar projects in the mining industry. vii The study also provides recommendations to the reader for future pipeline developments as well as conclusions made by the author. The recommendations made, include ways of rehabilitation planning through trials and errors made on site.

However, one problem of dredged materials is that they can be weak ground materials. Therefore, slag-mixed material made from the dredged material and steelmaking slag has been proposed. In this study, control of hydrogen sulfide release resulting from changing the hardness of the slag-mixed materials has been examined. Hydrogen sulfide release strongly depends on the hardness of the slag-mixed material. Microbial analysis indicated fewer living bacteria and the relative abundance of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the slag-mixed material compared with the dredged material. The solidification of the dredged material using steelmaking slag decreased not only hydrogen sulfide release but also dissolved iron and manganese release. It is considered that controlling the hardness of the dredged material mixed with steelmaking slag provides an effective means of sulfide release control...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Steep {{bathymetric}} anomalies in {{the beach}} profile, such as offshore <b>borrow</b> <b>pits,</b> submerged breakwaters, and nearshore canyons can significantly transform the wave climate through {{the effects of}} refraction, diffraction, and reflection. When located in the nearshore region the modified wave climate can also substantially change the location of breaking and has been observed to impact the shoreline morphology. The current study focuses on the <b>borrow</b> <b>pit</b> case and attempts to explain how limitations in existing methodologies may impact the predictions in both the wave field modification and shoreline response. Recent analytical methods by Bender (2003) have successfully explained the wave transformation near pits. However, these models are only capable of modeling bathymetries of constant depth surrounding the anomaly. Therefore in order to investigate cases without this restriction, this often requires numerical solutions following Berkhoff's (1972) mild-slope equation (MSE). However, a significant limitation of these model types is the accuracy suffers for steep bathymetric features. Booij (1983) demonstrates this for slopes larger than 1 : 3 (rise:run). Furthermore, these models often rely on Radder's (1979) parabolic approximation to the MSE which restricts the ability to include wave reflection which can be substantial {{in the case of}} a <b>borrow</b> <b>pit.</b> These limitations and their effects on shoreline response are investigated in the current study. By utilizing a form of the modified mild-slope equation (MMSE) originally derived by Massel (1993) the limitation of the MSE in representing steep features is removed. Additionally, a numerical model following Lee et al. (1998) is employed to investigate wave transformation around <b>borrow</b> <b>pits</b> of arbitrary depth. The formulation of the model is of hyperbolic form; therefore, the reflected waves generated by a <b>borrow</b> <b>pit</b> are included. The models accuracy is validated through a rigorous set of tests showing that the model compares well with previous analytical solutions for steep features.

First, the model is tested for numerical limitations on the higher order bottom slope and curvature terms using a idealized cases of a simple depth transition and a symmetric trapezoidal trench, with comparisons of the MMSE to both the traditional Mild Slope Equation (MSE) solution and a shallow water analytic solution. It is demonstrated that the model gives accurate solutions on slopes as steep as 1 : 1, and that the solutions from all three models agree in the shallow water region. However, for waves in intermediate depths, predicted wave reflection from nearshore depressions is shown to differ significantly between the MMSE and MSE models. Next, geometrical data {{from a wide range}} of existing and proposed <b>borrow</b> <b>pits</b> and a submarine canyon are gathered and analyzed for whether wave reflection is an important process near realistic nearshore depressions. The geometric data show that realistic nearshore depressions lie within the tested range of the MMSE model and that <b>borrow</b> <b>pits</b> are generally not in shallow water, which means it is important to use an MMSE-type model to calculate reflection from these features.
