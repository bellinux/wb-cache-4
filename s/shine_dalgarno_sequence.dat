50|$|The {{elements}} of a eukaryotic and prokaryotic 5′ UTR differ greatly. The prokaryotic 5′ UTR contains a ribosome binding site (RBS), {{also known as the}} <b>Shine</b> <b>Dalgarno</b> <b>sequence</b> (AGGAGGU), which is usually 3-10 base pairs upstream from the initiation codon. In contrast, the eukaryotic 5′ UTR contains the Kozak consensus sequence (ACCAUGG), which contains the initiation codon. The eukaryotic 5′ UTR also contains cis-acting regulatory elements called upstream open reading frames (uORFs) and upstream AUGs and termination codons (uAUGs), which have a great impact on the regulation of translation (see below). Unlike prokaryotes, 5′ UTRs can harbor introns in eukaryotes. In humans, ~35% of all genes harbor introns within the 5′ UTR.|$|E

Our results indicated that all three tools called the same stop codon but different start codons for 1293 ORFs. In addition, Rast found fewer genes but had longer average gene length compared to JGI and Manatee suggesting that Rast’s annotation tool might have a higher cut-off value for gene size.

We have also joined the fragment to a synthetic IFN-alpha 1 gene, using synthetic oligonucleotides to generate a completely natural, highly efficient bacterial translation initiation signal on the promoter proximal side of the IFN gene.

By partial digestion {{of the in}} vitro transcripts with S 1, T 1, and cobra venom nucleases as probes of mRNA conformation, single- and double-stranded regions, respectively, were also identified. Thus, a prominent inverted complementary repeat sequence was demonstrated spanning the + 14 to + 50 positions, which contain the complementary sequences CCUCC and GGAGG (the <b>Shine</b> and <b>Dalgarno</b> <b>sequence</b> for synthesis of CAT) symmetrically apposed and paired {{as part of a}} perfect 12 -base-pair inverted complementary repeat sequence (- 19. 5 kcal [ca. - 81. 7 kJ] per mol). The CAT mRNA was stable to digestion by T 1 RNase at the four guanosine residues in the <b>Shine</b> and <b>Dalgarno</b> <b>sequence</b> GGAGG, even at 60 degrees C, suggesting that nascent CAT mRNA allows ribosomes to initiate protein synthesis inefficiently and that induction involves post-transcriptional unmasking of the <b>Shine</b> and <b>Dalgarno</b> <b>sequence.</b> Consistent with this model of regulation, we found that cells carrying pC 194, induced with chloramphenicol, contain about the same concentration of pulse-labeled CAT-specific RNA as do uninduced cells. Induction of CAT synthesis by the non- acetylatable chloramphenicol analog fluorothiamphenicol was tested by using minicells of Bacillus subtilis carrying pC 194 as well as minicells containing the cloned pC 194 derivatives in which parts of the CAT structural gene were deleted in vitro with BAL 31 exonuclease. Optimal induction of both full-length (active) and deleted (inactive) CAT required similar concentrations of fluorothiamphenicol, whereas induction by chloramphenicol required a higher concentration for the wild-type full-length (active) CAT than for the (inactive) deleted CAT. Because synthesis of deleted CAT was inducible, we infer that CAT plays no direct role in regulating its own synthesis...|$|R

Few reasons for such ambiguity include the impact of partial sequences in databases due to the difficulty in covering both ends of the gene with universal primers commonly used for determining 16 S rRNA gene sequences. Such sequences compete with complete rRNA sequences in sequence similarity searches.

40|$|Bibliography: pages 117 - 130. Protection {{of plants}} from {{pathogens}} and pests by introduced microorganisms provides {{an alternative to}} environmentally hazardous chemical pesticides and fungicides. Plant associated, free living, non-pathogenic bacteria found in the rhizosphere and phyllo plane have been the emphasis of research on biological control· agents. These regions however pose problems of competition between introduced microorganisms and native microflora and environmental extremes. Endophytic bacteria, present in the interior regions of healthy plants, offer a solution to these problems. Since little {{work has been done}} to date with endophytes, the work reported in this thesis comprises a novel approach to achieving biological control of a plant pest and pathogens. An endophytic strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens was isolated from micro propagated apple plantlets and shown to be present in the roots of beans at a level of 1. 2 x 10 ⁵ CFU/g fresh weight 10 days after introduction. Generation of spontaneous rifampicin resistant mutants of this strain resulted in P. fluorescens Rifl. Isolates of P. fluorescens and Aeromonas caviae were recovered from the interior regions of surface sterilized bean seeds. In addition, two sugarcane endophytes, Acetobacter diazotrophicus and Herbaspirillum seropedicae, which has also been isolated from rice, maize and sorghum, as well as an endophytic Citrobacter sp. of pine seeds and bean plants were used in this work. The gene coding for the major chitinase of S. marcescens, chiA, was cloned {{under the control of the}} tac promoter by PCR amplification. The gene contained the endogenous <b>Shine</b> <b>Dalgarno</b> <b>sequence</b> 7 bases upstream of the ATG start codon in the plasmid pTC 33. The plasmid ptacchiA had previously been constructed with a distance of 20 bases between the ribosome binding site of this vector and the A TG start codon of the gene. Gene expression of chiA carried on pTC 33 was shown to be approximately 16 -foldhigher than that of ptacchiA. This clearly illustrated that the distance between the <b>Shine</b> <b>Dalgarno</b> <b>sequence</b> and ATG start codon was critical and that the shorter distance of 7 bases significantly increased the translation efficiency of chiA. The first and second generation tacchiA cassettes from ptacchiA and pTC 33 respectively were cloned into the broad host range plasmids pKT 240, pDER 405 and pML 122 and into the integration vector pJfF 350. These plasmids were introduced into the endophytes P. fluorescens Rift, H. seropedicae and Citrobacter sp. AJl by conjugative transfer and electroporation and were shown to express the gene at varying levels. pKTCl and pMTC 33 carrying the 1 and 2 nd generation tacchiA cassettes on pKT 240 and pML 122 respectively were not stably maintained in P. fluorescens Rift or H. seropedicae...|$|E

40|$|Elongation factor P (EF-P) is {{required}} for the efficient synthesis of proteins with stretches of consecutive prolines and other motifs that would otherwise lead to ribosome pausing. However, previous reports also demonstrated that levels of most diprolyl-containing proteins are not altered by the deletion of efp. To define the particular sequences that trigger ribosome stalling at diprolyl (PPX) motifs, we used ribosome profiling to monitor global ribosome occupancy in Escherichia coli strains lacking EF-P. Only 2. 8 % of PPX motifs caused significant ribosomal pausing in the Δefp strain, with up to a 45 -fold increase in ribosome density observed at the pausing site. The unexpectedly low fraction of PPX motifs that produce a pause in translation led us to investigate the possible role of sequences upstream of PPX. Our data indicate that EF-P dependent pauses are strongly affected by sequences upstream of the PPX pattern. We found that residues as far as 3 codons upstream of the ribosomal peptidyl-tRNA site had a dramatic effect on whether or not a particular PPX motif triggered a ribosomal pause, while internal <b>Shine</b> <b>Dalgarno</b> <b>sequences</b> upstream of the motif had no effect on EF-P dependent translation efficiency. Increased ribosome occupancy at particular stall sites did not reliably correlate with a decrease in total protein levels, suggesting that in many cases other factors compensate for the potentially deleterious effects of stalling on protein synthesis. These findings indicate that the ability of a given PPX motif to initiate an EF-P-alleviated stall is strongly influenced by its local context, and that other indirect post-transcriptional effects determine the influence of such stalls on protein levels within the cell...|$|R

Determination of the transcription start point by reverse transcriptase mapping localised the two base changes with respect to the elements that control malT expression. One of the base changes (malTp 1) is located in the Pribnow box of the promoter, and presumably results in an increase in the rate of transcription initiation. The other (malTp 7) is located in the <b>Shine</b> and <b>Dalgarno</b> <b>sequence,</b> which precedes the malT cistron. It probably created a more favourable ribosome binding site on malT mRNA. A correlate of these observations is that the promoter and the ribosome binding site are both inefficient in a wild-type malT gene.

40|$|Overexpression of the Sulfolobus solfataricus L 12 ribosomal protein gene in E. coli cells yielded two {{products}} of different size. If the E. coli cells carrying the overexpression plasmid were induced {{in the early}} stage of bacterial growth, the smaller of the two products was almost exclusively produced. However, induction in a late stage of bacterial growth yielded the larger product in significant excess. The larger protein was identified as the translation product of the entire SsoL 12 gene, while the smaller product was a N-terminally shortened version of the L 12 protein (sh-SsoL 12), starting with a N-terminal methionine at position 22 of the coded protein and continuing with the predicted protein sequence. Position 22 is an isoleucine in the complete SsoL 12 protein sequence, coded by an AUA codon. A subclone (SsoL 12 **) of the SsoL 12 gene containing overexpression plasmid, lacking the regular AUG start codon and the putative <b>Shine</b> <b>Dalgarno</b> <b>sequence,</b> was constructed to determine if E. coli ribosomes could initiate at this AUA codon. During overexpression the SsoL 12 ** construct yielded exclusively the sh-SsoL 12 product in significant amounts. An AUA start codon has never been found before in a natural message.

40|$|Heterogeneous folding and {{function}} are observed commonly for RNA, DNA, and protein, yet remain poorly understood. For RNA, several molecular origins have been proposed, including UV cross-linking, slow sugar repuckering, and alternate folding associated with denaturation during most purification methods. Additionally, natural alternative folds for many RNAs serve {{to control the}} biological function of the RNA. With each of these cases, there results variations in RNA fold that effect local and global behaviors of the RNA of interest. The hairpin ribozyme is a well-studied example of a highly structured functional RNA that exhibits pronounced heterogeneity. We have assessed the relative contributions of UV cross-linking, sugar repuckering and alternative folding to molecular heterogeneity of the hairpin ribozyme and find that it is multifactorial and can be systematically suppressed. Exposure to short-wavelength UV irradiation introduces distributive cross-links between adjacent pyrimidines and is avoided by using longer-wavelength irradiation or staining with crystal violet for visualization. Differential selective 2 ′-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE) does not reveal strong evidence for slow sugar repuckering. The remaining folding heterogeneity is removed using a non-denaturing affinity purification method that maintains the co-transcriptional fold of the RNA. These results suggest that heterogeneous folding and thus function of RNA generally may have multiple origins and are minimized by the avoidance of short-range UV exposure and the segmental, 5 ’-to- 3 ’-directed folding resulting from transcription. Moving to studying natural heterogeneities necessary for biological function, we establish a ribosome expression system capable of site-specific fluorescence labeling and translation. We show that these ribosomes are capable of translating gene products in vitro, as well as forming initiation complexes. These assays {{form the basis for}} single molecule studies of (pre) initiation complex formation on the Thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis (Tte) 1564 / 1563 mRNA. The coding sequence of this mRNA is preceded by the Tte preQ 1 translational riboswitch. Acting in response to binding the small metabolite preQ 1, the <b>Shine</b> <b>Dalgarno</b> <b>sequence</b> of the mRNA is sequestered into the aptamer domain.

40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) is {{a leading}} cause of death from a single {{infectious}} agent and infects one third of the world’s population in a latent form. Latent TB is characterised by presence of TB antigens but a lack of symptoms of TB. Latent TB is associated with the persistent form of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and is a reservoir from which symptomatic infection arises. Non-replicating persistence (NRP) is postulated to be a reversible state characterised by lack of replication, decreased metabolic activity and increased antimicrobial resistance. To achieve viable persistence, NRP cells have been postulated to require stabilisation of cellular structures needed for stress tolerance and for the transition from NRP to active replication. This study investigates the hypothesis that ribosome stabilisation assists in mycobacterial stress tolerance and persistence. RafS is a novel mycobacterial ribosome associated factor and putative ribosome stabilisation factor. The physiological roles and functional characteristics of RafS are investigated in this study. The role of RafS in M. smegmatis (Msm) and M. tuberculosis (Mtb) physiology were investigated. Competitive survival assays between wild type and ΔrafSMtb illustrated that RafSMtb confers a competitive advantage during survival under nutrient limitation. RafSMsm and RafHMtb were found to significantly inhibit in vitro translation. Furthermore, RafSMsm and RafHMtb inhibited in vitro translation of mRNA with and without <b>Shine</b> <b>Dalgarno</b> <b>sequences.</b> It was determined that RafSMsm is dispensable for growth and survival in several conditions and also for mature biofilm and pellicle formation. Also, RafSMsm is dispensable for tolerance of heat, acid and antibiotic stress. Ribosomal profiling indicated no significant effect of rafSMsm deletion on ribosomal subunit association in log phase and stationary phase rich media cultures. These findings are discussed in the context of mycobacterial growth, survival, stress tolerance and persistence mechanisms. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{interrelation}} between ribosomal protein S 1 and IF 3 in recognition/discrimination of 5 ′-terminal start codons by 30 S ribosomes {{has been}} studied using in vitro toeprinting. The study has been performed with two naturally occurring leaderless mRNAs, λ cI and phage r 1 t rro mRNA, {{as well as with}} an artificial leaderless mRNA derived from the E. coli ompA gene. We show that in the absence of S 1, IF 3 does not discriminate against the authentic 5 ′-terminal start codon of both cI and rro mRNA. Since IF 3 was able to exert its proofreading function for initiator tRNAMetf on 30 S ribosomes lacking S 1, this observation cannot be attributed to a lack of binding to or action of IF 3 on 30 S(−S 1) ribosomes. In contrast to leaderless mRNAs, ternary complex formation occurs in the presence of IF 3 with 30 S ribosomes when the start codon is preceded by a short 20 -nucleotide 5 ′-untranslated region containing a canonical <b>Shine</b> and <b>Dalgarno</b> <b>sequence.</b> This suggests that 5 ′-terminal start codons are recognised by IF 3 as non-standard {{because of the lack of}} 16 S rRNA-mRNA contacts...|$|R

However, little is known in terms of structural requirements, kinetics of interaction with their targets and regulatory mechanisms of the anti-toxin RNAs. Here, we present a combined in vitro and in vivo analysis of the bsrG/SR 4 type I toxin– antitoxin system from Bacillus subtilis. The second-ary structures of SR 4 and bsrG mRNA and of the SR 4 /bsrG RNA complex were determined, apparent binding rate constants calculated and functional segments required for complex formation narrowed down. The initial contact between SR 4 and its target was shown to involve the SR 4 terminator loop and loop 3 of bsrG mRNA. Additionally, a con-tribution of the stem of SR 4 stem-loop 3 to target binding was found. On SR 4 /bsrG complex formation, a 4 bp double-stranded region sequestering the bsrG <b>Shine</b> <b>Dalgarno</b> (SD) <b>sequence</b> was extended to 8 bp.

To test whether the db-anti-db interaction is required for translation initiation, we have used three different leaderless transcripts, the lambda(cI), phage P 2 gene V and Tn 1721 tetR mRNA. Using primer extension inhibition analysis (toeprinting), we show that the db does not influence translation initiation complex formation in vitro. In an attempt to demonstrate the simultaneous interactions between the db and anti-db and between the anticodon of initiator tRNA and the start codon, respectively, chemical probing has been employed on cI translation initiation complexes. These studies did not reveal a protection of the bases comprising the putative db in cI.

The effi-ciency of formation of this ternary complex is modulated by intrinsic features of the 50 -untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA, including the <b>Shine</b> and <b>Dalgarno</b> (SD) <b>sequence</b> and a region rich in pyrimidines, which is recognized by ribosomal protein (r-protein) S 1 (reviewed in Laursen et al., 2005). In contrast, leaderless mRNAs (lmRNAs), which are present in Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya, start directly with the AUG-initiation codon, and thus lack these recognition motifs. As there is no evidence for ribosome recruitment signals in the 50 -coding region of lmRNAs (reviewed in Moll et al., 2002 b), the 50 terminus, binding site on top of helix 44 (h 44), spanning the region between h 24 and h 28 of 16 S rRNA, which contacts the conserved nucle-otides A 794 and G 926. This position coincides with the mRNA track at the P- and E-site codon. Binding experiments indicated that Ksg indirectly induces dissociation of P-site-bound fMet-tRNAMetf from 30 S subunits through perturbation of the mRNA, thereby interfering with translation initiation (Schluenzen et al., 2006; Schuwirth et al., 2006).

40|$|The uibiquitous Type II toxin – {{antitoxin}} (TA) loci encode two proteins, a toxin and an antitoxin. The antitoxin combines {{with and}} neutralizes a cognate toxin. Usually, the TA genes form an operon that is transcribed {{by a single}} promoter located upstream of the genes. In most cases, the antitoxin autoregulates the TA operon via binding to operator sites in the promoter region. In almost all such cases, the toxin act as a co-repressor of transcription as the toxin enhances the DNA binding of the antitoxin. Recently, {{it has been shown}} that toxins play an additional role in stimulating transcription, as the antitoxin and toxin ratio is important for cooperative binding of the complex to DNA. The antitoxin is rapidly degraded by cellular proteases under conditions of stress and treatment with antibiotics, which leads to activation of the toxin. The toxins of TAs belong to different gene families. The most abundant TA gene family is vapBC that, in some organisms, have expanded into cohorts of genes. For example, the major human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis contains at least 88 TAs, 45 of which are vapBC loci. VapC toxins encoded by vapBC loci are PIN domain proteins (PilT N-terminal). Eukaryotic PIN domain proteins are site-specific ribonucleases involved in quality control, metabolism and maturation of mRNA and rRNA. From in vitro experiments it has been postulated that VapC toxins are RNases or DNases but their exact cellular target has remained elusive. Here I show that VapC encoded by Shigella flexneri 2 a virulence plasmid pMYSH 6000 and the chromosome of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT 2 are site-specific endoribonucleases that specifically cleave tRNAfMet in the anticodon stem-loop in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, I show that VapC dependent depletion of tRNAfMet leads to bacteriostatic inhibition of global translation, which surprisingly induces low-level initiation of translation at elongator codons that are correctly positioned relative to a <b>Shine</b> & <b>Dalgarno</b> <b>sequence.</b> I also show that VapC forms a complex with VapB and acts as a co-repressor of vapBC transcription. During steady state growth VapB is in excess of VapC. However, nutrient stress or treatment with antibiotics leads to Lon protease dependent decrease in VapB levels. Furthermore, I show that VapC in excess of VapB directly interferes with cooperative DNA binding of the VapBC complex, which is dependent on the dimerisation of the VapC toxin. 2 In conclusion, I show that enteric VapCs not only regulate global cellular translation by tRNAfMet cleavage, but also regulate vapBC transcription by conditional cooperativity.

This mechanism employs a dual transfer-messenger RNA molecule (tmRNA) {{together with a}} helper protein (SmpB). In this work we have used an in vitro translation system with pure components to further clarify the roles of tmRNA and SmpB in trans-translation. We found that SmpB binds ribosomes in vivo and in vitro independently of tmRNA presence and is essential for tmRNA binding and trans-peptidation. We show that two SmpB molecules can bind per ribosome, that SmpB does not leave the ribosome after trans-peptidation and that SmpB pre-bound to the ribosome can trigger trans-translation. We demonstrated {{that the rate of}} trans-transfer of a peptide from the P-site tRNA to Ala-tmRNA and the efficiency by which Ala-tmRNA competes with peptide release factors decrease with increasing the mRNA length downstream from the P site of the ribosome. We showed that trans-translation is strongly stimulated by RelE cleavage of A-site mRNA. We concluded that tmRNA action in vivo must always be preceded by mRNA truncation. We showed that rapid release of truncated mRNAs from the ribosome requires translocation of the peptidyl-tmRNA into the ribosomal P site, which is strictly EF-G dependent. mRNA release is slowed down by strong <b>Shine</b> and <b>Dalgarno</b> like <b>sequences</b> upstream the A site and by long 3 ’-extensions downstream from the P-site codon. Footprinting was used to monitor SmpB binding to tmRNA, ribosomes and subunits and to study tmRNA interactions with the ribosome at distinct trans-translation stages. We confirmed that two SmpB molecules bind per ribosome and interact with nucleotides below the L 7 /L 12 -stalk on the 50 S subunit and near the subunit interface on the 30 S. We showed that tmRNA is mostly in complex with SmpB in vivo and during trans-translation. Specific cleavage patterns of tmRNA were observed at different stages of trans-translation, but the overall tmRNA conformation seems to be maintained during the whole process...|$|R

40|$|It is {{long known}} that Kasugamycin {{inhibits}} translation of canonical transcripts containing a 5 ’-UTR with a <b>Shine</b> <b>Dalgarno</b> (SD) motif, but not that of leaderless transcripts. To gain a global overview {{of the influence of}} Kasugamycin on translation efficiencies, the changes of the translatome of Escherichia coli induced by a 10 minutes Kasugamycin treatment were quantified. The effect of Kasugamycin differed widely, 102 transcripts were at least twofold more sensitive to Kasugamycin than average, and 137 transcripts were at least twofold more resistant, and there was a more than 100 -fold difference between the most resistant and the most sensitive transcript. The 5 ’-ends of 19 transcripts were determined from treated and untreated cultures, but Kasugamycin resistance did neither correlate with {{the presence or absence of}} a SD motif, nor with differences in 5 ’-UTR lengths or GC content. RNA Structure Logos were generated for the 102 Kasugamycin-sensitive and for the 137 resistant transcripts. For both groups a short <b>Shine</b> <b>Dalgarno</b> (SD) motif was retrieved, but no specific motifs associated with resistance or sensitivity could be found. Notably, this was also true for the region - 3 to - 1 upstream of the start codon and the presence of an extended SD motif, which had been proposed to result in Kasugamycin resistance. Comparison of the translatome results with the database RegulonDB showed that the transcript with the highest resistance was leaderless, but no further leaderless transcripts were among the resistant transcripts. Unexpectedly, it was found that translational coupling might be a novel feature that is associated with Kasugamycin resistance. Taken together, Kasugamycin has a profound effect on translational efficiencies of E. coli transcripts, but the mechanism of action is different than previously described...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{translation}} initiation {{is the most}} highly regulated step of protein synthesis. In bacteria, three initiation factors (IF 1, IF 2 and IF 3) play crucial roles during initiation. IF 3 acts as an anti-association factor for the two ribosomal subunits. Eubacterial IF 3 also permits initiator tRNA (i-tRNA) selection at the P site of the ribosome. Two features of i-tRNA, i. e. the characteristic 3 GC base pairs in the anticodon stem and the cognate interaction of the anticodon sequence with the initiation codon of the mRNA contribute to IF 3 based selection and/or proofreading. However, the exact mechanism of this discrimination and {{the contribution of the}} individual domains towards this process of selection/ proofreading are unclear. Further, there are exceptional instances in the natural world where either the codon-anticodon interaction or the anticodon stem composition deviates from the norm. For instance, in mammalian mitochondria, non-AUG codons such as AUU and AUA are present in the genome although they are notoriously poor initiation codons. In addition, some species of Mycoplasma have i-tRNAs with variations in the typically conserved 3 GC base pairs of the anticodon stem. In this study, we have investigated the mechanism of proofreading activity of IF 3 of E. coli, mitochondrial and mycoplasmal origins. Part I: Proofreading function of IF 3 in E. coli IF 3 is composed of N and C terminal domains joined by a flexible linker region. By means of complete and partial IF 3 knockouts, we show that the C-terminal domain (CTD) is essential for the survival of E. coli while the N-terminal (NTD) is required for cellular fitness. Using reporter assays, we have established the role of the NTD in proofreading, while polysome profile analyses reaffirm that the CTD alone can bind to the 30 S and carry out ribosome anti-association. Therefore, we show that the CTD is the ribosome binding and anti-association domain, while the NTD is the major proofreading domain. Unpublished cryoEM structures from Prof. Ramakrishnan’s lab indicate that the NTD of IF 3 pushes the i-tRNA at its elbow and helps in P site accommodation of the i-tRNA. We propose that when the codon-anticodon interaction is non-cognate or if the 3 GC base pairs of the anticodon stem are not intact, then the dynamic action of the NTD destabilises the tRNA at the P site and leads to its rejection. Part II: Proofreading function of mitochondrial IF 3 (IF 3 mt) Of the 13 protein-coding genes in mammalian mitochondria, 3 utilise the non-canonical AUA codon and one utilises the non-canonical start codon AUU. Since IF 3 mt does not possess many of the generally conserved residues implicated in proofreading, we decided to characterise the proofreading function of IF 3 mt and its role in initiation with non-canonical start codons. Structurally, IF 3 mt is similar to EcoIF 3 with its N and C terminal domains joined by a linker region. However, IF 3 mt additionally possesses N- and C-terminal extensions which are generally disordered in structure. In vivo studies of mitochondrial translation factors have been mired by the lack of methodologies to manipulate mitochondria. We have developed an E. coli strain to study the proofreading functions of mitochondrial IF 3 (IF 3 mt) with the help of reporter genes. Consistent with its function in mitochondria, IF 3 mt allowed promiscuous initiation from non-AUG codons. However, IF 3 mt avoided initiation with i-tRNAs lacking evolutionarily conserved 3 GC pairs in anticodon stems. Interestingly, expression of IF 3 mt N-terminal domain or IF 3 mt devoid of its typical N-, and C-terminal extensions significantly improved its proofreading activity. Our immunoblot assays from polysome profile fractions indicate that the IF 3 mt derivative lacking extensions is capable of superior 30 S ribosome binding. The two derivatives of IF 3 mt missing the Next (IF 3 mtΔNext) or both the Next and Cext (IF 3 mtΔNextCext) display an affinity for the 50 S ribosome. We propose that the extensions of IF 3 mt may have evolved to reduce the affinity of IF 3 mt to the ribosome and thereby permit initiation with non-canonical start codons like AUU and AUA. Our studies suggest that E. coli provides an excellent heterologous model to study distinctive features of mitochondrial factors. Part III: Fidelity of translation initiation in mycoplasma One of the many singular features of mycoplasma is the presence of many anticodon stem variants of the i-tRNA across different species. In general, i-tRNAs are characterized by the presence of the typical feature of the conserved 3 consecutive GC base pairs (GC/GC/GC) in the anticodon stem. However, many mycoplasmal species have i-tRNAs with AU/GC/GC, GC/GC/GU or AU/GC/GU sequences. Interestingly, the mycoplasmal species which harbour the AU/GC/GU i-tRNA are also human pathogens. Therefore, we decided to investigate whether these organisms possess any unique features to accommodate the i-tRNA variants, by investigating the usage of <b>Shine</b> <b>Dalgarno</b> <b>sequences</b> and by carrying out multiple sequence alignments of genes encoding initiation factors, ribosomal proteins S 9 and S 13 and 16 S rRNA. Since IF 3 plays a crucial role in i-tRNA selection, we carried out computational analysis of mycoplasmal IF 3 sequences, which revealed many interesting features. Most striking amongst them was the variation of the highly conserved R at position 131 in some species. Interestingly, these were the very mycoplasmal species which possessed the anticodon stem variant AU/GC/GU, suggesting a strong correlation between these two features. It is known that the R 131 P mutation of EcoIF 3 is characterised by an enormous loss of proofreading activity. It seemed unusual that such compromised proofreading would be tolerated in the cell, so we decided to investigate other components of the translational machinery as well. The C-terminal SKR tail of the ribosomal protein S 9, which contacts the P-site tRNA, is highly conserved across bacteria. Analysis of the C-terminal sequences of S 9 proteins in various mycoplasmal species revealed a surprising variation- the presence of a TKR tail in strains with the AU/GC/GU tRNA. In this study we have investigated the co-occurrence of S 9 and IF 3 variations in i-tRNA selection in E. coli. We see that the R 131 P polymorphism of IF 3 leads to a tremendous loss of proofreading, but this loss is significantly tempered by the presence of the S 9 TKR variation. Our bioinformatics studies revealed that the mycoplasmal species which are sustained on AU/GC/GU i-tRNAs also tend to use a higher percentage of non-AUG codons. By means of our reporter assays in E. coli, we have shown once again that the R 131 P polymorphism of IF 3 leads to a tremendous increase in initiation with the non-canonical start codon AUA, but this increase is significantly tempered by the presence of the S 9 TKR variation...|$|R
40|$|Proteinbiosynthesis (translation) is {{a complex}} process, {{necessary}} for gene expression in all living cells. Translation involves four sequential phases, namely initiation, elongation, termination and ribosome recycling. As {{the first step of}} translation initiation is the phase which is most frequently subjected to specific regulation mechanisms. The standard mechanism in eucaryotes, canonical initiation, is a very complex pathway including a plethora of regulatory factors (initiation factors, eIFs). In addition recruitment, positioning and activation of the translation machinery needs the 5 ´-terminal cap structure of the mRNA and an ATP-dependent scanning mechanism. However, an alternative way of translation initiation exists, called internal initiation. Some mRNAs are able to bypass cap binding, scanning and the necessity of some or even all eIFs by special structured sequences in their 5 ’-UTR, the internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs). While cellular IRES containing mRNAs often code for important regulatory proteins, IRES elements of viruses are efficient tools to hijack the translational apparatus of their host cells. They are still functional, even if canonical translation initiation is impaired. The IRES element of the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and related viruses from the Flaviviridae family, such as the Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV), adopts a functionally important tertiary structure, that actively manipulates the eucaryotic ribosome. In this study we make use of the finding that in the presence of elevated Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + concentrations the HCV IRES allows total initiation factor-independent translation. This allows us to reconstitute and isolate eIF-free stable 80 S • IRES complexes in vitro, suitable for cryo-EM. The cryo-EM map of a mammalian 80 S ribosome in complex with the HCV IRES at significantly improved resolution of 7, 8 Å is presented, enabling us {{for the first time to}} present a complete molecular tertiary structure model of the HCV IRES in its ribosome bound form. This model reveals a complex tertiary fold of the IRES RNA and molecular details of its interaction with the ribosome. The proteins rpS 1 e, rpS 5 e, rpS 14 e, rpS 25, rpS 26 e, rpS 27, rpS 28 e as well as Helices h 23 and h 26 of the 18 S rRNA could be clearly identified as interaction partners in the head and platform region of the ribosomal 40 S subunit. A structural <b>Shine</b> <b>Dalgarno</b> - anti <b>Shine</b> <b>Dalgarno</b> mimicry by the IRES is proposed. Aditionally, for the first time a cryo-EM map of a mammalian 80 S ribosome in complex with the related CSFV IRES at a resolution of 10 Å is presented.

40|$|It {{was long}} assumed that {{translation}} initiation in prokaryotes generally occurs via the so-called <b>Shine</b> <b>Dalgarno</b> (SD) mechanism. Recently, {{it became clear}} that translation initiation in prokaryotes is more heterogeneous. In the haloarchaeon Haloferax volcanii, the majority of transcripts is leaderless and most transcripts with a 5 ′-UTR lack a SD motif. Nevertheless, a bioinformatic analysis predicted that 20 – 30 % of all genes are preceded by a SD motif in haloarchaea. To analyze the importance of the SD mechanism for translation initiation in haloarchaea experimentally the monocistronic sod gene was chosen, which contains a 5 ′-UTR with an extensive SD motif of seven nucleotides and a length of 19 nt, the average length of 5 ′UTRs in this organism. A translational fusion of part of the sod gene with the dhfr reporter gene was constructed. A mutant series was generated that matched the SD motif from zero to eight positions, respectively. Surprisingly, there was no correlation between the base pairing ability between transcripts and 16 S rRNA and translational efficiency in vivo under several different growth conditions. Furthermore, complete replacement of the SD motif by three unrelated sequences did not reduce translational efficiency. The results indicate that H. volcanii does not make use of the SD mechanism for translation initiation in 5 ′-UTRs. A genome analysis revealed that while the number of SD motifs in 5 ′-UTRs is rare, their fraction within open reading frames is high. Possible biological functions for intragenic SD motifs are discussed, including re-initiation of translation at distal genes in operons...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic {{antisense}} oligomers are DNA mimics {{that can}} specifically inhibit gene expression at the translational level by ribosomal steric hindrance. They bind to their mRNA targets by Watson Crick base pairing and {{are resistant to}} degradation by both nucleases and proteases. A 25 mer phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMO) and a 13 mer polyamide (peptide) nucleic acid (PNA) were designed to target mRNA (positions - 4 to + 21, and – 17 to – 5 respectively) close to the translational initiation site of the extended spectrum β lactamase resistance genes of CTX M group 1. These antisense oligonucleotides were found to inhibit β lactamase activity by up to 96 % in a cell free translation transcription coupled system using an expression vector carrying a blaCTX-M- 15 gene cloned from a clinical isolate. Despite evidence for up regulation of CTX-M gene expression, they were both found to significantly restore sensitivity to cefotaxime in E. coli AS 19, an atypical cell wall permeable mutant, in a dose dependant manner (0 - 40 nM). The PMO and PNA were covalently bound to the cell penetrating peptide (KFF) 3 K and both significantly (P< 0. 05) increased sensitivity to cefotaxime in a dose dependent manner (0 - 40 nM) in field isolates harbouring CTX-M group 1 β-lactamases.

40|$|Abstract Background Transcription is {{the first}} step in {{cellular}} information processing. It is regulated by cis -acting elements such as promoters and operators in the DNA, and trans -acting elements such as transcription factors and sigma factors. Identification of cis -acting regulatory elements on a genomic scale requires computational analysis. Results We have used oligonucleotide profiling to predict regulatory regions in a bacterial genome. The method has been applied to the Escherichia coli K 12 genome and the results analyzed. The information content of the putative regulatory oligonucleotides so predicted is validated through intra-genomic analyses, correlations with experimental data and inter-genome comparisons. Based on the results we have proposed a model for the bacterial promoter. The results show that the method is capable of identifying, in the E. coli genome, cis -acting elements such as TATAAT (sigma 70 binding site), CCCTAT (1 base relative of sigma 32 binding site), CTATNN (LexA binding site), AGGA-containing hexanucleotides (<b>Shine</b> <b>Dalgarno</b> consensus) and CTAG-containing hexanucleotides (core binding sites for Trp and Met repressors). Conclusion The method adopted is simple yet effective in predicting upstream regulatory elements in bacteria. It does not need any prior experimental data except the sequence itself. This method should be applicable to most known genomes. Profiling, as applied to the E. coli genome, picks up known cis -acting and regulatory elements. Based on the profile results, we propose a model for the bacterial promoter that is extensible even to eukaryotes. The model is that the core promoter lies within a plateau of bent AT-rich DNA. This bent DNA acts as a homing segment for the sigma factor to recognize the promoter. The model thus suggests an important role for local landscapes in prokaryotic and eukaryotic gene regulation. </p...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe ribosomal protein S 1, in Escherichia coli, is {{necessary}} for the recognition by the ribosome of the translation initiation codon of most messenger RNAs. It also participates in other functions. In particular, it stimulates the T 4 endoribonuclease RegB, which inactivates some of the phage mRNAs, when their translation is no longer required, by cleaving them {{in the middle of their}} Shine- <b>Dalgarno</b> <b>sequence.</b> In each function, S 1 seems to target very different RNAs, which led to the hypothesis that it possesses different RNA binding sites. We previously demonstrated that the ability of S 1 to activate RegB is carried by a fragment of the protein formed of three consecutive domains (domains D 3, D 4 and D 5). The same fragment plays a central role in all other functions. We analyzed its structural organization and its interactions with three RNAs: two RegB substrates and a translation initiation region. We show that these three RNAs bind the same area of the protein through a set of systematic (common to the three RNAs) and specific (RNA-dependent) interactions. We also show that, in the absence of RNA, the D 4 and D 5 domains are associated while the D 3 and D 4 domains are in equilibrium between an open (non-interacting) and a closed (weakly interacting) form and that RNA binding induces a structural reorganization of the fragment. All these results suggest that the ability of S 1 to recognize different RNAs results from a high adaptability of both its structure and its binding surface...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{translate}} an mRNA into a protein, the ribosome has to proceed through initiation, elongation, and termination steps guided by mRNA signals and auxiliary protein factors. Translation initiation is highly regulated in prokaryotes and requires the step-wise assembly of ribosomal subunits, mRNA, initiator tRNA, and initiation factors. Even though binding between the 16 S rRNA (anti-Shine Dalgarno) and its complementary sequence on the mRNA (<b>Shine</b> <b>Dalgarno)</b> {{is thought to}} be the major interaction driving translation initiation, additional cis- or trans-acting factors can also provide control. In the current work, we describe novel mRNA elements important for efficient translation initiation of the fis mRNA, which encodes a highly abundant Escherichia coli DNA binding protein. The fis mRNA is part of a bicistronic message that contains dusB at the 5 f end encoding a tRNA modifying enzyme. Even though the cellular mRNA levels are comparable, Fis protein levels are much higher than DusB. Moreover, the translation of the downstream fis coding region does not depend on translation of dusB. Rather than relying on a SD sequence, fis translation requires upstream RNA elements located within the 3 Oe end of dusB. These noncanonical elements include a conserved AU-rich sequence (AU) and a putative RNA stem-loop structure (SL). We propose that the AU element is involved in recruiting the 30 S ribosome to the translation start site, whereas the SL indirectly enhances translation initiation via an anti-inhibitory mechanism. Previous studies have shown that cellular Fis levels are determined by multiple mechanisms of transcriptional regulation, and the present work now demonstrates that multiple and unusual mechanisms of translational control are also operating. Fis functions as a global transcriptional regulator and has also been proposed {{to play a role in}} chromosome organization and compaction. To investigate Fis binding to the E. coli chromosome in vivo, genome-wide ChIP-chip binding studies were performed under different growth and mutant conditions. Fis was found to bind prolifically throughout the chromosome, and as expected, genome-wide Fis binding decreases under growth conditions that reduce fis expression. Surprisingly, Fis binding was found not to be generally influenced by other abundant nucleoid-associated proteins like HU and H-NS. We analyzed Fis binding in vitro to subclasses of Fis binding regions identified by the ChIP-chip profiles. Narrow Fis binding peaks (1. 5 kb) often contained 3 - 4 localized high-affinity Fis binding sites. These broad Fis binding regions are good candidates for chromosome organizing centers. In summary, work in this thesis advances our understanding of noncanonical translation initiation in prokaryotes and the targeted binding of the nucleoid-associated protein Fis to the E. coli chromosome...|$|R
