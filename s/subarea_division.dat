Since existing methods may not be suitable for big traffic data processing, this paper presents a MapReduce-based Parallel Three-Phase K-Means (Par 3 PKM) algorithm for solving traffic <b>subarea</b> <b>division</b> problem on a widely adopted Hadoop distributed computing platform. Specifically, we first modify the distance metric and initialization strategy of K-Means and then employ a MapReduce paradigm to redesign the optimized K-Means algorithm for parallel clustering of large-scale taxi trajectories. Moreover, we propose a boundary identifying method to connect the borders of clustering results for each cluster. Finally, we divide traffic subarea of Beijing based on real-world trajectory data sets generated by 12, 000 taxis {{in a period of}} one month using the proposed approach. Experimental evaluation results indicate that when compared with K-Means, Par 2 PK-Means, and ParCLARA, Par 3 PKM achieves higher efficiency, more accuracy, and better scalability and can effectively divide traffic subarea with big taxi trajectory data...|$|E
40|$|Advanced {{urban traffic}} signal control {{systems such as}} SCOOT and SCATS {{normally}} coordinate traffic network using multilevel hierarchical control mechanism. In this mechanism, several key intersections will be selected from traffic signal network and the network will be divided into different control subareas. Traditionally, key intersection selection and control subareas division are executed according to dynamic traffic counts and link length between intersections, which largely rely on traffic engineers’ experience. However, it omits important inherent characteristics of traffic network topology. In this paper, we will apply network analysis approach into these two aspects for traffic system control structure optimization. Firstly, the modified C-means clustering algorithm will be proposed to assess the importance of intersections in traffic network and furthermore determine the key intersections based on three indexes instead of merely on traffic counts in traditional methods. Secondly, the improved network community discovery method {{will be used to}} give more reasonable evidence in traffic control <b>subarea</b> <b>division.</b> Finally, to test the effectiveness of network analysis approach, a hardware-in-loop simulation environment composed of regional traffic control system, microsimulation software and signal controller hardware, will be built. Both traditional method and proposed approach will be implemented on simulation test bed to evaluate traffic operation performance indexes, for example, travel time, stop times, delay and average vehicle speed. Simulation results show that the proposed network analysis approach can improve the traffic control system operation performance effectively...|$|E

40|$|WGDEEP met at ICES Headquarters in Copenhagen, Denmark on 14 – 20 March 2013. The {{group was}} chaired by Tom Blasdale from the UK. Terms of Reference of the Working Group {{are given in}} Section 2. For all of the stocks {{assessed}} by WGDEEP, 2013 was {{the second year in}} a biennial advice schedule, meaning that no new advice was required this year. Available timeseries for international landings and discards, fishing effort, survey indices and biological information were updated and for all stocks and are presented in Sections 4 to 14 of the report. For some fisheries, significant discrepancies were found between official landings data supplied to ICES and scientific estimates of catches. In order to maintain the consistency of time-series (which previously used only scientific estimates), some landings have been included in the data tables as “unallocated landing” (see Section 2. 2). The working group evaluated the harvest control rule (HCR) for data-limited stocks developed by WKLIFE 2, providing generic commentary on the application of the HCR to deep-water stocks in the ICES area and specific comments on the application of the HCR in the 2012 advisory process with respect to specific stocks assessed by WGDEEP. To further develop methods to provide quantitative advice consistent with the MSY framework, WGDEEP has applied a new approach to Productivity Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) using orange roughy stocks to the west of the British Isles as a case study (Chapter 15). In response to a request from the NEAFC, the working group update descriptions of deep-water fisheries in the NEAFC and ICES areas by compiling data on catch/landings, fishing effort and known spawning areas and areas of local depletion at the finest spatial resolution possible by ICES <b>subarea</b> and <b>division</b> (Chapter 16).

40|$|In September 2003 NAFO Fisheries Commission put {{in place}} a 15 year {{rebuilding}} plan for NAFO <b>Subarea</b> 2 + <b>Divisions</b> 3 KLMNO Greenland halibut involving a step-wise reduction in TAC commencing in 2004. Previous analysis has shown that the FC rebuilding plan is not robust to uncertainty in the strength of recent year classes or to the assessment approach that is taken, and is unlikely to be successful. NAFO has yet to implement the Precautionary Approach on any fish stock. The FC rebuilding plan is considerably less cautious than one which would be specified under a Precautionary Approach and is thus inconsistent with The United Nations Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of December 10, 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks. Current fishing mortality on this stock is estimated to be more than 3 xFmax. To be compliant with the Precautionary Approach fishing mortality should be immediately reduced to below F 0. 1.

40|$|An Extended Survivors Analysis {{was applied}} to the {{commercial}} catch at age data for Greenland Halibut in NAFO <b>Subarea</b> 2 and <b>Divisions</b> 3 KLMNO from 1975 - 2001 to assess the current status of the stock. The analysis was calibrated using Canadian and European Union research vessel survey data. Stock biomass at ages 5 and older is estimated to have increased during the late 1980 's and then declined rapidly during the period of high landings in the early 1990 's. Estimated fishing mortality has followed the trend in landings, increasing rapidly in the early 1990 's, remaining high as the stock was reduced to its historic lows and then declining to the low levels recorded during 1985 – 1990. The reduction in exploitation has resulted from both a decrease in the recorded landings and an increase in biomass following the better than average recruitment of the 1993 - 1995 year-classes. However, the assessment is considered to be very uncertain with respect to absolute estimates of stock size and it does not match the historic trends in the stock as illustrated by the longest survey series. The increasing trend in the late 1990 s is believed to be reflective of the stock trajectory during that period, however, the continued increasing trend since then is inconsistent with the trends in stock size from all other major sources. Given these concerns, the assessment in its present form therefore is considered unreliable for projecting future stock trends and potential catch levels. Dat...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide a deep study of the quality of the tuning series apply in the Greenland halibut {{assessment}} of the NAFO <b>Subarea</b> 2 and <b>Divisions</b> 3 KLMNO, as well as to study the feasibility of including the Spanish 3 NO survey as tuning fleet in future assessments of this stock. Our results may indicated that the Canadian autumn survey have a clear year effect in the 1995 data for ages older than 6 and that this could be due to the lowest depth coverage of the survey in 1995 compared to 1996 - 2003. Therefore, shortening the Canadian autumn survey index to 1996 - 2003 the fit of the data improve and, consequently, we propose to eliminate the 1995 data of this survey in the assessment. The Canadian spring survey showed a big trend in the log q errors of ages 7 and 8, so it could be convenient to study the possibility of shortening the age range of this tuning indices to ages 1 to 6. The study also showed that the fit of the Spanish 3 NO survey is not very good for ages less than 5 years old, being the information given good for ages between 5 and 12 and, thus, it could be feasible to include this information in future assessments. The within, between surveys abundance correlations and the correlations between surveys and XSA abundance showed that surveys have many difficulties to track the ages 7, 8 and 9.

40|$| I and II, Vb and VIa {{and finally}} other areas, {{assessment}} {{were carried out}} and advice will be delivered for these three units. In areas I and II, data from Norwegian fisheries do not show any negative trends in recent years. Larger and older fish are caught from Norwegian surveys than from the fisheries in the same area. Acoustic biomass estimates in 2012 show some reduction compared to 2009, but marked upward trend again in 2014. Trawl cpue series show an upward trend since 2004. The advice for greater silver smelt in Vb and VIa is based on trends in cpue (kg/hour) from the Faroese summer survey on the Faroe Plateau, which show a slight decrease in the latest years. In 2014, the Faroese authorities set a law of species-specific management of greater silver smelt for Faroese waters. The TAC in 2014 was 16 000 tons and the TAC for 2015 was 14 400 tons. Six trawlers have licences to direct fishery of greater silver smelt. The regulation also includes limitations in e. g. bycatch, mesh size and fishing area. The EU introduced TAC management in 2003. For 2013 the EU TAC was set to 4316 tons in area V, VI, VII. For 2014 and 2016 the EU TAC was set to {{the same as in}} 2013 (V, VI, VII = 4316 tons). Most, if not all, of theEU TAC is caught in ICES Division VIa, therefore from the Vb–VIa stock unit. The fishery is smaller in other areas where the species is also discarded by various fisheries in quantities that could not be estimated. Little new data and no new assessment were presented for orange roughy in 2015. The species appears is very small amount in discards of some fleets in EU waters. There is a Faroese fishery on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. For this particularly long-lived species, the results Productivity Susceptibility Analysis (PSA) presented in 2013 re-main appropriate and do no need yearly updating. The status of the roundnose grenadier stocks are varied. Roundnose grenadier in Vb, VI, VII and XIIb is assessed using a Bayesian surplus production model since 2010. The fishing pressure in recent years is estimated low, the biomass is slowly rebuild-ing after two decades of overexploitation. No advice is required in 2015. Exploratory assessments were carried out using the abundance indices from the Marine Scotland Deepwater Science Survey instead of the usual French tallybook indices (which was also run for comparison between models). Estimated trends in stock biomass using the survey of the tallybook indices are consistent. However, the stock biomass in re-cent years is estimated to increase at a substantially higher rate when the model is fit to the survey index. The survey covers the main distribution range of thee stock and the main fishing grounds. It is therefore most likely to provide a realistic index of the stock abundance. It may further be conservative as it does not cover the fully area of distribution part of which has not been fished in recent years. WGDEEP proposed the stock for benchmarking in 2017, in order to review the use of biomass indices and investigate alternative to the current assessment model. The fishery for roundnose grenadier in Division IIIa has been stopped since 2006 and landings are now insignificant. The bycatch from other fisheries is also low. The only information to assess this stock is now a Norwegian survey index from the same area. This index has shown a declining trend since 2006 and is now at the lowest level rec-orded during the time-series from 1984. The state of roundnose grenadier stocks on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge is unclear owing to limited data. This stock was intensively exploited in the 1970 s and 1980 s, the fishery declined in the 1990 s and was insignifi-cant in the 2000 s and resumed in 2011. In other areas, roundnose grenadier is only a bycatch and catch are insignificant. An assessment and advice was requested for the roughhead grenadier (Macrourus berglax) in the Northeast Atlantic owing to landings reported in previous years. Data were compiled and a catch based advice was prepared. This species is caught and subject to TAC management in the NAFO area. In the ICES area, it occurs at a much lower level, it is however known to occur at east Greenland (Division XIVb, Iceland (Va), Faroe Islands (Vb), Northern North Sea (IVa), Norwegian and Barents Sea (I and II). The landings level reported in some previous years were not plausible as high densities are not known to occur in reported catch areas. An advice reflecting possi-ble level of sustainable catch was prepared. Similarly, an assessment and advice was requested for the roundsnout grenadier (Trachyrincus scabrus) in the Northeast Atlantic (see chapter 15). This species is con-sidered to have none or only minor commercial interest. The request for an advice came from landings reported in previous years. These landings were considered to be either minor bycatch or species misreporting. The advice is that the possible small landings of the species are counted against existing roundnose and roughhead gren-adiers TACs. The assessment of black scabbardfish was benchmarked at WKDEEP 2014. This spe-cies was formerly assessed in three units in the ICES area. Although no final conclu-sion is reached all available evidence suggest that a single stock does a large clockwise migrations in the Northeast Atlantic and further south in the CECAF areas where spawning occurs. Whether fish in Azorean waters and on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (ICES Subareas X and XII) belongs to the same widely distributed stock is un-certain and the picture in Subarea X is further blurred by the mixing with the closely related intermediate scabbardfish (Aphanopus intermedius). Greater forkbeard is caught mostly as a bycatch. Adults are a landed bycatch in slope fisheries for hake, monkfish, megrims and deep-water species and juveniles are a discarded bycatch in numerous fisheries. The assessment is based upon indices from four surveys. The increasing trend in abundance and biomass in recent years seems to be reverting. Time-series of survey indices display pluri-annual fluctuations, prob-ably related to recruitment variability. Alfonsinos are a mixture of two species (Beryx splendens and Beryx decadactylus. These species are oceanic demersal species occurring at the top of seamounts and along slopes, where they form local aggregations. They are widespread in the Northeast Atlantic from Iceland to the Azores and along the continental slope, in particular to the west of Iberia and Bay of Biscay. The stock structure is uncertain and data very limited. Although a longline survey is carried out in the Azores, where most of the catch occur, the reliably of survey indices is uncertain for these species owing to their large and patchy spatial distributions. As a consequence, the perception of the status of these stocks relies primarily on catch trends. Three stocks of blackspot sea bream are assessed by WGDEEP. In ICES Subarea IX Target fishery only take places in the Strait of Gibraltar, while the species is taken as a bycatch of artisanal fleets which uses mainly longlines. In 2014, landings and lpue from the Spanish “voracera” target fishery seemed increasing and the mean length in the catchwas slightly larger. However, the VMS-based lpue developed in recent years could not be updated and the assessment this stock is undermined by the lack of data from the Mediterranean and CECAF area as the same stockstraddles over ICES, CE-CAF and GFCM areas, where management regimes are different. Although no advice is given in 2015 for blackspot sea bream stocks, the WGDEEP report reminds that a recovery plan involving all parties is necessary for this stock. The stock of the same species in the Azores (ICES Subarea X) also showed signs of overexploitation. Ex-ploratory analyses of the natural and fishing mortalities were conducted using catch curves in order to investigate optimal exploitation reference points (yield-per-recruit analysis). Results show that modelling the fraction of population that change sex is a key issue to better estimating the trajectory of the spawning biomass. Data collection on sex ratio, maturity and sex change has been updated and analysed. Traditional models should be extended to incorporate the sex change issue. The third blackspot sea bream stock in ICES Subareas VI, VII and VIII remains at a low level, since it col-lapsed in the 1980 s. In response to a request from the NEAFC, the working group update descriptions of deep-water fisheries in the NEAFC and ICES areas by compiling data on catch/landings, fishing effort and known spawning areas and areas of local deple-tionat the finest spatial resolution possible by ICES <b>subarea</b> and <b>division</b> (Chapter 15) ...|$|R
