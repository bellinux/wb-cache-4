Ari knows Alan is a compulsive gambler so intends to hustle Alan, and bet Vince into the movie. However, his plan backfires because Alan's golf instructor is none other than Phil Mickelson. After Ari loses a close game to Alan, Alan becomes enraged because Ari brought up the subject of Vince and <b>Smoke</b> <b>Jumpers</b> after promising he wouldn't. Alan becomes so angry that he has a heart attack on the golf course and dies. At Alan's funeral Ari speaks with John Ellis, Alan's boss. Ari tells Ellis that Alan promised Vincent <b>Smoke</b> <b>Jumpers,</b> but Ellis has other things to discuss with Ari. He wants Ari to take Alan's old job and run Warner Bros. Pictures. This would put Ari in a position to not only get Vince back on <b>Smoke</b> <b>Jumpers,</b> but to give Vince roles in any future films financed by Warner Bros. Studio. When Vince hears this information, he has a bittersweet feeling because he wants to do <b>Smoke</b> <b>Jumpers,</b> but he doesn't want to lose Ari as his agent. Ari reconsiders taking the job, but gets bad news from his fellow Hollywood friend and former flame, Dana Gordon. Vince's former agent Amanda Daniels would run the studio if Ari doesn't take the job.

50|$|Vince {{returns to}} California {{ready to work}} after {{spending}} months relaxing in Mexico with Turtle. Medellin has gone straight-to-DVD and made numerous worst-of-the-year lists, with Vince's performance also being heavily criticized. Eric receives a script {{from a pair of}} unknown screenwriters trying to get a break in Hollywood called Nine Brave Souls, in which Eric sees potential. Eric gets Edward Norton and Amanda Daniels (Carla Gugino) interested, and they change the name of the film to <b>Smoke</b> <b>Jumpers.</b> When Ari reads the script of <b>Smoke</b> <b>Jumpers</b> he convinces Eric to start a bidding war for the film with Vince attached. Amanda refuses to participate and passes on it until later reconsidering and making an offer. However, Alan Gray (Paul Ben-Victor), the man who fired Vince from the sequel to Aquaman, outbids them.|$|R
5000|$|During World War II he chose, {{instead of}} fighting, to {{volunteer}} for the Civilian Public Service.1. [...] Hulbert, being a Quaker, was a pacifist for moral reasons.5 [...] People in the Civilian Public Service were conscientious objectors to the war {{who worked in the}} United States in the areas of soil conservation, forestry, fire fighting, agriculture, social services and mental health. While in the Civilian Public Service, Hulbert performed range reseeding research in Montana and worked as a 'smoke jumper'. [...] A 'smoke jumper' is a [...] "wildland firefighter who specializes in parachuting to fires in remote areas."

50|$|Helicopters can {{hover over}} the fire and drop water or retardant. The S-64 Helitanker has {{microprocessor-controlled}} doors on its tank. The doors are controlled based on the area to be covered and wind conditions. Fixed-wing aircraft must make a pass and drop water or retardant like a bomber. Spotter (Air Tactical Group Supervisor) aircraft often orbit the fire at a higher altitude to coordinate {{the efforts of the}} <b>smoke</b> <b>jumper,</b> helicopter, media, and retardant-dropping aircraft; while lead planes fly low-level ahead of the airtankers to mark the trajectory for the drop, and ensure overall safety for both ground-based and aerial firefighters.Water is usually dropped directly on flames because its effect is short-lived. Fire retardants are typically dropped ahead of the moving fire or along its edge and may remain effective for two or more days. This can create artificial firebreaks where the terrain is too rugged or remote for ground crews to cut fireline.|$|E
50|$|Unfortunately, Vince has heated {{confrontations}} {{with the director}} of <b>Smoke</b> <b>Jumpers.</b> The director fires Vince from {{the set of the}} movie. This leads to an altercation between the director and Dana, Ari, Vince, E, and John Ellis. John Ellis makes an executive decision to drop the project and Vince, E, Turtle, and Drama head back to Queens.|$|R
50|$|Ari goes to Amanda's {{office to}} try and bury the hatchet with Amanda. Ari offers {{to turn down the}} job if she puts Vince in <b>Smoke</b> <b>Jumpers.</b> Amanda calls Ari's bluff {{thinking}} {{that he is going to}} turn down the job anyway. This makes Ari extremely angry, and he storms out of Amanda's office to go meet with John Ellis. Vince goes to meet with Ari under the assumption that Ari had taken the position at the studio. However, to everyone's surprise Ari turned down the job. He informs Vince and Eric that he recommended his friend Dana Gordon, and she was given the job as studio head instead of Amanda. During Vince's meeting with Ari, Dana calls to thank Ari for the recommendation. On speakerphone, Dana assures Vincent that he is in <b>Smoke</b> <b>Jumpers</b> for his full quote. Ari is still Vince's agent, Eric's best friend's career is back on track, Vince is no longer in danger of going bankrupt, and is no longer in danger of ending his movie career on a box office bomb.|$|R

50|$|After {{a series}} of {{meetings}} with every studio in town ends with no one wanting to cast Vince as a lead in anything, Vince asks Ari about the possibility of pursuing a supporting role in a new big-budget film called <b>Smoke</b> <b>Jumpers,</b> a script that Eric found with Edward Norton attached as the lead. Ari attempts to secure the second lead for Vince, but finds out that the film has become property of Warner Bros., a studio that refuses to hire Vince after Vince demanded $20 million to do the Aquaman sequel and was subsequently fired from the franchise.|$|R
50|$|Unfortunately for Vince, Edward Norton {{wants to}} buy the script along with Alan Gray, head of Warner Bros. Studios, for $1,000,000 against $2,000,000 if the movie is made. Vince loses his {{supporting}} role because Warner Bros. purchases the film. Vince now has a difficult career move to make. He can hold out for a movie he likes, and risk going bankrupt, or he can do a new Benji film for $3,000,000. Thinking it will hurt his chances to regain {{his status as a}} movie star, Vince chooses to forgo Benji. He decides he {{must find a way to}} get back on <b>Smoke</b> <b>Jumpers.</b>|$|R
5|$|Hundreds of men {{volunteered for}} smoke jumping, showing their {{willingness}} to take great personal risks. When fire was detected by a lookout, <b>smoke</b> <b>jumpers</b> were flown directly to the site and dropped by parachute to quickly contain and extinguish the fire. From base camps scattered through the forests of Montana, Idaho and Oregon, the men were flown as many as 200 miles to fire sites, carrying firefighting tools and a two-day supply of K-rations. For larger fires, additional men, supplies and food were airdropped to expand the effort. Up to 240 CPS men served in this specialized program. One of the smokejumping schools was at Camp Paxson in Montana.|$|R
50|$|Ari, {{determined}} to get Vince the role he desires, challenges Alan to {{a round of golf}} for the part. When Alan beats Ari, they get into a heated argument, causing Alan to drop dead of a heart attack. At Alan's funeral, Ari takes the opportunity to ask John Ellis (Alan Dale), Alan's boss, about giving the role to Vince. Ellis instead offers him Alan's position as president of the studio, with Amanda as the number-two choice for the job. Rather than accepting the offer and abandoning his clients, Ari instead gets Dana Gordon (Constance Zimmer) the job, therefore locking up <b>Smoke</b> <b>Jumpers</b> for Vince.|$|R
5000|$|The Aerial Forest Protection Service (Авиалесоохрана, or Avialesookhrana) is a Russian {{government}} agency charged primarily with the aerial management of forest fires. It {{is considered a}} branch of the Russian Federal Forest Service. It is famous for the creation and use of smoke jumpers; paratroopers who parachute down into villages {{in the path of the}} fire to warn them and assist in evacuation procedures. <b>Smoke</b> <b>jumpers</b> also jump directly into forest fires to assist with fire extinguishing. [...] Until 2007, the Avialesookhrana was the only Russian organization charged with handling forest fires. They are also credited with helping the Republic of Mongolia and Cuba create their own forest fire prevention agencies.|$|R
5000|$|Ari {{arranges}} to {{play golf}} with WB studio head Alan Gray {{in an effort to}} [...] "bet" [...] Vince into the film by hustling Alan at golf only to find that Alan has significantly improved his game after taking private lessons from Phil Mickelson. After Ari loses his wager, Alan, furious at Ari for even bringing up Vince's name, suffers a fatal heart attack. Shortly thereafter, Ari is offered the chance to succeed him by the studio's chairman John Ellis for $10 million. Ari is not sure what to do: if he takes the job, he could give Vince any role he wanted with the studio, but it would also mean that he couldn't be Vince's agent, which could also end their friendship. He decides to turn the job down, but then he learns that Amanda Daniels - who still holds a grudge against Vince and Ari - is next in line for the job. Ari attempts to make peace with her, offering to put his full support behind her for the job as long as she agrees to add Vince as the second lead in <b>Smoke</b> <b>Jumpers.</b> Saying that Vince isn't good enough, she refuses, adding that, [...] "Ari can kiss his relationship with the studio goodbye." [...] Ari then declares that he will accept the job to spite her, but instead convinces John Ellis to give the position to Dana Gordon. Not only does this guarantee Vince the second lead in <b>Smoke</b> <b>Jumpers</b> but it also repairs his relationship with Dana, which had suffered considerable damage after the fallout over Medellin and SILO.|$|R
50|$|At the end {{of season}} 5, things take a bad turn as Vince is being {{deliberately}} phased out of <b>Smoke</b> <b>Jumpers</b> by the emotionally volatile director, Verner Vollstedt, who doesn't believe Vince has any real talent. The director eventually fires Vince and Ari arrives on the set to inform him {{that he has no}} authority to fire anyone, threatening to go directly to the studio if Verner doesn't continue to do the movie with Vince. The studio decides to shut down production altogether, leaving Vince broke and unemployed. He returns to his mother's home in Queens where Ari tracks him down several days later and puts Vince in touch with Martin Scorsese who offers Vince the lead role of Nick Carroway in The Great Gatsby.|$|R
30|$|In {{the past}} half century, {{wildland}} fire managers in the US has developed an increasingly sophisticated suppression response organization, including large aircraft, <b>smoke</b> <b>jumpers,</b> infrared mapping, satellite detection, computer dispatching, fire simulation, and nationwide coordination. Between 2011 and 2014, federal expenditures on suppressing large wildfires have exceeded $ 1.5 each year (National Interagency Fire Center 2014), but wildfires are becoming larger and more expensive and damages to watersheds and communities are still rising. Do these outcomes evince success of a suppression-centric strategy? Are practical alternatives available? In this article we review the structure of US wildfire management organizations. Attention {{is given to the}} incentives for agencies as well as the public. Evaluation of incentives and consequences within the framework of actuarial risk assessment reveals that modern wildfire problems derive from the self-reinforcing cycle of counter-effective actions.|$|R
5000|$|In early 1942 May {{asked for}} volunteers from his {{civilian}} servicing crew, {{and about a}} dozen agreed to join. With basically no equipment, the instruction consisted of [...] "jump and pull" [...] and windage was calculated by throwing an Eaton's catalogue out the door. Early operations were comical, but in early 1943 May sent two volunteers, Owen Hargreaves and Scotty Thompson to the <b>smoke</b> <b>jumpers</b> school in Missoula, Montana to be trained by the U.S. Forest Service. After six weeks they returned home with borrowed steerable equipment to train two other volunteers, Wilfred Rivet and Laurie Poulsom. Soon the unit was conducting operational jumps, and by 1944 May's persistence had paid off and an official para-rescue training program started. For his work, May was awarded a Presidential Medal of Freedom with Bronze Palm in 1947 by the USAAF.|$|R
50|$|<b>Smoke</b> <b>Jumpers</b> begins filming, {{but after}} several {{conflicts}} between Vince and director Verner Vollstedt (Stellan Skarsgård), {{which leads to}} Verner firing Vince, production is halted by Ellis. The boys return to New York City, where Vince pursues a role in Gus Van Sant's new film. Eric persistently tries to convince Van Sant that Vince is right for the film, but Van Sant says not for his current film, but would love {{to work with him}} in the future. After discovering Van Sant said no, Vince becomes upset and fires Eric, believing that Eric had made him look desperate. A frustrated E returns to Hollywood to concentrate on another client, a young and rising comedian named Charlie (Bow Wow). Vince later apologizes after learning that Eric's persistence led to an offer by Martin Scorsese for a lead in his next feature, a re-envisioning of The Great Gatsby set in the Upper West Side of New York City. The guys return to Hollywood.|$|R
50|$|During World War II Fort Benning had 197,159 acres (797.87 km²) with billeting {{space for}} 3,970 {{officers}} and 94,873 enlisted persons. Among many other units, Fort Benning {{was the home}} of the 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion, their training began in December 1943 and was an important milestone for black Americans, as was explored in the first narrative history of the installation, Home of the Infantry. The battalion, later expanded to become the 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion, was trained at Fort Benning but did not deploy overseas and never saw combat during World War II. During this period, the specialized duties of the Triple Nickel were primarily in a firefighting role, with over one thousand parachute jumps as <b>smoke</b> <b>jumpers.</b> The 555th was deployed to the Pacific Northwest of the United States in response to the concern that forest fires were being set by the Japanese military using long-range incendiary balloons. The 82nd Armored Reconnaissance Battalion was activated July 15, 1940, and trained at the Fort. The 17th Armored Engineer Battalion became active and started training July 15, 1940.|$|R
50|$|Vince {{is offered}} a lead role (Nick Carraway) in Martin Scorsese's adaptation/update of The Great Gatsby {{set in the}} 1980s, {{courtesy}} of Gus Van Sant's liking of Vince's <b>Smoke</b> <b>Jumpers</b> footage. After the massive success of Gatsby, Vince is set to star in the upcoming biopic about Enzo Ferrari directed by Frank Darabont. After production of the Ferrari movie was delayed, Vince {{spends most of his}} time relaxing. During this period of delayed production on Ferrari, Vince is paid $4,000,000 to provide the voice of a dog in an animated movie (although the actual title and success of the movie is never revealed). One night he awoke and heard noises and came to the conclusion that the house had been broken into, so Ari recommended a high-security connection that he had to hopefully track down the stalker, but it turned out to be sorority girls who had stolen Turtle's boxers because he was Jamie-Lynn Sigler's boyfriend. Vince then traveled to Italy with Johnny Drama and Turtle to begin the Ferrari picture, while Eric stayed in LA with his new fiancee Sloan McQuewick.|$|R
