5|$|Allison Moore, {{a college}} friend of Tartakovsky, was cast as Dee Dee. She left the show {{after the first}} season because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> {{interested}} in voice acting. The role was subsequently recast with Kat Cressida.

5|$|HMS Royal Oak {{was one of}} five s {{built for}} the Royal Navy during the First World War. Launched in 1914 and {{completed}} in 1916, Royal Oak first saw combat at the Battle of Jutland {{as part of the}} Grand Fleet. In peacetime, she served in the Atlantic, Home and Mediterranean fleets, more than once coming under accidental attack. The ship drew worldwide attention in 1928 when her senior officers were controversially court-martialled. Attempts to modernise Royal Oak throughout her 25-year career could not fix her fundamental lack of speed and by the start of the Second World War, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> suited to front-line duty.|$|E
5|$|On {{their way}} home to Devonshire, Elinor and Marianne stop for {{the night at the}} country estate of the Palmers, who live five and a half miles away from Willoughby's estate. Marianne cannot resist going to see the estate; she becomes gravely ill {{trekking}} up a hill in a torrential rain. Colonel Brandon finds her in the rain and brings her home. Elinor stays at her side until she recovers, and the sisters return home. Colonel Brandon and Marianne begin spending time together, as Marianne has a new appreciation for him. She admits to Elinor that even if Willoughby had chosen her, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> convinced that love would have been enough to make him happy.|$|E

5|$|Throughout her career, Godwin worked {{consistently}} {{with her}} agent, John Hawkins, but worked with several different publishing houses. Godwin's early books were published by Knopf. After the editor for The Perfectionists, David Segal, died suddenly {{of a heart}} attack, Robert Gottlieb from Knopf became her editor for her next four books. Godwin credits Gottlieb {{for much of the}} success of her early works. Later on, when Godwin's then-recent books were less widely read, USA Today commented that this could be in part because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> working with Gottlieb. After Knopf, Godwin contracted with Viking, who offered larger advances and more publicity for her books.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of World War II, both Parker Brothers and Waddington stockpiled {{materials}} they could use for further game production. During the war, Monopoly was produced with wooden tokens in the U.S., and the game's cellophane cover was eliminated. In the UK, metal tokens were also eliminated, and a special spinner was introduced {{to take the place}} of dice. The game remained in print for a time even in the Netherlands, as the printer there was able to maintain a supply of paper. Elizabeth Magie's second patent on The Landlord's Game expired in September, 1941, and it is believed that after the expiration, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> promoted as an inventor of Monopoly. The game itself remained popular during the war, particularly in camps, and soldiers playing the game became part of the product's advertising in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Cormoran {{was based}} in Tsingtao with {{unusable}} engines; she was scuttled in the harbor since <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> operational. Geier briefly operated against British shipping in the Pacific before having to put into Hawaii for internment by the then-neutral United States. After the United States entered the war in April 1917, she was seized and commissioned into the US Navy as USS Schurz; she served as an escort until she was accidentally sunk following a collision with a freighter in June 1918. Seeadler and Condor, meanwhile, had been converted into mine storage hulks {{after the start of}} the war. Seeadler was destroyed by an accidental explosion in 1917. Condor was {{the only member of the}} class to survive the war, and she was scrapped in 1921.|$|E

5|$|In 2004, Forbes named Rowling as {{the first}} person to become a U.S.-dollar billionaire by writing books, the second-richest female {{entertainer}} and the 1,062nd richest person in the world. Rowling disputed the calculations and said she had plenty of money, but was not a billionaire. The 2016 Sunday Times Rich List estimated Rowling's fortune at Â£600million, ranking her as the joint 197th richest person in the UK. In 2012, Forbes removed Rowling from their rich list, claiming that her US$160 million in charitable donations and the high tax rate in the UK meant <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> a billionaire. In February 2013 she was assessed as the 13th most powerful woman in the United Kingdom by Woman's Hour on BBC Radio 4.|$|E
5|$|On 9 January 1914, Seeadler {{departed}} East Africa for {{the last}} time, bound for Germany. She had spent nearly thirteen {{and a half years}} abroad, the longest uninterrupted period of overseas service of any major German warship. Her replacement, her sister , had not yet arrived but was en route. Seeadler stopped in Aden on 22 January, and arrived in Kiel on 18 March. She was then moved to Danzig and decommissioned. On 6 May 1914, she was reclassified as a gunboat. After the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, she was reduced to a hulk for storing naval mines since <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> fit for active service. She was towed to Wilhelmshaven and anchored in the outer roadstead. On 19 April 1917, her cargo exploded while she was moored in the Jade outside Wilhelmshaven. The explosion destroyed the ship, but there were no casualties; her wreck was never raised.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} Fonda took ballet class to keep fit, but after {{fracturing}} her foot while filming The China Syndrome, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> able to participate. To compensate, she began participating in aerobics and strengthening exercises {{under the direction}} of Leni Cazden. The Leni Workout became the Jane Fonda Workout, which began a second career for her, continuing for many years. This was considered one of the influences that started the fitness craze among baby boomers, then approaching middle age. In 1982, Fonda released her first exercise video, titled Jane Fonda's Workout, inspired by her best-selling book, Jane Fonda's Workout Book. Jane Fonda's Workout became the highest selling home video of the next few years, selling over a million copies. The video's release led many people to buy the then-new VCR in order to watch and perform the workout at home. The exercise videos were produced and directed by Sidney Galanty, who helped to put the deal together with video distributor Stuart Karl, of Karl Home Video. Galanty produced the first video and 11 more after that. She would subsequently release 23 workout videos with the series selling a total of 17 million copies combined, more than any other exercise series. She released five workout books and thirteen audio programs, through 1995. After a fifteen-year hiatus, she released two new fitness videos on DVD in 2010, aiming at an older audience.|$|E
