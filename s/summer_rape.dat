40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{greenhouse}} investigation was to test a multichannel oxygen flux meter (Fig. 7) which was first designed by Armstrong & Wright (1976). The aim was to determine values of oxygen diffusion rate (ODR) critical {{for the growth of}} <b>summer</b> <b>rape</b> in two different clay soils from the middle part of Sweden (Table 1). A further aim was to study the effects of irrigation and soil compaction on ODR and to measure redoxpotential in the two soils. Undisturbed soil samples were extracted from the soil surface in steel cylinders with a height of 10 cm and a diameter of 7. 2 cm. Different soil water suctions were applied to the samples and <b>summer</b> <b>rape</b> was sown on a number of cylinders. ODR was measured with a bare platinum electrode which was forced into the soil to a depth of 1. 5 cm. A reference silver electrode was also lightly but firmly pressed into the soil. The leads from the two electrodes were connected to the oxygen flux meter which maintained an effective voltage of 0. 65 V across the electrodes. An electric current resulted from the reduction of oxygen at the platinum surface and was assumed to be proportional to ODR in the surrounding soil solution (lemon & Erickson, 1952). The current was allowed to flow for 4 minutes before a reading was taken. In an initial experiment (Fig. 9) it was concluded that the steel cylinder would have no measurable disturbing effect on the current. The same pair of electrodes was used to register the redoxpotential of the soil sample, but in this measurement no voltage was applied to the system. ODR values greatly varied within as well as between soil samples, probably due to the heterogenicy of soil (lemon & Erickson, 1952). Despite this, the statistical significance of an increase in ODR values with a decrease in water content was high for most samples studied (Tables 4 and 6). In general, low ODR values were obtained as a result of irrigation (Diagrams 14 - 20) and soil compaction (Diagrams 5 - 6 and 9 - 10). There was a tendency for ODR to increase with increase in redoxpotential (Diagrams 23 - 24). Despite the low ODR values of ten obtained (less than 2 pmol m- 2 s-l) the growth of rape was normal in all noncompacted samples (Diagrams 25 - 26). This was probably due to the high percentage of roots growing on the outer surface of the sample next to the cylinder wall, where the oxygen supply was assumed to be more adequate than inside the soil sample. Because of this, {{it was not possible to}} determine a critical ODR value for the growth of <b>summer</b> <b>rape</b> in these samples. Regarding the results obtained from this investigation, it can be Concluded that the ODR method is a good indicator of soil aeration status and a complement to other existing methods of measuring soil aeration...|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{different}} levels of water deficit applied during rapeseed crop development were assessed in a trial with metallic pots in greenhouse at the Department of Agricultural Engineering of Kassel University, Witzenhausen, Germany. A randomized block design was used with one cultivar (Ability <b>Summer</b> <b>Rape)</b> and three levels of water deficit (0, 30, and 60 % of evapotranspiration) in three treatments and 20 replicates. Irrigation management was carried out through daily water balance, where ET = I – D; ET: evapotranspiration; I: irrigation; and D: drainage. The following evaluations were carried out weekly: stem diameter (mm); plant height (cm); number of leaves; number of branches and number of pods. At {{the end of the}} experiment, assessed total green matter (g plant- 1), total dry matter (g plant- 1), grain yield (g plant- 1), grain protein content (%) and grain oil content (%) were also assessed. Data were submitted to variance analysis and the effect of the treatments was assessed by regression analysis. Results showed significant differences between the treatments in all analysed variables except for plant height and grain protein content, by test F at 5 % probability. Factor of response ky, indicator of crop sensitivity to water deficit, was lower than one for all assessed variables. Grain yield showed the highest sensitivity to water deficit. Index terms: Water management, irrigation, water deficit. RESUMO Os efeitos de diferentes níveis de déficit hídrico, aplicados durante o desenvolvimento da canola, foram avaliados por meio d...|$|E

40|$|An {{alternative}} {{sowing time}} for <b>summer</b> turnip <b>rape</b> (Brassica rapa L. var. oleifera subvar. annua) and canola rape (Brassica napus L. var. oleifera subvar. annua) was investigated under northern European growing conditions, where {{the growing season}} is very short and seedling establishment in spring is difficult. Using a method termed carrier technology, seeds of spring canola were coated with polymer and sown in winter or early spring. Two types of polymer were tested: water-impervious PoligenÆÊWE 3 (polyethylene wax at five rates depending on experiment) and water-soluble, freeze sensitive ExtenderÆÊ (GrowTech at 3 % of seed weight). Four separate field experiments at two locations (Jokioinen, 60 ¢X 81 ¡¦N and Mietoinen, 60 ¢X 38 ¡¦N) and two laboratory experiments were carried out in 2002 ¡V 2004. Early sowing times were used in combination with autumn control of weeds using non-selective herbicides and broadcast sowing onto cereal stubble to promote cost-efficiency. Such sowing method failed to produce even plant stands, as only few seedlings emerged. The polymer coatings were successful and the water-soluble, freeze sensitive polymer designed to allow an alternative sowing time performed well in laboratory tests. Large numbers of early sown coated and control seeds remained viable {{until the end of}} spring. Under field conditions germination or seedling establishment failed probably due to poor seed-to-soil contact. Moreover, unfavourable winter and spring conditions likely resulted in lack of synchrony between adequate temperature and water availability needed for seed imbibition and germination. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this project}} we {{produced}} 404 transgenic summer and 97 transgenic winter rape plants. We tested several transformation protocols with different explants and made additional work for optimiation of the method. In our hands {{the method of}} Moloney et al. 1989 (with a few modifications) was {{the most effective and}} leaded to the quickest results. At the end of the project, rooted transgenic plants could be produced in less than 4 month. The transformation efficiency for the cotyledon transformation method was for <b>summer</b> <b>rape</b> (variety 'DRAKKAR') diameter 9 - 10 % and for winter rape (variety 'ERROX') diameter 5 - 6 %. The transformation work was done with 25 different constructs, which were constructed of the other collaborating working groups in Cologne and Hamburg. The strains of Agrobacterium fumefaciens used for transformation were GV 3101 and C 58 ATHV. All transgenic plants rooted on 50 mg/l kanamycin (as selective antibiotica) and were tested as positive in an additional NPT-ELISA test. All the plants were given to the other working groups for further experiments or assays. Furthermore we produced transgenic seeds in our greenhouses in Einbeck. These seeds are now available for further investigations relating to the modification of the fatty acids and further breeding work. (orig.)

40|$|Energy {{crops are}} a non-fossil fuel {{that can provide}} solid, liquid and gaseous fuels which may be stored and transported. In Sweden winter wheat, {{rapeseed}} and Salix are crops which are very suitable for energy use, since they suit the climatic conditions and are grown using well-established technology. However, {{it is important that}} the production of bioenergy supplies more energy than that required for production. Besides this, it is important to know how the energy quality, exergy, is affected during production and by using both energy and exergy analysis it is possible to determine not only the quantity of the energy used, but also its quality. The objective for this study was to analyse the rapeseed oil methyl ester (RME) production chain and the cultivation of winter wheat, <b>summer</b> turnip <b>rape,</b> winter rape and Salix with respect to their energy use and exergy consumption. The objective was also to identify the stages in the production chain that accounted for the largest energy use and exergy consumption and to see how the production chain would be affected by introducing different production strategies. The energy and exergy analyses were performed using process analysis methodology. Energy and exergy ratios and net outputs were calculated and the links in the production chain accounting for the largest energy use and exergy consumption were identified. Different production strategies were studied in order to make the production process more energy and exergy effective. The study showed that the cultivation of winter wheat, rapeseed and Salix yielded more energy and exergy than they required during production. The whole RME production chain also had larger energy and exergy outputs than inputs. The study further showed that fertilisers accounted for a large part of the total energy use and exergy consumption. However, this energy use and exergy consumption due to use of fertilisers could be markedly decreased by using alternative fertilisers, such as furnace ash, different types of sludges and human urine, in cultivation...|$|R
5000|$|Isidro Medrano Garcia {{was found}} guilty on March 4, 2016 of three felony counts of lewd acts on a minor. He was sentenced to four years, four months behind bars and will be {{required}} to register as a sex offender for life. The victim testified that Garcia kidnapped her in 2004, took her to a home in Compton, provided her with a false identity and held her against her will for a decade. Between August 2004 and April 2014, she said Garcia [...] "controlled" [...] her by saying her family did not want her and were not looking for her, and that if she reported him to police she would get in trouble for using a false ID. The teen did not speak English and had come to the U.S. from Mexico illegally, according to Santa Ana Police Department. When she tried to escape, she was caught and beaten, the Police Department said. [...] "Even with the opportunity to escape, after years of physical and mental abuse, the victim saw no way out of her situation and lived a life with Garcia under sustained physical and mental abuse", a police news release stated in May 2014. The victim became pregnant with his child in 2010, according to the Orange County District Attorney. Police had before said she had the child in 2012. During her captivity, she said he got her a job where he worked and did not let her out of his sight, the District Attorney stated. That job was at a nighttime cleaning service, according to police. The decade-long ordeal first began in February 2004 when Garcia and the victim met while he lived with her and her mother, the District Attorney stated. He then [...] "groomed" [...] the then-15-year-old by buying her gifts and siding with her during arguments with her mother. That <b>summer</b> he forcibly <b>raped</b> her at least once, sexually assaulted her three times, touched her buttocks and kissed her, the victim testified. Santa Ana police first responded to a mutual domestic violence incident between Garcia and the victim’s mother in August 2004, shortly before her disappearance, [...] "but a case could not be proven at that time", the District Attorney stated. The mother identified Garcia as her boyfriend and had told a neighbor prior to the alleged abduction that she believed they were having sex and planned on leaving together, the Los Angeles Times reported.|$|R
