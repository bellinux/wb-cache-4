5|$|The 2011 final faced {{scheduling}} {{problems and}} the match clashed with top flight League fixtures {{for the first time}} since 1934, which disappointed football traditionalists. The 2011 UEFA Champions League Final was being hosted at Wembley on 28 May 2011 and UEFA rules <b>stipulate</b> <b>that</b> the host stadium for the final must not have a fixture played two weeks prior to the final. Therefore, the FA Cup final had to be moved forward, and {{for the first time since}} 1989 was played before the English football domestic season ended.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Depression Twelve formed {{over the}} southeastern Bahamas at 2100UTC on August23, {{partially}} from {{the remains of}} Tropical Depression Ten. While the normal standards for numbering tropical depressions in the Atlantic <b>stipulate</b> <b>that</b> the initial designation be retained when a depression regenerates, satellite imagery indicated that a second tropical wave had combined with Tropical Depression Ten north of Puerto Rico to form a new, more complex weather system, which was then designated as Tropical Depression Twelve. In post-season reanalysis, {{it was found that}} the low-level circulation of Tropical Depression Ten had completely detached and dissipated; only the remnant mid-level circulation moved on and merged with the second tropical wave. As a result, the criteria for keeping the same name and identity were not met. Tropical Depression Twelve later became Hurricane Katrina.|$|E
5|$|Lotus Temple, is a Bahá'í House of Worship {{completed}} in 1986. Notable for its flowerlike shape, {{it serves as}} the Mother Temple of the Indian subcontinent {{and has become a}} prominent attraction in the city. The Lotus Temple has won numerous architectural awards and been featured in hundreds of newspaper and magazine articles. Like all other Bahá'í Houses of Worship, is open to all regardless of religion, or any other distinction, as emphasised in Bahá'í texts. The Bahá'í laws emphasise that the spirit of the House of Worship be that it is a gathering place where people of all religions may worship God without denominational restrictions. The Bahá'í laws also <b>stipulate</b> <b>that</b> only the holy scriptures of the Bahá'í Faith and other religions can be read or chanted inside in any language; while readings and prayers can be set to music by choirs, no musical instruments can be played inside. Furthermore, no sermons can be delivered, and there can be no ritualistic ceremonies practised.|$|E

Civil death was a penalty in Belgium in the Ancien Régime.|$|R
5|$|Opponents of the FairTax {{argue that}} {{imposing}} a national retail sales tax would drive transactions underground {{and create a}} vast underground economy. Under a retail sales tax system, the purchase of intermediate goods and services that are factors of production are not taxed, since those goods would produce a final retail good that would be taxed. Individuals and businesses {{may be able to}} manipulate the tax system by claiming that purchases are for intermediate goods, when in fact they are final purchases that should be taxed. Proponents point out that a business is required to have a registered seller's certificate on file, and must keep complete records of all transactions for six years. Businesses must also record all taxable goods bought for seven years. They are required to report these sales every month (see Personal vs. business purchases). The government could also <b>stipulate</b> <b>that</b> all retail sellers provide buyers with a written receipt, regardless of transaction type (cash, credit, etc.), which would create a paper trail for evasion with risk of having the buyer turn them in (the FairTax authorizes a reward for reporting tax cheats).|$|E
5|$|Wear of the {{insignia}} is {{according to}} guidelines {{issued by the}} Chancellery of Honours, which <b>stipulate</b> <b>that</b> the badges be worn before most other national orders—that is, {{at the end of}} an individual's medal bar closest to the centre of the chest or at the wearer's neck—with only the Victoria Cross, the Cross of Valour, and the badge of the Order of Merit permitted to be worn before the badges of the Order of Canada. Those in the grades of Companion or Officer may wear their badges on a neck ribbon, while those in the Member group display their insignia suspended by a ribbon from a medal bar on the left chest. Protocol originally followed the British tradition, wherein female appointees wore their Order of Canada emblem on a ribbon bow positioned on the left shoulder. These regulations were altered in 1997, and women may wear their insignia in either the traditional manner or in the same fashion as the men.|$|E
5|$|The retrial {{was delayed}} {{for one day}} to give the {{defendants}} more time to prepare. The new jury selection was marked by attempts by Williams to be relieved of her duties, owing to disagreements with Shakur {{as well as with}} Hilton's attorney. Judge Arnold Bauman denied the application, but directed another lawyer, Howard Jacobs, to defend Shakur while Williams remained the attorney of record. Shakur was ejected following an argument with Williams, and Hilton left with her as jury selection continued. After the selection of twelve jurors (60 were excused), Williams was allowed to retire from the case, with Shakur officially representing herself, assisted by lawyer Florynce Kennedy. In the retrial, White testified that the six alleged robbers had saved their hair clippings to create disguises, and identified a partially obscured head and shoulder in a photo taken from a surveillance camera as Shakur's. Kennedy objected to this identification {{on the grounds that the}} prosecutor, assistant United States attorney Peter Truebner, had offered to <b>stipulate</b> <b>that</b> Shakur was not depicted in any of the photographs. Although both White and Rivers testified that Shakur was wearing overalls during the robbery, the person identified as Shakur in the photograph was wearing a jacket. The defense attempted to discredit White on the grounds that he had spent eight months in Matteawan Hospital for the Criminally Insane in 1968, and White countered that he had faked insanity (by claiming to be Allah in front of three psychiatrists) to get transferred out of prison.|$|E
50|$|Article 30 <b>stipulates</b> <b>that</b> {{the use of}} the {{languages}} spoken in Belgium is free.

Article 31 of the Constitution determines that no prior authorisation is required to prosecute civil servants for acts of their administration. Article 32 <b>stipulates</b> <b>that</b> everyone has the right to consult any administrative document and to obtain a copy thereof, except as provided by law or decree.|$|R

25|$|Among {{the ancient}} Middle Eastern Akkadian people, a salzikrum {{was a person}} who {{appeared}} biologically female but had distinct male traits. Salzikrum is a compound word meaning male daughter. According to the Code of Hammurabi, salzikrūm had inheritance rights like that of priestesses; they inherited from their fathers, unlike regular daughters. A salzikrum's father could also <b>stipulate</b> <b>that</b> she inherit a certain amount.|$|E
25|$|The asset flow {{equations}} <b>stipulate</b> <b>that</b> {{price trend}} {{is a factor}} in the supply and demand for an asset that is a key ingredient in the formation of a bubble. While many studies of market data have shown a rather minimal trend effect, the work of Caginalp and DeSantis on large scale data adjusts for changes in valuation, thereby illuminating a strong role for trend, and providing the empirical justification for the modeling.|$|E

25|$|Though {{the silver}} coins are the payment to the Kohen under torah law and {{are one of}} the twenty-four kohanic gifts, they are {{sometimes}} returned by the Kohen to the family as a gift for the child, although halachic authorities <b>stipulate</b> <b>that</b> -for the Pidyon to be valid- the choice of returning the coins as a gift rest entirely upon the Kohen whereas pressuring the kohen to do so would render the redemption invalid.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, the {{university}} set out plans {{to create a}} campus for 5,000 additional students, and to introduce {{a number of new}} subjects such as Law and Dentistry.

The City of York planning conditions <b>stipulate</b> <b>that</b> only 20% of the land area may be built upon, and the original campus was at full capacity.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the film}} has a similar look to von Trier's earlier Dogme 95-influenced films: it is filmed on low-end, {{hand-held}} digital cameras to create a documentary-style appearance. It is not a true Dogme 95 film, however, because the Dogme rules <b>stipulate</b> <b>that</b> violence, non-diegetic music, and period pieces are not permitted. Trier differentiates the musical sequences from the rest {{of the film}} by using static cameras and by brightening the colours.|$|E

25|$|In {{the study}} of perception, Gestalt psychologists <b>stipulate</b> <b>that</b> {{perceptions}} are the products of complex interactions among various stimuli. Contrary to the behaviorist approach to focusing on stimulus and response, gestalt psychologists sought to understand the organization of cognitive processes (Carlson and Heth, 2010). The gestalt effect is the capability of our brain to generate whole forms, {{particularly with respect to}} the visual recognition of global figures instead of just collections of simpler and unrelated elements (points, lines, curves, etc.).|$|E

25|$|The town of Skopelos was honoured as a Traditional Settlement of Outstanding Beauty (19/10/1978 Presidential Decree 594,13-11/78, {{signed by}} President of Greece Konstantinos Tsatsos). This is the Greek {{equivalent}} of a site of Outstanding Architectural Inheritance. The building code for new construction and renovation within the village reflects some restrictions due to the Traditional Settlement decree. Some restrictions <b>stipulate</b> <b>that</b> no new buildings shall be {{of more than two}} stories, there must be a sloped cermamic or stone roof in the traditional style, and doors, windows and balconies be made of wood.|$|E
25|$|The {{demolition}} of buildings containing {{large amounts of}} asbestos based materials pose particular problems for builders and property developers – such buildings often have to be deconstructed piece by piece, or the asbestos has to be painstakingly removed before the structure can be razed by mechanical or explosive means. One such example is the Red Road Flats in Glasgow, Scotland which used huge amounts of asbestos cement board for wall panelling – here British health and safety regulations <b>stipulate</b> <b>that</b> asbestos material has to be removed to a landfill site via an approved route at certain {{times of the day}} in specially adapted vehicles.|$|E
