25|$|Chad's eschatological {{consciousness}} {{and its effect}} on others is brought to life in a reminiscence attributed to Trumbert, who was one of his students at Lastingham. Chad used to break off reading whenever a gale sprang up and call on God to have pity on humanity. If the storm intensified, he would <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> book altogether and prostrate himself in prayer. During prolonged storms or thunderstorms he would go into the church itself to pray and sing psalms until calm returned. His monks obviously regarded this as an extreme reaction even to English weather and asked him to explain. Chad explained that storms are sent by God to remind humans of the day of judgement and to humble their pride. The typically Celtic Christian involvement with nature was not like the modern romantic preoccupation but a determination to read in it the mind of God, particularly in relation to the last things.|$|E
500|$|Much nearer was , {{which had}} warned Titanic of ice {{a few hours}} earlier. Apprehensive at his ship being caught in a large field of drift ice, [...] Californians captain, Stanley Lord, had decided at about 22:00 to halt for the night and wait for {{daylight}} {{to find a way}} through the ice field. At 23:30, 10minutes before Titanic hit the iceberg, Californians sole radio operator, Cyril Evans, <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> set down for the night and went to bed. On the bridge her Third Officer, Charles Groves, saw a large vessel to starboard around [...] away. It made a sudden turn to port and stopped. If the radio operator of Californian had stayed at his post fifteen minutes longer, hundreds of lives might have been saved. A little over an hour later, Second Officer Herbert Stone saw five white rockets exploding above the stopped ship. Unsure what the rockets meant, he called Captain Lord, who was resting in the chartroom, and reported the sighting. Lord did not act on the report, but Stone was perturbed: [...] "A ship is not going to fire rockets at sea for nothing," [...] he told a colleague.|$|E
500|$|The Middlesex coroner, Wynne Baxter, {{believed}} that Stride {{had been attacked}} with a swift, sudden action. She was still holding a packet of cachous (breath freshening sweets) in her left hand when she was discovered, indicating {{that she had not}} had time to defend herself. A grocer, Matthew Packer, implied to private detectives employed by the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee that he had sold some grapes to Stride and the murderer; however, he had told police that he had <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> shop without seeing anything suspicious. At the inquest, the pathologists stated emphatically that Stride had not held, swallowed or consumed grapes. They described her stomach contents as [...] "cheese, potatoes and farinaceous powder [...] ". Nevertheless, Packer's story appeared in the press. Packer's description of the man did not match the statements by other witnesses who may have seen Stride with a man shortly before her murder, but all but two of the descriptions differed. Joseph Lawende passed through Mitre Square with two other men shortly before Eddowes was murdered there, and may have seen her with a man of about 30 years old, who was shabbily dressed, wore a peaked cap, and had a fair moustache. Chief Inspector Swanson noted that Lawende's description was a near match to another provided by one of the witnesses who may have seen Stride with her murderer. However, Lawende stated {{that he would not be}} able to identify the man again, and the two other men with Lawende were unable to give descriptions.|$|E

500|$|The {{extent to}} which money or {{patronage}} affected {{the outcome of the}} election is unclear. Congressman Burton stated, [...] "I never saw any evidence of the use of money in Columbus and don't believe that any money was used corruptly." [...] In an interview after Hanna's death, James Rudolph Garfield, son of the late president and floor leader of the Hanna forces in the Ohio Senate, recalled that the senator [...] "had been asked to <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> eyes to some things. But he declined to do it." [...] However, Garfield also noted, [...] "I have never been sure as to what some of the men who called themselves Senator Hanna's friends really did do." [...] Croly believed that Hanna did not personally authorize bribes of legislators, but concedes that Hanna's supporters [...] "may have been willing to spend money in Mr. Hanna's interest and without his knowledge." [...] The biographer suggested, [...] "If Mr. Hanna had himself planned to purchase the vote of John C. Otis, it is reasonable to believe that the business would have been better managed." [...] Horner believes it impossible to ascertain if corruption took place, but if Hanna bribed legislators, it was because it was a common practice on both sides. He notes of Hanna, [...] "his career as a senator continued, but accusations of wrongdoing remain a part of his legacy well over a century later." [...] Public dismay at what was seen as a corrupt means of choosing federal lawmakers was {{a major factor in the}} ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1913, which took the privilege of electing senators out of state legislators' hands and gave it to the people.|$|E

Vieira, however, later suggested that, having walked out on his national team in the FIFA World Cup finals, Keane {{was not in a}} good position to comment on such matters. Referee Poll later revealed that he should have sent off both players before the match had begun, though was under pressure not to do so.|$|E

In June 1766, Johnson was on his knees before John Delap, a clergyman, [...] "beseeching God to continue to him {{the use of his}} understanding" [...] in a [...] "wild" [...] manner that provoked Johnson's friend, Henry Thrale to [...] "involuntarily [...] up one hand to <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> mouth". The Thrales were afraid for his mental health, and took Johnson into their home in Streatham for a few months, in the hope that might aid his recovery.

2500|$|The {{decision}} {{of a public}} authority may be challenged if the authority has fettered the exercise of its discretion by adhering too rigidly to a policy it has designed to structure its discretion. It is legitimate for public authorities to formulate policies that are [...] "legally relevant to the exercise of their powers, consistent {{with the purpose of}} the enabling legislation, and not arbitrary, capricious or unjust". However, authorities must remain free to depart from their policies depending on the case at hand. It is a general rule that [...] "anyone who has to exercise a statutory discretion must not <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> ears to an application", and that an authority must always be willing to listen to anyone with something new to say.|$|E

2500|$|On the {{television}} show Roger Ebert & the Movies, director Martin Scorsese named Eyes Wide <b>Shut</b> <b>his</b> fourth-favorite film of the 1990s. For the introduction to Michel Ciment's Kubrick: The Definitive Edition, Scorsese wrote: [...] "When Eyes Wide Shut came out {{a few months after}} Stanley Kubrick's death in 1999, it was severely misunderstood, which came as no surprise. If you {{go back and look at}} the contemporary reactions to any Kubrick picture (except the earliest ones), you'll see that all his films were initially misunderstood. Then, after five or ten years came the realization that [...] or Barry Lyndon or The Shining was like nothing else before or since." [...] Mystery writer and commentator Jon Breen agreed. In 2012, Slant Magazine ranked the film as the second greatest of the 1990s. The BBC listed it number 61 in its list of the 100 greatest American films of all time.|$|E
2500|$|In 1816, {{with the}} {{experiences}} of the war before him, no well-informed statesman could <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> eyes to the national aspects of the problem. Even President Madison invited the attention of Congress to the need of establishing [...] "a comprehensive system of roads and canals". Soon after Congress met, it took under consideration a bill drafted by Calhoun which proposed an appropriation of $1,500,000 ($ in [...] consumer dollars) for internal improvements. Because this appropriation was to be met by the moneys paid by the National Bank to the government, the bill was commonly referred to as the [...] "Bonus Bill". But on the day before he left office, President Madison vetoed the bill because it was unconstitutional. The policy of internal improvements by federal aid was thus wrecked on the constitutional scruples of the last of the Virginia dynasty. Having less regard for consistency, the House of Representatives recorded its conviction, by close votes, that Congress could appropriate money to construct roads and canals, but had not the power to construct them. As yet the only direct aid of the national government to internal improvements consisted of various appropriations, amounting to about $1,500,000 for the Cumberland Road.|$|E

[...] He added: [...] "The whole event was misunderstood. People took Captain Midnight to be a symbol of frustration people were feeling about scrambling. It made him seem a representative of dish owners, but he was not. There was no way a dish owner could do what he did." [...] A group called the Captain Midnight Grassroots Cause was formed, and sold merchandise to help raise money for MacDougall to pay his legal fees. MacDougall found the constant media attention difficult to deal with, and was regularly bothered at home. MacDougall <b>shut</b> <b>his</b> office because no work could be undertaken without him being asked about Captain Midnight. , he still resides in Ocala and undertakes consulting work. In a retrospective interview with Network World in 2011, MacDougall said he did not regret his actions but wished his motivations were more clearly understood: ...|$|E
