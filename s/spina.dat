40|$|A green Chlorobium sp. with <b>spinae,</b> strain JSB 1, was {{isolated}} from an enrichment culture previously obtained from Fayetteville Green Lake, N. Y. (J. S. Brooke, J. B. Thompson, T. J. Beveridge, and S. F. Koval, Arch. Microbiol. 157 : 319 - 322, 1992). Cells were gram-negative, nonmotile rods which contained bacteriochlorophyll c and chlorosomes. <b>Spinae</b> were best seen by {{transmission electron microscopy}} in thin sections of cells fixed {{in the presence of}} tannic acid. High-resolution scanning electron microscopy showed the <b>spinae</b> randomly distributed at the cell surface and at the junctions between cells. <b>Spinae</b> were physically sheared from cells and isolated from the culture supernatant by ultrafiltration. As observed by electron microscopy, <b>spinae</b> demonstrated unusual structural stability when exposed for 1 h at 37 deg C to chemical treatments such as hydrogen bond-breaking agents, detergents, metal-chelating agents, proteases, and organic solvents. They were stable for 1 h at 37 deg C over the pH range 2. 3 to 9. 9 and in 1 M HCl and 1 M NaOH. The structural integrity of the <b>spinae</b> was also maintained when <b>spinae</b> were subjected to harsher treatments of autoclaving in 2 % (wt/vol) sodium dodecyl sulfate and exposure to dithiothreitol at pH 9 for 1 h at 100 deg C. Partially dissociated <b>spinae</b> were obtained after 5 h at 100 deg C in 1 M HCl and 1 M NaOH. In acid, the tubular <b>spinae</b> became amorphous structures, with no helical striations visible. In alkali, the <b>spinae</b> had dissociated into irregular aggregates of disks. Since both high temperature and extremes of pH were required to achieve partial dissociation of the <b>spinae,</b> the strength of the structure presumably comes from covalent bonding...|$|R

Nineteen male subjects lifted three loads from two origin locations to an upright neutral posture. Spinal loading was predicted from an EMG-assisted biomechanical model that allowed the erector <b>spinae</b> moment arm to vary during torso flexion. The predicted lateral, anterior-posterior shear and compression forces increased by 7. 4 %, 11. 1 % and 6. 6 %, respectively, when compared to using a biomechanical model that kept the erector <b>spinae</b> moment arm constant.

The activities of {{the internal and external}} abdominal oblique, rectus abdominal,multifidus and thoracic and lumbar erector <b>spinae</b> muscles were measured using surface electromyography. Unexpected and expected perturbations were applied to the trunk by sudden loading. The subject was instructed to maintain his initial standing position. The results showed that the activation of the multifidus and lumbar and thoracic erector <b>spinae</b> muscles was increased significantly more in the expected condition than in the unexpected condition in anticipation of postural adjustment. The activation of the multifidus and lumbar erector <b>spinae</b> muscles was increased significantly more than 150 msec before the perturbations,while that of the thoracic erector <b>spinae</b> muscles was increased significantly, 50 msec before the perturbations. The increased activation of the multifidus and lumbar erector <b>spinae</b> muscles appears to be a mechanism designed to improve the stability of the trunk through stiffening of the entire segment during forward loading...|$|R

5|$|The Hippodrome in Constantinople {{remained}} in use for races, games, and public ceremonies {{up to the}} sack of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204. In the 12th century, Emperor Manuel I Komnenos (r. 1143–1180) even staged Western-style jousting matches in the Hippodrome. During the sack of 1204, the Crusaders looted the city and, among other things, removed the copper quadriga that stood above the carceres; it is now displayed at St. Mark's Cathedral in Venice. Thereafter, the Hippodrome was neglected, although still occasionally used for spectacles. A print of the Hippodrome from the fifteenth century shows a derelict site, a few walls still standing, and the <b>spina,</b> the central reservation, robbed of its splendor.

5|$|The bones show {{a variety}} of {{diseases}} and degenerative processes. Six skeletons showed evidence of Paget's disease of bone (osteitis deformans). The most severe case of Paget's disease was in a body buried in the nave in a stone coffin. The lid was carved with two shields, indicating that the occupant had been a knight. One skeleton showed signs of leprosy affecting bones in the face, hands and feet. No definite cases of tuberculosis directly affecting bones were found but in two individuals there were changes in the ribs consistent with their having suffered from tuberculosis of the lungs. The only major congenital abnormality found consisted of bony changes resulting from a possible case of Down's syndrome. Relatively minor congenital abnormalities of the spine were found in 19skeletons, ten of which were cases of <b>spina</b> bifida occulta. Other spinal abnormalities included fused vertebrae, spondylolysis and transitional vertebrae. Definite evidence of fractured bones was found in ten skeletons, and evidence of possible fractures was found in three other cases. One cranium contained a large circular lesion {{which may have been}} the consequence of trepanning. Other diseases specific to bones and joints were osteoarthritis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), and possible cases of spondyloarthropathy. Three skeletons showed possible evidence of rickets, two had changes of osteoporosis, and three crania had features of hyperostosis frontalis interna, a metabolic condition affecting post-menopausal women. Osteomata (benign tumours of bone) were found in three cases.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction: The low {{resistance}} of the erector <b>spinae</b> {{has been seen as}} a risk factor for developing chronic low back pain. The test of the erector <b>spinae</b> muscle endurance advocated by Biering-Sorensen has been used to assess the strength of the erector <b>spinae</b> muscle. Modifications of the measuring instrument require reliability studies. Objective: To evaluate the measurement of the erector <b>spinae</b> muscle endurance and the standard error of measurement (SEM) of the modified Biering-Sorensen test of erector <b>spinae</b> in women with chronic low back pain. Methods: Forty-eight sedentary women, aged 52 ± 7, suffering from chronic low back pain, were tested. The position adopted was the prone position without the trunk on the examining table. Fixations were performed with straps at the ankles, knees and pelvis. The patient was instructed to maintain the shoulder blades in contact with the stadiometer as long as possible. The measurement was repeated, with measures 15 minutes apart. Results: Considering the confidence limits of Bland & Altman, - 40 and 68 seconds, the SEM was 13 seconds and SEM% was 22. The ICC = 0. 87 with p = 0. 001. The first test was equal to 54 ± 36 seconds, and the retest = 67 ± 40 seconds. Conclusion: The endurance test of the erector <b>spinae</b> showed moderate reliability. Therefore, we suggest that, despite its applicability in clinical practice, the results should be interpreted carefully because the differences in mean erector <b>spinae</b> endurance of up to 13 seconds may be related to measurement error...|$|R

25|$|<b>Spina</b> bifida is a {{birth defect}} {{where there is}} {{incomplete}} closing of the backbone and membranes around the spinal cord. There are three main types: <b>spina</b> bifida occulta, meningocele, and myelomeningocele. The most common location is the lower back, but in rare cases {{it may be the}} middle back or neck. Occulta has no or only mild signs. Signs of occulta may include a hairy patch, dimple, dark spot, or swelling on the back {{at the site of the}} gap in the spine. Meningocele typically causes mild problems with a sac of fluid present at the gap in the spine. Myelomeningocele, also known as open <b>spina</b> bifida, is the most severe form. Associated problems include poor ability to walk, problems with bladder or bowel control, hydrocephalus, a tethered spinal cord, and latex allergy. Learning problems are relatively uncommon.|$|E
