[...] Until the early 1990s, police cars in Colombia were equipped with flashing yellow lights.

The painting is illuminated by a soft chiaroscuro inspired by the Brescia masters of the 16th century and characteristic of the early phase of Caravaggio's development. The catalogue to the 1990 exhibition held to mark {{the identification of the}} Wildenstein Lute Player - which was already known but thought to be a copy by another hand - commented on the markedly different lighting used for this version, claiming that it [...] "marks a significant step toward the more dramatically lit, highly focused style of Caravaggio's maturity" [...] - i.e., towards the heightened contrast between shadows and light (tenebrism) that would mark paintings such as The Martyrdom of Saint Matthew. Nevertheless, critic Jason Kaufman felt that the rendition of the boy in the Wildenstein version was aesthetically inferior to the Hermitage, [...] "...the face...hard and the expression less sweet than bovine...the features...more sharply defined, the eyebrows severely geometrized, and the complexion pink, rather than fleshtone, [...] " [...] and David Van Edwards, noting apparent mistakes in the depiction of the lute in the Wildenstein version, the <b>secondary</b> <b>light</b> <b>source</b> and the inconsistent perspectives of table and sitter, concluded that the painting is not by Caravaggio.|$|E

Possible effects of different implementations of the <b>secondary</b> <b>light</b> <b>source</b> (high-intensity discharge and incandescent) were also briefly discussed. Based on the available evidence concerning the quality of driver performance (excluding startle effects), a delay of 100 ms or less is unlikely to create safety problems.

40|$|Most {{theories}} of colour constancy assume a flat coloured surface {{and a single}} homogenous <b>light</b> <b>source.</b> Natural situations, however, are 3 -dimensional (3 -D), are hardly ever restricted to a single <b>light</b> <b>source,</b> and object illumination is never homogenous.

Subjects made `paper'-matches between colour patches in light and shadow and between patches under the transparency and without the transparency. Matching did not depend on whether the simulated lighting condition was natural (yellow light, blue shadow) or artificial (green light, magenta shadow). Patches under a coloured transparency produced lightness constancy but subjects could not discount chromaticity shifts induced by the transparency. The number of context patches (2 vs 6) made no difference, and {{it made no difference}} whether the transparency covered the Mondrian completely or only partially.

Under monochromatic illumination, QE at the energies EH and EL is 10 – 4 and 10 – 8, respectively.

40|$|Global {{illumination}} adds tremendous visual richness to rendered images. Unfortunately, such illumination proves quite {{costly to}} compute, {{and is therefore}} often coarsely approximated by interactive applications, or simply omitted altogether. Global illumination is often quite low-frequency, aside from sharp changes at discontinuities. This thesis describes three novel multiresolution image-space methods that exploit this characteristic to accelerate rendering speeds. These techniques run completely on the GPU at interactive rates and require no precomputation, allowing fully dynamic lighting, geometry, and camera. The first approach, multiresolution splatting, is a novel multiresolution method for rendering indirect illumination. This work extends reflective shadow maps, an image space method that splats contributions from <b>secondary</b> <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> into eye-space. Splats are refined into multiresolution patches, rendering indirect contributions at low resolution where lighting changes slowly and at high resolution near discontinuities; this greatly reduces GPU fill rate and enhances performance. The second method, image space radiosity, significantly improves the performance of multiresolution splatting, introducing an efficient stencil-based parallel refinement technique. This method also adapts ideas from object-space hierarchical radiosity methods to image space, introducing two adaptive sampling methods that allow much finer sampling of the reflective shadow map where needed. These modifications significantly improve temporal coherence while maintaining performance. The third approach adapts these techniques to accelerate the rendering of direct illumination from large area <b>light</b> <b>sources.</b> Visibility is computed using a coarse screen-space voxelization technique, allowing binary visibility queries using ray marching. This work also proposes a new incremental refinement method that considers both illumination and visibility variations. Both diffuse and non-diffuse surfaces are supported, and illumination can vary {{over the surface of}} the light, enabling dynamic content such as video screens...|$|R

While the study can be generalized to any material, we focus here on a simple layered medium composed of a conjugated polymers (CPs) thin film, a zinc oxide layer (ZnO) and a sapphire substrate. The study spreads throughout variable aspects including the effect of the structure parameters on the CP luminescence and radiation pattern and more specifically the influence of the absorption and emission properties of the active layer. Comparing between the passive and active layer cases, the obtained results show that an enhancement of the CP luminescence of more than 20 times can be obtained by using an optically active underlying layer. The results can be explained in terms of photon recycling where the optically active layer acts as a photon reservoir and a <b>secondary</b> <b>light</b> <b>source</b> for the ultra thin film.

In this paper, each sphere also acts as a low-frequency <b>secondary</b> <b>light</b> <b>source,</b> thereby providing diffuse one-bounce indirect illumination. The method is completely dynamic and proceeds in two passes: In a first pass, the light intensity distribution on each sphere is updated based on sample points on the corresponding object surface and converted into the spherical harmonics basis. In a second pass, this radiance information and the visibility is accumulated to shade final image pixels. The sphere approximation allows us to compute visibility and diffuse reflections of an object at interactive frame rates of over 20 fps for moderately complex scenes.

We further demonstrate that the same hole traps can be found in various MBE-grown Ga(In) NP alloys, regardless of their growth temperatures, chemical compositions, and strain. The extent of the PL enhancement induced by the hole de-trapping is shown to vary between different alloys, however, likely reflecting their different trap concentrations. The absence of theses traps in the GaNP alloy grown by vapor phase epitaxy suggests that their incorporation could be associated with a contaminant accompanied by the N plasma source employed in the MBEgrowth, possibly a Cu impurity...|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{progressive}} refinement algorithm that generates an approximate image quickly, then gradually refines it towards the final result. Our algorithm can reconstruct a high-quality image after evaluating {{only a small}} percentage of the pixels. For a typical scene, evaluating only 6 % of the pixels yields an approximate image that is visually hard to distinguish from an image with all the pixels evaluated. At this low sampling rate, previous techniques such as adaptive stochastic sampling suffer from artifacts including heavily jagged edges, missing object parts, and missing high-frequency details. A key ingredient of our algorithm is the directional coherence map (DCM), a new technique for handling general radiance discontinuities in a progressive ray tracing framework. Essentially an encoding of the directional coherence in image space, the DCM performs well on discontinuities that are usually considered extremely difficult, e. g. those involving non-polygonal geometry or caused by <b>secondary</b> <b>light</b> <b>sources.</b> Incorporating the DCM into a ray tracing system incurs only a negligible amount of additional computation. More importantly, the DCM uses little memory and thus it preserves the strengths of ray tracing systems in dealing with complex scenes. We have implemented our algorithm on top of RADIANCE. Our enhanced system can produce high-quality images significantly faster than RADIANCE – sometimes by orders of magnitude. Moreover, when the baseline system becomes less effective as its Monte Carlo components are challenged by difficult lighting configurations, our system will still produce high quality images by redistributing computation to the small percentage of pixels as dictated by the DCM...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{identify}} new methods of improving the delivery and assessment of minimally invasive surgery (MIS), particularly under the constraint of monoscopic MIS visualisation. In this thesis, the role of visual spatial ability in the acquisition of surgical skills is first investigated. A psychometric test is used to elucidate the correlation between spatial ability and complex tasks, and highlight {{the need for more}} quantitative assessment of visuomotor behaviours in laparoscopic procedures. To this end, a wavelet-based analysis framework for instrument trajectory analysis is developed for extracting intrinsic motion behaviours. This is used to provide an insight into subconscious integration of the visual and motor axes in a depthless operative field. The issue of monoscopic visualisation of the operative field in MIS is also addressed and a method of improving depth perception by digitally enhancing a "weak" shadow cast by a <b>secondary</b> <b>light</b> <b>source</b> is proposed. By performing experiments on MIS novices, significant improvements in depth perception by the use of the proposed technique are demonstrated. Finally, eye tracking is used to study the difference in visual behaviour between laparoscopic novices and experts. A distinct visual behaviour of instrument tool-tip tracking during instrument manoeuvring is observed among the novices but not the experts, and this behaviour is shown to be repeatable in both groups. These results provide an important insight into how the cognitive, motor and visual stimuli are integrated during MIS surgery, as well as how the surgeons compensate for the depthless operative field. These findings can be used for the development of more focussed training curricula and the development of improved MIS instruments for its safe practice.

40|$|An {{interesting}} concept {{related to}} photovoltaic energy is Concentrated Photovoltaics (CPV), in which sunlight is focussed on a PV cell through lenses and mirrors, thereby increasing the incident irradiance on the PV cell. Solar concentration {{is proven to}} not only increase the output power of PV cells, but also to increase the electrical efficiency of PV cells. This concept is expected to further push PV energy to the scale of MW power plants for large-scale energy production, and increase the power density of standalone PV modules on Earth and in space. Increasing the irradiation on a PV cell inevitably also increases {{the temperature of the}} PV cell due to thermal losses. Cell temperature has a negative effect on the output power and electrical efficiency of a PV cell, and given a high enough concentration ratio, may cause the PV cell to lose electrical efficiency and ultimately break down. Adequate cooling is therefore required for CPV systems to keep the PV cell in its optimal operating temperature range. For this purpose a model is proposed that simulates the output characteristics under influence of solar concentration and temperature variations, most notably the output power and electrical efficiency of a PV cell. The electro-thermal model is fundamentally based on the detailed balance model, which dictates that the absorbed and emitted photon flux must be equal in equilibrium conditions. From detailed balance, the absorption, recombination and photo-generation processes in a PV cell are determined, from which the Shockley-Queisser limit is deduced. This fundamental model is extended to the single-diode model, which serves as the ultimate baseline of PV simulation, taking into account cell temperature, concentration ratio and other internal PV cell factors. Sensitivity analyses on the single-diode model show that solar concentration indeed increases the output power and electrical efficiency. Taking into account solar concentration and temperature effects however, shows that the electrical efficiency drops by 4 % points at a concentration ratio of 20, thereby confirming that without cooling, increasing the solar concentration on a PV cell will yield lower electrical efficiencies due to thermal effects. Laboratory experiments are conducted on an Emcore 3 J gallium-arsenide PV cell (DUT) to verify the electro-thermal model. Baseline tests are conducted using a calibrated light source, and secondary tests involving a <b>secondary</b> <b>light</b> <b>source</b> are performed at controlled ambient and elevated temperatures. These results show that the model has a fit of 98. 9 % with respect to the verified specifications of the DUT PV cell at an ambient temperature of 25 ◦C. At an elevated cell temperature of 60 ◦C, discrepancies exist between the simulated single-diode model and test results. A new in-plane heat conduction concept developed by Airbus NL called Hiper is added to the test set-up to assess its suitability in conjunction with a heat radiator for PV cells. Hiper is a novel thin-film material particularly suited to spread heat effectively over a surface, from which it can be dissipated using a radiating material. Experimental results show that heat is spread slightly more effectively with Hiper, than in the same test set-up without Hiper, highlighting its heat spreading capabilities.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the application of}} tilting-filter photometry {{to the study of}} the airglow and aurora. Previous South African photometric research is reviewed. Optical instrumentation and techniques used in airglow and auroral research are reviewed. The transmission characteristics of narrowband interference filters are discussed. The analogue meridian-scanning tilting-filter photometry system used at Sanae, Antarctica is described. Shortcomings of this system have been identified, and modifications have been made to improve its spatial and temporal resolution. Details are given of the computer-controlled digital photometry system which replaced the analogue system. Equations are derived for the conversion of raw photometric data (analogue chart deflections or digital photon counts) to absolute emission intensities. The accuracy of the intensities obtained depends on the absolute calibration of the photometer, the transmission characteristics of the filter used to isolate the spectral feature of interest, and the effects of atmospheric extinction and scattering. The influence of these factors on observed emission intensities is discussed. Various models used to determine atmospheric correction factors are reviewed. It is shown that atmospheric correction factors can have a significant effect on both emission intensities and intensity ratios. The procedure used to determine the transmission characteristics of interference filters is described, as is the procedure used to cross-calibrate <b>secondary</b> <b>light</b> <b>sources.</b> The transmission characteristics of the filters and the brightnesses of the <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> were both found to have changed appreciably with age. The observation of a magnetospheric substorm at Sanae (L ≃ 4) is used to illustrate the use of a meridian-scanning tilting-filter photometer system in auroral research. The ratio I(557. 7) / I(391. 4) observed at Sanae was found to be lower than expected, as were the OJ airglow emission intensities. A prototype digital photometer system was used aboard a ship, to observe the airglow in the region of the South Atlantic Anomaly. Significant N₂⁺ lNG emissions at 391. 4 nm were measured, confirming the presence of discernable particle precipitation in the region. The 0 I 557. 7 and 630. 0 nm intensities measured from the ship were found to be lower than expected. This, combined with low airglow and auroral intensities measured at Sanae, is a cause for concern. It is recommended that further checks be made regarding the brightness of the calibration sources. ...|$|R
40|$|Household energy {{transitions}} in low and middle-income countries {{can play an}} important and often immediate role in improving human welfare in various dimensions. Residential use of kerosene, particularly as a lighting fuel in inefficient lamps, is one such energy use with the potential for significant improvements and benefits. I present measurements and analyses investigating characteristics of kerosene use, pollutant emissions from its use for household lighting and how distal drivers affecting price and access to electricity influence household consumption. Towards informing household air pollution assessment methodologies, a comparison of markers of complex pollutant mixtures is performed in the context of residential sources of combustion in Nepal. Laboratory and field measurement showed that 7 - 9 % of kerosene consumed by widely used simple wick lamps is converted to carbonaceous particulate matter that is nearly pure black carbon. Combined with estimates of bottom-up fuel consumption from survey-based estimates of user prevalence, these high emission factors increase previous black carbon emission estimates from kerosene by 20 -fold, to 270 Gg/year (90 % uncertainty bounds: 110, 590 Gg/year). Applying consumption and lighting device stock estimates from a recent UN assessment approximately doubles the central emissions estimate. Estimated global BC emissions from kerosene <b>lighting</b> <b>sources</b> are approximately one eighth of residential biomass BC emissions and one sixth of those from diesel. As a source, the net effect of pollutant emissions from kerosene lamps on climate would be positive (warming) given the relatively small cooling effect of co-emitted pollutants. Indoor area measurements during operation of cooking and lighting appliances indicated that trends in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and elemental carbon did not always reflect trends in standard markers of pollution, suggesting that their use as supplemental markers could provide added information. The most pronounced difference was observed from area concentrations during use of the sawdust stove, where total PAH concentrations were measured to be three times greater than from the second highest PAH source, the traditional biomass-burning chulo stove, but sawdust stove PM 2. 5 concentrations were three times lower than from the chulo. Kerosene stove measurements showed average retene concentrations to be ten times higher than from the highest biomass source, adding to existing skepticism over the use of retene as a source marker of softwood combustion. From an analysis of residential kerosene use in India, lighting was found to account for over 60 % of residential kerosene consumption. The electrified household population constituted an approximately equal share of kerosene demand as the non-electrified household population. Impacts resulting from kerosene lighting activities were also substantial, providing a potential opportunity to improve population welfare while also alleviating economic burdens associated with government subsidies. Reductions in ambient primary PM 2. 5 resulting from the abatement of kerosene as a <b>lighting</b> <b>source</b> were estimated to avert between 0. 27 - 1. 6 million years of life lost in 2030. Early PM 2. 5 control costs to replace kerosene with pico-solar lighting devices were estimated to yield a net savings of $ 3. 5 billion in 2030, principally due to reductions in kerosene purchases. Kerosene demand for lighting was found to be highly price sensitive, so that in a scenario in which current subsidies are phased out by 2030, kerosene demand drops by 97 % compared to the Baseline. The economic inefficiency implied results in an estimated deadweight loss from the kerosene subsidy of $ 950 million in 2005, with over three quarters attributed to its use as a <b>secondary</b> <b>lighting</b> <b>source.</b> The most effective measures for reducing kerosene burden would be those that address use as a <b>secondary</b> <b>lighting</b> fuel...|$|R

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to approximate an area <b>light</b> <b>source</b> with a point <b>light</b> <b>source</b> for each component of the shading model. The position and intensity of the point <b>light</b> <b>source</b> {{is dependent on the}} position and orientation of scene points. Thus the scene is shaded using on-the-fly point <b>light</b> <b>sources.</b> The key contribution of our work is that we are able to shade with area <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> of arbitrary shape and arbitrary inten-sity distribution in real time and the shading model can be generic. And the computation cost is independent of the complexity of the area <b>light</b> <b>source.</b> Experimental results show that our approach cre-ates results comparable to the ground truth. Our approach could be extended to other kinds of local <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> such as curved <b>light</b> <b>sources</b> and volume <b>light</b> <b>sources...</b>|$|R

For a thin infinitely long <b>light</b> <b>source,</b> intensity is inversely proportional to distance. For a <b>light</b> <b>source</b> of infinite area, intensity does not decrease at all. Generally, a soft <b>light</b> <b>source</b> does not drop in intensity as quickly as a point <b>light</b> <b>source</b> would (as distance increases).|$|R
