She {{seems to have been}} both beautiful and intelligent, but the two did not get along well together. There appears to be absolutely no ground for the vague scandal as to her conduct, which was, for the most part, raised long afterwards by gossip or personal enemies of La Fontaine. All that can be positively said against her is that she was a negligent housewife and an inveterate novel reader; de la [...] Fontaine himself was constantly away from home, was certainly not strict in point of conjugal fidelity, and was so bad a man of business that his affairs became involved in hopeless difficulty, and a financial <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> (separation de biens) had to take place in 1658. This was a perfectly amicable transaction {{for the benefit of the}} family; by degrees, however, the pair, still without any actual quarrel, ceased to live together, and for the greater part of the last forty years of de la Fontaine's life he lived in Paris while his wife remained in Chateau Thierry which, however, he frequently visited. One son was born to them in 1653, and was educated and taken care of wholly by his mother.|$|E

A comprehensive classification of techniques for improving reliability and reducing risk, based on the method <b>of</b> <b>separation</b> has been proposed for the first time.

The concept ‘stochastic separation’ of random events and methods for providing a stochastic separation have been introduced. It is shown that <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>properties</b> is an efficient technique for compensating the drawbacks associated with a selection based on homogeneous properties.

Porous structure of GNC models is evaluated by the method proposed by Bhattacharya and Gubbins. All the studied structures are strictly microporous. Next, mechanisms of Ar adsorption are described basing on the analysis of adsorption isotherms, enthalpy plots, the values of Henry’s constants, α_{s} and adsorption potential distribution plots. It is concluded that below pore diameters ca. 0. 8 nm, primary micropore filling process dominates.

40|$|Abstract: Demonstrating {{the safety}} of a system (ie. {{avoiding}} the undesired propagation of access rights or indirect access through some other granted resource) is {{one of the goals of}} access control research, e. g. [1 - 4]. However, the flexibility required from enterprise resource management (ERP) systems may require the implementation of seemingly contradictory requirements (e. g. complex <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> duty requirements but at the same time support for discretionary delegation of business process tasks and rights). To aid in the analysis of safety problems in business processbased ERP systems, this paper presents a model-checking based approach [5]. This is done in the context of a real-world banking business process requiring static and dynamic <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> duty <b>properties</b> as well as delegation of task instances. This paper extends earlier work we have done in this area [6]. In particular, we now present a more structured analysis approach covering the inter- and intra-relationships between business process definitions and their instances. A fundamental notion is that of a business object which may be manipulated by one or several principals over multiple business process definitions and instances. This, in combination with the ability to delegate and revoke tasks, the possibly required rights, as well as maintaining dynamic <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> duty <b>properties</b> cannot be done manually any more and motivates our model-checking approach...|$|R

5000|$|Two {{other legal}} {{documents}} offer {{some insight into}} the lives of the Vernier and La Porte. [...] In December 1622, Marie Venière petitioned for and was granted <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> from her husband. In June 1624, Mathieu Lefebvre, “desirous of retiring into some private place to live there the rest of his days,” gave all his property, real and personal, to his wife in return for an annual pension of 150 livres. A petition for separation was an action available only to women and “depended legally on a husband’s failure to maintain his wife.” These petitions could also be motivated by the need to protect the household from creditors; perhaps that was the case here, since Lefebvre later donated all of his property to his wife.|$|E
50|$|Civil-law and bijuridical jurisdictions, {{including}} Quebec, Louisiana, France, South Africa, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, {{and many}} others, have statutory default matrimonial regimes, {{in addition to}} or, in some cases, in lieu of regimes {{that can only be}} contracted by prenuptial agreements. Generally, couples marry into some form of community of property by default, or instead contract out under <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> or some other regime through a prenuptial agreement passed before a Civil-law notary or other public officer solemnizing the marriage. Five countries, including the Netherlands, have signed on to the Hague Convention on the Law applicable to Matrimonial Property Regimes, which entered into force on 1 September 1992, which allows spouses to choose not only the regimes offered by their country, but also any regime in force in the country where at least one is a citizen or resident or where marital real estate is situated.|$|E
5000|$|Manus {{marriage}} was an institutionally unequal relationship. By {{the time of}} Julius Caesar, it was largely abandoned in favour of [...] "free" [...] marriage; when a wife moved into her husband's home, she remained under her father's lawful authority; {{but she did not}} conduct her daily life under his direct scrutiny. and her husband had no legal power over her. This was one of the factors in the independence Roman women enjoyed, relative to those of many other ancient cultures and up to the modern period: Free marriage usually involved two citizens of equal or near-equal status, or a citizen and a person who held Latin rights. In the later Imperial period and with official permission, soldier-citizens and non-citizens could marry.
