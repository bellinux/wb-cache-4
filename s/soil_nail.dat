25|$|Soil nailing is a {{technique}} in which soil slopes, excavations or retaining walls are reinforced by the insertion of relatively slender elements â€“ normally steel reinforcing bars. The bars are usually installed into a pre-drilled hole and then grouted into place or drilled and grouted simultaneously. They are usually installed untensioned at a slight downward inclination. A rigid or flexible facing (often sprayed concrete) or isolated <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> heads may be used at the surface.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} construction, <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> walls have a decisive {{advantage}} over other alternatives. <b>Soil</b> <b>nail</b> walls require a smaller right-of-way than ground anchor walls and have less environmental impact. Installation of <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> walls is relatively rapid and typically uses less materials and smaller construction equipment than ground anchor walls.|$|E
50|$|Initial design {{considerations}} include wall layout (wall height and length), <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> {{vertical and horizontal}} spacing, <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> pattern on wall face, <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> inclination, <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> length and distribution, <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> material and relevant ground properties. With all these variables {{in the mind of}} the design engineer the next step is to use simplified charts to preliminarily evaluate nail length and maximum nail force. Nail length, diameter and spacing typically control external and internal stability of the wall. These parameters can be adjusted during design until all external and internal stability requirements are met. After the initial design is completed, final design progresses where the <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> wall has to be tested for external and internal failure modes, seismic considerations and aesthetic qualities. Drainage, frost penetration and external loads such as wind and hydrostatic forces also have to be determined and included in the final examination of the design. <b>Soil</b> <b>nail</b> walls are not ideal in locations with highly plastic clay soils. Soils with high plasticity, a high liquid limit and low undrained shear strengths are at risk of long-term deformation (creep).|$|E
40|$|Observed {{performance}} of <b>soil</b> <b>nailed</b> walls in Korea {{based on a}} number of field measurements has been investigated.

40|$|In {{the past}} few decades, slope {{stability}} analysis using numerical methods is becoming a hot issue, but {{it is based on}} extremely ideal assumptions. <b>Soil</b> <b>nailing</b> technique, {{as one of the most}} cost-effective reinforcing methods, has already been widely used for reinforcing slopes. In this study, to evaluate the safety factor of a slope, the strains on <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> were measured by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor. Strains along <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> in the same cross section of a slope can be computed using the measured wavelength shifts of FBG sensors. In order to evaluate the stability of a slope, an optimal model was proposed to search the potential slip surfaces based on measured strain values. Maximum sum of strains on <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> at different elevations of the same cross section was taken as the objective. Positions of <b>soil</b> <b>nails,</b> circular slip surface, and boundary conditions of the <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> were summarized and taken as constraints.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new measurement technology {{characterized by the}} use of distributed optical fiber sensor (OFSs) for monitoring the strain and temperature distribution of glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) bar <b>soil</b> <b>nails.</b> Laboratory tension tests were used to verify the performance of the OFSs for strain and elongation monitoring of GFRP bars. The measured strain data from the OFSs agree fairly well with the data from strain gauges in calibration tests. In field monitoring tests, two GFRP bar <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> were installed with OFSs and pure strain data were used to evaluate the performance of GFRP bar <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> after installation in a practical slope. Both the strain and temperature distributions measured by the OFSs show symmetric features. A Brillouin optical time domain analysis (BOTDA) measurement unit was used to collect temperature and strain data from the OFSs. The monitoring data show that the accumulative elongations of the <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> present a continuous but limited increase with time in the field. The achieved maximum elongations of <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> were less than 0. 4 mm. The measured axial elongations of the <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> were also validated using corresponding data predicted by a theoretical model. The test results from the present study prove that BOTDA based sensors are useful for the investigation of the average strain distributions (or elongation) of long <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> and these data are useful for the estimation of the potential sliding surface of the entire <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> system.

50|$|One great {{advantage}} of <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> walls is their cost-effectiveness over other alternatives. When conventional soil nailing construction procedures are used, <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> walls {{are much more}} economical than concrete gravity walls and similarly or more cost effective than ground anchor walls.|$|E
50|$|After a {{preliminary}} {{analysis of the}} site, initial designs of the <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> wall can be begin. This begins with a selection of limit states and design approaches. The two most common limit states used in <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> wall design is strength limit and service limit states. The strength limit state is the limit state that addresses potential failure mechanisms or collapse states of the <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> wall system. The service limit state is the limit state that addresses loss of service function resulting from excessive wall deformation and is defined by restrictions in stress, deformation and facing crack width under regular service conditions. The two most common design approaches for <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> walls are limit state design and service load design.|$|E

For {{studying}} {{the mechanism of}} the composite <b>soil</b> <b>nailing,</b> this paper applies FLAC- 3 D to simulate pure <b>soil</b> <b>nailing,</b> <b>soil</b> nailing-soil anchor, soil nailing-micro pile-soil anchor. The analytical results as follows: (1) Because of the anchoring of the anchor, the axial tension of <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> in each row is {{much smaller than the}} one in the pure <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> supporting, and the tension of <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> which are closed to soil anchor decreases obviously. (2) The extrusion action of prestressed anchor makes the potential slip surface backward shifts and the sliding radius increases, which is better for the stability of foundation pit side (3) Micro-pile increases the strength of the soil in a certain range and improves the initial stress field before the excavation. (4) The inner force of the whole <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> and the prestress anchor declines but the drop is not large after the establishment of the micro-pile support in advance.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the correlation between}} peak pullout resistance of <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> and some key parameters, and quantify the influences of grouting pressure, overburden stress and dilation angle of soils on the peak pullout resistance of <b>soil</b> <b>nails,</b> the correlation between cavity expansion theory and surrounding pressure on failure surface of <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> was firstly proposed. Then, {{the relationship of the}} normal stress on the failure surface and peak pullout resistance of <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> was derived according to Mohr-Column failure theory. In addition, the calculation method for peak pullout resistance was validated by laboratory test data and model data. Finally, a parametric study was carried out according to the proposed simple model to {{investigate the}} influence of different parameters on the peak pullout resistance of <b>soil</b> <b>nails.</b> This model was simple {{to be used in the}} design. Parametric study indicates that the grouting pressure, overburden stress and failure surface distance have interactive influence on the peak pullout resistance of <b>soil</b> <b>nails,</b> and their increasing rates under grouting pressure are much larger than that without grouting pressure.

40|$|Finite {{difference}} {{analyses were}} conducted to explore the possible behaviour of <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> in loose fill slopes which were formed by strain-softening materials. Numerical models simulating a 20 m high 35 degrees loose fill slope were set up. With the use of an undrained strain-softening soil model, the behaviour of a loose fill slope reinforced with <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> subjected to rainfall infiltration was studied. Results indicated that <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> together with a proper facing structure may reduce the deformation of a loose fill slope caused by rainfall infiltration and hence maintain the stability of the slope. Tensile forces in the <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> were mobilised through the effective connections between the facing structure and the nail heads when a potential slide was being initiated. Through this mechanism, the development of a flow slide at shallow depths could be avoided by the pull out resistance between the <b>soil</b> and the <b>nails</b> at deeper locations of the slope. Results also showed that, if the <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> were not connected to a facing structure or nail heads at the slope surface, a global failure mechanism involving the development of a flow slide could be observed, which was similar to that of a loose fill slope without <b>soil</b> <b>nails.</b> (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

50|$|Four {{main points}} to be {{considered}} in determining if soil nailing would be an effective retention technique are as follows. First, the existing ground conditions should be examined. Next, the advantages and disadvantages for a <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> wall should be assessed for the particular application being considered. Then other systems should be considered for the particular application. Finally, cost of the <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> wall should be considered. <b>Soil</b> <b>nail</b> walls can be used for a variety of soil types and conditions. The most favorable conditions for soil nailing are as follows: The soil should be able to stand unsupported one to two meters high for a minimum of two days when cut vertical or nearly vertical. Also all soil nails within a cross section should be located above the groundwater table. If the soil nails are not located above the groundwater table, the groundwater should not negatively affect the face of the excavation, the bond between the ground and the <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> itself. Based upon these favorable conditions for soil nailing stiff to hard fine-grained soils which include stiff to hard clays, clayey silts, silty clays, sandy clays, and sandy silts are preferred soils. Sand and gravels which are dense to very dense soils with some apparent cohesion also work well for soil nailing. Weathered rock is also acceptable as long as the rock is weathered evenly throughout (meaning no weakness planes). Finally, glacial soils work well for soil nailing.|$|E
50|$|With {{the design}} complete, {{construction}} {{is the next}} step. Most <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> wall construction follows a specific procedure. First a cut is excavated and temporary bracing is put in place if necessary. This is done with conventional earth moving equipment and hydraulic drills. Next, holes for the soil nails are drilled at predetermined locations as specified by the design engineer. The equipment used for this step {{is dependent on the}} stability of the material in which the <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> wall is supporting. Rotary or rotary percussive methods using air flush or dry auger methods can be used with stable ground. For unstable ground, single tube and duplex rotary methods with air and water flush or hollow stem auger methods are used. With the holes drilled, {{the next step is to}} install and grout the nails into place. After all nails are inserted, a drainage system is put into place. Synthetic drainage mat is placed vertically between the nail heads, which are extended down to the base of the wall where they are most commonly connected to a footing drain. A layer of shotcrete is applied and bearing plates are installed before a final facing is put in place to complete the <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> wall. Variations of the steps described above may be necessary to accommodate additional preparation tasks or supplementary activities for specific project conditions.|$|E
50|$|Soil nailing is a {{technique}} in which soil slopes, excavations or retaining walls are reinforced by the insertion of relatively slender elements - normally steel reinforcing bars. The bars are usually installed into a pre-drilled hole and then grouted into place or drilled and grouted simultaneously. They are usually installed untensioned at a slight downward inclination. A rigid or flexible facing (often sprayed concrete) or isolated <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> heads may be used at the surface.|$|E
50|$|The first {{application}} of <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> was implemented in 1972 for a railroad widening project near Versailles, France. <b>Soil</b> <b>nails</b> {{were used to}} stabilize an 18 m high slope consisting of sandy soil. This method {{proved to be more}} cost-effective, {{while at the same time}} cut down the construction time when compared to other conventional support methods. Germany was the next country to investigate <b>soil</b> <b>nailing.</b> From 1975 to 1981 the University of Karlsruhe and the construction company Bauer collaborated to establish a research program. This program conducted full scale testing of experimental walls with different configurations and developed analysis procedures for use in design. The United States first used <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> in 1976 for the support of a 13.7 m deep foundation excavation in dense silty sands. <b>Soil</b> <b>nailing</b> was implemented in the expansion of The Good Samaritan Hospital in Portland, Oregon. This retaining system was produced in approximately half the time at about 85% of the cost of conventional retaining systems.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made into}} the relative costs of excavation retention by two systems: conventional soldier pile-wale-tieback support, and support by <b>soil</b> <b>nailing.</b> The investigation included design of excavation supports by the two aforementioned systems for fifteen actual excavations, the majority of which were accomplished in the Louisville, Kentucky area. The design was optimized to arrive at minimum cost solutions. In all cases, the <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> system was much less costly than the conventional system. Several factors appeared to make <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> more economical than conventional retention systems, if deformations and settlement of <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> systems can be tolerated: lower cost for construction materials; quicker mobilization of installation equipment; faster construction time; smaller construction space requirements; and less need for heavy equipment...|$|R
50|$|Since {{its first}} {{application}} using modern techniques in Versailles in 1972, <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> {{is now a}} well-established technique around the world. One of the first national guideline publications for <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> was produced in Japan in 1987. The U.S. Federal Highway Administration issued guideline publications in 1996 and 2003.|$|R
50|$|Inspection {{activities}} play a {{vital role}} in the production of high-quality <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> walls because conformance to project plans and specifications should result in a <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> wall that will perform its intended duty for its designed duration. Inspections usually involve evaluation of the following: conformance of system components to material specification, conformance of construction methods to execution specifications, conformance to short-term performance specifications, and long-term monitoring. Short-term performance specifications are checked with loads tests, which utilize hydraulic jacks and pumps to perform several load applications. Three common load tests for short-term performance are verification or ultimate load tests, proof tests and creep tests. Verification or ultimate load tests are conducted to verify the compliance of the soil nails with pullout capacity and strengths resulting from the contractor's installation method. Proof tests are intended to verify that the contractor's construction procedure has been consistent and that the nails have not been drilled and grouted in a soil zone not tested in the verification stage. Creep tests are performed to ensure that the nail design loads can be safely carried throughout the structure's service life.|$|E
50|$|Shotcrete {{reinforcement}} {{and ground}} support is utilized at the tunnel portals {{and in the}} interior of the wine caves. At the portals, <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> and shotcrete walls are typically used for permanent support and are constructed from the top down in lifts. Soil nails are installed 4 to 6 ft (1.2 to 1.8 m) apart in the horizontal and vertical directions. The shotcrete is typically a minimum of 6 inches (15 cm) thick and reinforced with welded wire fabric. The typical 4,000 psi (28 MPa) design strength mix is applied using the wet process.|$|E
50|$|Another nailing {{system is}} the <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> and root {{technology}} (SNART). Here, steel nails are inserted very rapidly into a slope by percussion, vibration or screw methods. Grid spacing is typically 0.8 to 1.5 m, nails are 25 to 50 mm in diameter and may be as long as 20 m. Nails are installed perpendicular to and through the failure plane, and are designed to resist bending and shear (rather than tension) using geotechnical engineering principles. Potential failure surfaces less than 2 m deep normally require the nails to be wider near the top, which may be achieved with steel plates fastened at the nail heads. Plant roots often form an effective and aesthetic facing to prevent soil loss between the nails.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} prevent earthquake-induced hazards, many {{countermeasures}} are developed to improve the stability of slopes, among which the <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> reinforcement is widely used. The behaviors of the cohesive soil slopes reinforced with <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> during earthquake are investigated using centrifuge modeling tests; and the unreinforced slope is also investigated for comparison. The responses of the slope reinforced with <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> are measured during the test, including the time-history curves of displacements and accelerations of the slope. On {{the basis of the}} responses of the slope reinforced with <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> and the unreinforced slope by the comparison, the deformation rules and reinforcement mechanisms are discussed. The test results show that the nailing arrests a landslide that occurs in the unreinforced slope during earthquake. The displacement of the slope exhibits an evidently irreversible deformation accumulation that is dependent on the magnitude of seismic input amplitudes. The <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> reinforcement mechanism is analyzed based on the comparison of displacement distribution of the lateral sides of both slopes with introducing strain analysis of a soil element within the slope. It can be concluded that the <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> can significantly change the displacement distribution and reduce the shear deformation of the slope. Thus, the possible sliding can be prevented in the reinforced slope during the earthquake and the slope stability can be increased significantly. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

It is complicated to predict deformation of <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> during excavating. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is developed very quickly these years, which can be applied in diverse applications such as complex non-linear function mapping, pattern recognition, image processing and so on, and has been widely used in many fields, including geotechnical engineering. In this paper, the artificial neural network is applied for deformation prediction for <b>soil</b> <b>nailing</b> in deep excavation.

40|$|The pullout {{behaviour}} of cement-grouted <b>soil</b> <b>nails,</b> {{particularly in}} field conditions, {{is not yet}} fully understood. In this study, {{a series of tests}} was conducted to evaluate the pullout response of grouted <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> in a field slope. A new innovative grouting packer system was developed to control the grouted length and maintain the cement grout pressure of the grouted part. By using the grouting packer system, a total of 10 <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> placed at different soil depths were grouted with different pressures in the field. The pullout results of present field tests and a number of past laboratory tests indicate that the apparent coefficient of friction (ACF) decreases with the increase of overburden stress even though grouting pressure is applied. In addition, when the overburden stress is unchanged, the obtained ACF values in the field tests appear to increase almost linearly with the increase of grouting pressure. After the <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> were completely pulled out of the ground, the surfaces of the <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> and surrounding <b>soil</b> were examined. It is found that the water content of the soil samples at the soil-nail interfaces decrease substantially compared to the water content of soil samples in drill holes. Measurement results also show that the failure surfaces of <b>soil</b> <b>nails</b> shifted about 16 mm on average into the surrounding soil due to the application of grouting pressure.

50|$|Soil nailing is a {{construction}} remedial measure to treat unstable natural soil slopes or as {{a construction}} technique {{that allows the}} safe over-steepening of new or existing soil slopes. The technique involves the insertion of relatively slender reinforcing elements into the slope - often general purpose reinforcing bars (rebar) although proprietary solid or hollow-system bars are also available. Solid bars are usually installed into pre-drilled holes and then grouted into place using a separate grout line, whereas hollow bars may be drilled and grouted simultaneously {{by the use of}} a sacrificial drill bit and by pumping grout down the hollow bar as drilling progresses. Kinetic methods of firing relatively short bars into soil slopes have also been developed. Bars installed using drilling techniques are usually fully grouted and installed at a slight downward inclination with bars installed at regularly spaced points across the slope face. A rigid facing (often pneumatically applied concrete, otherwise known as shotcrete) or isolated <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> head plates may be used at the surface. Alternatively a flexible reinforcing mesh may be held against the soil face beneath the head plates. Rabbit proof wire mesh and environmental erosion control fabrics and may be used in conjunction with flexible mesh facing where environmental conditions dictate.|$|E
40|$|Evidences {{from the}} field and {{full-scale}} laboratory tests suggest that <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> walls perform remarkably well under seismic conditions.

40|$|Pull-out {{strength}} of a <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> is an important parameter {{in the design of}} a soil nailing system. The pull-out strength is determined by the normal stress acting on the <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> surface during pull-out. The variation of normal stress in soil surrounding a drill-and-grout <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> during drilling, grouting and pull-out is studied through both laboratory pull-out tests and numerical simulation. It is found that for a drill-and-grout <b>soil</b> <b>nail,</b> most of the normal stress in the soil surrounding the hole is released after drilling. For a <b>soil</b> <b>nail</b> grouted under low pressure, the normal stress does not substantially recover after the nail is installed. During pull-out, the normal stress acting on the nail increases with the increase in pull-out distance because of the constrained dilatancy of the soil surrounding the nail, which eventually increases the pull-out resistance. It is indicated that the dilatancy of the soil is very important to a drill-and-grout <b>soil</b> <b>nail.</b> For soils with low dilatancy, further measures, such as high pressure grouting should be employed to compensate the released stress during drilling.
