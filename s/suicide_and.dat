40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{capacity}} of Durkheim 2 ̆ 7 s <b>suicide</b> theory <b>and</b> Hirschi 2 ̆ 7 s control theory to explain the <b>suicide</b> ideation <b>and</b> <b>suicide</b> attempt of Asian youth. Using a sample of National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this research examines how parental support, exposure to suicidal behavior, education satisfaction can accumulate <b>and</b> lead to <b>suicide</b> ideation <b>and</b> <b>suicide</b> attempt among Asian youth. It also explores the effects of religion and marriage in shaping their <b>suicide</b> ideation <b>and</b> attempting <b>suicide.</b> The results reveal that exposure to suicidal behavior {{increases the likelihood of}} <b>suicide</b> ideation <b>and</b> <b>suicide</b> attempt for Asian youth. The results also reveal that education satisfaction is negatively related to <b>suicide</b> ideation <b>and</b> <b>suicide</b> attempt for Asian youth. The results are discussed in light of Durkheim 2 ̆ 7 s <b>suicide</b> theory <b>and</b> Hirschi 2 ̆ 7 s control theory, and the importance of studying suicide issues among adolescents...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{study the}} {{association}} of mortality from accidents, <b>suicides,</b> <b>and</b> other violent deaths with serum cholesterol concentration. DESIGN [...] Baseline measurements in two randomly chosen independent cohorts were carried out in 1972 and 1977. Mortality was monitored over 10 - 15 years through the national death registry. SETTING [...] Eastern Finland. SUBJECTS [...] The two cohorts comprised men (n = 10, 898) and women (n = 11, 534) born between 1913 and 1947. There were 193 deaths due to accidents, <b>suicides,</b> <b>and</b> violence among men and 43 among women. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Mortality from accidents, <b>suicides,</b> <b>and</b> other violent deaths {{was used as the}} end point. Deaths from these causes were pooled together in the analyses. RESULTS [...] Serum cholesterol concentration was not associated with mortality from accidents, <b>suicides,</b> <b>and</b> other violent deaths in the univariate analyses or in the proportional hazards regression analyses including smoking, systolic blood pressure, alcohol drinking, and education. In both genders smoking was more prevalent among those who died from accidents, <b>suicides,</b> <b>and</b> other violent causes than from other causes. Frequent use of alcohol increased mortality from these causes. CONCLUSION [...] The risk of accidents, <b>suicides,</b> <b>and</b> other violent deaths was not related to serum cholesterol concentration, whereas such deaths were more prevalent in smokers and alcohol drinkers...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{sought to}} test the {{relationships}} between relative body weight <b>and</b> clinical depression, <b>suicide</b> ideation, <b>and</b> <b>suicide</b> attempts in an adult US general population sample. METHODS: Respondents were 40, 086 African American and White participants interviewed in a national survey. Outcome measures were past-year major depression, <b>suicide</b> ideation, <b>and</b> <b>suicide</b> attempts diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. The primary predictor was relative body weight, treated both continuously (i. e., body mass index [BMI]) and categorically in logistic regression analyses. Covariates included age, income and education, disease status, and drug and alcohol use. RESULTS: Relative body weight was associated with major depression, <b>suicide</b> attempts, <b>and</b> <b>suicide</b> ideation, although relationships were different for men and women. Among women, increased BMI was associated with both major depression <b>and</b> <b>suicide</b> ideation. Among men, lower BMI was associated with major depression, <b>suicide</b> attempts, <b>and</b> <b>suicide</b> ideation. There were no racial differences. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in BMI, or weight status, {{were associated with the}} probability of past-year major depression, <b>suicide</b> attempts, <b>and</b> <b>suicide</b> ideation. Longitudinal studies are needed to differentiate the causal pathways and mechanisms linking physical and psychiatric conditions...|$|R

5|$|The {{extent of}} Rommel's {{involvement}} in the military's resistance against Hitler or the 20 July plot is difficult to ascertain, as people most directly involved did not survive, and limited documentation of the conspirators' plans and preparations exists. Thus, Rommel's participation remains ambiguous, {{and the perception of}} it largely has its source in subsequent events, (especially Rommel's forced <b>suicide),</b> <b>and</b> the post-war accounts by surviving participants.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>suicide</b> ideation <b>and</b> interpersonal problem-solving skills was assessed {{in a sample}} of psychiatrically-hospitalized adolescents. Adolescents were categorized into groups of <b>suicide</b> ideators <b>and</b> <b>suicide</b> nonideators using the Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire. Adolescent <b>suicide</b> ideators <b>and</b> <b>suicide</b> nonideators were not significantly different in their performance on optional thinking tasks and means-end thinking tasks. Additionally, no between-group differences were found for gender and type of psychopathology. Results of discriminant analyses indicated that suicide indices, including suicide attempt history, best predicted group membership of <b>suicide</b> ideators <b>and</b> nonideators. Hierarchical and stepwise multiple regression analyses also suggested that suicide indices are the best predictors of suicide ideation; interpersonal problem-solving measures were not significantly related to suicide ideation. Thus, although a {{relationship between}} <b>suicide</b> ideation <b>and</b> cognitive rigidity has been found in adults, these results do not support such an association in psychiatrically-hospitalized adolescents. The implications of the findings for the assessment of <b>suicide</b> risk <b>and</b> for intervention strategies are discussed. Areas of future research are also identified. ...|$|R
