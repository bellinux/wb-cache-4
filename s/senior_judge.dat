The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit often summoned him to sit with that court to hear appeals, a task he found stimulating.

His father had nominated {{the son of}} Alexander, the Wicked Master, as heir to the earldom, returning the title to the senior line of the family, and thus Lindsay did not succeed to the earldom on his father's death. However, he was knighted in 1581, became a Lord of Session (a <b>senior</b> <b>judge),</b> taking the title Lord Edzell, in 1593, and in 1598 {{was appointed to the}} Privy Council.

5|$|The west {{range was}} entirely rebuilt by the Gilmours, in the 1660s, {{to provide a}} spacious suite of modern accommodation, to suit Sir John's {{position}} as a <b>senior</b> <b>judge.</b> The ground floor contained a large central drawing room dining room, with large windows, and a carved stone fireplace.

The judiciary has not, however, determined whether courtroom sharing may be possible among <b>senior</b> <b>judges</b> [...] the likeliest candidates for such an arrangement because of their reduced caseloads. Some active and <b>senior</b> <b>judges</b> in areas with a courtroom shortage are currently sharing space. Many of these judges oppose courtroom sharing because they believe that it interferes with the courts business and harms the judicial process. The judiciary plans to have some <b>senior</b> <b>judges</b> share space in future courthouse projects.
