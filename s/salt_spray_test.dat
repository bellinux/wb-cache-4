50|$|ASTM G85 is {{the most}} popular global test {{standard}} covering modified <b>salt</b> <b>spray</b> <b>tests.</b> There are five such tests altogether, referred to in ASTM G85 as annexes A1 through to A5. Many of these modified tests originally arose within particular industry sector, in order to address the need for a corrosion test capable of replicating the effects of naturally occurring corrosion and accelerate these effects.This acceleration arises through the use of chemically altered <b>salt</b> <b>spray</b> solutions, often combined with other test climates and in most cases, the relatively rapid cycling of these test climates over time. Although popular in certain industries, modified <b>salt</b> <b>spray</b> <b>testing</b> has in many cases been superseded by Cyclic corrosion testing (CCT) The type of environmental test chambers used for modified <b>salt</b> <b>spray</b> <b>testing</b> to ASTM G85 are generally similar to the chambers used for testing to ASTM B117, but will often have some additional features, such as an automatic climate cycling control system.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The QPQ {{complex salt}} bath {{treatment}} {{is a type}} of surface strengthening technology which contains mainly salt bath nitriding and salt bath post-oxidizing processes. The effect of nitriding temperature and duration on the corrosion resistance of QPQ treated specimens is explored by immersion <b>tests</b> and <b>salt</b> <b>spray</b> <b>tests</b> in this paper. The material used in this study was 1020 annealed steel. In the immersion tests, the specimens were immersed in 3 ‰H 2 O 2 and 10 % NaCl water solution. In the <b>salt</b> <b>spray</b> <b>tests,</b> specimens were <b>salt</b> <b>spray</b> <b>tested</b> using a 5 % NaCl neutral solution. The data indicate that, when the nitriding duration is less than 2 hours at temperature below 590 (phase change will exist when the nitriding temperature is above 590 according to Fe-N phase diagram), the higher temperature of the salt bath nitriding, the specimens will have the higher corrosion resistance. In addition we have found that nitriding for too short a time generates a thin compound layer, and nitriding for too long generates too much porosity. Both will deteriorate the corrosion resistance...|$|R

50|$|Hard {{chromium}} plating {{is subject to}} different types of quality requirements depending on the application; for instance, the plating on hydraulic piston rods are tested for corrosion resistance with a <b>salt</b> <b>spray</b> <b>test.</b>|$|E
50|$|However, these testing {{standards}} neither provide information of testing periods for the coatings to be evaluated, nor {{the appearance of}} corrosion products in form of salts. Requirements are agreed between customer and manufacturer. In the automotive industry requirements are specified under material specifications. Different coatings have different behavior in <b>salt</b> <b>spray</b> <b>test</b> and consequently, test duration will differ from one type of coating to another. For example, a typical electroplated zinc and yellow passivated steel part lasts 96 hours in <b>salt</b> <b>spray</b> <b>test</b> without white rust. Electroplated zinc-nickel steel parts can last more than 720 hours in NSS test without red rust (or 48 hours in CASS test without red rust) Requirements are established in test duration (hours) and coatings shall comply with minimum testing periods.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The QPQ {{complex salt}} bath {{treatment}} {{is a type}} of surface technology which contains mainly salt bath nitriding and post-oxidizing processes. The effect of QPQ oxidizing temperature and duration on the corrosion resistance of QPQ treated specimens has been explored by immersion <b>tests</b> and <b>salt</b> <b>spray</b> <b>tests</b> in this paper. All the specimens were post-oxidized after being nitrided at 570 for 2 hours. The material used in this study were 1020 steel. In the immersion tests, the specimens were immersed in 3 ‰ H 2 O 2 and 10 % NaCl water solution. In the <b>salt</b> <b>spray</b> <b>tests,</b> specimens were <b>salt</b> <b>spray</b> <b>tested</b> using 5 % NaCl neutral solution. From the experimental data, for high corrosion resistance, conclusions can be drawn:(1) appropriate temperature should be selected carefully in post-oxidizing stage. Too low or too high temperature would decrease the corrosion resistance. (2) The best post-oxidizing duration should generate magnetite film in porous area and should not collapse. (3) In second oxidizing stage, the porous area has been partly eliminated, so the duration should be less than the duration of post-oxidizing...|$|R

5000|$|Until the {{development}} of Cyclic Corrosion Testing, the traditional <b>Salt</b> <b>spray</b> <b>test</b> was virtually all that manufacturers could use for this purpose. However, this test was never intended for this purpose. Because the test conditions specified for salt spray testing are not typical of a naturally occurring environment, this type of test cannot {{be used as a}} reliable means of predicting the ‘real world’ service life expectancy for the samples under test. The sole purpose of the <b>salt</b> <b>spray</b> <b>test</b> is to compare and contrast results with previous experience to perform a quality audit. So, for example, a spray test can be used to ‘police’ a production process and forewarn of potential manufacturing problems or defects, which might affect corrosion resistance[...]|$|E
50|$|Salt spray {{testing is}} popular {{because it is}} {{relatively}} inexpensive, quick, well standardized, and reasonably repeatable. Although {{there may be a}} weak correlation between the duration in <b>salt</b> <b>spray</b> <b>test</b> and the expected life of a coating in certain coatings such as hot dip galvanized steel, this test has gained worldwide popularity due to low cost and quick results. Most Salt Spray Chambers today are being used NOT to predict the corrosion resistance of a coating, but to maintain coating processes such as pre-treatment and painting, electroplating, galvanizing, and the like, on a comparative basis. For example, pre-treated + painted components must pass 96 hours Neutral Salt Spray, to be accepted for production. Failure to meet this requirement implies instability in the chemical process of the pre-treatment, or the paint quality, which must be addressed immediately, so that the upcoming batches are of the desired quality. The longer the accelerated corrosion test, the longer the process remains out of control, and larger is the loss in the form of non-conforming batches.The principle application of the <b>salt</b> <b>spray</b> <b>test</b> is therefore enabling quick comparisons to be made between actual and expected corrosion resistance. Most commonly, the time taken for oxides to appear on the samples under test is compared to expectations, to determine whether the test is passed or failed. For this reason the <b>salt</b> <b>spray</b> <b>test</b> is most often deployed in a quality audit role, where, for example, {{it can be used to}} check the effectiveness of a production process, such as the surface coating of a metallic part.The <b>salt</b> <b>spray</b> <b>test</b> has little application in predicting how materials or surface coatings will resist corrosion in the real-world, because it does not create, replicate or accelerate real-world corrosive conditions. Cyclic corrosion testing is better suited to this.|$|E
5000|$|Variations to the <b>salt</b> <b>spray</b> <b>test</b> {{solutions}} {{depend upon}} the materials to be tested. The most common test for steel based materials is the Neutral <b>Salt</b> <b>Spray</b> <b>test</b> (often abbreviated to NSS) which {{reflects the fact that}} this type of test solution is prepared to a neutral pH of 6.5 to 7.2. Results are represented generally as testing hours in NSS without appearance of corrosion products (e.g. 720 h in NSS according to ISO 9227). Synthetic seawater solutions are also commonly specified by some companies and standards. Other test solutions have other chemicals added including acetic acid (often abbreviated to ASS) and acetic acid with copper chloride (often abbreviated to CASS) each one chosen for the evaluation of decorative coatings, such as electroplated copper-nickel-chromium, electroplated copper-nickel or anodized aluminum. These acidified test solutions generally have a pH of 3.1 to 3.3 ...|$|E

50|$|Although the {{majority}} of salt spray tests are continuous, i.e.; the samples under test {{are exposed to the}} continuous generation of salt fog for the entire duration of the test, a few do not require such exposure.

50|$|Hot-dip {{galvanized}} {{surfaces are}} not generally {{tested in a}} <b>salt</b> <b>spray</b> <b>test</b> (see ISO 1461 or ISO 10684). Hot-dip galvanizing produces zinc carbonates when exposed to a natural environment, thus protecting the coating metal and reducing the corrosion rate. The zinc carbonates are not produced when a hot-dip galvanized specimen is exposed to a salt spray fog, therefore this testing method does not give an accurate measurement of corrosion protection. ISO 9223 gives the guidelines for proper measurement of corrosion resistance for hot-dip galvanized specimens.|$|E
40|$|This work {{studied the}} effect of the {{addition}} of samarium (III) on the corrosion resistance of nickel coatings obtained from a sulfamate bath. The coatings obtained were characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The corrosion resistance of the coatings was evaluated in 5 % NaCl, employing electrochemical polarization measurement, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and <b>salt</b> <b>spray</b> <b>testing.</b> The results indicated that the coatings obtained using an electrochemical bath with 24. 6 mM of Sm 3 + had a grain size of 24. 4 nm. The SEM image of the cross-section of these coatings showed a microstructure with a columnar growth that was more compact than the microstructure obtained from Ni coatings untreated with samarium. Polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrated that corrosion current density decreased and charge transfer resistance increased when the concentration of samarium in the electrolyte bath was increased. Both results agreed with those obtained from <b>salt</b> <b>spray</b> <b>testing,</b> which indicated that Ni coatings obtained from a bath with 24. 6 mM of Sm 3 + showed the highest corrosion resistance (6096 h) ...|$|R

50|$|The {{salt spray}} (or salt fog) test is a {{standardized}} and popular corrosion test method, used to check corrosion resistance {{of materials and}} surface coatings. Usually, the materials to be tested are metallic (although stone, ceramics, and polymers may also be tested) and finished with a surface coating which is intended to provide a degree of corrosion protection to the underlying metal. Salt spray testing is an accelerated corrosion test that produces a corrosive attack to coated samples in order to evaluate (mostly comparatively) the suitability of the coating {{for use as a}} protective finish. The appearance of corrosion products (rust or other oxides) is evaluated after a pre-determined period of time. Test duration depends on the corrosion resistance of the coating; generally, the more corrosion resistant the coating is, the longer the period of testing before the appearance of corrosion/ rust.The <b>salt</b> <b>spray</b> <b>test</b> {{is one of the most}} widespread and long established corrosion tests. ASTM B117 was the first internationally recognized salt spray standard, originally published in 1939. Other important relevant standards are ISO9227, JIS Z 2371 and ASTM G85.|$|E
40|$|During {{preliminary}} {{vehicle design}} reviews, requests {{were made to}} change flight termination systems from an electroless nickel (EN) connector coating to a zinc-nickel (ZN) plating. The reason for these changes was due to a new NASA-STD- 6012 corrosion requirement where connectors must meet the performance requirement of 168 hr of exposure to salt spray. The specification for class F connectors, MIL-DTL- 38999, certifies the EN coating will meet a 48 -hr <b>salt</b> <b>spray</b> <b>test,</b> whereas the ZN is certified to meet a 168 -hr <b>salt</b> <b>spray</b> <b>test.</b> The ZN finish is a concern because Marshall Space Flight Center has no flight experience with ZN-finished connectors, and MSFC-STD- 3012 indicates that zinc and zinc alloys should not be used.
