500|$|On March 19, 2013, Entertainment Weekly {{announced}} that Shailene Woodley (who {{had recently been}} cast in, and was filming, Divergent) would play Hazel Grace Lancaster. Director Josh Boone said: [...] "We read close to 150 actresses for the role, and I saw about 50 of those. Within ten or fifteen seconds of Shailene's audition, I knew she was Hazel. <b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> script pages and just her eyes were peeking over them." [...] On May 10, 2013, Ansel Elgort was cast as Hazel's love interest, Augustus Waters. On July 23, Laura Dern joined the cast as Hazel's mother Frannie Lancaster, and Nat Wolff as Issac, Augustus' best friend. Wolff told HuffPost Live: [...] "It's exciting, I feel really lucky. The fact that I get to work with these super talented peopleI mean, that's {{part of the reason}} why, I'm good in the movie, that's the reason." [...] On August 14, Sam Trammell was cast as Hazel's father Michael Lancaster, and on August 28, author John Green {{announced that}} Mike Birbiglia would be playing Patrick. On September 6, he tweeted that Willem Dafoe would play Peter van Houten.|$|E

60|$|The footman {{tried to}} strike me again, but <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> hand.|$|E
60|$|Afore George {{could stop}} <b>'er</b> <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>'er</b> umbrella, and a 'ansom cab, with bells on its horse, crossed {{the road and}} {{pulled up in front}} of 'em. Ted nipped in first and Gerty {{followed}} 'im.|$|R
60|$|Upon {{her knees}} upon the ground, <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> both <b>her</b> hands, and swore it.|$|R
6000|$|But {{she paid}} no {{attention}} to his sound; <b>she</b> only <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> review and said: [...] "See what I've brought with me to read--Mr. Hoppus's article." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> finger. The {{door was}} quietly opened. Mr. Parker entered.|$|E
60|$|Amy {{did not say}} 'then {{they are}} false,' but <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> head.|$|E
60|$|So {{they opened}} the matter to her, and <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> hands and wondered.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> calmly <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> lips, and Mannering kissed {{them after}} a moment's hesitation. She {{remained}} {{by his side}} even {{when he turned to}} say farewell to Berenice.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is a whole}} spool of cotton," [...] said Mary. And, so saying, <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> in <b>her</b> {{hand the}} spool, to the thread of which she was tying her pebble stone.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> them <b>up</b> to <b>her</b> lips. Wolfenden {{was looking}} at a paper bag in her lap.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> face, {{he kissed}} her twice, and then turned and strode away.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> finger, but {{the stone}} would {{not live in}} the dull light.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> {{hand for}} silence, and {{finished}} the second tumbler of maraschino punch.|$|E
60|$|The negro-woman, {{with one}} finger upon her lips, as with an imploring, all but despairing look, <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> to him <b>her</b> little crucifix.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> quivering lips. <b>Her</b> father sobbed, but she, I remarked, did not. Having put her down, {{he shook}} hands with the rest present, and departed.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> {{stopped and}} <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> hand as though listening, and Larry laughed softly as a faint {{drumming}} of hoofs {{came back to}} them through {{the roar of the}} flood.|$|R
60|$|There was {{the sound}} of {{shuffling}} footsteps in the hall. <b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> finger cautiously.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> {{hands with}} a little gesture of horror. Her eyes were alight with fear.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> face to him. Her little bright-red lips {{moved as}} he fumbled under her chin.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> paused--but <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> hand at {{the same}} time, {{as a sign that}} she awaited no answer from me before she proceeded. When I entered the summer-house, no thought was in me of the woman in white. But now, Miss Halcombe's own words had put the memory of my {{adventure}} back in my mind. It remained there throughout the interview--remained, and not without a result.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{certainly}} have," [...] {{answered the}} little lady. [...] "My name is----." [...] Then she stopped suddenly {{and leaned over}} the balcony, while <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> one of <b>her</b> pink hands and whispered: [...] "Listen!" ...|$|R
6000|$|To my relief, {{she showed}} no sign of feeling it as I did. [...] "May I see you, in my way?" [...] <b>she</b> asked gently--and <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> pretty white hand. [...] "May I touch your face?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{emphasis}} in his tone, {{and a certain}} fixed look in his face chilled her. <b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> hands, and he stayed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ayacanora mind great monkeys--black, oh, so high," [...] and <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> hand {{above her}} head, {{and made a}} violent gesture of disgust.|$|E
60|$|For {{the first}} time she was unafraid of this big-bodied, black-browed men with the hairy-matted hands and fingers. <b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> left hand.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not your trade, {{but your}} amateur work!' said Mr. Cheviot, again exploding, and leaving Ethel to feel demolished. Why, she {{wondered}} presently, had <b>she</b> not <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> knitting, and merrily owned {{it for her}} trade--why, but because those laughs took away all merriment, all presence of mind, all but the endeavour not to be as cross as she felt. Was this systematic, or was it only bad taste? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, don't you know, sir? She had a young brother drowned, a {{long while}} ago, when she was sixteen or so. He went out fishing on the Sabbath, with another like him, and both were swamped. Wild young lads, both, as lads will be. But she, sweet maid, took it so to heart, that <b>she</b> never <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> head since; nor will, I think, at times, to her dying day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, I'll show you,' {{said his}} {{interesting}} companion; and <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> with <b>her</b> other hand a shoemaker's awl and a hammer. 'You must never {{do these things}} with a gimlet, because the wood-dust gets in; and when the buyers pour out the brandy that would tell them that the tub had been broached. An awl makes no dust, and the hole nearly closes up again. Now tap one of the hoops forward.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{leaned over}} towards him. [...] "It made me at first very angry," [...] she said. He {{glanced at her}} quickly. <b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "What the dickens is the matter? You look as dismal as a tombstone," [...] he said, as <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> hand to {{stop his}} lively whistling.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> {{other hand}} and thus stood beside him with slender neck {{stretched}} slightly forward, her lips parted, {{a look of}} intentness expressed {{in the whole of}} her exquisite face.|$|E
5000|$|In 1882 {{she assumed}} {{control over the}} Sherwood Select school as owner and {{consulting}} head, a position <b>she</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> to <b>her</b> one hundredth year in 1927, at which point it was renamed the Emily Howland School by the New York State Board of Regents. She became the first female director of a national bank in the United States, at the Aurora National Bank in Aurora, New York in 1890, where she served <b>up</b> to <b>her</b> death, at age 101. Howland was also active in women's suffrage and peace.|$|R
60|$|A wild bee {{settled on}} her arm, and <b>she</b> <b>held</b> it <b>up</b> between <b>her</b> and the sun, {{so that she}} might enjoy its dusky glamour. It would not sting her--not to-day! The little blue butterflies, too, kept {{alighting}} on her, who lay there so still. And the love-songs of the wood-pigeons never ceased, nor the faint swish of scything.|$|R
60|$|As Sandy and Andrew {{were quite}} {{conscious}} that their lady {{would be as}} good as her word, they at once proceeded to carry her orders into effect. The wheels of the portcullis and drawbridge were oiled, as were the bolts and hinges of the gate. The men were formed up in the courtyard, where presently they were joined by Marjory who had put on a light steel cap and a shirt of mail, and who had armed herself with a light sword. The men gathered round her enthusiastically, and would have burst into cheers had <b>she</b> not <b>held</b> <b>up</b> <b>her</b> hand to command silence.|$|R
