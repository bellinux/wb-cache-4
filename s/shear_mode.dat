2500|$|Kirkpatrick, Rankin & Long’s {{approach}} {{to the prediction of}} the enhanced punching strength of bridge deck slabs was based on the punching shear prediction equation derived by Long for the <b>shear</b> <b>mode</b> of punching failure, combined with an effective reinforcement ratio, which represented the arching action strength enhancement. The effective reinforcement ratio was determined from the maximum arching moment of resistance in a rigidly restrained concrete slab, which Rankin had derived for laterally restrained concrete slabs from McDowell, McKee and Sevin’s arching action deformation theory for masonry walls. [...] The derivation of the maximum arching moment of resistance of laterally restrained concrete bridge deck slabs utilised Rankin’s idealised elastic-plastic stress-strain criterion for concrete, valid for concrete cylinder strengths up to at least 70N/mm2, which he had derived on the basis of Hognestad, Hanson and McHenry’s ultimate parabolic stress block coefficients for concrete.|$|E

In FLG, <b>shear</b> <b>modes</b> {{play a critical}} role in understanding its distinctive properties. Unfortunately, energies of <b>shear</b> <b>modes</b> are so close to excitation lasers to be fully blocked by a Rayleigh rejecter. This greatly hinders investigations of <b>shear</b> <b>modes</b> in FLG. Here, we demonstrate dramatically enhanced <b>shear</b> <b>modes</b> in properly folded FLG. Benefiting from the extremely strong signals, for the first time, enhancement mechanism, vibrational symmetry, anharmonicity and electron-phonon coupling (EPC) of <b>shear</b> <b>modes</b> are uncovered through studies of two-dimensional (2 D) Raman mapping, polarization- and temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy.

Since nuclear electric quadrupole coupling to the DEFG is sensitive to acoustic <b>shear</b> <b>modes</b> only, nuclear acoustic resonance (NAR) is a particularly useful tool in studying the coupling of electrons to <b>shear</b> <b>modes</b> without being affected by volume dilatations. By extending previous NAR measurements in Nb, Mo and Ta to superconducting alloys Nb 1 -xMox it will be shown {{that the combination of}} NAR experiments with high-pressure Mössbauer isomer-shift measurements is of interest in {{a deeper understanding of the}} coupling of <b>shear</b> <b>modes</b> and volume dilatations to s- and d-electrons in transition metals...|$|R
40|$|We {{show that}} the <b>shear</b> <b>modes</b> in the neutron star crust are quite {{sensitive}} {{to the existence of}} nonuniform nuclear structures, so-called "pasta". Due to the existence of pasta phase, the frequencies of <b>shear</b> <b>modes</b> are reduced, where the dependence of fundamental frequency is different from that of overtones. Since the torsional shear frequencies depend strongly on the structure of pasta phase, through the observations of stellar oscillations, one can probe the pasta structure in the crust, although that is quite difficult via the other observations. Additionally, considering the effect of pasta phase, we show the possibility to explain the all observed frequencies in the SGR 1806 - 20 with using only crust torsional <b>shear</b> <b>modes...</b>|$|R
50|$|Three linearly {{independent}} cracking modes {{are used}} in fracture mechanics. These load types are categorized as Mode I, II, or III {{as shown in the}} figure. Mode I, shown to the left, is an opening (tensile) mode where the crack surfaces move directly apart. Mode II is a sliding (in-plane <b>shear)</b> <b>mode</b> where the crack surfaces slide over one another in a direction perpendicular to {{the leading edge of the}} crack. Mode III is a tearing (antiplane <b>shear)</b> <b>mode</b> where the crack surfaces move relative to one another and parallel to the leading edge of the crack.

These modes involve, respectively, fluid flowing as a result of {{pressure}} gradient between two stationary plates; fluid between two plates moving relative to one another; and fluid between two plates moving in the direction perpendicular to their planes. In all cases the magnetic field is perpendicular to the planes of the plates, so as to restrict fluid in the direction parallel to the plates.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the ultralow-frequency Raman response of atomically thin ReS 2, a special type of two-dimensional (2 D) semiconductors with unique distorted 1 T structure. Bilayer and few-layer ReS 2 exhibit rich Raman spectra at frequencies below 50 cm- 1, where {{a panoply of}} interlayer <b>shear</b> and breathing <b>modes</b> are observed. The emergence of these interlayer phonon modes indicate that the ReS 2 layers are coupled and stacked orderly, {{in contrast to the}} general belief that the ReS 2 layers are decoupled from one another. While the interlayer breathing modes can be described by a linear chain model as in other 2 D layered crystals, the <b>shear</b> <b>modes</b> exhibit distinctive behavior due to the in-plane lattice distortion. In particular, the two <b>shear</b> <b>modes</b> in bilayer ReS 2 are non-degenerate and well separated in the Raman spectrum, in contrast to the doubly degenerate <b>shear</b> <b>modes</b> in other 2 D materials. By carrying out comprehensive first-principles calculations, we can account for the frequency and Raman intensity of the interlayer modes, and determine the stacking order in bilayer ReS 2...|$|R

50|$|Another way to {{increase}} the performance of magnetorheological fluids is to apply a pressure to them. In particular the properties in term of yield strength can be increased up to ten times in <b>shear</b> <b>mode</b> and up five times in flow mode. The motivation of this behaviour is {{the increase in the}} ferromagnetic particles friction, as described by the semiempirical magneto-tribological model by Zhang et al. Even though applying a pressure strongly improves the magnetorheological fluids behaviour, particular attention must be paid in terms of mechanical resistance and chemical compatibility of the sealing system used.|$|E
50|$|The {{applications}} of these various modes are numerous. Flow mode {{can be used}} in dampers and shock absorbers, by using the movement to be controlled to force the fluid through channels, across which a magnetic field is applied. <b>Shear</b> <b>mode</b> is particularly useful in clutches and brakes - in places where rotational motion must be controlled. Squeeze-flow mode, on the other hand, is most suitable for applications controlling small, millimeter-order movements but involving large forces. This particular flow mode has seen the least investigation so far.Overall, between these three modes of operation, MR fluids can be applied successfully {{to a wide range of}} applications. However, some limitations exist which are necessary to mention here.|$|E
50|$|Spurious {{frequencies}} {{are also}} generated by subjecting the crystal to vibration. This modulates the resonant frequency {{to a small}} degree by {{the frequency of the}} vibrations. SC-cut crystals are designed to minimize the frequency effect of mounting stress and they are therefore less sensitive to vibration. Acceleration effects including gravity are also reduced with SC-cut crystals as is frequency change with time due to long term mounting stress variation.There are disadvantages with SC-cut <b>shear</b> <b>mode</b> crystals, such as the need for the maintaining oscillator to discriminate against other closely related unwanted modes and increased frequency change due to temperature when subject to a full ambient range. SC-cut crystals are most advantageous where temperature control at their temperature of zero temperature coefficient (turnover) is possible, under these circumstances an overall stability performance from premium units can approach the stability of Rubidium frequency standards.|$|E

It has been revealed that damping characteristics of adhesive are correlated to both frequency and mode shape. Young’s and shear moduli increase with frequency but damping on the other hand, decrease. The results showed that mode shape has an important role on the dynamic mechanical properties of adhesive. Modes that dominantly create normal stress on the adhesion surface represent higher stiffness and lower loss factor compared to <b>shear</b> <b>modes.</b> The different level of loss factors between bending <b>modes</b> and <b>shear</b> <b>modes</b> are notable, but damping property of bending <b>modes</b> and <b>shear</b> <b>modes</b> on the other hand, {{is in the same}} order and decreases with frequency.

50|$|The {{physical}} characteristics of rocks {{that control the}} rate and mode of strain, such as yield strength or viscosity, depend on the thermodynamic state of the rock and composition. The most important thermodynamic variables in this case are temperature and pressure. Both of these increase with depth, so to a first approximation the mode of deformation can {{be understood in terms}} of depth. Within the upper lithosphere, brittle deformation is common because under low pressure rocks have relatively low brittle strength, {{while at the same time}} low temperature reduces the likelihood of ductile flow. After the brittle-ductile transition zone, ductile deformation becomes dominant. Elastic deformation happens when the time scale of stress is shorter than the relaxation time for the material. Seismic waves are a common example of this type of deformation. At temperatures high enough to melt rocks, the ductile shear strength approaches zero, which is why <b>shear</b> <b>mode</b> elastic deformation (S-Waves) will not propagate through melts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Effect of high {{humidity}} {{on growth}} mechanism of a fatigue crack was investigated for an extruded bar of an age-hardened Al alloy 7075 -T 6 {{which had the}} marked texture of plane (111). Fracture in high humidity occurred by {{the growth of a}} <b>shear</b> <b>mode</b> crack under high stress levels, though a crack propagated in a tensile mode under low stress ones, macroscopically. Many voids and slip planes were observed on the fracture surface yielded by the <b>shear</b> <b>mode</b> crack. Especially most of the fracture surface was occupied by voids where the crack was small. The void percentage decreased with increasing in the crack depth. Fracture surface yielded by the <b>shear</b> <b>mode</b> crack was a plane (100). The growth direction of the <b>shear</b> <b>mode</b> crack to the cross section of specimen was about 55 ° corresponding to the angle composed by this plane and the texture of plane (111).

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this work is the {{comparison}} {{of the size of}} the plastic zone at the crack tip for two analysis methods: an analytical linear method and an elastic-plastic analysis employing the Finite Element method (ANSYS software). All calculations were made for a crack loaded under pure <b>shear</b> <b>modes.</b> These types of loading are not sufficiently described in the literature. The first part of this work introduces the problem with the crack tip plastic zone using both linear and nonlinear fracture parameters. The second part is dedicated to the construction of the Finite Element model in the ANSYS software.
