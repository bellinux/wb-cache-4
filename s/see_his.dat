5|$|The {{episode was}} written {{as a way}} to signal Mulder's exit from the FBI. The {{producers}} and writers felt that, if Mulder's character was given a clean exit, the show could more easily focus on the characters of John Doggett and Monica Reyes in the following season.

[...] "Colloquy with a Polish Aunt," [...] though, is one of Stevens' many poems that resists the intelligence almost successfully. The scholar Helen Vendler writes of this poem that [...] "Some readers have <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> subject as an epistemological one, and have written about his views on the imagination and its uneasy rapport with reality. Others have <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> subject as a moral one, a justification of an aesthetic hedonism. Still others have <b>seen</b> <b>his</b> subject as a native humanist one, the quest of the American Adam for a Paradise in the wilderness." ...|$|R

5|$|According to the {{official}} record (read by Thomas Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury, during an assembly of lords and commons at Westminster Hall on Tuesday 30 September), Richard gave up his crown willingly and ratified his deposition citing as a reason his own unworthiness as a monarch. On the other hand, the Traison et Mort Chronicle suggests otherwise. It describes a meeting between Richard and Henry that took place one day before the parliament's session. The king succumbed to blind rage, ordered his release from the Tower, called his cousin a traitor, demanded to <b>see</b> <b>his</b> wife and swore revenge throwing down his bonnet, while the duke refused to do anything without parliamentary approval.|$|E
5|$|After England {{lost the}} first three Tests (which {{included}} a 46 all out in the second innings of the third Test) {{there was talk of}} another blackwash series. England secured a victory in the fourth Test however, with Stewart’s two centuries and Fraser’s eight wickets being the main contributors to the win. This {{was the first time in}} 59 years that a visiting nation had won at the Kensington Oval. The main highlight of the series was to come in the final Test at Antigua, where Brian Lara broke Sobers' Test world record score of 365 not out, set 36 years earlier, by scoring 375. Lara was congratulated by Sobers, who was present on the ground to <b>see</b> <b>his</b> record broken.|$|E
5|$|After Grant {{retired from}} the screen, he became more active in business. He {{accepted}} {{a position on the}} board of directors at Fabergé. This position was not honorary, as some had assumed; Grant regularly attended meetings and travelled internationally to support them. His pay was modest in comparison to the millions of his film career, a salary of a reported $15,000 a year. Such was Grant's influence on the company that George Barrie once claimed that Grant had played a role in the growth of the firm to annual revenues of about $50 million in 1968, a growth of nearly 80% since the inaugural year in 1964. The position also permitted use of a private plane, which Grant could use to fly to <b>see</b> <b>his</b> daughter wherever her mother, Dyan Cannon, was working.|$|E
