Its effects on fasting and post-prandial plasma lipids and on other parameters linked to the cardiovascular risk are reviewed in this work. These effects are more favourable than Partially Hydrogenated Vegetable Oils on LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol, less favourable on LDL cholesterol than polyunsaturated oils, similar to monounsaturated oils. Epidemiological studies are rare and of poor quality. These data are discussed with highlights on the actual {{point of view on}} the role of saturated fatty acids in cardiovascular risk. An increasing and excessive intake of palm oil in our diet, through manufactured products, could be deleterious. However the real consumption of palm oil is not well known.

40|$|In {{the last}} five years or so, {{biofuels}} have been given notable consideration worldwide as an alternative to fossil fuels, due to their potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by partial replacement of oil as a transport fuel. The production of biofuels using a sustainable approach, should consider local production of biofuels, obtained from local feedstocks and adapted to the socio-economical and environmental characteristics of the particular region where they are developed. Thus, decentralized energy from waste systems will exploit local biomass to optimize their production and consumption. Waste streams such as agricultural and wood residues, municipal <b>solid</b> waste, <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils,</b> and algae residues can all be integrated in energy from waste systems. An integral optimization of decentralized energy from waste systems should not be based on the optimization of each single process, but the overall optimization of the whole process.

40|$|BACKGROUND Various <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> {{are used}} for cooking foods in India. Controversies have been created that {{consumption}} of certain <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> cause atherogenesis. A {{little is known about}} the effect of <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> in hypercholesterolaemic conditions. Hypercholesterolaemia, mainly the increased plasma Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) has been implicated in the early development and progression of atherosclerosis and Coronary Heart Diseases (CHD). Current study is designed to assess the effect of various <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> such as coconut, sunflower, palm, olive oil and vanaspati on lipid profile and oxidative stress parameters in rats fed on a high-cholesterol diet. MATERIALS AND METHODS Hypercholesterolaemia is induced by supplementing cholesterol with the basal diet. Reference dose of various <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> were administered once daily for 90 days. After the treatment period of 90 days, triacylglycerol, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol and oxidative stress parameters are estimated and analysed. RESULTS In the present study, we observed the lipid-lowering effect of various <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> in rats fed with high-cholesterol diet. Administration of cholesterol showed increased level of lipid profile. Concurrent administration of various <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> with high-cholesterol diet caused a significant decrease in serum total cholesterol, LDL and VLDL cholesterol. This conclusion is made based on the observation that the <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> were able to restore, at least partially, the lipid profile of hypercholesterolaemic rats. A decline of antioxidant status associated with an increase in lipid peroxidation was observed in all the <b>vegetable</b> <b>oil</b> treated groups. Among the oils, coconut oil showed a mild increase in High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL) and least increase in lipid peroxidation compared to other <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> treated groups. CONCLUSION Results suggest that the addition of <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> showed a positive influence on lipid metabolism in hypercholesterolaemic rats. Among the <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils,</b> coconut oil was found to be beneficial as it has more antioxidant property. These findings can provide useful information regarding the choice of <b>vegetable</b> <b>oils</b> in hypercholesterolaemic patients in future...|$|R
