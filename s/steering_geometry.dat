5|$|In 2011, Kooijman, et al., {{published}} an article in Science showing that neither gyroscopic effects nor so-called caster effects due to trail are necessary for a bike to balance itself.

Then they constructed a physical model to validate that prediction. This may require some of the details provided below about <b>steering</b> <b>geometry</b> or stability to be re-evaluated.

40|$|NoA {{vehicle that}} {{deviates}} laterally from its intended path of travel when the brakes are applied {{is considered to}} demonstrate ‘instability’ {{in the form of}} an unexpected and undesirable response to the driver input. Even where the magnitude of lateral displacement of the vehicle is small (i. e. ‘drift’ rather than ‘pull’) such a condition would be considered unacceptable by manufacturers and customers. Steering ‘drift’ during braking can be caused by several factors, some of which relate to vehicle design and others to external influences such as road conditions. The study presented here examines the causes and effects of steering drift during straight-line braking. A comparative analysis is made between two types of vehicle model: one built with rigid suspension components and the other with flexible components. In both the cases, the vehicle behaviour is simulated during braking in a straight line, and responses including lateral acceleration, yaw rate, and lateral displacement of the vehicle are predicted and analysed under fixed <b>steering</b> control. Suspension/steering <b>geometry</b> characteristics, namely toe steer and caster angle, have been studied to understand how the effect of variations in these parameters differs in models with rigid or flexible components drift during straight-line braking. Results from both vehicle models show that differences between rigid and flexible components can affect the predicted steering drift propensity. The differences between the two models have emphasized the importance of using flexible (compliant) components in vehicle handling simulations to achieve better correlation between prediction and experiment...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{design and}} {{development}} of the steering and suspension system for the USQ Motorsport team is presented. Formula SAE-A race car is presented. BACKGROUND Formula SAE-A is an annual competition for university students throughout Australia and around the world, it has been recognized by industry as providing some of the best graduating engineers because of the practical and teamwork experience obtained through participation. Each year SAE produces a list of rules for the design of the vehicles, the rules that directly affect this project are: 6. 1 Suspension, 6. 2 Ground Clearance, 6. 3 Wheels, 6. 4 Tyres, 6. 5 Steering and 6. 7 Rollover Stability. All vehicles are subject to a technical inspection to ensure the rules have been adhered to. OBJECTIVES The main objectives of this project were to identify and investigate possible changes to the existing design of the steering and suspension to improve the performance and reliability from a practical and safety aspect. PROJECT DETAIL The project is broken into two categories: 1 - Steering and suspension performance and 2 - Safety of the steering system. The WIN Geo software package (Wm. C. Mitchell) was used to analyse and optimise the <b>steering</b> and suspension <b>geometry</b> for improved performance and reliability. This design uses a rack and pinion steering with coil over shock absorbers and a double A-Arm suspension system. The steering safety was analysed and investigations led to designing a steering transfer system that allows an improvement of the drivers’ access and egress. CONCLUSIONS The results of this research will be given to the 2010 USQ Motorsport Team to determine the feasibility of their use in the 2010 ca...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a master thesis with the objective to develop an active toe angle concept on vehicles with a multi-link rear suspension. The result is a design for a concept which uses the roll of the vehicle and adjustments of the suspensions geometry as drivers. From a market analysis, three technologies are defined to actuate the toe angle of the rear wheels; four-wheel steering, four-wheel independent <b>steering</b> and active <b>geometry</b> suspension. Because of the opportunities of the latter, an addition on the current actuation is proposed. This new concept embodies two modes for a more stable but also a more agile ride. Current technologies are compared with the new concept using the customer attributes and it is concluded that active geometry suspension is favourable regarding the costs, the safety risks and the reduction of fuel consumption. To validate the performance of this new concept, a BMW E 60 vehicle model is created using Simulink and the effects of changing the suspension geometry are evaluated. With this bicycle model, the driving limits during cornering are mapped for the stable and agile mode. For the two modes, it is proven that they are effective to alter the vehicle dynamics to the desired response. In the stable mode, the possible cornering circumstances are increased. In the agile position, the yaw rate is increased and the turning radius decreased. With these results, the potential impact of the proposed concept is proven satisfactory. To select the position of actuation in the rear suspension, a model of the BMW’s rear suspension is built with the use of Lotus Suspension Analysis Software. This model is validated first on data available from the kinematics. With the model, the desired toe changed is searched by moving the joints. A isolated joint has been found which alters the roll steer without influencing the camber angle. The reaction forces on the joints are also checked for different modes and cornering situations, although the compliance was not taken into account. To conclude, a methodological approach is used to create a design proposal. First the House of Quality is used to determine which functional and technical attributes are important. The displacement range and the settling time are the most important functional attributes, while reduction of the actuated force, making the concept modular and reducing the cost are the technical attributes with the highest ranking. From the seven designs which have been created, a choice is made using a pairwise comparison. Since this method yielded no direct outcome, the insights from the comparison are used to create a new design, which is ultimately engineered for some key characteristics.
