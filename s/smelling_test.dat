40|$|The {{sense of}} smell of 106 {{alkaline}} battery workmen exposed at their work to cadmium and nickel dust has been compared with a control group of 84 men matched for age. The battery workers reported significantly more anosmia than the controls (15 % to zero) and did less well in the phenol <b>smelling</b> <b>test</b> (27 · 3 % to 4 · 8 %). Cadmium proteinuria was found in 17 of the battery workers, 11 of whom showed virtual anosmia. Figures of recent concentrations of cadmium and nickel in the atmosphere are given. The noses of 85 battery workers and 75 controls were examined. Signs of non-specific chronic irritation were more frequent in the battery workers but no significant relationship was established between this appearance {{and the presence of}} anosmia.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{correlate}} olfactory dysfunction in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with olfactory bulb and intracerebral abnormalities. In this context, the significance of diffusion-weighted sequences was investigated. The ethics committee of the Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin approved this study. A total of 36 MS patients were included in the study, which were examined by a neurologist and an ENT physician. The olfactory function of MS patients was measured by the TDI test, which investigates the olfactory threshold (T), the discrimination of odors (D) and the identification of odors (I). The results of the <b>smelling</b> <b>test</b> were compared with those of healthy volunteers. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed with special emphasis on the olfactory system. The volume of the olfactory bulb was determined by segmentation. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was used to evaluate fractional anisotropy (FA) determined in MS lesions within the brain and within the segmented olfactory brain. Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was used to compare the DTI data with those of healthy subjects. In summary, the results of the study indicate that a higher level of disability in MS is associated with a poorer sense of smell. A correlation between olfactory bulb volume and olfactory function of MS patients is only true in small bulb volumes. Compared with healthy subjects, the odor identification (I) of the olfactory function was significantly worse in MS patients. The decreased odor identification ability (I) correlated with poorer FA values derived from DTI data of the olfactory brain of MS patients. The TBSS analysis identifies regions within the right frontobasal brain where decreased FA values are shown in patients with reduced smell identification ability (I) ...|$|E

Study design We performed endocrine studies and <b>smell</b> <b>testing</b> (University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test) in 35 adolescent patients with molecularly confirmed CHARGE syndrome. Results Complete data on smell and puberty were available for 15 patients; 11 patients had both anosmia and HH, whereas 4 patients had normosmia/hyposmia and spontaneous puberty. In addition, 7 boys were highly suspected of having HH (they were too young for definite HH diagnosis, but all had cryptorchidism, micropenis, or both) and had anosmia. The type of CHD 7 mutation could not predict HH because a father and daughter with the same CHD 7 mutation were discordant for HH and anosmia.

Thus far, the definitive diagnosis of these dementias can only be confirmed at post-mortem. However, it is known that the loss of smell (anosmia) is an early symptom in patients who develop dementia, {{and the use of the}} <b>smell</b> <b>test</b> has been proposed as an early diagnostic procedure. The aim of this study was to understand further the extent of Lewy pathology in the olfactory system of patients with neurodegenerative disorders. Post-mortem tissue from 250 subjects was obtained from the OPTIMA brain bank. Five areas of the olfactory pathway were examined by immunolabelling for alpha-synuclein - a major component of Lewy pathology: the olfactory tract/bulb (n = 79), the anterior olfactory nucleus in the lateral olfactory gyrus (n = 193), the region of olfactory projection to the orbito-frontal cortex (n = 225), the hippocampus (n = 236) and the amygdala (n = 201). Results show that Lewy pathology affects different parts of the olfactory pathways differentially, suggesting a specific pattern of development of pathology. Clinical Parkinson's disease is most likely to be identified if the orbito-frontal cortex is affected, while the diagnosis is less likely if the pathology is restricted to the olfactory bulb or tract. These results suggest that pathology in the olfactory bulb and tract occurs prior to clinical signs of Parkinson's disease. Furthermore, the results presented here provide further evidence supporting the possible value of a <b>smell</b> <b>test</b> to aid the clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases...|$|R

Methods: We studied 36 patients with HH (31 males, 5 females, mean age 41. 5), 9 with familial and 27 with sporadic HH (33 congenital, 3 adult-onset), by physical examination, <b>smell</b> <b>test</b> (BSIT Sensonics), audiometry, renal ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging of the olfactory structures. Results: Based on the <b>smell</b> <b>test,</b> patients were classified as normosmic (n= 21, 58. 3 %) and hypo/anosmic (n= 15, 41. 6 %). Hypoplasy/agenesis of olfactory bulbs was found in 40 % of patients (10 / 25), (75 % hypo/anosmic, 7. 6 % normosmic, p< 0. 01, Fisher’s-test). Remarkably, olfactory structures were normal in 2 anosmic patients, while 1 normosmic patient presented a monolateral hypoplastic bulb. Fourteen of 33 patients (42. 4 %) presented neurosensorial hearing loss of various degrees (28. 5 % hypo/anosmic, 52. 6 % normosmic, p=NS). Renal ultrasound revealed 27. 7 % of cases with renal anomalies (26. 6 % hypo/anosmic, 28. 5 % normosmic, p=NS). At least one midline defects was found in 50 % of the patients (53. 3 % hypo/anosmic, 47. 6 % normosmic, p=NS), including abnormal palate, dental anomalies, pectus excavatum, bimanual synkinesis, iris coloboma and absent nasal cartilage. Anamnestically 4 / 31 patients reported cryptorchidism (25 % hypo/anosmic, 5. 2 % normosmic, p=NS). Conclusions: Hypo-anosmia is significantly related to anatomical anomalies of the olfactory bulbs/tracts but the prevalence of other developmental anomalies, especially midline defects and neurosensorial hearing loss, is high both in HH and Kallmann syndrome and independent of the presence of anosmia/hyposmia.

Two versions of the ETOC, one easy and one less easy, were used to test the olfactory performance of European citizens in three countries (France, Sweden and the Netherlands). The results indicated that neither version of the ETOC is culture-dependent, and that both give scores that well reflect the decrease in olfactory abilities with increasing age. A retest session showed that the less easy (and final) version of the ETOC is also highly reliable...|$|R
40|$|Olfactory {{dysfunction}} is {{an important}} public health problem in the United States, with approximately 14 million elderly Americans having chronic olfactory impairment. We performed a genome-wide linkage scan for loci influencing susceptibility to hyposmia in the Hutterites, a founder population of European ancestry. Using interviews regarding the olfactory medical history and psy-chophysical <b>smell</b> <b>testing,</b> we identified 25 individuals with severe hyposmia. Elimination of subjects with confounding conditions yielded 7 hyposmics for analysis. A 52 -member pedigree including all affected individuals was constructed from the larger,> 1623 -member pedigree, and a genome-wide screen for loci influencing the trait of hyposmia using 1123 markers was per-formed. Themost significant evidence for linkagewith hyposmia extended over a 45 cM region on chromosome 4 q (P = 0. 0013). Although this signal meets the criteria for suggestive linkage only and will require replication, these results offer the strongest data {{to date on the}} effects of genetic variation on olfactory dysfunction.
