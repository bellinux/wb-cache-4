Reduction of infiltration rates when PAM was applied with water containing Ca (applied as gypsum) was less than with PAM solution containing Na. Permeability tests of PAM solutions through uniform sands showed a decrease of permeability with increased concentrations, due to an apparent increase in effective viscosity of the solution. The decrease in infiltration rates {{in this study was}} likely due to this increase in viscosity when PAM is added to water. This research concluded that PAM applied in irrigation water will reduce infiltration unless the material improves surface soil aggregate structure and sustains pores sufficient to mask the effect of solution viscosity...|$|E
40|$|Digital soil {{property}} maps {{were generated}} at 30 meters resolution for the West of Honduras {{in order to}} develop the AGRI v. 1 tool (Monserrate et al., 2016). AGRI (from its Spanish words AGua para RIego) is a tool that combines information about climate, relief, soils, land cover, and hydrology to identify suitable water sources for implementing small irrigation projects. The soil properties mapped were sand (%), silt (%), clay (%), texture class, field capacity (v/v), wilting point (v/v), water holding capacity (v/v), and curve numbers. A database of 1887 points from González et al. (2008) were used to generate the maps of sand, silt, and clay. This database was also used to determine field capacity, wilting point and water-holding capacity for each point by applying pedotransfer functions according to Saxton & Rawls (2006). A regression kriging approach was performed by combining 80 % of point data with the terrain attributes aspect, mid-slope position, normalized height, plan and profile curvature, slope and topographic wetness index generated from a digital elevation model SRTM of 30 meters resolution. The combination of sand, silt, and clay maps resulted on texture class map. The curve number was mapped using the texture and land cover maps according to Soil Conservation Service of the United States of America (USDA-SCS, 1985). The maps performance was evaluated by the normalized root mean square error (RMSEn) expressed in percentage and using 20 % of data point not used for mapping.

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Since the 1930 's, many {{fields on}} the Crooked River National grasslands have been seeded to crested wheatgrass (Agropyron desertorum). While {{some of these}} fields remain {{dominated}} by crested wheatgrass others had a greater presence of deep rooted native perennial grasses such as bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata). Twenty eight fields previously seeded to crested wheatgrass were sampled to determine vegetation composition, soil nutrient status, and depth to the restrictive layer. Fourteen of the fields had a greater presence of native grasses and fourteen remain dominated by crested wheatgrass. In addition, root samples were collected from 10 of the 28 fields to determine the percent of root length colonized by mycorrhizae for crested wheatgrass and bluebunch wheatgrass. Soil samples from a random sample often fields {{were used to determine}} the genera of mycorrhizal fungi present. Vegetation and soil data were analyzed using multivariate methods. Results indicated that the two field types were different with respect to species composition confirming the appropriateness of the site selection criteria. The associated soil environmental variables also differed between field type. The strongest association was that of soil particle size. Fields with a greater presence of native grasses were positively associated with soils having a higher percent of clay and <b>silt.</b> <b>Fields</b> where crested wheatgrass remained dominant were strongly associated with soil having a higher percent sand.

Methods: Groundwater management system was installed with two drain spacing (3 m & 6 m) at <b>silt</b> loam <b>field</b> at the experimental station in National Institute of Crop Science, Korea. It was managed with two ground water level (0. 3 m & 0. 6 m) during the growing season. Results: The depth of groundwater table was significantly influenced on drainage amount from the soil profile through the drains. Soil water content, electrical conductivity and plant available nitrogen content in soil was significantly greater with 0. 3 m water table management plot compared to 0. 6 m plot and the control. At the vegetative stage chlorophyll concentration was significantly lower with higher water table control, but it was recovered at the post-flowering stage. Soybean yield was increased with groundwater management system and soybean yield with 6 M drain spacing and 0. 6 m water table level was 3. 38 ton/ha, which was 50 % greater compared to the control. Discussions: Groundwater management system directly influenced on drainage amounts, which significantly delayed the infiltration rate and nutrient loss.

40|$|Scree cones and slopes {{are common}} {{sedimentary}} landforms created by rock fall and rock particle fall in mountainous environments.

A case study in the southern highlands of Iceland provided a geological setting in a subarctic environment where the contribution of various erosion and deposition mechanisms {{to the development of}} scree deposits could be studied. Here, moderately-cohesive subglacial volcanic eruption products are continuously undercut by local streams, creating exposed and steep-sided canyon walls where scree cones and slopes are formed by dominant influences of freeze-thaw cycles and the wind on rock particle fall. The stratigraphy and the morphometry of these sedimentary landforms indicate that wet formative processes can contribute but are not as dominant. Avalanching of accumulated material occurs in dry conditions and creates distinct stratified sediments. The aeolian contribution to the scree development was studied by determining the physical requirements of particle detachment using wind tunnel simulations. Simulated threshold wind speeds of the removal of fines show that these wind and gust conditions are common in these areas in Iceland. A detailed particle analysis of the sediment from an isolated scree cone and the contributing rock face showed that sediments were depleted in the <b>silt</b> fractions. <b>Field</b> observations confirmed the influence of deflation where fine material is removed by the wind from exposed sediments whereas larger particles are excavated by the deflation of the surrounding matrix on the overlying rock face.

The data used in the analyses consist of in situ and passive microwave remotely sensed soil moisture data from the Southern Great Plains Hydrology Experiments 1997 and 1999 (SGP 97 and SGP 99) conducted in the Little Washita (LW) watershed, Oklahoma, and the Soil Moisture Experiments 2002 and 2005 (SMEX 02 and SMEX 05) in the Walnut Creek (WC) watershed, Iowa. Results show that in both the regions soil properties (i. e., percent silt, percent sand, and soil texture) and topography (elevation and slope) are significant physical controls jointly affecting the spatiotemporal evolution and time stability of soil moisture at both point and footprint scales. In Iowa, using point-scale soil moisture measurements, the WC 11 field {{was found to be}} more time stable (TS) than the WC 12 field. The common TS points using data across the 3 year period (2002 - 2005) were mostly located at moderate to high elevations in both the fields. Furthermore, the soil texture at these locations consists of either loam or clay loam soil. Drainage features and cropping practices also affected the field-scale soil moisture variability in the WC fields. In Oklahoma, the field having a flat topography (LW 21) showed the worst TS features compared to the fields having gently rolling topography (LW 03 and LW 13). The LW 13 <b>field</b> (<b>silt</b> loam) exhibited better time stability than the LW 03 field (sandy loam) and the LW 21 <b>field</b> (<b>silt</b> loam). At the RS footprint scale, in Iowa, the analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests show that the percent clay and percent sand are better able to discern the TS features of the footprints compared to the soil texture. The best soil indicator of soil moisture time stability is the loam soil texture. Furthermore, the hilltops (slope ~ 0 %- 0. 45 %) exhibited the best TS characteristics in Iowa. On the other hand, in Oklahoma, ANOVA results show that the footprints with sandy loam and loam soil texture are better indicators of the time stability phenomena. In terms of the hillslope position, footprints with mild slope (0. 93 %- 1. 85 %) are the best indicators of TS footprints.

One is a runoff system in the Zuni area of New Mexico where runoff farming has been practiced for over two millennia, {{and the other is}} an ancient rock mulch system in southeast Arizona that was abandoned over 500 years ago. Results of the Zuni study indicate that cultivation has had both positive and negative effects on soil productivity. Relative to uncultivated soils, cultivated soils tend to have slightly elevated bulk density and pH levels, and inconsistent changes in N and organic C. Soil changes at the levels found are not sufficient to indicate that cultivation caused degradation. Potential negative impacts are offset to varying degrees by thickened topsoils, co-sedimentation of organic matter and <b>silt</b> in <b>fields,</b> and organic matter coatings on peds;Extensive rock mulch features (grids, terraces, and rock piles) were built to conserve water and nutrients in the shallow rooting zone of the Safford fields of Arizona. Compared to uncultivated soils, mulched soils have elevated C, N, and available P concentrations and no evidence of soil compaction. Existing vegetation concentrated in the rock mulch features today demonstrates their effectiveness in conserving moisture and nutrients. There is no evidence that ancient rock mulch farming in Arizona caused soil degradation, and it appears that agricultural practices actually improved soil quality for crop production;An ancillary study was undertaken to measure soil changes caused by the western harvester ant (Pogonomymex occidentalis). This research aimed to determine their effect on soil productivity in the context of agricultural land use and landscape modifications. Results indicate that ant-affected soils have elevated levels of organic C, N, and available and total P, so they have a positive influence on agricultural soils. In addition to nutrient enrichment, ants help to aerate the soil and increase its hydraulic conductivity and water-holding capacity.

To study the effect of centrifugation conditions on soil moisture recovery and {{solute concentration}}, we sampled the subsoil (1. 5 – 3. 0 m depth) at commercial farms in the loess region of the Netherlands. The effect of time (20, 35, 60, 120 and 240 min) on recovery was studied at two levels of the relative centrifugal force (733 and 6597 g).

50|$|Since 1998, static slicing the {{material}} {{into the ground}} {{has proven to be}} the most efficient and most effective installation method because slicing maintains the soil {{on both sides of the}} fence, and is conducive to proper compaction—which is critical to performance, as well. In 2000 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) co-sponsored <b>silt</b> fence efficacy <b>field</b> research through its Environmental Technology Verification Program, and in general, the report found the static slicing method to be highly effective, and efficient. Silt fence effectiveness is best determined by how many hundreds of pounds of sediment are contained behind a given silt fence after a storm event, and not turbidity, etc. as sediment-retention is the end goal, and not a water-quality measurement used in erosion control, for instance. Silt fences may perform poorly for a variety of reasons, including improper location (e.g. placing fence where it will not pond runoff water), improper installation (e.g. failure to adequately embed and backfill the lower edge of fabric in the soil) and lack of maintenance—fabric falling off of the posts, or posts knocked down. A silt fence top-full of sediment may need maintenance/replacement, but it is a huge success. The fabric may become damaged with holes and tears if construction materials are stored next to or on top of the fence. During various phases of construction at a site, a silt fence may be removed relocated and reinstalled multiple times. It may be difficult to maintain effectiveness of a silt fence under such operating conditions. Location of fences in areas with high flows may lead to fence failures when the installation is not adequately back-filled and properly compacted, and/or the post-spacing is inadequate.|$|R

Development of a rapid method to visualise the AM fungal inhabited maize seedling roots was enhanced by an alternative light source on an Olympus SZIII dissection microscope.

40|$|Nitrogen (N) {{management}} in cereal crops {{has been the}} subject of considerable research and debate for several decades. Historic N management practices have contributed to low nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). Low NUE can be caused by such things as poor synchronization between soil N supply and crop demand, uniform application rates of fertilizer N to spatially variable landscapes, and failure to account for temporally variable influences on soil N supply and crop N need. Active canopy reflectance sensors and management zones (MZ) have been studied separately as possible plant- and soil-based N management tools to increase NUE. Recently, some have suggested that the integration of these two approaches would provide a more robust N management strategy that could more effectively account for soil and plant effects on crop N need. For this reason, the goal of this research was to develop an N application strategy that would account for spatial variability in soil properties and use active canopy reflectance sensors to determine in-season, on-the-go N fertilizer rates, thereby increasing NUE and economic return for producers over current N management practices. To address this overall goal, a series of studies were conducted to better understand active canopy sensor use and explore the possibility of integrating spatial soil data with active canopy sensors. Sensor placement to assess crop N status was first examined. It was found that the greatest reduction in error over sensing each individual row for a hypothetical 24 -row applicator was obtained with 2 - 3 sensors estimating an average chlorophyll index for the entire boom width. Next, use of active sensor-based soil organic matter (OM) estimation was compared to more conventional aerial image-based soil OM estimation. By adjusting regression intercept values for each field, OM could be predicted using either a single sensor or image data layer. The final study consisted of validation of the active sensor algorithm developed by Solari (2006), identification of soil variables for MZ delineation, and the possible integration of MZ and active sensors for N application. Crop response (sensor measured sufficiency index and yield) had the highest correlation with soil optical reflectance readings in sandy fields and with apparent soil electrical conductivity in <b>silt</b> loam <b>fields</b> with eroded slopes. Therefore, using these soil variables to delineate MZ allowed characterization of spatial patterns in both in-season crop response (sufficiency index) and yield. Compared to uniform N application, integrating MZ and sensor-based N application resulted in substantial N savings (~ 40 - 120 kg ha- 1) and increases in partial factor productivity (~ 13 - 75 kg grain (kg N applied) - 1) for fine-textured soils with eroded slopes. However, for coarser texture soils the current sensor-based N application algorithm may require further calibration, and for fields with no spatial variability there appears to be no benefit to using the algorithm. Collectively, results from these studies show promise for integrating active sensor-based N application and static soil-based MZ to increase NUE and economic return for producers over current N management strategies, but further research is needed to explore how best to integrate these two N management strategies...|$|R
40|$|The Markermeer is an {{important}} fresh water lake in {{the centre of the}} Netherlands. Because of its variety of functions and total scale of the lake, it is a unique area in Europe Over the years several problems have arrived in the Markermeer, which affect appropriate functioning of the lake. One of these problems is the decreasing ecological value (water quality) of the lake. This decrease in water quality is caused by a high turbidity of the water in the lake. Large amounts of mud sediment are suspended in the water column, even during normal conditions. This high turbidity has a large impact on the ecosystem. Rijkswaterstaat set up a study about several measures to decrease the high turbidity and improve the water quality of the lake. One of those measures is a deep silt trap, to catch the suspended sediment. Although some previous studies are carried out on the sediment behaviour in the Markermeer, the functioning of a silt trap is unknown. This MSc study focused on the mud dynamics in the Markermeer and the effects of a silt trap as a solution for the turbidity problem. Main question in this study is: Is a silt trap an effective measure to improve the water quality in the Markermeer? During construction of deep sand mining pits in the Markermeer, sedimentation rates in those pits were observed very high. Higher than expected from only settling of sediment from the water column. It is hypothesized that two mechanisms are responsible for the infill of the silt trap: settling of sediment from the water column and density currents. Density currents can be generated if a high sediment concentration layer exists near the lake bed and a density difference is present between two locations in the lake (for example near a <b>silt</b> trap). <b>Field</b> measurements showed that a high concentration layer (up to 800 mg/l) can exist near the bed of the Markermeer, under certain circumstances. To study the effects of a silt trap, a Delft 3 D model of the Markermeer is developed, which include the effect of density currents. This model showed that density currents can exists near a silt trap if the sediment concentration increases to 1 g/l near the bed. This occurs one day after a storm period. The dominant mechanism that fills the silt trap, differs for the two sediment fractions used in the model. For the fine fraction advection and settling of sediment is dominant. For the coarse fraction both mechanisms occur, although the settling process is of major importance. Also the effects of some design parameters of the trap are investigated, for example the orientation of the trap to the main flow direction (parallel and perpendicular). In both orientations a silt traps causes a reduction in concentration and an accumulation of sediment. However, a silt trap orientated perpendicular to the main flow direction has a higher efficiency. In the parallel case the trap attracts flow and causes an increase in flow velocity and turbulence intensity. This yields an increase of sediment in suspension which decreases the generation of density currents. Overall it can be concluded that a silt trap {{can be used as a}} mitigation measure for turbidity and improve the water quality. Although a silt trap will have a positive effect on the local scale, a silt trap alone will not work on the scale of the Markermeer. This is attributed to the enormous amount of fine sediment available and the extremely slow settling speed. The effect of the silt trap can be increased if it is combined with other measures to mitigate the turbidity problem. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|Soil erosion {{is one of}} the world’s {{most serious}} {{environmental}} problems (Jankauskas et al, 2008). It can cause extensive losses of crop yields and cultivated and potentially productive soils (Fullen & Catt, 2004; Morgan, 1995; Skoien, 1995). Soils which are highly eroded are more easily subjected to a redundancy of productivity and are poor environments for root growth, due to a degraded structure and lower organic matter contents (Frye et al., 1982; Lindstrom et al., 1994). The mountains and highlands of East Africa are facing the problems of land degradation as well, mainly due to the human impact on the natural ecosystems (Ezaza, 1992). This is enhanced by the high population density. Also deforestation of new land even on steep slopes and over-exploitation of mountain resources, due to the high population density has led to high soil erosion rates (Ezaza, 1988). Because this area is characterized by a steep and rugged topography and most people rely on agriculture due to the fertile soils and favorable agroclimate, many farms suffer from serious soil erosion. The aim of this research was to determine the relation of soil physical properties (i. e. aggregate stability, soil texture, bulk density, porosity, infiltration rate and soil cohesion) and soil erosion rates of several hill slopes with sparse vegetation in the Lushoto district situated in the West Usambara Mountains, Tanzania. To achieve this objective the soil physical properties of four highly erosive and four less erosive soils of hill slopes has been determined to find out which of the soil physical properties are contributing most to soil erosion. These hill slopes were approximately equal in amount of vegetation and slope angle. The MMF erosion model has been used to quantify the soil erosion for each hill slope where no erosion measurements are performed. The model has been validated on six other fields for which erosion measurements are performed by Wickama (2010). Aggregate stability was significantly higher for the non-erodible fields for both wet- and dryaggregates and is the most important soil physical property for erodibility of these fields. Difference between erodible and non-erodible fields for wet-aggregate stability is even more pronounced than the difference between these for dry-aggregate stability and shows that water is more important in eroding the soils than wind. Infiltration capacity values were equal higher for the erodible than non-erodible fields. This is contradicting with the aggregate stability values. Due to the installation of the double ring infiltrometer in the crust, which is formed by the disruption of aggregates, the crust is disturbed and infiltration can occur more easily than normally. Variation in profile depth and the occurrence of rubbers and plastics in the soils could have had a minor role in effecting the infiltration rates. Differences between soil texture for erodible and non-erodible fields are only apparent for the fine sand when both depth layer were taken together. For all eight research <b>fields</b> <b>silt</b> and clay content were such that the soils were not vulnerable to erosion with respect to soil texture. The eight fields of investigation, when compared for the erodible fields and non-erodible fields, were quite similar with respect to soil profiles. The erodible soils were somewhat more red and less yellow or brown. From this it can be concluded that on the erodible fields leaching of minerals has occurred leaving only iron and/or aluminium oxides in the soil. No differences occur with respect to soil cohesion and shear strength on the erodible and nonerodible fields. The same applies for bulk density and porosity. The MMF erosion model shows that the erodible and non-erodible fields are approximately equal in erosion rates in case of average rainfall, though when the ratio between rainfall and amount of rain days increases (rain intensity), which is predominantly the case when the amount of rainfall is above average, differences in the amount of erosion become clear: the erodible fields experience more erosion than the non-erodible fields. Protection of the fields to erosion is predominantly due to a high aggregate stability...|$|R
