40|$|Historically, the Savannah River Site (SRS) {{routinely}} produced special {{nuclear material}} (SNM), which provided stable measurement conditions for the non-destructive assay (NDA) methods. However, the main mission of SRS has changed from the production of SNM to the processing of waste and material stabilization. Currently, the purpose of processing is to recover the SNM from the waste and stabilization materials, much of which is from other DOE facilities. These missions are usually of a short duration, but require non-destructive assay (NDA) accountability measurements on materials of varying composition and geometric configuration. These missions usually have cost and time constraints, which sometimes require re-application of existing NDA methods to waste measurements. Usually, each new material or re-application of the NDA method to a different SNM campaign requires new standards and timely re-calibration of the method. These constraints provide numerous challenges for the NDA methods, particularly {{in the area of}} measurement uncertainty. This paper will discuss the challenges of these situations, mainly from a measurement and statistical point of view and provide some possible solutions to the problems encountered.

40|$|Prior to disposal, {{nuclear waste}} must be {{accurately}} characterized {{to identify and}} quantify the radioactive content. The DOE Complex faces {{the daunting task of}} measuring nuclear material with both a wide range of masses and matrices. Similarly daunting can be the selection of a non-destructive assay (NDA) technique(s) to efficiently perform the quantitative assay over the entire waste population. In fulfilling its role of a DOE Defense Programs nuclear User Facility/Technology Development Center, the Los Alamos National Laboratory Plutonium Facility recently tested three commercially built and owned, mobile nondestructive assay (NDA) systems with special nuclear materials (SNM). Two independent commercial companies financed the testing of their three mobile NDA systems at the site.

40|$|For {{detection}} and identification of nuclear material we equipped a transportable container with neutron and gamma measurement systems. The container itself provides the necessary infrastructure, e. g., energy supply, communication means, and work places. A <b>gamma</b> <b>scanner</b> of type RoSCAN complements {{the abilities of}} the system. A gamma scan can locate the nuclear material in an object of unknown inner structure and thus help to identify its type, e. g., nuclear or radiological. The <b>gamma</b> <b>scanner</b> is equipped with two different detectors. A CZT room temperature semi conductor detector is used if high resolution is crucial. A CsI scintillation detector with less energy resolution but more efficiency is used when a short measuring time is required. The CZT spectrum {{can also be used}} to run computer codes like MGA or MGAU for the determination of the isotopic composition of nuclear material. An optical (black and white) picture of the measurement situation is taken before the gamma measurement starts. The gamma scanning area is divided into minimum 9 and maximum 1728 fields and the fields are measured sequentially. After completion of the scan the measurement integral of each field is superimposed in different colors proportional to the gamma intensity on the optical picture. In addition, an energy spectrum can be displayed for each field. The RoSCAN can be controlled from a distance of up to 80 meters via cable. We have investigated in the possibility of locating nuclear material with this <b>gamma</b> <b>scanner.</b> Therefore, we performed measurements with different point sources at various distances and with different measuring times. We also applied different shielding to account for surrounding material and containers. Results of our measurements and limits of the system will be presented.

40|$|A {{methodology}} for nondestructive assay of drum packaged radioactive waste materials is investigated using Emission Computed Tomography procedures. A requirement {{of this method}} is accurate gamma attenuation correction. This is accomplished {{by the use of}} a constant density distribution for the drum content, thereby requiring the need for a homogeneous medium. The current predominant NDA technique is the use of the <b>Segmented</b> <b>Gamma</b> <b>Scanner.</b> Tomographic Gamma Scanning improves upon this method by providing a low resolution three-dimensional image of the source distribution, yielding both spatial and activity information. Reconstruction of the source distribution is accomplished by utilization of algebraic techniques with a nine by six voxel model with detector information gathered over scanning intervals of ninety degrees. Construction of a linear system to describe the scenario was accomplished using a point-source response function methodology, where a 54 {times} 120 matrix contained the projected detector responses for each source-detector geometry. Entries in this matrix were calculated using the point-kernal shielding code QAD-CGGP. Validation was performed using the MCNP photon transport code. Solutions to the linear system were determined using the Non-Negative Least Squares (NNLS) algorithm and the LSMOD algorithm. A series of four scans were performed, each reconstructing the source distribution of a mock-up waste package containing a single 73 mCi {sup 137 }Cs point source. For each scan, the source was located in a different location. Results of the reconstruction routines accurately predict the location and activity of the source. The range of activity calculated using the NNLS routine is 0. 2681 mCi with an average value of 77. 7995 mCi.

40|$|Many {{forms of}} nuclear waste {{materials}} are constantly generated at Los Alamos Chemical and Metallurgical Research (CMR) Facility. For disposal, {{accounting of the}} nuclear material must be done. We were recently tasked with measuring sixteen 55 -gallon drums, each containing about 150 to 250 grams of HEU. The lower two-thirds of the drums consisted mostly of paper, plastics, and other combustibles. The HEU in this bulk waste had been previously assayed using a <b>segmented</b> <b>gamma</b> <b>scanner</b> (SGS) and ranged from 1 to 20 grams per drum. The drums were later re-opened and specific packages of HEU waste solids, mostly polyethylene bottles filled with uranium oxide and/or fluoride, were placed {{on top of the}} bulk waste. The number of bottles ranged from one to seven with an additional {sup 235 }U mass between 150 to 230 grams per drum. Although many of these additional mass values were based on results from an old chemical analysis, they are expected to be reasonably accurate. We counted the drums on the SGS and shuffler instruments. The results were biased low on the SGS which was calibrated for normal combustible waste (not bottles embedded in waste) and biased high on the shuffler calibrated for small cans of oxide. The biases were caused by the differences among the calibration standards and the drums. This paper is a study of the nature of these biases, providing corrections and comparing the resulting performance characteristics of the instruments. This effort was greatly enhanced by having photographic as well as real-time radiographic information on many of the drums contents. A new software tool, recently developed at Los Alamos to calculate shuffler count rates accurately and generate bias correction factors, was applied to these drums. The application of the calculational tool to generate bias corrections for these types of matrices is described. The results from the two instruments are compared and discussed...|$|E

This study was performed on a full-scale vitrified ash sample prepared at LANL according to a procedure similar to that anticipated to be used at RFETS. This sample was composed of a borosilicate-based glass frit, blended with ash to produce a Pu content of {approximately} 1 wt %. The glass frit was taken to a degree of melting necessary to achieve a full encapsulation of the ash material. The NDA study performed on this sample showed that SGSs with either { 1 / 2 }- or 2 -inch collimation can achieve an accuracy better than 6 % relative to calorimetry and {gamma}-ray isotopics. This accuracy is achievable, after application of appropriate bias corrections, for transmissions of about { 1 / 2 } % through the waste form and counting times of less than 30 minutes. These results are valid for ash material and graphite fines with the same degree of plutonium particle size, homogeneity, sample density, and sample geometry as the waste form used to obtain the results in this study. A drum-sized thermal neutron counter (TNC) was also included in the study to provide an alternative in the event the SGS failed to meet the required level of accuracy. The preliminary indications are that this method will also achieve the required accuracy with counting times of {approximately} 30 minutes and appropriate application of bias corrections. The bias corrections can be avoided in all cases if the instruments are calibrated on standards matching the items...|$|E

In this paper, the authors examine three possible bias sources: (1) measurement error in the estimated transmission matrix, (2) the positivity constraint on the estimated mass of nuclear material, and (3) improper treatment of the measurement error structure.

Nuclear safeguards are an important tool to impede the illicit use of fissionalbe material. But the scope of safeguards is only nuclear material.

The accuracy {{of this technique}} relies {{on the assumption that}} the sample matrix and the activity are both uniform for a segment. Waste barrels are often highly heterogeneous, span a wide range of composition and matrix type. The primary sources of error are all directly or indirectly related to a non-uniform measurement response associated with unknown radioactive source spatial distribution and heterogeneity of the matrix. These errors can be significantly reduced by some imaging techniques that measure exact spatial locations of sources and attenuation maps. In this paper we describe a joint R&D effort between the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) and the Institute of Nuclear Techniques (INT) of the Technical University, Budapest, to compare results obtained by two different gamma-ray nondestructive assay (NDA) systems used for imaging waste barrels. The basic principles are the same, but the approaches are different. Key factors to judge the adequacy of a method are the detection limit and the accuracy. Test drums representing waste to be measured are used to determine basic parameters of these techniques...|$|R
40|$|Requirements for {{effective}} safeguards {{during the transition}} to environmental management at nuclear material production facilities within the DOE complex are deriving improvements in the accuracy of nondestructive assay (NDA) techniques. An {{important aspect of the}} transition is the need for facilities to terminate safeguards on waste materials, thus reducing the cost for safeguards at the facility. Requirements for the termination of safeguards on candidate waste material have been established by DOE to minimize the potential for diversion or theft of nuclear material. Because heterogenous waste and residue materials are stored in large containers such as 208 -L drums, conventional assay techniques such as <b>segmented</b> <b>gamma</b> scanning (SGS) that were developed to assay small samples cannot always provide accurate measurements. Consequently, facilities using the conventional NDA instrumentation may be limited in their ability to discard waste materials in compliance with DOE requirements. One technique being applied to improve the accuracy of assays of waste in large containers is computerized tomography (CT). Research on the application of CT to improve both neutron and gamma-ray assays of waste is being carried out at Los Alamos National Laboratory. For example, tomographic gamma scanning (TGS) is a single-photon emission CT technique that corrects for attenuation of gamma rays emitted from the sample using attenuation images from transmission CT...|$|R
