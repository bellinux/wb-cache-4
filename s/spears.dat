5|$|The Circus Starring Britney <b>Spears,</b> {{commonly}} referred to as the Circus Tour, was the seventh concert tour by American singer Britney <b>Spears.</b> It was launched in support of her sixth studio album, Circus (2008). Rumors of a tour arose as early as October 2007, after <b>Spears</b> released her fifth studio album Blackout; however, it was cancelled due to unknown reasons. The tour was officially announced in December 2008, with dates for American and British venues revealed. The stage was composed of three rings and set in-the-round to resemble an actual circus.

5|$|The video {{begins with}} <b>Spears</b> {{appearing}} bored in class at a Catholic high school. Her assistant Felicia Culotta {{played the role}} of Spears's teacher. When the bell rings, <b>Spears</b> runs out into the hall and begins a choreographed dance in the corridor. After this, <b>Spears</b> is outside, now adorned in an pink athletic outfit, and seen in a car. Along with a couple of other students, she performs a number of gymnastic moves before heading back inside. She is then sitting on the bleachers in the gymnasium watching a basketball game, and she dances in the gymnasium. Her love interest is revealed sitting close to her, played by her real-life cousin Chad. After this short segment, <b>Spears</b> begins her final dance routine and the video ends shortly afterwards, and the bell rings and <b>Spears</b> leaves the gymnasium, revealing that the whole thing had actually just been Spears's daydream. During the very beginning, <b>Spears</b> is seen with her sleeves down. Some people who see the music video may not recognize this, but when the bell rings, the sleeves of exactly the same gray-and-white shirt she is wearing are rolled up, even when she gets into singing.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} <b>Spears</b> at a vanity, putting Curious on and {{earrings}} by Bulgari. She is then seen holding a top hat {{in front of}} her face, while doves fly out of another hat. <b>Spears</b> starts singing in the vanity but stands up and puts on a ringmaster jacket. She walks through an aisle while dancing suggestively with several circus dancers. Throughout the video, there are interspersed scenes of different circus performers, including ribbon dancers, contortionists, clowns and a mime on stilts. There are also scenes of <b>Spears</b> singing with the top hat, wearing a nude body stocking in front of a red curtain, with a spotlight on her. This is followed by a group dance scene {{in the middle of a}} circus ring, where <b>Spears</b> wears the ringmaster jacket, sequined hot pants and a feathered top hat. In the second verse, she dances with a chair and a whip wearing a nude bra covered in leaves. The video continues with a series of intercut scenes, such as <b>Spears</b> in slow motion in front of a shower of sparks, her surrounded by a pair of lions and in front of an elephant.

5|$|This is {{followed}} with <b>Spears</b> performing a dance routine inside a blacklight paint graffiti room, {{and the two}} women dancing around a metal bedframe. <b>Spears</b> then begins chasing Madonna in a wooden-like maze, and the latter enters a room covered with fallen leaves and stands in a swing. Once <b>Spears</b> finds the room, Madonna {{is nowhere to be}} found. Throughout the video, Madonna gradually loses her symbolic power, paralleled by her disposing the cane and jacket, becoming less phallic and more noticeably female biologically and more feminine socially. Although it ultimately seems that <b>Spears</b> becomes the dominant figure, Madonna recovers her phallic power {{in the form of a}} cigar from an onlooking male. <b>Spears</b> appears in Madonna's room and throws her against the wall, and Madonna vanishes just as they are about to kiss. The video ends as Madonna's laugh is heard in the background.|$|E
5|$|A {{pastiche}} {{of following}} scenes alternates between <b>Spears</b> {{dancing on the}} soundstage, singing with the microphones and a scene of just red lips, {{a reference to the}} opening shot of the 1975 film The Rocky Horror Picture Show. This begins to show her losing grip, reminiscent of her break down. When the breakdown starts, she begins to eject painting through IVs in her fingers, staining the room and the monitors, symbolizing her own fall as her name becomes tainted. Then, two versions of <b>Spears,</b> both wearing blue and red dresses with flowing trains, are seen fighting each other, another symbolism, this time of her fighting her inner demons. After this, both versions of <b>Spears,</b> as well as her on the wedding dress, fall exhausted to the ground, symbolizing the lowest point of her life during the breakdown. While interspersed scenes of <b>Spears</b> in the soundstage are shown, the other versions of herself start to wake up, showing her getting her feet back on the ground and making a comeback, refusing to give up. The final scene shows <b>Spears</b> dressed in a short black dress with her dancers in black on a stage, with confetti and pyrotechnics around them. In the final shot a question mark (?) appears in multicolored letters. This final scene shows her as she once was, a superstar who is back to reclaim her title. The video ends with the same multicolored lettering of a question mark, symbolizing the unknown that is to come.|$|E
5|$|An {{international}} {{version of}} the video was also officially released.
