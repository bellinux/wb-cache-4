5|$|Lipid bilayers {{are large}} enough {{structures}} {{to have some}} of the mechanical properties of liquids or solids. The area compression modulus Ka, bending modulus Kb, and edge energy , can be used to describe them. Solid lipid bilayers also have a <b>shear</b> <b>modulus,</b> but like any liquid, the <b>shear</b> <b>modulus</b> is zero for fluid bilayers. These mechanical properties affect how the membrane functions. Ka and Kb affect the ability of proteins and small molecules to insert into the bilayer, and bilayer mechanical properties have been shown to alter the function of mechanically activated ion channels. Bilayer mechanical properties also govern what types of stress a cell can withstand without tearing. Although lipid bilayers can easily bend, most cannot stretch more than a few percent before rupturing.|$|E

Owing to its strong radioactivity, actinium glows in the dark with a pale blue light, which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles. Actinium has similar chemical properties to lanthanum and other lanthanides, and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores. Solvent extraction and ion chromatography are commonly used for the separation.|$|E

Ten subjects performed ten isometric elbow flexions consisting of linear torque ramps of 30 -s from 0 to 40 % of maximal voluntary contraction. The <b>shear</b> elastic <b>modulus</b> of each elbow flexor muscle (biceps brachii long head [BBLH], biceps brachii short head [BBSH], brachialis [BA], and brachoradialis [BR]) and of triceps brachii long head [TB] was measured twice with individual muscles recorded in separate trials in random order. A good repeatability of {{the shape of the}} changes in <b>shear</b> elastic <b>modulus</b> as a function of torque was found for each elbow flexor muscle (r-values: 0. 85 to 0. 94). Relationships between the <b>shear</b> elastic <b>modulus</b> and torque were best explained by a second order polynomial, except BA where a higher polynomial was required. Statistical analysis showed that BBSH and BBLH had an initial slow change at low torques followed by an increasing rate of increase in modulus with higher torques. In contrast, the BA <b>shear</b> elastic <b>modulus</b> increased rapidly at low forces, but plateaued at higher forces. These results suggest that changes in load sharing between synergist elbow flexors could partly explain the non-linear EMG-torque relationship classically reported for BB during isometric efforts.

5|$|Mimas, the {{innermost}} {{of the round}} moons of Saturn and directly interior to Enceladus, is a geologically dead body, even though it should experience stronger tidal forces than Enceladus. This apparent paradox can be explained in part by temperature-dependent properties of water ice (the main constituent of the interiors of Mimas and Enceladus). The tidal heating per unit mass is given by the formula , where ρ is the (mass) density of the satellite, n is its mean orbital motion, r is the satellite's radius, e is the orbital eccentricity of the satellite, μ is the <b>shear</b> <b>modulus</b> and Q is the dimensionless dissipation factor. For a same-temperature approximation, the expected value of qtid for Mimas is about 40 times that of Enceladus. However, the material parameters μ and Q are temperature dependent. At high temperatures (close to the melting point), μ and Q are low, so tidal heating is high. Modeling suggests that for Enceladus, both a 'basic' low-energy thermal state with little internal temperature gradient, and an 'excited' high-energy thermal state with a significant temperature gradient, and consequent convection (endogenic geologic activity), once established, would be stable. For Mimas, only a low-energy state {{is expected to be}} stable, despite its being closer to Saturn. So the model predicts a low-internal-temperature state for Mimas (values of μ and Q are high) but a possible higher-temperature state for Enceladus (values of μ and Q are low). Additional historical information is needed to explain how Enceladus first entered the high-energy state (e.g. more radiogenic heating or a more eccentric orbit in the past).|$|E

However, the most effective stretching positions for hamstrings are unclear because {{it is impossible to}} quantify muscle elongation directly and noninvasively in vivo. Recently, a new ultrasound technology, ultrasonic shear wave elastography, has permitted noninvasive and reliable measurement of muscle <b>shear</b> elastic <b>modulus,</b> which has a strong linear relationship to the amount of muscle elongation. This study aimed to investigate the effect of hip internal and external rotation on <b>shear</b> elastic <b>modulus</b> of the lateral and medial hamstrings, respectively, during stretching in vivo using ultrasonic shear wave elastography. Twenty-three healthy men (age, 23. 0 ± 2. 1 years) were recruited for this study.

In both BF and ST, the <b>shear</b> elastic <b>modulus</b> in the rest position was significantly lower than that in all stretching positions.

Whether habitual loading, such as participation in regular jumping activities, would induce adaptation on tendon {{mechanical properties}} remains unclear.

The CSA were larger by 24 – 29 % and by 22 – 24 % in the basketball players and volleyball players, for the dominant and non-dominant legs, respectively (all p < 0. 05).

RomanoschiThe primary {{objective}} of this research project was to evaluate the shear behavior of three asphalt-to-asphalt mix interfaces. To accomplish this objective, a special attachment and loading mechanism was designed and built to facilitate the measurement of the dynamic <b>shear</b> reaction <b>modulus</b> and <b>shear</b> strength of the asphalt-to-asphalt interfaces when shear and normal forces are acting simultaneously and they are proportional. Two tests were conducted on 4 -inch diameter cylindrical samples cored from an asphalt concrete pad where three types of asphalt-to- asphalt interfaces were built. For each interface, four tack-coat quantities were sprayed. On each sample, the Dynamic <b>Shear</b> Reaction <b>Modulus</b> test was conducted first. Then the Shear Strength test was conducted until the sample failed in shear at the interface. The experiments suggest that the shear strength of the interface is affected neither by the interface type nor by the tack-coat application rate.

Those measurements were made on spastic gastrocnemius medialis muscle at rest and at maximal passive stretching, in post-stroke hemiplegic patients. The paretic side measurements were compared to non-paretic side. Material and methodsFourteen patients took part in 2 inter-session reliability experiments, realized at a 7 days interval by the same operator. The Aixplorer® Supersonic US scanner with the transient ShearWave Elastography (SWE) software was used. The stretching experiments were made manually and controlled by a goniometer. ResultsThe reliability of the 2 D measurements was good.

In this way, the present study aimed: (1) to determine whether an elastography technique called Supersonic Shear Imaging (SSI) could be used to estimate muscle force, (2) to compare this estimation to that one provided by surface electromyography (EMG), and (3) to determine the effect of the pennation of muscle fibers on the accuracy of the estimation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Eleven subjects participated in two experimental sessions; one was devoted to the <b>shear</b> elastic <b>modulus</b> measurements and the other was devoted to the EMG recordings. Each session consisted in: (1) two smooth linear torque ramps from 0 to 60 % and from 0 to 30 % of maximal voluntary contraction, for the first dorsal interosseous and the abductor digiti minimi, respectively (referred to as "ramp contraction"); (2) two contractions done with the instruction to freely change the torque (referred to as "random changes contraction"). Multi-channel surface EMG recordings were obtained from a linear array of eight electrodes and the <b>shear</b> elastic <b>modulus</b> was measured using SSI. For ramp contractions, significant linear relationships were reported between EMG activity level and torque (R²  =  0. 949 ± 0. 036), and between <b>shear</b> elastic <b>modulus</b> and torque (R²  =  0. 982 ± 0. 013). SSI provided significant lower RMS(deviation) between measured torque and estimated torque than EMG activity level for both types of contraction (1. 4 ± 0. 7 vs. 2. 8 ± 1. 4 % of maximal voluntary contraction for "ramp contractions", p< 0. 01; 4. 5 ± 2. 3 vs. 7. 9 ± 5. 9 % of MVC for "random changes contractions", p< 0. 05).
