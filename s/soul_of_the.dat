2500|$|The Egyptian god Hor, {{living in}} the second century BCE {{suggests}} the purpose underlying <b>the</b> practice <b>of</b> mummifying animals: [...] "The benefit [...] which is performed for <b>the</b> Ibis, <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Toth, <b>the</b> greatest one, is made for the Hawk also, <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Ptah, <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Apis, <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Pre, <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Shu, <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Tefnut, <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Geb, <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Osiris, <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Isis, <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Nephtys, <b>the</b> great gods <b>of</b> Egypt, <b>the</b> Ibis and the Hawk." [...] Hor believes that the mummies are <b>the</b> <b>souls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gods: he describes the ibis as <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> Toth and <b>the</b> hawk as <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> many different gods. That is to say, some animals were, or contained, a ba- a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>soul</b> that is an active agents in this world and the spiritual world. Therefore, votive animal mummies are the animals' souls acted as messengers between people on earth and the gods.|$|R

Many graves of Jewish holy men are constructed with special apertures for the insertion of kvitelach.|$|E

5|$|The {{ceremony}} is often held weeks, months, or {{years after the}} death so that the deceased's family can raise the significant funds needed to cover funeral expenses. Torajans traditionally believe that death is not a sudden, abrupt event, but a gradual process toward Puya (the land of souls, or afterlife). During the waiting period, {{the body of the}} deceased is wrapped in several layers of cloth and kept under the tongkonan. The <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased is thought to linger around the village until the funeral {{ceremony is}} completed, after which it begins its journey to Puya.|$|E

50|$|Ghosts {{reported}} in medieval Europe tended {{to fall into}} two categories: <b>the</b> <b>souls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead, or demons. <b>The</b> <b>souls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead returned for a specific purpose. Demonic ghosts existed only to torment or tempt the living. The living could tell them apart by demanding their purpose in <b>the</b> name <b>of</b> Jesus Christ. <b>The</b> <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> a dead person would divulge their mission, while a demonic ghost would be banished at <b>the</b> sound <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Holy Name.|$|R

5|$|Alongside his {{stand-alone}} illustrations, in July 1926 Hergé began {{production of}} a comic strip for Le Boy-Scout Belge, Les Aventures de Totor (The Adventures of Totor), which continued intermittent publication until 1929. Revolving around the adventures of a Boy Scout patrol leader, the comic initially featured written captions underneath the scenes, but Hergé began to experiment with other forms of conveying information, including speech bubbles. Illustrations were also published in Le Blé qui lève (The Wheat That Grows) and other publications of the Catholic Association of Belgian Young People, and Hergé produced a book jacket for Weverbergh's novel, The <b>Soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sea. Being young and inexperienced, still learning his craft, Hergé sought guidance from an older cartoonist, Pierre Ickx, and together they founded the short-lived Atelier de la Fleur de Lys (AFL), an organisation for Christian cartoonists.|$|E
5|$|Funerary poems {{were thought}} to {{preserve}} a monarch's soul in death. The Pyramid Texts are the earliest surviving religious literature incorporating poetic verse. These texts do not appear in tombs or pyramids originating before the reign of Unas (r. 2375–2345 BC), who had the Pyramid of Unas built at Saqqara. The Pyramid Texts are chiefly concerned with the function of preserving and nurturing the <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sovereign in the afterlife. This aim eventually included safeguarding both the sovereign and his subjects in the afterlife. A variety of textual traditions evolved from the original Pyramid Texts: the Coffin Texts of the Middle Kingdom, the so-called Book of the Dead, Litany of Ra, and Amduat written on papyri from the New Kingdom {{until the end of}} ancient Egyptian civilization.|$|E

5|$|Nevinson, {{alongside}} Edward Elgar and H.G. Wells represented British {{culture at}} the celebrations of {{the first anniversary of}} the Republic of Czechoslovakia in Prague in 1919. Nevinson first visited New York in May 1919 and spent a month there while his World War One prints were being shown, to great acclaim, at the Frederick Keppel & Co gallery. A second exhibition at the same venue in October 1920 was poorly received. This led to Nevinson becoming disillusioned with New York, to the extent he changed the name of his painting New York-an abstraction to The <b>Soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soulless City. Nevinson claimed to have been the first artist to depict New York in a modernist style but in fact several British avant-garde artists had painted in the city before World War One. In May 1919, while Nevinson was in America, Kathleen Nevinson gave birth to a baby son, but the child died shortly later and before his father could return to Britain.|$|E
5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to be born with some physical peculiarity, such as a caul, little wings or membranes beneath his armpits, a tail or teeth; or he was born an orphan. There were practices intended to preserve the supernatural power of the newborn dragon. In the region of Veles, Macedonia, twelve girls would pick cotton, spin yarn from it, weave a cloth from the yarn, made a shirt from the cloth, and finally dress the dragon boy in the shirt. As thought in the region of Leskovac, Serbia, such a boy would only then become able to defeat an ala, when three old women spun yarn, knitted a shirt, and dressed the child in it. All this had to be done in one day and one night, during which time the three women should not have spoken a single word. A similar custom was recorded in western Bulgaria, where it was also believed that the <b>soul</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boy, while he slept in his cradle, left his body and walked around. If he was turned, he would die, as his soul could not return into his body.|$|E
