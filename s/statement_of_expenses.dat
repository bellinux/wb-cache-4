Based on the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenses</b> at the Ministry of Economy and Finance a time series has been designed. The period taken into account ranges from 1 st January 1871 to 30 th June 1940. The time series analysis shows that between 1926 and 1940 the public works expenditure was the highest (in absolute terms) amongst periods of equal length. However, due to the faster growth of the total public expenditure, the amount allocated to public works was significantly lower compared to the same amount during the so-called Età Giolittiana (1901 - 1914) and especially during the left-wing governments from 1876 to 1895...|$|E

Using confidential data from tax credit syndicators, I model the market price of a tax credit {{as a function of the}} existence of the guarantee, controlling for foreclosure risk on the underlying real estate. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that an econom-ically significant amount of the guarantee fee is paid by corporate investors for the right to use an accounting method that avoids reductions in pre-tax earnings...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} ofthe {{research is}} to reinstate value added accounting in a capital market context to judge corporate performance and corporate strategy. The thesis uses a value added format to deconstruct return on capital employed (ROCE) and reviews how income percolates down a value added statement to the bottom line. As expenses are collected by their 'nature' this approach avoids the arbitrariness associated with categorising expenses by 'function'. In addition corporate performance is presented in a pyramid structure offmancial key ratios which enables the. addition ofa capit. al market dimension, an important consideration when fIrms and their managers are under pressUre to I deliver shareholder value. The framework is used to construct a dataset offIrms listed in the main European stock.. market indices (FTSElOO, CAC 40 and DAX 30), to make similarities and differences of /. fmancial ratios visible at the macro, meso and micro level. As such {{it is possible to}} judge' performance and managerial priorities as well as position individual fIrms, as done in the case study, into a quintile distribu~ion. The case study also reviews strategic narratives for the case fIrms and make a more detailed fmancial analysis th. an possible for the Europe 170, which makes visible the strength of aligning'narratives with numbers. The contribution to knowledge, besides the dataset itself, is related to the usefulness ofthe value added accounting format in relation to capital markets by: ??????????

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the present}} paper we carry out a revision, on a {{theoretical}} level, of the principal aspects that have a major influence in the international accounting harmonization process and which are the principal differences in the income statement in the different Spanish general accounting plans and {{the differences between the}} income statement in the International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) for Small and Medium-sized Entities (SMEs) and in the General Spanish Accounting Plan 2007 for SMEs. During of the development of the paper we have analyzed the international accounting regulation and the pgc in relation to the SMEs that we think that they are fundamental in all the countries. We consider a first stage in which the directives were issued and the national regulations adapted to them. In Order to analyzing the different changes that have taken place the income statement along the history from the General Accounting Plan (GAP) from 1973 to 2007 in Spain. With the approval of the GAP Spain embarked upon the modern-day trend of accounting standardization. Summarizing in relation to the income statement we could have observed that there exist significant differences between both regulations being the most important is that in the IFRS for SMEs an entity either a single <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> comprehensive income for the reporting period displaying all items <b>of</b> income and <b>expense</b> recognized during the period including those items recognized in determining profit or loss (which is a subtotal in the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> comprehensive income) and items of other comprehensive income, or a separate income statement and a separate <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> comprehensive income. If an entity chooses to present both an income statement and a <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> comprehensive income, the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> comprehensive income begins with profit or loss and then displays the items of other comprehensive income and in the General Spanish Accounting Plan 2007 for SMEs in a single income statement where the expenses are aggregated in the <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> comprehensive income according to their nature. By the IFRS for SMEs an entity shall present an analysis <b>of</b> <b>expenses</b> using classification based on either the nature <b>of</b> <b>expenses</b> or the function <b>of</b> <b>expenses</b> within the entity, whichever provides information that is reliable and more relevant.
