5|$|One major anomaly {{remained}} in the railway's operations: the 1889 Regulation of Railways Act had required, amongst other measures, that all British passenger trains be fitted with continuous brakes. McConnel had secured an exemption for the Talyllyn Railway, {{on the basis that}} the low <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> meant they were unnecessary and that the cost of compliance would bankrupt the enterprise, {{but by the end of}} the 1990s the Railway Inspectorate was insisting that the Talyllyn be brought into compliance with the act, a little over 100years after it had passed. By 2001, the railway had fitted its entire passenger fleet with the necessary equipment, operated by air brake pumps mounted on the locomotives.|$|E
25|$|ENIAC had 20 ten-digit signed accumulators, {{which used}} ten's {{complement}} representation and could perform 5000 simple addition or subtraction operations between {{any of them}} and a source (e.g., another accumulator or a constant transmitter) every second. It was possible to connect several accumulators to run simultaneously, so the peak <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> was potentially much higher, due to parallel operation.|$|E
25|$|The next {{improvement}} was the Baudot code of 1874. French engineer Émile Baudot patented a printing telegraph {{in which the}} signals were translated automatically into typographic characters. Each character was assigned a unique code based on the sequence of just five contacts. Operators had to maintain a steady rhythm, and the usual <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> was 30 words per minute.|$|E
40|$|A pressure-actuated {{shaft seal}} {{assembly}} and associated method for controlling {{the flow of}} fluid adjacent a rotatable shaft are provided. The seal assembly includes one or more seal members that can be adjusted between open and closed positions, for example, according to the rotational <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the shaft. For example, the seal member can be configured to be adjusted according to a radial pressure differential in a fluid that varies with the rotational <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> the shaft. In addition, in the closed position, each seal member can contact a rotatable member connected to the shaft to form a seal with the rotatable member and prevent fluid from flowing through the assembly. Thus, the seal can be closed at low <b>speeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation</b> and opened at high <b>speeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> thereby reducing the heat and wear in the seal assembly while maintaining a sufficient seal during all <b>speeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental {{results of the}} real-time performance of model-based control algorithms. We compare the computed-torque scheme which utilizes the complete dynamics model of the manipulator with the independent joint control scheme which assumes a decoupled and linear model of the manipulator dynamics. The two manipulator control schemes have been implemented on the CMU DD Arm I 1 with a sampling period of 2 ms. We discuss the design of controller gains for both the computed-torque and the independent joint control schemes and establish a framework for comparing their trajectory tracking performance Our investigation shows that the computed-torque scheme outperforms the independent joint control scheme {{as long as there}} is no torque saturation in the actuators. Based on our experimental results, we conclusively establish the importance of compensating for the nonlinear Coriolis and centrifugal forces even at low <b>speeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation.</b> This represents an important result because it serves to resolve the controversy about the need to compensate for these forces at low <b>speeds</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Integrated {{circuit design}} {{involves}} {{the creation of}} electronic components, such as transistors, resistors, capacitors and the metallic interconnect of these components onto a piece of semiconductor, typically silicon. A method to isolate the individual components formed in the substrate is necessary since the substrate silicon is conductive and often forms an active region of the individual components. The two common methods are p-n junction isolation and dielectric isolation. [...] Attention {{must be given to}} power dissipation of transistors and interconnect resistances and current density of the interconnect, contacts and vias since ICs contain very tiny devices compared to discrete components, where such concerns are less of an issue. Electromigration in metallic interconnect and ESD damage to the tiny components are also of concern. Finally, the physical layout of certain circuit subblocks is typically critical, in order to achieve the desired <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>operation,</b> to segregate noisy portions of an IC from quiet portions, to balance the effects of heat generation across the IC, or to facilitate the placement of connections to circuitry outside the IC.|$|E
2500|$|Even as {{the pool}} of workers shrank, demand for outputs {{continued}} to grow rapidly. As a result, the Soviet government pushed the Gulag to [...] "do more with less". With fewer able-bodied workers and few supplies from outside the camp system, camp administrators {{had to find a}} way to maintain production. The solution they found was to push the remaining prisoners still harder. The NKVD employed a system of setting unrealistically high production goals, straining resources in an attempt to encourage higher productivity. As the Axis armies pushed into Soviet territory from June 1941 on, labor resources became further strained, and many of the camps had to evacuate out of Western Russia. From the beginning of the war to halfway through 1944, 40 camps were set up, and 69 were disbanded. During evacuations, machinery received priority, leaving prisoners to reach safety on foot. The <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>Operation</b> Barbarossa's advance prevented the evacuation of all laborers in good time, and the NKVD massacred many to prevent them from falling into German hands. While this practice denied the Germans a source of free labor, it also further restricted the Gulag's capacity to keep up with the Red Army's demands. When the tide of the war turned, however, and the Soviets started pushing the Axis invaders back, fresh batches of laborers replenished the camps. As the Red Army recaptured territories from the Germans, an influx of Soviet ex-POWs greatly increased the Gulag population.|$|E

In some cases it was realized that there was a space-time trade-off, whereby a task could be handled either by using a fast algorithm which used quite a lot of working memory, or by using a slower algorithm which used very little working memory. The engineering trade-off was then to use the fastest algorithm which would fit in the available memory.|$|R
