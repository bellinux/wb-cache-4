Optical <b>streak</b> <b>cameras</b> {{are an integral part}} of the experimental diagnostics instrumentation. To accurately reduce data from the <b>streak</b> <b>cameras</b> a temporal calibration is required.

50|$|In {{addition}} to framing tubes, these tubes {{could also be}} configured {{with one or two}} sets of deflector plates in one axis. As light was converted to photoelectrons, these photoelectrons could be swept across the phosphor screen at incredible sweep speeds limited only by the sweep electronics, to generate the first electronic <b>streak</b> <b>cameras.</b> With no moving parts, sweep speeds of up to 10 picoseconds per mm could be attained, thus giving technical time resolution of several picoseconds. As early as the 1973-74 there were commercial <b>streak</b> <b>cameras</b> capable of 3 picosecond time resolution derived from the need to evaluate the ultra short laser pulses which were being developed at that time. Electronic <b>streak</b> <b>cameras</b> are still used today with time resolution as short as sub picoseconds, and are the only true way to measure short optical events in the picosecond time scale.|$|R

50|$|In December 2011, a {{research}} group at MIT reported a combined {{implementation of the}} laser (stroboscopic) and <b>streak</b> <b>camera</b> applications to capture images of a repetitive event that can be reassembled to create a trillion-frame-per-second video. This rate of image acquisition, which enables the capture of images of moving photons, is possible {{by the use of}} the <b>streak</b> <b>camera</b> to collect each field of view rapidly in narrow single streak images. Illuminating a scene with a laser that emits pulses of light every 13 nanoseconds, synchronized to the <b>streak</b> <b>camera</b> with repeated sampling and positioning, researchers have demonstrated collection of one-dimensional data which can be computationally compiled into a two-dimensional video. Although this approach is limited by time resolution to repeatable events, stationary applications such as medical ultrasound or industrial material analysis are possibilities.|$|E

50|$|The time-resolution of {{the best}} {{optoelectronic}} <b>streak</b> <b>cameras</b> is around 180 femtoseconds. Measurement of pulses shorter than this duration requires other techniques such as optical autocorrelation and frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG).|$|R

50|$|Unlike {{attosecond}} and femtosecond pulses, {{the duration}} of pulses on the nanosecond timescale are slow enough to be measured through electronic means. <b>Streak</b> <b>cameras</b> translate the temporal profile of pulses into that of a spatial profile; that is, photons that arrive on the detector at different times arrive at different locations on the detector.|$|R
50|$|A <b>streak</b> <b>camera</b> is an {{instrument}} for measuring the variation in a pulse of light's intensity with time. They are {{used to measure the}} pulse duration of some ultrafast laser systems and for applications such as time-resolved spectroscopy and LIDAR.|$|E

40|$|A {{device to}} measure the {{propagation}} speeds of cloud-to-ground lightning has been developed. The lightning propagation speed (LPS) device consists of eight solid state silicon photodetectors mounted behind precision horizontal slits in the focal plane of a 50 -mm lens on a 35 -mm camera. Although the LPS device produces results similar to those obtained from a <b>streaking</b> <b>camera,</b> the LPS device has the advantages of smaller size, lower cost, mobile use, and easier data collection and analysis. The maximum accuracy for the LPS is 0. 2 microsec, compared with about 0. 8 microsecs for the <b>streaking</b> <b>camera.</b> It is found that the return stroke propagation speed for triggered lightning is different than that for natural lightning if measurements are taken over channel segments less than 500 m. It is suggested {{that there are no}} significant differences between the propagation speeds of positive and negative flashes. Also, differences between natural and triggered dart leaders are discussed...|$|R

These developments are the availability of firstly, high brightness third-generation x-ray sources, secondly, passively mode-locked lasers with 100 fs temporal duration and thirdly, averaging <b>streak</b> <b>cameras</b> with sub-picosecond temporal resolution. In this paper, we discuss how these novel devices are combined in time-resolved x-ray diffraction experiments at synchrotron radiation facilities...|$|R
50|$|The quantum Boltzmann {{equation}} {{has been}} verified by direct comparison to time-resolved experimental measurements, {{and in general}} has found much use in semiconductor optics.

50|$|A <b>streak</b> <b>camera</b> {{operates}} by {{transforming the}} time variations {{of a light}} pulse into a spatial profile on a detector, by causing a time-varying deflection of the light across {{the width of the}} detector. A light pulse enters the instrument through a narrow slit along one direction gets deflected in the perpendicular direction so that photons that arrive first hit the detector at a different position compared to photons that arrive later.|$|E
50|$|A {{picosecond}} is an SI {{unit of time}} {{equal to}} 10âˆ’12 or 1/1,000,000,000,000 of a second. That is one trillionth, or one millionth of one millionth of a second, or 0.000 000 000 001 seconds. A picosecond is to one second as one second is to 31,710 years. Multiple technical approaches achieve imaging within single-digit picoseconds: for example, the <b>streak</b> <b>camera</b> or intensified CCD (ICCD) cameras are able to picture the motion of light.|$|E

Here, we are describing a pump-probe technique that can be employed to measure events where detector resolution is insufficient to resolve the event. The scheme utilizes a diamond plate as an x-ray transducer and a p-polarized probe beam...|$|R
40|$|Abstract â€“ Increasingly, ADC {{technology}} is being {{pressed into service}} for single-shot instrumentation applications that were formerly served by vacuum-tube based oscilloscopes and <b>streak</b> <b>cameras.</b> ADC technology, while convenient, suffers significant performance impairments. Thus, in these demanding applications, a quantitative and accurate representation of these impairments is critical {{to an understanding of}} measurement accuracy. We have developed a phase-plane behavioral model, implemented it in SIMULINK and applied it to interleaved, high-speed ADCs (up to 4 gigasamples/sec). We have also developed and demonstrated techniques to effectively compensate for these impairments based upon the model...|$|R
50|$|The <b>streak</b> <b>camera,</b> {{used for}} {{diagnostics}} in laser fusion, plasma radiation, and combustion, operates in burst mode only (providing just several frames) and requires synchronization {{of the camera}} with the event to be captured. It is therefore unable to capture random or transient events in biological systems. Stroboscopes have a complementary role: they can capture the dynamics of fast eventsâ€”but only if the event is repetitive, such as rotations, vibrations, and oscillations. They are unable to capture non-repetitive random events that occur only once or do not occur at regular intervals.|$|E
5000|$|George Squier {{wrote and}} edited many books and {{articles}} {{on the subject of}} radio and electricity. An inventor, he and Dartmouth professor Albert Cushing Crehore developed a magneto-optical <b>streak</b> <b>camera</b> [...] "The Polarizing Photo-chronograph" [...] in 1896 to measure the speed of projectiles both inside a cannon and directly after they left the cannon barrel. This was one of the earliest photonic programs. They also worked to develop synchronous AC telegraphic systems.

5000|$|In their publications, Raskar's team {{claims to}} be able to capture {{exposures}} so short that light only traverses 0.6 mm (corresponding to 2 picoseconds, or 2x10âˆ’12 seconds) during the exposure period, a figure that is in agreement with the nominal resolution of the Hamamatsu <b>streak</b> <b>camera</b> model C5680, on which their experimental setup is based. Recordings taken using the setup have reached significant spread in the mainstream media, including a presentation by Raskar at TEDGlobal 2012 Furthermore, the team was able to demonstrate the reconstruction of unknown objects [...] "around corners", i.e., outside the line of sight of light source and camera, from femto-photographs.|$|E
40|$|The present {{device for}} {{lightning}} channel propagation-velocity determination employs eight photodetectors mounted behind precision horizontal slits in the focal plane of a photographic camera lens.

50|$|Multiphoton intrapulse {{interference}} phase scan (MIIPS) is {{a method}} used in ultrashort laser technology that simultaneously measures (phase characterization), and compensates (phase correction) femtosecond laser pulses using an adaptive pulse shaper. When an ultrashort laser pulse reaches a duration of less than a few hundred femtosecond, it becomes critical to characterize its duration, its temporal intensity curve, or its electric field {{as a function of}} time. Classical photodetectors measuring the intensity of light are still too slow to allow for a direct measurement, even with the fastest photodiodes or <b>streak</b> <b>cameras.</b>|$|R
40|$|By {{operating}} SPEAR 3 in low-{alpha} mode {{the storage}} ring can generate synchrotron radiation pulses of order 1 ps. Applications include pump-probe x-ray {{science and the}} production of THz radiation in the CSR regime. Measurements of the bunch length are difficult, however, because the light intensity is low and <b>streak</b> <b>cameras</b> typically provide resolution of only a few ps. Tests are now underway to resolve the short bunch length using cross-correlation between a 60 -fs Ti:Sapphire laser and the visible SR beam in a BBO crystal. In this paper we report on the experimental setup, preliminary measurements and prospects for further improvement...|$|R
5000|$|Femto-photography is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} a technique for recording the propagation of ultrashort pulses of light through a scene {{at a very high}} speed. A femto-photograph is equivalent to an optical impulse response of a scene and has also been denoted by terms such as a light-in-flight recording or transient image. Femto-photography of macroscopic objects was first demonstrated using a holographic process in the 1970s by Nils Abramsson at the Royal Institute of Technology (Sweden). [...] A research team at the MIT Media Lab led by Ramesh Raskar, together with contributors from the Graphics and Imaging Lab at the Universidad de Zaragoza, Spain, more recently achieved a significant increase in image quality using a <b>streak</b> <b>camera</b> synchronized to a pulsed laser and modified to obtain 2D images instead of just a single scanline.|$|E
50|$|Light {{was first}} {{captured}} in its flight by N. Abramson in 1978, {{who used a}} holographic technique to record the wavefront of a pulse propagating and being scattered by a white-painted screen placed in its path. This high-speed recording technique allowed the dynamic observation of light phenomena like reflection, interference and focusing that are normally observed statically. More recently, light-in-flight holography has been performed in a scattering medium rather than using a reflective screen. Light can also be captured in motion in a scattering medium using a <b>streak</b> <b>camera</b> that has picosecond temporal resolution, thus removing the need for interferometry and coherent illumination but requires additional hardware to raster scan the two-dimensional (2D) scene, which increases the acquisition time to hours. A few other techniques possess the temporal resolution to observe light in motion as it illuminates a scene, such as photonic mixer devices based on modulated illumination, albeit with a temporal resolution limited to a few nanoseconds. Alternatively, time-encoded amplified imaging can record images at the repetition rate of a laser by exploiting wavelength-encoded illumination of a scene and amplified detection through a dispersive fibre, albeit with 160â€‰ns temporal and spatial resolution. Recent studies based on computer tomography using data from multiple probe pulses enabled reconstruction of picosecond pulse propagation phenomena in condensed media. In 2015 a method to visualize events evolving on picosecond time scales based on single-photon detector arrays has been demonstrated.|$|E

40|$|Optical {{diagnostics}} {{are currently}} being designed to analyze high-energy density physics experiments at the National Ignition Facility (NIF). Two independent line-imaging Velocity Interferometer System for Any Reflector (VISAR) interferometers have been fielded to measure shock velocities, breakout times, and emission of targets having sizes of 1 â€“ 5 mm. An 8 -inch-diameter, fused silica triplet lens collects light at f/ 3 inside the 30 -foot-diameter NIF vacuum chamber. VISAR recordings use a 659. 5 -nm probe laser. By adding a specially coated beam splitter to the interferometer table, light at wavelengths from 540 to 645 nm is spilt into a thermal-imaging diagnostic. Because fused silica lenses {{are used in the}} first triplet relay, the intermediate image planes for different wavelengths separate by considerable distances. A corrector lens on the interferometer table reunites these separated wavelength planes to provide a good image. Thermal imaging collects light at f/ 5 from a 2 -mm object placed at Target Chamber Center (TCC). <b>Streak</b> <b>cameras</b> perform VISAR and thermal-imaging recording. All optical lenses are on kinematic mounts so that pointing accuracy of the optical axis may be checked. Counter-propagating laser beams (orange and red) are used to align both diagnostics. The red alignment laser is selected to be at the 50 percent reflection point of the beam splitter. This alignment laser is introduced at the recording <b>streak</b> <b>cameras</b> for both diagnostics and passes through this special beam splitter on its way into the NIF vacuum chamber...|$|R
40|$|Radiation {{temperature}} {{is an important}} parameter in characterizing the properties of hot plasmas. In most cases this {{temperature is}} time varying caused by the short lived and/or time dependent nature of the plasma. Thus, a measurement of the radiation flux {{as a function of}} time is quite valuable. To this end the authors have developed a spectrometer that can acquire spectra with a time resolution of less than 1 ns and covers the spectral energy range from {approximately} 60 to 1, 000 eV. The spectrometer consists of an entrance slit placed relatively near the plasma, a thin gold film transmission grating with aperture, a micro channel plate (MCP) detector with a gold cathode placed at the dispersion plane and an electron lens to focus the electrons from the MCP onto a phosphor coated fiber optic plug. The phosphor (In:CdS) has a response time of {approximately} 500 ps. This detector system, including the fast phosphor is similar to one that has been previously described. The spectrometer is in a vacuum chamber that is turbo pumped to a base pressure of {approximately} 5 x 10 {sup 7 } torr. The light from the phosphor is coupled to two <b>streak</b> <b>cameras</b> through 100 m long fiber optic cables.
