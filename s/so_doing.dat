5|$|The society {{introduced}} the world's first journal exclusively devoted to science in 1665, Philosophical Transactions, and in <b>so</b> <b>doing</b> originated the peer review process now widespread in scientific journals.

5|$|Delacroix's figure wears a pileus, and Bartholdi {{at first}} {{considered}} placing {{one on his}} figure as well. Instead, he used a diadem, or crown, to top its head. In <b>so</b> <b>doing,</b> he avoided a reference to Marianne, who invariably wears a pileus. The seven rays form a halo or aureole. They evoke the sun, the seven seas, and the seven continents, and represent another means, besides the torch, whereby Liberty enlightens the world.|$|E
5|$|In July 2015, {{the company}} {{announced}} that it would open terminals in Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo, Mexico, and begin services between the two cities with onward schedules to existing terminals in Texas. In <b>so</b> <b>doing,</b> Greyhound claimed to be the first American bus company to operate an intra-Mexican route. In September 2015, Greyhound announced expanded service in Missouri and Kansas shortly after Megabus {{announced that it would}} be ending service to several cities and college campuses.|$|E
5|$|After a fight, Storm Shadow and the Baroness {{retrieve}} the warheads {{and take them}} to Baron DeCobray, the Baroness's husband, for him to weaponize. Making their way to Paris, the Joes pursue the Baroness and Storm Shadow, but are unsuccessful in stopping them from launching one of the missiles. The missile hits the Eiffel Tower and releases the nanomites in it, destroying the tower and some of the surrounding area before Duke manages to hit the kill switch. However, in <b>so</b> <b>doing,</b> he is captured and taken to McCullen's base under the Arctic.|$|E

5|$|As I {{made clear}} in my {{telegram}} to the FIDE delegates, the match conditions I proposed were non-negotiable. Mr. Cramer informs {{me that the}} rules of the winner being the first player to win ten games, draws not counting, unlimited number of games and if nine wins to nine match is drawn with champion regaining title and prize fund split equally were rejected by the FIDE delegates. By <b>so</b> <b>doing</b> FIDE has decided against my participation in the 1975 World Chess Championship. Therefore, I resign my FIDE World Chess Championship title. Sincerely, Bobby Fischer.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{dodged the}} issue during the campaign, which he won in 1825, {{but once he}} took office, {{he had to come}} down on one side or the other. He voted in favor of the Old Court, {{reflecting}} his upper-class status and affinity for the establishment. In <b>so</b> <b>doing,</b> he identified himself with the party of Kentucky's favorite son, Henry Clay. The Whigs would control Kentucky politics for the next twenty-five years. In 1826, the majority of the General Assembly sided with the Old Court and abolished the New Court.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War, Turing {{worked for}} the Government Code and Cypher School (GC) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that {{produced}} Ultra intelligence. For a time he led Hut 8, the section which was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis. Here he devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish bombe method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine. Turing {{played a pivotal role}} in cracking intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Nazis in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic, and in <b>so</b> <b>doing</b> helped win the war.|$|E

5|$|Hazel: The protagonist, Fiver's brother; {{he leads}} the rabbits from Sandleford and {{eventually}} becomes Chief Rabbit. Though Hazel is not particularly large or powerful, he is loyal, brave, and a quick thinker. He sees the good in each individual, and what they bring to the table; in <b>so</b> <b>doing,</b> he makes sure that no one gets left behind, thus earning the respect and loyalty of his warren. He often relies on Fiver's advice, and trusts in his brother's instincts immensely.|$|E
5|$|He {{became a}} United States citizen in 1946 after {{serving in the}} United States Army and {{achieving}} the rank of sergeant. In <b>so</b> <b>doing,</b> he lost his Canadian citizenship, as Canadian law prior to 1977 limited dual citizenship. After the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941 he attempted {{to sign up for}} active duty with the army's flying service (the United States Air Force was not formed until 1947), but was turned down for being too old. He therefore spent World War II in the United States Army and among his duty stations was Fort Lewis, located in Tacoma, Washington.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases where}} there was {{unconscious}} guilt associated with the relationship, the wish for reunion may be subverted by anxiety. This may lead to repression, which Sigmund Freud had linked {{with the development of}} morbid dread. Jones surmised in this case the original wish of a (sexual) reunion may be drastically changed: desire is replaced by fear; love is replaced by sadism, and the object or loved one is replaced by an unknown entity. The sexual aspect {{may or may not be}} present. Some modern critics have proposed a simpler theory: People identify with immortal vampires because, by <b>so</b> <b>doing,</b> they overcome, or at least temporarily escape from, their fear of dying.|$|E

5|$|In {{the face}} of a looming crisis in his career, Wills {{admitted}} to throwing in his 1870–71 Australian Cricketers' Guide, and in <b>so</b> <b>doing</b> taunted his enemies to stop him. Nonetheless, he was made Victoria XI captain for the March 1871 intercolonial against New South Wales, held at the Albert Ground. Wills' first innings top score of 39* was offset by his drunken behaviour in the field and his apparent reluctance to bowl for fear of being called. Victoria won by 48 runs. Not long after, Wills was no-balled for throwing {{for the first time in}} a club match. Rumour spread that the umpire had conspired against him with the opposing club's owner.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1852, McClellan {{published}} a manual on bayonet tactics that he had translated from the original French. He also received an assignment to the Department of Texas, with orders to perform a survey of Texas rivers and harbors. In 1853 he participated in the Pacific Railroad surveys, ordered by Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, to select an appropriate route for the planned transcontinental railroad. McClellan surveyed the western portion of the northern corridor along the 47th and 49th parallels from St. Paul to the Puget Sound. In <b>so</b> <b>doing</b> he demonstrated a tendency for insubordination toward senior political figures. Isaac Stevens, governor of the Washington Territory, became dissatisfied with McClellan's performance in scouting passes across the Cascade Range. McClellan selected Yakima Pass without a thorough reconnaissance and refused the governor's order to lead a party through it in winter conditions, relying on faulty intelligence about the depth of snow pack in that area. In <b>so</b> <b>doing,</b> he missed three greatly superior passes in the near vicinity, {{which would be the}} ones eventually used for railroads and interstate highways. The governor ordered McClellan to turn over his expedition logbooks, but McClellan steadfastly refused, most likely because of embarrassing personal comments that he had made throughout.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} week of March, the {{battalion}} finally withdrew to refit with the M18 Hellcat self-propelled tank destroyer. In <b>so</b> <b>doing,</b> it reverted to the old self-propelled battalion organisation; three companies of twelve tank destroyers, plus a fourth reconnaissance company with a platoon of pioneers. The new organisation was smaller than the old - fewer men were needed for vehicle crews - and so even after the creation of the new Reconnaissance Company on 27 March, the 824th finished the month with a complement of 646 all ranks, down from 750.|$|E

5|$|In the {{moonlight}} of 3 October just before midnight Mansell {{was on the}} lookout for Spinola's galleys and were soon sighted. Mansell ordered an attack and off Dungeness; Moon, Samson and the Answer charged at the galleys. Spinola seeing this decided to swing his galleys round to face the South East, the direction of the Flanders coast but in <b>so</b> <b>doing</b> the lead ship San Felipe (St. Philip) ran straight into the Victory and Hope forcing the galleys inadvertently further East.|$|E
5|$|Nash {{trained with}} South Melbourne during the 1946 {{pre-season}} but ultimately retired from VFL football {{to accept a}} position as captain-coach of the Ovens and Murray Football League side Wangaratta for a salary of £12 per week, four times the wage he would have received playing for South Melbourne. The high wage also meant that Nash was not required to find additional employment to cover his family's expenses, and in <b>so</b> <b>doing,</b> {{became one of the}} first fully professional Australian rules football players.|$|E
5|$|On February 26, 2010, Butler {{traveled}} to Valparaiso for their regular season finale. Leading scorer Gordon Hayward was sidelined with lower back pain, {{but the team}} still won 74–69. In <b>so</b> <b>doing,</b> Stevens broke the coaching record he had tied the prior week and Butler completed an 18–0 undefeated conference schedule. It was Butler's first undefeated conference record since joining the Horizon League, and first since Joe Sexson led the 1978 team to a 6–0 record in the now defunct Indiana Collegiate Conference. Stevens earned his third straight regular-season conference championship.|$|E
