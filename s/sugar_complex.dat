40|$|The autocatalytic {{nature of}} the base catalyzed {{condensation}} of formaldehyde to formose sugars is eliminated by using as a cocatalyst, an aldose, or ketose having an alpha-hydrogen.

40|$|Compared {{to simple}} <b>sugars,</b> <b>complex</b> {{carbohydrates}} have been assumed invisible to taste. However, two recent studies proposed {{that there may}} be a perceivable taste quality elicited by complex carbohydrates independent of sweet taste. There is precedent with behavioural studies demonstrating that rats are very attracted to complex carbohydrates, and that complex carbohydrates are preferred to simple sugars at low concentrations. This suggests that rats may have independent taste sensors for simple <b>sugars</b> and <b>complex</b> carbohydrates. The aim of this paper is to investigate oral sensitivities of two different classes of complex carbohydrates (a soluble digestible and a soluble non-digestible complex carbohydrate), and to compare these to other caloric and non-nutritive sweeteners in addition to the prototypical tastes using two commonly used psychophysical measures. There were strong correlations between the detection thresholds and mean intensity ratings for complex carbohydrates (maltodextrin, oligofructose) (r = 0. 94, P 0. 05). However, moderate correlations were observed between perceived intensities of complex carbohydrates and sweeteners (r = 0. 48 - 0. 61, P < 0. 05). These data provide evidence that complex carbohydrates can be sensed in the oral cavity over a range of concentrations independent of sweet taste sensitivity at low concentrations, but with partial overlap with sweet taste intensity at higher concentrations...|$|R
40|$|In the 1700 s, French {{colonies in}} the Caribbean {{produced}} {{massive amounts of}} sugar cane for shipment exclusively to France. The French Revolution of 1789 precipitated long years of economic conflict between England and France, during which French scientists and entrepreneurs worked to develop technology and capital investment to produce sugar on the French mainland from European-grown beets. Economic and agricultural viability of mass production of beet sugar was established by 1812 and used to promote French autarky (self-sufficiency) in emerging ideologies of economic nationalism. Beet sugar's equivalence to cane sugar meant direct competition with colonial cane, marking a period of "conjunction," when questions of colonial belonging and rights to participation in markets were actively contested in Paris as debates over tariff and bounty legislation. New forms of symbolic inclusion and exclusion of French colonies were produced—with important results for the cane <b>sugar</b> <b>complex,</b> colonial producers, and the system of French trade relations. Guyane Française (French Guiana) provides the prime illustrative case of colonial changes due to the sugar conjunction. A colony in northeastern South America, Guyane had been claimed by France since the early seventeenth century, but remained sparsely populated and experienced relatively weak development of the cane <b>sugar</b> <b>complex.</b> Thus, during and following the sugar conjunction, the French moved to make the colony a place for exile of state prisoners, rather than continue to develop it for cane cultivation and sugar production.

40|$|Innate sensors play a {{critical}} role in the early innate immune responses to invading pathogens through sensing of diverse biochemical signatures also known as pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). These biochemical signatures primarily consist of a major family of biomolecules such as proteins, lipids, nitrogen bases, and sugar and its complexes, which are distinct from host molecules and exclusively expressed in pathogens and essential to their survival. The family of sensors known as pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) are germ-line encoded, evolutionarily conserved molecules and consist of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), C-type lectin-like receptors (CLRs), and DNA sensors. Sensing of PAMP by PRR initiates the cascade of signaling leading to the activation of transcription factors, such as NF-κB and interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), resulting in a variety of cellular responses, including the production of interferons (IFNs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this review, we discuss sensing of different types of glycosylated PAMPs such as -glucan (a polymeric sugar) or lipopolysaccharides, nucleic acid, and so on (<b>sugar</b> <b>complex</b> PAMPs) by different families of sensors, its role in pathogenesis, and its application in development of potential vaccine and vaccine adjuvants...|$|E
40|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) and {{reactive}} nitrogen species (RNS), saccharide (i. e. monosaccharide, disaccharide and polysaccharide), are continuously generated, transformed and {{consumed in the}} living systems. As a consequence of their significant value towards human health in aerobic life, {{it is very important}} and has drawn much attention in the chemical and biological sensing of the species. It is our long-standing interest in the recognition of monosaccharide (e. g. glucose) through exploration of various boronate-based fluorescence probes, thus, based on the previous work, we started on the design, synthesis and evaluation of novel fluorescent chemosensors for breakthrough discoveries in the detection of saccharide and ROS selectively and specifically, which are made up of different receptors and diverse singaling fluorophores, e. g. anthracene, coumarin, fluorescein, naphthalimine. Firstly, “integrated” and “insulated” boronate-based fluorescent probes (2 -naphthylboronic acid and N-Methyl-o-(aminomethyl) phenylboronic acid) have been evaluated for the detection of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of saccharides (i. e. D-fructose). In the presence of D-fructose the initial fluorescence intensity of the “insulated” system is much higher and produces a blue visible fluorescence. Based on the experimental observation above in the boronate-based systems (i. e. B-N bond protection), a new water-soluble boronate-based fluorescent probe was designed and evaluated for the detection of peroxynitrite (much stronger oxidant) in the presence of D-fructose. The enhanced fluorescence of probe when bound with D-fructose was switched off in the presence of peroxynitrite. While, other reactive oxygen/nitrogen species led to only slight fluorescence decreases due to protection by the internal N-B interaction. The interaction of probe with D-fructose not only strengthens the fluorescence signal, but also protects the boronic acid to oxidation by other ROS/RNS. Therefore, under conditions generating various ROS/RNS, the boronate-based <b>sugar</b> <b>complex</b> preferentially reacts with peroxynitrite (ONOO−). The sensor displays good “on-off” response towards peroxynitrite both in RAW 264. 7 cells and HeLa cells. A new ICT (internal charge transfer) sensing system was developed for the detection of hydrogen peroxide and peroxynitrite. The probe displayed an enhanced fluorescence change when bound with D-fructose due to the prolonged N-B distance. The fluorescence intensity of the probe dropped down both in the detection of H 2 O 2 and ONOO− which was attributed to the oxidation of arylboronic acid even though in the presence of D-fructose. Using the self-assembly of aromatic boronic acids with Alizarin Red S (ARS), we developed a new chemo/biosensor for the selective detection of peroxynitrite. Phenylboronic acid, benzoboroxole and 2 -(N, N-dimethylaminomethyl) phenylboronic acid were employed to bind with ARS to form the complex probes. In particular the ARS-NBA system with a high binding affinity can preferably react with peroxynitrite over hydrogen peroxide and hypochlorite due to the protection of the boron via the solvent-insertion B-N interaction. Our simple system produces a visible naked-eye colorimetric change and on-off fluorescence response towards peroxynitrite. By coupling a chemical reaction that leads to an indicator displacement, we have developed a new sensing strategy, referred to herein as RIA (Reaction-based Indicator displacement Assay). Next, we developed a novel class of simple materials for sensing monosaccharides by the functionalization of graphene oxide (GO) with boronate-based fluorescence probes. The composite materials were characterized by atomic force microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and UV-vis/fluorescence spectroscopy. The strong fluorescence of the fluorescence probes is quenched in the presence of GO through fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The BA@GO composite sensors formed provide a useful platform for fluorogenic detection of monosaccharides based on the strong affinity between the boronic acid receptor and monosaccharides. The BA@GO composite sensor displayed a “turn-on” fluorescence response with a good linear relationship towards fructose over a range of other saccharides. Next, new water-soluble copper (II) complex fluorescence probes were developed and evaluated for the detection of nitric oxide and nitroxyl in a physiological condition. A significant fluorescence “off-on” response displayed by using the copper (II) complex for the detection of NO and HNO (Na 2 N 2 O 3 as a donor). Under pathological conditions generating various ROS/RNS, the copper (II) complex fluorescent probe preferentially reacts with NO/HNO over other reactive oxygen species. The dual-analyte recognitions of the simple, sensitive probe were further applied in living cell for the exogenous NO/HNO. In the following work, we synthesised a phosphorous-based compound for the detection of HNO which derived from Angeli’s salt in a biological condition. Significantly, it displayed a high sensitivity and selectivity toward HNO over other various ROS species, especially NO since they have a similar chemical property. The underlying mechanism was attributed to the cleavage of C-O bond induced by Staudinger Ligation...|$|E
