50|$|In 1976, Nigel Desmond Norman, one of {{the founders}} of Britten-Norman, the {{manufacturers}} of the Islander, set up NDN Aircraft to build the Firecracker, a <b>single</b> piston <b>engined</b> trainer designed to replicate the handling of a jet trainer. It was intended that the Firecracker would be built under license by third world countries to help start up local aviation industries. As such the structure was simple. The first prototype, powered by a Lycoming O-540 piston engine flew on 26 May 1977.|$|R
25|$|The Northrop XFT was an American {{prototype}} fighter aircraft of the 1930s. A <b>single</b> <b>engined</b> low-winged monoplane, it {{was designed}} and built to meet a United States Navy order for an advanced carrier based fighter.

25|$|The Westland Weasel was a {{prototype}} British two-seat fighter/reconnaissance aircraft of the First World War. Designed {{to replace the}} Bristol Fighter, the Weasel was a <b>single</b> <b>engined</b> tractor biplane. Four prototypes were built, but no production followed owing {{to the failure of}} its original engine, although the prototypes were used as engine test beds for the successful Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar and Bristol Jupiter engines.|$|E
25|$|The Fisher R-80 Tiger Moth is a Canadian two-seat, {{conventional}} landing gear, <b>single</b> <b>engined,</b> biplane kit aircraft {{designed for}} construction by amateur builders.

50|$|The Liverpool-class {{lifeboat}} was a non {{self-righting boat}} {{operated by the}} Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) from its stations around {{the coast of the}} United Kingdom and Ireland. The boats were designed for carriage launching and there were two types built, <b>single</b> and twin <b>engined.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Sturgeon was a <b>singled</b> <b>engined,</b> three-seat <b>single</b> bay biplane, {{with wings}} of mild sweep. They had {{parallel}} chord and equal span, but the lower {{one had a}} slightly smaller chord than the upper, giving the appearance of stagger though the trailing edges were in line. Another consequence {{of the difference in}} chord was that the front steel interplane struts leant slightly forwards, whilst the rear one was upright. Apart from their fabric covering the wings were entirely duralumin structures. There were push rod connected ailerons on both top and bottom wings. The Sturgeon was a ship-board aircraft and so its wings folded to save space. A thickened centre section held fuel tanks and was supported by two sets of roughly N shaped struts to the upper fuselage. A wide, V-shape cut out in the upper trailing edge went forward to the rear spar to enhance the view from the cockpits, which was helped by the wide interplane gap that put the upper wing well clear of the fuselage. The lower wing was also braced near its root by a pair of struts from each wing spar, fore and aft, to a common point on the fuselage above {{the leading edge of the}} wing.|$|R
50|$|The Leyland Lion, {{coded as}} PSR1, was a bus chassis {{manufactured}} by Leyland {{as its first}} production rear <b>engined</b> <b>single</b> decker. A total of 88 were built between 1960 and 1967, which was low for the time. It was the third of five Leyland bus models to carry the Lion brand.|$|R
25|$|In West Cornwall {{the main}} threat was from low level 'hit and run' raids by <b>single</b> <b>engined</b> Luftwaffe {{aircraft}} (such as attacks by pairs of Focke-Wulf Fw 190s on St Ives on 28 August and Truro on 7 September), which were difficult for HAA guns to engage. Night raids on Truro on 24 September and on Penzance two nights later were engaged by the regiment with both HAA and light machine guns.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was a <b>single</b> <b>engined</b> pusher biplane, with folding, single-bay wings and a T-tail. It had a streamlined wooden hull with the pilot's cockpit {{located in the}} nose. The first prototype, serial number N59 flew in February 1918, powered by a 200hp (149kW) Hispano-Suiza 8 engine. It was later fitted with a Sunbeam Arab of similar power. By this time, however, the Royal Naval Air Service was operating Sopwith Pup landplanes from flying off platforms aboard ships, {{and the success of}} the Pup (and later the Sopwith Camel) lead to the abandonment of the N.1B programme. The second prototype was delivered as spare parts to support testing of the first prototype, while the third was not completed.|$|E
25|$|There {{were also}} threebased aircraft, {{all of which}} were <b>single</b> <b>engined,</b> and two enplanement {{passenger}} boardings as of 2011. Updated statistics for the Omak Airport are scheduled to be released in July2013. Although statistics have not been released by the FAA, it has been thought that a number of services are provided for commuter passenger service by the Omak City Council. Packages can be delivered to other airports by FedEx and the United Parcel Service (UPS) using Cessna 208 Caravans and Beechcraft Model 18s from Empire Airlines, FedEx Express and Pierce Aviation; the second has a fuel contract with the Omak City Council. Lifeline Aviation also commonly uses the airport. There is no non-commercial landing fee.|$|E
50|$|The all {{composite}} aircraft features a distinctive gull-wing design with pods that floats can attach to. A twin engine variant {{is powered by}} two Jabiru 3300 engines. In both {{the case of the}} <b>single</b> and twin <b>engined</b> versions, the engines are mounted in pusher configuration on a composite arch behind the cockpit.|$|R
50|$|The aerodrome was {{returned}} to civil aircraft operations in 1946 and has since been used by aero clubs and private pilot owners for the basing and operation of <b>single</b> and twin <b>engined</b> light aircraft and helicopters. There is a large wartime built Bellman hangar and smaller hangars which are used for aircraft maintenance and storage.|$|R
50|$|The Monoposto Racing Club {{has played}} {{a large role in}} the {{introduction}} of modern motorbike <b>engined</b> <b>single</b> seaters to UK race circuits. Approximately ten years ago the club regulations permitted motorcycle engined cars to race as part of the 1800cc class. At that time the 1000cc & 1400cc grid contained Jedi, re-engined chassis and even one of the Gordon Murray designed, road going, Rockets.|$|R
25|$|The {{squadron}} {{was first}} organized as a provisional unit at Kelly Field, Texas in June 1917. In early August the unit received formal recognition as the 38th Aero Squadron as the United States expanded the United States Army Air Service after entering World War I. A few weeks later, the squadron moved to Chanute Field, Illinois, where {{it served as}} a training unit, equipped with Curtiss JN-4 and DH-4 <b>single</b> <b>engined</b> biplanes. In July 1918, the Air Service renamed its squadrons at training fields {{if they were not}} programmed for overseas deployment as lettered squadrons and the 38th became Squadron A, Chanute Field. The squadron was demobilized in December 1918 as Chanute prepared to transition from a pilot training field into a temporary storage depot following the Armistice of 11 November 1918.|$|E
2500|$|The Westland Widgeon was a British light {{aircraft}} of the 1920s. [...] A <b>single</b> <b>engined</b> parasol monoplane, the Widgeon {{was built in}} small numbers before Westland abandoned production in 1929.|$|E
2500|$|The {{resulting}} {{design was}} a <b>single</b> <b>engined</b> biplane with single bay, unequal span tapered wings and a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. The aircraft was {{powered by a}} [...] Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasp Junior radial engine.|$|E
50|$|Other oddities at {{the dawn}} of the 1960s {{included}} single-deck buses on the double-deck AEC Regent V chassis, most of these were built for South Wales Transport for a route with a very low railway bridge in Llanelli under which underfloor <b>engined</b> <b>single</b> decks could not work but there were also one each for the Leeds Council Welfare department (with a rear ramp for wheelchair access) and for the Coal Industry Social Welfare Organisation.|$|R
50|$|Founded in 1982 by Captain Geronimo Amurao,a Philippine Airlines pilot, {{the college}} has around 2,500 students. The main campus {{features}} 28 aircraft, both <b>single</b> and twin <b>engined,</b> and a hangar {{next to a}} classroom building. There is also a remote resort where students can rest and recreate during multi-day training sessions. The curriculum covers Bachelor of Science degrees both in Aviation and Office Administration. The Aviation degree has majors in aircraft maintenance, aerospace engineering, and avionics technology. The Office Administration degree covers airline management, tourism, and computer science. There {{are a number of}} non-degree programs in the same subjects, plus training to become a private pilot, commercial pilot, flight instructor, and flight attendant.|$|R
50|$|After {{the initial}} post-war boom Roe also {{took on a}} great deal of repair, {{rebuilding}} and refurbishment work, adding a workshop for this purpose. Plymouth Corporation had its entire fleet of Guy Arab utility buses thoroughly rebuilt by Roe, some 100 passing through the works. Roe also extended the Brush or Metro-Cammell bodies of Midland Red's post-war underfloor <b>engined</b> <b>single</b> deckers from 27 ft 6in to 29 ft 3in, allowing an extra four seats to be fitted. This work covered classes S6, S8, S9, S11 and all but one of S10, a grand total of 455 buses all converted in 1952 or 1953. In 1952 Charles H Roe resigned from the position of managing director, although he remained as chairman.|$|R
