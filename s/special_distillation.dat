50|$|Buryat shamans {{generally}} prefer tarasun to vodka for usage {{in religious}} ceremonies as {{they feel that}} tarasun is more pure as it is made with <b>special</b> <b>distillation</b> equipment which only the affluent own and hence, is not made in villages. Also, according to the Buryat religion, milk and the colour white were always associated with the pure. In recent times, however, this trend is getting reversed as tarasun is being gradually replaced by vodka. A Buryat Conference which met at Irkutsk on 15 April 1917, {{in the aftermath of}} the February Revolution, prohibited the production of tarasun for normal consumption making it a punishable offense while allowing concessions for the religious usage of tarasun.|$|E

5000|$|The {{former owner}} of Littlemill Distillery, Duncan Barton, {{developed}} the current {{site for the}} Loch Lomond Distillery. He brought innovative pot malt stills which rest in the cylindrical necks of the spirit stills. Traditionally the necks of malt stills are open. The Loch Lomond stills include <b>special</b> <b>distillation</b> trays in the necks, allowing for greater contact with the cooling alcohol vapour, said to make the process more efficient. These stills can produce alcohol up to 90% ABV where normal stills deliver the alcohol at around 70% ABV. This style of still allows for different ‘ flavour notes’ to be captured and emphasised through the range of alcohol strengths that can be captured and rejected. This {{is much more difficult}} to achieve through a conventional pot still.|$|E

My aim was to improve the batch distillation separation of azeotropic mixtures. A new algorithm was presented for the determination of product sequences of batch distillation of multicomponent azeotropic mixtures. Non-conventional configurations were studied by simulation with emphasis on closed operation. The effects of off-cut recycle on a six-batch separation process of a waste solvent mixture were also investigated. Batch extractive distillation was studied for the separation of two azeotropic mixtures. A new extractive policy was also proposed. A generalised model of batch heteroazeotropic distillation with variable decanter hold-up was developed. This model was extended for batch heterogeneous extractive distillation...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of vapour-liquid equilibria-based separation alternatives can be extraordinarily complicated {{for the treatment}} of process wastewaters containing heterogeneous-azeotropic. Despite dissimilar successfully tested methods for separation, there is possibility to get better distillation method by enabling the separation of more and more specific process wastewater. Extractive heterogeneous-azeotropic distillation (EHAD) is a new advance in treatment of fine chemical wastewater showing special features to cope with the treatment of highly non-ideal mixtures. This method combines the worth of heterogeneous-azeotropic and extractive distillations in one apparatus without addition of any extra materials. The study of the separations of ternary component process wastewater from the fine chemical industry shows both in the modelled and experimental results that EHAD can be successfully applied. The measured and modelled compositions at extreme purities, that is, close to 0 % or 100 %, can be different because of the inaccuracies of the modelling. This highlights the paramount importance of the experiments if special extra-fine chemicals with almost no impurities, e. g. of pharmacopoeial quality are to be produced by <b>special</b> <b>distillation</b> technique. This study expands the {{application of}} EHAD technique, this new field is the separation of process wastewaters...|$|E

40|$|A laser {{homodyne}} spectrometer with {{a measurable}} angular range of 20 °- 150 ° and a temperature control of better than ± 0. 001 °C was interfaced with an IBM 1800 digital computer for direct on-line data {{acquisition of the}} angular and the spectral distribution of the scattered intensity from a two-component critical liquid system, perfluoromethylcyclohexane-carbon tetrachloride, near its critical mixing point. Both components were purified by preparative gas chromatography and subsequent vacuum <b>distillation.</b> <b>Special</b> care was taken to select appropriate columns for the separation of impurities and to prevent contamination of the system from moisture. Scattering data were obtained {{by means of a}} cylindrical light-scattering cell of 8 mm i. d. and a flat cell with a 1 mm light path. The intensity measurements were obtained using an angular aperture of 1. 4 ° while the linewidth measurements were obtained using an angular aperture of 0. 5 °. From our intensity studies we have observed that (1) the K 2 dependence in the reciprocal scattered intensity due to concentration fluctuations (I- 1 c) is obeyed (2) the temperature dependence of the extrapolated zeroangle scattered intensity which is related to the osmotic coefficient (δµ/δC) P, T, has the form : [MATH]I- 1 c α εγ, where ε = (T - Tc) /Tc; and γ is a critical exponent. We have obtained γ = 1. 15 ± 0. 02 at the critical solution concentration. The Rayleigh linewidth of the critical mixture was measured at temperatures between 0. 006 ° and 0. 715 °C above Tc, for scattering angles 30 ° ≤θ≤ 150 ° so that 7. 04 x 104 cm- 1 ≤ K ≤ 2. 63 x 105 cm- 1. In the hydrodynamic region where ζs K ≪ 1, we find Ɖ = DK 2 with D = D 0 εγ*; D 0 = (1, 24 ± 0, 04) 10 - 5 cm 2 /s where D 0 εγ*; D 0 = (1, 24 ± 0, 04) 10 - 5 cm 2 /s and γ* = 0, 665 ± 0, 018 0. 018. In the non-local hydrodynamic region where ζs K is small but not negligible when compared with unity, our results agree with a modified Rayleigh linewidth equation Ɖ = DK 2 (1 + b ζ 2 K 2) where ζ = ζ 0 ε-ν. With b = 3 / 5 we find ζ 0 = 4, 13 ± 0, 22 Å et v = 0, 540 ± 0, 023. In the critical region where ζs K > 1, we show that Ɖ approaches AK 3. In the region 0, 076 ≤ Kζs ≤ 3, 75, our data agree quite well with the Kawasaki extended mode-mode coupling theory. Our results show that a direct application of the Kadanoff-Swift-Kawasaki result γ* (= γ - Ψ) = ν is invalid. However, if we take into account the temperature dependence and anomaly of the high-frequency shear viscosity, then γ - Ψ approaches v and, in the case of isobutyric acid in water, γ - Ψ≈ν. Scaling-law considerations also lead us to question the validity of the relation (sv = 2 - α) or its equivalents sv = γ + 2 β and sv = µ + ν...|$|R
40|$|Distillation is {{the method}} the most {{frequently}} applied for the separation of liquid mixtures, e. g. for {{the recovery of the}} components of the waste solvent mixtures. Because of the high energy demand of these processes the optimal design and operation of the distillation equipments are important from economic and also environmental points of view. The separation of the azeotropic mixtures needs <b>special</b> <b>distillation</b> methods like heteroazeotropic distillation. In the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries it is often applied in batch mode. The aims of the thesis are to study the feasibility of a new Double-Column System (DCS) for batch heteroazeotropic distillation and to compare it with the traditional Batch Rectifier (BR) equipped with a decanter to study the above configurations by rigorous simulation to extend the DCS (Generalised Double-Column System, GDCS) and to study this new configuration by the above methods to do laboratory experiments for both configurations in order to prove the feasibility of the separation and validate the calculations, respectively. Two new double-column configurations for batch heteroazeotropic distillation were studied. These configurations are designed to produce simultaneously the components of binary heteroazeotropic and homoazeotropic mixtures (by using an entrainer). They are operated in closed system (without continuous product withdrawal). First the feasibility of the separation of a heteroazeotropic mixture (1 -butanol – water) and that of a homoazeotropic one by using an entrainer (isopropanol – water + benzene or cyclohexane) in the DCS were investigated by a simplified model. Then the operation of this configuration was modelled by rigorous simulation by using the dynamic simulator of the professional flowsheet simulator ChemCAD (CC-DColumn). On the basis of the results obtained by both methods the new configuration was compared with the BR. The DCS proved to be feasible and competitive with the BR: during the same or shorter time the recoveries of the components were higher. Then the DCS was extended to a more flexible version (Generalised Double-Column System, GDCS), which is suitable for the separation of binary homoazeotropic mixtures (by using an entrainer, in this work: cyclohexane or n- exane). The feasibility method was extended for the study of this configuration, as well. The GDCS proved to be feasible. Then the effects of its additional operational parameters on the duration were studied by rigorous simulation. The GDCS was compared with the DCS by rigorous simulation, as well. The GDCS proved to be more advantageous than the DCS: the duration was shorter and the specific energy demands of the products were lower. The DCS and GDCS were also investigated by laboratory and pilot plant experiments. First laboratory experiments were done for the separation of the binary heteroazeotropic mixture in a simple small size glass equipment operated as BR and DCS. The DCS proved to be feasible and competitive with the BR also {{on the basis of the}} results of these experiments: during the same time the recovery of both components were higher. Then a pilot plant was used for the same separation as a DCS. After this experiment the separation of the binary homoazeotropic mixture by using n-hexane as entrainer was studied in the equipment operated as BR and GDCS. The experiment showed that the simultaneous production of two components is feasible also in the GDC...|$|E
