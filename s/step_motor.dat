50|$|On the Apple II, unlike modern {{computers}} that use standardized device drivers to manage device communications, {{the operating system}} directly controlled the <b>step</b> <b>motor</b> that moves the floppy drive head, and also directly interpreted the raw data, called nibbles, read from each track to identify the data sectors. This allowed complex disk-based software copy protection, by storing data on half tracks (0, 1, 2.5, 3.5, 5, 6...), quarter tracks (0, 1, 2.25, 3.75, 5, 6...), and any combination thereof. In addition, tracks {{did not need to}} be perfect rings, but could be sectioned so that sectors could be staggered across overlapping offset tracks, the most extreme version being known as spiral tracking. It was also discovered that many floppy drives did not have a fixed upper limit to head movement, and it was sometimes possible to write an additional 36th track above the normal 35 tracks. The standard Apple II copy programs could not read such protected floppy disks, since the standard DOS assumed that all disks had a uniform 35-track, 13- or 16-sector layout. Special nibble-copy programs such as Locksmith and Copy II Plus could sometimes duplicate these disks by using a reference library of known protection methods; when protected programs were cracked they would be completely stripped of the copy protection system, and transferred onto a standard format disk that any normal Apple II copy program could read.|$|E

40|$|<b>Stepping</b> <b>motors</b> {{are used}} in {{numerous}} applications because of their low manufacturing cost and simple open loop position control capabilities. It {{is well known that}} their energy efficiency is low but actual values are generally not available. Moreover, the bulk of the <b>stepping</b> <b>motor</b> applications are driven in open loop, with maximum current, to avoid step loss. A full step drive algorithm results in a low efficiency. In this paper the influence of the control algorithm on the efficiency of the motor is analyzed, measured and discussed. The basic open loop full-, half- and micro stepping algorithms are considered together with a more intelligent vector control algorithm. For each algorithm, torque/current optimization is discussed. As <b>stepping</b> <b>motors</b> are typically used for a broader range of torques and speeds, nominal values are not given. To present the efficiency of the motor for different control strategies, at every operating point, ISO efficiency curves are used. With these curves, the efficiencies of the different control strategies can be compared. As <b>stepping</b> <b>motors</b> are mostly used for low-power position control one can argue that <b>stepping</b> <b>motor</b> efficiency is not an issue. However the number of <b>stepping</b> <b>motors</b> installed worldwide is enormous.
