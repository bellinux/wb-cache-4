50|$|Sarah and {{her husband}} married on 12 May 1807, and were known as Lord and Lady Chartley, a {{courtesy}} title from his grandfather, the 1st Marquess Townshend. In September 1807, {{on the death of}} the 1st Marquess, the couple became the Earl and Countess of Leicester, also by courtesy. They separated a few months later, in May 1808, and she filed an ecclesiastical <b>suit</b> <b>for</b> <b>annulment,</b> alleging non-consummation, i.e. that the couple had never had sex. While the suit was still pending, Lady Leicester eloped with John Margetts, a brewer, and married him in a bigamous ceremony at Gretna Green in October 1809. Her first marriage was never dissolved, which became a legal problem for the succession of the Townshend peerage. In 1811 her legal husband became the 3rd Marquess Townshend, but after leaving him, she did not use his name for over a decade, calling herself Mrs. Margetts; and Margetts gave his name to their children. Sarah survived both men: Margetts died in 1842, and Marquess Townshend died abroad in December 1855. She remarried a few weeks after her legal widowhood, to James Laidler on 10 January 1856, and died on 11 September 1858.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a brief {{analysis}} of the legal framework regarding the procedural and substantial dispositions governing the claim <b>for</b> the <b>annulment</b> of the resolutions of the general meeting of shareholders. The main objective is to render a practical tool both to stakeholders and third parties who are interested in the legal means available for blocking the implementation of any measures which are contrary to the company’s interest. Further to the amendments brought through the New Civil Procedural Code, the claim <b>for</b> <b>annulment</b> of the resolutions of the general assembly must be analyzed from a procedural point of view, as well as from a substantial standpoint. The shareholders must be aware of the grounds for challenging a general assembly's resolution to properly safeguard their rights. One common issue which is invoked as grounds <b>for</b> <b>annulment</b> is the abuse of majority of the majority shareholder. However, the difficulty of alleging such a reason is left to practitioners. Therefore, its application, although not wide, is highly imaginative...|$|R
40|$|Locus standi of non-privileged {{applicants}} {{to bring an}} action <b>for</b> <b>annulment</b> Abstract Every developed legal system is bound to have a mechanism for checking the procedural and substantive legality of measures adopted by its institutions. In the European Union it was of significant importance to create a system of control over the acts of the EU institutions given the democratic deficit within the Union and the limited supervisory role of the European Parliament. Binding acts of the EU institutions are subject to review through a number of routes provided by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and the Treaty on the European Union (TEU), namely action <b>for</b> <b>annulment</b> (Art. 263 TFEU), the plea of illegality (Art. 277 TFEU), the preliminary reference (Art. 267 TFEU) and the action for damages (Arts. 268 and 340 TFEU). The Court has consistently endeavoured to treat the several strands as a complex and coherent system of judicial review within the Union based on the rule of law. The action <b>for</b> <b>annulment</b> under Art. 263 TFEU plays a crucial role for individuals as it is in practice the only direct way open to individuals to challenge the acts of EU institutions. The main purpose of my thesis is to examine whether the current wording of Art. 263 (4) TFEU provides for individuals a sufficiently [...] ...|$|R
