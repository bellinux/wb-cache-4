25|$|Winter {{activities}} at Our Chalet run from December through April. These activities include skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing, snowtubing, cross country skiing, winter walking, ice skating, curling, ice climbing, tobogganing, sit <b>skiing,</b> <b>tailing,</b> sleigh rides, and various night activities, among others. Adelboden {{is also known}} for skiing and hosts the International Ski Federation (FIS).|$|R
50|$|He is {{best known}} for inventing the octograb, a trick that {{consists}} of grabbing one <b>ski's</b> <b>tail</b> with the right hand and the nose of the other ski with the left hand. His most famous trick is the Octograb 1260. To do the octograb, Gagnier grabs the right <b>ski’s</b> <b>tail</b> with his right hand and the tip of the other ski with his left. With a move like that it’s clear why Gagnier has long been considered one of the elite slopestyle skiers in the world.Beginning his competitive career as a ski racer in Quebec, Gagnier first started skiing at the age of four with his family at Canada’s Mont-Sainte-Anne resort. As part of a family of freeskiers, Gagnier credits his brothers for pushing him to be the skier he is today. His older brother Antoine was the first to introduce him to freeskiing when he was 15 and his younger brother Vincent is one of the names to watch out for in the future.Known for an innovative approach to rails and grabs, Gagnier {{was one of the first}} skiers to perfect spinning in both directions. In 2003 he broke onto the scene in a big way with eighth at the US Freeskiing Open and his first invite to the X Games.However, it was his performance at the 2005 X Games that has come to define Gagnier’s career. After a win at the US Open, Gagnier entered the X Games on a hot streak and won the gold. The win was even more meaningful because it crushed Tanner Hall’s chance to four-peat in slopestyle.|$|R
25|$|The {{final design}} looked much like Noorduyn's earlier Fokker designs, a high-wing braced {{monoplane}} with an all-welded steel tubing fuselage. Attached wood stringers carried a fabric skin. Its wing was all fabric covered wood, except for steel tubing flaps and ailerons. The divided landing gear were fitted to fuselage stubs; legs were secured with two bolts each {{to allow the}} alternate arrangement of floats or <b>skis.</b> The <b>tail</b> wheel strut could be fitted with a wheel or tail skid.|$|R
50|$|Described in the {{direction}} of travel, the front of the ski, typically pointed or rounded, is the tip, the middle is the waist and the rear is the <b>tail.</b> <b>Skis</b> have four aspects define their basic performance: length, width, sidecut and camber. Skis also differ in more minor ways to address certain niche roles. For instance, mogul skis are softer to absorb shocks, powder skis are wider to provide more float and rocker skis bent upwards (reverse camber) at the tip and tail {{to make it easier to}} turn in deep and heavy snow.|$|R
5000|$|Ski {{geometry}} is {{the shape}} of the ski. Described in the direction of travel, the front of the ski, typically pointed or rounded, is the tip, the middle is the waist and the rear is the <b>tail.</b> <b>Skis</b> have four aspects define their basic performance: length, width, sidecut and camber. Skis also differ in more minor ways to address certain niche roles. For instance, skis for moguls are much softer to absorb shocks from the quick and sharp turns of the moguls and skis for powder are much wider to provide more [...] "float" [...] in deeper, softer snow.|$|R
5000|$|The Invader showcased a {{new concept}} that {{inspired}} {{a new way of}} riding {{in and out of the}} park. The Invader's progressive [...] "Butter Zone" [...] construction featured a thinner ski in front and behind the boot that allowed the rider to lean forwards or backwards to playfully [...] "butter" [...] around in most any condition. Buttering is the act of spinning around on ones tips or tails, picture butter being spread on toast. The <b>ski</b> tips or <b>tails</b> act as a slippery pivot point. Buttering opened up a new world of technical tricks. People began buttering off of jumps and onto rails and even using the technique to continue tricks after they landed them, a similar concept of reverting on a skateboard.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Epidermal Langerhans cells (LCs) and dermal {{dendritic}} cells (dDCs) capture cutaneous antigens {{and present}} them to T-cells in lymph nodes (LNs). The function of LCs and Langerin+ dDCs was extensively {{studied in the}} mouse, but their anatomical repartition is unknown. Here, we found LCs in back skin, footpads and tail skin of C 57 BL/ 6, BALB/c, 129 /Sv and CBA/J mice. Langerin+ dDCs were readily observed in back skin of all strains, but only in footpads and tail of BALB/c and CBA/J mice. Similarly, while LCs were equally present in all LNs and strains, Langerin+ dDCs were found in popliteal LNs (draining footpads) only in BALB/c and CBA/J mice. The sciatic LNs, which we identified as the major tail-draining lymphoid organ, were devoid of Langerin+ dDCs in all strains. Thus, functionally different DCs reside in different skin areas, with variations among mouse strains, implying a potential impact on the cutaneous immune reaction. Key words: dermal dendritic cells – footpad skin – Langerhans cells – skin-draining lymph nodes – <b>tail</b> <b>ski...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purposes}} of this study are to develop a simulator generating a ski board vibration in actual skiing and to perform the basic construction for clarifying the ski sliding mechanism, which still has not been clarified completely. In the simulator developed in this study, the surface {{on the bottom of the}} ski was assumed as to be a snowy slope and a mass of snow (snow pack) assuming a skier had slid on this ski bottom surface. A ball vibrator connected to a large- sized compressor was installed onto the ski panel in order to vibrate a ski board. The compressed air from the compressor rotated a steel ball in the vibrator at high speed, causing vibration on the ski. A dynamic friction force (F) was detected by the digital force gauge when the snow pack was sliding from the top of the <b>ski</b> to the <b>tail</b> on the surface formed by the bottom of the ski. A coefficient of kinetic friction (μk) was calculated using this dynamic friction force. Furthermore, the velocity and acceleration of the snow pack were measured by two high speeded cameras. The experiment for confirming the validity of this simulator was carried out in the temperature conditions of - 5 °C. The velocity and acceleration of the snow pack with vibration were higher than without vibration. On the other hand, the coefficient of kinetic friction (μk) with vibration was lower than without vibration. From these results, the simulator is suitable for studying the role of vibration in ski sliding and for clarifying the ski sliding mechanism...|$|R
