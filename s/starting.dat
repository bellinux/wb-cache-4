5|$|In earlier seasons, 2005 and 2006, pilots first ran two {{qualifying}} rounds {{to determine}} <b>starting</b> order, with the fastest time <b>starting</b> last.

5|$|In <b>starting</b> a motor, a VFD {{initially}} applies a {{low frequency}} and voltage, thus avoiding high inrush current associated with direct-on-line <b>starting.</b> After {{the start of}} the VFD, the applied frequency and voltage are increased at a controlled rate or ramped up to accelerate the load. This <b>starting</b> method typically allows a motor to develop 150% of its rated torque while the VFD is drawing less than 50% of its rated current from the mains in the low-speed range. A VFD can be adjusted to produce a steady 150% <b>starting</b> torque from standstill right up to full speed. However, motor cooling deteriorates and can result in overheating as speed decreases such that prolonged low-speed operation with significant torque is not usually possible without separately motorized fan ventilation.|$|E

5|$|The {{defensive}} play of Taylor, Oliver, and Johnson greatly {{affected the}} course of the game and is apparent in Georgia's time of possession and average <b>starting</b> position in each of the quarters.

Their first-quarter time of possession was just 5:41, and their second-quarter possession time was 6:34. During the third and fourth quarters, when all four Virginia Tech turnovers took place, Georgia's time of possession jumped to 10:41 and 7:47, respectively. In the third quarter, their average <b>starting</b> possession gained tenyards to the Georgia 36, and during the final quarter, their average <b>starting</b> position was the Virginia Tech 36-yard line. This fact allowed Georgia to capitalize on the Virginia Tech turnovers, turning them into points on the scoreboard.|$|E
