40|$|Poultry {{can be an}} {{important}} source of food following drought and crop failure. Unfortunately, reduced staple crop production also affects the chickens so that they become scrawnier and less able to produce eggs thereby detracting from their potential contribution to human diet. The article below suggests one rather innovative means by which the nutrition of poultry may be safeguarded in times of drought and food scarcity. Eds Chickens are unable to manufacture 10 necessary amino acids or the B vitamins. 1 They therefore require a diet high in protein. In addition, they require fats and carbohydrates, and cannot exist on high fibre diets. When NGOs or the FAO have taken a role in the improvement of family poultry farming in the developing world, the diet endorsed is varied, comprised of grains and tubers "for energy " (millet, sorghum, maize, sweet potatoes, and even cassava); meals for protein (sunflower cake, fish meal, cotton seed cake, maize germ, <b>soya</b> <b>cake,</b> meat and bone meal) and vegetables "for vitamins " (green grass, green kale, and cabbage) 2 and green seaweed. 3 The grains are given as a supplement to foraging 4 with millet recommended as the best grain for protein supplementation in chickens. Where these are unavailable, leaf meals have been used, 5 and recent research suggests that the seeds of the Croton tree are valuable in supplying necessary oils and proteins. 1 In the search for less expensive, natively available food for chickens, recent studies suggest that tobacco seed cakes, 6 or even molasses from sugar cane residue, 7 can be reasonably and productively utilised, and that meal from azolla, snails or rice polishings are comparable to maize-soybean meal diets. 8 In Haiti, however, farmers often are unable to purchase any form o...|$|E
40|$|Publisher Summary Studies using a mixed fiber diet have {{emphasized}} the strong impact of dietary fibers (DF) on gut microbiota. As an example, a high-fiber diet containing 40 % <b>soya</b> <b>cake,</b> 20 % crude potato starch, 19 % wheat bran, and 5 % each of apple pectin and carob gum, given for 4 weeks to rats, led to a daily fecal output of anaerobes 71 times higher than a fiber-free diet. Similarly, daily excretion of total fermentation products was 20 times higher, with an increase of propionate and butyrate proportions. It is estimated that apples could provide 10 %– 30 % of the daily intake of fiber. Using a diet containing 100 g of apple fiber/kg, {{it has been shown}} that soluble dietary fiber (SDF) excreted in feces of rats was 10. 9 % of the SDF ingested, which suggests a low resistance to fermentation of this fraction, while only 43 % of the ingested insoluble fiber was fermented. The effects of five DF from different sources (carrot, wheat bran, cocoa seed, pea hull, and oat husks) have been assessed in human microbiota-associated (HMA) rats. HMA rats are initially germ-free rats colonized after weaning with the fecal microbiota of a healthy human volunteer. Use of this animal model is justified by the phylogenetic and metabolic differences between rats and human microbiota and the knowledge that HMA rodents globally retain the characteristics of the human donor microbiota. All of the diets contained 100 g fiber/kg and were given for 8 weeks. Both carrot and cocoa led to a higher proportion of acetate and a lower proportion of propionate in the cecum, and to a large production of methane. The concentration of lactate was significantly higher in rats fed on the carrot-fiber diet...|$|E
40|$|From the {{beginning}} of 2018, inclusion of non-organic protein sources are not allowed in the diet of 100 % organic poultry in Europe. In this situation, a major nutritional challenge is to make sustainable supply of organic protein and amino acid in competitive price. This necessity triggers to search alternative protein sources for sustainable organic egg production. Clover grass protein concentrate (CPC) is dried protein concentrate prepared by pulping clover grass mixture mainly containing Red clover to obtain green juice followed by fermentation, centrifugation and drying. The crude protein, lysine and methionine content in CPC were determined to be 355. 6, 20. 3 and 6. 3 g/kg dry matter respectively. This research was carried out to study the effect of graded level of clover grass protein concentrate in production performance, digestibility and egg quality of laying hens fed 100 % organic diet. Four diets (A, B, C, D) including CPC at level of 0 (control), 40, 80, and 120 g/kg (as fed) mainly {{at the expense of}} soya and <b>soya</b> <b>cake</b> were formulated to be iso-nitrogenous (CP= 18. 7 %) and iso-caloric (ME= 10. 5 MJ/kg) and fed to 240 Hisex hens for 12 weeks of experimental period in floor pen system in randomized block design (4 diets, 6 replicates, 10 birds/replicate) under environmental control system. Here, CPC contributed 0 (control diet), 7. 4, 14. 8 and 22. 2 % of dietary crude protein. Data related to daily average feed intake, egg production, and egg quality measures, feed to egg ratio were collected. To study nutrient digestibility, a digestibility trial was conducted in battery cages employing a complete randomized design with same environment as in floor pen system. Every time, the excreta was collected in a bin and stored at - 20 ºC to avoid possible microbial degradation. On {{the last day of the}} experiment, all eggs were collected to analyze egg quality. The egg shell quality was evaluated through shell fracture strength (N), fracture displacement (mm) at maximum force, fracture gradient (N/mm, elasticity), and the yolk quality through color. The present study showed that partial replacement of organic soybean and <b>soya</b> <b>cake</b> with organic clover grass protein concentrate does not influence negatively egg production parameters. The inclusion of 4, 8, and 12 % of CPC in the diets resulted similar feed intake (p= 0. 647), egg production (p= 0. 606), egg weight (p= 0. 11), egg mass per hen per day (p= 0. 815) and feed conversion ratio (0. 436) in comparison to hens fed control diet. The egg productivity (%) was 87. 37 for diet without Clover protein concentrate and 89. 01 for diet including 12 % of Clover protein concentrate and they were not statistically different. The digestibility experiment showed that for all four types of diets, total tract apparent digestibility of dry matter, and nitrogen retention were statistically similar. However, the coefficient of total tract apparent digestibility of methionine and lysine decreased significantly (p< 0. 001) with the increase of CPC from 4 to 12 % in diet. For all diets, egg shell strength and elasticity were comparable, however, the yolk color was significantly different. The lightness of yolk decreased while the redness increased significantly (p< 0. 0001) with the increase in CPC content in the diets. The yellowness was found significantly (p< 0. 0001) higher for diets with CPC but not among each other. The clover grass protein concentrate has positive effect on performance, digestibility and egg quality of laying hens fed 100 % organic diet and it can substantially substitute organic soybean or its product. It is concluded that clover grass protein concentrate is a promising protein source for organic laying hens to achieve optimum productivity and egg quality...|$|E

40|$|Among hemicellulases, xylanases are {{catalysts}} {{of considerable}} interest so as fundamental than applied point of view. However, it is paradoxical {{to note that}} the high cost of their production limits their use on a large scale. The use of purified xylan as culture substrate increases the production cost of the enzyme. Consequently, for commercial applications, it is advisable to develop processes starting from inexpensive substrates. The {{purpose of this study is}} to optimise xylanases production in solid-state fermentation based on agricultural residues. The strain is Penicillium canescens 10 - 10 c, selected in our laboratory for his ability to produce xylanase activity free of cellulase. Assays concern optimization of different culture parameters in order to develop in the future a solid-state fermentation reactor with <b>soya</b> oil <b>cake.</b> These parameters are: medium composition, temperature incubation, induction and repression mechanisms. <b>Soya</b> oil <b>cake</b> in pellets (size> 10 mm) gave a higher enzymatic activity. Great volume of culture medium reduced the enzymatic production. The presence of lactose, saccharose or starch of corn has a positive effect on the production of xylanase while the presence of xylose, mannose, galactose, arabinose, cellobiose and pectin or methylcellulose reduces the production of xylanase. The sources of phosphorus (di-potassic and di-sodic) enhance xylanase production. The enzymatic production obtained in Erlenmeyer flasks (250 ml) after 7 days incubation at 30 °C is about 14 000 U. g- 1 of carbon source. The nature of inoculum affects the enzymatic productivity. Indeed, better productivity was obtained with inoculation by solid preculture (956 U. g- 1 per day) than liquid preculture (473 U. g- 1 per day) and spores suspension (383 U. g- 1 per day).

40|$|Thesis (MPhil (Animal Sciences)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2004. African Grey Parrots are {{now being}} bred on a {{commercial}} scale in South Africa, mainly for the export market. In order to produce the best breeding results {{it is necessary to}} formulate balanced diets but no research has been done on the feeding value for African Grey parrots of ingredients used in formulating diets. Once the apparent metabolisable energy (AME) of extruded maize for African Greys has been established {{it will be possible to}} calculate the AME of other ingredients such as full fat <b>soya,</b> <b>soya</b> oil <b>cake</b> or sunflower oil cake. By feeding an extruded mix containing a known amount of maize mixed with a known amount of <b>soya</b> oil <b>cake</b> and establishing experimentally the AME of the mix, the AME of <b>soya</b> oil <b>cake</b> for African Greys can be calculated by difference. This information will make it possible to decide whether AME results obtained for poultry can be used in formulating diets for African Grey parrots. The study consisted of two parts where the determination of the apparent metabolisable energy (AME) of extruded maize and the practical application thereof in formulating parrot diets, and the economic viability of a commercial African Grey parrot breeding operation was investigated. A reference procedure adopted by several European laboratories for the in vivo determination of metabolisable energy (ME) was used to determine the apparent metabolisable energy (AME) of extruded whole maize for African Grey parrots. The long term goal is to make a well balanced, extruded diet for these birds. Extruded maize is the form in which maize is generally included in commercial parrot diets and was therefore chosen as the experimental feed. Maize can be conveniently extruded with other single ingredients such as full fat soyabean meal, soyabean oil cake meal or sunflower oil cake meal to determine, by difference, the AME of those ingredients. For the first part of the study, ten, 3 -year-old African Grey parrots were individually housed and fed in cages designed to facilitate collection of the faeces. Cage design varied between a tall type (n= 6) and a low type (n= 4). The parrots were acclimatized to their new environment before the trial commenced to ensure normal feeding behaviour. The average AME value established for the ten African Grey Parrots was 16. 8 MJ/kg. In the trial it became apparent that it is very difficult to get consistent results with the cages used and a modified cage design is proposed for the future. The second part of the study investigated the economic viability of breeding African Grey parrots commercially, with extruded maize as part of their diet. It was generally concluded that the breeding of African Grey parrots for the pet market can be considered as an economical venture...|$|R

Researchers at the Asian Institute of Technology have been investigating the system and have found it is best suited to warmer areas of the world, where water temperatures exceed 20 °C. The fish species most appropriate to the system are Chinese and Indian carp, common carp, tilapia, mullet and silver-striped catfish. Pig manure itself has little value for the fish, but its fertilizing effect encourages the growth of phytoplankton, which is filtered {{out of the water}} by the fish.

In Experiment 2, we studied the replacement (0, 33, or 67 %) of rapeseed cake with blue lupins in fattening pig diets. The dietary lupin level had a quadratic effect on the weight gain of growing pigs, the best performance being observed at the 33 % replacement level. However, dietary lupin level did not influence weight gain during the finishing period and total fattening. Back fat became softer with increasing dietary lupin levels.

On the average the samples contained 31. 7 g/ 100 g DM crude protein (range, 25. 2 - 34. 3 g/ 100 g DM); 20. 6 g/ 100 g DM crude fat (range, 9. 2 - 29. 6 g/ 100 g DM); 8. 0 g/ 100 g DM crude fibre(range, 2. 5 - 22. 4 g/ 100 g DM) and ash 10. 5 g/ 100 g (range, 2. 0 - 20 g/ 100 g DM) The protein content of the snacks were generally {{similar to those of}} the oilseed cakes, while the fat content of the snacks were much higher. The crude fibre content was least in kulikuli while PKC had the highest value. The ash content of the snacks were generally much higher than those of the oilseed cakes. The gross energy ranged between 310. 8 kcal/ 100 g in PKC to 559. 2 kcal/ 100 g in kulikuli. Ca, Mg, P, K and Na were the most abundant minerals in both the snacks and oilseed cakes, while the Zn, Cu and Mn were the least abundant. The snacks were particularly much higher in their Na content. Among the functional attributes, the water absorption capacity (WAC) ranged from 70 to 220 % in the traditional snacks, and from 200 to 260 % in the oilseed cakes. Foaming absorption capacity (FAC), varied from 128 to 147 % in the snacks while it varied from 184 to 221 % in the oilseed cakes. The least gelation concentration of Kulikuli, Robo and palm kernel cake were identical. Fat emulsion capacity and emulsion stability were also similar in all the products. All the samples had varying solubilities with change in pH. The proteins generally had multiple maxima and minima in their solubilities...|$|R
40|$|The {{available}} {{literature on}} abalone nutrition was synthesised {{and the prospects}} for developing a complete pelleted dry feed for Haliotis midae evaluated. The similar body compositions, digestive structures, enzyme activity, acceptance {{of a wide variety}} of feed ingredients and comparable growth performance on formulated diets of various abalone species suggests that they have similar nutritional requirements. Abalone also appear to be similar to other farmed monogastric animals in that digestion is primarily extracelluar and they possess a large, muscular crop and stomach. Abalone energy metabolism is carbohydrate based. They are capable of digesting high levels of dietary protein but their ability to utilise fat is limited. Abalone have been shown to consume predictable amounts of dry feed which is efficiently converted into body weight. Efficiency indices of utilisation of formulated feeds, such as feed conversion ratio, protein efficiency ratio, net protein utilisation and apparent digestibility have been successfully applied to abalone. It was concluded that the prospects for developing complete diets for H. midae using a conventional animal feed science model were good. The ability of H. midae to utilise a range of proteins which had potential for inclusion in practical diets was investigated. Five protein rich ingredients, namely, casein, fishmeal, <b>soya</b> oil <b>cake,</b> Spirulina, and torula yeast, were fed to H. midae in semi-purified diets. Two algal diets, fresh Plocamium corallorhiza and dried Ecklonia maxima were fed as controls. Abalone fed on fishmeal and Spirulina based diets displayed significantly higher growth rates than diets containing <b>soya</b> oil <b>cake,</b> torula yeast, casein and E. maxima. Growth rates of abalone fed with P. corallorhiza were significantly lower than all other diets. All artificial diets yield lower feed conversion ratios (0. 7 - 1. 8) and higher protein efficiency ratios (3. 3 - 6. 5) ratios than the seaweed control diets (FCR = 2. 8 - 3. 4; PER = 2. 2 - 3. 0). The results indicated that fishmeal and Spirulina were the most suitable proteins for inclusion in practical diets for H. midae. The effect of protein level on growth rate and nutritional indices was evaluated by feeding starch bound, fishmeal based diets containing 27, 32, 37, 42 and 47 % protein to juvenile H. midae. Weight gain was positively related to the level of dietary protein, increasing by 18 % between 27 % and 47 % protein. Protein efficiency ratio declining from 3. 2 to 2. 3 with an increasing dietary protein content. Feed consumption rate was approximately 1 % of body weight per day for all diets. Post-weaning abalone (ca. lOmm shell length, 0. 2 g) differed from larger juveniles (ca. 35 mm, 8 g) in their response to varying proportions of dietary protein and energy. The smaller animals appeared to have a lower protein requirement and poorer ability to utilise lipid than the larger juveniles. Proximate analyses revealed that the levels of protein, lipid and carbohydrate in abalone soft tissue increased with increasing dietary levels of these nutrients. Larger juveniles contained significantly higher levels of protein and carbohydrate, but lower levels of lipid, ash and moisture, than the smaller post-weaning abalone. The assimilation efficiency of [U-¹⁴C]-arginine by H. midae fed diets enriched with [U-¹⁴C]-arginine was only 0. 45 %. Furthennore, supplementation of diets with graded levels of crystalline arginine did not have any effect on growth rates. It was concluded that the prospects for defining the quantitative amino acid requirements of H. midae using crystalline amino acids are not promising. Rates of gastric evacuation and enzyme secretion were monitored in juvenile H. midae fed an extruded, fishmeal based dry feed. Gut fullness peaked 6 h after feed was offered and the bulk of feed consumed was digested within 24 h. Enzyme secretion appeared to begin with the onset of feeding and continued for at least 6 h after peak gut fullness was attained. Protease activity increased significantly following ingestion but amylase activity was maintained at a more or less constant level. A low level of lipase activity was observed suggesting that the ability of H. midae to digest fat is limited. The growth rate of H. midae fed an extruded, fishmeal based feed increased with increasing temperature between 12 °C and 20 °C. Between 20 °C and 24 °C a marked decline in growth rate accompanied by a deterioration in feed conversion and increased mortality was observed. Consumption of a dry pelleted feed was shown to be a function of body size and temperature. Based on these data a model which predicts a daily ration for H. midae was developed. The present study showed that H. midae efficiently utilises extruded dry feeds containing conventional feed ingredients. Although technical difficulties were encountered in measuring apparent digestibility, it was concluded that the prospects for developing practical diets according to established nutritional principles are promising...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{value of}} cold press <b>soya</b> bean oil <b>cake</b> (CPSBOC) {{as the source}} of protein in beef cattle was evaluated. CPSBOC was {{included}} in the diets of beef weaners at different levels i. e. 0 %, 6 %, 13 % and 20 %. The control diet contained cotton seed oil cake (CSOC) as a protein source. The diets were formulated to be isonitrogenous. A total of 40 weaners (20 heifers and 20 steers) at an average weight of 192. 3 ± 20 kg were used. The experiment was a randomized block design with ten replicates per treatment and was conducted over 98 days. The group mass of the steers (700 ± 7. 80 kg) was significantly heavier when compared with the heifers (6480 ± 7. 80 kg). The average daily gain (ADG) (1. 5 ± 2. 72) and feed conversion ratio (FCR) (5. 5 ± 0. 051) of the steers was significantly better than the heifers (1. 35 ± 2. 72 and 5. 7 ± 0. 051, respectively) while the steers consume more feed (8. 2 ± 14. 4 kg) per day as compared to the 7. 4 ± 14. 4 kg consumed by heifers. The weaners that were fed the diet containing 6 % and 13 % inclusion of CPSBOC grew significantly better than the other treatments. According to this study, an inclusion level of CPSBOC of between 6 and 13 % will yield suitable growth in feedlot cattle. More {{research is needed to determine}} the optimum inclusion level of CPSBOC...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the nutrition of a popular ornamental fish, the swordtail (Xiphophorus helleri), under intensive aquaculture conditions. The study focused on the formulation and manufacture of artificial dry diets, as well as the influence of livefeed supplementation on growth and nutritional indices of both juvenile and broodstock fish. A combination of 65 % fishmeal and 35 % <b>soya</b> oil <b>cake</b> meal was found to closely approximate the essential amino acid profile of X helleri (r² = 94, 3 %) and lysine was identified as the first limiting amino acid. The influence of dietary protein and energy on the growth of X helleri was investigated by means of a growth trial comparing a range of nine test diets combining 3 crude protein (45, 38 and 30 %) and 3 digestible energy (16, 5, 14, 5 and 12, 5 kJ/gram) levels. A high crude protein content (45 % dry matter) and a protein to energy ratio of ≥ 27 mg protein per kJ digestible energy was shown to promote optimal growth rate and feed conversion ratio in juvenile X helleri. The final body protein and lipid content of the fish were significantly correlated with the dietary protein to energy ratio. The nutritional value of identical dietary formulations prepared by drum-drying or cold extrusion techniques and presented either as flake or crumble particles was evaluated in a growth trial and through analysis of vitamin C levels in the diets. Up to 27 % of vitamin C activity was destroyed during the drum-drying of flake diets, while 80 % of the remaining vitamin C was lost through leaching within 10 minutes of immersion in water. A crumble-type diet was shown to be acceptable to X helleri, and yielded significantly better growth rate and feed conversion than the equivalent flake feed. Almost 19 % of fish fed the flake diets developed vitamin C deficiency symptoms including scoliosis and lordosis, while this was completely prevented by feeding crumbles, indicating a significant restriction of leaching losses from this type of particle. The use of livefeed (Daphnia spp.) as a daily supplement to dry feeds was shown to result in a significant improvement in growth rate and survival of juvenile swordtail fish. Furthermore, the synergistic action of nutrients contained in the livefeed resulted in an improvement in the feed conversion efficiency of the artificial formulation. While mortalities of 13, 4 % and 15 % were recorded in fish fed exclusively on flake feed or Daphnia, no mortality occurred in the group fed the supplemented diet. Furthermore, the incidence of vitamin C deficiency symptoms was prevented by daily supplementation with Daphnia. Fish fed exclusively on Daphnia exhibited significantly more intense pigmentation due to carotenoids contained in the livefeed. In broodstock fish maintained primarily on flake diets, growth rate, feed conversion ratio as well as reproductive performance, as measured by fecundity, were significantly improved by daily livefeed supplementation. Weekly supplementation showed no measurable advantage over flake feed only. A direct correlation was demonstrated between fecundity and size of female fish with a mean fecundity of 190 embryos per female in those fed a daily Daphnia supplement. This was significantly higher than the yield from the non-supplemented or weekly supplemented treatments (133 and 140 embryos per female respectively). Despite these differences, the number of young harvested during the experiment did not differ between treatments and this discrepancy was ascribed to parental cannibalism of newborn juveniles. This phenomenon constitutes a major potential bottleneck in production with estimates of up to seventy percent of young lost in some exp experimental tanks. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that established aquaculture nutrition principles and techniques are applicable to the tropical ornamental fish species, X helleri. It was demonstrated that by using balanced crumble feed formulations, and regular livefeed supplementation, production yields under intensive conditions may be significantly improved. Suggestions for future work on poeciliid production in South Africa include investigation of the economic implications of the recommendations stemming from this project, and further research into effective restriction of parental cannibalism of newborn fish. ...|$|R
40|$|Vaccination for village chickens? Cue: While the {{vaccination}} of poultry against {{diseases such as}} Newcastle disease is a standard practice on commercial farms, among village chicken keepers it is much less common. The reasons for this are not hard to guess. In the first place, vaccines tend to be expensive, and only available in large doses suitable for hundreds or even thousands of birds. Secondly, until recently Newcastle disease vaccines have needed to be kept at a low temperature {{in order to remain}} effective. This has meant that vaccination programmes have needed to maintain a cold chain, a system for keeping the vaccine cool, while being transported to villages, making the process much more difficult and expensive to manage. So how can an effective system for vaccinating village chickens be managed? That was the question that Chris Kakunta asked when he spoke to David Daka, Chief Animal Husbandry Officer at the Zambia Institute of Animal Health. IN:		?One of the diseases you are ? OUT:		?So you must feed well. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 22 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: David Daka of the Zambia Institute of Animal Health with some advice on village chicken rearing. Transcript Daka	One of the diseases you are looking at could be Newcastle disease, which can wipe almost 80 - 90 % of the flock, you lose everything. So this is the challenge. Kakunta	How can small scale farmers effectively manage a vaccination programme so that their chickens, village chickens do not die of Newcastle? Daka	Before I come to your question, we must know that Newcastle disease is a viral disease. Once birds are attacked, it means that there is no treatment, they just have to die. Those that survive will have problems in growth rates. So we must do everything possible to prevent the outbreak of Newcastle disease in our birds. But if it breaks out, the impact will be reduced if you did vaccinations. Now, for you to have an effective vaccination programme, when you have chicks which hatch, these should be vaccinated at three days old, and you can also give them another dose at six weeks. As they grow, and you hear about the outbreak of Newcastle disease here and there, you can continue vaccinating, but at three days, six weeks, eighteen weeks, you can vaccinate your birds. Kakunta	And what vaccines are we talking about here? Daka	There are various types depending on the brands. Usually it looks like a tablet, you dissolve it. The most popular one is [administered] by drinking water. But the challenge in Newcastle vaccination, is that you have maintain a cold chain. You must not expose the vaccine to heat or sun rays, because you will destroy the vaccine and you will render it useless ? it loses its potency. But I understand there is a Newcastle vaccine which is stable under ambient temperature. It means you don?t need any cold chain, and this vaccine was established in Australia. We have tried to bring it, maybe it?s the cost, but it is the most effective vaccine. Anybody can carry it and mix it with water and vaccinate the chickens under normal temperature. As of now, what we do is, most of these vaccination campaigns for chickens is now thrown to the private sector. We have a lot of vets in Zambia; whoever wishes to vaccinate chickens, he can just buy the vaccine and they go in the villages and vaccinate. This is what we normally do. Kakunta	But this is a very expensive venture for an individual, Mr Daka. Daka	Unfortunately you have to invest for you to gain more. This is what we normally do. We have privatised our veterinary services, so we have invited most private vets to come on board and take up some of these clinical issues in our livestock sector. The only problem I see is that these doses, there may be in 1000 doses, it means you have to vaccinate 1000 chickens. So this is the problem, a farmer has got only maybe five chickens, but even then in the villages you can team up, you share the vaccine, you can vaccinate 1000 chickens. So it wouldn?t be expensive. Kakunta	Apart from protecting these birds against disease, what other important factors do you consider are paramount for successful raising of village chickens? Daka	You know, people complain that village chickens do not lay eggs during the rainy season. But somebody would assume that during the rainy season is when {{we have a lot of}} food. Unfortunately during the rainy season in this country we don?t have enough food for chickens. So my advice is that, when you are approaching the rainy season, like in November, farmers should keep enough maize bran, <b>soya</b> bean <b>cakes,</b> which they can mix to feed the chickens during the rainy season. They will be able to lay and grow and fatten, so that you don?t face any problem. Kakunta	And that can also be part of your prevention against diseases? Daka	Of course. A better fed animal will resist diseases. If your animal is not well fed, it is weak, the immunity goes down. Just like you, if you are not well fed whatever drug you may take it will not work in your body, because it is not complemented by good nutrition. So you must feed well. End of track.

40|$|Caring for chicks Cue: When rearing chickens, {{either for}} eggs or meat, most poultry farmers buy young chicks, often called ?day old chicks?, from a hatchery. These young birds are very vulnerable, {{and must be}} {{protected}} by the farmer against cold and disease. In particular, the chicks must be kept completely separate from adult birds on the farm, and if possible, people working with the adult birds should not enter the chicks? ?brooder house?. This will help {{to ensure that no}} diseases are transmitted to the chicks. Farmers must also pay attention to vaccination, feed and water requirements, so that the young birds grow strong and healthy. Bob Akinwumi is a poultry farmer who keeps layer hens on his farm in Nigeria. Tunde Fatunde spoke to him about how he cares for his day old chicks IN:		?For the day old chick ? OUT:		?. we do not mix. ? DUR?N		 5 ? 36 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Bob Akinwumi was talking to Tunde Fatunde. Transcript Akinwumi	For the day old chick you have to carve out a space that is well protected against cold. So that you put in your day old chick here with some heat source to give them the warmth for two weeks. If you go to acquire, which most of us do, from the hatchery, some hatcheries may be as far as a thousand kilometres away because some of the day old chicks come from Europe, from France for example. You assume that these birds have been put under certain stress so immediately after their arrival they are treated against stress by giving them a solution of sugar and water. Fatunde	What next? Akinwumi	Now the next day what we do by experience is we do not start the day old chick with the chicken feed. We crush some maize and give this to them because we realise from experience the day old chick are very susceptible to constipation when they are introduced to the new feed immediately. So you keep them on maize only. Fatunde	For how long? Akinwumi	Just for a day. Fatunde	And then what next? Akinwumi	On the third day you introduce your normal feed, the starter feed. The starter feed is different from the growing feed because they are richer in protein. And when you have the adequate formula you can put this together yourself. Fatunde	So what do you do yourself? Akinwumi	You go to the market to buy the ingredients like maize which is about 60 % of your feed mixture. You get the <b>Soya</b> bean <b>cake,</b> cotton seed cake, these are to boost the protein content. You add some fishmeal, which you also get from the market. You add some pulverised seashells or animal bone, crushed animal bone to improve the calcium content of your feed. You add some salt for the mineral and then you put in some additives which are already premixed from the pharmacy shop, from the veterinary shop. Fatunde	Now you do that for what space of time? Akinwumi	The starter feed is for {{just a couple of weeks}} between the second day to about two weeks after. Two weeks after they are removed from this special room where they are kept warm and put in your normal rearing deep litter shed and then you can start them off with your growers feed. Fatunde	What do you mean by grower feeds? Akinwumi	Grower feed is the feed they feed on to develop before they start laying which is also a little different in formulation to the starter. Fatunde	Yes what is the difference and what is grower feed?????. Akinwumi	The difference is that the birds can now tolerate? [...] Fatunde	They can easily digest? Akinwumi	They can digest easily the cotton seed which you do not put in a larger quantity for the day old chick. Fatunde	Now lets talk about diseases. These day old chicks, are they susceptible to diseases? Akinwumi	Yes poultry is very very susceptible to diseases and there are many kinds of diseases. Fatunde	Yes and what are these diseases? Akinwumi	The common diseases around here are the Gumboro, the Newcastle, the Infectious Bronchitis which is the infection of the breathing system. There is the coccidiosis which is easily transmitted from one bird to the other through their droppings and the fowl pox. Fatunde	Do you have to wait for these diseases to manifest themselves or you go ahead and do preventive? Akinwumi	Usually a poultry farmer should prevent his birds [getting sick] from day one. Fatunde	Ok now what are these??? [...] Akinwumi	As soon as the day old chicks come in from the second day onwards there is a table to be followed, a table that tells you the kind of vaccine that should be used periodically for your birds to prevent them from contracting these common diseases. Fatunde	Yes and is it you who applies these vaccines and drugs or do you do it with the help of?? [...] Akinwumi	Yes, yes they are easily applied because most of these vaccines are - some of them are injectable - but you can also go for liquid that you can push into their drinking water and makes it very easy. Fatunde	Do you also boost the immunity or you boost the energy of these day old chicks with vitamins? Akinwumi	Yes what you usually do in poultry, since you are subjecting your birds to all kinds of vaccines it is assumed that these vaccines are another source of stress for the birds. So to help the animal to overcome this stress every time you introduce a vaccine you cover it up by giving them vitamins. Fatunde	Have you had any cause to mix old and new birds together? Akinwumi	No this is never done. Fatunde	Why? Akinwumi	We avoid doing this in my farm because usually you find out that the old birds have the tendency of claiming the landlordship of the area where they are and therefore the tendency is to attack the new birds. That?s the first thing. The second thing will be, it will not be advisable if even if they are tolerable because you risk transferring of infection from the old birds to the smaller birds, or to the new birds. Fatunde	So you don?t do it? Akinwumi	We do not mix. End of track. Bob Akinwumi, who keeps layer hens, describes the feeding and disease control methods he uses in raising day old chicks...|$|R
40|$|Risks and {{uncertainty}} of the future are two of numerous key drivers that decision makers need {{to take into account}} when considering opportunities and embarking on new business ventures. As with all agricultural industries, another few factors that need to be considered during decision-making are the pressure of food security, weather changes, input and output price volatility, changes in consumer preference and political instability. Farmers of the 21 st century are becoming business executives of their farming enterprises. The rules of the farming industry, and particularly the South African pork industry, are rapidly changing. Information on trends regarding future possibilities is changing the way that pork producers used to do business and view the industry. Economic analysis, animal health, production, genetics and feed utilisation are the standards to measure and evaluate performance for current pork producers and new entrants to the industry. The objective of this study is based on the economic principles that examine feed price sensitivity and the associated commodity risks in a pork production unit. These principles are applied in the evaluation of possible risk aversion alternatives. This was achieved by redesigning an out-dated pork price-sensitivity model to produce outputs that are of value to decision makers in the industry. These outputs assist in testing different risk aversion alternatives that are available to a pork producer to hedge input cost risks in order to achieve a sustainable profit margin and the ability to expand operations in a sustainable way. The main objective {{of this study was to}} redesign a feed input price-sensitivity model for pork producers who mainly use home mixing of feeds. Risks directly affecting feed costs and thus profit margins, needed to be identified and different risk-minimising strategies and alternatives evaluated and tested on a farm level. Scenarios based on possible price ranges of commodities were calculated, as well as the impact and scale that fluctuations in these prices could possibly have on a pork producer’s profit levels. Redesigning the pork price-sensitivity model was achieved by using the principle of a dynamic approach to modelling, whereby all varying factors and inputs can be captured in an MS Excel setup according to changes in industry prices and dynamics. This application was a requirement because of the high volatility of the input commodity price for the major feed commodities such as maize, sunflower and <b>soya</b> oil <b>cakes,</b> and wheat bran. As part of this study, the following economic applications were combined to answer the research questions. These applications included the market environment for South African pork production, strategic planning, scenario analysis and hedging feed commodity prices with options as well as alternative pricing contracts. Risks classified as priority and of highest concern in the pig industry in South Africa were price volatility in especially the grain market of feed commodities, financial and economic instability and the political [instability] risk. These risks needed to be factored into the decision-making and strategic planning process when the model outputs were evaluated. The methodology applies was to measure the sensitivity that feed commodities have on the gross income (income minus feed cost at a predetermined price for commodities and quantity level), the principle of price elasticity was applied, by using the changes in commodity prices over the changes in gross income. The sensitivity of yellow maize, soya (full fat and oil cake), and sunflower and wheat bran was tested to determine the impact that these commodities individually contribute to the overall feed cost in a pork unit. From the price elasticity and sensitivity calculations and evaluations, it became clear that volume, in conjunction with commodity cost, are important considerations on which decisions from a managerial perspective can be based. A pork producer can choose to be price-elastic/-inelastic according to the levels of sensitivity towards price changes consistent with his/her preference to risk. The scenarios illustrated the risk that a producer can face on an annual basis, and which commodities have the biggest impact on profit levels when prices fluctuate. Maize was seen as being the highest contributor and risk to upward/downward movements. Different alternatives to hedging price risks on the market were tested and the impact of making a decision in the market illustrated. From these calculations, it was clear that each alternative yielded its own risks and opportunities. The minimum price option posed the lowest risk, although a premium is paid, it still allows a pork producer to benefit from rising prices. The recommendation to the pork industry is to expand the study of the industry on a financial basis. Due to recent changes to the National Credit Act (No. 34 of 2005) on the regulation of credit, credit management are becoming stricter from a financial institutional point of view. A producer must be able to prove that his/her farm is sustainable and does not pose a risk to the institution granting the loan. Loan grant decision makers are not always knowledgeable about the different farming industries and practices. It is therefore important that this model is used to identify risks and that the results, together with an indication of how these risks will be dealt with given different market scenarios, are included in pork producers business plans. Other recommendations included the following: This study should be used by decision makers in SAPPO and the industry to base decisions regarding the economic value of production on; Home mixers should evaluate the financial impact if inputs in their existing feeding system change, as well as possible ways in which these changes might affect their cash flow; Producers should acquire a better understanding of SAFEX in the industry by obtaining more case study examples of how hedging risks could be applied to the advantage of a pork producer; Technology should be used more frequently to communicate relevant and updated market information to role players to equip them for decision-making processes on current and future market developments and scope; Opportunities to engage in pork meat price futures contracts (trades as pork bellies in the US) should be investigated to give open market producers a tool to contract their products in the future; Consumer trends needs to be analysed and constantly revised to ensure that producers will be able to deliver products in line with the needs of future consumers; and Interdisciplinary relationships with respect to animal science, animal health nutrition, agricultural economics, soil science, SAFEX and offset markets should be fully incorporated in the outputs. This will facilitate the true delivery of an exact research output that can be used by role players in the applicable industry to base good judgement decisions on in future. AFRIKAANS : Risiko’s en onsekerheid is twee van vele sleutelareas wat besluitnemers in ag moet neem wanneer hulle geleenthede oorweeg en nuwe besigheidsgeleenthede ontgin. Soos met alle sektore in die landbou, is nog ‘n faktore wat tydens besluitneming in gedagte gehou moet word onder andere die druk van voedselsekuriteit, weerveranderings, prysvolatiliteit van in- en uitsette, veranderings in verbruikersvoorkeure en politieke onstabiliteit. Boere van die 21 ste eeu is besig om hoof uitvoerende beamptes van hulle eie boerdery-ondernemings te word. Die spelreëls van boerdery, en spesifiek die Suid-Afrikaanse varkindustrie, is besig om vinnig te verander. Inligting oor huidige tendense, wat toekomstige moontlikhede inhou, verander die manier waarop varkprodusente besigheid doen en die industrie beskou. Ekonomiese analises, in kombinasie met dieregesondheid, produksiegenetika en voeding, word die winsdrywers en meet-instrumente waarteen huidige varkprodusente sowel as nuwe toetreders in die industrie hulself kan meet. Die fokus van hierdie studie word gebaseer op die ekonomiese beginsels wat voedingspryssensitiwiteit en die gepaardgaande kommoditeitsrisiko’s in ‘n varkproduksie-eenheid ondersoek. Hierdie beginsels word aangewend in die evaluasie van moontlike risiko-vermydingsalternatiewe. Dit is bereik deur die herontwerp van ‘n verouderde varkpryssensitiewe model om waardevolle uitsette vir die varkprodusente industrie te lewer. Hierdie uitsette help met die toetsing van verskeie risiko-bestuursalternatiewe wat vir die varkprodusent beskibaar is om insetkosterisiko’s te verskans en sodoende ‘n volhoubare winsgrens en die vermoë om werksaamhede op volhoubare wyse uit te brei, te bereik. Die hoofdoelwit van die studie was om ‘n voedingspryssensitiewe model vir varkprodusente wat voer hoofsaaklik tuis meng, te herontwerp. Risiko’s wat voedingskostes en dus winsgrense direk affekteer, moet geïdentifiseer word en verskillende strategië en alternatiewe om risiko’s te beperk moet op plaasvlak geëvalueer en getoets word. Scenarios gebaseer op moontlike kommoditeitsprysreekse is bereken, sowel as die impak en skaal wat skommelings in hierdie pryse moontlik op ‘n varkprodusent se winsgrense tot gevolg kan hê. Die herontwerp van die varkpryssensitiewe model is bereik deur die gebruik van die beginsel van ‘n dinamiese benadering van modellering, waarby alle wisselende faktore en insette in ‘n MS Excel-spreiblad ingevoer kan word, volgens veranderinge in industriepryse en -dinamika. Hierdie toepassing was ‘n vereiste as gevolg van die volatiele aard van insetkommoditeitspryse van die hoofvoedingskommoditeite soos mielies, sonneblom- en soja-oliekoeke en koringsemels. As deel van hierdie studie, is die volgende elemente gekombineer: die markomgewing, strategiese beplanning, scenario-analise, verskansing met afgeleide instrumente (deur gebruik te maak van termyn- en opsiekontrakte) asook alternatiewe aankoopkontrakte. Prysvolatiliteit in veral die graanmark; finansiële en ekonomiese onstabiliteit; en die politieke [onstabiliteit] is geïdentifiseer as die hoogste risikofaktore in die vark-industrie. Daar moet rekening gehou word met hierdie risiko’s tydens die besluitnemings- en strategiese beplanningsproses. Om die sensitiwiteit te meet wat voerkommoditeite op die bruto inkomste het, is die beginsel van pryselastisiteit toegepas deur die veranderinge in kommoditeitspryse oor die veranderinge in bruto inkomste te gebruik. Die sensitiwiteit van geelmielies, soja (volvet en oliekoek), sonneblom en koringsemels is getoets om die impak te bepaal wat hierdie kommoditeite individueel bydra tot die oorkoepelende voerkoste in ‘n varkeenheid. Uit die pryselastisiteits- en sensitiwiteitsberekenings en -evaluasies het dit duidelik geword dat volume, tesame met graanpryse, belangrike oorwegings is waarop besluite uit ‘n bestuursperspektief gebaseer moet word. ‘n Varkprodusent kan kies om pryselasties of -onelastis te wees volgens sy/haar vlakke van sensitiwiteit teenoor prysveranderinge in ooreenstemming met sy/haar risikovoorkeur. Die scenario’s het die risiko geïllustreer wat ‘n produsent op jaarlikse basis kan trotseer en watter kommoditeite die grootste impak op wins het wanneer pryse wissel. Mielies blyk die grootste impak en dus ook risiko, met op- en afwaartse bewegings te wees. Verskeie alternatiewe tot die inperking van prysrisiko’s op die mark is getoets en die impak van besluitneming in die mark geïllustreer. Uit hierdie berekeninge was dit duidelik dat elke alternatief sy eie riskso’s en geleenthede voortbring. Alhoewel ‘n premie betaal is, hou die minimumprys-strategie die laagste risiko vir varkprodusente in deurdat dit steeds ‘n produsent toelaat om voordeel uit wisselende pryse te trek. Daar word aanbeveel dat die studie uitgebrei word om ook die finansiële posisie van 'n varkprodusent in die besluitnemingsmodel in te sluit. Na aanleiding aan die onlangse veranderings aan die Nasionale-kredietwet (Wet No. 34 van 2005), word kredietbestuur strenger toegepas. ‘n Produsent moet in staat wees om te kan bewys dat sy/haar besigheid volhoubaar is en nie ‘n risiko inhou vir die instansie wat die lening toestaan nie. Besluitnemers wat lenings toeken is nie altyd ingelig oor die verskillende boerderyindustrië en -gebruike nie. Dit is daarom belangrik dat hierdie model gebruik word om risiko’s te identifiseer en dat die resultate (produksie en finansies), tesame met ‘n aanduiding van hoe hierdie risiko’s hanteer moet word gegewe verskillende markscenario’s, ingesluit moet word in varkprodusente se besigheidsplanne. Ander aanbevelings sluit die volgende in: Hierdie studie behoort deur besluitnemers in SAPPO en die industrie gebruik te word om besluite met betrekking tot die ekonomiese waarde van produksie op te baseer; Tuismengers behoort die finansiële impak te evalueer indien insette in hulle huidige voedingstelsel verander, sowel as moontlike maniere waarop hierdie veranderinge hulle kontantvloei en winsgewendheid kan affekteer; Produsente behoort ‘n beter begrip oor SAFEX in die industrie te verkry deur meer gevallestudies te bekom oor hoe om die inperking van risiko’s toe te pas tot voordeel van ‘n varkprodusent; Tegnologie behoort meer gereeld gebruik te word om toepaslike en die nuutste markinligting aan rolspelers te kommunikeer om hulle sodoende toe te rus vir besluitnemingsprosesse; Geleenthede om betrokke te raak by varkvleistermynkontrakte behoort ondersoek te word om varkprodusente in staat te stel om ook hul uitsette te verskans; Verbruikersneigings behoort ontleed en voortdurend hersien te word om te verseker dat produsente in staat sal wees om produkte te lewer ooreenkomstig die behoeftes van verbruikers; en Interdissiplinêre verhoudings met betrekking tot veekunde, diere-gesondheids¬voeding, landbou-ekonomie, grondkunde, SAFEX en verskansing, behoort ten volle geïnkorporeer te word by die uitsette. In die toekoms sal dit die lewering van ‘n presiese navorsingsuitset kan fasiliteer wat deur rolspelers in die toepaslike industrie gebruik kan word om goeie oordeelkundige besluite op te baseer.

To help meet the food needs of city dwellers, battery farms modelled on those in industrialized countries have been developed over the last twenty years with considerable success. Poultry farming in rural areas, however, remains highly traditional and has hardly been improved {{despite the fact that it}} still provides the bulk of production. Although most farming households in Africa generally keep a few chickens, poultry breeding remains for them only a secondary activity. It simply enables some ready cash to be brought in when needed by selling off a little of the capital that such birds represent for most farmers. Of more importance is the social significance of such flocks, given the fact that chickens are traditionally used as presents or tokens of exchange and make up the main dish that is served during certain festivities. Poultry consumption in rural areas is however, generally limited to such festive occasions and is estimated to be no more than one or two chickens per person per year. As for eggs, their consumption is severely limited by food habits and certain taboos. Under these conditions, poultry farming remains a supplementary source of income and thus must not incur any additional costs. It is almost like having a flock of wild birds as there are no breeding costs and they maintain themselves on readily available resources. These free-range chickens feed on kitchen waste, crop leftovers, grain residues, insects and some grass in the rainy season. Farmers occasionally trap termites for young chickens, but it is extremely rare to feed them grain. The birds are left to roam during the day, either within or around the yard. At night, they are kept inside wattle or straw roosts which are often very small, badly aired and rarely cleaned or repaired. Birds of different species and ages are bunched together indiscriminately under conditions favouring the spread of diseases. Furthermore, eggs are hatched without supervision and are seldom collected. Under these conditions poultry farmers suffer high losses. The birds are attacked by predators, eggs get broken or lost, and chicks often die before they are two months old. Their numbers are regularly reduced by parasites and respiratory diseases. Viral infections such as Newcastle disease are particularly common during the dry season. Their numbers also fluctuate considerably, being higher during the rainy season when climatic conditions are more favourable, and lower during the dry season when mortality is higher and more of them are sold. Most of these flocks consist of native chickens which have long interbred with European breeds. They are generally known as 'African chickens','running chickens' or 'country chickens'. They are usually small and of various colours, and they weigh approximately one kilo when they are sold at the age of six to eight months. A hen lays between 50 and 90 eggs a year. Although such production is relatively low, these birds have the advantage of being very sturdy, resistant to tough climatic conditions and good breeders. Apart from chickens, one also finds guinea fowl that have been domesticated from the various wild strains of the savannah regions. Their genetic adaptation to the local environment is very important under such farming conditions. In order to improve productivity attempts have been made to replace local cocks with improved western breeds, such as Rhode Island or Plymouth Rock. Such initiatives, which began in French-speaking Africa over a decade ago, have not always lived up to expectations. It has not been easy to reach all poultry farmers and thus to eliminate all the local strains of cocks, especially as farmers often prefer to keep birds of different types and colours to meet particular social requirements. In fact, genetic improvement alone will not bring about a substantial increase in production. It must be combined with effective sanitation measures and improvements in feeding and health care. Closer supervision, especially during and after incubation, would also cut losses. The use of better and regularly cleaned hen roosts, the isolation or elimination of sick birds, and the quarantine of new arrivals, would also considerably reduce the incidence of disease. Some NGOs are thus promoting more appropriate roost designs that are easy to build with local materials. Regular vaccination is also necessary to fight epidemics which can destroy entire flocks almost overnight. If farmers are going to increase their poultry production significantly, they must drastically change their feeding methods. This will require educational campaigns to convince them that it is in their interest to feed their chickens. But this is only possible if their other operations provide enough surplus grain or if they can afford to buy commercial feed. This is a feasible proposition as such chickens generally sell well, either directly on local markets or to middlemen who buy on behalf of urban merchants. In fact, free-range chickens are highly valued by urban consumers who prefer them for traditional, stewed dishes. In Dakar, for example, demand often exceeds supply and free-range chickens fetch a higher price than battery chickens. But if poultry farming is to be profitable, transportation methods will have to be improved. Live hens in exposed cages stacked on the roofs of taxis, or hanging by their feet from bicycles or motorcycles, are often the worse for wear, if not dead, on arrival. Those that do survive must then face the poor handling conditions of the markets. Nevertheless, local breeds still account for the bulk of poultry production in Africa, varying from 70 % to 90 % depending on the region. Production in large, modern battery farms is now increasing rapidly in many countries, notably in Cote d'lvoire and Cameroon. This sharp growth in battery farming, supported by governments anxious to supply urban areas and to reduce meat shortages, has been stimulated by numerous financial incentives. Battery chickens differ from local breeds not only in taste, but even more so in their cultural requirements which are similar to those used in Europe. Such intensive poultry farming is most often located on the outskirts of large cities. In Cote d'lvoire, for example, 90 % of this type of farming is concentrated around Abidjan with practically none in rural areas. The smallest of these battery farms have only a few hundred birds, use improved breeds and buy part of their feed. They are owned by city dwellers, merchants or state employees who use them to supplement their incomes. Intensive poultry farms are hardly ever owned by small farmers, except where charitable organizations or NGOs have provided financial assistance. Since few of the operators have been specifically trained for the job, feeding and sanitation standards are often DOor. Huge battery farms also exist, housing thousands or tens of thousands of birds. These are sometimes known as 'chicken cathedrals' and have been set up by large European firms. The largest of these operate as completely integrated concerns with the same company taking care of everything from hatching to sale, including feed and medecine supply slaughtering and marketing. Others are only partially integrated feed stuff, chicks and training are provided, but the farmer is in charge of everything else, including market~ng. All of these farms use improved genetic strains. Chicks are provided from breeds which have been especially selected for egg or meat production. Other commercial criteria, often of a psychological nature, such as the colour of the eggs or feet, are also taken into consideration. Rhode Island hens, which produce coloured eggs, are highly valued in West African countries. A more important factor is the use of breeds that are adapted to both the climate and the type of feed provided. Those that come from the few major world breeders often do not have characteristics appropriate to tropical environments. Large goodlaying hens, for example, suffer from the heat. Much better are small hens, such as the 'Vedette' with its dwarfism gene, or bare neck hens, which adapt more easily to high temperatures. It is also advisable to choose birds with a sound appetite that will ensure an adequate food intake even when hot weather reduces the desire to eat. Although the use of incubators has spread recently in most countries, there are often still not enough to be able to provide battery farms with adequate supplies of day-old chicks. They thus have to be flown in from abroad which is very expensive and risky. Those chicks that do survive the stressful journey often arrive in such a state that their initial growth is severly compromized. These battery farms use feed which is prepared locally but consists of a large proportion of imported ingredients to which locally available raw materials are added wherever possible. The use of <b>soya</b> and maize <b>cakes,</b> minerals and vitamins from Europe or the United States results in a considerable drain on foreign reserves and problems of storage and supply interruptions. Imported raw materials account for nearly 50 % of the cost of a chicken. The same is true for medicines, which are rarely produced entirely in the country. On the other hand, local resources are often under-exploited and little work has been done on how to make better use of them or how to ensure a higher and more consistent quality. Many products nevertheless deserve to be more widely used: cassava, molasses, rice by-products, copra and palm cakes and, of course, cotton or ground-nut cakes Many of these products go to waste, yet they could, to a large extent, replace imported products and increase the much needed self-sufficiency in feed stocks. African battery poultry farming thus remains highly dependent on foreign supplies and technical expertise. The building designs used are often copied from European models which are obviously not always appropriate for hot countries. It would be preferable to construct buildings which are better ventilated, have better heat protection, more drinking troughs and less densely-populated hen houses. Although African battery farms are considerably more productive than poultry farming in the countryside, they do not achieve the levels of productivity of European chicken factories as the birds fatten less quickly and lay fewer and smaller eggs. Heat and the rapid spread of microbial infections in humid regions are the main reasons for this. Productivity would be improved if battery farms were located in cooler areas such as uplands. In spite of some negative results, intensive poultry farming has developed spectacularly over the last decade as it remains the only way of rapidly meeting demand. However, prices are still high for the consumer and the commercial market, serving essentially Europeans and wellto-do Africans, is likely to become saturated unless prices come down. Moreover frozen chicken imported directly from industrialized countries is beginning to make considerable inroads on this same rich man's market. These products, heavily subsidized by the exporting countries, are often less expensive in ACP countries than locally-produced chicken. There has also been an increase in the production and consumption of eggs but their market does not extend beyond urban areas. Although modern poultry farming is capable of providing high protein food for towns, it is still too expensive and dependent on external factors. Applied research on the food value of local raw materials and the training of competent personnel are needed if self-sufficiency is to be ensured. At some time, traditional poultry farming, relying solely on local resources, is a potential source of considerable production. But it has so far been underestimated. increased information and extension programmes, improved sanitation, and better marketing and distribution networks would enable traditional poultry farming to make a more significant contribution to both the village and the national economy Such chicken production will never be able to meet urban needs, but the towns can become a real market for small producers who could obtain considerable extra income without competing with battery farms. What then is the solution ? Should one increase production in order to develop the market? Or develop the market in order to increase production ? It really isn't a question of which comes first, the chicken or the egg, but rather of the willingness to ensure that poultry farming is given a major role in projects and aid.
