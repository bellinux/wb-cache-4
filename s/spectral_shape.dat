25|$|The <b>spectral</b> <b>shape</b> and {{intensity}} of the optical signals from the N-V− centers are sensitive to external perturbation, such as temperature, strain, electric and magnetic field. However, the use of <b>spectral</b> <b>shape</b> for sensing those perturbation is impractical, as the diamond {{would have to be}} cooled to cryogenic temperatures to sharpen the N-V− signals. A more realistic approach is to use luminescence intensity (rather than lineshape), which exhibits a sharp resonance when a microwave frequency is applied to diamond that matches the splitting of the ground state levels. The resulting optically detected magnetic resonance signals are sharp even at room temperature, and can be used in miniature sensors. Such sensors can detect magnetic fields of a few nanotesla or electric fields of about 10 V/cm at kilohertz frequencies after 100 seconds of averaging. This sensitivity allows detecting a magnetic or electric field produced by a single electron located tens of nanometers away from an N-V− center.|$|E

This classification has since been expanded to include many other asteroid types. The number of types continues to grow as more asteroids are studied.|$|E

2500|$|An {{alternative}} {{method of obtaining}} a bell-shaped <b>spectral</b> <b>shape</b> {{in order to achieve}} lower sidelobes, is to sweep the frequency band in a non-linear manner. [...] The required characteristic is obtained by having rapid changes in frequency near to the band edges, with a slower rate of change around band centre. [...] This is a more efficient way of achieving the required <b>spectral</b> <b>shape</b> than by applying amplitude weighting to the spectrum of the linear chirp because no attenuation of signal power is necessary in order to achieve it. [...] In addition, the procedure gives far-out sidelobes that tend to be lower than those for the comparable linear sweep version. [...] As the mathematics of non-linear chirps is more complicated than that of linear chirps, many early workers resorted to stationary phase methods to design them.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} achieve the {{required}} <b>spectral</b> <b>shape</b> for low time sidelobes, linear chirps require amplitude weighting and consequently incur a mismatch loss. [...] Non-linear chirps, however, have the advantage that by achieving the spectral shaping directly, close-in sidelobe levels can be made low with negligible mismatch loss (typically less than 0.1dB). [...] Another benefit is that the far out sidelobes, due to Fresnel ripples on the spectrum, tend to be lower than for a linear chirp with the same T×B product (4 to 5dB lower with large T×B).|$|E
2500|$|A way of {{reducing}} the susceptibility of non-linear chirps to Doppler {{is to use a}} ‘hybrid’ scheme, where part of the <b>spectral</b> <b>shaping</b> is achieved by a non-linear sweep, but with additional <b>spectral</b> <b>shaping</b> achieved by amplitude weighting.

2500|$|In the two {{examples}} below, the chirps have a non-linear sweep characteristic which gives a spectrum with Taylor weighting which, used alone, will achieve a sidelobe level of -20dB on its compressed pulses. [...] To achieve lower level sidelobes, this <b>spectral</b> <b>shape</b> is augmented by amplitude weighting {{so that the}} final target sidelobe level for the compressed pulses is -50dB. [...] Comparing the results for Doppler shifts of 10kHz and 100kHz with those shown earlier it is seen that the new spurious sidelobes, caused by the Doppler, are seen to be 6dB lower than before. [...] However, the mismatch loss has increased from 0.1dB to 0.6dB, but this is still better than the 1.6dB figure for linear chirps.|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} a {{non-linear}} chirp pulse {{and the effects of}} Doppler are shown [...] The non-linear characteristic is chosen to achieve -50dB sidelobes using Taylor weighting. [...] The first figure shows the compressed pulse for a non-linear chirp, with bandwidth 10MHz, pulse duration 10usec, so T×B = 100, and with no Doppler shift. [...] The next two figures shows the pulse degradation cause by 10kHz and 100kHz Doppler, respectively. [...] In addition to the waveform degradation, the mismatch loss increases to 0.5dB. [...] The final figure shows the effect of 100kHz Doppler on a linear chirp which has had amplitude weighting applied to give the same <b>spectral</b> <b>shape</b> as that of the non-linear chirp.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Spectral</b> <b>shaping</b> {{codes are}} digital codes {{especially}} designed {{in such a}} manner that their alphabets give rise to predetermined frequency spectrum envelopes. This implies that the signal energy of these alphabets will be concentrated into a predetermined range of a given frequency spectrum. The design of digital codes in the above mentioned fashion is done in order to match specific channel constraints in the design of transmission, multiplexing or storage systems. In certain applications it is desirable that <b>spectral</b> <b>shaping</b> codes provide some error correction capability or that they possess an increased robustness to errors. These errors may be introduced during transmission, processing or storage of digital information. In this paper, an interleaving method is introduced to increase the robustness of DC free codes toward burst errors whilst maintaining the <b>spectral</b> <b>shaping</b> property of DC free codes. Interleaving when applied to a coded communication system results in a reduction in the mean bit error rate (BER) of coded bit streams...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. After a short {{discussion}} of all conventional core level spectroscopies within the single particle model, {{the effects of}} the coupling of the core and valence wave function on the x-ray emission <b>spectral</b> <b>shapes</b> is discussed. It will be shown that these so-called multiplet effects strongly affect all x-ray emission spectra taken around the metal 2 p resonances. In case of 1 s resonances, valence band x-ray emission is not affected, but the <b>spectral</b> <b>shapes</b> of 1 s 2 p and 1 s 3 p x-ray emission can only be sensibly described with the inclusion of multiplets. A special example is the resonant excitation into the pre-edge region, which gives rise to a quadrupole resonance.
