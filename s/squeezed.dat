50|$|In {{the card}} game {{contract}} bridge, an entry-shifting <b>squeeze</b> {{is a mixture}} between a material <b>squeeze</b> and an immaterial <b>squeeze.</b> The material part {{is the same as}} in a trump <b>squeeze</b> or a <b>squeeze</b> without the count. The immaterial part is that depending on the choice of discards of the squeezee an entry into one or into the other hand is created. For that very reason an entry-shifting <b>squeeze</b> is always a positional <b>squeeze.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{knockout}} <b>squeeze</b> is a <b>squeeze</b> {{in three}} suits, {{one of which}} is the trump suit. The defender's trump holding is needed to prevent declarer from making a successful play involving trumps, including one as prosaic as ruffing a loser. Because the knockout <b>squeeze</b> does not threaten to promote declarer's trumps to winners (they are often already of winning rank) it is termed a non-material <b>squeeze.</b> Other non-material <b>squeezes</b> include entry <b>squeezes,</b> single-suit <b>squeezes</b> and winkles.|$|R

5|$|A lemon drop is a {{cocktail}} with a lemony, {{sweet and sour}} flavor, whereby the sweet and sour ingredients serve to contrast and balance one another. It is a vodka-based cocktail that is prepared {{with the addition of}} lemon juice, triple sec and simple syrup. Plain or citrus-flavored vodka may be used in its preparation, such as citron vodka. Lemon-flavored vodka is also sometimes used. Lemon juice that has been freshly <b>squeezed</b> may be used, which can produce a superior drink compared to using commercially prepared lemon juice. Some versions are prepared using the juice from Meyer lemons.|$|E
5|$|A pisco sour is an {{alcoholic}} cocktail of Peruvian origin that {{is typical of}} the cuisines from Chile and Peru, considered also a South American classic. The drink's name comes from pisco, which is its base liquor, and the cocktail term sour, in reference to sour citrus juice and sweetener components. The Peruvian pisco sour uses Peruvian pisco as the base liquor and adds freshly <b>squeezed</b> lime juice, syrup, ice, egg white, and Angostura bitters. The Chilean version is similar, but uses Chilean pisco and pica lime, and excludes the bitters and egg white. Other variants of the cocktail include those created with fruits like pineapple or plants such as coca leaves.|$|E
40|$|In this Letter {{we study}} the {{evolution}} of the higher-order <b>squeezing,</b> namely, nthorder single-mode <b>squeezing,</b> sum- and difference-squeezing for the codirectional Kerr nonlinear coupler. We show that the amount of <b>squeezing</b> decreases when n, i. e. the <b>squeezing</b> order, increases. For specific values of the interaction parameters <b>squeezing</b> factors exhibit a series of revival-collapse phenomena, which become more pronounced when the value of n increases. Sum-squeezing can provide amounts of <b>squeezing</b> greater than those produced by the nth higher-order (n ≥ 2) <b>squeezing</b> for the same values of interaction parameters and can map onto amplitude-squared <b>squeezing.</b> Further, we prove that the difference-squeezing is not relevant measure for obtaining information about <b>squeezing</b> from this device...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{functional}} automotive part, reaction shaft support, was fabricated {{by local}} <b>squeeze</b> and vacuum Diecasting (LSVD) with light-weight Al- 15 %Si hypereutectic alloy which has good fluidity and excellent wear resistance. The effects of local <b>squeezing</b> pressure and time-lag of LSVD process on the microstructure {{of the product}} were investigated. Measurement of specific gravity with the change of local <b>squeeze</b> pressure and time-lag showed that the local <b>squeezing</b> effect can be increased by increasing <b>squeeze</b> pressure and decreasing time-lag. However, too high a <b>squeeze</b> pressure and too a low time-lag brought about insufficient <b>squeezing</b> effect due to instant movement to the <b>squeeze</b> plunger stroke end point. Through the combination of vacuum suction before melt injection and local <b>squeezing</b> after melt injection in LSVD process, light-weight Al- 15 %Si alloy reaction shaft support was successfully developed, resulting in excellent microstructural and mechanical propertie...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{analyzes}} the relevance and {{the scope of}} price <b>squeeze</b> tests in a regulatory environment. We distinguish between three types of ex ante regulation (full, partial or no regulation) to identify the following types of price squeeze: regulatory <b>squeezes,</b> predatory <b>squeezes,</b> and <b>squeezes</b> as foreclosure. We argue that policy makers should use price <b>squeeze</b> tests as an ex post instrument, compatible with the ex ante regulatory environment. Our analysis implies that policy makers should focus on predatory price <b>squeezes.</b> We propose a predatory <b>squeeze</b> test that respects regulatory choices {{that have been made}} previously, in contrast with the earlier proposed tests. We extend our framework to ask at which aggregation level predatory price <b>squeeze</b> tests ought to be applied, a much-debated issue in telecommunications...|$|R

However, much of the land on the peninsula is quite mountainous and not suited for development; the population density of the individual settlements, which are <b>squeezed</b> into the small bay areas {{in the foothills of the}} mountains, is much higher. Extrapolating from data based on the most recent land survey, only 3.21% of the town's land is inhabited; this puts the population density at a much higher 3,510 persons/kilometer-squared.|$|E

In reaction to going a goal down, Ferguson substituted in Solskjær and Sheringham. As the game went to injury time, referee Pierluigi Collina indicated that three minutes would be played. In almost the last attack of the game, United won a corner, which Beckham took and goalkeeper Schmeichel went up front for.

5|$|Sponges {{have three}} asexual methods of reproduction: after fragmentation; by budding; and by {{producing}} gemmules. Fragments of sponges may be detached by currents or waves.

The same capabilities enable sponges that have been <b>squeezed</b> through a fine cloth to regenerate. A sponge fragment can only regenerate if it contains both collencytes to produce mesohyl and archeocytes to produce all the other cell types. A very few species reproduce by budding.|$|E
