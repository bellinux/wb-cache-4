5|$|These {{designs for}} the uniform, however, did not prevail, as the {{complexity}} of the uniform proved to be difficult for mass-production. The simpler uniform {{turned out to be the}} regulations dictated by Judah Benjamin. He stated that the uniform <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> of: a gray jacket; a blue, gray, or brown pair of trousers; any slouch hat or cap-type of head cover; and any kind of foot-wear to be worn for Confederate service in mid-1861. His regulations, however, were overruled by the subsequent set of regulations of June 1861, stating the Franco-Austrian styled uniform to be issued and purchased to all corps and by all officers, respectively.|$|E

25|$|The general {{appearance}} of the Sheltie {{is that of a}} miniature Rough Collie. They are a small, double coated, working dog, agile and sturdy. Blue merle Shelties may have blue eyes or one brown and one blue eye, but all others have dark colored eyes. Their expression <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> of alertness with a gentle and sometimes reserved nature. They are often very good with children. They carry their tail down low, only lifted when alert and never carried over the back. They are an intensely loyal breed, sometimes reserved with strangers but should not be shy or showing timidness as per the AKC breed standard.|$|E

25|$|Common intuition {{suggests}} that if a fair coin is tossed many times, then roughly half {{of the time it}} will turn up heads, and the other half it will turn up tails. Furthermore, the more often the coin is tossed, the more likely it <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the ratio of the number of heads to the number of tails will approach unity. Modern probability theory provides a formal version of this intuitive idea, known as the law of large numbers. This law is remarkable because it is not assumed in the foundations of probability theory, but instead emerges from these foundations as a theorem. Since it links theoretically derived probabilities to their actual frequency of occurrence in the real world, the law of large numbers is considered as a pillar in the history of statistical theory and has had widespread influence.|$|E
25|$|The {{historian}} Jordanes {{states that}} Attila was enticed by the Vandal king Genseric {{to wage war}} on the Visigoths. At the same time, Genseric would attempt to sow strife between the Visigoths and the Western Roman Empire. However, Jordanes' account of Gothic history is notoriously biased and unreliable, {{and much of it}} is omitted or garbled. Other contemporary writers offer different motivations: Justa Grata Honoria, the sister of the emperor Valentinian III, had been betrothed to the former consul Herculanus the year before. In 450, she sent the eunuch Hyacinthus to the Hunnic king asking for Attila's help in escaping her confinement, with her ring as proof of the letter's legitimacy. Allegedly Attila interpreted it as offering her hand in marriage, and he had claimed half of the empire as a dowry. He demanded Honoria to be delivered along with the dowry. Valentinian rejected these demands, and Attila used it as an excuse to launch a destructive campaign through Gaul. Hughes suggests that the reality of this interpretation <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> Honoria was using Attila's status as honorary Magister Militum for political leverage.|$|E

500|$|... "The Old Man and the Key" [...] {{was written}} by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Lance Kramer. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on March 10, 2002. The idea for the episode was pitched by Vitti, who was inspired by an article about senior homes. The article described senior homes as being a lot like high schools, in that there are popular and unpopular people, and that those who, for example, own a car are [...] "like kings". Vitti suggested that the episode <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> [...] "Grampa's life [...] basically {{like that of a}} teenager", with Homer acting as if he was Grampa's father. The Souvenir Jackitos, who challenge Grampa to a death race in the episode, were conceived from an observation by the writers.

Vianu commented at length on the exact relationship between the narrative borrowed from oral tradition and Creangă's [...] "somewhat surreptitious" [...] method of blending his own style into the folkloric standard, likening it to the historical process whereby local painters improvised over the strict canons of Byzantine art. Creangă's complex take on individuality and the art of writing was attested by the his own foreword to an edition of his collected stories, in which he addressed the reader directly: [...] "You may have read many stupid things since you were put on this Earth.

Clash started working at Sesame Street for ten episodes in 1983, mostly performing nondescript, stand-in puppets known as Anything Muppets. [...] Some of his earliest characters included the saxophone-playing Hoots the Owl (based on Louis Armstrong), the infant Baby Natasha, and inventor Dr. Nobel Price. After 1985, Elmo, a furry red monster, became his main character. Four puppeteers, including Richard Hunt, had performed Elmo previously, but it was Clash's development, with a falsetto voice, that established the character. He based Elmo's character on the preschool children that attended his mother's daycare in Baltimore and upon his own personality and the personality of his parents. [...] Clash followed the advice of fellow puppeteer Frank Oz, who told Clash to always [...] "find one special hook" [...] for each character.

500|$|Pond's {{article was}} viewed {{by some as}} a {{criticism}} of those in the Prairie School who overemphasized the horizontal over the vertical. [...] In this regard, Pond wrote:"In architectural composition, as in music, order is comprehended in rhythm. [...] Rhythm is expressed in the flow of part into part, of mass into mass, in the appearance and reappearance of certain proportions which are made to exist between the subordinate masses and between these masses and the dominant mass; between all the parts of the perfect whole. [...] Without order there is no architecture; without rhythmic composition no vital architecture can be. [...] That is the highest architecture in which rhythmic action of the structural forces becomes apparent. [...] Vertical forces in action, by the law of gravity, tend to work in right lines; horizontal forces, acted upon by this same law tend to work in curves. ... It is not enough that the rhythmic movement be in horizontal direction only, but there must be a rhythmic flow vertically as well. [...] The result of these combined movements <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> of unity -- simple in its effect though complex in its harmonies." ...|$|E

Bogost summed up his review of the game by writing [...] "this game is not fun, it is challenging, and difficult to play—not technically difficult, but conceptually difficult. We need more of that."

On May 3, 1978, Wisconsin's William Proxmire introduced legislation in the Senate which was identical to the Treasury proposal, except for mandating a design which was altered to social reformer Susan B. Anthony in place of the allegorical Liberty. On May 15, Representatives Mary Rose Oakar and Patricia Schroeder introduced similar legislation to the House of Representatives. Anthony was also recommended by members of the National Organization for Women, the Congresswomen's Caucus, the National Women's Political Caucus and the League of Women Voters. In support of the proposed legislation, the League addressed a letter to Walter E. Fauntroy, chairman of the Subcommittee on Historic Preservation and Coinage, reading in part: The League believes that the time has come, and is indeed long past, for the likeness of a prominent American woman to be placed on a denomination of U.S. currency. We believe strongly that the likeness <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> of an actual woman and not that of an imaginary or symbolic figure. Susan B. Anthony contributed immeasurably to the advancement of human dignity in this nation. It is entirely fitting and appropriate that her memory be honored through this measure. In addition, officials tallied suggestions sent to the Mint by the general public as to the subject of the dollar coin, and Susan B. Anthony had received the most support.|$|E
