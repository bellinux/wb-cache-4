In order to corroborate that the biological activity for selenium compounds depends on the chemical form, a broad structural variety is presented. These structures include <b>selenocyanates,</b> diselenides, selenoalkyl functional moieties and eight newly synthesized symmetrically substituted dithioselenites and selenylureas. Eleven of the derivatives tested showed high levels of superoxide generation in vitro via oxidation of reduced glutathione (GSH) and nine of them were more catalytic than the reference compound, diselenodipropionic acid. Eighteen of the library compounds inhibited cell growth more than or similar to reference chemotherapeutic drugs in PC- 3 and eleven were more potent cytotoxic agents than etoposide in the MCF- 7 cell line. Considering both parameters (superoxide generation and cell cytotoxicity) compounds B 1, C 6 and C 9 displayed the best therapeutic profiles. Considering that many diselenide compounds can generate superoxide (O 2 ─) in vitro via oxidation of GSH and other thiols, the analogue B 1, that contains a diselenide moiety, was selected for a preliminary mechanistic investigation, which. revealed that B 1 has apoptogenic effects similar to camptothecin mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in lymphocytic leukemia cells (CCRF-CEM) and affected the MCF- 7 cell-cycle in G 2 /M and S-phases...|$|R

TFs assembled from these thio and <b>selenocyanates</b> {{were characterized by}} six different techniques: electrochemical capacitance (Cp) measurements, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), {{energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy}} (EDX), atomic force microscopy (AFM), x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). Cp experiments were used to confirm the development of TFs on an amorphous Au surface using ethanol or hexanes as a reaction solvent. A sputtered Au surface was observed by SEM/EDX to be an inappropriate surface for TF assembly. TFs assembled onto epitaxially grown Au were characterized by multiple techniques. Large crystallites were observed on TFs assembled from NCSe-T 2 -Hx and NCSe-Hx-T 2 -Hx-SeCN. Chemical maps of these crystallites were obtained through SEM/EDX. The presence of a covalent Au-S or Au-Se bond on the surface was confirmed by XPS signals from the S 2 p 3 / 2 and Se 3 d 5 / 2 / 3 d 3 / 2 regions respectively. XPS signals of ~ 399 eV in the N 1 s region were observed in all assemblies characterized by this technique, indicating the presence of residual gold-bound cyanide (Au(CN) ads) on the surface.

40|$|Three new supramolecular {{networks}} of cobalt(II), [Co(phen) 2 (SeCN) 2] (1), [Co(bpe) 2 (SeCN) 2]n (2), and[Co(bps) 2 (SeCN) 2] H 2 On (3) [phen = 1, 10 -phenanthroline; bpe = 1, 2 -bis(4 -pyridyl) ethane; bps = 4, 4 - bipyridylsulfide] have been synthesized and characterized by X-ray single crystal structure determination, solid state electronic spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. Complex 1 is a neutral discrete cobalt(II) complex with cis located <b>selenocyanate</b> anions and forms 2 D supramolecular layers through p p interactions. Complexes 2 and 3 have a comparable structure based on metal center bridged by two bpe or bps ligands trough pyridinyl N-donor to {{give rise to}} a linear chain. The <b>selenocyanate</b> anions (SeCN) bind the metal centers through nitrogen and occupy trans axial positions of the octahedral metal coordination environment. These pendant pseudohalides located {{on both sides of the}} 1 D polymeric chain help to reinforce the packing through weak interactions. Solid state electronic spectra of all the complexes corroborate the presence of octahedral high spin cobalt(II) centers in all complexes...|$|E
40|$|Vibration ball-milling in a zirconia-lined vessel afforded {{clean and}} {{quantitative}} nucleophilic displacement reactions between 4 -methoxybenzylthiolate salts and nucleoside 5 ′-halides or 5 ′-tosylates in five to 60 minutes. Under these conditions, commonly-encountered nucleoside cyclisation byproducts (especially of purine nucleosides) were not observed. Liquid-assisted grinding {{of the same}} 5 '-iodide and 5 ′-tosylate substrates with potassium <b>selenocyanate</b> {{in the presence of}} DMF produced the corresponding 5 ′-selenocyanates in variable yields over the course of between one and eleven hours thereby avoiding the preparation and use of hygroscopic tetrabutylammonium salts...|$|E
40|$|Alkynyl selenides were {{synthesized}} by {{a straightforward}} one-pot and three-step methodology, {{without the need}} of diselenides as starting reagents, under an oxygen atmosphere and using PEG 200 as the solvent. This procedure involves the in situ generation of dialkyl diselenides through a K 3 PO 4 -assisted reaction of an alkyl <b>selenocyanate</b> obtained by a nucleophilic substitution reaction between KSeCN and alkyl halides. Successive reaction with terminal alkynes {{in the presence of}} t- BuOK affords the corresponding alkyl alkynyl selenide in moderate to good yields. Finally, this methodology allowed the synthesis of 2 -alkylselanyl-substituted benzofuran and indole derivatives starting from convenient 2 -substituted acetylenes...|$|E
