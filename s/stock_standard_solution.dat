40|$|As {{there are}} no {{certified}} reference materials, accurate, straightforward analytical procedures for the determination of americium (Am) in non-separated spent fuels employing high resolution ICP-OES and sector field (SF-) ICP-MS were developed and cross-validated. One spent (Th,Pu) O 2 fuel and two U/Pu-based spent fuels representing different chemical and isotopic compositions were analysed for their Am content. Even though the lowest limit of detection (0. 07 µg kg- 1) was obtained at 283. 226 nm, the ICP-OES signal at 408. 929 nm provided the most reliable performance {{for the analysis of}} spent fuel among the six investigated Am emission wavelengths. A massive spectral interference from Th omitted the use of the 283. 226 nm emission line for Am analysis of the (Th,Pu) O 2 fuel, while other potential interferences from plutonium (Pu) and neptunium (Np) could be excluded for all tested Am wavelengths. Employing ICP-OES, both external calibration and standard addition yielded comparable Am concentrations. Calibration of the SF-ICP-MS response for Am was accomplished using both 232 Th and 238 U signals as well as applying the related mass bias. This calibration methodology that is frequently used in absence of an Am <b>stock</b> <b>standard</b> <b>solution,</b> was tested against a home-made 241 Am <b>stock</b> <b>standard</b> <b>solution</b> underpinning the validity of this calibration approach. Sector field ICP-MS analysis essentially confirmed the Am concentrations obtained using ICP-OES in the three spent fuel solutions with mean values overlapping within their standard deviations. Considering isotopes of other actinides such as Pu and curium (Cm), the Am isotopic abundance (241 Am, 242 Am, 243 Am) was established in two non-separated fuel solutions comparing well with model calculations based on the ORIGEN- 2 code.

In this work, a rapid and reliable gas chromatographic method for determination of eight SCFAs, in colonic and faecal samples from rats and humans has been developed and validated. The methodology involves extraction of the SCFAs in water before a direct injection procedure on a FFAP capillary column. A <b>stock</b> <b>standard</b> <b>solution</b> containing acetic acid, propionic acid, n-butyric acid, i-butyric acid, n-valeric acid, i-valeric acid, n-caproic acid and n-heptanoic acid was prepared and used.

Acidification of faecal samples {{was found to be}} crucial for quantitative determination of the SCFAs, and adjustment of pH to 2 - 3 was regarded as necessary. Glass wool inserted in the glass liner of the injection port proved effective in preventing the contamination of the column by non-volatiles, and 12 % formic acid reduced the ghost peak that appeared gradually after several injections. After validation, the methodology was applied on two faecal samples from rats fed diets containing different amount of dietary fibre and one faecal sample from human fed a normal diet to test the accuracy of the developed method.
