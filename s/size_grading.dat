5000|$|It {{is worth}} noting that [...] "bed size" [...] in the UK {{generally}} refers to mattress size. This is because mattresses have a standard <b>size</b> <b>grading,</b> whereas bed frames do not. While many companies in the UK do offer bespoke bed making services, most mass-produced bed linens, bed frames and mattresses fit only the standard bed sizes above. It should be noted that a Queen size mattress in the UK is often misunderstood {{to be one of the}} larger sizes as is the case in many other parts of the world. However, at 120cm in width, it is smaller than a UK double. Another common mistake is to use a mattress size as the required space for the full dimensions of the bed and mattress.|$|E

Grading according to the sizes is an important value adding technique for most agricultural products. And also {{the price of the}} many agricultural products varies significantly according to their uniformity in size. Uniformity in size not only makes the produce more attractive to consumers but also improve its processing qualities. At present, <b>size</b> <b>grading</b> of most agricultural crops including big onion are carried out manually by crop collectors, whole sellers and retail sellers, most of farmers market their products without any grading. In Sri Lanka, persons engaging in post-harvest crop handling such as collectors, whole sellers, retail sellers, and farmers have less chance to use high technical and costly grading technique. And also local market survey reported, retail market price of the big onion bulbs are significantly varied according to its size. Hence, this research study attempted to design and development of a low cost <b>size</b> <b>grading</b> machine for <b>size</b> <b>grading</b> of big onion bulbs. <b>Size</b> <b>grading</b> machine was fabricated by cast iron and PVC tube and It was designed for grading of onion bulbs into three sizes i. e. small (φ 6 cm).

Then, the centroidal profile consists of mean of diameter, sum of diameter and maximum of diameter was extracted from the papaya object. The features fusion was perform to extract further their uniqueness, i. e. the mean-sum of diameter, mean-max of diameter and sum-max of diameter.

Methods. Urinary concentrations of urinary KIM- 1 (uKIM- 1) and urinary AQP- 1 (uAQP- 1) were determined by commercially available ELISA kits. The analysis included 40 patients undergoing partial or radical nephrectomy for cRCC and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy adult volunteers. Results. The median preoperative concentrations of KIM- 1 in the cRCC group [0. 724 ± 1. 120 ng/mg urinary creatinine (Ucr) ] were significantly greater compared with controls (healthy volunteers) (0. 210 ± 0. 082 ng/mgUcr) (p = 0. 0227).

The <b>size,</b> <b>grade</b> and stage of tumor were correlated positively with preoperative uKIM- 1 concentrations.
