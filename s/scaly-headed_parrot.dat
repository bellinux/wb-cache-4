50|$|The <b>scaly-headed</b> <b>parrot</b> (Pionus maximiliani) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Psittacidae, the true parrots. It is also called scaly-headed pionus, Maximilian pionus, Maximilian parrot, Maximilian's pionus, or Maximilian's parrot.|$|E
50|$|It is {{also the}} habitat of a varied fauna: pampas deer (locally known as veado campeiro), maned wolves (lobo guará), cougars (onça-parda or suçuarana), bush dogs (cachorro-vinagre), ocelots (jaguatirica), pacas, howler monkeys (bugio), Atlantic titis (sauá), squirrels, and {{hedgehogs}} can still be found there. Birds of note are the azure jay, the toucan, the <b>scaly-headed</b> <b>parrot</b> (maitaca), the inhambu, the jacana, the seriema and the caracara.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the frequency of occurrence and variety of intestinal parasites among free-living wild animals. Fecal samples from wild mammals and birds at rehabilitation centers in the states of Mato Grosso do Sul and S&# 227;o Paulo were analyzed by sedimentation and flotation-centrifugation methods. Parasite eggs, oocysts, cysts and/or trophozoites were found in 71 % of the samples. Cryptosporidiumsp. oocysts were detected in fecal samples from oncillas (Leopardus tigrinus) and <b>scaly-headed</b> <b>parrots</b> (Pionus maximiliani). Giardia cysts were identified in the feces of a gray brocket (Mazama gouazoubira). Among the most common parasites found, there were eggs from Toxocara cati,Toxascaris leonina and Ancylostoma tubaeforme, and from Cestoda. Several Enterobiussp. eggs were found in the feces of red howler monkeys (Alouatta seniculus). It can be concluded from this study that despite the small number of samples, the diversity of parasites found was noteworthy. Additional information about parasite endofauna in wild animals is needed, since their presence might suggest that there could be proximity to and interactions with domestic animals and/or humans. In addition, further studies on parasites from free-living wild animals are of prime importance for understanding the intensity of anthropic changes in wild environments...|$|R

O objetivo deste trabalho foi pesquisar a frequ&# 234;ncia de ocorr&# 234;ncia e a variedade de parasitas intestinais de animais silvestres de vida livre. Amostras de fezes de mam&# 237;feros e aves silvestres de centros de reabilita&# 231;&# 227;o dos Estados do Mato Grosso do Sul e S&# 227;o Paulo, foram analisadas pelos m&# 233;todos de sedimenta&# 231;&# 227;o e de centr&# 237;fugo-flutua&# 231;&# 227;o. Foram encontrados ovos, oocistos, cistos e/ou trofozo&# 237;tos de parasitas em 71 % das amostras. Oocistos de Cryptosporidium sp. foram detectados em amostras de fezes de gato-do-mato-pequeno (Leopardus tigrinus) e maritacas (Pionus maximiliani). Cistos de Giardia foram identificados nas fezes de um veado catingueiro (Mazama gouazoubira). Entre os parasitas mais comuns, foram encontrados ovos de Toxocara cati, Toxascaris leonina e Ancylostoma tubaeforme, al&# 233;m de ovos de Cestoda. V&# 225;rios ovos de Enterobius sp. foram encontrados nas fezes de bugio (Alouatta seniculus). Neste trabalho concluiu-se que, apesar de pequeno o n&# 250;mero de amostras, a diversidade de parasitas encontrados foi relevante. Informa&# 231;&# 245;es adicionais sobre a endofauna parasit&# 225;ria em animais silvestres s&# 227;o necess&# 225;rias, pois podem sugerir a intera&# 231;&# 227;o e proximidade com animais dom&# 233;sticos e/ou o homem. Al&# 233;m disso, maiores estudos sobre os parasitas de animais silvestres de vida livre s&# 227;o primordiais para a compreens&# 227;o da intensidade de altera&# 231;&# 245;es antr&# 243;picas no meio silvestre...|$|R
40|$|A {{systematic}} {{review of the}} races of the <b>Scaly-headed</b> <b>parrot</b> (Pionus maxiniliani) The author revised the geographic distribution of the four recognized races of this Parrot; a total of 187 specimens from 86 localities were examined. The confuse situation in Northem Argentina is solved, and {{the validity of the}} race lacerus is confirmed. The results diverge from those reported by Smith (1960). He restricted the race siy to NE Argentina and reported overlap with lacerus in Formosa, Chaco and Paraguay; the observations show intergradation between siy and melanoblepharus in this area. The race melanoblepharus is restricted in Argentina only to Misiones and also intergrades with siy. The geograpbic ranges of the four races of this Parrot are described...|$|E
40|$|Behavior, morphology, {{allozyme}} {{studies and}} DNA hybridization and sequencing data all suggest the independent {{evolution of the}} Old and New World parrots and support tribe status for the American species, although the phylogenetic relationships within this tribe are still poorly understood. A previous study {{has shown that the}} Yellow-faced parrot (Amazona xanthops Spix 1824) exhibits large karyotypic differences compared to the other Amazona species and suggested that this species should be renamed Salvatoria xanthops, although the relationships between S. xanthops and the other New World parrots remain unclear. In the present work, we describe the karyotype of the <b>Scaly-headed</b> <b>parrot</b> (Pionus maximiliani, Kuhl 1820) and the karyotype and C-banding pattern of the Short-tailed parrot (Graydidascalus brachyurus, Kuhl 1820) and compare them to the karyotype and C-banding pattern of S. xanthops, {{as well as to the}} karyotypes of other New World parrots. The chromosomal similarity between these three species and the karyotypic differences between them and other New World parrots suggest that G. brachyurus and S. xanthops are sister species and are most closely related to members of the genus Pionus...|$|E
