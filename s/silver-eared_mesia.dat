50|$|The <b>silver-eared</b> <b>mesia</b> (Leiothrix argentauris) is {{a species}} of bird from South East Asia.|$|E
50|$|The Free Range Aviary is home {{tropical}} forest dwelling birds such as pink pigeon, mountain peacock-pheasant, ringed teal, <b>silver-eared</b> <b>mesia,</b> scarlet-chested parrot, pheasant pigeon, Gouldian finch, sunbittern, common emerald dove, Victoria crowned pigeon, speckled mousebird, and mountain bamboo partridge. Within the aviary are some enclosed animal exhibits that {{are home to}} animals such as scarlet macaws and golden-headed lion tamarins.|$|E
50|$|The {{protected}} area is habitat {{for a wide}} diversity of faunal species. There are 315 species of butterflies, 43 species of reptile and 16 species of amphibians. 78 species of fish inhabit the many ponds, lakes and rivers. Ornithologists have recorded 440 bird species, ranging from eagles and other raptors to white-necked storks and brilliantly colored sunbirds. The 16 rare or protected bird species include the rose-ringed parakeet, Blyth's kingfisher, deep-blue kingfisher, blue-naped pitta, pale blue flycatcher, sultan tit, <b>silver-eared</b> <b>mesia,</b> spiny babbler and the white-naped yuhina.|$|E
50|$|The eggs of <b>silver-eared</b> <b>mesia</b> {{are white}} with light but rich madder-brown spots. Between two and five eggs are laid {{in a typical}} clutch, with four being the typical number in India but {{two or three more}} common in Malaysia. Both parents {{incubate}} the eggs, with (at least in captivity) the female incubating the eggs during the night. The eggs are incubated for 13 to 14 days after the laying of the first egg. Both parents feed the chicks, which fledge after 12 days, and parental care lasts for a further 22 days after fledging.|$|E
50|$|The <b>silver-eared</b> <b>mesia</b> is a {{seasonal}} breeder, with the season lasting from November to August, although the season starts later, in April, {{in the northern}} part of its range. Both the male and female are involved in building the nest, a deep cup of bamboo and other dead leaves lined with rootlets and fern fibres. The nest takes about four days to construct and is placed near ground level or up to 2m up in a bush. Underlying its relationship with the red-billed leiothrix the nest is said to be indistinguishable from the one of that species.|$|E
50|$|The diet of the <b>silver-eared</b> <b>mesia</b> is {{dominated}} by insects and their larvae, as well as fruit {{and to a lesser}} extent seeds. A study of the diet of feral birds in Hong Kong found that 87% of the faecal samples studied had the remains on insects in them, and 97% had the remains of fruit. The species will often associate in large groups of up to thirty individuals while foraging, and even forms groups during the breeding season. They will also join large flocks of other species in the forest, known as waves, which include other species of babblers. They generally feed closer to the ground, but may go as high as 5 metres up into the canopy.|$|E
50|$|The Tai Po Kau Special Area is a 'Nature Reserve' and caters {{for those}} who wish to study tree, plant, bird and insect life, as well as {{providing}} pleasant and interesting walks. There is a total ban on the lighting of fires in this important woodland area. This is Hong Kong's best site for forest birding, with species including chestnut bulbul, scarlet and grey-throated minivets, orange-bellied leafbird, fork-tailed sunbird, and scarlet-backed flowerpecker. Several species that were certainly or probably escapees from captivity have become established here - for instance, velvet-fronted nuthatch, blue-winged minla and <b>silver-eared</b> <b>mesia.</b> Migrants occur here, especially during spring and autumn, and in winter; the globally near-threatened Japanese paradise-flycatcher occurs annually in small numbers.|$|E
