5|$|A 2006 {{review of}} Asian nuthatches <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are still {{unresolved}} problems in nuthatch taxonomy and proposed splitting the genus Sitta.

5|$|Finally, Kirby also <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{was much}} scope for {{expanding}} {{the reach of}} the limitations on legislative and executive power imposed by Chapter III, and drawing on another paper by McHugh, argued that this ought to extend to the protection of due process rights as implicit constitutional rights, {{in the absence of an}} explicit bill of rights.|$|E

5|$|Analysis of {{mitochondrial}} DNA, from {{a limited}} number of specimens, <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was gene flow within the continental Asian populations until the 20th century reductions in range, and that Australia was colonized only in the Late Pleistocene, some 35,000 years ago. This has been corroborated by nDNA microsatellite analyses with four times the sample size. This study further suggests that the Australian population is quite inbred. As there exists the possibility of (limited) hybridization with the genetically distinct brolga, the Australian sarus crane can be expected to be an incipient species.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, {{in their}} 1987 sequel The Messianic Legacy, Lincoln, Baigent and Leigh <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was a current {{conflict}} between the Priory of Sion and the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, which they speculated might have originated from an earlier rivalry between the Knights Templar and Knights Hospitaller during the Crusades. However, for the dramatic structure of The Da Vinci Code, Brown chose the controversial Roman Catholic prelature Opus Dei as the Assassini-like nemesis of the Priory of Sion, {{despite the fact that}} no author had ever argued that there is a {{conflict between the}}se two groups.|$|E
5|$|In July 2006, sewage {{discharge}} from a pumping station {{resulted in the}} death of an estimated 1,400 fish, mostly juveniles. Brian Finn of the Fisheries Conservation Board <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> may have been only a small amount of sewage released but the high water temperatures and the low water levels caused by the warm weather at the time increased the fish's vulnerability to pollution. The pollution led to the temporary closure of the boating lake and part of the beach near the mouth of the river.|$|E
5|$|P. schultzi, {{along with}} a large variety of spiders and insects, is often found in the dense, large webs of the diplurid Ischnothele karschi (about 15millimetres long), which are {{especially}} abundant in partly cleared secondary bush where rain forests have been cut down, and usually about one metre above the ground. A survey of one area <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is about one P. schultzi per three I. karschi webs. P. schultzi {{is also found in}} its own web and those of other spiders, on tree trunks and the walls of buildings, and in leaf litter.|$|E

50|$|Among the Stoics, {{there was}} much {{discussion}} concerning the number of virtues {{and parts of the}} soul.

On the parts of the soul Plato divided it into two parts; Zeno into three; Panaetius into five or six; Soranus into seven; Chrysippus into as many as eight; Apollophanes into as many as nine; while other Stoics declared as many as twelve parts in the soul.|$|R
5|$|Priestley {{strongly}} <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no mind-body duality, and {{put forth}} a materialist philosophy in these works; that is, one founded {{on the principle that}} everything in the universe is made of matter that we can perceive. He also contended that discussing the soul is impossible because it is made of a divine substance, and humanity cannot perceive the divine. Despite his separation of the divine from the mortal, this position shocked and angered many of his readers, who believed that such a duality was necessary for the soul to exist.|$|E

5|$|Arriving in Iaşi (Jassy) in 1876, Goldfaden was {{fortunate}} to be better known as a good poet — many of whose poems had been set to music and had become popular songs — than as a less-than-successful businessman. Nevertheless, when he sought funds from Isaac Librescu for another newspaper, Librescu was uninterested in that proposition. Librescu's wife remarked that Yiddish-language journalism was {{just a way to}} starve; she <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> would be a lot more of a market for Yiddish-language theater. Librescu offered Goldfaden 100 francs for a public recital of his songs in the garden of Shimen Mark, Grădina Pomul Verde ("the Green Fruit-Tree Garden").|$|E

Chaired by Horace Rowan Gaither, the PSAC team completed their study in September, publishing it officially on 7 November as Deterrence & Survival in the Nuclear Age, but today known as the Gaither Report. After ascribing an expansionist policy to the USSR, along with suggestions that they were more heavily developing their military than the US, the Report <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> would be a significant gap in capability in the late 1950s due to spending levels.|$|E

His family and friends, however, held a funeral for him at the Santa Cruz funeral home in Altozano, Morelia.

5|$|One {{estimate}} {{states that}} 130,000nationals of the breakaway Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC) {{resided in the}} UK in 2008, a figure also given by the Turkish consulate in London, whereas the Museum of London reports that 100,000Turkish Cypriots live in Britain—20,000 more than in Cyprus itself. Nergis Canefe suggests a figure of 190,000, whereas the TRNC Ministry of Foreign Affairs suggested in May 2001 that 200,000 Turkish Cypriots {{were living in the}} United Kingdom.

5|$|Scholars {{have also}} argued that {{inconsistent}} application of laws in different circuits is inherently unfair. Trevor W. Morrison, for example, claims that circuit splits create potential due process conflicts if criminal defendants are unaware that their behavior constitutes criminal activity in that circuit. An article in the New England Journal on Criminal & Civil Confinement also <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{is the potential for}} the unconstitutional ex post facto application of law after circuit splits are resolved. Additionally, Jesse M. Boodoo argues that federal agencies tasked with enforcing laws throughout the United States may face challenges implementing regulatory measures when federal legislation is interpreted differently in separate circuits.|$|E
5|$|Several {{explanations}} {{have historically}} been proposed for the variation seen in the skulls of Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs. Brown and Schlaikjer <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was sexual dimorphism {{in the degree of}} doming, and hypothesized that flat-headed specimens such as AMNH5450 (Ornatotholus) represented the female morph of Stegoceras. This idea was supported by a 1981 morphometric study by Champan and colleagues, which found that males had larger and thicker domes. After other flat-headed pachycephalosaurs were discovered, the degree of doming was proposed to be a feature with taxonomic importance, and AMNH5450 was therefore considered a distinct taxon from 1979 onwards. In 1998, Goodwin and colleagues instead proposed that the inflation of the dome was an ontogenetic feature that changed with age, based on a histological study of an S. validum skull that showed the dome consisted of vascular, fast-growing bone, consistent with an increase in doming through age. These authors found that the supposedly distinct features of Ornatotholus could easily be the results of ontogeny.|$|E
5|$|The {{committee}} held oral {{hearings in}} Spring 2005 and received an unexpectedly {{large volume of}} written submissions with at least 60% being opposed to any constitutional changes to marriage or the family, including from members of Pro Life Campaign, Family Solidarity and Mother and Child Campaign. The final report, the Tenth interim report of the committee, was launched by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern on 24 January 2006. It recommended no change to the constitutional definitions, as it expected such a referendum to fail. It <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> should instead be legislation for a civil partnership registration open to same-sex or opposite-sex couples which would confer succession, maintenance and taxation rights. Controversially, it also recommended that the 'presumed' recognition of cohabiting partners by the courts, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission, should also be legislated for, but only for opposite-sex couples. The basis for the limitation {{was that it would}} be easy for the courts to determine the validity of an opposite-sex relationship if there were children.|$|E
