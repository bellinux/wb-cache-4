PCCAs are derived from gaseous microbubbles, which are able to act as targeted-contrast agents through conjugation of a ligand that is selective for an overexpressed receptor or biomarker in a given disease. Gaseous microbubbles can be condensed to liquid phase nanodroplets, which should be sufficiently small to extravasate into cells and/or tissues given their size and stability.

In this study, we report that shear stress generated by blood flow or tissue fluid flow can accelerate the proliferation, differentiation and capillary-like tube formation of EPCs. When EPCs cultured from human peripheral blood were subjected to laminar shear stress, the cells elongated and oriented their long axes in the direction of flow. The cell density of the EPCs exposed to shear stress was higher and a larger percentage of these cells were in the G 2 -M phase of the cell cycle, as compared to EPCs cultured under static conditions. Shear stress markedly increased the EPC expression of two vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, KDR and Flt- 1, and an intercellular adhesion molecule, VE-cadherin, at both the protein and mRNA levels. Assays for tube formation in the collagen gels showed that the <b>shear-stressed</b> EPCs formed tube-like structures and developed an extensive tubular network significantly faster than the static controls.

We estimated the potential for inducing seismicity by coupled thermal-hydrological-mechanical analysis of the geothermal steam production and cold water injection to calculate changes in stress (in time and space) and investigated if those changes could induce a rock mechanical failure and associated MEQs.
