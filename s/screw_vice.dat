[...] "Your friends of the {{opposition}} are evidently able to stand considerable hammering. The sum you mentioned would be no use now to pull us straight; and unless there's a break pretty soon they'll squeeze you like a <b>screw</b> <b>vice</b> on settling day. It {{would be hard to}} figure the price they'll make you pay." ...|$|E
5000|$|Charles E. Roberts {{served as}} the President and Director of the Chicago Screw Company, President and Director of the Standard <b>Screw</b> Company and <b>Vice</b> President and Director of the Pearson Machine Company. [...] Roberts invented a machine that could make the tops and bottoms of screws at the same time; he sold the {{business}} for a million dollars and devoted {{the remainder of his}} life to other inventions.|$|R
5000|$|A {{split nut}} is a nut that is split {{lengthwise}} into two pieces (opposed halves) {{so that its}} female thread may be opened and closed over the male thread of a bolt or leadscrew. This allows the nut, when open, to move along the screw without the <b>screw</b> turning (or, <b>vice</b> versa, to allow the screw {{to pass through the}} nut without turning). Then, when the nut is closed, it resumes the normal movement of a nut on a screw (in which axial travel is linked to rotational travel) ...|$|R
40|$|The crystal related arthropathies {{represent}} a heterogenous group of disorders in which minerals are deposited in musculoskeletal tissue resulting in pathological alterations. Intra articular crystals can cause acute and chronic inflammation and joint damage via biomechanical and biochemical pathways. The most common crystal related arthopathies are Gout, Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate disease (pseudogout) and calcific periarthritis / tendonitis (Basic calcium phosphate crystal deposition disease). Of these gout {{is the most}} common but easily misdiagnosed problem in day to day practice. “ <b>Screw</b> up the <b>vice</b> as tightly as possible- you have rheumatism, give it another turn and that is gout”- Anonymous The word Gout is derived from the latin word ‘gutta’ means drop. It is based on the ancient belief that th...|$|R
50|$|The Electron was {{designed}} to be very sparse, with a sizable reduction of living space that was intentionally designed to reduce wind and water resistance. They featured a high enclosed wheelhouse superstructure that Crowhurst abandoned for a flush deck that only allowed for a small rounded “doghouse” for the wheel. Aboard the ship was a table with a <b>screw</b> on <b>vice</b> for small repair work, a Marconi Kestrel radio-telephone, a small built-in table with a red cushioned seat that would have hidden the main computer but instead obscured a tangle of carefully color-coded, but unconnected, wires that hung throughout the cabin. He also had a Racal RA 6217 communications receiver, a Shannon Mar 3 transmitter/receiver, headsets, morse keys, switch panels, and gross amounts of radio spares. Powering the existing electronics on the boat was an Onan petrol-driven generator that was seated under the cockpit where it would be at risk of continuous exposure to water in rough weather, but which was again, done in line with Crowhurst’s fear of capsize. The typical “Victress” cabin also featured built in shelving and cabinetry that Crowhurst replaced with Tupperware plastic containers for storing food, electronic components, a second-hand Bell and Howell 16mm camera and Uher tape recorder that had been provided by the BBC for documenting the journey. The boat also housed a Hasler self-steering system and a Hengist-Horsa wind speed and direction indicator.|$|R
2500|$|Single block {{wire drawing}} {{machines}} include means for holding the dies accurately in position and for drawing the wire steadily through the holes. The usual design {{consists of a}} cast-iron bench or table having a bracket standing up to hold the die, and a vertical drum which rotates and by coiling the wire around its surface pulls it through the die, the coil of wire being stored upon another drum or [...] "swift" [...] which lies behind the die and reels off the wire as fast as required. The wire drum or [...] "block" [...] is provided with means for rapidly coupling or uncoupling it to its vertical shaft, so that {{the motion of the}} wire may be stopped or started instantly. The block is also tapered, so that the coil of wire may be easily slipped off upwards when finished. Before the wire can be attached to the block, a sufficient length of it must be pulled through the die; this is effected by a pair of gripping pincers {{on the end of a}} chain which is wound around a revolving drum, so drawing the wire until enough can be coiled two or three times on the block, where the end is secured by a small <b>screw</b> clamp or <b>vice.</b> When the wire is on the block, it is set in motion and the wire is drawn steadily through the die; it is very important that the block rotates evenly and that it runs true and pulls the wire at a constant velocity, otherwise [...] "snatching" [...] occurs which will weaken or even break the wire. The speeds at which wire is drawn vary greatly, according to the material and the amount of reduction.|$|R
