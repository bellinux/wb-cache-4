60|$|It needs {{scarcely}} to be told, {{with what}} feelings, {{on the eve}} of a Nantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky light of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me. Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine. But somehow I grew merry again. Delightful inducements to embark, fine chance for promotion, it seems--aye, a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet. Yes, there is death in this business of whaling--a speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity. But what then? Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death. Methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance. Methinks that in looking at things spiritual, we are too much like oysters observing the sun through the water, and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air. Methinks my body is but the lees of my better being. In fact take my body who will, take it I say, it is not me. And therefore three cheers for Nantucket; and come a stove boat and <b>stove</b> <b>body</b> when they will, for stave my soul, Jove himself cannot.|$|E
50|$|The {{choice of}} {{aluminium}} has several advantages—light weight, low cost, and good thermal conductivity to aid vaporization of fuel. Modifications {{to the surface}} such as inking or painting a dark color {{increase the amount of}} radiant thermal energy captured by the <b>stove</b> <b>body</b> and change the stove's burn profile as a function of time, fuel load, and ambient temperature. Many designs require priming to get started and most are regenerative and stable during operation. Alternative construction materials have been used, including stoves made of tin cans such as cat food tins, tuna cans, and juice cans—the basic design is very similar. Windscreens/stands can be fabricated from tin cans, cut to size with ventilation holes added. Steel beverage cans of the classic 12 ounces design are still in limited use and while they are heat resistant, their coating will burn off and they will rust if not cared for.|$|E
40|$|Cookstove {{operation}} comprises {{three basic}} processes, namely combustion of firewood, natural air draft {{due to the}} buoyancy induced by the temperature difference between the hearth and its surroundings, and heat transfer to the pot, <b>stove</b> <b>body</b> and surrounding atmosphere. Owing to the heterogenous and unsteady burning of solid fuel, there exist nonlinear and dynamic interrelationships among these process parameters. A steady-state analytical model of the cookstove operation is developed for its design improvement by splitting the hearth into three zones to study char combustion, volatile combustion and heat transfer to the pot bottom separately. It comprises a total of seven relations corresponding to a thorough analysis of the three basic processes. A novel method is proposed to model the combustion of wood to mimic the realities closely. Combustion space above the fuel bed is split into 1000 discrete parts to study the combustion of volatiles by considering a set of representative volatile gases. Model results are validated by comparing them {{with a set of}} water boiling tests carried on a traditional cookstove in the laboratory. It is found that the major thrust areas to improve the thermal performance are combustion of volatiles and the heat transfer to the pot. It is revealed that the existing design dimensions of the traditional cookstove are close to their optimal values. Addition of twisted-tape inserts in the hearth of the cookstove shows an improvement in the thermal performance due to increase in the heat transfer coefficient to the pot bottom and improved combustion of volatiles...|$|E
50|$|The {{sleeping}} platform is a raised area. Because warmer air rises and cooler air settles, the entrance area {{acts as a}} cold trap whereas the sleeping area will hold whatever heat is generated by a <b>stove,</b> lamp, <b>body</b> heat, or other device.|$|R
50|$|All {{suspension}} {{parts were}} finished in new Bowin satin finish, {{and the other}} parts were cadium plated and <b>stove</b> enamelled. The <b>body</b> was painted in a colour of the customer's choice.|$|R
40|$|Polyurethane foam {{was used}} as a {{precursor}} for fabricating SiC-based ceramic foam filters. Two recoating slurry processes were adopted to enhance the strength of ceramic foam. One was the recoating slurry of <b>stoved</b> green <b>body</b> and another was the recoating slurry of pre-sintered green body. The differences in weight increase and thermal shock resistance of ceramic foams fabricated by the two recoating slurry processes were investigated. The effects of pre-sintering temperature on weight increase and thermal shock resistance are discussed. Thermal shock resistance of ceramic foams fabricated by two recoating slurry processes is lower than that by the single coating slurry process. Compared with recoating slurry of pre-sintered green bodies, with the same slurry, the weight increase of ceramic foams fabricated by recoating slurry of the <b>stoved</b> green <b>bodies</b> is less, but the number of thermal cycles to failure is much higher. For ceramic foams fabricated by recoating slurry of pre-sintered green bodies with the same slurry, the weight increase and the number of thermal cycles to failure decreased with the pre-sintering temperature...|$|R
25|$|A parish diary exists with entries {{dating from}} the 1860s to 1968. The diary records {{reorientation}} of the seating, the 1872 addition of a <b>stove</b> in the <b>body</b> of the church, and in 1927, the partial laying of a concrete floor under the nave and chancel.|$|R
50|$|Ally's {{dead body}} is thrown {{back into the}} room and onto the <b>stove.</b> Her dead <b>body</b> burns, causing a fire, and a gas leak. Annie, Nodin, and Grandpa go into the room where the {{creature}} is outside banging on the walls. Grandpa is then killed, and Nodin begins to panic.|$|R
