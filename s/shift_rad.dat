The maximal collision-induced phase <b>shift</b> <b>rad</b> takes place when the amplitudes of the solitons are equal (1 = 2) and the length of the interaction zone is comparable with a soliton phase period. Depending on the ratio 2 1 and the collision angle between the solitons, the magnitude of the phase shift can be varied within a reasonable range, for example from 180 to 40. The analysis of the effect performed by the finite-difference beam-propagation method has shown that it is insensitive to the initial phase difference between the incident beams (), even in the case when 1 = 2. It has been demonstrated that the phenomenon can be used for all-optical three-soliton logic elements, which are capable of providing more than 3 -dB signal amplification and possess -independent output characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—During the {{experimental}} data processing, {{we find that}} corner reflectors cannot be focused properly using 3 -D SAR with a moving transmitter due to the phase reversal phenomenon based on the phase history analysis, i. e., the phases at different observation angles might <b>shift</b> <b>rad,</b> and the echoes cancel, rather than accumulate, to each other. To overcome this defect, 3 -D SAR with fixed transmitter is designed. Since the geometry of the transmitter and targets remains unchanged during the observation session, the coherence of echoes is well preserved. The mechanism of 3 -D SAR with fixed transmitter can accurately be explained using the Stratton-Chu equation. For perfect conductor, the 3 -D image {{is related to the}} electric current density. For general dielectric medium, the 3 -D image is related to the electric current density, magnetic current density and directional vector of scatterer. Experimental results show that one can focus corner reflectors and cavity-shaped objects by fixing the transmitter, which might fail for the traditional 3 -D SAR because of the phase reversal phenomenon. 1...|$|E

40|$|The pace of Late Triassic (LT) {{biodiversity}} loss is uncertain, yet {{it could}} help to decipher causal mechanisms of mass extinction. We investigated relative abundance distributions (RADs) of six LT plant assemblages from the Kap Stewart Group, East Greenland, to determine the pace of collapse of LT primary productivity. RADs displayed not simply decreases {{in the number of}} taxa, but decreases in the number of common taxa. Likelihood tests rejected a hypothesis of continuously declining diversity. Instead, the <b>RAD</b> <b>shift</b> occurred over the upper two-to-four fossil plant assemblages and most likely over the last three (final 13 meters), coinciding with increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and global warming. Thus, although the LT event did not induce mass extinction of plant families, it accompanied major and abrupt change in their ecology and diversity...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} devoted to {{analyzing}} the principle and applications of the linear electro-optic (EO) effect for {{the control of the}} carrier-envelope-phase (CEP). We introduce and detail here an original method, which relies on the use of an EO dispersive prism pair in a compressor-like configuration. We show that, by choosing an adequate geometry, it is possible to shift the CEP without changing the group delay (isochronous carrier-envelope-phase shifter) or change the induced group delay without varying the CEP. According to our calculations, when applying an electric field around 400 V/cm to the rubidium titanyle phosphate (RTP) prisms in a double pass configuration (2 × 40 mm total length), one obtains a CEP <b>shift</b> of π <b>rad</b> at 800 nm without inducing a group delay. In contrast, this CEP shift is obtained for an electric field around 1. 4 kV/cm in a RTP rectangular slab of the same total length and, in this case, the group delay is of the order of a few fs...|$|R

40|$|DNA damage {{promotes}} the activation of a signal transduction cascade {{referred to as}} the DNA damage checkpoint. This pathway initiates with the Mec 1 /ATR kinase, which then phosphorylates the Rad 53 /Chk 2 kinase. Mec 1 phosphorylation of Rad 53 is then thought to promote Rad 53 autophosphorylation, ultimately leading to a fully active Rad 53 molecule that can go on to phosphorylate substrates important for DNA damage resistance. In the absence of DNA repair, this checkpoint is eventually downregulated in a Cdc 5 -dependent process referred to as checkpoint adaptation. Recently, we showed that overexpression of Cdc 5 leads to checkpoint inactivation and loss of the strong electrophoretic <b>shift</b> associated with <b>Rad</b> 53 inactivation. Interestingly, this same overexpression did not strongly inhibit Rad 53 autophosphorylation activity as measured by the in situ assay (ISA). The ISA involves incubating the re-natured Rad 53 protein with γ 32 P labeled ATP after electrophoresis and western blotting. Using a newly identified Rad 53 target, we show that despite strong ISA activity, Rad 53 does not maintain phosphorylation of this substrate. We hypothesize that, during adaptation, Rad 53 may be in a unique state in which it maintains some Mec 1 phosphorylation but does not have the auto-phosphorylations required for full activity towards exogenous substrates...|$|R
40|$|The {{enhancement}} {{of the sound}} quality of periodic disturbances {{for a number of}} listeners within an enclosure often confronts difficulties given by cross-channel interferences, which arise from simultaneously profiling the primary sound at each error sensor. These interferences may deteriorate the original sound among each listener, which is an unacceptable result {{from the point of view}} of sound quality control. In this paper we provide experimental evidence on controlling both amplitude and relative-phase functions of stationary complex primary sounds for a number of listeners within a cavity, attaining amplifications of twice the original value, reductions on the order of 70 dB, and relative-phase <b>shifts</b> between +-pi <b>rad,</b> still in a free-of-interference control scenario. To accomplish such burdensome control targets, we have designed a multichannel active sound profiling scheme that bases its operation on exchanging time-domain control signals among the control units during uptime. Provided the real parts of the eigenvalues of persistently excited control matrices are positive, the proposed multichannel array is able to counterbalance cross-channel interferences, while attaining demanding control targets. Moreover, regularization of unstable control matrices is not seen to prevent the proposed array to provide free-of-interference amplitude and relative-phase control, but the system performance is degraded, as a function of the amount of regularization needed. The assessment of Loudness and Roughness metrics on the controlled primary sound proves that the proposed distributed control scheme noticeably outperforms current techniques, since active amplitude- and/or relative-phase-based {{enhancement of}} the auditory qualities of a primary sound no longer implies in causing interferences among different positions. In this regard, experimental results also confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme on stably enhancing the sound qualities of periodic sounds for multiple listeners within a cavity. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Resection of DNA double-strand break (DSB) ends is {{generally}} considered a critical determinant in pathways of DSB repair and genome stability. Unlike for enzymatically induced site-specific DSBs, {{little is known about}} processing of random "dirty-ended" DSBs created by DNA damaging agents such as ionizing radiation. Here we present a novel system for monitoring early events in the repair of random DSBs, based on our finding that single-strand tails generated by resection at the ends of large molecules in budding yeast decreases mobility during pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). We utilized this "PFGE-shift" to follow the fate of both ends of linear molecules generated by a single random DSB in circular chromosomes. Within 10 min after gamma-irradiation of G 2 /M arrested WT cells, there is a near-synchronous PFGE-shift of the linearized circular molecules, corresponding to resection of a few hundred bases. Resection at the radiation-induced DSBs continues so that by the time of significant repair of DSBs at 1 hr there is about 1 - 2 kb resection per DSB end. The PFGE-shift is comparable in WT and recombination-defective rad 52 and rad 51 strains but somewhat delayed in exo 1 mutants. However, in rad 50 and mre 11 null mutants the initiation and generation of resected ends at radiation-induced DSB ends is greatly reduced in G 2 /M. Thus, the Rad 50 /Mre 11 /Xrs 2 complex is responsible for rapid processing of most damaged ends into substrates that subsequently undergo recombinational repair. A similar requirement was found for RAD 50 in asynchronously growing cells. Among the few molecules exhibiting <b>shift</b> in the <b>rad</b> 50 mutant, the residual resection is consistent with resection at only one of the DSB ends. Surprisingly, within 1 hr after irradiation, double-length linear molecules are detected in the WT and rad 50, but not in rad 52, strains that are likely due to crossovers that are largely resection- and RAD 50 -independent...|$|R
