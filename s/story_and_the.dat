5|$|According to Pulitzer Prize winner Jhumpa Lahiri, Narayan's {{short stories}} {{have the same}} {{captivating}} feeling as his novels, with most of them less than ten pages long, and taking about as many minutes to read. She adds that between the title sentence and the end, Narayan provides the reader something novelists struggle to achieve in hundreds more pages: a complete insight {{to the lives of}} his characters. These characteristics and abilities led Lahiri to classify him as belonging to the pantheon of short-story geniuses that include O. Henry, Frank O'Connor and Flannery O'Connor. Lahiri also compares him to Guy de Maupassant for their ability to compress the narrative without losing the <b>story,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> common themes of middle-class life written with an unyielding and unpitying vision.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the game}} began in October 2003. The {{overview}} {{of the game}}'s story was originally drafted before the first Knights of the Old Republic was released, after which it saw many revisions and also some major redrafts. In preparation to write Knights of the Old Republic II, Chris Avellone, the game's lead designer, tried {{to learn as much}} about the Star Wars universe as possible. He read many books, guides, modules, and graphic novels, and the Obsidian team also relied on the first Knights of the Old Republic and the original Star Wars films for inspiration. Avellone said that Obsidian recognized {{one of the things that}} made Knights of the Old Republic great was the <b>story</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> companions, and that they tried to expand upon this by adding more depth to them.|$|E

5|$|Each planet {{offers a}} {{possible}} quest or {{challenge to the}} player. Challenges are tactical battles in which the player must fight against a variety of enemies. However, ships can only be harmed from behind or below; attacks from any other position will be countered by the ships' shields. Upon succeeding, a new chapter {{is added to the}} player's character's <b>story,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> player is rewarded with ship upgrades. These upgrades are used to customize ships with improvements, such as increased firing speed or heavier rear armor. The upgrades available to the player upon finishing each encounter with an enemy can vary, so the player may not receive the same upgrade by playing the same encounter in two different adventures. Flotilla has cooperative and split-screen multiplayer modes that can be played with an additional Xbox 360 controller.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of the production, Atlus staff saw Shin Megami Tensei as a chance to create a game with the company's brand on it. The staff saw it as a remake of the {{previous}} Megami Tensei game; because of this, they {{knew what was going to}} happen in the <b>story,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> development went smoothly. The story went through multiple revisions, and many settings were inspired by the staff's personal lives. The character and demon designs were done by Kazuma Kaneko, who used mythical figures and multiple clothing styles in his designs. Reception and sales for the game have been highly positive, and its success helped launch Atlus as a developer and publisher, along with popularizing the Megami Tensei series.|$|E
5|$|Ghosh, who co-wrote the <b>story</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> screenplay, {{began to}} plan the film while {{awaiting}} the release of his previous film Aladin (2009), but the dismal response to Aladin was a setback. He had to approach several producers to finance him for Kahaani, but was refused and discouraged from making the film owing to three factors: a pregnant woman as the lead star, a bunch of unknown Bengali actors as the supporting cast and Kolkata as a backdrop. Yashraj Films were willing to produce the film, but wanted Ghosh to sign a three-film deal, which he declined {{because he did not}} want that much commitment.|$|E

5|$|Remember Me was {{developed}} as the debut project of Dontnod Entertainment, {{with one of}} the company's founding members Jean-Maxime Moris as its director. Part of his goal for the game was to create a thought-provoking narrative, and eventually settled on a female protagonist to help convey the story's themes. Originally a PlayStation 3-exclusive under Sony titled Adrift, it was cancelled in 2011 and later purchased by Capcom which resurrected it as a multiplatform game. General praise was given for the world design, Olivier Deriviere's soundtrack, the ambition of the <b>story</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Memory Remix segments, while the main criticisms laid against other aspects of the story, poor design choices and formulaic combat.|$|E
5|$|Subfossils {{were also}} {{recovered}} during the 1860s, but more complete remains were found during the 1874 transit of Venus, since an observation station was {{located on the}} island. Many of these excavations were requested by brothers Alfred and Edward Newton, who used them to describe the osteology of the bird in detail. Thousands of bones were excavated, and mounted skeletons were composed from the remains of several specimens. It {{has been suggested that}} the skeleton of this species is the best described after that of humans. In spite of this, some later scholars doubted Leguat's <b>story,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> existence of the Rodrigues solitaire. In 1955, George Evelyn Hutchinson doubted aspects of the bird's biology mentioned by Leguat, and in 1921, G. Atkinson claimed the memoir was merely a novel, and that the man had never even existed. Today, it is widely accepted that Leguat's memoirs are credible observations of the bird in life.|$|E
