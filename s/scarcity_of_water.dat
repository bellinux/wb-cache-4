5|$|Emus drink infrequently, but ingest {{large amounts}} when the {{opportunity}} arises. They typically drink once a day, first inspecting the water body and surrounding area in groups before kneeling down at the edge to drink. They prefer being on firm ground while drinking, rather than on rocks or mud, but if they sense danger, they often stand rather than kneel. If not disturbed, they may drink continuously for ten minutes. Due to the <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> sources, emus are sometimes forced to go without water for several days. In the wild, they often share water holes with kangaroos, other birds and animals; they are wary and tend {{to wait for the}} other animals to leave before they quench their thirst.|$|E
5|$|Due to <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> the Namib Desert Horse {{sometimes}} {{goes without}} water {{for as long}} as thirty hours in summer and has been known to go close to 72 hours without water during the winter, significantly longer than most horses, even other feral herds. A 1991 study suggested that in 75 years of genetic isolation and water scarcity the population had developed physiological mechanisms which improved their ability to conserve water. In 1993, a second study showed that the physiological water-conservation ability did not differ between Namib Desert Horses and other populations when dehydrated for periods of up to 60 hours, but suggested that the Namib Desert Horse would show improved conservation ability when dehydration periods were extended to upwards of 72 hours, a common occurrence in their feral state.|$|E
5|$|The Iago sparrow is gregarious while {{foraging}} and breeding. Outside of {{the breeding}} season, Iago sparrows {{are always in}} flocks, which may be of considerable size. It flocks with other birds, even warblers such as the blackcap and the Cape Verde warbler. The Iago sparrow is not very shy toward humans, allowing them to approach, even while it is at its nest. Birds on the isolated and uninhabited island of Raso will even perch on human visitors with little fear. Because of the <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> to drink in its habitat, it has a strong attraction to sources of water, and large flocks may congregate when humans provide water it can drink. It often is seen dust bathing in small groups, a behavior necessary to keep clean with a paucity of water.|$|E

25|$|In 1912, {{when the}} town's {{population}} was approximately 5,000 people, the city's civic leaders designed and enacted a sophisticated city plan that incorporated elements of contemporary movements for the City Beautiful movement, city planning, and historic preservation; the latter particularly influenced by similar movements in Germany. The plan anticipated limited future growth, considered the <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> and recognized the future prospects of suburban {{development on the}} outskirts.

25|$|Regardless {{the type}} of patrol, a night march would {{normally}} {{be made to the}} area. Conditions could make this task most difficult, especially when it was so dark that the troopies were completely blind. <b>Scarcity</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> could present an issue to the patrol. The civilians were not regarded as hostiles by the troops. There were numerous occasions when they helped each other and process of great empathy took place. If a patrol learned of enemy presence the patrol force immediately moved to engage the enemy. On occasions the patrols were ambushed. Patrols in Mozambique were considered the most hazardous, due to the violent reaction of FRELIMO (also known as FPML).|$|E
25|$|Rajasthani cooking was {{influenced}} by both the war-like lifestyles of its inhabitants {{and the availability of}} ingredients in this arid region. Food that could last for several days and could be eaten without heating was preferred. The <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and fresh green vegetables have all had their effect on the cooking.

500|$|Finds in [...] "Tomb IV" [...] {{indicate}} that Qatna {{was engaged in}} long distance trade since its early history. The city's location {{on the edges of}} the Syrian steppes turned it into a strategic stop for caravans traveling to the Mediterranean Sea from the east. The countryside surrounding the city provided the key for its success in the Early Bronze Age IV; those lands were capable of supporting both agriculture and pastoralism. Despite the modern <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> geoarchaeological research on the wadis of the region confirm the abundance of water during the Bronze Age. The land was abundant in pasture lands; when drought struck Mari, Išḫi-Addu allowed its nomads to graze their flocks in Qatna.|$|E

When Louise offered to continue the ironing, the woman refused, adding that she was in a great hurry to finish so that she could go and see Princess Louise. Realising that she had not been recognised, Louise enquired whether McCarthy would recognise her again.

500|$|According to Rose, Savedra {{knew that}} the Mohave rarely ventured this far from their homelands, so they assumed the Hualapai had taken the animals, which were {{returned}} the following morning as the party camped at Peach Springs. The animals were led back by twenty-five Natives hoping for compensation in return, as Udell explained: [...] "It was soon evident that they expected very extravagant rewards, all expecting shoes, clothing, and trinkets, besides some cattle... many remained in camp with us that night, doubtless {{for the purpose of}} stealing, but the guard kept so sharp a lookout that they found no opportunity." [...] On August 20, the party awoke to another fifty Hualapai anticipating gifts in exchange for the return of the stolen animals. The Natives left around noon, after receiving tobacco, trinkets, and food, but the emigrants noticed that six oxen were missing. A search team located four carcasses that had been stripped of their flesh; the other two animals were found nearby, having been recently killed, but not yet butchered. That night, the Rose–Baley Party decided to once again split their wagon train in response to the <b>scarcity</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> According to Baley, as they journeyed from their campsite at Peach Springs to the Colorado River more than [...] away, they were almost continuously harassed by Natives, who sent arrows flying into their wagon train during the day and raided their camp at night.|$|E
