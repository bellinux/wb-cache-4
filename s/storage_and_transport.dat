5|$|Carbohydrates are {{aldehydes}} or ketones, {{with many}} hydroxyl groups attached, that can exist as straight chains or rings. Carbohydrates {{are the most}} abundant biological molecules, and fill numerous roles, such as the <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> of energy (starch, glycogen) and structural components (cellulose in plants, chitin in animals). The basic carbohydrate units are called monosaccharides and include galactose, fructose, and most importantly glucose. Monosaccharides can be linked together to form polysaccharides in almost limitless ways.|$|E

Highly perishable fruits like cherry, apricot, peaches and plums have a huge demand but are unable to tap the market fully because of lack of cold <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> infrastructure.

25|$|There {{are many}} {{technological}} methane production methods. Methane created from biomass in industrial plants via biological route is called biogas. A more synthetic method to produce methane is hydrogenating carbon dioxide through the Sabatier process. Methane {{is also a}} side product of the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide in the Fischer–Tropsch process, which is practiced {{on a large scale}} to produce longer-chain molecules than methane. Example of large-scale coal-to-methane gasification is the Great Plains Synfuels plant, started in 1984 in Beulah, North Dakota as a way to develop abundant local resources of low-grade lignite, a resource that is otherwise very hard to transport for its weight, ash content, low calorific value and propensity to spontaneous combustion during <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{key issue}} in {{implementing}} IGCC is its high capital cost, which prevents it from competing with other power plant technologies. Currently, ordinary pulverized coal plants are the lowest cost power plant option. The advantage of IGCC {{comes from the}} ease of retrofitting existing power plants that could offset the high capital cost. In a 2007 model, IGCC with CCS is the lowest-cost system in all cases. This model compared estimations of levelized cost of electricity, showing IGCC with CCS to cost 71.9 $US2005/MWh, pulverized coal with CCS to cost 88 $US2005/MWh, and natural gas combined cycle with CCS to cost 80.6 $US2005/MWh.

25|$|Plain sigillata table vessels, which {{included}} large platters, shallow dishes in several sizes, slightly deeper bowls, and small cups, {{were made on}} the wheel using a range of templates to create very precise profiles.

25|$|As {{early as}} July 1951 the Victorian Minister for Transport {{announced}} that the remaining 28 X class locomotives were to be converted to PBC operation. Victorian Railways went on to convert express passenger locomotive R707 to PBC operation and {{went as far as}} placing tenders {{for the construction of a}} further 15 new brown-coal fired X class locomotives. However, by 1957 the price of PBC had doubled against a fall in the price of fuel oil and the increased availability of high quality NSW coal at good prices. This, coupled with the demonstrated efficiency and economical operation of B class mainline diesel-electric locomotives introduced in 1952, made the high cost of installing <b>storage</b> <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> facilities for PBC uneconomic. The additional X class order had already been cancelled in favour of additional B class locomotives, and in January 1957 Victorian Railways announced the discontinuation of PBC operation and the intention to return X32 and R707 to black coal firing. X32, taken out of service in May 1956 pending repairs, was instead scrapped in August 1957.|$|E

For example, dozens of different types of British coarse and fine wares were produced locally, yet many other classes of pottery were also imported from elsewhere in the Empire.
