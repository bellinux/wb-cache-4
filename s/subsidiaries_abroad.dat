This paper presents the empirical results of a quantitative survey of 316 subsidiaries, international joint ventures and wholly foreign owned enterprises, set up in China by European and Japanese multinationals. The main objective of the survey is to bring out an inductive multidimensional model of control, and to allow a better understanding of complex interaction and balance between the instruments of control of a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>abroad.</b> Joint ventures Control Subsidiaries Multinationals China...|$|R

From this position of strength, it was also (probably) the first Finnish company to open a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>abroad,</b> in the Swedish town of Härnösand in 1903. The severe competition between the Finnish tobacco producers (such as P.C. Rettig & Co and Tollander & Klaerich) led to rapid technological development in the branch. By the 1840s, Strengberg had started to install machinery and industrialise artisan production.

50|$|Capital {{movements}} {{offset the}} surpluses or deficits {{in the current}} account. A current account surplus, for example, implies that rather than using all the foreign currency earned by selling exports to buy imports, corporations and individuals choose to invest the money in foreign-currency-denominated assets instead. As measured in Japan's balance of payments data, capital movements consist of long- and short-term investments and movements in official foreign exchange reserves and private bank accounts. Capital movements include loans, portfolio investments in corporate stock, and direct investment (establishment or purchase of <b>subsidiaries</b> <b>abroad).</b> A capital outflow occurs when a Japanese individual or corporation makes a loan, buys foreign stock, or establishes a subsidiary abroad. A capital inflow occurs when foreigners engage in these operations in Japan.|$|E

40|$|International labour {{mobility}} {{is becoming a}} key feature of a globalizing world. There is an increasing amount of literature on the success and failure conditions of migrant workers. A particular class of foreign workers is formed by so-called expatriates who are sent on a temporary basis (several years normally) by a parent company located in a given country {{to live and work}} in another country, notably as an employee in a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>abroad.</b> This paper aims to investigate the performance of expatriate managers by explaining their cross-cultural adjustment potential from their personal management style features. These features are derived from the concept of locus of control in social learning theory, in which two types of responses to challenges are distinguished: internals (controlling events themselves) and externals (following outside forces). Based on a sample of 43 individuals, our study concludes that managers with an internal locus of control are more successful in coping with the difficulties inherent in adjusting to a foreign culture. ...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} reason that affects a banks decision to entry a foreign market is to “follow the customer” also called the defensive hypothesis. Foreign banks building upon the expertise in their home country they can differentiate themselves from their competitors in the host country by offering complex and specialized services to their home country corporate customers. Years of long-lasting relationship have provided the banks with crucial information about the unique financial needs that their clients have, the knowledge of which is unavailable to host country institutions. In addition, through this relationship banks are able to develop a competitive advantage stemming through the lower marginal costs that those banks experience when dealing with loan renewals over their local competitors. Unlike manufacturing where knowledge can be protected through patterns and other means, commercial intelligence can be easily gained by any bank with an interest in starting its operations in specific market or industries. In addition, letting other financial institutions to develop a relationship with its existing corporate clients can result in the loss of market share in the banks home county. In order to prevent this from happening banks are obliged to follow the client by opening an office (branch, <b>subsidiary)</b> <b>abroad</b> themselves in order to defend their unique bank client relationship.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States {{taxation}} can {{be imposed}} as a statutory {{corporate income tax}} {{as well as a}} taxation on the profits that domestic corporations collect from their <b>subsidiaries</b> <b>abroad.</b> This policy of taxing foreign profits is called a [...] "worldwide" [...] system of taxation, and it contrasts with the [...] "territorial" [...] system employed by most developed countries including the United Kingdom and Canada, which generally tax only profits from domestic activities. The result is that U.S. corporations with subsidiaries in lower-tax jurisdictions face higher taxes on those foreign operations than they would if they were incorporated elsewhere. As Bloomberg View columnist Matt Levine wrote in 2014: If we're incorporated in the U.S., we'll pay 35 percent taxes on our income in the U.S. and Canada and Mexico and Ireland and Bermuda and the Cayman Islands, but if we're incorporated in Canada, we'll pay 35 percent on our income in the U.S. but 15 percent in Canada and 30 percent in Mexico and 12.5 percent in Ireland and zero percent in Bermuda and zero percent in the Cayman Islands.|$|E

30|$|Second, the host-country {{approach}} {{proposes that}} a firm adapts {{to the local}} environment, implying that the headquarters’ influence on <b>subsidiaries</b> <b>abroad</b> is limited, or that subsidiaries are sufficiently autonomous {{to make their own}} decisions, so that no differences between internationalized and domestic firms remain.

40|$|The {{transfer}} of vocational {{education and training}} (VET) systems is currently the subject of lively international debate, but there {{has so far been}} very little documentation of the process or analysis of how such transfers are achieved in practical terms. This paper therefore considers the potential for transferring Germany s dual vocational training system to German <b>subsidiaries</b> <b>abroad,</b> specifically in China, India, Japan and the USA. Using the EPRG typology as a theoretical framework, the paper systematises the range of training strategies deployed by German subsidiaries. It analyses the findings of interviews with training officers and Directors of Human Resources in more than 40 German <b>subsidiaries</b> <b>abroad.</b> These interviews show clearly that local factors in the host country exert such a strong influence that it is not possible completely to transfer the German VET system to another country. What is more likely is that an accommodation is reached with local VET structures, local labour market conditions and other socio-cultural features. The findings suggest that policy borrowing in the area of VET is likely to be only partial and will be strongly influenced by the national characteristics of the host country...|$|E

40|$|Background: Family Businesses {{represent}} the highest proportion of {{businesses in the}} world (Lin, 2012). Globalisation offers new business opportunities for growth and in-ternational diversification. Generally the internationalisation of family businesses is a well-studied field in family business research (Kontinen & Ojala, 2009). Still, there are certain shortcomings {{when it comes to}} the specific area of corporate governance adapta-tion in family firms that open subsidiaries (Calabro & Mussolino, 2011). Hence, this paper analyses the proceedings of family firms that internationalise through a subsidi-ary. From a methodological standpoint, existing studies concerned with family business internationalisation focus on quantitative research approaches. The results of these in-clude some limitations, since they cannot account for questions such as how and why family firms proceed during diversification (Kontinen & Ojala, 2009). Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the rationale behind corporate gov-ernance structures in family businesses, focusing on the special case of internationalisa-tion through a subsidiary. Frame of Reference: A summary of recent research regarding the three main issues family businesses, internationalisation, and corporate governance will be given in the frame of reference. This theoretical background will serve as the basis for a solid analy-sis of our empirical data. Method: A qualitative approach with an extensive literature review and a case study based on in-depth interviews with employees of the company Väderstad-Verken AB was chosen in order to fulfil the purpose. Conclusion: The rationale behind corporate governance structures when setting up a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>abroad</b> is driven by the ambition to preserve a family firms’ stewardship ori-ented culture and its informal structures. The result of this is better collaboration, which serves the mission of the business...|$|R
40|$|People make {{up one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} resources for a corporation and therefore it has to continuously seek an ever more diverse and international workforce. Inpatriation is another way of utilizing foreign expertise in a corporation. An inpatriate refers to a person that is on an international assignment at the headquarters of a corporation, where they have been sent either from a <b>subsidiary</b> <b>abroad</b> or from a third country outside the corporation. Strengthening the social network of the inpatriate and their family contributes to the adjustment process and furthermore the success of the work assignment. As social networking sites are currently the fastest developing personal networking tools in the world, it is interesting to see how they can help in inpatriate adjustment. The objective of this thesis is to explore the potential of social networking sites (SNS) in inpatriate adjustment. The main objective can be divided into three sub objectives: 1. What is SNS used for during the inpatriate assignment? 2. What are the inpatriates’ motivations to use SNS? 3. Could the three facets of adjustment (work, interaction and general) be gained through SNS? This qualitative study utilizes the theme interview data collection method and the thematic analysis approach for analysing the interview data. From the interviews with five Indian inpatriates in Finland the most mentioned uses of SNS were related to participating (sharing opinions, recommendations and discussing things and connecting to friends, family and colleagues) and consuming (collecting information for work and free time), the least mentioned use of SNS was producing (posting videos, photos and updates). An interesting finding was that the five interviewees did not use SNS for purely entertainment motives at all during their assignment. This thesis found that all three facets of adjustment could potentially be gained through SNS...|$|R
40|$|Whilst {{theories}} of business internationalisation assert that foreignness poses challenges to multinational companies’ <b>subsidiaries</b> operating <b>abroad,</b> historical study of Hilton International’s {{expansion in the}} 1960 s suggests otherwise. In its early internationalisation Hilton International transferred abroad its institutional ownership advantages including corporate philosophy and culture; its practices, policies, processes and work systems and product design.

Analysis of Hilton’s expansion strategy suggests that the company used its foreignness as a differentiating factor.
