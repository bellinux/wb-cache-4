500|$|Gass has {{described}} Tenacious D's comic assertion {{that they are}} the best band as being [...] "ridiculous because it's a matter of opinion". Black characterizes Tenacious D's comic nature as an antidote to [...] "the masculinity of rock", adding [...] "There's also <b>something</b> <b>funny</b> about the macho-ness of rock. Like the bands that are the fucking hardest rocking are like, 'We'll fucking kick your ass, dude... with our rock.'" [...] Russell Brand, All Shall Perish, The Lonely Island, and Kanye West have in turn been influenced by the work of Tenacious D.|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said he {{was enjoying}} the new paper company storyline, but that [...] "Michael Scott Paper Company" [...] was not as funny as [...] "Dream Team", which aired the same day. Sepinwall praised {{particular}} scenes such as Dwight and Andy's competitive duet [...] and Kelly's plan to make Charles want her. She criticized the cramped new office space jokes as being less funny than those in previous episodes. Sepinwall also said the storyline between Jim and Charles was getting repetitive and, [...] "It would help if the writers ever gave Idris Elba <b>something</b> <b>funny</b> to do." [...] Margaret Lions of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "This episode wasn't {{one of my favorites}} … No bombs, no bits that failed, and by The Offices standards, nothing even particularly cringe worthy. But 'TMSPC' is more groundwork than payoff." [...] She said Dwight's rendition of [...] "Take Me Home, Country Roads" [...] in German was [...] "the absolute funniest moment of the episode".|$|E

60|$|We {{all felt}} we could believe that assertion. If he had boasted {{that he could}} tell a duller, more uninteresting story, we should have doubted him; but the {{possibility}} of his being able to relate <b>something</b> <b>funnier,</b> we could readily grasp.|$|R
500|$|... "Dream Team" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger said he {{was enjoying}} the new paper company storyline and that [...] "Dream Team" [...] was funnier than [...] "Michael Scott Paper Company". Sepinwall said the final scene with Michael trying to comfort Pam in the car was a [...] "good payoff" [...] which was well acted by Steve Carell and Jenna Fischer, and [...] "yet another reminder that Michael does know what he's doing some of the time, which means Pam wasn't a complete idiot for following him out the door." [...] He also liked Kevin's struggle with the phones in the beginning, but said the storyline between Jim and Charles was getting repetitive and, [...] "It would help if the writers ever gave Idris Elba <b>something</b> <b>funny</b> to do." [...] Steven Mullen of The Tuscaloosa News called the episode [...] "stellar", said the Charles Miner soccer subplot ended [...] "perfectly" [...] and said, [...] "Watching [...] fears bubble beneath the surface and slowly erode Pam's confidence was a masterwork." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Black & Blue" [...] {{received}} {{a positive response}} from music critics. John Bergstrom of PopMatters described it as [...] "smooth, winning blue-eyed soul", and Neil Ashman of Drowned in Sound commented that its breathy vocals, piano chords and synth backing made it a [...] "successful blend of melancholy and dancefloor-ready rhythms". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian deemed the falsetto vocals and synths [...] "naggingly infectious", citing it as the band's strong point: [...] "the trio may be faceless, but they write a good tune". Sputnikmusic's staff reviewer Rudy Klapper felt that the [...] "techno swirl" [...] of the song [...] "nail the juxtaposition between Wyatt's moody lyrics and the irrepressible production". Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music rated [...] "Black & Blue" [...] four stars out of five and recommended it for when [...] "you just need something to lift the spirits a bit, without someone shouting something stupid in your ear". He continued, [...] "It basically wants to rub your shoulders {{at the end of}} a long hard day, and whisper <b>something</b> <b>funny</b> in your ear while your shoulders untie." [...] Natalie Kaye of Contactmusic.com said that although it begins melancholy, it [...] "swells to become one of the noisiest points on Miike Snow". Paul Mitchell of The Skinny felt that Wyatt channels Paddy McAloon's breathy vocal style on [...] "Black & Blue", but without the [...] "lyrical wit". He rated the song three stars out of five and called it [...] "decent", finding the remixes available on the release more interesting. A more critical review came from Pitchfork Media's Marc Hogan, who wrote that it [...] "promisingly... splits the difference between Prince and piano-pop, only to underwhelm as a whole".|$|E
2500|$|... "Underdog, {{put that}} on a T-Shirt!" [...] O'Neal's common catchphrase towards Senior Researcher/Producer Joe [...] "Underdog" [...] Underhill. Whenever a snide or humorous remark is made by the crew or if a humorous image is shown, this quote is {{constantly}} used by O'Neal or stated {{in a different way}} at times to fit the context (ex. [...] "Underdog, {{put that on}} a Valentine's Day card!" [...] if <b>something</b> <b>funny</b> is said during or near Valentine's Day). It has even been made as an actual T-shirt.|$|E

60|$|He {{looked up}} quickly. In {{addition}} to the far-away look, Attell's face now wore a faint smile, {{as if he had}} seen <b>something</b> rather <b>funny</b> on the horizon. But he spake no word.|$|R
2500|$|Roberts, a self-confessed fan of Christie's works, {{made the}} episode into a comedy. [...] Roberts based the episode on his {{favourite}} Christie works: Crooked House, {{which focuses on}} secrets within an aristocratic society, and the 1982 film adaptation of Evil Under the Sun. Speaking of both works, Roberts noted that it was [...] "quite strange writing a modern Doctor Who with posh people in it. We don't really see posh people on television anymore, except at Christmas", and [...] "there's <b>something</b> <b>funny</b> about the veneer of upper class respectability and the truth of any family underneath". He also stated that [...] "there's really nothing nicer than watching a lot of English actors hamming {{it up in a}} vaguely exotic location... and then somebody's murdered!" [...] The episode's title was deliberately chosen to sound [...] "vaguely Christie-ish", but Roberts admitted that [...] " [...] never used 'the blank and the blank' construction".|$|E
2500|$|The {{suspended}} Sierra then {{contacted the}} American Civil Liberties Union, {{who agreed to}} take up her cause. The issue was considered settled after a meeting between Sierra, the ACLU, Sierra's mother and Mann, until {{a meeting of the}} school's board of education on October 29, the day of Sierra's return to school. The meeting discussed the events of the previous week, and some board members were initially sympathetic to Sierra. However, comments turned hostile {{towards the end of the}} meeting, with Sierra being told [...] "his isn't <b>something</b> <b>funny</b> or cute…ou're talking about overthrowing the government", and having her actions characterized as [...] "like you stood up and waved a Japanese flag on Pearl Harbor day". In reference to Sierra, president of the board Bill Raglin asked [...] "hat the hell is wrong with a kid like that?" [...] and board member John Luoni accused Sierra of committing treason. Sierra fled the meeting in tears. The following day, The Charleston Gazette published comments by Mann to the effect that the messages on Sierra's T-shirts included [...] "I hope Afghanistan wins" [...] and [...] "America should burn."; Mann later claimed he had been misquoted, and that he had taken his information from Jacob Reed. Students spat on Sierra's mother's car at Sissonville High, and her friends' parents wouldn't give her rides home from school. Threats, taunting, jeering by her fellow students escalated into physical assaults, and Sierra's mother pulled her out of school; the threats would ultimately cause Sierra to move out of the town. Sierra voiced her belief that people at Sissonville High were permitted to talk about how they felt about certain things, so long as there were others who agreed with them. She denied being anti-American, and that anarchism implies support for terrorism, countering that it is an anti-authoritarian and non-violent philosophy.|$|E
6000|$|... "Only an anti-snoring {{machine and}} an elbow-pad," [...] {{answered}} Ralph, with {{a twinkle in}} his eye, as if reminded of <b>something</b> <b>funny.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "You ass," [...] said Lambert; [...] "why can't you be {{like other}} people? Why can't you say <b>something</b> really <b>funny,</b> or hold your tongue? The man {{who sits on}} his hat in a {{pantomime}} is a long sight funnier than you are." ...|$|R
50|$|Working from Chandler's {{original}} {{words and}} adding spins of their own, the writers (William Faulkner, Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett) wrote {{one of the}} most quotable of screenplays: it's unusual to find yourself laughing in a movie not because <b>something</b> is <b>funny</b> but because it's so wickedly clever.|$|R
6000|$|... "'I've had it mended since then,' and I {{laughed as}} if believing {{he had said}} <b>something</b> terribly <b>funny,</b> for, even if I'm not the bravest animal in the world, I wouldn't let a mangy old fox think I was afraid of him, no matter how scared I might be.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Rather. I wish I could {{remember}} <b>something</b> <b>funny</b> {{to tell you}} though. There are lots of jokes, but I am such a one for forgetting them.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all the same. I knowed {{they was}} <b>something</b> <b>funny</b> about 'em. Had the allwise steer to the yellow. That Laura Sibley was goin' to take 'em {{right to the}} spot where they'd all be millionaires." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{got to get}} at it {{some other}} way," [...] said Jimmy, [...] "but you bet your life I'm going to get at it. It looks to me as though there's <b>something</b> <b>funny</b> about that pay-roll." ...|$|E
5000|$|She {{appeared}} as Desiree {{in the independent}} film Wristcutters: A Love Story opposite Patrick Fugit, Shannyn Sossamon, Tom Waits, and Will Arnett. Wristcutters revolved around two characters who fall in love in purgatory after committing suicide. It was shown at both The Sundance Film Festival and The Seattle International Film Festival Awards in 2006. It was nominated for several awards including Sundance's Grand Jury Prize, two Independent Spirit Awards, the Humanitas Prize. The film was well received by several critics. That year, she played as Will Ferrell's wife Carley in the comedy feature film Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. Recalling acting with Ferrell during an interview with TV Guide, she said he was [...] "just funny. And he has no qualms about making <b>something</b> <b>funnier</b> for you, even at his expense." ...|$|R
60|$|There was <b>something</b> irresistibly <b>funny</b> in {{the calm}} stateliness of the blond Parker {{as he led}} the way past the store which was deserted of its patrons, past the school-house where the {{students}} were quivering with excitement, and close beside the office behind whose doors Curtis was still in legal battle with the sheriff.|$|R
5000|$|Driving for Candies and Hughes, in 1984 Oswald did <b>something</b> no <b>Funny</b> Car {{driver had}} done before: he won both the NHRA and IHRA world championships. [...] The team took four IHRA titles between 1983 and 1987, {{including}} {{two in a}} row, 1986 and 1987, as well as beating John Force in the 1986 Big Bud Shootout (losing to him the next year).|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} had that advantage," [...] replied Sam stiffly. [...] "But anyone can sing a drawing-room ballad. Now <b>{{something}}</b> <b>funny,</b> something that will make people laugh, something that really needs putting across ... that's a different thing altogether." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Here {{is another}} of our good friends for you to know. He’s our {{neighbor}} at the north and is considered the most enterprising orange grower in all California,” announced Weldon, with a chuckle that indicated he had said <b>something</b> <b>funny.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "Maybe you're right." [...] She brightened. [...] "Listen! Great idea! Mr. Foster {{can write}} in a line for Elsa, calling me down, and another giving me a good come-back, and then another for Elsa saying {{something}} else, and then <b>something</b> really <b>funny</b> for me, and so on. We can work it up into a big comic scene. Five or six minutes, all laughs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{mean to say}}," [...] said Turnbull, [...] "and I mean to say <b>something</b> <b>funnier</b> still. I have learnt {{everything}} I {{wanted to}} know from the partially black musician over there, who has taken a run in his war-paint to meet a friend in a quiet pub along the coast--the noble savage has {{told me all about}} it. The bottle containing our declaration, doctrines, and dying sentiments was washed up on Margate beach yesterday in the presence of one alderman, two bathing-machine men, three policemen, seven doctors, and a hundred and thirteen London clerks on a holiday, to all of whom, whether directly or indirectly, our composition gave enormous literary pleasure. Buck up, old man, this story of ours is a switchback. I have begun to understand the pulse and the time of it; now we are up in a cathedral and then we are down in a theatre, where they only play farces. Come, I am quite reconciled--let us enjoy the farce." ...|$|R
5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{praised the}} film, giving it {{three out of}} four stars and saying, [...] "as comedies go, this is a very funny one." [...] He elaborated, concluding, [...] "Maybe the movie has too much coherence, and the plot is too predictable; that's a {{weakness}} of films based on well-made Broadway plays. Still, that's hardly a serious complaint about <b>something</b> as <b>funny</b> as Play It Again, Sam." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{contrast}} {{struck me}} {{all at once}} as we stood in the lighted verandah, after rising from the dinner-table. I was fascinated by {{it for the rest}} of the evening, and I remember the impression of <b>something</b> <b>funny</b> and ill-omened at the same time in it to this day.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lucky for you I am, for if I put on crushed airs {{and tried}} to be dismal, as you do, we {{should be in a}} nice state. Thank goodness, I can always find <b>something</b> <b>funny</b> to keep me up. Don't croak any more, but come home jolly, there's a dear." ...|$|E
6000|$|The elderly sailor {{displayed}} a profound indifference towards human emotions. However, after a longish pause he conceded {{a few words}} more to the second officer's weakness. [...] "Yes. He was walking the deck as usual when suddenly he laughed a little and made for the companion. Thought of <b>something</b> <b>funny</b> all at once." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{the stillness}} the sally was {{heard over the}} whole house, and the audience, {{relieved}} of its anxiety for its favorite, laughed with an uproariousness that had in it the note of hysteria. Even Genevieve {{felt that there was}} <b>something</b> irresistibly <b>funny</b> in the remark, and the relief of the audience was communicated to her; yet she felt sick and faint, and was overwrought with horror at what she had seen and was seeing.|$|R
6000|$|... "She used to {{play the}} piano. So did I, once. But I never let her know after I'd heard her play the first time. And she thought her playing was wonderful, the dear, fond girl! You know the sort, the {{mechanical}} one-two-three tum-tum-tum school-girl stuff. And now I'll tell you <b>something</b> <b>funnier.</b> Her playing WAS wonderful to me. The gates of heaven opened to me when she played. I can see myself now, worn out and dog-tired after the long day, lying on the mats of the palace veranda and gazing upon her at the piano, myself in a perfect idiocy of bliss. Why, this idea she had of her fine playing was the one flaw in her deliciousness of perfection, and I loved her for it. It kind of brought her within my human reach. Why, when she played her one-two-three, tum-tum-tum, I was in the seventh heaven of bliss. My weariness fell from me. I loved her, and my love for her was clean as flame, clean as my love for God. And do you know, into my fond lover's fancy continually intruded the thought that God in most ways must look like her.|$|R
500|$|... "You May Now Kiss the... Uh... Guy Who Receives" [...] had {{an average}} of 7.8 million viewers and was the eighty-first most watched show of the week. Bob Sassone from TV Squad wrote that he could not stop {{laughing}} throughout the episode, feeling that there is [...] "just <b>something</b> really <b>funny</b> about gay dogs getting married and a giant gold statue of Dig 'Em, the Sugar Smacks mascot". While reviewing the Family Guy: Volume 4 [...] DVD, Nancy Basile of About.com called the episode [...] "sharp".|$|R
