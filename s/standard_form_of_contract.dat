The aim of this research is to ascertain whether there is a relationship between readability of contract clauses and their interpretation. Readability is concerned with the complexity of words and sentences of text and it is commonly assessed by readability formulas. The survey undertaken for this research measured the ability of construction contract clauses having different readability values to convey a common understanding to all categories of respondents in terms {{of the degree to which}} risk was apportioned between the client and the contractor. The study reveals that there is a relationship between readability and contract interpretation.

Despite the fact that industry can only function {{on the basis of}} payment by the employers, over the years the employers had relied on the contention to set-off {{and use it as a}} basis for their refusal to pay the contractors as the amount due as shown in the payment certificates. In Malaysia, CIDB 2000, PAM 2006 and PWD Form 203 (A) <b>Standard</b> <b>Form</b> <b>of</b> <b>Contract</b> are widely used to govern construction projects and manage contractual relationship between contractors and the employers.

However, payment problems {{have been on the}} increase since last four decades. The research therefore evaluated the effectiveness of those payment provisions. Construction practitioners surveyed were of the opinion that overall the provisions in the <b>standard</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> and the CCA are moderately effective.

This distribution of effectiveness is supported by the views which include: the CCA improves payment problems as it resolves disputes faster; the CCA is incapable of guaranteeing payment; failure to comply with the CCA provisions and reluctance to apply the provisions on certain reputed project partners. The research therefore recommends {{that there needs to be}} changes to the CCA to have a separate mean(s) of securing payment in the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> escrow account, payment bond or any other means.

In the government sector as well as private construction, the project managers are either civil engineers, quantity surveyors or architects. Due to role of architects in construction, their responsibility and ability would be more critical. Some cases in construction management such as project management philosophies, processes, methods and tools are important but the most important part in this field is a capability of Architect as a project manager. Finding the right project manager for a construction project is the most important task in project implementation and execution.

The objectives of the study are to assess the terms of agreement of employment between the Architect and the client, to determine the roles, skills and personal characteristics of architects required to overcome challenges as an effective project manager, to identify the challenges faced by the consultant architect as project managers and to study the authority of the architect as a superintending officer as stated in the PAM <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract.</b> The data are collected through questionnaires and interviews.

It defines their characteristic features and describes the main types of their management, organization and contractual relationships.

Theoretically the use of contractual procedures, as prescribed in <b>standard</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> is to establish a high degree of rationality on an inherently unpredictable and irrational situation that is the construction project. Thus research questions were directed to elucidate how and why contractual procedures are used whenever construction professionals are doing their task. Data to be collected is the thoughts and actions of the professionals who used procedures in dealing with a specific task. However, {{there is a possibility that}} speakers may mean something different from what they say to show that the account of a particular activity is rational or justified. Thus content analysis of the semi-structured interviews were conducted to discover the meanings that a respondent actually alluded to since it is located and indexed within the expressions used to describe, explain or justify a specific task, event or occasion. Finally, framing {{the research}} within a case study methodology ensures the preservation of the unitary character of the social object being studied.

Content analysis of the semi- structured interviews were conducted to discover the meanings that a respondent actually alluded to since it is located and indexed within the expressions used to describe, explain or justify a specific task, event or occasion. The interviews were recorded, transcribed to written form and text. Due to the massive amount of data, the coding framework was approached by utilising a computer software that permits manipulation and proper categorisation and retrieval. Finally, framing {{the research}} within a case study methodology ensures the preservation of the unitary character of the social object being studied. Findings indicate that although construcion professionals are influenced by procedures and/or rules codified in <b>standard</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract,</b> other traces also present. The findings could be used to identify more robust drafting policies <b>of</b> newer <b>standard</b> <b>forms</b> or conditions <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> rather than insuanating that present documents are less than ideal due to its clarity or other factors that suggest that the contract is the main source of conflicts and disputes. The mode of inquiy adopted means that the research is not concerned with noting frequency or occurences of usage contractual procedures and/or rules but rather illustrate and identify these influences. ...|$|R
40|$|Building Information Modelling (BIM) {{changes the}} way {{information}} is generated, managed and communicated between project team members. It is gaining international attention {{as a potential}} way of improving {{the efficiency of the}} construction industry but, despite the recognised benefits of BIM, perceived barriers are restricting its adoption. Some of these barriers could be addressed through <b>standard</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> construction <b>contract.</b> The CIOB’s Complex Projects Contract 2013 (CPC 2013) is the first <b>standard</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> construction <b>contract</b> to include BIM clauses in its provisions and appendices. To investigate how CPC 2013 attempts to address the perceived barriers of BIM adoption and promote working in a BIM environment, a content analysis is undertaken. The research found that although CPC 2013 addresses some of the perceived barriers, in its <b>standard</b> <b>form,</b> the contract may require amendments and special conditions to support a “Level 2 ” environment...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to examine the}} provision of clauses on variations in the <b>standard</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> commonly used in the local construction industry i. e. the PWD Form 203 for building and civil engineering works in the public sector, the PAM Form for building and the IEM Form for the civil engineering works both in the private sector. It touches all aspects of variationsi both academically and in practice especially {{on the need to}} have variation clauses in the contract, its definition, application and more importantly the method of pricing. This could be something different from what has been encountered during the practical application on site. It also explains why adherence to the terms <b>of</b> <b>contract</b> in the contract administration especially on the pricing and payment will benefit both parties in a long ru...|$|R
