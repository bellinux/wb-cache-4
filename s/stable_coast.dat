Location of the research is along the coastal from Barombong Beach in south to the Tanjung Bunga Beach the north about 8. 5 km length. The research method is drilling at Barombong Beach, Tanjung Bayang Beach, Tanjung Merdeka Beach, and Tanjung Bunga Beach about 10 meters ??? 11 meters depths [...] The sediment of core drilling were analyzed sedimentary texture, structures and compositions. Data of sediment backshore was correlated. Based on the analyzed of core drilling, the backshore sediment on the study area consist of sands, silts, clays, clay and sand with organic matter content. Sediment backshore at Barombong Beach shows a model of marine sediment, while at Tanjung Bayang Beach, Tanjung Medeka Beach, and Tanjung Bunga Beach show a model of fluviatil delta sediment [...] These sediments consist of delta plain sediment, delta front sediment, beach sand sediment, and foreshore sediment.

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} {{numerical model}} for large-scale dynamics of shoreline and nearshore bathymetry under wave action {{is applied to}} investigate the long-term evolution of a rectilinear coast dominated by high angle wave incidence, which is perturbed by a nourishment or an offshore borrow pit. Previous studies show that a coastline can be unstable due to high angle wave instability, which results from the feedback between shoreline changes and the wave field. In contrast to traditional one-line shoreline models, which always predict a diffusional behaviour, this instability {{can lead to the}} growth of shoreline perturbations. Model results suggest that due to high angle wave instability a nourishment or a borrow pit could trigger the formation of a shoreline sand wave train (alternating accretional and erosional zones). Its formation is a selforganised response of the morphodynamic system and {{can be seen as a}} spatial-temporal instability. New sand waves are formed downdrift while the old sand waves migrate downdrift and increase in amplitude and wavelength. Instability develops only if the bathymetric changes related to shoreline perturbations extend to a depth where the wave angle is greater than the critical angle of 42 °. The potential for coastline instability is therefore limited by the wave incidence angle at the depth of closure and not the angle at deep water as suggested in previous studies. Including a fraction of low angle waves to the wave climate causes saturation of the amplitudes of the sand waves and limits the formation of the sand wave train. Even on a <b>stable</b> <b>coast</b> dominated by low angle waves, the feedback between morphology and the wave field can be crucial for the prediction of nourishment evolution. This feedback leads to relatively slow diffusion of shoreline perturbations and it can lead to downdrift migration. While some existing observations describe downdrift advection, no satisfactory explanation had been provided previously. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} has revealed much geomorphological evidence for major tsunamis on the southeastern coast of Australia prior to British settlement in 1788. This discovery {{is important because}} this tectonically very <b>stable</b> <b>coast</b> {{was believed to be}} safe from the hazard of tsunamis because no major tsunami has occurred here in the last 200 years. But high level marine deposits of Holocene age along the coast south of Sydney show that tsunamis ran up to heights of 3 ̆e 30 m, and at one site to heights probably 3 ̆e 100 m. Developing a chronology for these catastrophic events is of great importance to the study of coastal geomorphology and to coastal hazard planning. Here we outline a chronology based on 22 C 14 ages and 23 TL (thermo¬luminescence) ages from sites along 400 km of coast. The grouping of these dates indicates that at least 5, and probably 6 major tsunamis struck this coast during the Holocene. These events occurred at about 250, 500 - 800, 1, 600 - 1, 900, 3, 000, 6, 500 and 8, 700 - 9, 000 years ago. The frequency of these events was about 1 in 1, 300 years over the whole Holocene, but increased to about 1 in 600 years during the last 3, 000 years. This is the same frequency as the tectonically active Ryukyu Islands. Fre¬quent tsunamis can be a major hazard on coasts far from tectonically mobile areas. C 14 ages on shells associated with the deposits, and TL ages of sand exposed to solar radiation, provide the most reliable guides to the timing of tsunami impact. We also demonstrate that sand transported rapidly onshore by tsunamis during the Holocene can retain a Pleistocene TL signal. TL analysis thus provides an important new tool for the identification of ancient tsunami deposits...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Assessment of {{long term}} erosion and {{accretion}} {{rate of the}} coastal area is essential for selection {{of different types of}} coastal structures. For example, it is not advisable to develop housing infrastructure on the coast, which is historically eroding. Similarly it is not preferable to select an accreting site {{for the construction of a}} port in order to avoid annual maintenance dredging after construction of the port. Kuwait is a coastal country and hence it is essential to understand the long term coastal morphological changes of the coast and identify the historically accreting or eroding or <b>stable</b> <b>coast</b> over a period of many years, say 10 to 15 years. The coastline evolution of Kuwait is investigated using Landsat remote sensing images (30 m resolution) from 1989 to 2003, IRS-P 5 images (2. 5 m resolution) obtained for the year 2006 - 07 and 2003 aerial photos (0. 38 m resolution). A total of 130 grids, each at a spacing of 1 nautical mile is used. The extent of accretion/erosion for 17 years (from 1989 to 2006) for the mainland coastline of Kuwait is assessed. The average shoreline change/year is calculated. Erosion and accretion index for each location is assigned based on the average annual erosion and accretion. From this study, it is found that annual erosion of more than 25 m does not exist in Kuwait. 1. 54 % of the coast has experienced annual erosion of 10 to 25 m and 0. 77 % of the coast has experienced 0 to 10 m annual erosion. 3. 85 % of the coast is stable. 43. 85 % of the coast has annual accretion of 0 to 10 m, 11. 54 % has annual accretion of 10 to 25 m and 38. 46 % has annual accretion of greater than 25 m.

40|$|The {{internal}} structure of coastal foredunes from three sites {{along the north}} Norfolk coast has been investigated using ground-penetrating radar (GPR), which provides a unique insight into the {{internal structure}} of these dunes that cannot be achieved by any other non-destructive or geophysical technique. Combining geomorphological and geophysical investigations into the structure and morphology of these coastal foredunes has enabled a more accurate determination of their development and evolution. The radar profiles show the internal structures, which include foreslope accretion, trough cut and fill, roll-over and beach deposits. Foredune ridges contain large sets of low-angle cross-stratification from dune foreslope accretion with trough-shaped structures from cut and fill on the crest and rearslope. Foreslope accretion indicates sand supply from the beach to the foreslope, while troughs on the dune crest and rearslope are attributed to reworking by offshore winds. Bounding surfaces between dunes are clearly resolved and reveal the relative chronology of dune emplacement. Radar sequence boundaries within dunes have been traced below the water-table passing into beach erosion surfaces. These are believed to result from storm activity, which erodes the upper beach and dunes. In one example, at Brancaster, a dune scarp and erosion surface may be correlated with erosion in the 1950 s, possibly the 1953 storm. Results suggest that dune ridge development is intimately linked {{to changes in the}} shoreline, with dune development associated with coastal progradation while dunes are eroded during storms and, where beaches are eroding, a <b>stable</b> <b>coast</b> provides more time for dune development, resulting in higher foredune ridges. A model for coastal dune evolution is presented, which illustrates stages of dune development in response to beach evolution and sand supply. In contrast to many other coastal dune fields where the prevailing wind is onshore, on the north Norfolk coast, the prevailing wind is directed along the coast and offshore, which reduces the landward migration of sand dunes...|$|E

Our paper examines some unpublished millstones sites in southern Italy: Capo d’Orlando and Letojanni in Sicily; Soverato, Tropea and Capo dell’Armi in Calabria; Palinuro, Scario and Castellabate in Campania, San Vito- Polignano in Apulia. A review of the use of these artefacts shows the long lasting use of the cylindrical millstone with diameters larger than one meter as a useful tool for processing oil and cereals; their longevity makes it difficult to specify the chronological range {{of the majority of the}} studied sites; only one site provides an accurate chronological period of the quarry: at Molare Scario (Sa), due to the presence of stratigraphic deposits dated by radiocarbon. The submergence and age of this site well fit the predicted sea level at the time of their excavation. Using this site as a reference, we have tentatively estimated the age and the elevation with respect to the past mean sea level, for the millstone quarries located at S.

40|$|Permafrost coasts {{represent}} 34 % of {{the global}} coastline {{and are likely to}} become one of the most impacted environments of the Earth under changing climate conditions. The lengthening of the open-water season and the increasing open-water area, the warming of permafrost, the increasing occurrence of coastal thermokarst, and the increase in sea surface temperatures are all thought to impact the pace of coastal erosion. In particular, storms are predicted to hit the coasts later in the fall season. These storms are thought to bear staggering threats to the coasts in the form of destruction of community and industry infrastructure as well as dramatic changes in sedi-ment and nutrient pathways in the nearshore zone. Alas, there is little data available to provide a cir-cumarctic picture of coastal erosion and to indicate erosion trends. Indeed, arctic coasts remain largely unknown and unexplored, which puts current adap-tation and mitigation strategies in northern commu-nities into jeopardy. In this presentation, we present the latest results from the Arctic Coastal Dynamics project, initiated by the International Permafrost Association and the International Arctic Science Committee in 1999. A classification, built to consistently describe the geo-morphological characteristics and processes ob-served at the coast along the arctic rim, indicates that the geomorphological setting of arctic coasts is highly spatially variable. This dataset highlights the major influence of this setting on the erosion rates observed and the in fine difficulty in providing sta-tistics at the global level. It shows, however that some striking regional traits can be deduced from the dataset. Alaskan and Canadian coasts in the Beaufort Sea are characterized by larger ground ice contents but also by much smaller cliff heights than other arctic coasts. Overall it shows that circumpolar coastal erosion is on average 0. 5 m/yr, but again with strong differences between arctic regions, with rates close to 10 m/yr in some areas and <b>stable</b> <b>coasts</b> in others. A second outcome of the ACD project is a recent as-sessment of erosion rates and their evolution throughout the second half of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first century. Despite the recent media attention to coastal erosion, reliable long-term datasets asserting an increase in coastal erosion are scarce in the Arctic.

40|$|Mid-Holocene age fossil-fringing reefs occur {{along the}} tectonically <b>stable</b> north <b>coast</b> of Java, Indonesia, {{presenting}} {{an opportunity for}} sea level and paleoclimate reconstruction. The fossil reef at Point Teluk Awur, near Jepara, Central Java, contains two directly superposed horizons of Porites lobata microatolls. Corals in the lower horizon, 80 cm above modern sea level, yielded Uranium series dates of 7090 ± 90 year BP, while corals in the upper horizon at 1. 5 m grew at 6960 ± 60 year BP. These dates match the transgressive phase of regional sea-level curves, but suggest a mid-Holocene highstand somewhat older than that recorded on mid-Pacific islands. Paleotemperature was calibrated using Sr/Ca and δ 18 O values of a modern P. lobata coral and the locally measured sea surface temperature (SST), yielding SST–Sr/Ca and SST–δ 18 O calibration equations [T Sr/Ca = 91. 03 – 7. 35 (Sr/Ca) and Tδ 18 O = − 3. 77 to − 5. 52 (δ 18 O) ]. The application of the local equations to Sr/Ca and δ 18 O measurements on these corals yielded a range of temperatures of 28. 8 ± 1. 7 °C, {{comparable to that of}} the modern Java Sea (28. 4 ± 0. 7 °C).

Large differences between the δ 15 N values of mullets and those of food sources (6. 0 ‰ on average) showed that YoY are secondary consumers, like older individuals, when feeding in the salt marsh.

40|$|International audienceThe Kerkennah {{archipelago}} in Tunisia {{is vulnerable}} to sea erosion and different marks of coastline retreat indicate that this process is currently active. Our objective is to quantify coastal erosion and to discuss the management of risks along the coastline. For that purpose, we used both photointerpretation and field approaches, and integrated all the collected information into a GIS. The quantification of coastline evolution was done using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) module in the ArcGis 10 software. We focused on 2 dates for which comparable data with a spatial resolution of 2. 5 m were available: 1963 {{with the use of}} 33 aerial photographs and 2010 {{with the use of a}} SPOT 5 panchromatic image. Aerial photographs have been georeferenced on the SPOT 5 image, and the coastline has been determined for the two dates following the cliff tops or the limit of the vegetation when there was no cliff. The 6 studied areas correspond to the coasts where the error margin is of 6 meters (minimal error). The comparison of coastline between 1963 and 2010 shows that for a large majority of the studied areas, the coastline is either stable or retreating. The <b>stable</b> <b>coasts</b> concern 46. 9 % of the studied areas when eroded coasts concern 50. 4 %. Erosion reaches 42 m ± 6 m in the touristic area of SidiFrej (or 0, 9 m/yr in 47 yrs) and depends on different factors of vulnerability including lithology, sea level rise and anthropic activities. On the opposite, on some very limited areas, the coastline has advanced between the two dates (until 34 m ± 6 m) and those advancing patterns are strongly correlated to human infrastructures. The management of the coastline is of 3 types: (i) no intervention; (ii) intervention by the state or (iii) intervention by the local population, more specifically individual actions taken by residents of the coastline. In the areas where the coastline is free of human infrastructures, the coast is either eroded or stable, but never in progradation. In the area where the coastline is protected the evolution rates alternate between progradation, stability and erosion. The states infrastructures are localised in the different harbours, along the coast of Ramla (the biggest locality of Kerkennah) and along a part of the SidiFrej touristic area. They are continuous along the coasts and consist in majority of rockfill (along the coast or dikes) to protect the coasts from erosion, and in minority of embankments to raise the roads along the coasts or to gain land surface especially on the back of certain rockfill. These infrastructures are recent and often correlated with either a stagnation of the coastline or an artificial progradation of the land. They thus appear to be effective, although only at a very local scale. Besides, unprotected areas adjacent to rockfill infrastructures show signs of recent erosion, which might indicate the existence of negative side effects. The areas protected locally by individual actions are not continuous and constitute small fractions of the coastline. The rapid alternation between protected and unprotected areas show that for the moment and despite some efforts, there is no global and integrated management to counteract the erosion of the coast the small islands of the Kerkennah archipelago...|$|R

Seven areas were investigated, evidencing flights of up to seven marine terraces with elevations reaching up to 360 in {{above mean sea level}} (amsl). Dating of the terraces was made using the Infra Red Stimulated Luminescence (IRSL) technique on sands as old as MIS 9 (similar to 330 ka). C- 14 and U-series dates were obtained from fossil shells for geochronological cross control. Mean uplift rates along the Talara Arc range from about 0. 10 up to 0. 50 mm/ yr. The strongest uplift is observed in the Manta Peninsula of Ecuador in front of the subduction of the Carnegie Ridge. The uplift rate tends to slow down towards the northern and southern ends of the Talara Arc and then the transition toward the <b>stable</b> or subsiding <b>coasts</b> of central Peru and northern Ecuador and Colombia is sharp.

The Canterbury Plains {{are up to}} 70 km wide and 185 km long, {{covering}} approximately 8000 km 2. The Plains are dominated by extreme geological and geomorphological processes — primarily climate, tectonics, and wave climate. The Canterbury gravels are primarily the deposits resulting from the coalescence of broad fluvial megafans that flowed into a high-energy coastal environment. Most fluvial channels in the basin are gravelly braided rivers. During the present sea-level highstand, {{a large portion of}} the plains can be considered as being situated in a low accommodation setting. Most sediment progradation and aggradation occurred and took place near the end of multiple glacial maxima and their associated sea level lowstands. As such, the fluvial megafans are nonmarine lowstand to early transgressive deposits. Valley entrenchment subsequently took place on the seaward side of the plains during the ensuing sea level rise and highstand.

Atlantic <b>coast.</b> <b>Stable</b> isotope (d 13 C, d 18 O and 87 Sr: 86 Sr) and elemental (Mg:Ca, Mn:Ca, Sr:Ca and Ba:Ca) signatures in otoliths of juvenile American shad from rivers from Georgia to New Hampshire varied significantly, allowing {{for an average of}} 91 % cross-validated accuracy when classifying individual fish to their natal rivers. We also found significant interannual variability in the geochemical signatures from several rivers, due largely to differences in d 18 O values among years. We then used the ground-truthed geochemical signatures in the otoliths of juvenile American shad to identify the natal origins of spawning adults in the York River system in Virginia. Approximately 6 % of the spawning adults collected in the York River were strays from other rivers. Of the remaining fish, 79 % were spawned in the Mattaponi River and 21 % in the Pamunkey River. The combined results of this and other recent studies suggest that although most American shad spawning in the York River were homing to their natal river, there was much less fidelity to individual tributaries. Small-scale straying could allow fish spawned in the Mattaponi River to subsidize spawning in the Pamunkey River, which has experienced persistent recruitment failure...|$|R

In combination {{with data from}} the final marine flooding phase of the incised Mekong River valley, the sea-level history of South Vietnam could be reconstructed for the last 8000 years. Connecting saltmarsh, mangrove and beachrock deposits the record covers the last phase of deglacial sea-level rise from - 5 to + 1. 4 m between 8. 1 to 6. 4 ka. The rates of sea-level rise decreased sharply after the rapid early Holocene rise and stabilized {{at a rate of}} 4. 5 mm/year between 8. 0 and 6. 9 ka. Southeast Vietnam beachrocks reveal that the mid-Holocene sea-level highstand slightly above + 1. 4 m was reached between 6. 7 and 5. 0 ka, with a peak value close to + 1. 5 m around 6. 0 ka. This highstand is further limited by a backshore and beachridge deposit that marks the maximum springtide sea-level just below the base of the overlying beach ridge. After 5. 0 ka sea level dropped below + 1. 4 m and fell almost linearly at a rate of 0. 24 mm/year until 0. 63 ka and + 0. 2 m as evidenced by the youngest beachrocks. The Holocene sea-level fluctuations observed in Southeast Vietnam resulted from eustatic and isostatic processes. The sea-level rise up to the mid-Holocene highstand was provoked by the last melting phase of glacial polar ice-sheets. The sea-level drop after the mid-Holocene highstand was induced by the isostatic processes of continental levering with an uplift of continents in low latitudes and depression of adjacent flooded continental shelf areas and Equatorial Ocean Siphoning transferring oceanic waters from low latitudes to the increasing volume of oceanic basins in higher latitudes. The regional expression in terms of magnitude and timing of relative sea-level change might contribute to validation of geophysical model simulations...|$|R
