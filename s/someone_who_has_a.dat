There's no acting involved at all. But he's got a girlfriend so Ruby has {{to find a way to}} justify going after <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> girlfriend. So that's kind of hard. But he's the hero. She believes he's the love of her life. I guess with that in mind you wouldn't let anything get in the way of that. Who knows, he might be." [...] However Breeds previously revealed she did not want the pair to romance each other, due to her real life relationship with Mitchell. Mitchell himself had also revealed he did not want the pair to start a romance. In comparison to her willingness to take him from Indigo, Breeds said Ruby would not have done the same whilst Romeo was with her best friend Annie Campbell (Charlotte Best).|$|E

500|$|Kubrick {{found that}} Dr. Strangelove, a $2 million {{production}} which employed {{what became the}} [...] "first important visual effects crew in the world", {{would be impossible to}} make in the U.S. for various technical and political reasons, forcing him to move production to England. It was shot in 15 weeks, ending in April 1963, after which Kubrick spent eight months editing it. Peter Sellers again agreed to work with Kubrick, and ended up playing three different roles in the film. Upon release, the film stirred up much controversy and mixed opinions. The New York Times film critic Bosley Crowther worried that it was a [...] "discredit and even contempt for our whole defense establishment... the most shattering sick joke I've ever come across", [...] while Robert Brustein of Out of This World in a February 1970 article called it a [...] "juvenalian satire". Kubrick responded to the criticism, stating: [...] "A satirist is <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> very skeptical view of human nature, but who still has the optimism to make some sort of a joke out of it. However brutal that joke might be". Today, the film is considered {{to be one of the}} sharpest comedy films ever made, and holds a near perfect 99% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 68 reviews as of August 2015. It was voted the 39th-greatest American film and third-greatest comedy film of all time by the American Film Institute, and in 2010, it was voted the sixth-best comedy film of all time by The Guardian.|$|E
500|$|Niffenegger {{began writing}} the novel in 1997; the last scene, {{in which an}} aged Clare is waiting for Henry, was written first, {{because it is the}} story's focal point. The {{narrative}} was originally structured thematically. Responding to comments from readers of early drafts of the manuscript, Niffenegger reorganized the narrative so that it largely followed Clare's timeline. The work was finished in 2001. With no history of commercial publication, Niffenegger had trouble finding interested literary agents—25 rejected the manuscript. In 2002, she sent it unsolicited to the small, San Francisco-based publisher MacAdam/Cage, where it reached Anika Streitfeld. Streitfeld, who became Niffenegger's editor, [...] "thought it was incredible. Right from the very beginning you feel like you are in capable hands, that this is <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> story to tell and who knows how to tell it." [...] She gave it to David Poindexter, the founder of the publishing firm, [...] "who read it overnight and decided to buy the book". However, Niffenegger had acquired an agent by this time, and several publishing houses in New York City were interested in the novel. The manuscript was put up for auction and MacAdam/Cage bid US$100,000, by far the largest sum it had ever offered for a book. Although another publisher outbid them, Niffenegger selected MacAdam/Cage because they were so dedicated to her work. Also, Niffenegger explains that her [...] "own natural inclination is to go small. My background is in punk music—I'd always pick the indie company over the giant corporation." ...|$|E

Along with prayer and fasting, {{it is considered}} a pillar of the personal spiritual practices of the Orthodox Christian tradition.

2500|$|As yet, the UK has not {{consolidated}} a single statutory {{definition of the}} people to whom employment rights and duties apply. Statute and case law, both domestic and European, use 2 main definitions (employee and worker), and approximately 3 other minor types (jobholder, apprentice, and someone with an employment relation). The EU does have one consolidated definition of a ‘worker’, which is <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> contract for work in return for a wage, or an indirect quid pro quo (as in a communal cooperative), and also stands as the more vulnerable party to the contract.

2500|$|Kaufman {{saw that}} {{mechanisms}} such as blame or contempt {{may be used}} as a defending strategy against the experience of shame and that <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> pattern of applying them to himself may well attempt to defend against a shame experience by applying self-blame or self-contempt.

The behavior of attacking somebody en masse for his/her viewpoints or particular words. This can especially refer to cyber bullying).

2500|$|The most {{important}} {{point about the}} Act {{is that there is}} some confusion about whom it covers. Most British people will be covered, but often vulnerable workers are not.

This in turn means <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>a</b> [...] "contract of service". In legal cases since the early 1980s, some judges have placed a restrictive interpretation on what that means. The opposite of a [...] "contract of service" [...] is a [...] "contract for services", and it is meant to draw the line between someone who is working for another, on their account, under their control and someone who is working on their own account, controlling their own work.
