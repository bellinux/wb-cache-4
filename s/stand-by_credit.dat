The loan allocated $36 million to compensate for a drop in coffee prices and $48 million as <b>stand-by</b> <b>credit.</b> The <b>stand-by</b> <b>credit</b> was met with conditionality, including [...] "liberalization of exchange rate and trade policies, the [...] of its interest and pricing policies, {{and the increase in}} credit for private industry."While the aid was intended to stabilize the economy, there is speculation as to whether the funds were used to support the Salvadoran government's efforts against the guerrillas.The motivation behind the loan was questioned by critics of the US and IMF involvement in foreign politics.|$|E
50|$|In late December {{the plan}} was {{approved}} by the International Monetary Fund. The IMF's support was especially important because the national debt in various foreign banks and governments reached an amount of US$42.3 billion (64,8% of GDP) in 1989. The IMF granted Poland with a stabilization fund of US$1 billion and an additional <b>stand-by</b> <b>credit</b> of US$720 million. Following this the World Bank granted Poland additional credits for modernization of exports of Polish goods and food products. Many governments followed and paid off some of the former Communist debt (about 50% of the sum of debt capital and all cumulated interest rates to 2001).|$|E
50|$|Uruguay, while a {{beneficiary}} of IMF intervention, {{has not gone}} under any substantial macroeconomic changes mandated by the IMF. No projects have been enacted in the Latin American state, however, multiple arrangements have been made for the IMF to provide the country with varying amounts of <b>stand-by</b> <b>credit</b> (funds {{to be used as}} a last resort in the event of due payment to a third party by Uruguay), the first of which was arranged in 1996. This is in line with the institution's goal of achieving and supporting economic stability. These standby credit lines started during a time of significant economic growth (5% year-over-year), but also at a time of heavy dollarization (alignment with/dependency on the U.S. Dollar). For context, as of 2008, 60% of bank loans use U.S. Dollars as opposed to the national currency, the Uruguayan peso.|$|E

50|$|During the 1990-91 Persian Gulf War, Yemen {{supported}} Iraq in its {{invasion of}} Kuwait, thereby alienating Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which both had provided critical {{financial assistance to}} Yemen. In addition to withdrawing this aid, Saudi Arabia expelled almost 1 million Yemeni workers. The resultant fall in expatriate remittances had a disastrous impact on Yemen's governmental budget. The civil war of 1994 further drained the economy, and in 1995 Yemen sought the aid of multilateral agencies. In 1996 the International Monetary Fund (IMF) granted Yemen a US$190 million <b>stand-by</b> <b>credit</b> facility, and the following year it approved two funding facilities that increased the country's credit by approximately US$500 million. The funding was contingent on Yemen's adoption of stringent economic reforms, a requirement that the country had limited success in fulfilling. As a result, the IMF suspended lending to Yemen from late 1999 until February 2001. The extension of the two funding facilities, particularly the poverty reduction and growth facility (PRGF), through October 2001 was again contingent on Yemen's commitment to economic reform. Because of Yemen's failure to comply sufficiently with the terms imposed by the IMF, since 2002 the IMF has withheld US$300 million in concessional financing. Discussions over the renewal of the PRGF are ongoing. In 2000 Kuwait and Saudi Arabia resumed financial aid to Yemen.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a model that}} captures important features of debt crises of the Brazilian type. Its applicability to Brazil lies in the facts that (1) macroeconomic fundamentals were relatively sound {{in the wake of}} the crisis (e. g., a nonnegligible primary surplus, a relatively low debt-GDP ratio, and low inflation); and (2) the trigger for the crisis—forthcoming elections with an expected regime change— appears to be extraneous. We rationalize the sort of circularity involved in a coun-try’s credit rating. In particular, we show how country credit ratings could bring about unstable macroeconomic behavior, and explore the implications of such behavior for fiscal policy. [JEL F 21, F 34, G 15] Brazil’s public finances appeared to have been in a shambles prior to the elec-tion in October 2002. The September 2002 <b>stand-by</b> <b>credit</b> gave Brazil a crit-ical boost, providing the central bank with an additional $ 16 billion in international reserves to defend its weak currency and thereby to contain the explosion of dollar-linked public debt service. 1 The package also included a promise to increase the available funds to $ 30 billion, if the primary surplus had increased. Because three-fourths of Brazil’s debt is in domestic currency, and about one-third of this debt i...|$|E
40|$|Based on the Executive Board’s {{guidance}} {{during the}} first stage of the Review of Low Income Countries (LIC) Facilities, this paper suggests a number of refinements to the facilities and instruments that are consistent with the self-sustainability of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust (PRGT). The proposals seek to improve the tailoring and flexibility of Fund support. Taken together with those advanced in the parallel paper on PRGT eligibility, they are projected to keep the average annual demand for PRGT resources within a range consistent with the Board’s approved strategy to make the PRGT self-sustaining over the period 2013 – 35. The proposals are as follows. Enhancement of the existing blending policy. Members that are currently presumed to blend would use a somewhat higher share of General Resources Account (GRA) resources, thereby releasing concessional resources for poorer members. Some changes are also proposed to the existing market access criteria for blending. On average the changes are projected to shift demand of some SDR 100 million per year from the PRGT to the GRA over the period 2013 – 35. Access Policy: a decision would be adopted now to halve access norms and limits in relation to quota when the quota increase under the Fourteenth General Review of Quotas comes into effect. The norms and limits were doubled in 2009 and appear broadly appropriate to meet LICs ’ needs. Staff’s proposal would imply unchanged access in SDR terms for most LICs after the new quotas come into effect. Within the self-sustained framework, even a modest nominal access increase now would compress significantly the size of access increases that the PRGT could accommodate in the future, meaning that access as a share of GDP would decline for future users. Modifications to enhance precautionary support and respond more quickly to additional financing needs: For <b>Stand-by</b> <b>Credit</b> Facility (SCF) arrangements treated as precautionary, easing time limitations on use, and allowing more frontloading of access, would make the instrument more helpful to members...|$|E

40|$|The {{documentary}} credit or {{letter of credit}} is {{and has been for}} many centuries a fundamental instrument of international commerce. The characteristics of simplicity of use and of legendary reliability found in this mechanism of payment have induced the parties involved in world trade {{to use it as a}} guarantee to the execution of all kinds of legal obligations such as the full completion of construction work, financing, payment of customs duties or taxes, judicial bonds and even promises of marriage. This master's thesis specifically concerns letters of credit used as a guarantee which are called in the trade "stand-by letters of credit". The first title presents the instrument in a practical context illustrating its principles with examples. The second title examines the legal aspects as such of the <b>stand-by</b> letter of <b>credit</b> while trying to circumscribe the nature of the instrument in law. Finally, in the third title, the cases where the functions and integrity of the instrument are tested are studied thereby identifying the legal strength of <b>stand-by</b> letters of <b>credit</b> recognized by the courts of different jurisdictions. This study has enabled me to discover that this instrument is not as well suited to be a guarantee than it is to be a payment mechanism. In fact, its principles of function which are assets when used as a payment can become sources of flagrant injustice in the eyes of courts of certain jurisdictions when used as a guarantee...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasingly}} emphasized {{need for}} global {{communication in the}} business {{has led to the}} emergence of the Electronic Data Interchange - EDI. This phenomenon begins to develop at the time when computers were first used in everyday life. For the significance of the modern electronic trades can best testify those subjects from the highly developed countries that are using them for complete execution of all transactions. When we talk about the legal issues in the e-commerce, especially we are referring to the legal issues center around the digital signature, the place and the time of conclusion of the contract, the transfer of funds, <b>stand-by</b> letters of <b>credit,</b> international arbitration over the Internet etc. For easier understanding of these terms, it is essential the uniformed rules of international and regional organizations that regulate the aforementioned issues to be taken as a basis. As in the international also and in the domestic regulations that are applicable to electronic commerce, there are many significant obstacles, so from there comes and the justification of the caution with which certain rules are formulated. Doing this it is especially important to take care not to violate the norms of the domicile law (with special emphasis on those of a peremptory nature). In this section is particularly important that the process of unification of the rules for electronic commerce it was conducted and is still conducting quite favorable because after its occurrence this area in neither country was thoroughly regulated, so that why {{there was no need to}} change some established domestic practices and adopted regulations. The above stated proves that the non-provision of uniform standards in the commercial communications is leading to uncertainty for the businesses that are going out on the electronic market. Therefore, by the international and regional organizations are taken a series of actions to bring order to this area by using the means of the legislation, which would allow the proper working of the participants in this market.

40|$|Economies {{benefit from}} {{international}} trade, but joining {{the world market}} also exposes them to external shocks. How can the government in Eastern European and developing countries reduce their vulnerability to such shocks? What are appropriate policy responses? The authors examine how external shocks (such as commodity price changes, variations in global demand, and fluctuating interest) affect economic performance, and how those effects are mitigated by the right policy responses at the right time. They introduce a methodology for measuring the effect on current account of external shocks and apply it for the Philippines. They rationalize balance of payments responses to external shocks and domestic policies in a theoretical model of a small open economy. Did the Philippines choose the appropriate policies when faced with balance of payments disequilibrium? Among comparable Asian countries, the Philippines in 1970 enjoyed a relatively high per capita income that has since failed to keep pace. Why? Adverse shocks did not help, but {{other countries in the}} region experienced similar shocks and performed better. The Philippines relied heavily on external flow, which fueled an investment boom. Given low real interest rates at the time, this seemed a reasonable approach - but there were two flaws to it. First, the investments were poorly conceived, were mismanaged, failed to produce appropriate returns, and became a burden on the state. One large nuclear power plant has yet to yield a return. Second, with so many external resources available, the government ignored the need for meaningful structural reform, especially in trade and public resources and distortionary trade policies can absorb more than all the gains from favorable shocks. When external conditions improved in the mid- 1980 s, the Philippines could not take advantage of them because of its heavy external debt and its cumbersome trade regime. Had authorities introduced structural reform (liberalizing trade, strengthening public finance, and freezing up factor markets), the economy could have more easily absorbed the impact of unfavorable shocks. In 1991, the IMF gave the Philippines a <b>stand-by</b> <b>credit.</b> Authorities are now addressing some structural problems by liberalizing the exchange rate, removing import tariffs, and restructuring the public sector, including the Central Bank. Perhaps this will allow more sustainable growth and an economy that can more readily absorb external shocks...|$|E
