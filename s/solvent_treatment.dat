The thin films have been deposited onto glass substrates by a solution processable of spin-coating technique.

The influence of <b>solvent</b> <b>treatment</b> on the surface morphological properties has been investigated via a surface profilometer, absorption spectroscopy, Xray Diffraction Spectroscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM).

30|$|In conclusion, alcohol <b>solvent</b> <b>treatment</b> on PEDOT:PSS films {{has been}} {{proposed}} to improve the luminance of PeLEDs. Compared to EtOH and IPA, MeOH solvent is the most appropriate to improve PeLEDs performance, resulting in a Lmax of 2075  cd m− 2 and a CEmax of 0.38  cd A− 1. The luminance improvement {{can be attributed to}} the synergistic effect of alcohol <b>solvent</b> <b>treatment.</b> On the one hand, the higher the alcohol solvent polarity is, the more amount of PSS is taken away in the process of spin-coating alcohol solvent on PEDOT:PSS/ITO substrates. This will result in the higher conductivity of the treated PEDOT:PSS films, and more holes could be injected into perovskite active layer. On the other hand, the higher the alcohol polarity, the larger the surface energy of the PEDOT:PSS films, caused by their more uniform surface. The increased surface energy can restrain the Ostwald ripening and promote to grow smaller perovskite grains and better coverage, resulting in efficient radiative recombination. This provides that alcohol <b>solvent</b> <b>treatment</b> can be a valuable method to increase the baseline of PeLEDs performance, which will be widespread applicable in the future commercial production.|$|E

In case of poly(d,l-lactide) (DLPLA), {{it was observed}} that the surface {{segregation and}} the surface restructuring of methyl side groups are influenced by the polymer film thickness. This result has been confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). In the same way, PLGA thick films were also characterized by an extensive surface segregation of methyl side groups. Finally, surface restructuring was investigated by dynamic contact angle measurements and it was observed when film surface comes into contact with water. In parallel, we also found that poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) thin and clear films with thickness 15 μm undergo conformational changes on the surface upon <b>solvent</b> <b>treatment</b> with certain solvents. The solvent treated surface of PLLA becomes hazy and milky white and its hydrophobicity increases compared to untreated surface.
