40|$|Abstract Objective Hyperchromatic crowded groups (HCG), a term first {{introduced}} into the cytology literature by DeMay in 1995, are commonly observed in Pap tests and may rarely be associated with serious but difficult to interpret lesions. In this study, we specifically defined HCG as dark crowded cell groups with more than 15 cells which can be identified at 10 &# 215; <b>screening</b> <b>magnification.</b> Methods We evaluated consecutive liquid-based (Surepath) Pap tests from 601 women (age 17 &# 8211; 74 years, mean age 29. 4 yrs) and observed HCG in 477 cases. In all 477 HCG cases, Pap tests {{were found to be}} satisfactory and to contain an endocervical sample. HCG were easily detectible at 10 &# 215; <b>screening</b> <b>magnification</b> (size up to 400 um, mean 239. 5 um) and ranged from 1 to 50 (mean 19. 5) per Pap slide. Results HCG predominantly represented 3 -Dimensional groups of endocervical cells with some nuclear overlap (379 / 477 &# 8211; 79 %), reactive endocervical cells with relatively prominent nucleoli and some nuclear crowding (29 / 477 &# 8211; 6 %), clusters of inflammatory cells (25 / 477 &# 8211; 5. 2 %), parabasal cells (22 / 477 &# 8211; 4. 6 %), endometrial cells (1 / 477 &# 8211; 0. 2 %). Epithelial cell abnormalities (ECA) were present in only 21 of 477 cases (4. 6 %). 18 of 21 women with HCG-associated ECA were less than 40 years old; only 3 were =/> 40 years. HCG-associated final abnormal Pap test interpretations were as follows: ASCUS (6 / 21 &# 8211; 28 %), LSIL (12 / 21 &# 8211; 57 %), ASC-H (2 / 21 &# 8211; 9. 5 %), and HSIL/CIN 2 - 3 (3 / 21 &# 8211; 14 %). The association of HCG with ECA was statistically significant (p = 0. 0174. chi-square test). In patients with ECA, biopsy results were available in 10 cases, and 4 cases of biopsy-proven CIN 2 / 3 were detected. Among these four cases, HCG in the Pap tests, in retrospect represented the lesional high grade cells in three cases (one HSIL case and two ASC-H cases). Interestingly, none of the 124 cases without HCG were found to have an epithelial cell abnormality. Conclusion We conclude: a. HCG are observed in a high proportion of cervical smears. b. In the vast majority of cases, HCG are benign. c. ECA were only observed in cases with HCG. This observation is consistent with the hypothesis that the presence of HCG in Pap tests most often represents adequate sampling of the transformation zone, thus increasing the chances of detecting an epithelial cell abnormality. d. Only a few cases with HCG were associated with a serious ECA, but careful scrutiny of all HCG appears warranted to avoid the potential diagnostic pitfall of a significant false negative interpretation. </p...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{analyze the}} {{diagnostic}} accuracy of telediagnostic procedures for transbronchial fine needle aspirations. Material and Methods: A double blind study {{was performed on}} cytological slides of 54 randomly selected cases with transbronchial fine needle aspirations. The slides were digitized using a Leica digital camera DC 100 mounted on a microscope Leica Laborlux S, and analyzed by an experienced pathologist without knowing the definite diagnosis or any additional clinical data. The diagnoses stated by analyzing the digital images were compared to the final conventional diagnoses. In addition, {{the duration of the}} digital diagnosis, used magnifications, and difficulties for correct sampling were documented. Results: The “digital” diagnoses of the 54 cases were all in general agreement with the definite diagnoses. No wrong positive or wrong negative case in respect to malignant/non‐malignant (31 / 23) or to small cell/non‐small cell (9 / 22) occurred. The performance of a digital diagnosis lasted for 115 s at average (15 – 260 s), and is significantly longer compared to that of conventional fine needle aspiration judgement (20 s). The <b>screening</b> <b>magnification</b> was commonly set to × 2. 5, that for definite diagnostic analysis × 40. Benign diseases (2 tuberculosis and 3 sarcoidosis cases) were correctly classified. Conclusions: Telepathology systems can probably be used for fine needle aspiration analysis without major diagnostic errors.

In this paper, we present a new concept for magnification software. It uses different views to support the user efficiently in different situations.

40|$|Low {{vision is}} any chronic form of visual impairment, not correctable by glasses or {{contacts}} that adversely affects performance of important everyday visual tasks. Most {{people with low}} vision need magnified text to read. On a fixed-size computer <b>screen,</b> the <b>magnification</b> of text trades off against {{the proportion of the}} entire screen visible. To read hypertext, simultaneous access to the full-screen page is important for skimming text and for locating hyperlinks. Therefore, people with low vision using magnified text might encounter difficulties reading hypertext, especially when hyperlinks are placed at unpredictable locations (true for most webpages). We investigated hypertext information retrieval as the time taken and number of nodes traversed to answer a series of questions. In Experiment 1, low-vision performance for reading prose and hypertext was compared to normal performance: low-vision performance deficits in hypertext retrieval were predictable from deficits in conventional prose reading. Experiment 2 evaluated the effect of web-page layout on low-vision performance: retrieval performance was severely affected when hyperlinks had unpredictable locations. This extra deficit was eliminated when users were provided with simultaneous access to full-screen layout. Based on these findings, we discuss the accessibility of the Internet by people with low vision...|$|R
40|$|Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is a {{reliable}} technique by which geologi cal objects can be <b>screened</b> with <b>magnification</b> ranges between that of optic al microscopy and the nanoscale. It is, therefore, {{suitable for the}} study of iberulites, which are pinkish mineral micr ospherules, formed and structured in the troposphere, and composed of complex mineral associations whose pha ses have diverse hygroscopic properties. These mineral phases are mainly silicates, carbonates, sulphates, halides, oxides and phosphates. Othe r minor but not less important compounds are the biological constituents. The sources of such heterogeneous materials ar e the soils of North Africa which, once dispersed into the atmosphere (plumes), undergo physico-chemical transfor mations resulting in the formation of iberulites. Here we report a microscopy research study that analyzes th e biological nanostructures associated to iberulites. A prior selection of iberulite samples was carried out using optical microscopy. Because the material forming iberulites comes from the neighbouring aerosols, their biological constituents should be, a priori, qualitatively similar. However the processes undergone by the iberulites, and their properties, can cause some differences resulting from the role played by these microenvironments as a phys ical support that facilit ates microbial survival and spreading. Dust plumes can have high relative concentrations of remains of composited organisms (plants and diverse microorgani sms) which signify additional loads of viable, yet dormant, biological specimens (bacterial and f ungal spores, algal cysts, plant pollen grains) which move with th ese plumes. These studies, together with future metagenomic data, wi ll improve our knowledge of th e biodiversity of microbial communities integrated in aerolites, a particular class of mi croenvironments with global ecological projection.

Firstly, the parameters (including <b>magnification</b> <b>screen</b> size, luminance contrast, and resolution) of PELVAs were assessed. <b>Magnification</b> and <b>screen</b> size were also compared with the manufacturers’ data. Secondly, data (age, gender, ocular condition, visual acuity, living situation, registration of visual impairment, type of low vision aid prescribed) from 6, 668 patients who attended the Low Vision Service for Wales were analyzed to assess the clinicians’ prescribing patterns for PELVAs. Thirdly, reading frequency and duration, and self-reported effectiveness of PELVAs and optical low vision aids for patients with visual impairment were evaluated by using a telephone interview based upon the Manchester Low Vision Questionnaire. Finally, reading speed was measured for normally sighted subjects with simulated visual impairment who used a PELVA and an optical low vision aid. The factors that could predict reading speed were investigated. PELVAs enhanced the luminance contrast of high and low contrast letters which may be beneficial for patients with contrast reduction, for example due to cataracts.

40|$|The World Health Organization (WHO) {{estimates}} at 285 {{million the}} number of people affected by visual deficiencies, among which 39 millions are totally blind. In our modern society saturated with visual media tools and applications (images, videos, web pages, etc.), accessing visual information becomes a central need for all kinds of tasks and users, including the visually impaired. In this context, various adapted tools of assistance (screen readers, Braille terminals, <b>screen</b> <b>magnification,</b> etc.), have been increasingly helping persons suffering from a visual incapacity to access and manipulate information. While effective with textual contents, nonetheless, existing solutions remain very limited when it comes to accessing and understanding visual contents.

40|$|We {{compared}} {{three in}} situ hybridization (ISH) methods for their applicability and sensitivity in detecting human papillomavirus (HPV) in 61 cases (1 Grade 1, 18 Grade 2, 42 Grade 3) of routinely processed squamous cell cervical carcinoma. A commercially available biotinylated probe for HPV- 16 / 18 was applied to serial sections and detected by conventional streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase ISH, streptavidin-Nanogold-silver ISH, and catalyzed reporter deposition (CARD) -Nanogold-gold ISH. The latter method involved signal amplification by peroxidase-catalyzed deposition of biotinylated tyramides at the hybridization sites, followed by detection of accumulated biotin by streptavidin-Nanogold made visible by autometallography. The HPV- 16 / 18 detection rates for the three methods were 39. 3, 44. 3, and 65. 6 %, respectively. In all of the three ISH methods, a punctate staining pattern (single or multiple intranuclear spots of variable size), presumably indicating viral integration, was highly predominant among the positive cases. Two of the cases identified as positive by streptavidin- biotin-peroxidase ISH were rated negative with streptavidin-Nanogold-silver ISH, whereas six cases that were clearly negative with streptavidin-biotin- peroxidase ISH became positively stained with streptavidin-Nanogold ISH. All of these discordant cases were positive by the highly sensitive CARD Nanogold-gold ISH. In addition, the high detection sensitivity of CARD- Nanogold-gold ISH was confirmed by its ability to detect single copies of HPV- 16 in SiHa cells. In general, {{we found that the}} intense black reaction product from Nanogold autometallography gave superior contrast to that obtained with the peroxidase system. After tyramide signal amplification, the staining was so clearly visible that preparations could be readily <b>screened</b> under low <b>magnification.</b> Our findings precisely demonstrated the need for improved sensitivity in the in situ detection of HPV.

40|$|If a {{human being}} gets 75 % of {{information}} by sight (Vibur 2005), {{it does not mean}} that visually impaired people, who use primarily hearing for getting information, that they prefer only radio, which is the only audio channel, because nowadays technology gives a possibility to transfer visual texts into audio form. For example blind people can listen to the news and books by synthetic speech and <b>screen</b> <b>magnification.</b> They can also read books and newspapers from audio files, like from cassettes and CD-s. And in the future there should be only CD-s. Thesis „The Media Use of Visually Impaired People” shows that visually impaired people can use every media channel, if it is converted into suitable form. The choice of channels depends first of all on the people themselves. Next they choose the useful aids, from magnifying glass and television-spectacles till the computer with Braille’ screen. The choice of the aids depends on the rate of disability, and also on activity, interest and the skills of {{a human being}}. For example most of the visually impaired people does not know Braille’ and that is why they do not need the aids, which help them to read and write in Braille’ system. And so there is no need for printing Braille’ books, which is the reason why the number of books are decreasing. The ability to read and write in Braille’ system decrease despite of the fact that this system and the inventor of this style Louis Braille is very famous in the history of blind people and even there had been celebrations of the Braille’ day in Estonia in last years. Reading the books is very popular, even though not in Braille’, because sound writing makes much easier to reach different information. Most of audio books and audio journalism (which mostly concerns the life of visually impaired people) are made in the Library of Estonian Blind People. The range of the editions is much smaller compared with the state library, but it is still very important place for mediating information between visually impaired people. If most of the visually impaired people are unemployed, they have plenty of spare time to read books. Most of all they read fiction. In thesis I divided visually impaired people to partially sighted and blind people. On the assumption of empirical part of thesis or to say for the media analyse of visually impaired people I divided them into three groups: partially sighted, people who had lost their sight in later life and people born blind. For analyse I interviewed the medium group – nine people who had lost their sight in later life. In addition I interviewed six experts to explain the media use of visually impaired people. In sampling there were many young people, that is why it appeared that nowadays internet as a medium plays enormous role and the messages of it are used very often. But there is a problem with different media messages of internet, so that getting information is quite complicated for blind people, because there is a lot of odd information on the websites. Despite of the difficulties in websites you can get higher education only when you have computer and internet connection. In summary if visually impaired people have an opportunity and facilities to use all media channels, it gives them equal opportunities to take part in social life. This helps them to integrate in the community, which gives so stronger basis of the development of the society...|$|E
