40|$|The {{purpose of}} this chapter is to present a {{critique}} of the fundamental ideas of neoliberal university management, where the culture of control and the culture of evidence play key roles. It is based on the concepts of new public management as applied to universities, which have been reflected on in a critical management studies stream and other radical trends in social sciences. This chapter puts forward a question about the effectiveness of applied neoliberal management solutions and the legitimacy of their criticism under the radical trend in management, pedagogy and social sciences. Along with making public goods, such as health care, welfare and higher education, accessible to the general public in the twentieth century, the problem of growing costs of such <b>services</b> <b>emerged</b> <b>as</b> <b>well...</b>|$|R

This paper provides a security to the vehicle through the embedded system. This system is purely based on microcontroller. This paper enables that when the vehicle key is turned on, the microcontroller automatically {{send a message to}} the vehicle owner mobile or to the mobile which is registered on vehicle buying. If the person may know about it, he will {{send a message to the}} mobile number which is present at the GSM module interfaced with the microcontroller. When the GSM module gets a message it activates the GPS module an send an message to the owner where the vehicle present now.
