40|$|There is {{widespread}} acknowledgement in the Republic of South Africa that bituminous pavement cracks are formed {{either from the}} top down or from the bottom up. The top open cracks normally are associated with environmental conditions such as heat, cold thermal movements, etc. It is also caused by overloaded tyre contact stresses, which exceed the limiting strain offered by the asphalt materials. These cracks are normally wide open and crack sealing from the top is possible and relatively easy. This paper describes the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>method</b> (materials, machine and procedures) for sealing top down cracks. The top closed crack caused by fatigue, structural inadequacies etc., are normally witnessed as fine cracks, too narrow to be sealed from the top. Because of the tightness of the bottom up cracks, they are invariably treated by applying a sheet type sealant system. The normally used sealant sheets comprise either a bitumen impregnated geofabric, geogrids, patented sealant sheets, chip and spray constructions or asphalt overlays. In the RSA use is made of chip and sprays to seal the entire width of roads which then acts as a stress absorbing membrane (SAM).

40|$|MArt et Scien (Urban and Regional Planning), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 South Africa is {{plagued with}} a {{staggering}} housing backlog (estimated at approximately 2. 1 million units at present) due, in part, {{to the poor}} planning principles advocated by the Apartheid regime. Concerted efforts {{were made by the}} newly elected government since 1994 to provide houses for the urban poor who were previously disadvantaged. As such, a subsidised housing scheme in South Africa was introduced as a method to provide adequate housing to citizens who could not afford to do so themselves. However, despite the construction of approximately 3 million dwellings over the past 19 years, the backlog today is larger than the initial backlog experienced in 1994. Two questions were therefore raised in this research: 1) Whether the current approach to subsidised housing provision is sustainable, given the socio-economic conditions present in South African cities and 2) Which planning principles could be applied with regards to subsidised housing in order to ensure the development of sustainable human settlements. In order to address these issues, research regarding sustainable human settlements, and the South African context in terms of housing provision, was done {{in the form of a}} literature review and empirical study. The literature reviewed shed light on (a) urban models, (b) the elements of sustainable human settlements, (c) policies and legislation relating to subsidised housing provision in South Africa and (d) the criticisms against the South African policies and the current method of subsidised housing provision in South Africa. Information gained during the literature review phase was used to compile a set of criteria by which housing provision for the urban poor could be evaluated. This evaluation took the form of an empirical study which consisted of structured questionnaires and interviews, and a comparative analysis of international and local pilot studies. The following subsidised housing projects were scrutinised to establish best practices that may be applied to the South African context: * Bairro Carioca and Taroni Condiminiums in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, * Haram City in October 6 City, Egypt, * Cosmo City, South Africa, * Community Residential Units in Potchefstroom, South Africa, and * Reconstruction and Development Program Units in Potchefstroom, South Africa. Through the critical evaluation of the above mentioned projects, it became clear that the typical <b>South</b> <b>African</b> <b>method</b> of subsidised housing provision, in which beneficiaries receive a loose standing dwelling house on a single erf, is in fact unsustainable, and that this approach is not facilitating the formation of sustainable human settlements. Alternative methods of housing delivery that can be implemented in the South African context were identified and led to the formulation of planning related recommendations in terms of sustainable subsidised housing provision, focussing on (1) increased densities, (2) improved location and (3) providing a range of household types. Mention was also made of non-planning related recommendations such as (4) alternative services delivery, (5) including different forms of tenure and (6) increasing financial responsibility.

40|$|Introduction. The {{association}} between perceived built environmental attributes and hypertension among adults has received little attention in an African context. We investigated the {{association between}} the perceived built environment and prevalent hypertension in adult <b>South</b> <b>Africans.</b> <b>Method.</b> A cross-sectional study was conducted using 2008 - 2009 Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology data among <b>South</b> <b>African</b> (n= 671) adults aged ≥ 35 years. Perceived built environment was assessed using the neighborhood environment walkability scale questionnaire. Prevalent {{hypertension was defined as}} previously diagnosed by a physician, screen-detected hypertension as ≥ 140 / 90 [*]mmHg, and a combination of both as any hypertension. Logistic regressions were applied for analyses. Results. In crude logistic regressions, self-reported hypertension was associated with land use mix-diversity, street connectivity, infrastructure for walking/cycling, aesthetics, traffic, and crime. In adjusted model, land use mix-diversity was significantly associated with self-reported hypertension. In similar multivariable models, the direction and magnitude of the effects were mostly similar to the outcomes of “screen-detected hypertension” which was further predicted by perceived lack of safety from traffic. Conclusion. Perceived built environment attributes were significantly associated with hypertension. This has relevance to population-based approaches to hypertension prevention and control...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Maternal {{mortality}} in South Africa is rising, and heart conditions currently account for 41 per cent of indirect causes of deaths. Little {{is known about}} the burden of heart disease in pregnant <b>South</b> <b>Africans.</b> <b>Methods</b> We systematically reviewed the contemporary epidemiology and peripartum outcomes of heart disease in <b>South</b> <b>African</b> women attending antenatal care. Searches were performed in PubMed, ISI Web of Science, the EBSCO Africa-Wide database, the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> Union Catalogue, and the Current and Completed Research database (South Africa). References of included articles were also hand-searched. Studies reporting epidemiologic data on antenatal heart disease in South Africa were included. Data on morbidity and mortality were also collected. Results Seven studies were included in the systematic review. The prevalence of heart disease ranged from 123 to 943 per 100, 000 deliveries, with a median prevalence of 616 per 100, 000. Rheumatic valvular lesions were the commonest abnormalities, although cardiomyopathies were disproportionately high in comparison with other developing countries. Peripartum case-fatality rates were as high as 9. 5 per cent in areas with limited access to care. The most frequent complications were pulmonary oedema, thromboembolism, and major bleeding with warfarin use. Perinatal mortality ranged from 8. 9 to 23. 8 per cent, whilst mitral lesions were associated with low birth weight. Meta-analysis could not be performed due to clinical and statistical heterogeneity of the included studies. Conclusion Approximately 0. 6 per cent of pregnant <b>South</b> <b>Africans</b> have pre-existing cardiac abnormalities, with rheumatic lesions being the commonest. Maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality continue to be very high. We conclude this review by summarising limitations of the current literature and recommending standard reporting criteria for future reports. </p...|$|R

40|$|Purpose Primary Open Angle Glaucoma (POAG) is an {{important}} cause of irreversible visual loss in South Africa. POAG is asymptomatic, yet early detection and treatment can prevent visual loss. POAG has a genetic component, and identifying genetic risk factors could facilitate early detection as well as elucidate pathogenic mechanisms of the disease. POAG {{is more common in}} populations of African descent, but has been understudied in the context of POAG genetic risk factors in these populations. The purpose of this research was to identify genetic risk factors for POAG in black <b>South</b> <b>Africans.</b> <b>Methods</b> Self-identified black <b>South</b> <b>African</b> POAG patients and unaffected control participants were enrolled at St John Eye Hospital in Soweto. The study population was evaluated in case-control association studies for genetic risk factors in the following genomic regions: CDKN 2 B/CDKN 2 BAS- 1, MYOC, TMCO 1, CAV 1 /CAV 2, CYP 1 B 1, WDR 36, COL 1 A 1, COL 1 A 2, COL 5 A 1, COL 8 A 2, ZNF 469, SIX 1 /SIX 6, ATOH 7 and the chromosome 2 p 16 locus. The study was powered to detect moderate-sized genetic effects. Family members of participants identified with potentially pathogenic mutations in MYOC were counselled, screened for the mutations and clinically screened for glaucoma. Genotyping data from SNPs in TMCO 1, CAV 1 /CAV 2, CDKN 2 BAS- 1 and SIX 1 /SIX 6 that had also been genotyped in a West African and an African American population were compared with the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> data and the three datasets were combined to create a larger sample of individuals of African descent for association analyses.

We {{determined}} {{metabolic syndrome}} (MetS) prevalence and assessed the agreement between different diagnostic criteria in HIV-infected <b>South</b> <b>Africans.</b> <b>Method.</b> A random sample included 748 HIV-infected adult patients (79 % women) across 17 HIV healthcare {{facilities in the}} Western Cape Province. MetS was defined using the Joint Interim Statement (JIS 2009), International Diabetes Federation (IDF 2005), and Adult Treatment Panel III (ATPIII 2005) criteria. Results. Median values were 38 years (age), 5 years (diagnosed HIV duration), and 392 cells/mm 3 (CD 4 count), and 93 % {{of the participants were}} on antiretroviral therapy (ART). MetS prevalence was 28. 2 % (95 %CI: 25 – 31. 4), 26. 5 % (23. 3 – 29. 6), and 24. 1 % (21 – 27. 1) by the JIS, IDF, and ATPIII 2005 criteria, respectively. Prevalence was always higher in women than in men (all p< 0. 001), in participants with longer duration of diagnosed HIV (all p≤ 0. 003), and in ART users not receiving 1 st-line regimens (all p≤ 0. 039). The agreement among the three criteria was very good overall and in most subgroups (all kappa≥ 0. 81). Conclusions. The three most popular diagnostic criteria yielded similarly high MetS prevalence in this relatively young population receiving care for HIV infection.

40|$|Introduction The {{association}} of the HLA shared epitope with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in black <b>South</b> <b>Africans</b> is well established. The aims of the thesis were to identify non-HLA risk loci associated with RA using the Immunochip array and to assess the {{association of}} specific amino acids at specific positions of the DRB 1 locus with the risk for developing RA in black <b>South</b> <b>Africans.</b> <b>Methods</b> Ethnically and geographically matched RA cases (n= 435) and controls (n= 463) were genotyped using the Immunochip array which has 196 000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with 12 autoimmune diseases. After quality control, 103 700 SNPs were tested for association in 263 cases and 374 controls. For the amino acid study, DNA sequencing of exon 2 of the DRB 1 locus {{was performed on the}} seropositive cases (n= 261) using the Allele SEQR HLA-DRB 1 (Abbot) assay and four digit HLA typing was assigned using the Assign software (Conexio Genomics). The amino acid sequences were inferred from the called allele type. Association testing and conditional analysis were performed. Results A total of 72 HLA SNPs reached statistical significance (p< 5 x 10 - 8) of which 71 SNPs locate to the HLA-DR or DQ genes or to the intergenic region between these two genes. Specifically, 4 SNPs in the intergenic region between HLA-DRB 1 and HLA-DQA 1 (rs 3104413, OR= 3. 88, p= 5. 49 x 10 - 21; rs 3129769, OR= 3. 91, p= 4. 60 x 10 - 21; rs 6931277, OR= 3. 97, p= 1. 03 x 10 - 21; rs 9272353, OR= 4. 1, p= 3. 01 x 10 - 21) were highly associated. Ten non-HLA SNPs on chromosome 6 reached significance of which 7 SNPs locate to the intergenic region between BTNL 2 and HLA-DRA and confer protection. Four “SNPs” on chromosome 1 locating to a copy number variant region of the intergenic region between PLD 5 and LOC 400723 were significantly associated with RA in this study (rs 2809867, OR= 0. 33, p= 5. 01 x 10 - 08; rs 12738883, OR= 0. 33, p= 3. 98 x 10 - 08; rs 78352781, OR= 0. 33, p= 3. 98 x 10 - 08; rs 12739315, OR= 0. 33, p= 3. 98 x 10 - 08) and showed an even stronger association with the rheumatoid factor positive subgroup. Valine at amino acid position 11 of DRB 1 demonstrated the strongest associated with RA (OR= 5. 1 (3. 7, 7. 0), p= 1. 63 x 10 - 27) and serine at this position was protective (OR= 0. 4 (0. 3, 0. 5), p= 2. 46 x 10 - 16). Interestingly, the frequency of valine in black <b>South</b> <b>African</b> RA cases was much lower than in Caucasians with RA. Using principal component analysis, black <b>South</b> <b>Africans</b> were found to be genetically distinct from west and east African populations. Conclusion This study demonstrated both similarities and differences in the risk for RA between Caucasians and black <b>South</b> <b>Africans.</b> Similar to Caucasians, the HLA region confers the strongest genetic risk for RA in black <b>South</b> <b>Africans.</b> More specifically, valine at position 11 of DRB 1 confers the strongest risk for RA in black <b>South</b> <b>Africans</b> and serine confers protection. Four novel non-HLA RA-associated SNPs in the intergenic region between LOC 400723 and PLD 5 were identified. Variants of the PTPN 22 gene, although strongly associated with RA in Caucasians, are not associated with RA in this population. Since this population is genetically distinct, the findings need to be independently validated in other African populations...|$|R

The objectives {{of this study were}} to (i) identify the HPV types not detected by commercial genotyping kits present in a cervical specimen from an HIV positive <b>South</b> <b>African</b> woman using next generation sequencing, and (ii) determine if these types were prevalent in a cohort of HIV-infected <b>South</b> <b>African</b> women. 				 				 					 						<b>Methods</b> 					Total DNA was isolated from 109 cervical specimens from <b>South</b> <b>African</b> HIV&# 8201;+&# 8201;women. A specimen within this cohort representing a complex multiple HPV infection, with 12 HPV genotypes detected by the Roche Linear Array HPV genotyping (LA) kit, was selected for next generation sequencing analysis. All HPV types present in this cervical specimen were identified by Illumina sequencing of the extracted DNA following rolling circle amplification. The prevalence of the HPV types identified by sequencing, but not included in the Roche LA, was then determined in the 109 HIV positive <b>South</b> <b>African</b> women by type-specific PCR. 				 				 					 						Results 					Illumina sequencing identified a total of 16 HPV genotypes in the selected specimen, with four genotypes (HPV- 30, 74, 86 and 90) not included in the commercial kit. The prevalence&# 8217;s of HPV- 30, 74, 86 and 90 in 109 HIV positive <b>South</b> <b>African</b> women were found to be 14. 6 %, 12. 8 %, 4. 6 % and 8. 3 % respectively. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					Our results indicate that there are HPV types, with substantial prevalence, in HIV positive women not being detected in molecular epidemiology studies using commercial kits. The significance of these types in relation to cervical disease remains to be investigated. Publishers' Versio...|$|R
40|$|Unbound {{aggregate}} base layers in a quarry {{haul road}} in Georgia were characterized using embedded sensors and in-situ seismic testing. Two {{sections of the}} road were constructed as inverted pavements, one using a <b>South</b> <b>African</b> Roads Board <b>method</b> and the other using a conventional Georgia Department of Transportation method. A third was constructed using a traditional method. Horizontally propagating compression and shear waves were measured under varying loading conditions to determine the stiffnesses. It {{was found that the}} Georgia section was as good as the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> Section. Surprisingly, the traditional section was found to be somewhat stiffer than the other sections. This higher stiffness is thought to be due to a prolonged period of compaction prior to construction of the unbound aggregate base layer. Additionally, the negative pore-water pressures in the partially saturated granular base {{had a significant impact on}} the stiffness of the UAB layer, especially under small load levels...|$|R
40|$|A lot of {{research}} has been done to determine the size of airports. This includes the determination of airport capacity, runway capacity, check-in capacity and flight scheduling. Since the terminal buildings are the most expensive facilities, it can determine whether an airport is a financial feasible project or not. The main focus of this study will thus be on terminal buildings and their layout. This document describes different methods to determine the size of passenger terminals, none of these have been tested for <b>South</b> <b>African</b> use. These <b>methods</b> will have to be tested and the student will have to determine which methods or techniques are better to use. South Africa is hosting the soccer world cup in 2010. Virtual Buro is a subcontractor to get <b>South</b> <b>African</b> airports ready for this big event. They asked the student to analyse these methods and help get <b>South</b> <b>African</b> airports up to international standards. This will be accomplished by looking at passenger flow, the layout of passenger terminal buildings, the different ways of determining capacity and Occupational Health and Safety regulations.

40|$|OBJECTIVE : This study {{aimed to}} {{describe}} the prevalence and characteristics of hearing loss in school-aged children in an urban <b>South</b> <b>African</b> population. <b>METHOD</b> : Children from grade one to three from five schools in the Gauteng Province of South Africa formed a representative sample for this study. All children underwent otoscopic examinations, tympanometry and pure tone screening (25 dB HL at 1, 2 and 4 kHz). Children who failed the screening test and 5 % of those who passed the screening test underwent diagnostic audiometry. RESULTS : A total of 1070 children were screened. Otoscopic examinations revealed that a total of 6. 6 % ears had cerumen and 7. 5 % of ears presented with a type-B tympanogram. 24 children (12 male, 12 female) were diagnosed with hearing loss. The overall prevalence of hearing loss was 2. 2 % with Caucasian children being 2. 9 times more (95 % confidence interval, 1. 2 – 6. 9) {{likely to have a}} hearing loss than African children. CONCLUSION : Hearing loss prevalence in urban <b>South</b> <b>African</b> school-aged children suggest that many children (2. 2 %) are in need of some form of follow-up services, most for medical intervention (1. 2 %) with a smaller population requiring audiological intervention (0. 4 %).

40|$|Background We {{evaluated}} the diagnostic {{accuracy of the}} urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) antigen detec-tion assay (Clearview TB-ELISA) to screen for tuberculosis in a <b>South</b> <b>African</b> correctional facility. <b>Methods</b> Between September 2009 and October 2010, male offenders were screened for tuberculo-sis (symptoms, chest radiograph, two spot sputum specimens for microscopy and culture), and urine tested for LAM. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of LAM were calculat-ed using definite and probable tuberculosis combined as our gold standard. Findings 33 / 871 (3. 8 %) participants (26 % HIV-positive) had tuberculosis. Amongst HIV-positive vs. HIV-negative offenders the sensitivity and specificity of LAM was 7. 1 % vs. 0 % and 98. 5 % vs. 99. 8 % respectively.

40|$|Abstract Background Studies {{conducted}} {{in developed countries}} using economic models show that individual- and household- level variables are important determinants of health insurance ownership. There is however a dearth of such studies in sub-Saharan Africa. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine the relationship between health insurance ownership and the demographic, economic and educational characteristics of <b>South</b> <b>African</b> women. <b>Methods</b> The analysis was based on data from a cross-sectional national household sample derived from the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> Health Inequalities Survey (SANHIS). The study subjects consisted of 3, 489 women, aged between 16 and 64 years. It was a non-interventional, qualitative response econometric study. The outcome measure was the probability of a respondent's ownership of a health insurance policy. Results The χ 2 test for goodness of fit indicated satisfactory prediction of the estimated logit model. The coefficients of the covariates for area of residence, income, education, environment rating, age, smoking and marital status were positive, and all statistically significant at p ≤ 0. 05. Women who had standard 10 education and above (secondary), high incomes and lived in affluent provinces and permanent accommodations, had a higher likelihood of being insured. Conclusion Poverty reduction programmes aimed at increasing women's incomes in poor provinces; improving living environment (e. g. potable water supplies, sanitation, electricity and housing) for women in urban informal settlements; enhancing women's access to education; reducing unemployment among women; and increasing effective coverage of family planning services, will empower <b>South</b> <b>African</b> women to reach a higher standard of living and in doing so increase their economic access to health insurance policies and the associated health services. </p...|$|R
40|$|Although third molar removal {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{frequently}} undertaken surgical procedures, there is little information on the causes and patterns of impacted third molars in various population groups. Prophylactic removal of disease free third molars (M 3 s) is highly controversial, as is the risk of post-operative complications. Aims and Objectives The aims and objectives of this study were: To determine and compare the frequency, angulations, depth and distance of impacted M 3 s in black and Indian <b>South</b> <b>Africans.</b> Materials and <b>methods</b> One thousand and six hundred panoral radiographs of black and Indian <b>South</b> <b>Africans</b> were collected from a private Maxillo-facial practice in Durban.

40|$|Background. As part of {{a larger}} {{dermatological}} investigation undertaken in 1999 - 2001 involving the Department of Dermatology, Groote Schuur Hospital (Cape Town, South Africa) and Nottingham University (UK), household pesticide use was investigated among Xhosa-speaking families living in three areas in South Africa (a rural area, an urban township and an informal settlement). Objectives. The aim was to characterise pesticide use patterns and potential exposures through skin absorption, ingestion and inhalation for this group of <b>South</b> <b>African</b> children. <b>Methods.</b> A standardised questionnaire, which included a section investigating household pesticide use, was administered by four trained fieldworkers to the parents/ guardians of the 740 children (25 %) aged between 3 and 11 years identified as having atopic dermatitis either by clinical examination or according to the UK criteria (rural N= 387, urban N= 292, informal N= 61). Results. Of the children with atopic dermatitis, 539 (73 %) had been exposed to household pesticides. Most childhood exposure (89 %) occurred in the informal settlements, followed by 78 % in the urban area and 63 % in the rural area. Conclusions. This research highlighted considerable home environment pesticide exposure of <b>South</b> <b>African</b> children in lower socio-economic groups in rural, urban and informal areas. As children are particularly vulnerable to the short- and long-term health effects of pesticide exposure, further indepth investigation is needed to ascertain and document the health effects associated with such exposure in the home...|$|R
40|$|Background. Intussusception is {{a common}} {{gastrointestinal}} emergency in children and {{appears to have a}} somewhat different clinical spectrum in developing countries. Its etiology is still unclear, but a link to infective agents and viruses has been highlighted. This study aimed to assess the clinical spectrum and prevalence of intussusception in children from the diverse <b>South</b> <b>African</b> population. <b>Methods.</b> Retrospective data were obtained from 9 participating pediatric referral units on the occurrence of intussusception in <b>South</b> <b>African</b> children (! 14 years old) during a 6 -year period (1998 – 2003). Results were correlated with national population statistics. Intussusception was anatomically classified into ileoileal, ileocolic, and colocolic types. The clinical features, management, outcome, and possible causes were examined. Results. We reviewed the occurrence and clinical spectrum of intussusception in 423 children (age, 0 – 14 years) presenting with acute intussusception to 9 pediatric surgical centers. The mean duration of symptoms was 1. 5 days, but a delayed presentation was common (median delay, 2. 3 days). Intussusception occurred throughout the year, with a peak in the summer months. The majority of patients (89 %) were! 2 years old, and 78 % presented at age 3 – 18 months of age. Crude population estimates indicate an occurrence of 1 case per 3123 population! 2 years old. Only 11 % of patients presented after 2 years of age, and the age at presentation was significantly lower () in black African patients. All ethnic groups were affected.

40|$|Aims To {{determine}} the predictive utility of polygenic risk scores of common variants associated with {{type 2 diabetes}} derived from the European and Asian ethnicities among a black <b>South</b> <b>African</b> population. <b>Method</b> Our study was a case-control study nested within the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiological (PURE) study of 178 male and female cases, matched for age and gender with 178 controls. Four types of genetic risk scores (GRS) were developed from 66 selected SNPs. These comprised of beta cell related variants (GRSb), variants which had significant associations with T 2 D in our study (GRSn), variants from the trans-ethnic meta-analysis (GRStrans) and all the 66 selected SNPs (GRSt). Results Of the GRS’s, only GRSn was associated with increased risk of T 2 D as indicated by an OR (95 CI) of 1. 21 (1. 02 – 1. 43) p-value = 0. 015. Stratified analysis of age and BMI, indicated the GRSn to be significantly associated with T 2 D among the non-obese and participants less than 50 years. The area under the ROC of the T 2 D risk factors only was 0. 652 (p value < 0. 001) and {{with the addition of}} GRSn it was 0. 665 (p value < 0. 001). Conclusions The GRS of European and Asian derived variants have limited clinical utility in the black <b>South</b> <b>African</b> population.

40|$|Objective. To {{determine}} whether the - 308 TNF-α promoter polymorphism is associated with markers of HIV progression in the <b>South</b> <b>African</b> population. <b>Methods.</b> Polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism was used to detect the - 308 TNF-α polymorphism in 75 patients and 76 healthy controls. Serum TNF-α concentrations were measured using ELISA in each cohort. CD 4 + T cell apoptosis and HIV- 1 RNA viral load were determined using Annexin-V-FITC assay and Nuclisens Easy Q HIV- 1 assay respectively. CD 4 + T cell counts were measured flow cytometrically. Results. The frequency of - 308 G allele was similar in the HIV- 1 and control cohorts. The - 308 GG genotype was associated with lower TNF-α concentrations and markers of increased HIV progression indicated by higher TH lymphocyte apoptosis, lower TH lymphocyte count and higher plasma viral load, irrespective of treatment. Conclusion. The presence of the TNF-α - 308 G allele in HIV- 1 patients {{may be associated with}} increased risk of HIV- 1 progression.

40|$|Objective To {{evaluate}} four paediatric weight {{estimation methods}} (APLS, Luscombe and Owens, Best Guess and Broselow tape) {{in order to}} determine which are accurate for weight estimation in <b>South</b> <b>African</b> children. <b>Method</b> From a database of 2832 children aged 1 e 10 years seen at Red Cross Hospital in Cape Town, measured weight was compared to estimated weights from all four methods. Results APLS formula and the Broselow Tape showed the best correlation with measured weight. Mean error was 3. 3 % for APLS (for 1 e 10 -year olds) and 0. 9 % for Broselow tape (children < 145 cm length and < 35 kg). Both the Best Guess and Luscombe and Owens formulae tended to overestimate weight (15. 4 % and 12. 4 %, respectively). Conclusion The Broselow tape and APLS estimation methods are most accurate in estimating weight in the Western Cape paediatric population, even though they have a small tendency to underestimate weight. Clinicians need to bear in mind that none of the formulae are infallible and constant reassessment and clinical judgement should be used, as well as a measured weight as soon as possible in an emergency situation...|$|R
