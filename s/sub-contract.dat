5|$|To {{fill the}} demand for other aircraft, {{especially}} smaller ones like the de Havilland Mosquito, the Air Ministry began looking at US manufacturers to supply the bombsight. Frederic Blin Vose of Sperry Gyroscope {{expressed an interest in}} the design and felt he could adapt the Mk. XIV to US production methods and have it in mass production rapidly. Sperry arranged for AC Spark Plug to take over manufacture, initially on a <b>sub-contract</b> basis and later for direct sales to the UK.|$|E
5|$|Perkin-Elmer {{intended}} to use custom-built and extremely sophisticated computer-controlled polishing machines to grind the mirror to the required shape. However, in case their cutting-edge technology ran into difficulties, NASA demanded that PE <b>sub-contract</b> to Kodak to construct a back-up mirror using traditional mirror-polishing techniques. (The team of Kodak and Itek also bid on the original mirror polishing work. Their bid called for the two companies to double-check each other's work, which would have almost certainly caught the polishing error that later caused such problems.) The Kodak mirror is now on permanent display at the National Air and Space Museum. An Itek mirror built {{as part of the}} effort is now used in the 2.4m telescope at the Magdalena Ridge Observatory.|$|E

40|$|The present Master's thesis aims {{to clarify}} the legal notion of <b>sub-contracting,</b> both in civil and common law, through {{a study of the}} subject as regards French and Quebec law, on the one hand, and {{according}} to the laws in force in England, in the Canadian common law provinces and in the United States, on the other hand. To this end we have described the development process of <b>sub-contracting</b> and worked out a typology of this notion. Subsequently, we have shown how the legal systems under study have defined <b>sub-contracting,</b> and in which manner their definitions of <b>sub-contracting</b> differ from those given by economists. We have also looked closely at the legal qualification of the process of <b>sub-contracting</b> and the contracts involved, insisting on certain consequences of the qualifications retained. Finally, we have distinguished <b>sub-contracting</b> from other related notions...|$|R

25|$|In 1989, Burns {{was hired}} to kill a jumper horse named Streetwise. This horse was owned by Donna Brown, the ex-wife of former U.S. Olympic rider Buddy Brown, {{who had once been}} a trainer at Paul Valliere's farm in Rhode Island. Because the animal had already {{suffered}} from colic and thus could not be insured against that disease, electrocution was ruled out as a method of murder. Donna Brown insisted that Burns break the animal's leg and make it look like an accident so that the horse would have to be put down by a vet. Burns decided to <b>sub-contract</b> the deed to a man named Harlow Arlie, who was willing to cripple the horse with a crowbar.|$|E

25|$|In 1951, Henry J. Kaiser {{was awarded}} a {{contract}} to assemble additional C-119s at the Kaiser-Frazer automotive factory located in the former B-24 plant at Willow Run Airport in Belleville, Michigan. Initially, the Kaiser-built C-119F differed from the Fairchild aircraft {{by the use of}} Wright R-3350-85 Duplex Cyclone engines in place of Fairchild's use of the Pratt & Whitney R-4360 Wasp Major radial engine. Kaiser built 71 C-119s at Willow Run in 1952 and 1953 (AF Ser. No. 51-8098 to 51-8168) before converting the factory for a planned production of the Chase C-123 that never eventuated. The Kaiser <b>sub-contract</b> was frowned upon by Fairchild, and efforts were made through political channels to stop Kaiser's production, which may have proven successful. Following Kaiser's termination of C-119 production the contract for the C-123 was instead awarded to Fairchild. Most Kaiser-built aircraft were issued to the U.S. Marine Corps as R4Qs, with several later turned over to the South Vietnamese air force in the 1970s.|$|E

30|$|It is {{important}} to note, however, {{that the question of}} whether these additional management tasks needed for <b>sub-contracting</b> are justified and whether <b>sub-contracting</b> is overall cost-effective has not been answered conclusively yet.

However, these evaluations have only been made in an early stage of private service delivery. Implementing an effective <b>sub-contracting</b> system for employment services is a learning process aimed at reaping the expected gains from better incentives as well as more competition and choice. This becomes a challenge in developing countries as the private sector supply of employment services might, at least initially, not be sufficient or of high quality.|$|R
