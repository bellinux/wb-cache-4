5|$|According to Malhotra, most of {{the action}} stunts in the film were shot by Roshan and Dutt themselves, while body doubles were used to film a few scenes. Several {{accidents}} {{took place during the}} filming of Agneepath. Priyanka Chopra's lehenga caught fire, while <b>shooting</b> <b>for</b> an elaborate Ganpati festival song. Hrithik Roshan too scalded his hands while <b>shooting</b> <b>for</b> the same scene. Roshan also suffered from an eye injury during the shoot of a song, when holi colours were flung into his eyes by some junior artists. In October, Roshan suffered from a major back injury while lifting a man weighing 110 kilograms, which was a part of an elaborate action sequence. Shooting was stalled for some time following the incident, while Roshan recuperated in a hospital.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, {{the wood}} pigeon is {{commonly}} shot {{as a game}} bird, while rock pigeons were originally domesticated as a food species, and many breeds were developed for their meat-bearing qualities. The extinction of the passenger pigeon in North America was at least partly due to <b>shooting</b> <b>for</b> use as food. Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management contains recipes for roast pigeon and pigeon pie, a popular, inexpensive food in Victorian industrial Britain.|$|E

5|$|In July 2008, Christian Bale was {{filming a}} scene in New Mexico for the film Terminator Salvation with actress Bryce Dallas Howard. The film's {{director}} of photography, Shane Hurlbut, walked into Bale's line of sight, and the actor proceeded to yell obscenities at Hurlbut. Bale said he would quit the film if Hurlbut repeated the error and was not subsequently fired. Hurlbut responded calmly and apologized several times to Bale, and continued <b>shooting</b> <b>for</b> seven hours after the incident.|$|E

5|$|Like other bows, {{they lost}} {{importance}} {{with the introduction}} and increasing accuracy of guns. In some areas composite bows were still used and were further developed for leisure purposes. Later Turkish bows are specialized for flight archery (<b>shooting</b> <b>for</b> distance). Composite bows are still made and used in Korea and in China, and the tradition has been revived elsewhere. Modern replicas are available, often made with fiberglass bellies and backs with a natural or man-made core.|$|E

5|$|<b>Shooting</b> <b>for</b> The Curse of the Black Pearl {{began on}} October 9, 2002 and wrapped by March 7, 2003. Before its release, many {{executives}} and journalists had expected {{the film to}} flop, as the pirate genre had not been successful for years, the film {{was based on a}} theme-park ride, and Depp rarely made a big film. However, The Curse of the Black Pearl became both a critical and commercial success.|$|E
5|$|Cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond said that, {{during the}} time of <b>shooting</b> <b>for</b> the film, Spielberg got more ideas by {{watching}} movies every night which in turn extended the production schedule because he was continually adding new scenes to be filmed. Zsigmond previously turned down the chance to work on Jaws. In her 1991 book You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again, producer Julia Phillips wrote highly profane remarks about Spielberg, Zsigmond, and Truffaut, because she was fired during post-production due to a cocaine addiction. Phillips blamed it on Spielberg being a perfectionist.|$|E

5|$|Games {{are played}} on a {{rectangular}} court with raised goal rings at each end. Each team attempts to score goals by passing a ball down the court and shooting it through its goal ring. Players are assigned specific positions, which define their roles within the team and restrict their movement to {{certain areas of the}} court. During general play, a player with the ball can hold on to it for only three seconds before <b>shooting</b> <b>for</b> a goal or passing to another player. The winning team is the one that scores the most goals. Netball games are 60 minutes long. Variations have been developed to increase the game's pace and appeal to a wider audience.|$|E
5|$|Hu {{remained}} with Union {{and directed the}} company's next production, Soeara Berbisa, with peranakan sound technician Boen Kin Nam serving as assistant director. Written by Djojopranoto, the work followed two young men who compete {{for the love of}} a woman before learning that they are long-lost brothers. Djoewita had left the company at this point, and the studio hired Raden Soekarno for the leading role of this late 1941 release. The company's final completed production, Mega Mendoeng, was directed by Boen and announced soon after <b>shooting</b> <b>for</b> Soeara Berbisa had begun. This film, a romance starring Soekarno and new find Sofiati, was released in early 1942. In producing both films, Union emphasised realism and targeted educated audiences.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, Madonna was <b>shooting</b> <b>for</b> {{her third}} motion picture Who's That Girl, {{known at the}} time as Slammer. Needing songs for the soundtrack of the movie, she {{contacted}} Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray, who had written and produced her third studio album True Blue in 1986. Madonna explained to them that she needed an uptempo song and a downtempo song. She came to the studio one Thursday as Leonard developed the chorus of the song. He handed over that cassette to Madonna, who went to the backroom and finished the melody and the lyrics of the song, while Leonard worked on the other parts of the song.|$|E

5|$|Lennon's murder {{triggered}} {{an outpouring}} of grief {{around the world on}} an unprecedented scale. Lennon's remains were cremated at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, Westchester County, N.Y.; no funeral was held. Ono sent word to the chanting crowd outside the Dakota that their singing had kept her awake; she asked that they re-convene at Central Park's Naumburg Bandshell the following Sunday for ten minutes of silent prayer. On 14 December 1980, {{millions of people around the}} world responded to Ono's request to pause for ten minutes of silence to remember Lennon. Thirty thousand gathered in Liverpool, and the largest group—over 225,000—converged on New York's Central Park, close to the scene of the <b>shooting.</b> <b>For</b> those ten minutes, every radio station in New York City went off the air.|$|E
5|$|Planet Terror makes {{heavy use}} of digital effects {{throughout}} the film. Perhaps {{the most notable}} effect is Cherry's (Rose McGowan) fake leg. To accomplish the fake leg that Cherry sports after her accident, during post-production the effects teams digitally removed McGowan's right leg from the shots {{and replaced it with}} computer-generated props—first a table leg and then an M16 rifle. During <b>shooting</b> <b>for</b> these scenes, McGowan wore a special cast which restricted her leg movement to give her the correct motion, and helped the effects artists to digitally remove it during post-production.|$|E
5|$|<b>Shooting</b> <b>for</b> The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari {{began at}} the end of December 1919 and {{concluded}} {{at the end of}} January 1920. It was shot entirely in a studio without any exterior shots, which was unusual for films of the time, but dictated by the decision to give the film an Expressionist visual style. The extent to which Mayer and Janowitz participated during filming is disputed: Janowitz claims the duo repeatedly refused to allow any script changes during production, and Pommer claimed Mayer was on the set for every day of filming. But Hermann Warm claimed they were never present for any of the shooting or involved in any discussions during production.|$|E

Sundaram's manager Manickam tries to convey the news to Sundaram, but is blocked by the studio authorities who inform him that the director has instructed them not to allow anyone in there. After finishing his shot, Sundaram hears of the news about his mother and rushes home to learn that she is dead. At last realising the happiness he enjoyed as a waiter, Sundaram dons his hotel uniform again. He explains to Raghavan that the waiter's job is permanent, while the actor's was only temporary. Raghavan and Radha get married.|$|E
5|$|Actor Rishi Kapoor was {{subsequently}} cast as Rauf Lala, an underworld Don. Kapoor, {{who had never}} played a completely negative character in his entire career, was initially hesitant to sign the film. In an interview with Daily News and Analysis he stated that when Malhotra had offered him the role, he considered {{it to be a}} joke and thought that he would be the reason for the film's failure. Kapoor subsequently insisted on a test look before principal photography could begin, so that he could comfortably fit into the Muslim character of Lala, who wears kohl in his eyes, a karakul cap and is dressed in traditional kurta-pajamas. While <b>shooting</b> <b>for</b> the action sequences, Kapoor suffered several bad falls and bruises, but continued shooting and was thereby praised by co-star Hrithik Roshan for his professionalism.|$|E
5|$|Djokovic and Murray met for {{the first}} time since the {{aforementioned}} French Open final in the championship match of the season-concluding ATP World Tour Finals in London in November. Of the five meetings (all in championship matches) that took place between the pair in 2016, this one had added significance, as for the first time in tournament history, the two finalists had the chance to become year-end number 1 by winning the title. The stakes were high in Djokovic's case, as a win would have seen him win his fifth consecutive year-end title, and sixth overall (matching the record held by Roger Federer); Murray, on the other hand, was <b>shooting</b> <b>for</b> his first year-end title, having qualified for the championship match for the first time. Ultimately, Murray won in straight sets, ensuring he ended the year ranked world number one, and also becoming the first man other than Djokovic, Federer or Rafael Nadal to finish the year at the top of the rankings since Andy Roddick in 2003.|$|E
