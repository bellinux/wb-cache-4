5|$|Like dry ice, {{the main}} use of liquid {{nitrogen}} is as a refrigerant. Among other things, {{it is used}} in the cryopreservation of blood, reproductive cells (sperm and egg), and other biological samples and materials. It {{is used in the}} clinical setting in cryotherapy to remove cysts and warts on the skin. It is used in cold traps for certain laboratory equipment and to cool infrared detectors or X-ray detectors. It has also been used to cool central processing units and other devices in computers that are overclocked, and that produce more heat than during normal operation. Other uses include freeze-grinding and machining materials that are soft or rubbery at room temperature, <b>shrink-fitting</b> and assembling engineering components, and more generally to attain very low temperatures whenever necessary (around −200°C). Because of its low cost, liquid nitrogen is also often used when such low temperatures are not strictly necessary, such as refrigeration of food, freeze-branding livestock, freezing pipes to halt flow when valves are not present, and consolidating unstable soil by freezing whenever excavation is going on underneath.|$|E
50|$|Wells {{lights were}} also used in the {{erection}} and repair of large stationary steam engines. Typically this was for the <b>shrink-fitting</b> of components such as large crankpins in crankshafts or flywheels. The crankshaft web would be heated to expand it until the pin could be slid or gently hammered into place. On cooling, the pin would be securely held in place.|$|E
50|$|The {{difficulty}} with these engines {{is in their}} manufacture. The overall shape of the crankshaft and its webs is not a problem, but finishing the bearing surfaces by grinding is. There is no longer access for the large abrasive discs of a crankshaft grinder to reach each bearing, the offset crankshaft webs now being in the way. As a result, each bearing must be made and finish-ground individually; then assembled into a built-up crankshaft, usually by <b>shrink-fitting.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Shrink-fitting</b> is a {{technique}} in which an interference fit is achieved by a relative size change after assembly. This is usually achieved by heating or cooling one component before assembly and allowing it {{to return to the}} ambient temperature after assembly, employing the phenomenon of thermal expansion to make a joint. For example, the thermal expansion of a piece of a metallic drainpipe allows a builder to fit the cooler piece to it. As the adjoined pieces reach the same temperature, the joint becomes strained and stronger.|$|E
50|$|Most {{materials}} expand when {{heated and}} shrink when cooled. Enveloping parts are heated (e.g., with torches or gas ovens) and assembled into position while hot, then allowed to cool and contract {{back to their}} former size, except for the compression that results from each interfering with the other. This is {{also referred to as}} <b>shrink-fitting.</b> Railroad axles, wheels, and tires are typically assembled in this way. Alternatively, the enveloped part may be cooled before assembly such that it slides easily into its mating part. Upon warming, it expands and interferes. Cooling is often preferable as it is less likely than heating to change material properties, e.g., assembling a hardened gear onto a shaft, where the risk exists of heating the gear too much and drawing its temper.|$|E
50|$|Other {{examples}} are the fitting of a wrought iron tyre {{around the rim}} of a wooden cart wheel by a wheelwright, or of a steel tyre to {{the wheel of a}} railway engine or rolling stock. In both cases the tyre will be heated and expands to slightly greater than the wheel's diameter, and is fitted around it. After cooling, the tyre contracts, binding tightly in place. A common method used in industry is the use of induction shrink fitting which refers to the use of induction heating technology to pre-heat metal components between 150˚C and 300˚C thereby causing them to expand and allow for the insertion or removal of another component. Other methods of <b>shrink-fitting</b> include compression shrink fitting, which uses a cryogen such as liquid nitrogen to cool the insert, and shape memory coupling, which is achieved by means of a phase transition.|$|E

40|$|To model <b>shrink-fitting</b> {{in metal}} components, an {{analytical}} model for two long compound cylinders with temperature dependent material properties and interference {{between them is}} developed for calculating transient temperatures and stresses. A finite element model is developed for the same geometry which incorporated the temperature dependent material properties. A convergence study is performed on the finite element and analytical model. The finite element model is validated by comparing the approximations of finite element model with the analytical solution. In an assembly procedure of fulcrums for bascule bridges, called AP 1, the trunnion is shrink-fitted into a hub, followed by shrink fitting the trunnion-hub assembly into the girder of the bridge. In another assembly procedure called AP 2, the hub is shrink-fitted into the girder, followed by <b>shrink-fitting</b> the trunnion in the hub-girder assembly. A formal design of experiments (DOE) study is conducted on both AP 1 and AP 2 using the finite element model to find the influence of geometrical parameters such as radial thickness of the hub, radial interference, and various <b>shrink-fitting</b> methods on the design parameter of overall minimum critical crack length (OMCCL) - a measure of likelihood of failure by cracking. Using the results of DOE study conducted on both the assembly procedures, AP 1 and AP 2 are quantitatively compared for the likelihood of fracture during assembly. For single-staged <b>shrink-fitting</b> methods, for high and low hub radial thickness to hub inner diameter ratio, assembly procedure AP 1 and AP 2 are recommended, respectively. For fulcra with low hub radial thickness to hub inner diameter ratio and where staged <b>shrink-fitting</b> methods are used, for AP 2, cooling the trunnion in dry-ice/alcohol and heating the girder, and for AP 1, cooling the trunnion-hub assembly in dry-ice/alcohol followed by immersion in liquid nitrogen is recommended. For fulcra with high hub radial thickness to hub inner diameter ratio and where staged <b>shrink-fitting</b> methods are used, cooling the components in dry-ice/alcohol and heating the girder is recommended for both AP 1 and AP 2. Due to the limitations of AP 2, assembly procedures by heating the girder with heating coils instead of dipping an already stressed trunnion-hub assembly in liquid nitrogen are studied for decreasing the likelihood of failure by cracking and yielding. In an assembly procedure called AP 3 -A, only the girder is heated to shrink-fit the trunnion-hub assembly in the girder. This assembly procedure AP 3 -A {{is found to be}} infeasible because the girder fails by yielding if heating is expected to be completed in a reasonable amount of time. An alternative assembly procedure called AP 3 -B is suggested for <b>shrink-fitting</b> where the heating of the girder is combined with cooling the trunnion-hub assembly in dry-ice/alcohol mixture. This assembly procedure AP 3 -B is found to be feasible. A complete DOE study is conducted on AP 3 -B to find the influence of parameters like hub radial thickness and radial interference at trunnion-hub interface on the design parameter of overall minimum critical crack length. The design parameter, OMCCL values during the assembly procedure AP 3 -B are quantitatively compared with the widely used assembly procedures (AP 1 single-stage <b>shrink-fitting</b> and AP 1 multi-staged shrink fitting). The results of this work suggest that increasing the hub radial thickness decreases the likelihood of fracture significantly. For hubs with large radial thickness, heating the girder combined with cooling the trunnion-hub in dry-ice/alcohol mixture (AP 3 -B) is recommended but for hubs with low radial thickness, multistage cooling of the trunnion-hub assembly in dry-ice/alcohol mixture followed by dipping in liquid nitrogen (AP 1 - multistage cooling) is recommended...|$|E
40|$|The forming {{tools of}} {{multilevel}} parts may be simplified by choosing shelf dies. To support {{the axial force}} on the flanged section of the die, some corresponding support is needed on {{the interior of the}} ring as well. Going ahead with a consolidated research line, stress and strain states of shelf (or “shouldered”) dies, with fixed filling height, have been numerically analyzed by FEM. After previous study of two-diameter <b>shrink-fitting</b> surface, connected by a transversal ring, the effects of a conical <b>shrink-fitting</b> surface have been investigated. Also in this case, to assess stress distribution and strain pattern, on the nucleus and on the ring, no analytical calculation method is available, whereas the usual empirical approach sometimes leads to disappointing and expensive operating failures. The shelf geometry depends on part shape and compression ratio on the inner of the nucleus, but may be variable on the common surface nucleus/ring. In this investigation, the common profile between the outer shoulder of the nucleus and the inner shoulder of the <b>shrink-fitting</b> ring has been assumed conical, with various angles. The FEM analysis, based on two-level parts with different relative extension of flange and different heights, covers different die geometries. The effects of relative interferences have been also investigated, for typical nucleus materials, such as HSS from powder or hard metal (10...|$|E
40|$|Nett-shape {{manufacturing}} {{of engineering}} components {{is a major}} objective of modern material-conversion industries: relevant technologies depend on tools in which error-compensation can be effected. A novel die-design approach, known as the least squares approach, to minimise the component errors is presented. <b>Shrink-fitting</b> compensating die structure is employed. The errors caused by die-elasticity, secondary yielding, springback and temperature are considered {{in the process of}} minimisation. The main factors that may influence the accuracy of the optimisation procedure are analysed. The final component errors can be controlled to within a few micrometers. The approach is illustrated using axisymmetric closed-die forging...|$|E
40|$|Multilayer {{pressure}} vessel {{is designed to}} work under high-pressure condition. This paper introduces the stress analysis and the burst pressure calculation of a two-layer shrink fitted {{pressure vessel}}. In the <b>shrink-fitting</b> problems, considering long hollow cylinders, the plane strain hypothesis {{can be regarded as}} more natural. Generally hoops stress distribution is non-linear and sharply reduced toward the outer surface. By shrink fitting concentric shells towards the inner shells are placed in residual compression so that the initial compressive hoop stress must be relieved by internal pressure before hoop tensile stress are developed. Therefore the maximum hoop stress will be reduced, resulting more burst pressure. The analytical results of stress distribution and burst pressure is calculated and validated by ANSYS Workbench results...|$|E
40|$|Some shape {{features}} of gears to be manufactured by P/M may be trifling for performances, but {{important for the}} stresses level on tools. A FEM study {{on the effects of}} design (modulus, teeth number, top fillet radius, relative interference, die height, nuclei material) has been made. The FEM analysis reveals that an increase of top fillet radius lessens the Von Mises maximum stresses to levels compatible with nuclei material properties. The application of a DOE approach shows that relative interference may be a critical item, followed by nucleus material and die height., No risk of overstressing exists for <b>shrink-fitting</b> rings for ratio between diameters greater than about 4. The results may contribute to improve and optimize the design of spur gears, to be manufactured by PM, without impairing their functional properties and reliability, while reducing the risk of tool item failures...|$|E
40|$|A cooking vessel, {{especially}} for a contact heat transfer cooking system, has two or more bottom layers and a bottom face (31) which accurately matches a cooking surface (15) over the operating temperature range. Specifically, the first bottom layer is a plate (24) of ceramic, which maintains its shape in the operating temperature range, and the second bottom layer is a vessel bottom (26), which is tightly bonded to the vessel wall (22) and which consists of an elastic or ductile material. Preferably, the vessel bottom (26) consists of metal, especially specialised steel, and the ceramic plate (24) consists of a non-oxide ceramic, specifically mainly of silicon nitride or silicon carbide with optional additives. Also claimed is production of the above cooking vessel, involving <b>shrink-fitting</b> of the ceramic plate (24) in the vessel (20). ADVANTAGE - Ensures tightness of vessel under all operating conditions, including dropping the vessel or impact with a sharp object...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the optimum design for minimization of thickness of three-layer shrink-fitted compound cylinder to get equal maximum hoop stresses {{in all the}} cylinders. In the <b>shrink-fitting</b> problems, considering long hollow cylinders, the plane strain hypothesis {{can be regarded as}} more natural. Generally, hoop stress distribution across the wall of thick cylinder is non-linear in nature from inner to outer radius of the cylinder. The stresses reduce sharply towards the outer radius. Material is not utilized properly giving unnecessary more thickness. Hence two or more cylinders can be compounded by shrinkage process where outer cylinder is heated until it will slide freely over inner cylinder thus exerting the required contact pressure on cooling. As a result of shrinking, stress redistribution occurs across the wall of the compound cylinder and reduces the hoop stress and makes it more or less uniform over the thickness. In this paper effort is made to find optimum minimum thicknesses of three cylinders so that material volume is reduced and hoop stress is equal in all the cylinders. The analytical results of optimum design calculated with computer programming are validated in comparison with Finite Element Analysis in ANSYS Workbench. Both the results agree with each other. Hence this methodology can be applied for real-world mechanical applications of multi-layer compound cylinders...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{series of}} hybrid {{sandwich}} structures were fabricated by <b>shrink-fitting</b> precision-ground prisms of alumina (CoorsTek grade AD 995) with triangular, trapezoidal or rectangular cross-sections into the voids of extruded sandwich panels made from Al 6061 -T 6. The panels {{were subjected to}} impact tests using hard steel spheres over the velocity range 570 – 1800  m s− 1. A combination of X-ray tomography, high-speed video imaging and cross sectioning of impacted samples was used to investigate the penetration mechanisms. We find that the ballistic performance of these structures, characterized by the ballistic limit and the exit velocity of impact ejecta beyond this limit, is significantly improved when triangular prisms are replaced by trapezoidal prisms, provided the base width of the prism exceeds about three times the projectile diameter. Additional performance improvements are obtained when the trapezoidal prisms are replaced by rectangular prisms, albeit {{at the expense of}} an increase in the lateral extent of damage. The variations in impact response are found to arise from: (i) the effect of prism size and shape on the degree of confinement of the ceramic by the metallic webs, (ii) the core web structure, which influences the fracture conoid angle in the transverse plane, and (iii) the spacing of web-face nodes on the back face, which governs the deflection and fracture of the back-face sheet...|$|E
40|$|The {{thick-walled}} cylinder (TWC) {{technique was}} successfully used {{to investigate the}} shear-band patterning in AISI 304 stainless steel. Several factors that may influence the shear-band distribution and spacing in the TWC configuration were examined. The role of machining, annealing, and shrink fitting, {{as well as the}} variation of the shear-band distribution along the longitudinal axis of the cylindrical specimen were evaluated. Experimental results indicate that the machined surface at the internal boundary of the cylindrical specimen, where shear bands initiate, provides a strain-hardened layer that significantly changes the condition for their initiation. Specimens with such a layer have a higher density of bands with a smaller spacing, in comparison with those without a work-hardened layer. The nature of contact interface in the cylindrical specimen assembly, either causing a clearance that changes the initial loading conditions or introducing a pre-strained layer with <b>shrink-fitting</b> technique, does not influence the spacing of shear bands, but does affect the evolution and development of multiple shear bands at the initial stage. The distribution of shear bands along the cylinder has a constant spacing but the maximum lengths of bands are sensitive to the position. The collapse process of the cylindrical specimen was simulated by using the RAVEN hydrocode. The deformation, temperature, and velocity histories during the cylinder collapse were calculated. The calculated results are in good agreement with the previous experimental data...|$|E
40|$|This master thesis {{comprises}} {{analysis and}} dimensioning of a keyed joint between a generator axis and a hub with {{aid from the}} FEM-software ANSYS Workbench 13. 0. The generator axis {{is a part of}} a hydroelectric power station that generates electricity with a reactions turbine, a Kaplan turbine. The existing keyway consists of one parallel key with the width 90 mm and height 45 mm. Due to a planned increase {{of the power of the}} generated power with 32 % a design study was needed to see if the keyed joint would be suitable for the extra force. Because of the fact that the axis diameter is bigger than the standards covers/recommends a the keyway had to be re-dimensioned. In an earlier assignment from Skellefteå Kraft AB to Sweco Energuide the keyway was planned to be properly dimensioned, but no final solution was approved. During this master thesis a number of different numerical tests were made. The analyses in ANSYS Workbench showed that the old keyed joint only had a safety factor of one. The tests showed that it was the hub that was the weak link and the decider of dimensions and design when the materials yield strength and tensile strength was too low and therefore essential. A number of attempts were made to increase the safety factor by adding both two and three keys to the keyed joint, but without success. With the existing material in the hub and axis it was not possible to reach the requested safety factor of three in the joint, no matter what dimensions the keyways had. The solution was to change the material in the axis and the hub to a more high quality steel with a larger yield and tensile strength. By using a typical steel for turbine axis, with a yield strength of 700 MPa for the axis and 455 MPa for the hub, a safety factor of 2, 8 was achieved. The new keyed joint consists of two keyways spread 180 degrees apart with a standardized size of 100 mm width and 50 mm height together with a <b>shrink-fitting</b> between the axis and the hub. The main reason why two keyways were used instead of three was to get a more robust solution. As a conclusion the maximum effective stress was lowered with 55 % in the axis and 82 % in the hub...|$|E
