40|$|Many {{structures}} {{consisting of}} magnetic layers {{separated by a}} nonmagnetic spacer layer show an oscillatory exchange coupling.

The periods of the oscillatory coupling are set by extremal <b>spanning</b> <b>vectors</b> of the Fermi surface of the spacer layer material. The strength of the coupling depends both on the geometry of the Fermi surface and on the reflection amplitudes for electrons scattering from the interfaces between the spacer layers and the magnetic layers.

40|$|The {{extensive}} research done on interlayer exchange coupling in transition metal multilayers {{has resulted in}} a deep understanding of this coupling and a remarkable agreement between theoretical results and measurements. The coupling between two magnetic layers separated by a non-magnetic spacer layer is mediated by the electrons of the spacer layer. The coupling, which oscillates in sign {{as a function of the}} thickness of the spacer layer, is closely related to the well-known RKKY interaction between magnetic impurities. Due to the existence of many high-quality measurements, it has been much more fully developed theoretically than the interaction between impurities. Theory predicts that the periods of the oscillatory coupling should depend on critical <b>spanning</b> <b>vectors</b> of the Fermi surface belonging to the spacerlayer material. There is remarkable agreement for the measured periods and those predicted from the Fermi surfaces. There is also substantial agreement between theory and experiment on the strength of the coupling.

40|$|We {{have found}} that some periods of {{interlayer}} exchange coupling (IEC) oscillations {{as a function of}} cap-layer (CL) thickness may be suppressed if the in-plane extremal <b>spanning</b> <b>vectors</b> of the cap- and ferromagnet-materials Fermi surfaces do not coincide. The suppression of the IEC oscillations vs. the CL thickness holds also if the magnetic slab thickness tends to infinity. On the one hand, we have shown by means of very simple arguments that apart from the well-known selection rules concerning the spacer- and cap-layers, another one related with the magnetic sublayers has to be fulfilled in order that the interlayer coupling oscillations $vs. $ CL thickness could survive. On the other hand, the distribution of induced magnetic moments across the non-magnetic cap- and spacer-sublayers have been computed and shown to reveal the underlying periodicity of the materials they are made of (i. e. related to their bulk Fermi surfaces) independently {{of whether or not the}} selection rules are fulfilled. This means that the IEC oscillations are of global nature and depend on all the sublayers the system consists of.

40|$|Two {{dimensional}} tensor networks such as projected entangled pairs states (PEPS) {{are generally}} hard to contract. This {{is arguably the}} main reason why variational tensor network methods in 2 D are still not as successful as in 1 D. However, {{this is not necessarily}} the case if the tensor network represents a gapped ground state of a local Hamiltonian; such states are subject to many constraints and contain much more structure. In this paper we introduce a new approach for approximating the expectation value of a local observable in ground states of local Hamiltonians that are represented as PEPS tensor-networks. Instead of contracting the full tensor-network, we try to estimate the expectation value using only a local patch of the tensor-network around the observable. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that this is often easier to do when the system is frustrated. In such case, the <b>spanning</b> <b>vectors</b> of the local patch are subject to non-trivial constraints that can be utilized via a semi-definite program to calculate rigorous lower- and upper-bounds on the expectation value. We test our approach in 1 D systems, where we show how the expectation value can be calculated up to at least 3 or 4 digits of precision, even when the patch radius is smaller than the correlation length.
