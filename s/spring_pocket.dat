5000|$|Marshall coils, {{also known}} as wrapped or encased coils or <b>pocket</b> <b>springs,</b> are thin-gauge, barrel-shaped, knotless coils {{individually}} encased in fabric pockets—normally a fabric from man-made, nonwoven fiber. Some manufacturers precompress these coils, which makes the mattress firmer and allows for motion separation between {{the sides of the}} bed. As the springs are not wired together, they work more or less independently: the weight on one spring does not affect its neighbours.

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{predictable}} handling of a race car, local mounts connecting suspension components to the chassis should be sufficiently rigid to minimize unwanted local deflection which may adversely affect suspension geometry. In this work, the effects of local chassis flexibility of the spring perch on roll stiffness, tire camber change, and steer angle change are determined from a finite element model (FEM) of a Winston Cup race car. Details such as side gussets, supporting brackets, and local curvature of the frame rail <b>spring</b> <b>pocket</b> are included in a shell model of the spring perch. The local shell model of the spring perch is integrated with the global finite element stiffness model of the chassis and suspension consisting of an assembly of beam and shell elements.

40|$|In this {{research}} natural fibre (biomaterial) <b>pocket</b> <b>spring</b> mattresses are shown to emit marginally less greenhouse gasses (GHG) than foam (petrochemical) <b>pocket</b> <b>spring</b> mattresses. However, when {{end of life}} scenarios are considered, the results suggest much larger GHG emission reductions for natural fibre than foam mattresses. Refurbishing natural fibre mattresses and reusing the springs, coupled with recycling the waste components, can reduce GHG emissions by 90 % compared to sending the mattresses to landfill. Incinerating mattresses via {{combined heat and power}} plants for electricity production and converting the waste textiles to ethanol are also shown to reduce GHG emissions, though to a lesser extent than refurbishment and recycling. Mattresses are normally disposed of via landfill however designing for reuse and recycling, coupled with supportive policy and legislation, may encourage more natural fibre mattresses and recycling. Such changes could save between 210 and 2092 thousand tCO 2 -eq in the European Union annually...|$|R
50|$|Vispring, {{formerly}} known as Vi-Spring, is a bed company founded in 1901 in Plymouth, in the South West of England, marketing beds made of natural materials. Part of Vispring's notability comes from being the first English bed makers to use the Marshall patent <b>pocketed</b> <b>spring</b> coil now {{commonly referred to as}} the Marshall coil. By 1914 Marshall Mattress' mattress collections were found in luxurious hotels, clubs and ocean liners, including The Queen Mary & The Titanic.|$|R
40|$|Improvement of the {{environmental}} performance of processes and products is a common objective in industry, and has been receiving increased attention in recent years. The main objective of this work is to evaluate the potential environmental impact of two bedding products, a polyurethane foam mattress (PFM) and a <b>pocket</b> <b>spring</b> mattress (PSM). These two types {{are the most common}} mattresses used in Europe. A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) shows that the PFM has a higher environmental impact than the PSM. For both products the main cause of environmental impact is the manufacturing process, respectively the polyurethane foam block moulding process for the PFM, and the <b>pocket</b> <b>spring</b> nucleus process for the PSM. A scenario analysis shows the possibility of reducing {{the environmental}} impact of the products’ life cycle using an alternative End-of-Life scenario, resorting to incineration rather than landfill. Two strategies were also studied {{in order to reduce the}} environmental impact of the PFM: (1) reutilization of foam that was sent to the waste system management, and (2) a 20 % weight reduction of the polyurethane foam. The second strategy has proven to be the most effective.

50|$|It {{is often}} stated that Tompion invented the {{particular}} type of balance <b>spring</b> regulation in <b>pocket</b> watches widely used until the late 19th century. This has the curb pins mounted on a sector rack, and moved by a pinion on which is mounted a graduated and numbered disc. While this system was used by Tompion, many refer to it incorrectly as the 'Tompion regulator'. However, he certainly did not invent this system, as such regulating devices were already in use by the 1670s on French balance spring watches of the Thuret pattern.|$|R

50|$|Early {{mattresses}} {{contained a}} variety of natural materials including straw, feathers or horse hair. In {{the first half of}} the 20th century, a typical mattress sold in North America had an innerspring core and cotton batting or fiberfill. Modern mattresses usually contain either an inner spring core or materials such as latex, viscoelastic or other flexible polyurethane foams. Other fill components include insulator pads over the coils that prevent the bed's upholstery layers from cupping down into the innerspring, as well as polyester fiberfill in the bed's top upholstery layers.

He glanced around. Red Gallagher and his mate were racing almost beside it towards him. He rushed up the narrow stairs into the signal room, tearing open his coat to show his official badge.|$|R

The Hispanic population increased by an amount between 1,000 and 3,500 per square mile. In 1997 S.D. Kim, the Houston bureau chief of The Korea Times, said that Koreatown, the Korean community in Spring Branch, grew because of inexpensive housing and the zoning to the Spring Branch Independent School District. In 1998 and again in 2001, a proposal to place Korean language street signs in Koreatown lead to political controversy; the reaction against the proposal lead to the withdrawal of the proposal. By 2006, Spring Branch Elementary School was mostly Hispanic, reflecting demographic changes in the Spring Branch area. By 2007 several older houses were torn down and replaced with newer houses; new homeowners came to Spring Branch to buy larger lots, to buy in an area cheaper than neighborhoods bordering Downtown Houston. New residents came due to the proximity to Downtown, Uptown, and the Energy Corridor.|$|R
