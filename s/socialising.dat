5|$|Lions {{spend much}} of their time resting and are {{inactive}} for about 20hours per day. Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of <b>socialising,</b> grooming, and defecating. Intermittent bursts of activity follow through the night hours until dawn, when hunting most often takes place. They spend an average of two hours a day walking and 50minutes eating.|$|E
5|$|Orangutans {{are among}} the most {{intelligent}} primates. Experiments suggest they can figure out some invisible displacement problems with a representational strategy. In addition, Zoo Atlanta has a touch-screen computer where their two Sumatran orangutans play games. Scientists hope the data they collect will help researchers learn about <b>socialising</b> patterns, such as whether the apes learn behaviours through trial and error or by mimicry, and point to new conservation strategies.|$|E
5|$|He donated his parents' house, Osborne on the Isle of Wight, to {{the state}} and {{continued}} to live at Sandringham. He could afford to be magnanimous; his private secretary, Sir Francis Knollys, claimed that he was the first heir to succeed to the throne in credit. Edward's finances had been ably managed by Sir Dighton Probyn, Comptroller of the Household, and had benefited from advice from Edward's Jewish financier friends, such as Ernest Cassel, Maurice de Hirsch and the Rothschild family. At a time of widespread anti-Semitism, Edward attracted criticism for openly <b>socialising</b> with Jews.|$|E

5|$|James I used Windsor Castle {{primarily}} {{as a base for}} hunting, one of his favourite pursuits, and for <b>socialising</b> with his friends. Many of these occasions involved extensive drinking sessions, including one with Christian IV of Denmark in 1606 that became infamous across Europe for the resulting drunken behaviour of the two kings. The absence of space at Windsor continued to prove problematic, with James' English and Scottish retinues often quarrelling over rooms.|$|E
5|$|Wine and beer, {{especially}} of the home-made varieties, were central to <b>socialising</b> in Wales, {{as they were in}} England. This remained the case even when tea gained popularity in England, supplanting the home-made alcohol. Beer is now the national drink of Wales, although Welsh beers never gained the status of other British beers, such as stout or English ales. This was in part due to the breweries keeping promotion of their products to a minimum so as not to upset the temperance movement in Wales.|$|E
5|$|Australian {{police were}} unclear {{how the two}} groups from Sydney and Brisbane were linked, but did {{establish}} the movements {{of members of the}} group before their departure for Indonesia. Several of the Bali Nine were employed by Eurest Australia, a multinational catering company with more than 9000 employees. Norman, Lawrence, Martin, Stephens and Chan, a supervisor with the company, all worked for Eurest, which provided hospitality services to the Sydney Cricket Ground, where the group was employed. Rush and Czugaj alleged they were recruited by Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen, their co-defendant and the alleged financier of the smuggling plan, while <b>socialising</b> at a karaoke bar in Brisbane.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} outlined in the following pages was to examine the impact that the visible signs of brain injury and perceptions of dangerousness and responsibility have on participants’ willingness to <b>socialise</b> with adolescent survivors of brain injury. The research has two articles, and Article Two has two studies. In Article One, participants were shown a picture of either an adolescent male or female, with or without a head scar, with a brief vignette advising that the adolescent had sustained a brain injury. Participants reported that others would be more willing to <b>socialise</b> with the adolescents with a scar, than the adolescents with no scar, and female participants reported that others would be more willing to <b>socialise</b> with the female adolescent, than the male adolescent. Article Two used a similar paradigm to Article One. Study one of Article Two replicated Article One and added an additional factor, knowledge about how to interact, as a factor influencing willingness to <b>socialise.</b> Results showed that participants with more knowledge about how to interact with survivors were more willing to <b>socialise,</b> than participants with less knowledge. Study two examined whether describing the adolescents as dangerous or responsible for contributing to, or causing their brain injury, would influence willingness to <b>socialise.</b> Results showed strong support for a danger model, where perceptions of dangerousness were mediated by fear. When the adolescents’ were described as dangerous, fear increased and subsequent willingness to <b>socialise</b> decreased. To a lesser extent, support was found for a responsibility model. Perceptions of being responsible (falling and sustaining a significant injury to the head after drinking too much alcohol) increased anger but anger in turn did not impact willingness to <b>socialise.</b> Being described as not responsible (as a result of a brain tumour) increased pity, but again there was no relationship between pity and willingness to <b>socialise.</b> This information is useful for rehabilitation professionals assisting adolescents’ re-integration back into the community post injury. Informing survivors that people’s attitudes may change once visible signs of injury heal may be relevant when managing expectations of how others may treat them. It may also be useful to discuss how others may perceive them when they have contributed to causing their current condition or are perceived as dangerous. Finally, knowledge about how to interact may be useful for policy makers when designing campaigns to reduce discrimination...|$|R
5|$|Wilhelm I granted Charlotte and Bernhard a villa near Tiergarten in Berlin and {{transferred}} Bernhard to a regiment in the city. Charlotte {{spent much of}} her time <b>socialising</b> with other ladies, where it was common to pursue activities such as skating, gossiping, and holding dinner parties. She was admired for her fashion sense, having imported all of her clothing from Paris. Charlotte also smoked and drank, and was liked by many for hosting entertaining parties. She earned a reputation as a gossip, and many found her acid-tongued; she was known for befriending someone and earning their confidence, only to spread their secrets to others.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part, Germans {{accepted}} the Nuremberg Laws, partly because Nazi propaganda had successfully swayed public opinion towards the general belief that Jews were a separate race, {{but also because}} to oppose the regime meant leaving oneself open to harassment or arrest by the Gestapo. Citizens were relieved that the antisemitic violence ceased after the laws were passed. Non-Jews gradually stopped <b>socialising</b> with Jews or shopping in Jewish-owned stores. Wholesalers who continued to serve Jewish merchants were marched through the streets with placards around their necks proclaiming them as traitors. The Communist party and some elements of the Catholic Church were critical of the laws. Concerned that international opinion would be adversely swayed by the new laws, the Interior Ministry did not actively enforce them until after the 1936 Summer Olympics, held in Berlin that August.|$|E
5|$|Moon {{grew up in}} Alperton, {{a suburb}} of Wembley, in Middlesex, and took up the drums during the early 1960s. After playing with a local band, the Beachcombers, he joined the Who in 1964 before they {{recorded}} their first single. Moon remained with the band during their rise to fame, and was quickly recognised for his drumming style, which emphasised tom-toms, cymbal crashes, and drum fills. He occasionally collaborated with other musicians and later appeared in films, but considered playing in the Who his primary occupation and remained {{a member of the}} band until his death. In addition to his talent as a drummer, however, Moon developed a reputation for smashing his kit on stage and destroying hotel rooms on tour. He was fascinated by blowing up toilets with cherry bombs or dynamite, and by destroying television sets. Moon enjoyed touring and <b>socialising,</b> and was bored and restless when the Who were inactive. His 21st birthday party in Flint, Michigan, has been cited as a notorious example of decadent behaviour by rock groups.|$|E

5|$|The Nuremberg Laws had a {{crippling}} {{economic and social}} impact on the Jewish community. Persons convicted of violating the marriage laws were imprisoned, and (subsequent to 8 March 1938) upon completing their sentences were re-arrested by the Gestapo and sent to Nazi concentration camps. Non-Jews gradually stopped <b>socialising</b> with Jews or shopping in Jewish-owned stores, many of which closed {{due to lack of}} customers. As Jews were no longer permitted to work in the civil service or government-regulated professions such as medicine and education, many middle class business owners and professionals were forced to take menial employment. Emigration was problematic, as Jews were required to remit up to 90 per cent of their wealth as a tax upon leaving the country. By 1938 it was almost impossible for potential Jewish emigrants to find a country willing to take them. Mass deportation schemes such as the Madagascar Plan proved to be impossible for the Nazis to carry out, and starting in mid-1941, the German government started mass exterminations of the Jews of Europe.|$|E
5|$|After her husband's death, Mary Shelley {{lived for}} a year with Leigh Hunt and his family in Genoa, where she often saw Byron and {{transcribed}} his poems. She resolved to live by her pen and for her son, but her financial situation was precarious. On 23 July 1823, she left Genoa for England and stayed with her father and stepmother in the Strand until a small advance from her father-in-law enabled her to lodge nearby. Sir Timothy Shelley had at first agreed to support his grandson, Percy Florence, only if he were handed over to an appointed guardian. Mary Shelley rejected this idea instantly. She managed instead to wring out of Sir Timothy a limited annual allowance (which she had to repay when Percy Florence inherited the estate), but {{to the end of}} his days he refused to meet her in person and dealt with her only through lawyers. Mary Shelley busied herself with editing her husband's poems, among other literary endeavours, but concern for her son restricted her options. Sir Timothy threatened to stop the allowance if any biography of the poet were published. In 1826, Percy Florence became the legal heir of the Shelley estate after the death of his half-brother Charles Shelley, his father's son by Harriet Shelley. Sir Timothy raised Mary's allowance from £100 a year to £250 but remained as difficult as ever. Mary Shelley enjoyed the stimulating society of William Godwin's circle, but poverty prevented her from <b>socialising</b> as she wished. She also felt ostracised by those who, like Sir Timothy, still disapproved of her relationship with Percy Bysshe Shelley.|$|E
