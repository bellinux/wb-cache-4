On the 31st of that month, both ships began to pursue , which was escorting two {{merchant}} ships.

5|$|The pediments, metopes, and {{shield of}} the Parthenos all {{illustrate}} the mythological past {{and as the}} deities are observing on the east frieze, it is natural to reach for a mythological explanation. Chrysoula Kardara, has ventured that the relief shows us the first Panathenaic procession instituted under the mythical King Kekrops. This explanation would account {{for the absence of}} the allies and the ship, as these post-date the original practice of the sacrificial rite. In evidence she offers E35 as the future King Erichthonios presenting the first peplos to his predecessor Kekrops, iconographically similar to the boy’s depiction on a fragmentary kylix of the 450s. A recent interpretation by Joan Breton Connelly identifies the central scene on the east frieze (hence above the door to the cella and focal point of the procession) not as the handing over of Athena’s peplos by the arrhephoroi, but the donning of sacrificial garb by the daughter of King Erechtheus in preparation for the sacrifice of her life. An interpretation suggested by the text of the fragmentary papyrus remains of Euripides’s Erichtheus, wherein her life is demanded in order to save the city from Eumolpos and the Eleusinians. Thus, the deities turn their backs to prevent pollution from the <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> death. A contentious subject in the field, Connelly's {{solution to the problem of}} meaning poses as many problems as it answers.|$|E

500|$|HMS Queen Mary {{was similar}} to the s, though she was {{slightly}} larger and given more powerful engines to achieve the same speed as the earlier ships. Her secondary guns were better protected and some of her belt armour was redistributed. She was the last battlecruiser completed before the beginning of the war, and she participated in the Battle of Heligoland Bight shortly after the war began. As part of the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, she unsuccessfully attempted to intercept a German force that bombarded the North Sea coast of England in December 1914. She was refitting during the Battle of Dogger Bank in early 1915, but participated in the next major fleet action of the war, the Battle of Jutland in mid-1916. Queen Mary hit the German battlecruiser [...] early in the battle and burnt out one of that ship's rear turrets. Seydlitz later knocked out one of Queen Marys main guns.

500|$|The {{original}} Broadway production {{opened at}} the Majestic Theatre on April 19, 1945.

[...] One successful last-minute change was to have de Mille choreograph the pantomime. [...] The movement of the carnival crowd in the pantomime had been entrusted to Mamoulian, and his version was not working. [...] Rodgers had injured his back the previous week, and he watched the opening from a stretcher propped in a box behind the curtain. [...] Sedated with morphine, he could see {{only part of the}} stage. [...] As he could not hear the audience's applause and laughter, he assumed the show was a failure. [...] It was not until friends congratulated him later that evening that he realized that the curtain had been met by wild applause. [...] Bambi Linn, who played Louise, was so enthusiastically received by the audience during her ballet that she was forced to break character, when she next appeared, and bow.

Cyrus then relocated from Franklin, Tennessee to Los Angeles, California to commence work on the Disney Channel original series Hannah Montana. At the <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> grandfather ailing from afar, Cyrus was inspired to compose [...] "I Miss You".

500|$|At 17:20, a 13.5in(34cm) shell {{from the}} battlecruiser [...] struck the barbette of Von der Tanns Aturret. A chunk of armor plate was {{dislodged}} {{from inside the}} turret, and struck the turret training gear, which jammed the turret at 120degrees. This put the turret out of action {{for the duration of}} the engagement. At 17:23, the ship was hit again by a 13.5in(34cm) shell from Tiger, which struck near the Cturret and killed 6 men. The shell holed the deck and created enough wreckage that the turret was unable to traverse, and the starboard rudder engine room was damaged. The Cturret was out of action until the wreckage could be cut away. Smoke from a fire caused by burning practice targets that had been stowed below the turret obscured the ship. Sections of the torpedo nets were knocked loose and trailed behind the ship. However, they were cut loose before they could catch in the propellers. New Zealand, which had been engaging Von der Tann following Indefatigables destruction, lost <b>sight</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> target and shifted fire to Moltke. At 17:18, the range to Von der Tann from Barham had closed to 17,500yd(16,000m), at which point Von der Tann opened fire on the British battleship. Shortly thereafter, at 17:23, Von der Tann registered a hit on Barham. However, after firing only 24 shells, Von der Tann had to return to her earlier target, New Zealand, because her fore and aft turrets had since been disabled, and her amidships turrets were no longer able to target Barham.|$|E

[...] A dirty rag tied around her head was soaked with blood from a wounded ear. [...] According to her story she had been attacked by two men near Bedlam Hospital. [...] They had partially stripped her, robbed her and hit her in the temple, rendering her unconscious. [...] She awoke [...] "by a large road, where was water, with the two men that robbed me" [...] and was forced to walk to a house, where an old woman asked if she would [...] "go their way" [...] (become a prostitute).

[...] There the young maidservant had remained for almost a month, with no visitors and existing only on bread and water. [...] The clothing she wore she had scavenged from a fireplace in the loft. [...] Canning had eventually made her escape by pulling some boards away from a window and walking the five-hour journey home. [...] She recalled hearing the name [...] "Wills or Wells", and as she had seen through the window a coachman she recognised, thought she had been held on the Hertford Road.

Logan is a commercial traveler and, as the play opens, is preparing to leave on a business trip. He takes the train to the city, where he is attacked by footpads, who leave him unconscious in the roadway. He is found by Maud Neal and her father, who are passing in an auto, and they take him into their home. There he revives, but the shock has affected his memory, and {{he is unable to}} recall anything of his past life. The kindly Neal secures him employment, and as time passes Logan falls deeply in love with Maud. He finally proposes to her and it is accepted. In the meantime, little May has been waiting in vain for her father. As no word is received from him, and she has no other relatives, Bridget, the servant, takes her to the orphan asylum, where she is compelled to make her home with other little unfortunates. May dislikes the place. In the end she escapes from it. But, gaining the city, she gets lost there and, tired and hungry, goes to sleep on a doorstep - the Neals'. There she is found by Maud, who takes her into the house. Maud is much attracted by the child's charms and finally decides that she must never be parted from her. She tells Logan of her decision and he objects. They quarrel. Feeling himself in the wrong, Logan returns and asks Maud's pardon. He meets May, who recognizes her father.
