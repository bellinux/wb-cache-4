5|$|<b>Spatial</b> <b>economics</b> {{deal with}} {{distance}} and area, {{and how these}} may affect a market through transportation costs and geographical limitations. The development of <b>spatial</b> <b>economics</b> is usually ascribed to German economist Johann Heinrich von Thünen; however, Cantillon addressed <b>spatial</b> <b>economics</b> nearly a century earlier. Cantillon integrated his advancements in spatial economic theory into his microeconomic analysis of the market, describing how transportation costs influence the location of factories, markets and population centres—that is, individuals strive to lower transportation costs. Conclusions on <b>spatial</b> <b>economics</b> were derived from three premises: cost of raw materials of equal quality will always be higher near the capital city, due to transportation costs; transportation costs vary on transportation type (for example, water transportation was considered cheaper than land-based transportation); and larger goods that {{are more difficult to}} transport will always be cheaper closer to their area of production. For example, Cantillon believed markets were designed as they were to decrease costs to both merchants and villagers in terms of time and transportation. Similarly, Cantillon posited that the locations of cities were the result in large part of the wealth of inhabiting property owners and their ability to afford transportation costs—wealthier property owners tended to live farther from their property, because they could afford the transportation costs. In Essai, spatial economic theory was used to derive why markets occupied the geographical area they did and why costs varied across different markets.|$|E

5|$|Apart from {{originating}} {{theories on}} the entrepreneur and <b>spatial</b> <b>economics,</b> Cantillon {{also provided a}} dedicated theory on population growth. Unlike William Petty, who believed there always existed {{a considerable amount of}} unused land and economic opportunity to support economic growth, Cantillon theorised that population grows only {{as long as there are}} economic opportunities present. Specifically, Cantillon cited three determining variables for population size: natural resources, technology, and culture. Therefore, populations grow only as far as the three aforementioned variables allowed. Furthermore, Cantillon's population theory was more modern than that of Malthus in the sense that Cantillon recognised a much broader category of factors which affect population growth, including the tendency for population growth to fall to zero as a society becomes more industrialised.|$|E

California State University, Los Angeles, 2012 Committee members: Stephen Pollard, Dang TranDeveloping Countries, Economic Long-term Growth, Economic Openness, OECD, Regional <b>Economics,</b> <b>Spatial</b> EconomicsRegional <b>economics</b> is {{topic that}} has {{recently}} faded with {{increased levels of}} globalization causing many {{to think that the}} world is 'flat' and opportunities for economic success are equal for all countries. The aim of this thesis is to test whether region has an impact on long-term growth and economic trade openness for countries across the globe. After gathering panel data for 150 countries for the years 2002 to 2009, it was concluded that region has a significant impact on both variables. Policies and laws developed to promote economic growth and increase trade should differ for countries, depending on what region they are located in. Some regions are drastically ahead of others.

2500|$|In 1985, {{in a book}} {{entitled}} Économie spatiale: rationalité économique de l'espace habité, Tellier formulated an all-new problem called the [...] "attraction-repulsion problem", which constitutes a generalization of both the Fermat and Weber problems. In its simplest version, the attraction-repulsion problem consists in locating a point D with respect to three points A1, A2 and R {{in such a way}} that the attractive forces exerted by points A1 and A2, and the repulsive force exerted by point R cancel each other out. In the same book, Tellier solved that problem for the first time in the triangle case, and he reinterpreted <b>spatial</b> <b>economics</b> theory, especially, the theory of land rent, in the light of the concepts of attractive and repulsive forces stemming from the attraction-repulsion problem. That problem was later further analyzed by mathematicians like Chen, Hansen, Jaumard and Tuy (1992), and Jalal and Krarup (2003). The attraction-repulsion problem is seen by Ottaviano and Thisse (2005) as a prelude to the New Economic Geography that developed in the 1990s, and earned Paul Krugman a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008.|$|E

40|$|This is a {{critical}} review of examples of how workers' settlements have been organized throughout history. I examine some examples of workers' settlements {{from the perspective of}} <b>spatial</b> organization, architectural <b>economics</b> and urban design. The hypothesis is that workers' dwellings have not basically changed since the earliest civilizations. The role of workers' dwellings has been constantly on the fringes of spatial organization. Generally, workers as a class were not considered an integral part of business management. Workers are part of any industrialized process and cannot be overlooked in an architectural analysis of their dwellings. The conclusions of the paper are oriented from praxis to theory.

40|$|Agent-based {{computational}} modeling {{is changing}} the face of social science. In Generative Social Science, Joshua Epstein argues that this powerful, novel technique permits the social sciences to meet a fundamentally new standard of explanation, in which one "grows" the phenomenon of interest in an artificial society of interacting agents: heterogeneous, boundedly rational actors, represented as mathematical or software objects. After elaborating this notion of generative explanation in a pair of overarching foundational chapters, Epstein illustrates it with examples chosen from such far-flung fields as archaeology, civil conflict, the evolution of norms, epidemiology, retirement <b>economics,</b> <b>spatial</b> games, and organizational adaptation. In elegant chapter preludes, he explains how these widely diverse modeling studies support his sweeping case for generative explanation. This book represents a powerful consolidation of Epstein's interdisciplinary research activities in the decade since the publication of his and Robert Axtell's landmark volume, Growing Artificial Societies. Beautifully illustrated, Generative Social Science includes a CD that contains animated movies of core model runs, and programs allowing users to easily change assumptions and explore models, making it an invaluable text for courses in modeling at all levels. computational modeling, social science, generative explanation, archaeology, civil conflict, evolution of norms, epidemiology, retirement <b>economics,</b> <b>spatial</b> games, organizational adaptation...|$|R

We examine this issue using a unique data set [...] all private condominium transactions in Singapore during an eleven-year period. We model directly the price discovery process for individual dwellings. Our empirical results clearly reject a random walk in prices, supporting mean reversion in housing prices and diffusion of innovations over space. We find that, when house prices and aggregate returns are computed from models that erroneously assume a random walk and spatial independence, they are strongly autocorrelated. However, when they are calculated from the appropriate model, predictability in prices and in investment returns is completely absent. We show that {{this is due to}} the illiquid nature of housing transactions. We also conduct extensive simulations, over different time horizons and with different investment rules, testing whether better information on housing price dynamics leads to superior investment performance. housing market liquidity, price discovery, <b>spatial</b> correlation, <b>Economics...</b>|$|R
