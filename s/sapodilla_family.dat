50|$|Pouteria myrsinoides subsp. reticulata, {{commonly}} known as axe-handle wood, is a flowering plant in the <b>sapodilla</b> <b>family,</b> Sapotaceae. The subspecific epithet refers to the reticulate venation (network-like pattern of the veins) on the leaves.|$|E
5000|$|Pouteria sandwicensis is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} tree in the <b>sapodilla</b> <b>family,</b> Sapotaceae, that is endemic to the main islands of Hawaii. Names for this species in the Hawaiian language include Ālaa, Āulu and Ēlaa.|$|E
50|$|Manilkara jaimiqui, {{commonly}} known as wild dilly, is a woody plant in the <b>sapodilla</b> <b>family.</b> It is native to tropical regions of North America, where it {{is found in the}} West Indies and south Florida. Its natural habitat is areas of coastal hammocks and pine rocklands.|$|E
5000|$|Frontera Corozal {{is located}} in the Lacandon Jungle where it borders the Usumacinta River and the {{northern}} edge of the Montes Azules Biosphere Reserve. The surrounding ecosystem is perennial tropical rainforest with plant species such as palms, oak, cedar, mahogany, Platymiscium (legume <b>family),</b> <b>sapodilla</b> (Manilkara zapota), rubber trees, pine, cypress, romerillo (a type of conifer), Montezuma cypress, manchineel, ficus and guarumbo (Cecropia) [...] Wildlife species include wild boar, bats, deer, skunks, pumas, turtles and various types of snakes and birds. However, the rainforest area has been badly damaged due to overexploitation and clearing. In early 2011, over 600 communal farmers from the area entered into an agreement with the government to conserve the environment on their lands in exchange for payment under the Reducción de Emisiones por Deforestación y Degradación Evitada plus (REDD+) plan. The communal land owners created seven reserves on their lands. In exchange, each member of the communal organization received 2,000 pesos as a first payment, brought personally by the state’s governor, Juan Sabines Guerrero. The agreement calls for monthly payments as well as assistance in creating tourism opportunities and groves of palm oil trees on non reserve lands.|$|R
50|$|Manilkara rufula is {{a species}} of tree in the <b>Sapodilla</b> <b>family.</b> It is endemic to the northeastern submontane forests of Bahia, Sergipe, Pernambuco, Paraíba, Ceará and Piauí states of Brazil. Although this species exists in many places, where it occurs it is either not numerous, or its numbers are declining due to loss of habitat.|$|E
50|$|Manilkara excisa (known {{locally as}} either Sapodilla Bullet, Sapodilla or simply Sappa) is an {{endangered}} species of tall tree in the <b>Sapodilla</b> <b>family.</b> It is endemic to the extremely steep, forested limestone hills of Trelawny, Cockpit Country and St. James parishes in Jamaica, where, although it is highly prized for its wood, it is threatened by habitat loss.|$|E
50|$|Manilkara valenzuelana is {{a species}} of tree or tall shrub in the <b>Sapodilla</b> <b>family.</b> It is found in coastal and subcoastal semi-deciduous forests of Cuba (Pinar del Río and Oriente), the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and {{possibly}} Puerto Rico. Its habitat has been declining rapidly under pressure from charcoal makers, logging, and the clearing of forest for human habitation.|$|E
50|$|Manilkara dardanoi is a {{tree species}} in the <b>Sapodilla</b> <b>family.</b> It is endemic to Brazil, and only found in {{a small portion of}} Pernambuco. Here it grows in forests mostly along the coast, or {{elsewhere}} deeper inland where there is old secondary forest. Unfortunately, its natural habitat is gradually disappearing as forest is felled and land is cleared for human settlement.|$|E
50|$|Manilkara kanosiensis (commonly {{known as}} Torem or Sawai) is {{a species of}} tree in the <b>Sapodilla</b> <b>family.</b> It is thinly {{dispersed}} in low-lying rainforests over a large range, from the Muluku Islands of Indonesia to the Bismarck Archipelago (New Britain and New Ireland) of Papua New Guinea. It is endangered by the furious pace of logging in its native habitat, where it is felled as timber.|$|E
50|$|Manilkara spectabilis, or Bully Tree (not to be {{confused}} with other trees with the same common name), is a little-understood, critically endangered species of tree in the <b>Sapodilla</b> <b>family.</b> It has only ever been collected for botanical study once, from a single site near Limón in the Atlantic coastal forests of Costa Rica. It is believed to be endemic to this lowland region, the rainforests of which, though once unbroken, are now honeycombed by ongoing logging operations.|$|E
50|$|Manilkara gonavensis is a {{tree species}} in the <b>Sapodilla</b> <b>family,</b> found nowhere else but Haiti. It has only ever been {{collected}} one time for study, when the type specimen was taken. This {{was in the early}} 20th century, before 1929, which is the year it was described (the year of a plant's collection often predates its description by years, sometimes even decades). Consequently, very little is known about M. gonavensis, and further study is needed. The specimen was taken from Haiti's Gonâve Island, which is reflected in the choice of its specific epithet.|$|E
50|$|Sideroxylon celastrinum is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the <b>sapodilla</b> <b>family,</b> Sapotaceae, that is native to Texas and Florida in the United States south through Central America to northern Venezuela and Colombia in South America. Common names include saffron plum and coma. It is a spiny shrub or small tree that reaches a height of 2 - 9 m. The dark green leaves are alternate or fascicled at the nodes and oblanceolate to obovate. Greenish-white flowers are present from May to November and are followed by single-seeded, blue-black drupes.|$|E
