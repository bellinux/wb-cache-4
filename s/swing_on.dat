5|$|Physics play an {{important}} role in New Super Mario Bros.s improved game mechanics. Without the rigid restrictions of tile-based sprites and backgrounds, the designers were free to explore new gameplay mechanics; when Mario lands on top of a tree, it teeters over and eventually falls if he is stationary for too long. Mario can also <b>swing</b> <b>on</b> ropes and walk on wires that bend and stretch under his weight.|$|E
5|$|The {{marketing}} campaign started in full <b>swing</b> <b>on</b> June 27, 2005, when the teaser trailer made its debut, first online at the official Volkswagen website at 8:45p.m. EDT, then 8:55p.m. EDT across media outlets owned by NBC Universal (the parent of Universal Studios), including NBC, Bravo!, CNBC, and MSNBC. That trailer appeared in theatres attached to War of the Worlds, which opened on June 29.|$|E

5|$|During the pre-show of WrestleMania XXX, the Real Americans {{were the}} final team {{eliminated}} during a fatal-four-way {{match for the}} WWE Tag Team Championship. Swagger blamed Cesaro for the loss and put Cesaro in the Patriot Lock before Colter demanded that the duo shake hands. Cesaro instead retaliated with a Cesaro <b>Swing</b> <b>on</b> Swagger. Later during the pay-per-view, Cesaro was a surprise entrant in the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, which he won by last eliminating Big Show by body slamming {{him out of the}} ring, which mirrored Hulk Hogan's momentous body slam of André. Swagger retaliated by attacking Cesaro on the following Raw and then destroying the trophy, thus ending the stable.|$|E
5|$|God of War is a third-person single player action-adventure {{video game}} with hack and slash elements, viewed from a fixed camera perspective. The player {{controls}} the character Kratos in combo-based combat, platforming, and puzzle game elements, and battles foes who primarily stem from Greek mythology, including undead soldiers, harpies, minotaurs, Medusa and her Gorgons, cyclopes, wraiths, Sirens, satyrs, centaurs, cerberuses, and boss opponents—the Hydra {{and a giant}} minotaur known as Pandora's Guardian. Platforming elements require the player to climb walls and ladders, jump across chasms, <b>swing</b> <b>on</b> ropes, and balance across beams to proceed through sections of the game. Some puzzles are simple, such as moving a box so that the player can {{use it as a}} jumping-off point to access a pathway unreachable with normal jumping, but others are more complex, such as finding several items across different areas of the game to unlock one door.|$|E
5|$|God of War: Chains of Olympus is a third-person single-player {{video game}} viewed from a fixed camera perspective.

Morpheus beasts, shades, banshees, fire guards, fire sentries, hyperion guards, and death knights were created {{specifically for the}} game.

5|$|What makes Yoshi's Island DS {{different}} is {{the addition of}} five babies for Yoshi to carry, each bestowing a different ability — Baby Mario allows Yoshi to dash and makes special 'M' blocks appear, and can grab Super Stars to become Super Baby Mario, and grants ricocheting eggs; Baby Peach allows Yoshi to float and fly on wind currents and grants a more forgiving timing to use Yoshi's flutter jumping abilities effectively; Baby Donkey Kong can grab and <b>swing</b> <b>on</b> vines and ropes, grants a special dash attack, allows Yoshi's eggs to explode as per Yoshi's Story (but they do so on impact) and allows Yoshi to push objects faster; Baby Wario uses his magnet to attract metal objects and allows Yoshi's eggs to bounce; and Baby Bowser spits fireballs, but the Yoshi carrying him cannot make eggs, though the eggs Yoshi already carries can bounce. The last three babies tend to make the timing for Yoshi's flutter jumping less forgiving and slow down his movement a little bit. The need to switch babies at key points adds a puzzle element to the game.|$|E
25|$|The Riverland-based {{district}} of Chaffey {{was the only}} seat held by Nationals SA. River Murray Minister Karlene Maywald easily defeated Liberal Anna Baric.

25|$|A door is {{a moving}} {{mechanism}} used to block off, and allow access to, an entrance to or within an enclosed space, {{such as a}} building, room or vehicle. Doors normally consist {{of one or two}} solid panels, with or without windows, that <b>swing</b> <b>on</b> hinges horizontally. These hinges are attached to the door's edge but there are also doors that slide, fold or spin. The main purpose of a door is to control physical access.|$|E

25|$|On September 5, 2013, Chamberlain was ejected for {{the second}} time in his major league career in a 9–8 Yankees loss against the Red Sox.

25|$|During the 2008 Test {{series against}} Australia in India, Ishant {{was the leading}} wicket-taker, with 16, and was named man-of-the-series as India won 2–0. He thereby became the first Indian paceman to win such an award in a Test series on Indian soil after Kapil Dev who won the award in 1983. He was noted for {{achieving}} reverse <b>swing</b> <b>on</b> balls sometimes as young as eight overs, and along with senior opening bowler Zaheer Khan, troubled the touring Australians. He took Australian captain Ricky Ponting's wicket three times during the series, and six times in as many Tests, making the Indian press label Ponting as Ishant's bunny.|$|E
25|$|To {{control their}} Sackboy character, the player moves {{by using the}} {{analogue}} sticks, jump {{with varying degrees of}} height depending on the pressure applied to the action button, and grab onto objects to either move or <b>swing</b> <b>on</b> them. In addition to regular left-and-right movement, and despite the 2D look of the game, levels consist of three levels of depth—the foreground, middleground and background—and may be traversed between either automatically by the game itself, or by the player's command. The player can opt to emote their Sackboy by applying varying degrees of delight, fear, sadness, and rage, control each arm independently through the analogue sticks, slap other players by jerking the arm movement with the analogue sticks, and use the Sixaxis motion-sensing functionality to animate the character's head and body.|$|E

25|$|Holt {{retained}} his portfolios in the Fadden Government, {{which lasted}} only 40 days before being defeated on a confidence motion in October 1941. After going into opposition, {{he kept a}} reasonably low profile {{for the remainder of}} the war, except for his membership of the Joint Committee on War Expenditure. He was criticised by some for not re-joining the army, and at the 1943 election was opposed by Brigadier William Cremor, whose campaign was funded by Sydney businessmen (including Keith Murdoch). He lost a significant portion of his primary vote, but suffered only a small <b>swing</b> <b>on</b> the two-party-preferred count. Menzies returned as leader of the UAP in September 1943, and Holt was initially a candidate for the deputy leadership; he withdrew once former prime minister Billy Hughes entered the race. Holt was in favour of the creation of the Liberal Party, but played little role in the practical aspects of its establishment. He became an official member of the new party in February 1945.|$|E
25|$|It first flew in 1951, and {{although}} 200 units were planned, only 65 were ever built. The Hispano engine was an upright V12 {{in contrast to}} the inverted V12 Daimler-Benz DB 601 & 605 engines used in the Bf 109. Being of compact design, it fitted the airframe of the Bf 109 well, representing it in the German 1957 film Der Stern von Afrika (The Star of Africa) about Luftwaffe ace Hans-Joachim Marseille. In the original design, an asymmetric vertical fin with an airfoiled profile had been introduced starting with the Bf 109F to produce a slight left movement of the tail, which counteracted the left-side torque reaction from the Daimler-Benz engine's counterclockwise rotation. Since this was left unchanged in the Buchón, and the Hispano V12 powered a clockwise-turning propeller instead, the combination of the airfoiled fin and the clockwise-turning propeller created a hard-to-counteract right <b>swing</b> <b>on</b> takeoff, since the fin and the propeller essentially worked in the same direction.|$|E
25|$|In Game 2, it was James Shields who got {{the start}} against C. J. Wilson. With runners on the corners in the 3rd inning, Shields went to 1st base for a pickoff attempt, but the throw over was errant, {{allowing}} the runner to score from 3rd base. Ian Kinsler launched a solo homer to left in the 4th, putting Texas up 2–0. In the 5th, Shields {{was removed from the}} game with two on and one out, being replaced by Chad Qualls to face Michael Young. With a 2–2 count, Young checked his <b>swing</b> <b>on</b> a pitch that was called a ball. The Rays appealed to first base umpire Jerry Meals, but Meals ruled that Young held up in time, drawing the ire of the Rays dugout. Replays showed that Young may not have checked in time, and had the ruling been made that he did not, it would have resulted in a strikeout. Instead, Young went deep to center on the very next pitch for a 3-run home run, putting the Rangers up 5–0. Rays manager Joe Maddon went out to the mound to talk to his pitcher after the home run, but began arguing with home plate umpire Jim Wolf about the check swing, which led to Wolf ejecting Maddon from the game. Texas added another run in the 6th inning, and held the Rays scoreless, winning 6–0 and taking a commanding 2–0 lead in the best-of-five series.|$|E
