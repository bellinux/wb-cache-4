40|$|This thesis {{researches}} {{to identify}} an alternative incentive system and {{determine whether it}} is feasible to implement it at the Turkish Naval <b>Shipyards.</b> The purpose of the incentive system would be to help the <b>shipyards</b> decrease cycle time and total cost, and increase productivity and readiness. This thesis also researches to determine the structural and statutory constraints {{to the implementation of}} such an incentive system. The thesis examined the current structure, routine processes, productivity, and compensation system at the Turkish Naval <b>Shipyards.</b> In this thesis, Arena Simulation Software is used to simulate and analyze the current overhaul process within the <b>shipyards.</b> The thesis also examined the alternative incentive systems that can be implemented at the <b>shipyards.</b> This thesis proposes a viable incentive system for the Turkish Naval <b>Shipyards.</b> NANATurkish Navy author...|$|R

5|$|After {{the war he}} {{returned}} to the Bureau of Ships, where he was involved with the development of nuclear propulsion. Mumma was promoted to rear admiral in 1954, and assumed command of the Mare Island Naval <b>Shipyard.</b> He became responsible for celebrating its 100th anniversary. However, his most important task was converting the <b>shipyard</b> over to the construction of nuclear submarines. In 1955 he became Chief of the Bureau of Ships, where he championed the adoption of the teardrop hull, and oversaw the design of nuclear submarines, cruisers and aircraft carriers.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{acquisition}} project organisers originally {{planned for the}} first submarine to be constructed overseas, the Cabinet decided {{as part of the}} project's approval that all six submarines would be built in Australia; the increases in construction time and cost from not building the lead ship in the winning designer's home <b>shipyard</b> was considered to be offset by the additional experience provided to Australian industries. Even so, two sections of the first submarine were constructed by Kockums' <b>shipyard</b> in Malmo, Sweden.|$|E
5|$|By 1916, {{thirteen}} German light cruisers {{had been}} lost in the course of World War I. To replace them, the Kaiserliche Marine ordered ten new cruisers built to a modified Königsberg class design. All ten ships were laid down in 1915 and 1916. Cöln was built by the Blohm & Voss <b>shipyard</b> in Bremen. Wiesbaden and Rostock were built at AG Vulcan in Stettin, and Leipzig, Ersatz Cöln, and Ersatz Emden were ordered from the AG Weser dockyard in Bremen. Dresden and Magdeburg were built at the Howaldtswerke <b>shipyard</b> in Kiel, while Frauenlob and Ersatz Karlsruhe were built by the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{was given}} her name by President George Washington after a {{principle}} of the United States Constitution. Her keel was reportedly laid down late in 1795 at a <b>shipyard</b> in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. James Hackett was charged with her construction and Captain James Sever served as a superintendent. Her construction proceeded slowly and was completely suspended when in March 1796, a peace treaty was signed with Algiers. Congress remained at the <b>shipyard,</b> incomplete, until relations with France deteriorated in 1798 with {{the start of the}} Quasi-War.

5|$|Despite {{estimates}} that Yorktown, damaged in the Battle of the Coral Sea, would require {{several months of}} repairs at Puget Sound Naval <b>Shipyard,</b> her elevators were intact and her flight deck largely so. The Pearl Harbor Naval <b>Shipyard</b> worked around the clock, and in 72 hours she was restored to a battle-ready state, judged good enough {{for two or three}} weeks of operations, as Nimitz required. Her flight deck was patched, and whole sections of internal frames were cut out and replaced. Repairs continued even as she sortied, with work crews from the repair ship , herself damaged in the attack on Pearl Harbor six months earlier, still aboard.|$|E
5|$|Entering the Norfolk Naval <b>Shipyard</b> on 11 June, Wisconsin {{underwent}} a brief overhaul and commenced a midshipman training cruise on 12 July. After revisiting Greenock, Brest, and Guantánamo Bay, the ship {{returned to the}} Norfolk Naval <b>Shipyard</b> for repairs. Shortly thereafter, Wisconsin participated in Atlantic Fleet exercises as flagship for Commander, Second Fleet. Departing Norfolk in January 1955, Wisconsin took part in Operation Springboard, during which time she visited Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Then, upon returning to Norfolk, the battleship conducted another midshipman's cruise that summer, visiting Edinburgh; Copenhagen, Denmark; and Guantánamo Bay {{before returning to the}} United States.|$|E

5|$|From {{early in}} his career, Wałęsa was {{interested}} in workers' concerns; in 1968 he encouraged <b>shipyard</b> colleagues to boycott official rallies that condemned recent student strikes. He was a charismatic leader, who helped organize the illegal 1970 protests at the Gdańsk <b>Shipyard</b> when workers protested the government's decree raising food prices and he was considered for the position of chairman of the strike committee. The strikes' outcome, which involved the deaths of over 30 workers, galvanized Wałęsa's views {{on the need for}} change. In June 1976, Wałęsa lost his job at the Gdańsk <b>Shipyard</b> because of his continued involvement in illegal unions, strikes, and a campaign to commemorate the victims of the 1970 protests. Afterwards he worked as an electrician for several other companies but his activism led to him continually being laid off and he was jobless for long periods. Wałęsa and his family were under constant surveillance by the Polish secret police; his home and workplace were always bugged. Over the next few years, he was arrested several times for participating in dissident activities.|$|E
