5|$|Northumberland, {{named after}} the {{ceremonial}} county, was ordered on 2 September 1861 from the Millwall Ironworks. She was laid down on 10 October 1861 at its shipyard in Millwall, London. She was altered while on the building slip after Sir Edward Reed succeeded Isaac Watts as Chief Constructor. Unlike her half-sisters, the ship spent five years on the stocks before {{she was ready to}} be launched, partially due to frequent changes in design, although Northumberland was much closer to completion. The additional weight caused her stick for an hour on the slipway before <b>she</b> <b>slid</b> halfway down with her stern only supported by air, threatening to buckle the ship. Efforts by hydraulic jacks and tugboats failed to get her into the water on the next spring tide failed, but the use of pontoons on 17 April 1866 proved successful. Her builders went into bankruptcy while the ship was being launched and the liquidators seized Northumberland as a company asset once she was in the water. Eight months passed before the Admiralty could take possession and begin fitting out the ship. She was commissioned in October 1868 and completed on 8 October for a cost a total of £444,256.|$|E
25|$|By {{act of the}} Territorial Legislature, the vessel's {{official}} name was to be Lot Whitcomb of Oregon. She was launched on December 25, 1850 with a general celebration. Present for speeches and vote-getting were Oregon's territorial governor, John P. Gaines and Mayor Kilbourne of Milwaukie. The U.S. Army brass band from Fort Vancouver played patriotic tunes, and at 3:00 p.m. that day, the props were knocked out and <b>she</b> <b>slid</b> down the ways into the Willamette River. Unfortunately a tragic accident marred the celebration. Frederick Morse, captain of the schooner Merchantman, then loading lumber from Whitcomb's sawmill, had unloaded an old saluting cannon from his vessel, {{and was in the}} process of firing it when it burst. Shrapnel from the destroyed barrel flew through the air and hit Captain Morse in the neck, killing him instantly. No one else was hurt, and the celebration continued unabated for several days.|$|E
500|$|Jacques became {{pregnant}} in 1952, but worked {{though most of}} her pregnancy, appearing in the Players' revue The Bells of St Martins between August and November 1952: <b>she</b> <b>slid</b> down the table and did the splits at the end—something The Times thought was [...] "especially good", although The Manchester Guardian considered that she was [...] "monumental of person but surprisingly thin of voice". Le Mesurier reported that he was [...] "faintly relieved" [...] when the revue {{came to an end}} because of her exertions, added to which she appeared in the 27 episodes of the third series of Educating Archie between September 1952 and June 1953. She then directed—but did not appear in—the Players' Christmas pantomime of 1952, Babes in the Wood.|$|E

50|$|Le Joola {{remained}} capsized but afloat until around 3:00 pm, {{at which}} point <b>she</b> finally <b>slid</b> beneath the water's surface, taking with her those who were unable {{to get out of}} the ship.|$|R
60|$|With {{a humorous}} sadness Pierre {{measured}} the large {{remainder of the}} one only piece she had touched, and then would have spoken banteringly to her; but <b>she</b> had <b>slid</b> away into her own room.|$|R
500|$|After the momentous {{victory in}} the Battle of Stalingrad the Soviet troops {{proceeded}} to nationwide counter-offensives and Shanina on 2 April 1944 joined the 184th Rifle Division, where a separate female sniper platoon had been formed. Shanina was appointed a commander of that platoon. Three days later, southeast of Vitebsk, Shanina killed her first German soldier. In Shanina's own words, recorded by an anonymous author, her legs gave way after that first encounter and <b>she</b> <b>slid</b> down into the trench, saying, [...] "I've killed a man." [...] Concerned, the other women ran up saying, [...] "That was a fascist you finished off!" [...] Seven months later, Shanina wrote in her diary that she was now killing the enemy in cold blood and saw the meaning {{of her life in}} her actions. She wrote that if she had to do everything over again, she would still strive to enter the sniper academy and would go to the front again.|$|E
500|$|Titanic was {{subjected}} to extreme opposing forces– the flooded bow pulling her down while {{the air in the}} stern kept her to the surface– which were concentrated at one of the weakest points in the structure, the area of the engine room hatch. Shortly after the lights went out, the ship split apart. The submerged bow may have remained attached to the stern by the keel for a short time, pulling the stern to a high angle before separating and leaving the stern to float for a few minutes longer. The forward part of the stern would have flooded very rapidly, causing it to tilt and then settle briefly until sinking. The ship disappeared from view at 02:20, 2 hours and 40 minutes after striking the iceberg. Thayer reported that it rotated on the surface, [...] "gradually [...] her deck away from us, as though to hide from our sight the awful spectacle... Then, with the deadened noise of the bursting of her last few gallant bulkheads, <b>she</b> <b>slid</b> quietly away from us into the sea." ...|$|E
500|$|Mouton's 1982 season {{started with}} a big {{accident}} at the Monte Carlo Rally. On stage twelve {{in the small town}} Briançonnet in Provence, she missed a patch of ice and slid off the road, crashing into the stone wall of a large house at 110km/h (70mph). Mouton injured her knee while Pons suffered a concussion. She had been in third place, and had set the fastest time for the difficult Col de Turini mountain pass. The pair's injuries were not serious and Mouton went on to make her debut in the Swedish Rally. She was running third when <b>she</b> <b>slid</b> into a snow bank, and crashed into the Quattro of teammate Hannu Mikkola who had gone off at the same place. She eventually finished fifth. In Portugal, Mouton recorded 18 stage wins on her way to a clear victory ahead of Toyota's Per Eklund. She once admitted that to be competitive in the rally, she tried to think of the large crowds right {{by the side of the}} route as trees. At the Tour de Corse, she could not match the pace of the leaders and finished seventh. At the Acropolis Rally, Mouton won ahead of the Opel duo Walter Röhrl and Henri Toivonen, and closed to within 20 points of the championship leader Röhrl. The event was overshadowed by two serious accidents, one of which killed a spectator. Mouton had commented: [...] "I'm afraid that something might break in my car and I can no longer avoid hitting a spectator." ...|$|E
60|$|Bathsheba flung {{down the}} brush, crook, and empty hive, pulled the skirt {{of her dress}} tightly round her ankles in a {{tremendous}} flurry, and as well as <b>she</b> could <b>slid</b> down the ladder. By the time she reached the bottom Troy was there also, and he stooped {{to pick up the}} hive.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all. I {{will tell}} every word, {{straight}} out, Giles, if you wish. He said I was to encourage you. There. But I cannot obey him further to-day. Come, {{let us go}} now." [...] <b>She</b> gently <b>slid</b> her hand from his, and went {{in front of him}} out of the Abbey.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, what fun!" [...] he cried. [...] "What am I sitting on? Is {{this your}} room? How jolly!" [...] "There--sit there," [...] <b>she</b> commanded. Cowper <b>slid</b> once more.|$|R
2500|$|After {{passing the}} line of fire of the fortress' gun batteries, the cruiser was burning and {{severely}} damaged, but her captain still hoped {{he would be able to}} save his ship. At this point, however, Blücher entered the sights of Kommandørkaptein Anderssen as <b>she</b> <b>slid</b> past the torpedo battery at a range of only [...] The torpedoes the retired officer was aiming at the cruiser were 40-year-old Whitehead weapons of Austro-Hungarian manufacture. These torpedoes had been practice-launched well over 200 times before, but no one was certain if they would function or not. As Kommandørkaptein Anderssen pushed the firing mechanism, at approximately 04:30, the weapons turned out to work perfectly, first one and then another torpedo raced out of their underwater exit tunnels at [...] below the surface toward the burning warship. As Anderssen had overestimated the speed of his target slightly, the first torpedo hit near Blüchers forward turret (nicknamed [...] "Anton"), creating only inconsequential damage. With the second torpedo launch the aim was corrected and the torpedo struck Blücher amidships, hitting the same general area as the first 28cm shell. This caused catastrophic damage to the cruiser and blew open many of her bulkheads, allowing water to flood her decks while she was burning furiously. The third torpedo launcher was left loaded in case more ships were to follow close behind Blücher. After firing, the two other tubes were reloaded and readied for the next target.|$|E

50|$|Jacobellis {{failed to}} {{progress}} to the medal round of Snowboard Cross at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, as, {{early in her}} semifinal race, she landed badly during a jump, and to avoid a collision with another rider went through a gate, resulting in an automatic disqualification. <b>She</b> then <b>slid</b> off the course. She ended up 5th in the standings.|$|R
5000|$|The ship {{burst into}} flames, capsized, and sank in 45 feet of water. <b>She</b> later <b>slid</b> off the ledge, atop {{of which she}} had {{originally}} sunk, into 150 feet of water. She was stricken from the Naval Register on 27 October 1949. Her salvaged hulk was later sold {{to the government of}} American Samoa in a contract entered into on 21 October 1955.|$|R
60|$|Then, tucking {{her head}} in his breast, hiding her face, <b>she</b> timidly <b>slid</b> her hands along his sides, {{pressing}} softly, to find the contours of his figure. Softly her hands crept over the silky back of his waistcoat, under his coats, and as they stirred, his blood flushed up, and up again, with fire, till all Siegmund was hot blood, and his breast was one great ache.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>slid</b> {{gracefully}} to her feet, {{shook the}} cigarette ash from her clothes, {{and picked up}} her muff.|$|E
60|$|He slowly relaxed his clasp, and <b>she</b> <b>slid</b> {{down like}} rain to earth. But still he clung to her.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>slid</b> Cowper's Letters and Wuthering Heights {{out of the}} arm-chair, so that Clarissa {{was invited}} to sit there.|$|E
60|$|Eudena {{struck a}} spark and blew at it; it twinkled {{brighter}} and then--went out. At that she cast down flint and firestone and stared blankly. Then she sprang {{to her feet}} and scrambled a yard or so up the cliff above the ledge. How she hung on even for a moment I do not know, for the chalk was vertical and without grip for a monkey. In a couple of seconds <b>she</b> had <b>slid</b> back to the ledge again with bleeding hands.|$|R
50|$|While {{transporting}} a {{detachment of}} troops 23 February 1863, Kinsman struck a snag and sank in Berwick Bay near Brashear City, Louisiana. Despite being beached, <b>she</b> filled and <b>slid</b> off the steep bank into deep water where she sank near Brashear City. Six men were lost.|$|R
60|$|In {{a lovely}} {{springing}} leap, like a wind, the Mino was upon her, and had boxed her twice, very definitely, with a white, delicate fist. <b>She</b> sank and <b>slid</b> back, unquestioning. He walked after her, and cuffed her once or twice, leisurely, with sudden little blows of his magic white paws.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>slid</b> {{a look at}} him {{which might}} have meant nothing or meant much, so perfect its shy stolidity.|$|E
60|$|We {{exchanged}} no greetings. <b>She</b> <b>slid</b> {{from her}} saddle into my arms, {{and for one}} instant I held her.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>slid</b> in quietly, {{scarcely}} rippling {{the smooth}} {{surface of the}} tiny basin, and Carroll laid her on the beach.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose they}} are all in bed," [...] said Clyde, [...] "with the bedclothes pulled over their heads--that is, except one, and I suspect she is talking in her sleep. They were all here as usual, and Mr. Archibald thought he would break the spell by telling a fishing story. He {{told me he was}} going to try to speak against time; but it wasn't of any use. <b>She</b> just <b>slid</b> into the middle of his remarks as a duck slides into the water, and then she began an oration. I really believe she did not know that any one else was talking." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will remember. Yes, I will promise. Go now; the reverent Mother is advised of your coming. And {{report to}} me night and {{morning of the}} {{progress}} of the case.

6000|$|... "Well, not far," [...] said Breckon, with a {{provisional}} smile, {{and then he}} was frightened from his irony by her flinging aside her wraps and starting to her feet. Before he could scramble to his own, <b>she</b> had <b>slid</b> down the reeling promenade half to the guard, over which she seemed about to plunge. He hurled himself after her; he could not have done otherwise; and it was as much in a wild clutch for support as in a purpose to save her that he caught her in his arms and braced himself against the ship's slant. [...] "Where are you going? What are you trying to do?" [...] he shouted.|$|R
60|$|At {{the edge}} of the sea the {{creature}} paused and looked back at me. Then <b>she</b> <b>slid</b> sinuously into the surf.|$|E

6000|$|She {{began to}} talk of my adventures with David in the Gardens, and of some little things I have not {{mentioned}} here, that I may have done for her when I was in a wayward mood, and her voice was as soft as her muff. She had also an affecting way of pronouncing all her r's as w's, just as the fairies do. [...] "And so," [...] she said, [...] "as you would not come {{to me to be}} thanked, I have come to you to thank you." [...] Whereupon she thanked me most abominably. <b>She</b> also <b>slid</b> one of her hands out of the muff, and though she was smiling her eyes were wet.|$|R
5000|$|Inez (voiced by Annick Obonsawin) is a {{girl who}} has an {{excellent}} vocabulary, for which the others often tease her. She has shoulder-length brown hair and mostly wears a pink long-sleeved T-shirt with a yellow star on the front, teal shorts, a purple hooded vest, a pair of square glasses, and high blue boots. Despite being the youngest human member of the gang, she is the smartest one. Inez's biggest pet peeve is when Matt calls her [...] "Nezzie", though she is fine with Slider calling her that. When asked why by Matt, she replies, [...] "he's, different", implying that <b>she</b> likes <b>Slider.</b> Inez wears a Sherlock hat in season two, episode 212. Sometimes, she also does a headstand in her time of thinking.|$|R
