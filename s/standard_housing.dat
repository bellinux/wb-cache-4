5|$|The {{university}} currently houses 11,000 beds on-campus {{in eight}} different housing communities. Residence hall style suites {{are available in}} the Libra, Apollo, Hercules, Nike, and Neptune communities. All of the residence hall suites have bathrooms shared between 2 or 3 rooms as opposed to communal bathrooms. Apartment-style housing is available in the Academic Village (Nike and Hercules) communities, the Towers at Knights Plaza, the Lake Claire Courtyard Apartments Community, and NorthView. UCF also has 400 beds at the Rosen College Apartments Community, located on the Rosen College of Hospitality Management campus. The majority of all on campus housing is occupied by freshman, though The Towers at Knights Plaza house mainly upper-classmen, student athletes, and honors students. Residents of the Towers Communities and Rosen College Apartments sign annual contracts to rent their apartments for a full academic year (fall, spring, and summer), whereas residents of all other <b>standard</b> <b>housing</b> communities on the main campus sign academic contracts to rent their rooms only for one or two semesters at a time. Housing on the main campus typically fills to capacity well {{before the start of the}} Fall semester, and cannot accommodate everyone who applies.|$|E

500|$|While it was active, Cyclone Beti was {{responsible}} for 2 deaths and caused damage in Australia, New Caledonia, New Zealand, and Vanuatu. The most significant damage occurred in New Caledonia where wind and flooding destroyed crops, gardens and caused disruption to the electricity network, water supply, road and telephone communications. Many homes and roads were also badly damaged, with over 50% of lower <b>standard</b> <b>housing</b> {{on the outskirts of}} Noumea damaged after rivers and creeks burst their banks. Press reports indicated that Beti inflicted between FF22- (US$4.3- [...] ) in damage to New Caledonia and that only a few injuries had occurred. Within Vanuatu, Beti caused about , (...) in damage to food gardens and shelters. As an extratropical cyclone, Beti generated a high surf and long period swells that hit both eastern Australia and New Zealand. Within Australia, the high surf left several competitors in the Australian life surfing championships injured, while another competitor was killed after his boat was swamped by large waves. Within New Zealand, Beti's remnants caused flooding and mud-slips, which led to several roads being closed. A helicopter and its pilot were lost {{at the height of the}} storm, while they were travelling from Napier to Gisborne.|$|E

2500|$|The State of California has {{proposed}} that all new low- and mid-rise residential buildings, and all new commercial buildings, be designed and constructed to ZNE standards beginning in 2020 and 2030, respectively. The requirements, if implemented, will be promulgated via the California Building Code, which is updated on a three-year cycle and which currently mandates {{some of the}} highest energy efficiency standards in the United States. California is anticipated to further increase efficiency requirements by 2020, thus avoiding the trends discussed above of building <b>standard</b> <b>housing</b> and achieving ZNE by adding large amounts of renewables. The California Energy Commission is required to perform a cost-benefit analysis to prove that new regulations create a net benefit for residents of the state. There has yet to be publicly released analysis of the impact that ZNE standards may have to construction, real estate, and energy prices in the state. Debate exists as to if the state's stringent efficiency requirements are directly responsible for the apparent [...] "flatlining" [...] of residential electricity use in the state since 1975. This debate is relevant to ZNE codes, as {{it remains to be seen}} via models or in practice what overall effect the proliferation of ZNE buildings will have on overall electricity use in the state, and at what cost.|$|E

40|$|Insight Homes {{constructed}} {{two houses}} in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, with identical floor plans and thermal envelopes but different heating and {{domestic hot water}} (DHW) systems. Each house is 1, 715 -ft 2 with a single story, three bedrooms, two bathrooms, and the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and ductwork located in conditioned crawlspaces. The <b>standard</b> <b>house,</b> which the builder offers as its <b>standard</b> production <b>house,</b> uses an {{air source heat pump}} (ASHP) with supplemental propane furnace heating. The Building America test house uses the same ASHP unit with supplemental heat provided by the DHW heater (a combined DHW and hydronic heating system, where the hydronic heating element is in the air handler). Both houses were occupied during the test period. Results indicate that efficiency of the two heating systems was not significantly different. Three issues dominate these results; lower system design performance resulting from the indoor refrigerant coil selected for the <b>standard</b> <b>house,</b> an incorrectly functioning defrost cycle in the <b>standard</b> <b>house,</b> and the low resolution of the natural gas monitoring equipment. The thermal comfort of both houses fell outside the ASHRAE Standard 55 heating range but was within the ACCA room-to-room temperature range when compared to the thermostat temperature. The monitored DHW draw schedules were input into EnergyPlus to evaluate the efficiency of the tankless hot water heater model using the two monitored profiles and the Building America House Simulation Protocols. The results indicate that the simulation is not significantly impacted by the draw profiles...|$|R
