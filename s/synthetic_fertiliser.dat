40|$|The {{question}} whether soil disturbance from mechanical weeding in organic systems affects nutrient release from organic matter in compost-amended soil was examined {{in a long-term}} organic-versus-conventional rotational cropping system experiment over three years. The experimental design included continuous snap beans, and a fully phased snap beans/fall rye crop rotation sequence. Treatments were combinations of yearly applied fertiliser (<b>synthetic</b> <b>fertiliser,</b> 1 × compost, 3 × compost) and weed control (herbicide, mechanical weeding). The 1 × compost rate was calculated to deliver the equivalent of 50 kg N ha- 1 : equal to the rate ofN in the <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> treatments. Ion exchange membranes were buried for 24 hours following mechanical weeding in bean plots. Adsorbed ions were then eluted and quantified. Available ammonium-nitrogen was not affected byweeding treatment, but nitrate-nitrogen was consistently less in mechanically weeded plots than in plots treated with herbicide. Principal component analysis of NH 4 -N, NO 3 -N, P, K, Ca and Mg availabilities showed distinct groupings of treatments according to fertility treatment rather than weeding treatment. The effect of cropping sequence on available nutrients was pronounced (P ≤ 0. 001) only in plots amended with synthetic fertilisers...|$|E
40|$|In Canada, stockless organic {{vegetable}} cropping systems may use compost for fertility. However, information to guide growers about when nutrients become {{available in the}} soil over the growing season is lacking. Detailed analysis of plant nutrient supply was conducted over {{three years in a}} multi-site rotations experiment using two cropping sequences. The experiment compared conventional fertility treatment (<b>synthetic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> (1 x N)) with organic treatments (annual compost amendment at a low (1 x N) and a high rate (3 x N)). Plant-available soil nutrients were captured using sequential two-week burials of ion exchange membranes. Ions were eluted and quantified. Variation in nutrient supply over time, and effects attributable to crop rotation and fertility regime were evaluated with analysis of variance and of principal components. Results showed season-long supply of plant nutrients was more affected by year than fertility regime or rotation, even in composted plots where large residual effects were expected. <b>Synthetic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> and 1 x compost resulted in very similar seasonal plant nutrient supplies. While 3 x compost caused some significant changes, the gains in plant nutrient supply was modest enough to suggest little or no advantage in this one respect to warrant the cost of amending at greater than the 1 x rate...|$|E

40|$|AbstractApplication of {{synthetic}} (N) fertiliser (such as urea) and incorporation of crop residues into soil result in nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions. Similarly, application of urea and lime {{to the soil}} results in carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. Greenhouse gases (GHGs) emanating from application of <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertiliser,</b> lime and crop residues retained in the field after harvest during field crop production in South Africa were calculated in this study. The objective was to establish GHG profiles of the field crops in South Africa that can inform national mitigation plans that are currently lacking details regarding the agriculture sector. The calculations used Agriculture and Land Use National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Software {{which is based on}} the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Guidelines for National GHG Inventory. GHG emissions were calculated and compared among different crop production and management practices. It is estimated that production of field crops resulted in a total of 5. 2 million tonnes of CO 2 equivalent (CO 2 -eq) emissions in South Africa in 2012. Application of <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> contributes the highest emissions with 57 % of national total crop CO 2 -eq emissions, followed by addition of lime (30 %) and crop residues retained in the field (13 %). Production of cereal crops accounts for 68 % of national total field crops’ GHG emissions followed by other field crops (14 %), legumes and oilseeds (11 %) and vegetables (7 %). Cultivations of maize, wheat and sugarcane result in highest commodity emissions. Highest GHGs per area planted were from the production of tomatoes with 1. 65 t of CO 2 -eqha− 1.

We simulated the effects of improved nutrient management on N and P export by rivers in China in 2050 and the associated coastal eutrophication using the Global Nutrient Export from WaterSheds 2 (NEWS 2) model.

The results indicate that reducing inputs of synthetic fertilisers alone (IP and ISSM scenarios) may reduce river export of N and P by < 15 %.

This study focuses {{on the impact of}} production of Miscanthus pellets and briquettes, potentially used to satisfy renewable energy requirements in Ireland. The impact categories considered are particularly important when assessing bioenergy systems; global warming potential, acidification potential, eutrophication potential, and energy demand. The scope of the study incorporates Miscanthus cultivation, harvest, processing and transport to a biomass distributor. The aim of the research is to evaluate the effects of changes in keys variables on the overall {{environmental impact}}s of the system. The scenarios examined include replacement of synthetic fertilisers with biosolids, Miscanthus processing by pelleting and briquetting, and transport distances of 50 and 100 km. Results indicate that maintenance and processing of the Miscanthus crop have the most environmental impacts with transport having less of an effect. Replacing <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> with biosolids results in a reduction in global warming potential of 23 – 33 % and energy demand of 12 – 18 %, but raises both acidification and eutrophication potential by 290 – 400 % and 258 – 300 %, respectively. Pelleting of Miscanthus requires more energy than briquetting, hence has higher impacts in each category assessed. Increasing the transport distance from 50 to 100 km, results in a small increase in each impact category. Miscanthus briquette production compares favourably with wood pellet, kerosene, and coal production, with Miscanthus pelleting proving more environmentally damaging...|$|E

To explore these interactions, complete N budgets were estimated for two contrasting hydrological catchments (dominated by agricultural grassland vs. semi-natural peat-dominated moorland), forming part of an intensively studied landscape in southern Scotland. Local scale atmospheric dispersion modelling and detailed farm and field inventories provided high resolution estimations of input fluxes. Direct agricultural inputs (i. e. grazing excreta, N 2 fixation, organic and <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertiliser)</b> accounted {{for most of the}} catchment N inputs, representing 82 % in the grassland and 62 % in the moorland catchment, while atmospheric deposition made a significant contribution, particularly in the moorland catchment, contributing 38 % of the N inputs. The estimated catchment N budgets highlighted areas of key uncertainty, particularly N 2 exchange and stream N export. The resulting N balances suggest that the study catchments have a limited capacity to store N within soils, vegetation and groundwater. The "catchment N retention", i. e. the amount of N which is either stored within the catchment or lost through atmospheric emissions, was estimated to be 13 % of the net anthropogenic input in the moorland and 61 % in the grassland catchment. These values contrast with regional scale estimates: Catchment retentions of net anthropogenic input estimated within Europe at the regional scale range from 50 % to 90 %, with an average of 82 % (Billen et al., 2011).

Organic farming does not use <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilisers.</b> A total conversion to organic farming would thus result in cutting all GHG emissions generated by the manufacture of <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilisers,</b> their transport, application and emissions from the soil. Besides, since organic farming usually results in the sequestration of carbon in the soil, its wide adoption would provide a substantial carbon sink in the soil. In the case of Croatia, a total conversion to organic farming would decrease GHG emissions arising from farming and farm-upstream linked sectors by 72 percent as compared to the present situation. A total conversion to organic farming in the UK would reduce the environmental and health costs generated by GHG by approximately 60 percent, while the external costs of a food basket (assuming also the use of environmentally-friendly means of transport) would fall tenfold. Finally, by adopting a full-scale conversion to organic farming, the EU- 27 would {{seem to be able to}} cut its GHG emissions by 5. 6 percent. This is exactly as much as the current gap in reaching the GHG reduction policy target, which EU- 27 will not be able to bridge even by implementing all its planned policies and by employing best available technological means presently known. ...|$|R
40|$|The loss of {{semi-natural}} grasslands in Europe, largely though ploughing/reseeding and <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> inputs, {{has caused}} a severe reduction in the diversity and abundance of grassland macrofungi. Of these, it is the colourful members of the genus Hygrocybe spp. (waxcaps) that have received most conservation attention, with current management prescriptions recommending the avoidance of fertiliser additions and maintenance of a short sward. However, the latter recommendation is based solely on empirical observations and {{is at odds with}} management strategies aimed at the conservation of many other groups of biota. In order to test the effect of sward height on macrofungal fruiting, a field experiment was established at a grassland site known to contain diverse populations (> 50 species) of grassland fungi. Replicated 80 m(2) plots (n = 5) were subjected to mowing at 3 cm or 8 cm either from May or July onwards, as well as a late haycut to 3 cm in September or no mowing at all. Macrofungal fruitbodies were counted in fortnightly surveys during the autumn. Species richness and fruitbody numbers were greatest on plots mown to 3 cm, either continually or following a July haycut, with hardly any fruitbodies formed on uncut plots. Panaeolus acuminatus and Entoloma conferendum showed atypical responses, fruiting most prolifically on 8 cm-cut and September-cut plots respectively. Thus haycutting followed by maintenance of a short sward, a regime also compatible with maintaining diversity of many grassland plants and invertebrates, is conducive to abundant fruiting of diverse grassland fungi. The formation of fruitbodies is important for wider appreciation of these fungi and useful for their routine monitoring but further information about below-ground mycelial dynamics is urgently required.

However, animal production is implicated in human health issues (diet-related diseases, zoonosis, antimicrobial resistance) and environmental burdens (ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions, eutrophication of surface waters, biodiversity loss). This paper reviews changes in global animal production and associated nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) flows {{over the past}} 50 years, during which time total animal production roughly tripled. Cattle still dominate {{the world in terms}} of animal biomass, but the number and total production of pigs and poultry have increased faster. Animal {{production systems}} are highly diverse and respond to changes in markets. Specialised systems have become more dominant, especially in developed and rapidly developing countries. The annual production of N and P in manure is similar to the amounts of N and P in <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> produced annually, but manure nutrients are often not recycled effectively and used efficiently by plants. Nutrient losses greatly depend on the system, management and regulations. Nitrogen and P use efficiency (NUE and PUE respectively) at the animal level is in the range 5 - 45 %, depending on animal category, feeding and management. NUE of mixed crop-animal systems may range from 5 % to 65 % depending on NUE at the animal level, and the utilisation of manure nitrogen and new nitrogen inputs. Potentially, values for PUE are higher than those for NUE. Solutions for improving NUE and PUE in animal production are based on a coherent set of activities in the whole chain of 'feed production-animal production-manure management'. A high efficiency at the system level is achieved through combination of high NUE and PUE at the animal level and effective recycling and utilisation of manure N and P in crop production. Specific regional regulations (low-emission manure storage and application, proper application limits and timing) greatly contribute to high efficiency at a system level...|$|E
40|$|In this {{experiment}} we study {{the effects of}} various culturing methods of plant based foods on health and fertility parameters in a two-generation study in rats. The organic method of growing plants without pesticides and <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> will be compared to a conventional method of growing plants (using pesticides and artificial fertiliser). The diets have been supplemented with minerals and vitamins according to the recommendations of the National Research Council for rats (1995), in order to avoid deficiencies. A control group is fed with a standard breeding chow for rodents. Two inbred rat strains have been selected:  the BN/hsdCpb which is characterised by a relatively low fertility and the GK/mol, a model susceptible for the development of non-insulin dependant diabetes (diabetes type II). One of the hypotheses for decreasing fertility and increasing frequency of testis cancer in humans in denmark, could be the use of certain pesticides.   However changes in type and amount of fertiliser may affect plant composition, and thus the efficiency of the preventive effect of plant foods on ex. cancer. With this study we hope to throw more light on a possible direct causal relationship between the type of diet and fertility parameters. While many different food components and contaminants show effects at high doses in single factor experiment, it is impossible to predict the combined effect of differences in low doses. This study hopes to provide answers to this, by showing if different ways of growing plants will result in differences in selected aspects of rat health. The results will thus provide a baseline for subsequent work to elucidate the relative importance of the different factors involved. Several preference tests with different animal species show that animals often have a preference for organically grown food. Whether this preference indicates some nutritional benefits, that will increase health and fertility of the animals, is however not well documented.

40|$|The fate of {{nitrogen}} (N) applied in biosolids {{was investigated in}} a forage production system on an alluvial clay loam soil in south-eastern Queensland, Australia. Biosolids were applied in October 2002 at rates of 6, 12, 36, and 54 dryt/ha for aerobically digested biosolids (AE) and 8, 16, 48, and 72 dryt/ha for anaerobically digested biosolids (AN). Rates were based on multiples of the Nitrogen Limited Biosolids Application rate (0. 5, 1, 3, and 4. 5 NLBAR) {{for each type of}} biosolid. The experiment included an unfertilised control and a fertilised control that received multiple applications of <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertiliser.</b> Forage sorghum was planted 1 week after biosolids application and harvested 4 times between December 2002 and May 2003. Dry matter production was significantly greater from the biosolids-treated plots (21 - 27 t/ha) than from the unfertilised (16 t/ha) and fertilised (18 t/ha) controls. The harvested plant material removed an extra 148 - 488 kg N from the biosolids-treated plots. Partial N budgets were calculated for the 1 NLBAR and 4. 5 NLBAR treatments for each biosolids type {{at the end of the}} crop season. Crop removal only accounted for 25 - 33 % of the applied N in the 1 NLBAR treatments and as low as 8 - 15 % with 4. 5 NLBAR. Residual biosolids N was predominantly in the form of organic N (38 - 51 % of applied biosolids N), although there was also a significant proportion (10 - 23 %) as NO 3 -N, predominantly in the top 0. 90 m of the soil profile. From 12 to 29 % of applied N was unaccounted for, and presumed to be lost as gaseous nitrogen and/or ammonia, as a consequence of volatilisation or denitrification, respectively. In-season mineralisation of organic N in biosolids was 43 - 59 % of the applied organic N, which was much greater than the 15 % (AN) - 25 % (AE) expected, based on current NLBAR calculation methods. Excessive biosolids application produced little additional biomass but led to high soil mineral N concentrations that were vulnerable to multiple loss pathways. Queensland Guidelines need to account for higher rates of mineralisation and losses via denitrification and volatilisation and should therefore encourage lower application rates to achieve optimal plant growth and minimise the potential for detrimental impacts on the environment...|$|E
40|$|Maize is {{a staple}} crop and underpins food {{security}} for Zambia. Maize productivity in Zambia is {{almost half the}} potential due to low uptake of conservation agricultural practices. This study tests the hypothesis of the trade-offs between agriculture productivity and long-term ecosystem services (ES) provision among maize farmers practising conventional agriculture on the one hand, and those practising conservation agriculture on the other hand, in Kafue district, Zambia. In addition, challenges which affect conservation agriculture uptake are assessed. Besides these challenges, the study notes that adoption of a new technology is also influenced by its efficiency, and therefore technical efficiency scores were estimated using the Stochastic Frontier Approach (SFA) to compare efficiency levels of the two agricultural systems. Kafue was purposefully selected as it is among the first districts where conservation agriculture was introduced. Through purposive and random sampling, the households surveyed were split into two distinct groups namely conservation agriculture (CA) farmers (treatment group) and conventional agriculture (CV) farmers (control group). The analysis significantly shows that farmers practicing CA have more knowledge than CV farmers about the capacity of conservation agriculture to reduce soil erosion, increase soil fertility, retain nutrients, mitigate pests and weeds and increase crop yield. However, both farming groups knew that CA helps conserve soils and that soil maintenance is important for food production. On the other hand, significantly, CV farmers knew more than CA farmers that CV reduces crop yield and increases soil erosion. On the other hand, CV farmers expressed {{a higher level of}} willingness to adopt CA practices than CA farmers who are unwilling to expand their area under CA. The study further shows that at least 55 % of farmers practicing CA find inadequate labour to be the main challenge faced in CA. It appears that a policy that improves the farmers' knowledge on CA would help improve the uptake of CA. CA farmers were significantly more knowledgeable than CV farmers about the detrimental effects of CV, such as increasing air and water pollution, thus raising the need for training among CV farmers with emphasis on the effects of their farming system on the environment which affect the supply of ecosystem services. Efficiency is also a means of improving productivity hence the Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) was employed to estimate technical efficiency levels in maize production. Using SFA, the study found that the technical efficiency of maize among CV farmers is 71. 3 % on average while that of CA farmers is 57. 9 % on average. Moreover, the study found that {{there was a significant difference}} (t= 3. 9854, P= 0. 0002) in the technical efficiency scores of the both CV and CA farmers. Nevertheless, the study also found that 77 % of output variation among CA farmers can be explained by variation in technical efficiency. However, 33. 4 % of total maize output can be explained by variation in technical efficiency among CV farmers. This means that CA farmers have a higher potential to increase their current output than CV farmers. Finally there was no significant difference in fertiliser usage between CA and CV farmers (t= 1. 3825, P= 0. 1700). Further, from SFA fertiliser responsiveness to maize output showed that a 1 % increase in the use of <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> leads to 0. 678 % and 0 % increase in maize output per hectare for CA and CV respectively at both 1 % and 10 % level of significance at the expense of water and air quality. Therefore, it can be concluded that there is a higher trade-off between maize production and water and air quality under conventional than under conservation agriculture.

40|$|To {{assess the}} effects of a {{hypothetical}} widespread adoption of organic practices in Denmark, a four-region, partial equilibrium model of the Danish agricultural sector, the Danish Organic Agriculture Project (DOAP), was constructed for the Danish Institute of Agricultural and Fisheries Economics (SJFI). DOAP contains 3 farm sectors, crops, dairy and pigs, and permits farmers to have up to 16 cropping activities. Detailed costs of production are modelled in each sector and region. DOAP contains two production structures, one conventional and one organic, currently representing less than 2 per cent of Danish farms. By exogenously specifying the number of farms using each method of production, the impact of a switch to organic methods on national outputs and farm returns can be estimated. SJFI survey data indicate that conventional and organic dairy farms differ in their physical and financial structure. Most obviously, <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertiliser</b> and pesticide use is minimal on Danish organic farms. What is registered under this heading presumably falls into categories allowed by the national organic standards. The use of certain other inputs such as animal feed and labour is also lower on organic farms. Other input use, including manure and depreciation on machinery, is similar to that on conventional farms. On the output side yields on organic farms in Denmark are lower than those on conventional farms, and thus farmers require a greater land area if they are to maintain per farm production. To maintain a given livestock output, a greater area in fodder production is required. Farmers respond by reducing their production of non-feed crops, such as wheat. At present, organic producers also grow less sugar beets and grass for seed, rapeseed and green peas because of agronomic constraints in the absence of pesticides and because of an absence of organic markets. Financial data indicate that existing organic dairy farmers can outperform conventional farmers. Lower production per hectare (through changes in yields and rotation) on the one hand, and lower production costs and higher output prices (mainly through premiums) on the other, result in favourable net farm income comparisons for farms under organic management. Estimates of organic crop and pig farms suggest a similar story, although yields there are lower and prices for the livestock enterprise are higher than on dairy farms. This performance is turned around over time, as premiums are estimated to fall with increased supply of organic products. This assumes that present conditions of marketing structures (for inputs and outputs) and technology are maintained at present levels. The main conclusion from the analysis of the model results is that primary agricultural sector income may stay the same, or rise slightly if less than 25 per cent of Danish farmers across all sectors adopted organic methods, but that considerable losses could accrue if a high percentage of farmers followed this approach (see Figure 1). It must be stressed that this estimate is valid under present conditions of input and output prices, level of tech-nology, and estimates in the crop and pig sector and future values. The slight initial gains occur because, according to the latest (1995 and 1996) SJFI survey data in the dairy sector and estimates in the crop and pig sector, organic producers - especially in the dairy sector which comprises half {{of the total number of}} organic farmers - are making greater profits than their conventional counterparts. This result of higher net returns per hectare does not hold as more and more farmers convert, because the organic price premiums that currently exist would be substantially or wholly eroded. Considerations of increased knowledge over time in organic management, possibilities in technological change, changes in combination of enterprises, sector and farm size, and especially increased efficiencies in the marketing of organic produce are not properly accounted for here. They are likely to enhance the financial position of organic producers to some extent. If age per se influences financial results, the difference in age between organic and conventional farmers would overestimate the relative financial position of organic farmers. The limitations of the data in the crop and pig sectors call for some caution in interpreting the results. Using the model enabled several factors to be identified as key variables determining costs, production and net returns. The rotational constraints, the yield reductions, subsidies and the existence of the price premium on organic products are main factors. Changes in input prices were not modelled, except where the inputs are outputs (for example fodder crops) used in the livestock enterprise. An exogenous drop in output prices (as can be expected in the organic market) is found to be significant in decreasing the gap between organic and conventional farms at higher rates of conversion. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Increasing {{the use of}} <b>synthetic</b> <b>fertilisers</b> and {{pesticides}} in agroecosystems has led to higher crop yields, accompanied by a decline in biodiversity at the levels of field, cropping system and farm. Biodiversity decline has been favoured by changes at landscape level such as regional farm specialisation, increases in field size, {{and the removal of}} hedgerows and woodlots. The loss of biodiversity in agro-ecosystems has increased the need for external inputs because beneficial functions are no longer provided by beneficial species as natural enemies of crop pests and ecosystem engineers. This trend has led to a strong reliance on petrochemicals in agroecosystems. However, many scientists have been arguing {{for more than two decades}} that this reliance on petrochemicals could be considerably reduced by a better use of biotic interactions.
