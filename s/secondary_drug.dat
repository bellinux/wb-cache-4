2500|$|From mid-1865 to 1867, Roebling {{worked with}} his father on the Cincinnati-Covington Bridge (now the John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge). While {{traveling}} in Europe to research wire mills, bridges and caisson foundations, his only son, John A. Roebling, II, was born. After returning in 1868, Washington became assistant engineer on the Brooklyn Bridge, and was named chief engineer after his father's death in mid-1869. He made several important improvements on the bridge design and further developed bridge building techniques. Thus, he designed the two large pneumatic caissons that became the foundations for the two towers. In 1870, fire broke out {{in one of the}} caissons; from within the caisson, Roebling directed the efforts to extinguish the flames. Working in compressed air in these caissons under the river caused him to get decompression sickness ("the bends") shattering his health and rendering him unable to visit the site, yet he continued to oversee the Brooklyn project to successful completion in 1883. Besides the bends, he may have had additional afflictions, possible neurasthenia, side effects of treatments, and <b>secondary</b> <b>drug</b> addiction. His wife, Emily Warren Roebling, who had taken it upon herself to learn bridge construction, became his nurse, companion, and confidant and took over much of the chief engineer's duties including day-to-day supervision and project management. [...] Although husband and wife jointly planned the bridge's continued construction, Emily successfully lobbied for formal retention of Washington as chief engineer. McCullough remarked that [...] "nowhere in the history of great undertakings is there anything comparable" [...] to Roebling conducting the largest and most difficult engineering project ever [...] "in absentia." ...|$|E

50|$|She quickly {{learns that}} she and several other nursing home {{residents}} had {{signed an agreement with}} Dr. Jimson and Dr. Reed to participate in a study for an experimental drug (PT-1) that reverses the effect of aging by making telomeres grow. All the residents at the nursing home had been given the drug and are now growing younger each day. However, because the drug is experimental, it must be kept a secret. While a second chance at life seems wonderful, when Amelia's first birthday while moving back in time arrives, she finds she cannot remember anything from the last year of her life when she was growing older. The residents realize that as they grow younger, their previous memories are disappearing and being rewritten with new memories from growing younger, even though the brain has plenty of chromosomes left for memory. It's then found out that it's like recording while hitting the rewind button.

40|$|FLT 3 is {{the most}} {{frequently}} mutated kinase in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Internal tandem duplications (ITDs) in the juxta-membrane region constitute the majority of activating FLT 3 mutations. Several FLT 3 kinase inhibitors were developed and tested in the clinic with significant success. However, recent studies have reported the development of <b>secondary</b> <b>drug</b> resistance in patients treated with FLT 3 inhibitors. Since FLT 3 -ITD is an HSP 90 client kinase, we here explored if targeting the stability of drug-resistant FLT 3 mutant protein could be a potential therapeutic option. We observed that HSP 90 inhibitor treatment resulted in the degradation of inhibitor-resistant FLT 3 -ITD mutants and selectively induced toxicity in cells expressing FLT 3 -ITD mutants. Thus, HSP 90 inhibitors provide a potential therapeutic choice to overcome <b>secondary</b> <b>drug</b> resistance following TKI treatment in FLT 3 -ITD positive AML...|$|E

Results BMP 7 was the only one with significantly increased expression at relapse in patients who developed secondary resistance.

Incubation of BMP 7 with MCL cell lines increased their resistance to bortezomib and cytarabine, while inhibition of BMP 7 expression by siRNA correlated with increased cell death linked to drug application.

40|$|The primary chemosensitivity of 16 highly {{malignant}} xenografted human soft-tissue sarcomas to ifosfamide, dacarbazine, adriamycin and cisplatin and {{the development}} of <b>secondary</b> <b>drug</b> resistance in two chemosensitive sarcoma cell lines was tested in the xenograft system. Single-dose, single-agent treatments with 350 mg kg- 1 ifosfamide, 200 mg kg- 1 dacarbazine, 10 mg kg- 1 doxorubicin and 6. 6 mg kg- 1 cisplatin were administered and response measured as specific growth delay. Since ifosfamide induced unexpectedly higher toxicity, response was corrected based on the shape of the dose-response curve for ifosfamide. Taking a specific growth delay > 3 as the cut-off point for chemosensitivity, ifosfamide, dacarbazine, doxorubicin and cisplatin were effective in 10 / 16, 4 / 16, 2 / 16 and 1 / 16 sarcoma cell lines respectively. Five out of 16 sarcoma cell lines were resistant to all tested drugs.

40|$|Background: In {{patients}} with {{ischemic heart disease}} (IHD), <b>secondary</b> preventive <b>drug</b> therapy improves overall prognosis. Therefore, this study evaluated cardiovascular drug utilization in patients suffering from IHD, identified factors influencing drug utilization, and determined the prevalence of shortfalls of antithrombotic, beta-blocker, and lipid-lowering drug use. Methods: This study is based on data recorded prospectively between 1996 and 1998 in two Swiss teaching hospitals for the SAS/CHDM pharmacoepidemiologic database project. Drug utilization was evaluated in all 987 monitored medical in{{patients with}} IHD. Results: At discharge, only 64 % of patients with IHD received platelet aggregation inhibitors, 42 % beta-blockers, and 26 % lipid-lowering <b>drugs.</b> <b>Secondary</b> preventive <b>drugs</b> were more frequently administered to patients with acute myocardial infarction and less frequently in the elderly. After including other co-factors, no gender difference could be detected.

Only {{about half of all}} patients with IHD and elevated cholesterol received lipid-lowering drugs. Conclusions: <b>Drugs</b> for <b>secondary</b> prevention are prescribed to the majority of patients with IHD.
