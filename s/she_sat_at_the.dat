500|$|Early in her career, her {{prominent}} {{breasts were}} considered problematic, {{and led to}} her losing her first professional assignment—an advertising campaign for General Electric that depicted young women in bathing suits relaxing around a pool. Emmeline Snively, head of the Blue Book Model Agency, sent her to photographer Gene Lester, which led to her short-lived assignment in the General Electric commercial. In 1954, she auditioned at both Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros. for a part in The Seven Year Itch, but failed to impress. She also auditioned at Paramount for Joan of Arc—a project that was never completed—and failed again. That year, she landed her first acting assignment in Lux Video Theatre, a series on CBS (An Angel Went AWOL, October 21, 1954). In the show, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> piano and delivered a few lines of dialogue for $300 ($ in [...] dollars).|$|E
2500|$|... {{reports that}} the Reubenite On son of Peleth joined Korah's conspiracy, but the text does not mention On again. Rav {{explained}} that On's wife saved him, arguing to him that no matter whether Moses or Korah prevailed, On would remain just a disciple. On replied that he had sworn to participate. So On's wife got him drunk with wine, and laid him down in their tent. Then <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> entrance of their tent and loosened her hair, so that whoever came to summon him saw her and retreated {{at the sight of}} her immodestly loosened hair. The Gemara taught that [...] refers to On's wife when it says: [...] "Every wise woman builds her house."–10a1.|$|E
60|$|She {{took the}} three-o'clock train {{back to the}} city. At nine <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> round table for dinner in the Café André. Nearly the same crowd was there.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> writing-table {{the hotel}} {{management}} had improvised for her.|$|R
60|$|John's eyes {{ran over}} her beauties, as with palpitating bosom and varying color <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> {{confused}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> unusual {{warmth of his}} language and manner.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> alone <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{table when}} he came out. She {{explained}} as she showed him his seat, [...] "Father and my aunt had breakfast long ago." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>SHE</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window {{watching}} the evening invade the avenue. Her head was {{leaned against the}} window curtains and in her nostrils was the odour of dusty cretonne. She was tired.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Oh, yes,' said I; 'she was {{pointing}} out those passes through which people {{go into the}} next county. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{other end of the}} table, didn't she? She was dressed in black.' ...|$|E
60|$|At length she thrust {{him from}} her and, taking {{him by the}} hand, {{led him to the}} seat beneath the elms, and bade him sit at one end of it, while <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> other.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not evident}} that Hetty quite {{understood}} him, for <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> fire with hands crossed in her lap, and Sewell turned to Tomlinson.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tiny bureau which filled one corner. When {{she looked}} round with the {{finished}} note Fleur was still touching the poppies with her gloved finger.|$|R
60|$|A smile, even, hovered on {{her mouth}} as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> breakfast-table, in the pretty negligee she had worn all night, and poured out Miss Lynde's coffee for her.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is there nothing,' he thought, {{glancing at}} her as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> head of the table, where her {{youthful}} figure, small and slight, but very graceful, looked as pretty as it looked misplaced; 'is there nothing that will move that face?' ...|$|E
60|$|The evening {{ended with}} dancing. On its being proposed, Anne offered her services, as usual; and though her eyes would {{sometimes}} fill with tears as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> instrument, she was extremely {{glad to be}} employed, and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved.|$|E
60|$|She sat in {{her room}} upstairs after the {{visitors}} had gone, thinking it over. The light was fading fast, and as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> open window the remembrance of Mr. Tredgold’s conduct helped to mar {{one of the most}} perfect evenings she had ever known.|$|E
60|$|She leant {{forward over}} the table, staring blankly. But {{presently}} her half-averted face began to haunt me as <b>she</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table, and {{her arm and}} the long droop of her shoulder.|$|R
60|$|He was not {{prepared}} for what followed. Euphrasia did not answer at once, but presently her knitting dropped to her lap, and <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> staring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> old clock on the kitchen shelf.|$|R
60|$|With {{the first}} break of dawn Juliette at last finally {{rose from her}} knees, bathed her burning eyes and head, tidied her hair and dress, then <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table, and began to write.|$|R
60|$|Jonas's {{exposition}} {{of the plan}} of his school was here interrupted by the farmer's wife, who, as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the settle towards the fire, had her face somewhat turned towards the window, and she saw a light at a distance near the horizon.|$|E
60|$|It was one day {{shortly before}} Jamie's return to Thrums that Jess saw Hendry pass {{the house and}} go down the brae when {{he ought to have}} come in to his brose. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window {{watching}} for him, and by and by he reappeared, carrying a parcel.|$|E
60|$|All this in French. Alvina, as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> piano, saw Max {{tall and}} blanched with anger; Ciccio with his neck stuck out, {{oblivious}} and convulsed with rage, stretching his neck at Max. All were in ordinary dress, but without coats, acting in their shirt-sleeves. Ciccio was clutching a property knife.|$|E
60|$|When <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pretty round table, {{arranged}} for two persons, Miss Panney was surprised <b>at</b> <b>the</b> scanty supply of eatables. There was the tea-tray, bread and butter, and some radishes. Her soul rose in anger.|$|R
60|$|Sir Patrick and Arnold {{both looked}} up. This time Blanche {{had heard the}} last words that had passed between them. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table by Sir Patrick's side, and laid her hand caressingly on his shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Tears {{are signs}} of gladness as well as grief; but those which coursed down Rose's face, as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> pensively <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window, still gazing in the same direction, seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy.|$|R
60|$|Violet, as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dinner-table, {{understood}} Lord Martindale's {{satisfaction in}} hearing John talking with animation; but she wondered at {{the chill of}} manner between her husband and his sister, and began to perceive that it was not, as she had supposed, merely in an occasional impatient word, that Arthur resented Theodora's neglect of her.|$|E
60|$|And when he {{came home}} at night, his heart relenting and growing hot for love of her, when he was just ready to feel he had been wrong, and when he was expecting her to feel the same, there <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sewing-machine, the whole house was covered with clipped calico, the kettle was not even on the fire.|$|E
60|$|They found them, {{and having}} {{shrouded}} the little {{window of the}} cabin, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table and very slowly but with much skill drew a plan, or rather a picture, of {{this portion of the}} Haarlem Mere. In that plan were marked many islands according to their natural shapes, twenty of them perhaps, and upon one of these she set a cross.|$|E
60|$|In the morning, after breakfast, <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window, {{with her}} {{knitting}} work in her hand, looking very thoughtful and sad. Presently {{she laid her}} work down in her lap, and seemed lost in some melancholy reverie.|$|R
6000|$|Gertrude said nothing; <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> dahlias and the currant-bushes in the garden, while Felix went on {{with his}} work. [...] "To 'enjoy,'" [...] she began at last, [...] "to take life--not painfully, must one do {{something}} wrong?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sat</b> staring <b>at</b> <b>the</b> great {{piece of}} glowing mineral which lay in her hand. Its surface was irregular; it had many faces; the subdued {{light from the}} window gave it the {{appearance}} of animated water. He {{felt it necessary to}} speak.|$|R
60|$|Next {{night the}} Woman cut great green armfuls of fresh grass from the water-meadows, and dried {{it before the}} fire, so that it smelt like new-mown hay, and <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mouth of the Cave and plaited a halter out of horse-hide, {{and she looked at}} the {{shoulder}} of mutton-bone--at the big broad blade-bone--and she made a Magic. She made the Second Singing Magic in the world.|$|E
60|$|Once {{more she}} placed the sheet of paper before her. Resting her head on her hand as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table, she tried to trace {{her way through the}} {{labyrinth}} of the past, beginning with the day when she had met Grace Roseberry in the French cottage, and ending with the day which had brought them face to face, for the second time, in the dining-room at Mablethorpe House.|$|E
6000|$|So Nathan, highly {{pleased with}} his office, {{collected}} the votes in his cap, and brought them up to his sister Mary. She looked them over as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window, the children all looking up from below, eagerly awaiting the result. At length, Mary told them that there were four leaves in Nathan's cap, and that {{three of them had}} the letter L upon it. [...] "So," [...] said she, [...] "you see you have chosen Lucy for regent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sit down," [...] he said, {{placing the}} candle on <b>the</b> mantelpiece. <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> table, {{and he stood}} on the hearthrug. [...] "Now," [...] said he, [...] "about the future. Are you coming back? Will you give <b>the</b> life <b>at</b> Holland Park another trial?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, mother, I haven't. I {{have refused}} him, {{and he is}} going away as soon as Mr. Maynard comes." [...] <b>She</b> <b>sat</b> looking <b>at</b> <b>the</b> window, and the tears stole into her eyes, and blurred the sea and sky {{together}} where she saw their meeting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> horizon line.|$|R
6000|$|... "I never thought," [...] said Mrs. Aleshine, as <b>she</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>at</b> <b>the</b> tea-pot, [...] "that the heathens {{had so many}} conveniences, {{specially}} bakin'-powders and Dutch ovens. For my part, I always {{supposed that}} they used their altars for bakin', when they wasn't offerin' up victims on 'em." ...|$|R
