500|$|Although the {{earliest}} Pipe roll dates from 1130, the 31st year of King Henry I's reign, {{it is clear}} that they were being produced by the Exchequer before then, as the 1130 roll is not an experiment. It shows no hesitancy in its use of accounts, or lack of continuity from previous years. An extract from an earlier Pipe roll, from the 25th regnal year of Henry I or 1124, has been found in a 14th-century manuscript now in the Cotton Library at the British Museum. [...] Exactly when the Pipe rolls began to be produced is debated amongst historians. Some hold that they date from Henry I's reign, whether early or late in the reign, but others feel that they were introduced by King William I (reigned 1066–1087). The precursors of the records probably date to the Anglo-Saxon period, as the historian Pauline Stafford argues that financial records must have been kept in some form during the reigns of Cnut (reigned 1016–1035), Æthelred II (reigned 978–1016), and Edgar the Peaceable (reigned 959–975). There is a reference to the king's [...] "rolls" [...] in a writ from 1110, which purports to be a grant from Henry I to the abbot of Westminster of ten shillings, but the writ may be a forgery, or parts of it may be genuine with some interpolations. As the writ only exists in a copy in a later cartulary, and the Abbey of Westminster is also known to have forged a number of other writs or charters, the writ is not a <b>solid</b> <b>source</b> for royal rolls being kept as early as 1110.|$|E

30|$|So far, {{a variety}} of {{synthesis}} approaches {{have been reported to}} grow large-area MoS 2 including liquid exfoliation (sonication in solvents) [8], two-step chemical vapor deposition (CVD, sulfurization or decomposition of pre-deposited Mo-based thin films) [9 – 11], one-step CVD (reaction of gaseous Mo and S precursors) [12 – 14], and physical vapor deposition (sputtering and pulsed laser deposition) [15, 16]. Special emphasis has been put on one-step CVD as it shows greater potential for growing uniform large-grain thin films of single-layer MoS 2. The most common one-step CVD is based on the reaction of gaseous MoO 3 and S evaporated from <b>solid</b> <b>sources</b> due to the simplicity of processing and the easy availability of <b>solid</b> <b>sources</b> [12]. When the optimized CVD process conditions with MoO 3 and S precursors are combined with the use of mica or substrate treatment, the formation of single-layer MoS 2 thin films can be obtained up to about a centimeter [17 – 19]. However, CVD processes based on MoO 3 and S powders typically result in triangular-shaped discontinuous clusters of either single-layer MoS 2 or mixtures of single- and few-layer MoS 2 [12]. Therefore, more work is needed to establish a CVD process that can reproducibly provide continuous large-area thin films of uniform single-layer MoS 2.|$|R
