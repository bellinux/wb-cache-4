5|$|Arboreal frogs have pads {{located on}} the ends of their toes to help grip {{vertical}} surfaces. These are not suction pads, the surface consisting instead of columnar cells with flat tops with small gaps between them lubricated by mucous glands. When the frog applies pressure, the cells adhere to irregularities on the surface and the grip is maintained through surface tension. This allows the frog to climb on smooth surfaces, but the <b>system</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> function efficiently when the pads are excessively wet.|$|E
5|$|Metro relies {{extensively}} on passenger fares and appropriated financing from the Maryland, Virginia, and Washington D.C. governments, which are represented on Metro's board of directors. The <b>system</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have a dedicated revenue stream as other cities' mass transit systems do. Critics allege {{that this has}} contributed to Metro's recent history of maintenance and safety problems.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} ACA nonprofit {{insurance}} cooperatives for 2017 fell from 23 originally to 7 for 2017. The remaining 7 posted annual losses in 2015. A General Accountability Report found that co-opsâ€™ 2015 premiums were generally below average. At {{the end of}} 2014, money co-ops and other ACA insurers had counted on risk corridor payments that didn't materialize. Maryland's Evergreen Health claims that ACA's risk-adjustment <b>system</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> adequately measure risk.|$|E
5|$|The Leaf's {{electric}} warning sound had to {{be removed}} for cars delivered in the U.K., as the country's law mandates that any hazard warning sound must be capable of being disabled between 11:00 pm and 6:00 am, and the Leaf's audible warning <b>system</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> allow for such temporary deactivation. For the 2014 UK model of the car, the VSP system is enabled by default, though a button on the dash permits drivers to disable the system until the next time the car is switched on.|$|E
5|$|The {{claims have}} been criticized for {{ignoring}} that the second law only applies to isolated systems. Organisms are open systems as they constantly exchange energy and matter with their environment: for example animals eat food and excrete waste, and radiate and absorb heat. It is argued that the Sun-Earth-space <b>system</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> violate the second law because the enormous increase in entropy due to the Sun and Earth radiating into space dwarfs the local decrease in entropy caused by the existence and evolution of self-organizing life.|$|E

It does not apply to free agents or to amateur players who have never played in NPB. Mac Suzuki, Micheal Nakamura, Kazuhito Tadano, and Junichi Tazawa are the only Japanese players to have debuted in MLB without having played in NPB. The <b>system</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> work in reverse; it does not regulate MLB players, such as Alex Cabrera, who moved to NPB.|$|E
5|$|The {{walls of}} the inner ward contain {{extensive}} first floor passageways, similar to those at Caernarfon Castle. These were intended to allow members of the castle to move between the towers, accessing the guardrooms, sleeping chambers and the castle latrines. The latrines were designed to be drained by a special system using {{the water from the}} moat, but the <b>system</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> appear to have worked well in practice. The six towers were intended to be three storeys high and contained fireplaces. The castle chapel was built into one of the towers and would have been used by the king and his family, rather than the wider garrison.|$|E
5|$|Two main {{clinical}} {{staging systems}} {{are used to}} classify HIV and HIV-related disease for surveillance purposes: the WHO disease staging system for HIV infection and disease, and the CDC classification system for HIV infection. The CDC's classification system is more frequently adopted in developed countries. Since the WHO's staging <b>system</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> require laboratory tests, {{it is suited to}} the resource-restricted conditions encountered in developing countries, where it {{can also be used to}} help guide clinical management. Despite their differences, the two systems allow comparison for statistical purposes.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{manufacturers}} {{claim that}} their electronic devices affect {{the interaction of}} minerals with water so that the minerals <b>do</b> <b>not</b> bind to surfaces. Since these <b>systems</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is {{the elimination of the}} need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have been claimed, such <b>systems</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only alter the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Examples are remediation of calcium scaling and remediation of salt crusts in soil.
