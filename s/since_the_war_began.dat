5|$|There was {{evidence}} that Braham's judgement was becoming impaired. He had not taken much leave <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>began</b> in 1939 and he admitted to becoming short-tempered {{with his family and}} those around him. He had spent much of the previous two years leading from the front and flying long and hazardous operations over enemy territory. On 7 May 1944 he collected navigator Flight Lieutenant Donald Walsh from Group headquarters. He borrowed a Mosquito from 21 Squadron at Gravesend. He flew to Norfolk to refuel and spent time with his old unit, 141 Squadron, and spent the night at West Raynham. Over Roskilde, Denmark, he caught a Ju 88 after a 10-minute chase and shot it down—his 28th victory. On 12 May Braham repeated the operation. This time he took Bill Gregory with him. Operating over the Aalborg–Copenhagen line he spotted a Fw 190 near Hurning. Giving chase Braham found himself under attack by a Bf 109—his presence clearly detected by German radar. His Mosquito was hit in the port wing and the fuel line were ruptured. The Bf 109 then disappeared. Ignoring the damage he closed on the Fw 190. At zero feet his Mosquito bounced off a mound but he managed to hit the enemy aircraft which burst into flames, stalled and crashed near Aalborg. The range was so close—around 100 yards—the Focke-Wulf nearly collided with Braham. The loss of fuel from the chase and damage coupled with his damaged propellers upon his collision with the ground, meant that the chances of reaching England were slim. He climbed to high altitude 70 miles from the coast and broadcast an emergency message which was received. He ditched the Mosquito which broke in half. They took the dingy and watched the tail and wings remain afloat. He was retrieved with Gregory by air-sea rescue. Royal Navy trawlers sank the sections of aircraft remaining afloat. Regardless of the venture, on 13 June 1944 he received his final award—a second bar to his DSO.|$|E

On August 27, the Council of Ministers held its first meeting at the Hôtel Matignon since 1940. In October, a provisional municipal council was established, but it did not formally meet until March and April 1945. The first issue of a new newspaper, Le Monde, was published on December 18, 1944. On April 13, 1945, just before the end of war, a new ordinance set the date for the first municipal elections <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>began.</b> They were held on 29 April, {{and for the first time}} French women were allowed to vote.|$|E

25|$|Brentford {{returned}} to the Football League South for the 1942–43 season with cause for optimism, having generated over £20,000 from the semi-finals and {{the final of the}} club's victorious 1941–42 London War Cup campaign. Again the first team squad would be hit by a lack of unavailability of players, with no goalkeeper available for the second season in succession. Despite averaging only 12 appearances per season <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>began,</b> centre forward Len Townsend had been averaging nearly a goal a game and was in fantastic form, scoring 17 goals in a 17 match spell, including six in a in a 9–4 victory over Brighton & Hove Albion on 12 September 1942. The record of six goals in a single match bettered the official club record of five, but due to the unofficial nature of wartime football, Townsend does not hold the club record outright.|$|E
25|$|Soon after, through sheer luck, {{the group}} find {{themselves}} perfectly positioned to attempt another {{attack on the}} Airfield.

There they encounter a tribe of feral (and hostile) children, who have been living on the streets and hiding from enemy troops <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>began.</b> The group rescue five of the children who have been captured by an enemy patrol and escape back to Hell. For a time the group looks after the children. During this time strained relationships are mended and the soul-destroying effects of the war are tempered by a chance to do something positive. However, this period does not last. A patrol ambushes the group near their base and after defeating their attackers in a prolonged firefight the group realises that they are no longer safe in Hell and make contact with New Zealand immediately.|$|E
25|$|By mid-January, tens of {{thousands}} of Russian soldiers had begun an advance on central Grozny from three directions. During this fighting, several suburbs and key buildings adjoining the city center changed hands several times. In a number of incidents, small bands of rebel fighters cut off exposed Russian units from the main forces. On January 19, in a major setback for the Russian forces, Chechen snipers killed one of the Russian commanders, Gen. Mikhail Malofeyev. Russian troops were unable to recover his body until five days later. Two days later, one Russian unit lost 20 men killed in north-west Grozny after the rebels made their way through sewage tunnels and attacked them from the rear. On January 26, the Russian government admitted that 1,173 servicemen had been killed in Chechnya <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>began</b> in October. This figure was more than twice the 544 dead reported 19 days earlier, on January 6, with just 300 dead reported on January 4, indicating heavy losses in the Grozny battles and elsewhere during this month (later, Russia claimed 368 servicemen were killed in the city).|$|E

He also praised the Iraqis' legislative achievements, including a pension law, a revised de-Baathification law, a new budget, an amnesty law, and a provincial powers measure that, he said, set the stage for the Iraqi elections. By July 2008, American troop deaths had reached their lowest number <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>began,</b> and due to increased stability in Iraq, Bush announced the withdrawal of additional American forces.|$|E

[...] In August 2006, he criticized the administration for continually understating the effectiveness of the insurgency: [...] "We [...] not told the American people how tough and difficult this could be." [...] From the beginning, McCain strongly supported the Iraq troop surge of 2007. The strategy's opponents labeled it [...] "McCain's plan" [...] and University of Virginia political science professor Larry Sabato said, [...] "McCain owns Iraq just as much as Bush does now." [...] The surge and the war were unpopular during most of the year, even within the Republican Party, as McCain's presidential campaign was underway; faced with the consequences, McCain frequently responded, [...] "I would much rather lose a campaign than a war." [...] In March 2008, McCain credited the surge strategy with reducing violence in Iraq, as he made his eighth trip to that country <b>since</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>began.</b>|$|E
