5|$|In Japan, a {{young girl}} nicknamed Gorgeous (Kimiko Ikegami) has plans for a summer {{vacation}} with her father (Saho Sasazawa) {{who had been in}} Italy scoring film music. Her father returns home and surprises Gorgeous by announcing she has a new stepmother, Ryoko Ema (Haruko Wanibuchi). This upsets Gorgeous as her mother had died years earlier. Gorgeous goes to her bedroom and writes a letter to her aunt asking if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> visit her this summer instead. Gorgeous' aunt replies and allows her to come visit. Gorgeous invites her six friends, Prof (Ai Matsubara), Melody (Eriko Tanaka), Kung Fu (Miki Jinbo), Mac (Mieko Sato), Sweet (Masayo Miyako) and Fantasy (Kumiko Oba) to come along with her. On arriving at the aunt's house, the girls are greeted by Gorgeous' aunt (Yōko Minamida) to whom they present a watermelon.|$|E

500|$|DeGeneres began {{dropping}} hints in {{the episodes}} {{leading up to}} [...] "The Puppy Episode" [...] that she was planning {{to come out in}} real life and have her character come out as well, including such sight gags as Ellen Morgan stumbling into an actual closet so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> out of it. She also invited comment with her off-screen actions, as when she kissed k.d. lang while presenting her with an award at a Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center function in early 1997. DeGeneres finally officially came out in Time magazine, with an April 14, 1997 cover emblazoned with the words, [...] "Yep, I'm Gay". She appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show with then-girlfriend Anne Heche the day [...] "The Puppy Episode" [...] was set to air.|$|E
60|$|But {{he always}} {{answered}} the wrong thing. And though she cudgelled her brains, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>come</b> at it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{left her}} in tears because <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>come.</b> <b>She</b> sent you so many {{confused}} messages that I'm afraid I've forgotten them." ...|$|R
60|$|Cecily {{now joined}} us. It {{appeared}} {{that it was}} Felicity's morning to help prepare breakfast, therefore <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>come.</b> We all went to Uncle Stephen's Walk.|$|R
500|$|In a hotel lobby, the {{concierge}} answers {{a phone call}} from a guest's room. A man (Jason Schwartzman) lies on a hotel bed in a yellow bathrobe, watching the black-and-white American war film Stalag 17 and reading the newspaper. After ordering room service from {{the concierge}} in broken French, he receives a call from a woman whose voice he recognizes. She tells him she is on her way from the airport and asks for his room number. Despite objecting that he did not tell her <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>come,</b> the man consents nevertheless. He then hurriedly attempts to tidy the room– pausing to play the opening bars of the song [...] "Where Do You Go To (My Lovely)?" [...] by Peter Sarstedt on his stereo system– and runs a bath.|$|E
500|$|When Madonna {{started writing}} {{the songs on}} the album, she was {{inspired}} by different situations, like having guitar lessons and getting an idea, or sometimes Ahmadzaï would send over a rough demo to her without the basic chord progression. The songs on American Life and their lyrics were developed like that. Explaining her writing process, Madonna told Q magazine that the [...] "music has to jar my brain in terms of lyrics. Sometimes I write free verse. I have a journal and I note down ideas I get from newspapers and books". Madonna also remembered Ahmadzaï's downbeat existentialism regarding the condition of society around them, and the long discussions they had into the night, which ultimately reflected into the songwriting as anxiety they felt in their heart. American Life was deemed {{by some as a}} concept album featuring political themes based around the United States, with Madonna explaining that she felt [...] "like America has changed over the years and that a lot of our values seem to be materially oriented and so superficial. And we all seem to be obsessed with fame {{just for the sake of}} fame, no matter what— sell your soul to the devil if that's what it takes. And we're also completely obsessed with the way we look." [...] Madonna recalled that even she had been through such trials and those musings came out in the writing of the first three songs, the title track, [...] "Hollywood" [...] and [...] "I'm So Stupid". John Norris from MTV described them as a trilogy, and an indicator of Madonna's reassessment of her life while discussing things she wishes to put behind her. Madonna partly agreed, saying that the tracks are extensions of one another, and portray her desire of giving importance to less noteworthy things, and how <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> out of that [...] "illusion". Madonna discussed the materialistic themes of the record and her personal encounters which have led to the composition with MTV saying: ...|$|E
2500|$|Captain Inman, of , was {{in charge}} of the operation. He sent , under Patrick Campbell, against the easternmost vessel, and loosed his four fireships, , , , and [...] against the westernmost vessels. Dart {{captured}} Désirée on 8 July. Even though their captains remained on the fireships until the four were engulfed in flames, the three frigates that were their targets cut their cables and escaped down the Inner Channel within the Braak Sand. There one briefly ran aground but her crew got her off again. Inman had kept Selby back, intending tthat if any French vessels ran aground <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> up and throw carcasses aboard them He stated that his plan had been an error in that if Selby had been forward he was sure that she could have captured that vessel.|$|E
60|$|She whipped her steed, she spurred her steed, Till {{his breast}} {{was all a}} foam; But nearer unto that tall young knight, By Our Ladye <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>come.</b>|$|R
60|$|So {{she wrote}} that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>come</b> home; Margaret was much disappointed, {{and so was}} Meta, who had looked to Ethel to unravel the tangles of her life.|$|R
60|$|In {{ten minutes}} from that time, Adam {{was at the}} door of the cell. Dinah had sent him word that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>come</b> to him; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not leave Hetty one moment; but Hetty was {{prepared}} for the meeting.|$|R
2500|$|On 23 August 2012, it was {{announced}} that the BBC had commissioned the six-part comedy Heading Out, which was created and written by Perkins. The BBC's Executive editor of Comedy Commissioning, Kristian Smith, called the show [...] "a warm, intelligent and brilliantly funny sitcom." [...] While Perkins stated that Heading Out [...] "might well be the thing that I'm most proud of. It's been a joy to work on, and I hope that joy proves to be infectious." [...] Perkins revealed that she had had the idea for Heading Out for ten years, before she developed the confidence to write it. She knew that she wanted to write about someone who was stuck and whose friends decided to take drastic action to [...] "save her from her own inertia." [...] The idea slowly began to take shape and developed into the narrative of a woman who struggled to tell her parents that she was gay, until her friends drove her to parent's house on her birthday, so <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> out to them. The comedian revealed that she is a fan of thrillers and wanted to have a ticking clock element to the show, so she thought Sara's coming out {{would be a good thing}} to do.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, in {{the next}} place, I could climb on to the river terrace at night, and perhaps <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> and speak to me there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'There {{are plenty}} of places. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> and live with us, and be my maid. If you would give her £50 for herself, she'd arrange it all.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is not a}} bad one," [...] she said; [...] "but {{what would}} the {{daughter}} do? <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>come</b> into town every day to do your work. It is too long a walk for her, and <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not afford a conveyance." ...|$|R
60|$|Now Willy was {{in another}} flutter. After the walk with the fur-trimmed coat, and the talk about dollars by {{thousands}} and tens of thousands, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>come</b> down to mention borax and blacking.|$|R
6000|$|She dressed {{herself as}} quick as <b>she</b> <b>could,</b> <b>came</b> down stairs, and {{proceeded}} to enter the queen regent's coach, saying {{that she wanted to}} have {{one or the other of}} certain seats--naming the best places--as she had no idea, she said, of being exposed to cold, or riding uncomfortably on such a night. The queen told her that those seats were for herself and another lady of high rank who was with her, to which Anne Maria replied, [...] "Oh, very well; I suppose young ladies ought to give up to old people." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah never, never! If {{it takes}} that {{to save her}} she must be lost. Besides, what good would it do? If I were to go above <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> below." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh! has he? but {{she lives}} so far off, and gets her letters so seldom, I don't reckon at all upon her coming. If <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> {{directly}} {{it would be}} a comfort.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, doesn't she!" [...] said Cecily, bitterly. [...] "She {{likes you}} {{better than she}} likes me for all I've--but it's no matter. It's been all my fault--she'll explain. Tell her I said <b>she</b> <b>could.</b> <b>Come</b> in, I say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} tell you what she said; indeed, {{it would not be}} right if I could; but she {{positively}} declined. She seemed to feel, that after all that had happened, <b>she</b> never <b>could</b> <b>come</b> to Greshamsbury again." ...|$|R
60|$|They did {{not wait}} {{long for the}} Crawfords, {{but there was no}} Mrs. Grant. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>come.</b> Dr. Grant, professing an indisposition, for which he had little credit with his fair sister-in-law, could not spare his wife.|$|R
60|$|After {{going on}} a little way beyond this, they began to {{approach}} the town of Aigle. Mrs. Holiday was surprised that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> have <b>come</b> so far with so little fatigue. Rollo told {{her that it was}} because she had walked along so slowly.|$|R
60|$|When {{could she}} {{undertake}} to commence her duties? When {{did they want}} her? The very moment <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>come.</b> She could begin tomorrow--but she had no uniform. Oh, the matron would lend her uniform and aprons, till her box arrived.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] murmured Leila, and {{her eyes}} looked very soft. [...] "Poor child! We shall be wanting an extra hand next week. I'll see if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> now. I'll speak to our Matron, and let you know to-night." [...] She {{squeezed}} his hand hard.|$|E
60|$|The {{people who}} had turned their heads turned them again as the service proceeded; and at last observing her, they whispered to each other. She knew what their whispers were about, grew sick at heart, and felt that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> to church no more.|$|E
60|$|Mops topped a wave astern and {{disappeared}} temporarily in the trough. It {{was a large}} wave, {{but it was no}} graybeard. A small boat could live easily in such a sea, and in such a sea the Mary Rogers <b>could</b> easily <b>come</b> to. But <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>come</b> to and make westing at the same time.|$|R
50|$|On {{the night}} of September 22, 1996 she had {{contacted}} her friend, dancer Anuradha, to discuss a matter that was disturbing her. Anuradha said <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>come</b> during the night, as her husband would be coming home shortly, but would meet her in the morning.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was hard}} to {{dissemble}} still, to tempt him to say something that would madden me! [...] "No, no," [...] I answered, after considering his words.

6000|$|... 'Mrs. Jim--I mean Lady Jim's in {{camp with}} him. At any rate, {{she says she}} will look after my sister. William wired down to her on her own responsibility, asking if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>come,</b> and knocked the ground from under me by showing me her answer.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, yes," [...] she assented, with a {{reluctance}} rather for the complicity {{in which he}} had already involved her, and for which he was still unpunished, than for what he was now proposing. [...] "Or <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> in with me, and Mr. March could take it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{have been}} to the station on purpose to meet you!' cried Mr. Torkingham, 'and was {{returning}} with the idea that you had not come. I am your grandmother's emissary. <b>She</b> <b>could</b> not <b>come</b> herself, and as she was anxious, and nobody else could be spared, I came for her.' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{came first}} into the kitchen, where Mary was at work getting dinner, and {{he asked her to}} come out and help him get his {{wheelbarrow}} out of a hole.
