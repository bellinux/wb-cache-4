25|$|As desired and expected, news of {{a contest}} of such {{distance}} evoked strong enthusiasm both within and without the motorsport community. Newspaper and trade magazine articles used ever-new superlatives for the challenges expected to soon face both drivers and engineers, and continuing discussion throughout the spring and winter kept the race as the primary conversation piece of the average citizen. Everyone, it seemed, had <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolutionary}} history is finished. The endeavour is complete. If you'd asked me 20 years ago whether we'd be attempting such a mammoth task, I'd have said 'Don't be ridiculous'. These programmes tell a particular story and I'm sure others will {{come along and}} tell it much better than I did, but I do hope that if people watch it in 50 years' time, it will still have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> {{the world we live}} in.|$|E
25|$|All of {{them had}} <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the Christian form of the Logos. The Catholic Church found it {{necessary}} to distinguish between the Christian logos and that of Heraclitus as part of its ideological distancing from paganism. The necessity to convert by defeating paganism was of paramount importance. Hippolytus of Rome therefore identifies Heraclitus along with the other Pre-Socratics (and Academics) as sources of heresy. Church use of the methods and conclusions of ancient philosophy as such was as yet far in the future, even though many were converted philosophers.|$|E

25|$|The master {{constraint}} programme {{has evolved}} into a fully combinatorial treatment of gravity known as Algebraic Quantum Gravity (AQG). The non-graph changing master constraint operator is adapted in the framework of algebraic quantum gravity. While AQG is inspired by LQG, it differs drastically from it because in AQG there is fundamentally no topology or differential structure – it is background independent in a more generalized sense and could possibly have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> topology change. In this new formulation of quantum gravity AQG semiclassical states always control the fluctuations of all present degrees of freedom. This makes the AQG semiclassical analysis superior over that of LQG, and {{progress has been made in}} establishing it has the correct semiclassical limit and providing contact with familiar low energy physics.|$|E
500|$|... "Express Yourself" [...] {{begins with}} the sound of brass tinkling along, as Madonna chimes the opening line: [...] "Come on girls, do you believe in love? 'Cause I got <b>{{something}}</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it, And it goes something like this." [...] Handclaps and drum beats start as Madonna moves into the chorus of the song, with a thick vocal texture and high-pitched background singing. The chorus is aided by instrumentation from a saxophone and percussion. Madonna then sings the first verse of the song, as a violin sound is added after she finishes the bridge, [...] "Make you feel like a queen on the throne, make you love it till you never come down", a male voice repeating the last line. A synthesizer is played after the second verse as Madonna continues chanting the words [...] "Express yourself" [...] with background vocals singing [...] "Hey, hey, hey, hey" [...] alongside her.|$|E
500|$|This hypothesis, {{although}} not perfect, perhaps best explains the evidence. Eighteen {{months prior to}} an October 1984 conference on lunar origins, Bill Hartmann, Roger Phillips, and Jeff Taylor challenged fellow lunar scientists: [...] "You have eighteen months. Go back to your Apollo data, {{go back to your}} computer, do whatever you have to, but make up your mind. Don't come to our conference unless you have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the Moon's birth." [...] At the 1984 conference at Kona, Hawaii, the giant impact hypothesis emerged as the most popular. Before the conference, there were partisans of the three [...] "traditional" [...] theories, plus a few people who were starting to take the giant impact seriously, and there was a huge apathetic middle who didn’t think the debate would ever be resolved. Afterward there were essentially only two groups: the giant impact camp and the agnostics.|$|E

The reviewer finds Bates among the most readable, and free of the usual [...] "personal twaddle" [...] of travel and adventure books. The reviewer also remarks on Bates's subtitle [...] "...of the origin of species", that Wallace had taken up that theme more fully. In the reviewer's opinion, Bates says little about [...] "the Darwinian hypothesis", focusing instead steadily on natural history, while making [...] "very shrewd remarks" [...] about human society and giving [...] "most glowing" [...] descriptions of tropical scenery. The reviewer notes {{that most of the people}} Bates meets [...] "had a tinge of colour" [...] but made the [...] "lonely Englishman" [...] comfortable with their [...] "winning cordiality", and is amused that in a feast in Ega an Indian dressed up as an entomologist, complete with insect-net, hunting-bag, pincushion, and an old pair of spectacles. As for nature, the reviewer considers that [...] "in Brazil man is oppressed, crushed, by the immensity of nature".|$|E

On August 7, 2011, Nicki experienced a [...] "nip slip" [...] during a live performance on Good Morning America. Minaj was criticized for wearing the low-cut shirt during her performance which led to the brief exposure of her breast on a live telecast. ABC apologized for incident. Minaj, while interviewed on ABC's Nightline show, apologized for the incident and denied that she intentionally sought to expose herself on live television as a publicity stunt. The incident soaked protest from the Parents Television Council. President of the PTC president Tim Winter stated, [...] "the Parents Television Council has <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> Nicki Minaj's wardrobe malfunction this morning. For the umpteenth time in recent memory a morning news show has included inappropriate content for children and families." [...] Winter called out Good Morning America for not using the five-second delay to prevent the broadcast of the exposure. Minaj has been invited to perform at fashion events; Donatella Versace invited her to perform with Prince for the introduction of a Versace collection for H, and she performed [...] "Super Bass" [...] at the 2011 Victoria's Secret Fashion Show.|$|E

His column continued for 17 years. He wrote several books: Built As a City in 1974 about urban mission, Bias to the Poor in 1983, and two autobiographies, Parson's Pitch in 1964 and Steps Along Hope Street in 2002 (named after the street in Liverpool which links the Anglican and Roman Catholic cathedrals).|$|E
2500|$|When {{both the}} Williams sisters entered {{the top ten}} and started meeting in tournaments, {{unsubstantiated}} rumors of match fixing started to circulate.

[...] Elena Dementieva, a fellow professional player, said during a post match interview after losing to Venus at the Indian Wells quarterfinals in 2001, that Richard Williams decided the results between the two sisters. Venus pulling out at the last minute garnered much speculation in the press, with fans demanding their money back.|$|E
2500|$|Reviewer James Berardinelli {{stated that}} it was arguably one of Kubrick's best films. Along with {{considering}} Kidman [...] "consistently excellent", he wrote that Kubrick [...] "has <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the causes and effects of depersonalized sex", and praised the work as [...] "thought-provoking and unsettling." [...] Writing for The New York Times, reviewer Janet Maslin commented, [...] "This is a dead-serious film about sexual yearnings, one that flirts with ridicule yet sustains its fundamental eeriness and gravity throughout. The dreamlike intensity of previous Kubrick visions is in full force here." [...] Writing about erotic mystery thrillers, writer Leigh Lundin comments that watching the dissolving marriage was painful and the backdrop of Christmas against the dark topic was disturbing, but [...] "the oblique, well-told plot rewards an attentive viewer".|$|E

2500|$|Some {{issues that}} caused the {{distrust}} between the relations of US supported Cubans and the Agency, was a [...] "shaky" [...] front due to no real agreement among the Cubans and the Agency. [...] "The Cuban leaders wanted <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> the course of paramilitary operations," [...] according to an inspection done by Inspector General Pfeiffer,. Questions arose within this inspection that included, [...] "If the project had been better conceived, better organized, better staffed and better managed, would that precise issue ever had to be presented for Presidential decision at all?" [...] According to General Pfeiffer. Further investigation proved that the 1,500 men {{would not have been}} enough from the start against Castro's large military forces, as well as Agencies lack of [...] "top-flight handling," [...] which altogether led to the complete failure of Operation Mongoose as well as Bay of Pigs.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{incident}} McQueen's stepfather persuaded {{his mother to}} sign a court order stating that McQueen was incorrigible, remanding him to the California Junior Boys Republic in Chino. Here, McQueen began to change and mature. He was not popular with the other boys at first: [...] "Say the boys had a chance once a month to load into a bus and go into town to see a movie. And they lost out because one guy in the bungalow didn't get his work done right. Well, you can pretty well guess they're gonna have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> that. I paid my dues with the other fellows quite a few times. I got my lumps, no doubt about it. The other guys in the bungalow had ways of paying you back for interfering with their well-being." [...] Ultimately McQueen became a role model {{when he was elected}} to the Boys Council, a group who set the rules and regulations governing the boys' lives. He eventually left the Boys Republic at age 16. When he later became famous he regularly returned to talk to the boys and retained a lifelong association.|$|E

He's been asked about his music, like, everyday of his fucking life, so you'd think that he'd have <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>about</b> it ... I'm not in contempt of him, though. I just hate that if someone is drug-damaged, or eccentric, or possibly mad, people will let them shit all over themselves thinking, 'Isn't he cool?'." [...] In 2014, fans reacted negatively to the announcement that Wilson was to record a duets album, titled No Pier Pressure, and called it a [...] "cash-in". A Facebook post attributed to Wilson responded to the feedback: [...] "In my life in music, I’ve been told too many times not to fuck with the formula, but as an artist it’s my job to do that." [...] The album received mixed or average reviews.|$|E
