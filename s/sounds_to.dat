5|$|Mother-cub vocalisations: Apart from chirping, mothers {{use some}} other <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> {{interact}} with their cubs. A repeated ihn ihn is used to gather the cubs, while a prr prr is used to guide them on a journey. A low-pitched alarm call is used to warn the cubs to stand still {{in the presence of}} danger.|$|E
2500|$|The {{arrival of}} sound was her undoing. Pickford underestimated {{the value of}} adding <b>sound</b> <b>to</b> movies, {{claiming}} that [...] "adding <b>sound</b> <b>to</b> movies would be like putting lipstick on the Venus de Milo".|$|R
50|$|Some {{languages}} add a <b>sound</b> <b>to</b> {{the end of}} a loanword when {{it would}} otherwise end in a forbidden sound. Similarly, some languages add a <b>sound</b> <b>to</b> {{the end of a}} loanword to make it declinable.|$|R
5000|$|The Isle of Vementry is {{separated}} from the mainland Vementry by a narrow channel or [...] "sound", consisting of Uyea <b>Sound</b> <b>to</b> the east and Cribba <b>Sound</b> <b>to</b> the west.

5|$|Some carmakers {{announced}} they {{have decided to}} address this safety issue, and as a result, the new Nissan Leaf electric car and Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid, both launched in December 2010, {{as well as the}} Fisker Karma plug-in hybrid launched in 2011 launched in 2012, include electric warning <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> alert pedestrians, the blind and others to their presence. , most of the hybrids and plug-in electric and hybrids available in the United States, Japan and Europe make warning noises using a speaker system. The Tesla Model S {{is one of the few}} electric cars without warning sounds, because Tesla Motors will await until regulations are enacted. Volkswagen and BMW also decided to add artificial <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> their electric drive cars only when required by regulation.|$|E
5|$|The company targets two {{different}} applications with the products: 1. EV warning <b>sounds,</b> <b>to</b> make electric vehicles meet the upcoming legislations, and 2. Increased driving experience to make electric vehicles more popular among customer groups that appreciate real engine sounds.|$|E
5|$|Larry Schmittou {{sold his}} {{majority}} {{interest in the}} <b>Sounds</b> <b>to</b> Al Gordon, president of AmeriSports Companies LLC, before the 1997 season. The new ownership group refurbished every area of the stadium, including the concession stands, bathrooms, concourse, stadium exterior, home clubhouse (a visitor's clubhouse had been built under the third base bleachers for the 1996 season), and parking lots. Several sections of bleachers in left field past third base were removed and replaced by tents and a group picnic area. This brought the seating capacity to 11,500.|$|E

5|$|Sound {{designer}} Frank Serafine, {{a longtime}} Star Trek fan, {{was invited to}} create the sound effects for the picture. Given access to state-of-the-art audio equipment, Serafine saw the picture as the chance to modernize outdated motion picture sound techniques with digital technology. Owing to background noise such as camera operation, much of the ambient noise or dialogue captured on set was unusable; it was Serafine's job to create or recreate <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> mix back into the scenes.|$|E
5|$|Sound {{movement}} {{through the atmosphere}} is affected by wind shear, which can bend the wave front, causing <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> be heard where they normally would not, or vice versa. Strong vertical wind shear within the troposphere also inhibits tropical cyclone development, but helps to organize individual thunderstorms into living longer life cycles that can then produce severe weather. The thermal wind concept explains how differences in wind speed with height are dependent on horizontal temperature differences, and explains {{the existence of the}} jet stream.|$|E
5|$|The band {{rented a}} house, {{and hoped that}} living communally would foster good {{relations}} and a happier recording environment. According to Corgan, Iha refused {{to live in the}} house and rarely visited. The recording sessions continued to be slow-moving and heavily technical. In the absence of a drummer, the band used a drum machine as it had in its earliest incarnation. The band also enlisted Joey Waronker, of Beck's band, and Matt Cameron, of Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, for a few songs each. Bon Harris of Nitzer Ebb contributed electronic sequencing and <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> eight album tracks, with the band giving him mostly free rein.|$|E

5|$|The {{new wave}} of British heavy metal (commonly {{abbreviated}} as NWOBHM) was a nationwide musical movement that started in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s and achieved international attention by the early 1980s. Journalist Geoff Barton coined the term in a May 1979 issue of the British music newspaper <b>Sounds</b> <b>to</b> describe {{the emergence of new}} heavy metal bands in the late 1970s, during the period of punk rock's decline and the dominance of new wave music.|$|E
5|$|The style {{began in}} the late 1960s and early 1970s with the works of free-form jazz groups {{recording}} on the ECM label; such as Oregon, the Paul Winter Consort, and other pre-ambient bands; as well as ambient music performer Brian Eno, classical avant-garde musician Daniel Kobialka, and the psychoacoustic environments recordings of Irv Teibel. In the early 1970s, it was mostly instrumental with both acoustic and electronic styles. New-age music evolved to include a wide range of styles from electronic space music using synthesizers and acoustic instrumentals using Native American flutes and drums, singing bowls, Australian didgeredoos and world music <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> spiritual chanting from other cultures.|$|E
5|$|To cater more {{specifically}} to the church market, Hammond introduced the Concert Model E in July 1937, which included a full 32-note pedalboard and four electric switches known as toe pistons, allowing various <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> be selected by the feet. The model E {{was replaced by the}} model RT in 1949, which retained the full-sized pedalboard, but otherwise was internally identical to the B and C models. RT-2 and RT-3 models subsequently appeared in line with the B-2/C-2 and B-3/C-3, respectively.|$|E

Shishmaref and Vasilieventered the Chukchi Sea and explored the coast of Alaska from Kotzebue <b>Sound</b> <b>to</b> Icy Cape and later from Norton <b>Sound</b> <b>to</b> Cape Newenham.|$|R
5|$|According to Louis Philippe, the game's audio director, {{the team}} {{originally}} used intense music and <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> create tension. However, the team decided to scrap this idea, {{realizing that the}} best way to create a tense atmosphere is to create the sounds of other players, which are often unexpected. The team created Navigation Sounds, in which the sound a player made is determined by their operators' weight, armor, and speed. Gadget deployment such as fortifying and breach-charging create louder sounds that may reveal the player's presence. The team thought that this would be enjoyable for players and influence their gameplay experience. The game's music was composed by Paul Haslinger, who had worked on the score of the previous Rainbow Six games and the Far Cry series. His co-composer was Ben Frost, who debuted his first video game soundtrack with Siege. Leon Purviance assisted Frost and Haslinger in composing the music.|$|E
5|$|During {{production}} Burtt had {{the opportunity}} to look at the items used by Jimmy MacDonald, Disney's in-house sound designer for many of their classic films. Burtt used many of MacDonald's items on WALL-E. Because Burtt was not simply adding sound effects in post-production, the animators were always evaluating his new creations and ideas, which Burtt found an unusual experience. He worked in sync with the animators, returning their animation after adding the <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> give them more ideas. Burtt would choose scientifically accurate sounds for each character, but if he could not find one that worked, he would choose a dramatic and unrealistic noise. Burtt would find hundreds of sounds by looking at concept art of characters, before he and Stanton pared it down to a distinct few for each robot.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, PCL Manager of the Year Steve Scarsone led the <b>Sounds</b> <b>to</b> a league-best 83–59 {{record and}} the American Conference Southern Division title, sending the team to the postseason {{for the first time}} since 2007. The Sounds lost the American Conference series versus the Oklahoma City Dodgers, three games to two, {{including}} a dramatic back-and-forth game seven. At First Tennessee Park, the Sounds added the Country Legends Race, similar to major league mascot races, such as the Sausage Race and Presidents Race, to its between-innings entertainment in 2016. In the middle of the fifth inning, people in oversized foam caricature costumes depicting country musicians Johnny Cash, George Jones, and Reba McEntire race around the warning track from center field, through the visiting bullpen, and to the home plate side of the first base dugout.|$|E
5000|$|Sahara Hotnights sound {{has been}} {{described}} as a mix between Blondie, The Ramones, and Nirvana. Although their latest work has a more pop <b>sound</b> <b>to</b> it, Sahara Hotnights have always been influenced by classic rock and punk bands. When the Kiss & Tell album was released, many accustomed to the unforgiving stance of Jennie Bomb balked at their attempt to make an album that was dance crafty. However, Maria Andersson, described the Jennie Bomb album as having a [...] "slick <b>sound</b> <b>to</b> the rock songs, while Kiss and Tell has a raw <b>sound</b> <b>to</b> the pop songs." ...|$|R

5|$|On September 12, 2013, NASA officially {{confirmed}} that Voyager 1 {{had reached the}} interstellar medium in August 2012 as previously observed, with a generally accepted date of August 25, 2012, the date durable changes in the density of energetic particles were first detected. By this point most space scientists had abandoned the hypothesis that a change in magnetic field direction must accompany crossing of the heliopause; {{a new model of}} the heliopause predicted that no such change would be found. A key finding that persuaded many scientists that the heliopause had been crossed was an indirect measurement of an 80-fold increase in electron density, based on the frequency of plasma oscillations observed beginning on April 9, 2013, triggered by a solar outburst that had occurred in March 2012 (electron density is expected to be two orders of magnitude higher outside the heliopause than within). Weaker sets of oscillations measured in October and November 2012 provided additional data. An indirect measurement was required because Voyager 1s plasma spectrometer had stopped working in 1980. In September 2013, NASA released audio renditions of these plasma waves. The recordings represent the first <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> be captured in interstellar space.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneously, an {{unrelated}} movement of communal singing was established throughout the South and Western states. A format of teaching music to illiterate people appeared in 1800. It used four <b>sounds</b> <b>to</b> symbolize the basic scale: fa-sol-la-fa-sol-la-mi-fa. Each sound {{was accompanied by}} a specifically shaped note and thus became known as shape note singing. The method was simple to learn and teach, so schools were established throughout the South and West. Communities would come together for an entire day of singing in a large building where they sat in four distinct areas surrounding an open space, one member directing the group as a whole. Most of the music was Christian, but the purpose of communal singing was not primarily spiritual. Communities either could not afford music accompaniment or rejected it out of a Calvinistic sense of simplicity, so the songs were sung a cappella.|$|E
5|$|The Sounds {{had planned}} to leave Greer Stadium in the mid 2000s for a new {{ballpark}} to be called First Tennessee Field, but the project was abandoned after the city, developers, and team could not come to terms {{on a plan to}} finance its construction. On October 30, 2008, following this failure to secure a new ballpark, Amerisports Companies LLC entered into an agreement to sell the <b>Sounds</b> <b>to</b> MFP Baseball, a New York-based group of investors consisting of Masahiro Honzawa, Steve Posner, and Frank Ward. Keeping the team in Nashville was one of the PCL's top criteria for approval of the sale. The transaction received final approval from Major League Baseball and the PCL on February 26, 2009. MFP made significant renovations to Greer Stadium while it continued to explore options for building a new downtown ballpark for the club.|$|E
