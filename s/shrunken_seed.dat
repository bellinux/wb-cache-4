40|$|Sulfurtransferases (STRs) {{catalyze}} {{the transfer}} of a sulfur atom from a donor to a suitable acceptor molecule. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes 20 putative STR proteins. The biological functions of most are unclear. We found that STR 1 and STR 2 play important roles in embryo/seed development. Mutation of STR 1 alone resulted in a <b>shrunken</b> <b>seed</b> phenotype, although growth and development of vegetative and reproductive organs were not affected. The <b>shrunken</b> <b>seed</b> phenotype {{was associated with the}} delayed/arrested embryo development, in most cases, at the heart stage. The embryo defect of str 1 mutant is not fully penetrant. Approximately 12. 5 % of embryos developed further and formed normal looking seeds. In severely shrunken seeds, no embryo could be identified after seed collection. Partially shrunken seeds that contained viable embryos could still germinate. However, cotyledons of the seedlings from such seeds were abnormal. An STR 1 -GUS fusion reporter revealed that the STR 1 gene was universally expressed, with high levels of expression in specific tissues/organs including embryos. The incomplete penetrance of str 1 embryo/seed phenotype is a result of functional STR 2. Single str 2 mutant had no phenotype. However, no str 1 −/−/str 2 −/− double mutant embryos were able to develop past the heart stage. Furthermore, STR 2 is haplo-insufficient in str 1 mutant background, and str 1 −/−/str 2 +/− embryos were 100 % lethal. These data provide new insights into the biological functions of the ubiquitous sulfurtransferase in Arabidopsis embryogenesis and seed development...|$|E
40|$|Mature Arabidopsis {{seeds are}} enriched in storage {{proteins}} and lipids, but lack starch. In the <b>shrunken</b> <b>seed</b> 1 (sse 1) mutant, however, starch is favored over proteins and lipids {{as the major}} storage compound. SSE 1 has 26 percent identity with Pex 16 p in Yarrowia lipolytica and complements pex 16 mutants defective {{in the formation of}} peroxisomes and the transportation of plasma membrane— and cell wall—associated proteins. In Arabidopsis maturing seeds, SSE 1 is re-quired for protein and oil body biogenesis, both of which are endoplasmic reticulum—dependent. Starch accumulation in sse 1 suggests that starch for-mation is a default storage deposition pathway. To support young seedling growth flowering plants deposit storage compounds (principally composed of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids) in their seeds.

40|$|Eukaryotic {{cold shock}} domain {{proteins}} are nucleic acid-binding proteins {{that are involved}} in transcription, translation via RNA chaperone activity, RNA editing, and DNA repair during tissue developmental processes and stress responses. Cold shock domain proteins have been functionally implicated in important developmental transitions, including embryogenesis, in both animals and plants. Arabidopsis thaliana cold shock domain protein 4 (AtCSP 4) contains a well conserved cold shock domain (CSD) and glycine-rich motifs interspersed by two retroviral-like CCHC zinc fingers. AtCSP 4 is expressed in all tissues but accumulates in reproductive tissues and those undergoing cell divisions. Overexpression of AtCSP 4 reduces silique length and induces embryo lethality. Interestingly, a T-DNA insertion atcsp 4 mutant does not exhibit any morphological abnormalities, suggesting that the related AtCSP 2 gene is functionally redundant with AtCSP 4. During silique development, AtCSP 4 overexpression induced early browning and <b>shrunken</b> <b>seed</b> formation beginning with the late heart embryo stage. A 50 % segregation ratio of the defective seed phenotype was consistent with the phenotype of endosperm development gene mutants. Transcripts of FUS 3 and LEC 1 genes, which regulate early embryo formation, were not altered in the AtCSP 4 overexpression lines. On the other hand, MEA and FIS 2 transcripts, which are involved in endosperm development, were affected by AtCSP 4 overexpression. Additionally, AtCSP 4 overexpression resulted in up-regulation of several MADS-box genes (AP 1, CAL, AG, and SHP 2) during early stages of silique development. Collectively, these data suggest that AtCSP 4 plays an important role during the late stages of silique development by affecting the expression of several development-related genes...|$|E
40|$|Lysophosphatidyl acyltransferase (LPAAT) is {{a pivotal}} enzyme {{controlling}} the metabolic flow of lysophosphatidic acid into different phosphatidic acids in diverse tissues. A {{search of the}} Arabidopsis genome database revealed five genes that could encode LPAAT-like proteins. We identified one of them, LPAAT 1, to be the lone gene that encodes the plastid LPAAT. LPAAT 1 could functionally complement a bacterial mutant that has defective LPAAT. Bacteria transformed with LPAAT 1 produced LPAAT that had in vitro enzyme activity much higher on 16 : 0 -coenzyme A than on 18 : 1 -coenzyme A {{in the presence of}} 18 : 1 -lysophosphatidic acid. LPAAT 1 transcript was present in diverse organs, with the highest level in green leaves. A mutant having a T-DNA inserted into LPAAT 1 was identified. The heterozygous mutant has no overt phenotype, and its leaf acyl composition {{is similar to that of}} the wild type. Selfing of a heterozygous mutant produced normal-sized and <b>shrunken</b> <b>seeds</b> in the Mendelian ratio of 3 : 1, and the <b>shrunken</b> <b>seeds</b> could not germinate. The <b>shrunken</b> <b>seeds</b> apparently were homozygous of the T-DNA-inserted LPAAT 1, and development of the embryo within them was arrested at the heart-torpedo stage. This embryo lethality could be rescued by transformation of the heterozygous mutant with a 35 S:LPAAT 1 construct. The current findings of embryo death in the homozygous knockout mutant of the plastid LPAAT contrasts with earlier findings of a normal phenotype in the homozygous mutant deficient of the plastid glycerol- 3 -phosphate acyltransferase; both mutations block the synthesis of plastid phosphatidic acid. Reasons for the discrepancy between the contrasting phenotypes of the two mutants are discussed...|$|R
30|$|Plants at all {{developmental}} stages exhibited {{dynamics of}} leaf symptoms described above regarding the stress duration (Fig.  2 a–d). Additionally, unique plant and seed morphology were observed at certain developmental stages. When plants exposed to stress at the tillering stage {{were able to}} recover faster after re-watering. Leaf dryness at the tip without expanding, and generating new leaves under prolonged drought were observed only at tillering stage. Application of drought during the booting stage resulted in partial or complete inhibition of boots opening for all the genotypes, when awns with {{only half of the}} spikelet were seen (Fig.  2 e). At the heading stage, we observed {{decline in the number of}} spikes, especially that are followed by the main spike. The most severe impact of the drought was at the booting and anthesis stages, causing empty spikes or <b>shrunken</b> <b>seeds</b> (Fig.  2 f), especially with the prolonged duration that has obstructed the seed development.|$|R
40|$|Glycoproteins with asparagine-linked (N-linked) glycans {{occur in}} all {{eukaryotic}} cells. The function of their glycan moieties {{is one of}} the central problems in contemporary cell biology. N-glycosylation may modify physicochemical and biological protein properties such as conformation, degradation, intracellular sorting or secretion. We have isolated and characterized two allelic Arabidopsis mutants, gcs 1 - 1 and gcs 1 - 2, which produce abnormal <b>shrunken</b> <b>seeds,</b> blocked at the heart stage of development. The mutant seeds accumulate a low level of storage proteins, have no typical protein bodies, display abnormal cell enlargement and show occasional cell wall disruptions. The mutated gene has been cloned by T-DNA tagging. It codes for a protein homologous to animal and yeast α-glucosidase I, an enzyme that controls the first committed step for N-glycan trimming. Biochemical analyses have confirmed that trimming of the α 1, 2 - linked glucosyl residue constitutive of the N-glycan precursor is blocked in this mutant. These results demonstrate the importance of N-glycan trimming for the accumulation of seed storage proteins, the formation of protein bodies, cell differentiation and embryo development...|$|R
40|$|The Arabidopsis <b>Shrunken</b> <b>Seed</b> 1 (SSE 1) gene encodes a homolog of the {{peroxisome}} biogenesis factor Pex 16 p, and a loss-of-function {{mutation in}} this gene alters seed storage composition. Two lines of evidence support a function for SSE 1 in peroxisome biogenesis: the peroxisomal localization {{of a green}} fluorescent protein-SSE 1 fusion protein {{and the lack of}} normal peroxisomes in sse 1 mutant embryos. The green fluorescent protein-SSE 1 colocalizes with the red fluorescent protein (RFP) -labeled peroxisomal markers RFP-peroxisome targeting signal 1 and peroxisome targeting signal 2 -RFP in transgenic Arabidopsis. Each peroxisomal marker exhibits a normal punctate peroxisomal distribution in the wild type but not the sse 1 mutant embryos. Further studies reported here were designed toward understanding carbon metabolism in the sse 1 mutant. A time course study of dissected embryos revealed a dramatic rate decrease in oil accumulation and an increase in starch accumulation. Introduction of starch synthesis mutations into the sse 1 background did not restore oil biosynthesis. This finding demonstrated that reduction in oil content in sse 1 is not caused by increased carbon flow to starch. To identify the blocked steps in the sse 1 oil deposition pathway, developing sse 1 seeds were supplied radiolabeled oil synthesis precursors. The ability of sse 1 to incorporate oleic acid, but not pyruvate or acetate, into triacylglycerol indicated a defect in the fatty acid biosynthetic pathway in this mutant. Taken together, the results point to a possible role for peroxisomes in the net synthesis of fatty acids in addition to their established function in lipid catabolism. Other possible interpretations of the results are discussed...|$|E
5000|$|Embryo rescue {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} and successful forms of in-vitro culture techniques that is used to assist in the development of plant embryos that might not survive to become viable plants. [...] Embryo rescue {{plays an important role in}} modern plant breeding, allowing the development of many interspecific and intergeneric food and ornamental plant crop hybrids. This technique nurtures the immature or weak embryo, thus allowing it the chance to survive. Plant embryos are multicellular structures that have the potential to develop into a new plant. The most widely used embryo rescue procedure is referred to as embryo culture, and involves excising plant embryos and placing them onto media culture. Embryo rescue is most often used to create interspecific and intergeneric crosses that would normally produce seeds which are aborted. Interspecific incompatibility in plants can occur for many reasons, but most often embryo abortion occurs [...] In plant breeding, wide hybridization crosses can result in small <b>shrunken</b> <b>seeds</b> which indicate that fertilization has occurred, however the seed fails to develop. Many times, remote hybridizations will fail to undergo normal sexual reproduction, thus embryo rescue can assist in circumventing this problem.|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{initiate}} radicle elongation, or germination potential, occurs in developing embryos before {{the completion of}} seedmaturation. Green embryos after the walking-stick stage in developing Arabidopsis thaliana seeds germinate when excised from seeds and incubated in Murashige–Skoog (MS) medium contain-ing 1 % sucrose. Germination potential is not observed during early embryogenesis at the globular, heart and torpedo stages. Here, we describe an Arabidopsis mutant with embryos arrested at early stages of development, but still exhibiting germination potential. The mutant, termed embryo ball (eb), produced <b>shrunken</b> <b>seeds</b> containing round or irregularly shaped embryos that did not germinate. The round embryos excised from developing eb seeds were capable of growing a primary root with root hairs when incubated in media. In contrast, cotyledonswere absent at the apical region of the eb embryos, although the apical region produced leaf-like structures with trichomes, indicating vegetative leaf identity. These observations suggested that morphological maturation was not essential for the induction of germination potential. The eb embryos exhibited partial desiccation tolerance that is characteristic of mature embryos at later stages of development, suggesting that cell maturation was also independent of morphological maturation. The eb mutant provides novel information on cell and tissue identity in developmental biology, aswell as a useful tool to dissect the mechanisms underlying the induction of germination potential in developing seeds...|$|R
40|$|Previous work {{showed that}} the segl mutant of barley (Hordeum vulgare cv Betzes) {{did not differ from}} normal Betzes in plant growth, photosynthesis, or fertility, but it {{produced}} only <b>shrunken</b> <b>seeds</b> regardless of pollen source. To determine whether defects in sucrose uptake or starch synthesis resulted in the shrunken condition, developing grains of Betzes and segl were cultured in [14 C]sucrose solutions after slicing transversely to expose the endosperm cavity and free space. In both young grains (before genotypes differed in dry weight) and older grains (17 days after anthesis, when segl grains were smaller than Betzes), sucrose uptake and starch synthesis were similar in both genotypes on a dry weight basis. To determine if sucrose was hydrolyzed during uptake, spikes of Betzes and segl were allowed to take up [fructose-U- 14 C]sucrose 14 days after anthesis and the radioactivity of endosperm sugars was examined during 3 hours of incubation. Whereas less total radioactivity entered the endosperm and the endosperm cavity (free space) of segl, in both genotypes over 96 % of the label of endosperm sugars was in sucrose, and there was no apparent initial or progressive randomization of label among hexose moieties of sucrose as compared to the free space sampled after 1 hour of incubation. We conclude that segl endosperms are capable of normal sucrose uptake and starch synthesis and that hydrolysis of sucrose is not required for uptake in either genotype. Evidence suggests abnormal development of grain tissue of maternal origin during growth of segl grains...|$|R
40|$|Barley grain starch {{is formed}} by amylose and {{amylopectin}} in a 1 : 3 ratio, and is packed into granules of different dimensions. The distribution of granule dimension is bimodal, {{with a majority}} of small spherical B-granules and a smaller amount of large discoidal A-granules containing {{the majority of the}} starch. Starch granules are semi-crystalline structures with characteristic X-ray diffraction patterns. Distinct features of starch granules are controlled by different enzymes and are relevant for nutritional value or industrial applications. Here, the Targeting-Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes (TILLING) approach was applied on the barley TILLMore TILLING population to identify 29 new alleles in five genes related to starch metabolism known to be expressed in the endosperm during grain filling: BMY 1 (Beta-amylase 1), GBSSI (Granule Bound Starch Synthase I), LDA 1 (Limit Dextrinase 1), SSI (Starch Synthase I), SSIIa (Starch Synthase IIa). Reserve starch of nine M 3 mutant lines carrying missense or nonsense mutations was analysed for granule size, crystallinity and amylose/amylopectin content. Seven mutant lines presented starches with different features in respect to the wild-type: (i) a mutant line with a missense mutation in GBSSI showed a 4 -fold reduced amylose/amylopectin ratio; (ii) a missense mutations in SSI resulted in 2 -fold increase in A:B granule ratio; (iii) a nonsense mutation in SSIIa was associated with <b>shrunken</b> <b>seeds</b> with a 2 -fold increased amylose/amylopectin ratio and different type of crystal packing in the granule; (iv) the remaining four missense mutations suggested a role of LDA 1 in granule initiation, and of SSIIa in determining the size of A-granules.

30|$|As we {{described}} in the results, we obtained some dynamic changes in leaf, spike, and seed symptoms, which associated with either a certain developmental stage, stress duration, or genetic response. Apparently, some leaf symptoms were well documented with drought; but, defining the morphological dynamics during the developmental stages or drought regimes are poorly described, although it is important traits and easy to record. These changes in plant morphology under different environments reflect the plastic response (De Jong and Leyser 2012), and {{are thought to be}} important to indicate specific physiological changes. Accounting the symptoms with the phenotypic measurements, the plant response pipeline could be drawn. Leaf wilting and rolling are indicated the start of a lack of available moisture in the soil and a consequent shortage of water transport to stem and leaves, then follow by correlation with reduced photosynthesis and pigment content. Also, leaf rolling occurs typically in most grasses including rice, maize, and sorghum during perception of drought induced by increased production of salicylic acid signal (Kadioglu and Terzi 2007). Those symptoms would not be used to indicate the plastic response to drought, because they are common symptoms through the developmental stages, especially if plants would recover after re-watering. As a result of a reduction of the chlorophyll content, leaf yellowing was observed, which {{can be used as a}} measurement of the damaging effect of drought (Moore and Lovell 1970). While leaf dryness reflects the cell programmed death. When the plants experienced dryness through the whole leaf under drought stress, this should be a non-recoverable symptom unless there is an adaptive mechanism induced to generate new leaves. Tolerant stressed plants at tillering stage experienced leaf dryness through leaf tip, but through the whole leaf only in the sensitive genotypes. Exclusively, at the tillering stage, the generation of new leaves after a prolonged drought indicated the adaptive response to drought. Booting stage was the least plastic developmental stage, crediting unique negative symptom (inhibition of boots opening) resulted in short spikes, few seeds, empty spikes and low seed vigor. At heading stage, limited regeneration would happen especially after the prolonged drought. The plant would focus to survive the spikes that already were formed. Also, drought stress during the anthesis stage drove the stressed plant to maturation faster, shortening the milk and dough stage resulting in <b>shrunken</b> <b>seeds</b> without generating new leaves. Heading and anthesis stages promoted less correlation between the grain number and grain weight, which might be due to the significant impact of drought on the fertile tillers at the spike formation during the grain-filling. Regarding the productive stages, the perturbation in seed development under drought stress may produce <b>shrunken</b> <b>seeds,</b> which contain low protein and starch content, reducing the germination efficiency and causing abnormal seedling development (Wood et al. 1977; Guo et al. 2012). Fábián et al. (2011) highlighted a greater significant reduction in the size of the mature embryos in the sensitive genotype. In addition, the low germinability was correlated with the size, development and genetic variability of plant population (Li et al. 2014). However, taking credits of high germinability and seedling development would value the phenological plasticity of developmental stages. Also, the association found between germinability of the produced seeds and seedling development effected plant morphology and yield uniquely at different developmental stages indicated the dynamics of developmental plasticity.|$|R
40|$|Chloroplast biogenesis and {{function}} {{is essential for}} proper plant embryo and seed development but the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of plastids during embryogenesis are poorly understood. Expression of plastid encoded genes is dependent on two different transcription machineries; a plastid-encoded bacterial-type RNA polymerase (PEP) and a nuclear-encoded phage-type RNA polymerase (NEP), which recognize distinct types of promoters. However, {{the division of labor}} between PEP and NEP during plastid development and in mature chloroplasts is unclear. We show here that PLASTID REDOX INSENSITIVE 2 (PRIN 2) and CHLOROPLAST STEM-LOOP BINDING PROTEIN 41 kDa (CSP 41 b), two proteins identified in plastid nucleoid preparations, are essential for proper plant embryo development. Using Co-IP assays and native PAGE we have shown a direct physical interaction between PRIN 2 and CSP 41 b. Moreover, PRIN 2 and CSP 41 b form a distinct protein complex in vitro that binds DNA. The prin 2. 2 and csp 41 b- 2 single mutants displayed pale phenotypes, abnormal chloroplasts with reduced transcript levels of photosynthesis genes and defects in embryo development. The respective csp 41 b- 2 prin 2. 2 homo/heterozygote double mutants produced abnormal white colored ovules and <b>shrunken</b> <b>seeds.</b> Thus, the csp 41 b- 2 prin 2. 2 double mutant is embryo lethal. In silico analysis of available array data showed {{that a large number of}} genes traditionally classified as PEP dependent genes are transcribed during early embryo development from the pre-globular stage to the mature-green-stage. Taken together, our results suggest that PEP activity and consequently the switch from NEP to PEP activity, is essential during embryo development and that the PRIN 2 -CSP 41 b DNA binding protein complex possibly is important for full PEP activity during this process...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the low seed germination of 12 varieties of Oregon grown monogerm sugar beet, Beta vulgaris L., using several methods to determine the germination potential. The methods were: (1) X-ray radiograph examination, (2) standard laboratory germination following official rules, (3) laboratory germination by hydrogen peroxide method, and (4) field emergence. The X-ray technique was effective and accurate for determining the number of undeveloped seeds in the varieties examined. The use of this technique for determining germination potential is questionable at this time, since the abnormalities present in the seedballs could not be detected from the radiograph. The speed of germination, as well as total germination, was higher for the hydrogen peroxide method than the standard method. There was less difference between the two methods for those varieties having decorticated seed. The results of the hydrogen peroxide method compared more favorably with the field emergence results than did the standard method. The primary factors contributing to low laboratory germination were: (1) undeveloped seeds, (2) abnormal seedlings, and (3) firm ungerminated seeds. The undeveloped seed class included the completely empty seedball cavities and those seedballs having <b>shrunken</b> <b>seeds.</b> The abnormal seedlings were caused primarily by seed-borne pathogens and were most frequent in those varieties having natural seedballs. Abnormalities were higher when using the standard method than with the hydrogen peroxide method. The role of inhibitors, as determined by the number of firm ungerminated seeds, was minor for all the varieties except one. It was determined that of the three laboratory methods investigated, no single method would give an accurate estimate of the total germination potential of a variety. Therefore, either the X-ray technique or cutting should supplement one of the regular laboratory germination methods to gain additional information on the seedlot's potential...|$|R
40|$|Insertional {{mutagenesis}} of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) {{was used}} to identify a novel recessive mutant, designated resurrection 1 (rst 1), which possesses a dramatic alteration in its cuticular waxes and produces <b>shrunken</b> nonviable <b>seeds</b> due to arrested embryo development. The RST 1 gene sequence associated with these phenotypes was verified by three independent, allelic, insertion mutants, designated rst 1 - 1, rst 1 - 2, and rst 1 - 3, with inserts in the first exon, 12 th intron, and fourth exon, respectively. These three rst 1 allelic mutants have nearly identical alterations in their wax profiles and embryo development. Compared to wild type, the wax on rst 1 inflorescence stems is reduced nearly 60 % in total amount, has a proportional reduction in aldehydes and aldehyde metabolites, and has a proportional increase in acids, primary alcohols, and esters. Compared to wild type, the C 29 alkanes on rst 1 are nearly 6 -fold lower, and the C 30 primary alcohols are 4 -fold higher. These results indicate that rst 1 causes shunting of most wax precursors away from alkane synthesis and into the primary-alcohol-producing branch of the pathway. In contrast to stems, the wax on rst 1 mutant leaves increased roughly 43 % in amount relative to the wild type, with the major increase occurring in the C 31 and C 33 alkanes. Unique among known wax mutants, approximately 70 % of rst 1 <b>seeds</b> are <b>shrunken</b> and nonviable, with these being randomly distributed within both inflorescence and silique. Viable seeds of rst 1 are slightly larger than those of wild type, and although the viable rst 1 seeds contain more total triacylglycerol-derived fatty acids, the proportions of these fatty acids are {{not significantly different from}} wild type. <b>Shrunken</b> <b>seeds</b> contain 34 % of the fatty acids of wild-type seeds, with proportionally more palmitic, stearic, and oleic acids, and less of the longer and more desaturated homologs. Histological analysis of aborted rst 1 seeds revealed that embryo development terminates at the approximate heart-shaped stage, whereas viable rst 1 and wild-type embryos develop similarly. The RST 1 gene encodes a predicted 1, 841 -amino acid novel protein with a molecular mass of 203. 6 kD and a theoretical pI of 6. 21. The RST 1 transcript was found in all tissues examined including leaves, flowers, roots, stems, and siliques, but accumulation levels were not correlated with the degree to which different organs appeared affected by the mutation.
