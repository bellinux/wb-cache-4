25|$|Liposuction, {{also known}} as lipoplasty, is a {{cosmetic}} surgical procedure that slims and reshapes specific areas of the body by removing excess fat deposits, improving the body's contours and proportion, and ultimately, enhancing the patient's self-image. Liposuction {{involves the use of}} a small <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tube,</b> called a cannula. The cannula is connected to a powerful suction pump and inserted into the fat through small incisions in the skin. Fat removal is accomplished as the suction cannula creates tiny tunnels through the fatty layers. Liposuction can be performed on both men and women. Ideal for this type of procedure are non-smokers, healthy individuals who do not have a life-threatening illness or medical conditions that can impair healing, adults within 30% of their ideal weight who have firm and elastic skin.|$|E
500|$|The engine's nozzle is [...] {{long with}} a {{diameter}} of [...] at its throat and [...] at its exit. The nozzle is a bell-shaped extension bolted to the main combustion chamber, {{referred to as a}} de Laval nozzle. The RS-25 nozzle has an unusually large expansion ratio (about 77.5:1) for the chamber pressure. At sea level, a nozzle of this ratio would normally undergo flow separation of the jet from the nozzle, which would cause control difficulties and could even mechanically damage the vehicle. However, to aid the engine's operation [...] Rocketdyne engineers varied the angle of the nozzle walls from the theoretical optimum for thrust, reducing it near the exit. This raises the pressure just around the rim to an absolute pressure between , and prevents flow separation. The inner part of the flow is at much lower pressure, around [...] or less. The inner surface of each nozzle is cooled by liquid hydrogen flowing through brazed <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> wall coolant passages. On the Space Shuttle, a support ring welded to the forward end of the nozzle is the engine attach point to the orbiter-supplied heat shield. Thermal protection is necessary because of the exposure portions of the nozzles experience during the launch, ascent, on-orbit and entry phases of a mission. The insulation consists of four layers of metallic batting covered with a metallic foil and screening.|$|E

The nominal compressive concrete strengths were ranged from 30 to 110 MPa. The numerical results showed good agreement with the experimental results for the concrete-filled <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> SHS and RHS tubular T- and X-joints. Therefore, an extensive parametric study was performed using the verified finite element models to investigate the strength and behaviour of concrete-filled <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> tubular connections. The joint strengths obtained from the parametric study and tests were compared with the current design strengths calculated using the CIDECT design rules for concrete-filled carbon steel tubular joints, which is the only existing design guideline for concrete-filled tubular joints. It {{should be noted that the}} current CIDECT design rules ignore the contribution of the <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> in the calculation of the joint strengths. In this study, design formulae of concrete-filled <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> tubular T- and X-joints are proposed.
