5|$|Fried {{butter is}} a similar dish, for which recipes exist dating to the 17th century. The first known recipe for fried butter dates to 1615. Fried butter was {{documented}} in the cookbook The Art of Cookery Made Plain and Easy in 1747. The recipe entailed soaking butter in <b>salted</b> <b>water</b> for a few hours, placing it on a rotisserie ("spit it"), covering it with breadcrumbs and nutmeg, and roasting it under a low fire while continuously covering it with egg yolks and additional bread crumbs. Oysters were recommended to accompany the dish.|$|E

25|$|Bazin is {{a common}} Libyan food made with wheat flour and a little plain flour, which is boiled in <b>salted</b> <b>water</b> to make a hard dough, and then formed into a rounded, smooth dome placed {{in the middle of}} the dish. The sauce around the dough is made by frying chopped onions with lamb meat, turmeric, salt, cayenne pepper, black pepper, fenugreek, sweet paprika, and tomato paste. Potatoes can also be added. Finally, eggs are boiled and {{arranged}} around the dome. The dish is then served with lemon and fresh or pickled chili peppers, known as amsyar. Batata mubattana (filled potato) is another popular dish that consists of fried potato pieces filled with spiced minced meat and covered with egg and breadcrumbs.|$|E

Coal-dust from home stoves and factories filled the city air, coating windows, clothing, furniture and rugs. Washing clothing and linens meant scrubbing by hand in a large zinc or copper tub.

2500|$|On 23 June 1944, Koenig {{began to}} operate, giving orders {{to all the}} SOE and OSS agents via the Special Forces Headquarters. By this time, the maquis had formed {{assassination}} squads to kill collaborators and on 28 June 1944, a group of maquisards disguised as miliciens were able to enter the apartment of the radio newscaster Philippe Henriot who was serving as Minister of Information and Propaganda in the Vichy government and shot him {{down in front of}} his wife. Darnard had the Milice go on a rampage after Henriot's assassination, massacring résistants in Toulouse, Clermont-Ferrand, Grenoble, Lyon and other places with for example, seven résistants being publicity shot by the Milice in the town square of Mâcon. [...] All over France, the Germans lashed out against the Resistance in an orgy of killings, of which the massacre at Oradour-sur-Glane is merely the most infamous. Speaking of an atrocity committed outside of Nice in July 1944, one man testified at Nurnberg: [...] "Having been attacked [...] [...] [...] by several groups of Maquis in the region, by way of reprisals, a Mongolian detachment, still under the SS, went to a farm where two French members of the Resistance had been hidden. Being unable to take them prisoner, these soldiers then took the proprietors of that farm (the husband and wife), and after subjecting them to numerous atrocities (knifing, rape, et cetera) they shot them down with submachine guns. Then they took the son of these victims who was only three years of age, and, after having frightfully tortured him, they crucified him on the gate of the farmhouse". The reference to the [...] "Mongolians" [...] were to Asians serving in the Red Army who been captured by the Wehrmacht and joined either the German Army's Ostlegionen or the SS; the French called all these men [...] "Mongols" [...] regardless if they were Mongols or not. The Milice was especially hated by the Resistance and captured miliciens could expect little mercy. One maquisard fighting in the Haute-Savoie wrote in his diary about the fate of a milicien taken prisoner in July 1944: [...] "Aged twenty-nine, married three months ago. Made to saw wood in the hot sun wearing a pullover and jacket. Made to drink warm <b>salted</b> <b>water.</b> Ears cut off. Covered with blows from fists and bayonets. Stoned. Made to dig his gave. Made to lie in it. Finished off with a blow in the stomach from a spade. Two days to die".|$|E

Rates were quantified in animals using four experimental treatments: (1) held in fresh water and fed lettuce (N= 4), (2) held in <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> and fed lettuce (N= 2), (3) acutely exposed to <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> and fed lettuce (N= 4), and (4) chronically exposed to <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> with limited access to fresh water and fed sea grass (N= 5). Animals held in fresh water had the highest turnover rates (145 +/- 12 ml kg- 1 day- 1) (mean +/- s. e. m.). Animals acutely exposed to <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> decreased their turnover rate significantly when moved into <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> (from 124 +/- 15 to 65 +/- 15 ml kg- 1 day- 1) and subsequently increased their turnover rate upon re-entry to fresh water (146 +/- 19 ml kg- 1 day- 1). Manatees chronically exposed to <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> had significantly lower turnover rates (21 +/- 3 ml kg- 1 day- 1) compared with animals held in <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> and fed lettuce (45 +/- 3 ml kg- 1 day- 1). Manatees chronically exposed to <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> and fed sea grass had very low turnover rates compared with manatees held in <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> and fed lettuce, which is consistent with a lack of mariposia.

An increase in <b>salt</b> <b>water</b> intrusion is considered as problematic in a lot of estuaries in the world.
