5|$|Leaf– Leaf {{is one of}} Arthur's few human friends. She {{supports}} him in Sir Thursday by retrieving {{the pocket}} that supports {{the existence of the}} <b>Skinless</b> Boy.|$|E
5|$|On Earth, Leaf {{wakes up}} in a {{hospital}} {{a week after the}} <b>Skinless</b> Boy was defeated. She soon learns from a nurse that the Grayspot has disappeared and that Lady Friday, another Trustee, has become a doctor on Earth.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} species of shrimp and fish take refuge among the {{branches}} of Millepora alcicornis, seemingly immune to the venom. Hawkfish in particular often perch {{on top of the}} fire coral, perhaps protected by their <b>skinless</b> pectoral fins. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Millepora alcicornis has few predators. The fireworm (Hermodice carunculata) sometimes grazes on it, but prefers other corals. Certain nudibranchs in the genus Phyllidia eat it as do filefish in the family Monacanthidae.|$|E
5|$|On Earth, Arthur's double, {{known as}} the <b>Skinless</b> Boy, has thrown a {{hospital}} near Arthur's home into panic by infecting staff and patients with a fungoid, extraterrestrial life-form which allows him to read and eventually control their thoughts and actions. This fungus, nicknamed Grayspot, is mistaken for a biological weapon, and the hospital put under quarantine. Leaf infiltrates the hospital, seeking to obtain and destroy the magical object used to create the <b>Skinless</b> Boy: a pocket torn from one of Arthur's shirts. She succeeds, but is infected by Grayspot in the process. She then leaves the hospital, {{only to find that}} the House has appeared above it and cannot be reached from the ground. With the help of a retired pharmacist named Sylvie, Leaf makes her way to Arthur's house where she uses a special telephone to contact Arthur's friends and get help, just as the fungus gains full control of her body.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{unsuccessful}} run for {{the governorship}} in 1987, Brown resumed {{his career in the}} restaurant industry. He started the Chicken Grill restaurant in Louisville and helped his wife, Phyllis, launch Chicken By George, a line of boneless, <b>skinless</b> chicken breast products designed for sale in supermarkets and preparation at home. In 1988, Hormel made Chicken By George one of its subsidiaries. Brown expanded several other restaurants including Miami Subs, Texas Roadhouse, and Roadhouse Grill. None of these ventures matched the success he experienced early in his career.|$|E
5|$|Poultry {{meat and}} eggs provide nutritionally {{beneficial}} food containing protein of high quality. This {{is accompanied by}} low levels of fat which have a favourable mix of fatty acids. Chicken meat contains about {{two to three times}} as much polyunsaturated fat as most types of red meat when measured by weight. However, for boneless, <b>skinless</b> chicken breast, the amount is much lower. A 100-g serving of baked chicken breast contains 4 g of fat and 31 g of protein, compared to 10 g of fat and 27 g of protein for the same portion of broiled, lean skirt steak.|$|E
5|$|Gaza's cuisine is {{characterized}} by its generous use of spices and chillies. Other major flavors and ingredients include dill, chard, garlic, cumin, lentils, chickpeas, pomegranates, sour plums and tamarind. Many of the traditional dishes rely on clay pot cooking, which preserves the flavor and texture of the vegetables and results in fork-tender meat. Traditionally, most Gazan dishes are seasonal and rely on ingredients indigenous to the area and its surrounding villages. Poverty has also {{played an important role}} in determining many of the city's simple meatless dishes and stews, such as saliq wa adas ("chard and lentils") and bisara (<b>skinless</b> fava beans mashed with dried mulukhiya leaves and chilies).|$|E
5|$|Suzy Turquoise Blue {{arrives and}} takes the pocket to the House. There, she finds Arthur and Fred, and joins them in a raid led by Sir Thursday to find and destroy the New Nithlings' weapon, which is {{preventing}} the mechanical floor of the Great Maze from shifting. Arthur destroys the weapon by throwing the pocket into it, simultaneously destroying the <b>Skinless</b> Boy. As Arthur escapes from the Piper with Sir Thursday, he distracts Thursday enough for the fourth part of the Will, a snake embodying the virtue of justice, to break free, whereupon it makes Arthur the Bearer of the Fourth Key – a sword or baton depending {{on whether or not}} the wielder is in combat – and Commander of the Glorious Army of the Architect. With help from Dame Primus and others from the lower demesnes, Arthur defeats the New Nithling army.|$|E
25|$|Kosher casings are {{expensive}} in commercial quantities in the US, so kosher hot dogs are usually <b>skinless</b> or made with reconstituted collagen casings.|$|E
25|$|Gerbils {{can lose}} their tails due to {{improper}} handling, {{being attacked by}} another animal, or getting their tails stuck. The first sign is a loss of fur {{from the tip of}} the tail, then, the <b>skinless</b> tail dies off and sloughs, with the stump usually healing without complications.|$|E
25|$|Six Feet Under {{undertook}} a lengthy bout of American tours, commencing {{in the summer}} of 2002, with supporters <b>Skinless</b> and Sworn Enemy. Their June 14 performance was recorded for a DVD and live album release, Double Dead Redux. September 2002 saw the band touring with Hatebreed. Around Christmas 2002, they participated in some European festivals with bands such as Kataklysm and Dying Fetus.|$|E
25|$|Canned {{salmon in}} the U.S. is usually wild Pacific catch, though some farmed salmon is {{available}} in canned form. Smoked salmon is another popular preparation method, and can either be hot or cold smoked. Lox can refer either to cold smoked salmon or to salmon cured in a brine solution (also called gravlax). Traditional canned salmon includes some skin (which is harmless) and bone (which adds calcium). <b>Skinless</b> and boneless canned salmon is also available.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} {{commensalism}} occurs between the hawkfish and fire coral. Thanks to their large, <b>skinless</b> pectoral fins, hawkfish can perch on fire corals without harm. Fire corals {{are not true}} corals, but are hydrozoans possessing stinging cells called nematocysts which would normally prevent close contact. The protection fire corals offer hawkfish means the hawkfish has the high ground of the reef, and can safely survey its surroundings like a hawk. Hawkfish usually stay motionless, but dart out and grab crustaceans and other small invertebrates as they pass by. They are mostly solitary, although some species form pairs and share a head of coral.|$|E
25|$|Mochizuki {{made his}} {{mainstream}} directorial debut in 1991 with the autobiographical <b>Skinless</b> Night produced {{by his own}} company E-Staff Union. The work revolves about a filmmaker from a background in pink film and now making AVs who is inspired by the discovery of an early student film of his {{to try to make}} an independent movie. The film, which showed more of the tedium of making adult videos than the glamor, was well received at festivals and the video distribution rights were picked up by Japan Home Video, the parent company of Alice Japan. With a new reputation as a mainstream director, Mochizuki filmed The Wicked Reporter for the Daiei studio in 1993. The commercial success of the film about a middle-aged boozing and gambling newspaperman (played by Eiji Okuda) led to two sequels in 1994 and 1996.|$|E
500|$|Production for Over the Garden Wall {{commenced}} in March 2014. McHale initially envisioned eighteen {{chapters in}} the series, but the episode count {{was brought to}} ten to accommodate budget and time constraints. Early drafts of episodes from the show's pitch bible included a <b>skinless</b> witch character and a villain who carves dice from the bones of kidnapped children, as well a running plot throughout four episodes in which Wirt and Gregory are transformed into animals (Gregory being a duck and Wirt being [...] "either a bear or a dog ... Nobody can tell which").|$|E
500|$|The early 1990s saw {{successful}} {{major products}} launched throughout the chain, including spicy [...] "Hot Wings" [...] (launched in 1990), popcorn chicken (1992), and, outside the US, the [...] "Zinger", a spicy chicken fillet burger (1993). In 1993, rotisserie style chicken, {{under the name}} [...] "Colonel's Rotisserie Gold", was introduced at over 30 percent of US outlets. However, despite a $100 million investment in marketing, the product failed to gain sales traction. The launch of <b>skinless</b> chicken, designed to appeal to health-conscious customers, failed; customers disliked the unfamiliar texture, and the product resulted in increased overheads, which contributed to a 37 percent decline in operating profits in 1991.|$|E
500|$|The first {{published}} mention {{of them was}} by George Borrow in his book Wild Wales, written in the 1850s and published in the next decade. He described them as [...] "not a whit inferior to those of Epping"; Epping sausages were <b>skinless</b> meat-based sausages. Borrow visited Y Gwter Fawr (now known as Brynamman); the Tregib Arms has been suggested as the location at which Borrow ate his sausages. Advertisements promoting the sale of Glamorgan sausages in the British Newspaper Archive begin to appear from 1869 onwards, with the first advert placed by pork butcher Henry S. Morgan of 288 Bute Street, Cardiff, placed in the Western Mail on 15 December. Morgan continued to advertise {{over the next several}} years, and by 1874 was claiming that the demand necessitated making the sausages on an hourly basis, and referenced other makers of the sausages making theirs days in advance prior to sale. The advert makes it clear that the sausages were made from [...] "choice dairy-fed pork".|$|E
500|$|... "Hellbound" [...] {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity awarded the episode a [...] "B". John Keegan, writing for Critical Myth, gave the episode a positive review and complimented its exploration of Reyes' character. He rated it an 8 out of 10 and wrote that [...] "overall, a wonderful unexpected {{look into the}} underlying motivations of a character that, until now, has been only vaguely drawn for the audience. Thankfully it is completely consistent {{with what we have}} seen before". Keegan added that the [...] "greatest drawback may be that we are unlikely to see this theme explored much further, since this is now officially the final season. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two wrote positively of the entry's plot—comparing it to the first season episode [...] "Squeeze" [...] and the fourth season episode [...] "The Field Where I Died"—calling the writing [...] "delightfully subtle". They praised Amann's misdirection, noting that the episode contains several red herrings. Shearman and Pearson also praised the episode's effects, calling the <b>skinless</b> bodies [...] "the high point of the series' trading in gore". M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, called the episode [...] "unexpectedly entertaining" [...] and praised the script's attempts to shed more light on Reyes' character.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Skinless</b> {{hot dogs}} vary in {{the texture of}} the product surface but have a softer [...] "bite" [...] than natural casing hot dogs. <b>Skinless</b> hot dogs are more uniform in shape and size than natural casing hot dogs and less expensive.|$|E
2500|$|The first <b>skinless</b> hot dog casings were {{produced}} by Freund's new company {{under the name}} [...] "Nojax", short for [...] "no jackets" [...] and sold to local Chicago sausage makers.|$|E
2500|$|The vast {{majority}} of Atlantic salmon available {{around the world are}} farmed (almost 99%), whereas the majority of Pacific salmon are wild-caught (greater than 80%). Canned salmon in the US is usually wild Pacific catch, though some farmed salmon is available in canned form. Smoked salmon is another popular preparation method, and can either be hot or cold smoked. Lox can refer to either cold-smoked salmon or salmon cured in a brine solution (also called gravlax). [...] Traditional canned salmon includes some skin (which is harmless) and bone (which adds calcium). <b>Skinless</b> and boneless canned salmon is also available.|$|E
2500|$|War from a Harlots Mouth {{was founded}} during 2005. Starting as a side-project {{consisting}} of three members only, including their vocalist, drummer and one guitarist, they recorded their first EP titled Falling Upstairs in cassette format during June 2006 with only 50 physical copies of it released. Later on that year, they released a CD/10" [...] Split with deathcore act Molotov Solution on Twelve Gauge Records. After finding a second guitarist and a bassist {{in the end}} of 2006, WFAHM joined the War of Attrition Tour in 2007, promoting the album of the same name by Dying Fetus, accompanying bands <b>Skinless</b> and Cattle Decapitation, also joining the stage for Never Say Die! Fest with bands Ion Dissonance, Dead to Fall, and Through the Eyes of the Dead. Also in 2007, the band joined Lifeforce Records and released their album Transmetropolitan in September. The band during these times gained a lot of notoriety in their home city due to their lead vocalist, Steffan Winopal's extremely screechy and [...] "dying" [...] sound he gave off in his screamed vocals, distinguishing the band from many others that played in a similar style. They were also one of the first groups to incorporate jazz influence into their heavy sound around their area.|$|E
60|$|She {{was curious}} to hear them, but, besides {{feeling that the}} topic {{concealed}} dangers better known to her than to him, she was reminded by his tone of his curious abstract declaration upon the Embankment. Anything that hinted at love for the moment alarmed her; it was as much an infliction to her as the rubbing of a <b>skinless</b> wound.|$|E
60|$|When Mauki was done, {{he carried}} the boat compass and all the rifles and {{ammunition}} down to the cutter, which he proceeded to ballast with cases of tobacco. It was while engaged in this that a hideous, <b>skinless</b> thing {{came out of the}} house and ran screaming down the beach till it fell in the sand and mowed and gibbered under the scorching sun. Mauki looked toward it and hesitated. Then he went over and removed the head, which he wrapped in a mat and stowed in the stern locker of the cutter.|$|E
6000|$|Friedrich, painfully made {{sensible}} what a <b>skinless</b> explosive Trismegistus {{he has got}} on hand, answers, I suppose, {{in words}} little or nothing,--in Letters, I observe, answers absolutely nothing, to Voltaire repeating and re-repeating;--does simply dismiss D'Arnaud (a [...] "BON DIABLE," [...] as Voltaire, to impartial people, calls him), or accept D'Arnaud's demission, and cut the poor fool adrift. Who sallies out into infinite space, to Paris latterly ("alive there in 1805"); and claims henceforth perpetual oblivion from us and mankind. And now there will be peace in our garden of the gods, and perpetual azure will return? ...|$|E
60|$|I lay for a space {{taking this}} in. I {{saw his face}} still bore evidences of emotion. For a while I said nothing. I passed an {{inquisitive}} hand over my contusions, and surveyed his face for similar damages. The back of my right hand had suffered most, and was <b>skinless</b> and raw. My forehead was bruised and had bled. He handed me a little measure {{with some of the}} restorative--I forget the name of it--he had brought with us. After a time I felt a little better. I began to stretch my limbs carefully. Soon I could talk.|$|E
60|$|It was a {{much larger}} cavern than we had {{supposed}} from our first glimpse of it, and we {{looked up from the}} lowest portion of its sloping floor. It widened out as it receded from us, and its roof came down and hid the remoter portion altogether. And lying in a line along its length, vanishing at last far away in that tremendous perspective, were a number of huge shapes, huge pallid hulls, upon which the Selenites were busy. At first they seemed big white cylinders of vague import. Then I noted the heads upon them lying towards us, eyeless and <b>skinless</b> like the heads of sheep at a butcher's, and perceived they were the carcasses of mooncalves being cut up, much as the crew of a whaler might cut up a moored whale. They were cutting off the flesh in strips, and on some of the farther trunks the white ribs were showing. It was the sound of their hatchets that made that chid, chid, chid. Some way away a thing like a trolley cable, drawn and loaded with chunks of lax meat, was running up the slope of the cavern floor. This enormous long avenue of hulls that were destined to be food gave us a sense of the vast populousness of the moon world second only to the effect of our first glimpse down the shaft.|$|E
6000|$|It was in Summer, 1762 (about {{three months}} after the above Letter from the King), that Rousseau made his celebrated exodus into Neufchatel Country, and found the old Governor so good to him,--glad to be allowed to shelter the poor <b>skinless</b> creature. And, mark as curious, it must have been on two of those mornings, {{towards the end of the}} Siege of Schweidnitz, when things were getting so intolerable, and at times {{breaking}} out into electricity, into [...] "rebuke all round," [...] that Friedrich received that singular pair of Laconic Notes from Rousseau in Neufchatel: forwarded, successively, by Lord Marischal; NOTE FIRST, of date, [...] "Motier-Travers, Neufchatel, September," [...] nobody can guess what day, [...] "1762:" [...] "I have said much ill of you, and don't repent it. Now everybody has banished me; and it is on your threshold that I sit down. Kill me, if you have a mind!" [...] And then (after, not death, but the gift of 100 crowns), NOTE SECOND, [...] "October, 1762:"... "Take out of my sight that sword, which dazzles and pains me; IT has only too well done its duty, while the sceptre is abandoned:" [...] Make Peace, can't you! [OEuvres completes de Rousseau (a Geneve, 1782-1789), xxxiii. 64, 65.]--What curious reading for a King in such posture, among the miscellaneous arrivals overnight! Above six weeks before either of these NOTES, Friedrich, hearing of him from Lord Marischal, had answered: [...] "An asylum? Yes, by all means: the unlucky cynic!" [...] It is on September 1st, that he sends, by the same channel, 100 crowns for his use, with advice to [...] "give them in NATURA, lest he refuse otherwise;" [...] as Friedrich knows to be possible. In words, the Rousseau Notes got nothing of Answer. [...] "A GARCON SINGULIER," [...] says Friedrich: odd fellow, yes indeed, your Majesty;--and has such a pungency of flattery in him too, presented in the way of snarl! His Majesty might take him, I suppose, with a kind of relish, like Queen-Dowager snuff.|$|E
60|$|At Basle we {{were joined}} by my brother Alfred, now a handsome, self-confident man of six-and-twenty--a {{thorough}} contrast to my fragile, nervous, ineffectual self. I believe I was held to {{have a sort of}} half- womanish, half-ghostly beauty; for the portrait-painters, who are thick as weeds at Geneva, had often asked me to sit to them, and I had been the model of a dying minstrel in a fancy picture. But I thoroughly disliked my own physique and nothing but the belief that it was a condition of poetic genius would have reconciled me to it. That brief hope was quite fled, and I saw in my face now nothing but the stamp of a morbid organization, framed for passive suffering--too feeble for the sublime resistance of poetic production. Alfred, from whom I had been almost constantly separated, and who, in his present stage of character and appearance, came before me as a perfect stranger, was bent on being extremely friendly and brother-like to me. He had the superficial kindness of a good-humoured, self-satisfied nature, that fears no rivalry, and has encountered no contrarieties. I am not sure that my disposition was good enough for me to have been quite free from envy towards him, even if our desires had not clashed, and if I had been in the healthy human condition which admits of generous confidence and charitable construction. There must always have been an antipathy between our natures. As it was, he became in a few weeks an object of intense hatred to me; and when he entered the room, still more when he spoke, {{it was as if a}} sensation of grating metal had set my teeth on edge. My diseased consciousness was more intensely and continually occupied with his thoughts and emotions, than with those of any other person who came in my way. I was perpetually exasperated with the petty promptings of his conceit and his love of patronage, with his self-complacent belief in Bertha Grant's passion for him, with his half- pitying contempt for me--seen not in the ordinary indications of intonation and phrase and slight action, which an acute and suspicious mind is on the watch for, but in all their naked <b>skinless</b> complication.|$|E

In June 2010, <b>Skinless</b> played a reunion show with the line-up {{from the first}} 2 full-length albums. Guitarist Noah Carpenter wanted <b>Skinless</b> to continue in this formation but the band's [...] "fire" [...] wasn't there anymore.
