50|$|Ice Protection {{with the}} TKS Ice Protection system is {{achieved}} by mounting laser-drilled titanium porous panels on the leading edges of the airframe. The panel skin is perforated with eight hundred 0.0025-inch-diameter laser-drilled holes per square inch. TKS fluid exudes through the panels on the leading edges of the wings, horizontal stabilizers. Fluid is also thoroughly distributed from the slinger-ring on the propeller and from the windshield spraybar. Secondary fairings or structures such as lift struts can also be protected. Engine inlets may be protected, as well. The fluid is pumped from a tank by an electrically-driven metering pump through a microfilter to proportioning units. Proportioning units contain calibrated capillary tubes that divide the flow to the individual needs of the porous panels and the <b>slinger</b> <b>ring.</b> One metering pump is provided for inadvertent systems. For systems certified for flight into known icing conditions (FIKI), two pumps are installed for redundancy and can be selected individually. Fluid for the windshield spraybar system is provided by an on-demand gear pump. One or two windshield pumps are provided depending on the certification basis. As the TKS Ice Protection system is used, any accumulation of debris is flushed out. Glycol has cleaning properties and will not harm the paint finish of the aircraft. No performance is lost from the system; only significant ice protection capabilities are added.|$|E

When lubricating rolling element bearings, four basic strategies have historically been employed: Grease lubrication; Oil bath lubrication; Oil lubrication via slinger disc or oil ring; Oil mist lubrication. For high speed (3000 RPM and higher), slinger discs or oil rings are commonly used due to the short re-greasing interval exhibited with grease lubrication and the high heat generation due to churning seen with oil bath lubrication. This paper seeks to reprise the work of Lemmon & Booser, Heshmat & Pinkus, Gardner and Ettles et al in defining the equations of performance related to oil slinger discs and oil rings. It will then {{address some of the}} operational and reliability concerns of each of these oiling methods using a purpose built test rig that is representative of {{the current state of the}} art in bearing housing design for pumps. Specifically it will look at how the following parameters affect oil delivery and stability: Rotational speed; Bearing housing inclination; Oil <b>ring</b> material; <b>Slinger</b> geometry; <b>Slinger</b> and oil <b>ring</b> submergence depth...|$|R
