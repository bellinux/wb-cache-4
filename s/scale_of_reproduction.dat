50|$|The {{constancy}} of a'/a {{necessary for}} this relation to hold {{was pointed out}} by R. H. Bow (Brit. Journ. Photog., 1861), and Thomas Sutton (Photographic Notes, 1862); it has been treated by O. Lummer and by M. von Rohr (Zeit. f. Instrumentenk., 1897, 17, and 1898, 18, p. 4). It requires {{the middle of the}} aperture stop to be reproduced in the centers of the entrance and exit pupils without spherical aberration. M. von Rohr showed that for systems fulfilling neither the Airy nor the Bow-Sutton condition, the ratio a' cos w'/a tan w will be constant for one distance of the object. This combined condition is exactly fulfilled by holosymmetrical objectives reproducing with the scale 1, and by hemisymmetrical, if the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> be equal to the ratio of the sizes of the two components.|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this article}} is to {{identify}} the selected factors shaping the reproduction processes of farms conducting agricultural accountancy (FADN). It has been recognized that the higher indicator of reproduction, in the analysed groups, is accompanied by greater resources of land, labour and capital. The reproduction processes are dependent on the business outlook conditions, but resource factors are relatively independent of them. There is a diverse range of processes of reproduction between the various components of assets. The relatively high level of reproduction of assets in the case of machinery and transportation equipment, and for building substance remains at a very low level. Education of head of households has also diversifi ed the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> processes.

40|$|Shaded relief maps {{provide an}} {{appealing}} visualization of landforms and hilly terrain. This paper considers {{two aspects of}} their construction: simplification of terrain, and effective feature depiction through exaggerated shading. Simplification involves choosing a level-of-detail appropriate to the <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> and the desired emphasis of the map. We will model this process as a digital filtering operation applied to regularly sampled elevation data. Hill shading techniques for indicating terrain slope have seemed natural candidates for automation using bump-mapping. However, naïve application of bump mapping to elevation data fails to reproduce the distinctive character of hill shading painted by a skilled cartographer. Examples of manual hill shading often feature idealized shading that emphasizes conceptually important terrain features like ridge lines. We treat this as a nonphotorealistic rendering problem, and propose a new shading model that attempts to model this illustrative technique...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — There {{are various}} {{discussions on the}} {{evolution}} of cooperation on different pairs of interaction network for playing games and the replacement network for imitation of strategies. This paper aims at clarifying the topological relationship between these networks that facilitates the evolution of cooperation by focusing on the intensity of selection for imitation process of strategies. We constructed an agent-based model of the evolutionary prisoner’s dilemma on different pairs of interaction and replacement networks. The relationship between these networks can be adjusted by the scale of interaction and reproduction, and the intensity of selection can be adjusted from the almost deterministic selection of the best strategy to the extremely stochastic selection. The evolutionary experiments showed that the larger <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> than the scale of interaction brought about higher level cooperation when the intensity of selection was high, and the minimum scale of interaction and reproduction was the best for the evolution of cooperation when the intensity of selection was low.

40|$|Freshwater mussels (Bivalvia:Unionidae) {{are among}} the most imperiled organisms in North America. Information on the spatial <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> and {{population}} connectivity will better enable mussel conservation programs to sustain long-term population viability, particularly restocking and recovery programs. Here we used genetic methods to characterize population structure, dispersal potential, and reproductive strategies in the freshwater mussel Lampsilis cardium from Twin Creek and Big Darby Creek (Ohio, USA). We genotyped adults and individual glochidia at 12 microsatellite loci to assess local population structure relative to within-population patterns of relatedness and parentage. Local populations within watersheds were weakly structured, and within-population estimates of relatedness identified probable full- and half-siblings several kilometers apart. Parent–offspring comparisons provided evidence of multiple paternity in single broods and identified the likely father of 3 glochidia from 1 female 2 ̆ 7 s brood 16. 2 km upstream of the mother, indicating that long-distance transport of spermatozoa can promote population connectivity within watersheds. Given that lampsilines and other unionoids exhibit similar reproductive strategies, it is possible that other species are capable of long-distance fertilization. If so, fertilization in populations of many freshwater mussels might not be limited by local density of breeding adults. Therefore, the prospects for recovery of imperiled freshwater mussels might be better than what is now expected...|$|E

40|$|An {{allometric}} {{framework is}} used to construct a model for seed plant annual reproductive biomass based on standing leaf, stem and root biomass. According to this model, the <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> is governed by numerous taxon-specific scaling exponents and constants that reflect the allometry of vegetative biomass partitioning. Although this allometry cannot be predicted a priori, the model accurately predicts all observed inter- and intraspecific repro-ductive biomass trends based on the exponents and constants determined for a worldwide database representative of herbaceous and tree-sized dicot, monocot and conifer species grow-ing in diverse habitats. The model also identifies the body proportions for which reproduction is energetically untenable. The limits for seed plant reproductive biomass are thus established, providing a conceptual and quantitative basis for understanding the <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> reproductive capacity across and within ecologically and evolutionarily diverse spermatophytes...|$|R

50|$|The {{result is}} {{a copy of the}} {{original}} image with the clear background area rendered dark blue and the image reproduced as a white line. The image is stable. The contact printing process has the advantage that no large-field optical system is required. A further advantage is that the reproduced document will have the same scale as the original. Another quality is that the dark blue background makes it difficult to add new information to the print (such as recording as-built changes); a blueprint cannot easily be altered—depending on the situation, this can be either a strength or a drawback. Since the paper is soaked in liquid during processing, a minor change <b>of</b> <b>scale</b> can occur, and the paper can also become brittle.

In 1953 Duncan Grant was commissioned to decorate Lincoln Cathedral’s Russell Chantry {{with a set}} of murals depicting St Blaise, the patron saint of wool workers. The mural unveiled in 1959 remained private for a number of years, possibly because Duncan Grant chose to put a little too much of his own life onto the walls, being reopened for public view after restoration in 1990. The murals were painted at a time in British art history when mural painting was far more likely to occur on secular or municipal buildings and it is partly this that makes Grant's chapel murals a rarity.
