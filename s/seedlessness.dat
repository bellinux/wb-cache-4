50|$|<b>Seedlessness</b> {{is seen as}} a {{desirable}} trait in edible fruit with hard seeds such as banana, pineapple, orange and grapefruit. Parthenocarpy is also desirable in fruit crops that may be difficult to pollinate or fertilize, such as fig, tomato and summer squash. In dioecious species, such as persimmon, parthenocarpy increases fruit production because staminate trees {{do not need to be}} planted to provide pollen. Parthenocarpy is undesirable in nut crops, such as pistachio, where the seed is the edible part. Horticulturists have selected and propagated parthenocarpic cultivars of many plants, including banana, fig, cactus pear (Opuntia), breadfruit and eggplant. Some plants, such as pineapple, produce seedless fruits when a single cultivar is grown because they are self-infertile. Some cucumbers produce seedless fruit if pollinators are excluded. Strange as it seems, seedless watermelon plants are grown from seeds. The seeds are produced by crossing a diploid parent with a tetraploid parent to produce triploid seeds.|$|E

These QTLs explain 25. 0 - 55. 7 % and 54. 0 - 62., 4 % of the total variance, respectively. The MIKCC-Type MADS box gene VvAG 3, whose orthologue is involved in Arabidopsis carpel and ovule development, and located in the confidence interval of the <b>seedlessness</b> QTL detected on the LG 18, could be considered as a candidate gene to control seed development in grape. Colocalizations were found in the same region, between the position of the Rpv 3 locus, which is very rich in TIR-NBS-LRR genes, and the main QTL identified for downy mildew resistance.

40|$|Background: The {{phytohormone}} {{gibberellic acid}} (GA 3) {{is widely used}} in the table grape industry to induce <b>seedlessness</b> in seeded varieties. However, there is a paucity of information concerning the mechanisms by which GAs induce <b>seedlessness</b> in grapes. Methodology/Principal Findings: In an effort to systematically analyze {{the cause of this}} GA 3 -induced seed abortion, we conducted an in depth characterization of two seeded grape cultivars (‘Kyoho ’ and ‘Red Globe’), along with a seedless cultivar (‘Thompson Seedless’), following treatment with GA 3. In a similar fashion to the seedless control, which exhibited GA 3 -induced abortion of the seeds 9 days after full bloom (DAF), both ‘Kyoho ’ and ‘Red Globe ’ seeded varieties exhibited complete abortion of the seeds 15 DAF when treated with GA 3. Morphological analyses indicated that while fertilization appeared to occur normally following GA 3 treatment, {{as well as in the}} untreated seedless control cultivar, seed growth eventually ceased. In addition, we found that GA 3 application had an effect on redox homeostasis, which could potentially cause cell damage and subsequent seed abortion. Furthermore, we carried out an analysis of antioxidant enzyme activities, as well as transcript levels from various genes believed to be involved in seed development, and found several differences between GA 3 -treated and untreated controls.

40|$|Abstract Background Stenospermocarpy is a {{mechanism}} through which certain genotypes of Vitis vinifera L. such as Sultanina produce berries with seeds reduced in size. Stenospermocarpy {{has not yet}} been characterized at the molecular level. Results Genetic and physical maps were integrated with the public genomic sequence of Vitis vinifera L. to improve QTL analysis for <b>seedlessness</b> and berry size in experimental progeny derived from a cross of two seedless genotypes. Major QTLs co-positioning for both traits on chromosome 18 defined a 92 -kb confidence interval. Functional information from model species including Vitis suggested that VvAGL 11, included in this confidence interval, might be the main positional candidate gene responsible for seed and berry development. Characterization of VvAGL 11 at the sequence level in the experimental progeny identified several SNPs and INDELs in both regulatory and coding regions. In association analyses performed over three seasons, these SNPs and INDELs explained up to 78 % and 44 % of the phenotypic variation in seed and berry weight, respectively. Moreover, genetic experiments indicated that the regulatory region has a larger effect on the phenotype than the coding region. Transcriptional analysis lent additional support to the putative role of VvAGL 11 's regulatory region, as its expression is abolished in seedless genotypes at key stages of seed development. These results transform VvAGL 11 into a functional candidate gene for further analyses based on genetic transformation. For breeding purposes, intragenic markers were tested individually for marker assisted selection, and the best markers were those closest to the transcription start site. Conclusion We propose that VvAGL 11 is the major functional candidate gene for <b>seedlessness,</b> and we provide experimental evidence suggesting that the seedless phenotype might be caused by variations in its promoter region. Current knowledge of the function of its orthologous genes, its expression profile in Vitis varieties and the strong association between its sequence variation and the degree of <b>seedlessness</b> together indicate that the D-lineage MADS-box gene VvAGL 11 corresponds to the Seed Development Inhibitor locus described earlier as a major locus for <b>seedlessness.</b> These results provide new hypotheses for further investigations of the molecular mechanisms involved in seed and berry development. </p...|$|E
