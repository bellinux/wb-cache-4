5|$|In Africa, the warbler eats insects {{as well as}} berries, and {{the fruits}} of the {{introduced}} <b>Spanish</b> <b>flag</b> is a favourite where present. An increase in body mass occurs again before the northward migration, birds fattening even more rapidly than prior to their southward journey. Most internal organs (including the liver, spleen, intestines, kidneys and heart) and the flight muscles lose weight during the journey over the Sahara, although the testes quadruple in mass in preparation for the breeding season. Unlike drier-habitat species like the common whitethroat, they leave from savanna rather than the treeless Sahel further north.|$|E
5|$|Alfonso XIII {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Sociedad Española de Construcción Naval {{shipyard}} in Ferrol on 23 February 1910. She was launched on 7 May 1913, and completed on 16 August 1915. After their completion, Alfonso XIII and her sisters, España and Jaime I, the three battleships formed the 1st Squadron of the Spanish fleet. Spain remained neutral after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, so Alfonso XIII and her sisters were the only European dreadnoughts to avoid the war. In August 1917, Alfonso XIII assisted in the suppression of general strikes in Vizcaya and Bilbao. After {{the end of the}} war, Alfonso XIII conducted cruises to show the flag, including a visit to Annapolis, Maryland, in 1920, during which , a former Spanish Navy cruiser captured by the United States during the Spanish–American War in 1898, flew the <b>Spanish</b> <b>flag</b> to honor her visit.|$|E
5|$|The Gloucester was {{the first}} ship to set anchor in the Bay of Guánica. Twenty-eight sailors and Marines, {{under the command of}} Lieutenants H. P. Huse and Wood, {{departed}} from the ship on rafts and landed on the beach. The Marines lowered the <b>Spanish</b> <b>flag</b> from the beach flagpole and replaced it with the American flag. They then proceeded to set up a machine gun nest and placed barbed wire around their perimeter. The first land skirmish in Puerto Rico between the Puerto Rican militia and the American forces occurred when Lt. Méndez López and his men attacked and opened fire on the Americans. During the small battle which followed, the Americans returned fire with their machine gun and the Gloucester began to bombard the Spanish position. Lt. Méndez López and three of his men were wounded and the militia unit was forced to retreat to the town of Yauco.|$|E

50|$|The Iberian {{flag was}} created by the Catalan diplomat and writer Sinibaldo de Mas i Sans in 1854. It is {{quartered}} with the colours of the monarchist Portuguese (blue and white) and <b>Spanish</b> <b>flags</b> (red and yellow), dating from 1830 and 1785 respectively. The Iberian flag is older than the republican <b>Spanish</b> and Portuguese <b>flags</b> (1931 and 1911 respectively).|$|R

5|$|At Villa Imperial, one of {{the richest}} cities of Upper Peru, an open cabildo called on Goyeneche to {{withdraw}} from their territory. He obeyed, as {{he did not have the}} military strength to prevail. The Bishop of La Paz, Remigio La Santa y Ortega, fled with him. Castelli was received in Potosí and requesting that the locals swear allegiance to the Junta. He also requested that the royalist generals Francisco de Paula Sanz and José de Córdoba y Rojas submit to him. He made arrangements that the operation to capture Vicente Nieto should be carried out exclusively by the surviving members of the Regiment of Patricians from the mines of Potosi, who had been incorporated with honors into the Army of the North. Sanz, Nieto, and Córdoba were executed at the Plaza of Potosí. Nieto claimed that he died happy, because it was under the <b>Spanish</b> <b>flag.</b> Goyeneche and Ortega, on the other hand, were safe on royalist land. Bernardo Monteagudo, inmate at the Jail of the Court of Chuquisaca for his participation in the revolution of 1809, escaped to join the ranks of the army. Castelli, who already knew Monteagudo's background, appointed him his secretary.|$|E

25|$|After {{the combat}} in El Realejo, the Argentines {{found the same}} {{schooner}} with the <b>Spanish</b> <b>flag</b> that they had lost in San Blas. The ship went forward towards the Santa Rosa, whose crew was composed of inexpert Hawaiian sailors and had few artillery. A first attack killed three Argentines and wounded many more. When the Argentine ship was going to repel the enemy's boarding, the schooner took out the <b>Spanish</b> <b>flag</b> and showed it was a Chilean ship, called Chileno (Chilean). It was commanded by a corsair whose surname was Croll. Bouchard demanded that his surgeon heal the wounded, but the Chilean corsair decided to go away.|$|E
25|$|During the Viceroyalty of Peru, the colonial-era <b>Spanish</b> <b>flag</b> {{flew over}} Peru. In 1820, during the {{struggle}} for independence, British-born General William Miller hoisted in Tacna the first flag that represented the emerging country. Though the original flag itself is now lost, it was described as navy blue, defaced with a golden sun representing Inti.|$|E

25|$|Neptune was a Bucentaure-class 80-gun ship of {{the line}} of the French Navy.

25|$|In 1730 he {{returned}} to Spain and was promoted to chief of the Mediterranean Fleet; with this force {{he went to the}} Republic of Genoa to enforce the payment of two million pesos owed to Spain that had been retained in the Bank of San Jorge.

25|$|Then on 25 September 1801 a {{privateer}} hoisting the <b>Spanish</b> <b>flag</b> unsuccessfully engaged Pickle in a single-ship {{action that}} resulted in the death of her commander, Lieutenant Greenshields, and the wounding of Midshipman Pierce, the master, Thomas Hayer, and seven others of her crew. At 11am, some five or six miles NW of the Isle of Ash (aka Île à Vache or Cow Island, south of Hispaniola), Pickle sighted a vessel flying the British flag and sailing towards it. When the vessel got within pistol-shot, he hauled up the <b>Spanish</b> <b>flag</b> and opened fire. The fight lasted an hour and a quarter, with a musket ball through the body killing Greenshields about 40 minutes in. The Spanish vessel then tried to board Pickle, but when the Spaniard was unable to do so, he fled. Pickle chased the privateer {{for an hour and a}} half but the privateer was faster and Pickle gave up the chase. Hayer, who wrote the report of the action, described the privateer as having two 12-pounder and two 9-pounder guns, and a crew of about 70 men. Pickle had a crew of 35, of whom three were incapacitated by illness.|$|E
25|$|In 1777, two American frigates, the Endowok and the Henry, {{took refuge}} in Mayagüez Bay as to evade attack from the British ship HMS Glasgow.

He was able to destroy a number of forts in Cotabato and gain for the <b>Spanish</b> <b>flag</b> Sarangani Bay by June 1886. On March 10, 1888, Datu Uto signed a peace treaty with the Spaniards.|$|E
25|$|On April 14, 1864, in {{retaliation}} for Peru's refusal to pay an indemnity, the Spanish fleet seized the lightly defended Chincha Islands. The islands were the principal source for Peruvian guano resources. The Spanish placed the islands' Peruvian governor Ramón Valle Riestra under arrest aboard the Resolución, occupied the islands with 400 marines, and raised the <b>Spanish</b> <b>flag.</b> Spain considered these islands an important bargaining tool, as they were a major Peruvian economic asset and produced almost 60% of the government's annual revenue.|$|E
25|$|By sunset, the two British {{ships were}} within long {{range of the}} unknown ships. Observateur fired a warning shot in their {{direction}} and both she and Junon moved to close with the lead frigate preparatory to engaging them. However, as the British ships approached, the lead frigate ran up a <b>Spanish</b> <b>flag,</b> shortly followed by the British Red Ensign. Believing the unknown ships to be Spanish allies, Wetherall and Shortland reduced sail and Junon moved to come alongside the lead frigate to permit Captain Shortland to exchange greetings with her captain.|$|E

60|$|The Spanish gunboats that lured the Winslow {{into the}} death-trap were the Antonio Lopez, Lealtad, and Ligera.
