In the novel, she was disguised as the American-flagged <b>Seabee</b> <b>carrier</b> Doctor Lykes and used to transport Soviet troops to Keflavik, Iceland. In order to conform with the slightly different silhouette of the Lykes Lines ship, parts of her superstructure were removed and the shape of the funnels was altered with prefabricated parts. Furthermore, the twenty-foot Interlighter markings {{on the side of the}} ship were painted over and replaced with [...] "Lykes Lines," [...] and the white L on a blue diamond of the Lykes Brothers Steamship Company emblem was added on the forward superstructure.|$|E
