In {{developing}} countries {{the framework for}} institutional engagement in small-scale fishing communities needs to consider the regional, social, economic and environmental complexities of informal resource-based economies. The combination of socio-economic trajectory of artisanal fisherfolks, {{their relationship with the}} environment, the economic pressures and the public policy framework, which often regarded fishing communities as desolate and in a permanent state of deficiency, resulted in a paradigm that reinforced social exclusion and further degradation of the environment. This context is further aggravated by gender inequalities, which turn the role of fisherwomen in small scale fisheries and community development invisible. Within this negatively charged context, the challenge of fostering a socially just, environmentally sustainable and economically viable livelihood relies on institutional interventions that are able to identify the endogenous potential for change within the community. As such, a community-based development approach aims to build opportunities for multi-stakeholder engagement to socially embed the economic and resource-management tools. The paper describes the conceptual framework and the participatory methodology applied by the "Gente da Maré" (The People of the Tide) Project in Brazil. This methodology involves the participatory development of value chain mapping and economic feasibility study towards sustainable livelihoods for <b>small-scale</b> <b>coastal</b> <b>fishing</b> communities. A special focus is placed on the "marisqueiras" – shell fisherwomen that live from the extraction of clams and oysters in coastal communities spread across Brazil‘s North-eastern Region, {{as well as on the}} intervening institutions. The paper concludes with reflections on the community-based inter-institutional approach to participatory value chain mapping and economic feasibility studies, the challenges that lay ahead in the application of participatory economic development tools and on future directions for further research...|$|E
40|$|Climate {{variability}} {{and change}} are predicted to impact on coastal and marine smallscale fisheries and dependent communities. They have been {{adapted to the}} normal range of climate variability and its impacts, but additional adaptation {{will be required to}} address the increased impacts of climate change. Migration is regarded as one strategy to adapt to these impacts but debates surround its successfulness. Fishing communities can adapt in many ways and migration is one example. However, limits and barriers can prevent adaptation being successful or reduce vulnerability. Studies on vulnerability, adaptation and limits and barriers to adaptation are therefore preconditions for the fishing communities to develop effective adaptation strategies to face climate variability and change. Despite considerable studies on the impact of climate change on aquatic ecosystems and fish stocks, the macro scale fishery-dependent economies and their people, and on vulnerability and adaptation in agricultural communities, there has been insufficient examination of the vulnerability and adaptation of small-scale fishing communities to climate variability and change. This thesis therefore assesses the vulnerability and adaptation to the impacts of climate variability and change, in three <b>small-scale</b> <b>coastal</b> <b>fishing</b> communities in Bangladesh. Using a mixed method approach, particular focus is given to the assessment of livelihood vulnerability, the investigation of the outcomes of climate induced migration, and the exploration of limits of and barriers to adaptation. Results highlight that the level of livelihood vulnerability not only differs between communities but also between different household groups within a community, depending on their level of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. Exposure to floods and cyclones; sensitivity (such as dependence on small-scale marine fisheries for livelihoods); and lack of adaptive capacity in terms of physical, natural and financial capital and diverse livelihood strategies construe livelihood vulnerability in different ways depending on the context. Results show that the most exposed community is not necessarily the most sensitive or least able to adapt because livelihood vulnerability is a result of combined but unequal influences of biophysical and socio-economic characteristics of communities and households. Within a fishing community, where households are similarly exposed, higher sensitivity and lower adaptive capacity combine to create higher vulnerability. Migration may be a viable strategy to respond to climate variability and change. Results show that migration has generated several positive outcomes for households that resettled. The resettled households are now less exposed to floods, sea level rise and land erosion than those who stayed behind. They have also more livelihood assets and better access to them. They enjoy higher incomes, better health, better access to water supply, health and educational services, technology and markets than the households who remained in their original settlement. The thesis also establishes that fishing communities face multiple limits and barriers to adaptation of fishing activities to cyclones, however. Limits include physical characteristics of climate and sea, such as higher frequency and duration of cyclones, and hidden sandbars. Barriers include technologically poor boats, inaccurate weather forecasts, poor radio signals, lack of access to credit, low incomes, underestimation of cyclone occurrence, coercion of fishermen by the boat owners and captains, lack of education, skills and livelihood alternatives, unfavourable credit schemes, lack of enforcement of fishing regulations and maritime laws, and lack of access to fish markets. These local and wider scale factors interact in complex ways and constrain completion of fishing trips, coping with cyclones at sea, safe return of boats from sea, timely responses to cyclones and livelihood diversification. Overall, this thesis contributes empirical evidence to current debates in the literature on climate change by enhancing an understanding of the characteristics and determinants of livelihood vulnerability, migration as an adaptation strategy and limits and barriers to the adaptation of fishing communities to climate variability and change. The findings of this thesis form the basis for further detailed research into the vulnerability and adaptation of small-scale fishing communities to climate variability and change. Based on the above findings, this thesis also provides some suggestions for reducing vulnerability and for developing effective adaptation strategies...|$|E
40|$|Healthy <b>coastal</b> <b>fish</b> {{stocks and}} {{communities}} comprise {{an important part}} of the environmental targets of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and Baltic Sea Action Plan, both in Sweden and the Baltic Sea as a whole. As such, the status of fish communities along our coasts should be assessed and Good Environmental Status (GES) should be achieved in 2020 by using a suite of selected indicators. Many <b>coastal</b> <b>fish</b> stocks in the Baltic Sea are typically local in their appearance and response to environmental conditions. In spite of a well-developed <b>coastal</b> <b>fish</b> monitoring program in Sweden, there are still spatial gaps in its coverage limiting the potential for a full comprehensive status assessment of <b>coastal</b> <b>fish.</b> Within the commercial fishery, all fishermen are obliged to report the catches and effort of their fishery to the European Commission via daily logbooks. To date, however, the information gathered from the <b>small-scale</b> <b>coastal</b> fisheries has not been used to assess the status and development of <b>coastal</b> <b>fish</b> stocks and communities. In this report we assess the potential for using data collected within the <b>small-scale</b> <b>coastal</b> fishery for indicator development and status assessments of <b>coastal</b> <b>fish</b> by 1) screening the species targeted and gears used in the commercial fishery, 2) comparing the temporal development of indicators derived from the commercial fishery and fishery independent <b>coastal</b> <b>fish</b> monitoring, and 3) comparing the outcome of status assessments derived from indicators developed using the two sources of data. Our results show that the commercial coastal fishery in Sweden is mainly targeting cod, herring, whitefish, flounder and perch, and to a minor extent also pike and pike-perch. These species are mainly caught using gillnets, but in some areas traps or trap-nets are of importance. Catches of species of noncommercial value as roach and breams and other members of the carp family are very low or not registered, and the data is hence limited to a few species of commercial importance. We found an overall weak match and substantial variation across coastal areas between indicators derived from the commercial fishery and fisheries independent monitoring data. There was, however, a reasonable concordance between the Abundance of large perch (above 25 cm) from monitoring data and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) of perch in the commercial fishery. When assessing the environmental status of the fish communities based on indicators derived from the two sources of data, there was a rather good overall match in GES for the indicators Abundance of perch, Abundance of large perch and Abundance of piscivores and CPUE based indicators from the commercial fishery. The match was lower for the indicator Abundance of large piscivores and indicators ignoring effort data in the commercial fishery. Our results suggest that CPUE data from the coastal commercial fishery could potentially be used as a complement and give additional support for status assessments of <b>coastal</b> <b>fish</b> in Sweden, particularly for the indicator Abundance of large perch. Since no information on size structure or the abundance of species of low commercial value could be obtained from the coastal commercial fisheries statistics, the data reported is in its current form of limited use for more detailed assessments of <b>coastal</b> <b>fish</b> communities. This regards important parameters such as size structure and the abundance of important functional groups as carp fishes. The fisheries statistics includes many sources for potential errors, but there are some means that can be used to increase the value of this data for assessments. The quality of the reporting can be improved, a selected number of coastal fishermen can be contracted for more detailed self-reporting of their catches and efforts. It is especially important to focus on registration of by-catch (both undersized fish of focal species and species of non-commercial value), subsampling for length and age estimates, and improved resolution of the effort and fishing location. This would be especially valid for those species and stocks that we have limited information on in the fishery independent gillnet monitoring programs as for example whitefish, pike-perch, pike and flatfishes...|$|R
40|$|Continuous {{intensification}} of aquaculture production {{has brought about}} environmental issues associated with eutrophication worldwide. Environmental deterioration such as hypoxia and sulfide production due to water and sediment eutrophication originating from aquaculture effluents have been problematic, resulting to sporadic disease outbreaks and fish kills in the Philippines. Integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) {{is one of the}} promising methods for sustainable aquaculture as it also provides a supplementary source of income to the fish farmers. IMTA is a polyculture system that integrates culturing of fed species (e. g. finfish) the main commodity, organic extractive species (e. g. deposit and filter feeding benthos) and inorganic extractive species (e. g. seaweed). In this study, IMTA techniques were established for <b>small-scale</b> <b>coastal</b> <b>fish</b> farmers in the Philippines, with sea cucumber (Holothuria scabra, commonly known as sandfish), as the key species. Sandfish commands the highest price in tropical sea cucumber species. Nitrogen (N) budget of sandfish in polyculture with milkfish (Chanos chanos) and Elkhorn sea moss (Kappaphycus alvarezii), both of which are commonly cultured in the Philippines, was estimated using a simple closed box model. Information on stocking density, stocking size, mortality, growth, feed ration, feed assimilation, NH 4 -N production and NH 4 -N absorption of these species was obtained from a series of experiments and existing literature. Culture conditions were as follows: 26 g milkfish were cultured in a 5 x 5 x 4 m cage at an average stocking density of 36. 7 ind/m 3 (i. e. usual practice in the Philippines) with an initial feeding ration of 10 % of body weight which was gradually decreased to 4 % over time; 10 g sandfish were cultured in a 5 x 5 x 0. 3 m cage hung under the milkfish cage to trap particulate N waste (i. e. feces and leftover feed) from milkfish culture at a stocking density of 35 ind/m 2; the stocking weight of Elkhorn sea moss line culture was 10 kg. The culture period was 200 days. It was estimated that milkfish culture under the above-mentioned schemes cumulatively produced 145 kg of particulate N, and milkfish and sandfish together excreted 60 kg of NH 4 -N in 200 days of culture. Daily assimilation rate of the particulate N by sandfish ranged from 3. 4 to 12. 4 %, and 6. 4 % of the particulate N was estimated to be removed by sandfish during the entire 200 days of culture. Daily absorption rate of NH 4 -N by Elkhorn sea moss increased exponentially with time and reached 100 % at 125 days of culture. Cumulative NH 4 -N from milkfish and sandfish excretion was estimated to be depleted by 162 days of culture. For complete utilization of particulate N by sandfish by the end of milkfish culture period (i. e. zero emission), sandfish stocking density should be 805 ind/m 2, which is 200 times as high as that in existing sandfish aquaculture operations in countries such as Viet Nam and New Caledonia. The purpose of sandfish culture in IMTA should be emphasized in terms of its economic advantages and not very much on environmental integrity. Cages for sandfish culture should be designed in such a way where {{only a small fraction of}} organic matter from milkfish culture (i. e. about 6 % in this culture scheme) enters it to avoid sediment quality deterioration and possible death of sandfish. Elkhorn sea moss on the other hand seems very efficient in bioremediation capability...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the lack of}} knowledge production on impacts of new marine industries on coastal Sami culture in the Norwegian coastal zone. It asks how Sami culture matters in contemporary Norwegian marine governance, and discusses how ecosystem mapping practices facilitate knowledge production on Sami relations {{and use of the}} marine environment. This is done through five papers and a film, focusing on the Porsanger and Lyngen fjords in northern Norway, analyzing 1) the characteristics of Sami fisheries and seascapes, 2) how Sami fisheries are enacted through fisheries management and Sami rights mapping practices, and 3) how knowledge is produced about Sami culture and how it is represented in ecosystem governance. What can be observed in the period since 1989 is a diversification and polarization of the <b>coastal</b> <b>small-scale</b> <b>fishing</b> fleet ranging from the very small-scale to the full-fledged industrial <b>coastal</b> <b>fishing</b> vessel. Fisheries governance practices as well as Sami rights mapping practices however tend to enact an image of Sami culture as uniform and having the same needs and challenges independent of social and ecological contexts, which is materialized in universal solutions to the whole population in the Sami settlement area. Current ethno-ecological governance mapping practices offer an image of Sami culture as connected to vulnerable and valuable ethno-ecological spaces to be protected from environmental threats. This materializes ethno-ecological seascapes, but it does little to materialize cultural diversity and multiple knowledge products in the coastal zone. These are mainly the Marine Resource Act (2009), the Nature Diversity Act (2009) and the Planning and Building Act (2008), following the increased political influence of the Sami Parliament through the Consultation Agreement (2005). The thesis identifies alternative local knowledge production practices as remedial actions for increasing the knowledge base on how culture and coastal societies are impacted by new industries in the coastal zone...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{common dentex}} Dentex dentex (Linnaeus, 1758) is an iconic marine <b>coastal</b> <b>fish</b> in the Mediterranean Sea. It is a {{demersal}} sparid fish (0 – 200 m), that grows {{to a maximum}} length of 100 cm and a weight of 13 kg, with a relatively long life span (more than 20 years). As a high trophic level predator, it holds a key position in coastal marine food webs. The common dentex is of great economic importance for both artisanal (<b>small-scale</b> <b>coastal</b> fisheries) and recreational fishing. Despite its economic and ecological importance, scientific data on this species in its natural environment are still very scant. The global commercial catch of common dentex has fluctuated over the last 60 years on an interannual time scale, and has declined significantly since the 1990 s. There are few data regarding fishing effort and total catch from recreational fishing for common dentex, {{but it appears that}} this species is particularly targeted by this activity. The common dentex is now classified as ‘‘vulnerable’’ in the Red List of Threatened Species in the Mediterranean Sea. This review summarizes the current literature on D. dentex in regard to biology, ecology, parasitology, population structure, commercial and recreational fishing, and management regulations.
