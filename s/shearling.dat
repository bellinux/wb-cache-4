500|$|Costume {{designer}} Lindy Hemming {{explained that}} Bane uses a mask to inhale an analgesic gas, which, in director Christopher Nolan's words, [...] "keeps his pain {{just below the}} threshold so he can function." [...] In designing Bane's costume, Hemming needed it to look [...] "like an amalgam {{of all sorts of}} bits and pieces he cobbled together, as he passed through some very remote places. We made parts of his vest, for example, from fragments of an old military tent. His clothes are militaristic, but are not in any way a uniform." [...] Hemming also designed Bane's mask to look [...] "animalistic". Costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard created a three-dimensional model of actor Tom Hardy's face and skull to design the mask, allowing the mask to perfectly conform to the contours of Hardy's face. Hemming personally designed Bane's coat, which she admitted took two years to complete. Taking inspiration from a Swedish army jacket and a frock coat from the French Revolution, it was designed to make Bane look like equal parts dictatorial and revolutionary. The design was difficult as Hemming struggled to find a tailor in Los Angeles who could work with <b>shearling.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Shearling</b> is a {{skin from}} a {{recently}} sheared sheep or lamb {{that has been}} tanned and dressed with the wool left on. It has a suede surface {{on one side and}} a clipped fur surface on the other. Usually the suede side is worn outward. <b>Shearling</b> can be made from real sheepskin or from synthetic fibers. Real <b>shearling</b> breathes and is more flexible than synthetic <b>shearling.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>Shearling</b> coats {{are made}} from {{processed}} lambskin, sheepskin, or pelt. This [...] "shearing" [...] process creates a uniform depth of the wool fibers for a uniform feel and look. <b>Shearling</b> coats and garments {{are made from}} pelts by tanning them with the wool of uniform depth still on them. The result is a soft, natural fleece material that is lightweight and extremely comfortable. <b>Shearling</b> coats often contain insulated lining and are lightweight, warm, and stylish. Due to the high quality and uniqueness of <b>Shearling,</b> coats and garment are considered luxurious. The lighter the <b>Shearling</b> is, the higher quality it is considered to be.|$|E

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the A-2 and G-1 jackets, <b>shearling</b> jackets, originally lined with fur, are recognized for being the warmest flight jackets. Even when the fur was replaced with wool, this coat was warm enough to keep Lt. John A. Macready warm when he set a world record in April 1921, reaching an altitude of 40,000 feet in his open-cockpit airplane. Styles range from the B-3 [...] "bomber jacket", to the M-445, the U.S. Navy’s <b>shearling</b> jacket. Also popular in the military were, and still are, synthetic jackets. These jackets first gained esteem after General Hap Arnold rejected the A-2 jacket in 1942. Styles range from the cotton twill B-series to the standardized jacket of the U.S. Navy, the CWU-series. Both synthetic and <b>shearling</b> jackets are worn and collected by army buffs today, but neither has the historical status of the A-2 jacket or the G-1.|$|E
50|$|The {{manufacturing}} of {{fur clothing}} involves obtaining animal pelts where {{the hair is}} left on the animal's processed skin. In contrast, making leather involves removing the hair from the hide or pelt and using only the skin. The use of wool involves shearing the animal's fleece from the living animal, so that the wool can be regrown but sheepskin <b>shearling</b> is made by retaining the fleece to the leather and shearing it. <b>Shearling</b> is used for boots, jackets and coats and {{is probably the most}} common type of skin worn.|$|E

50|$|Taylor {{was born}} in Greenock, Scotland, in 1874, the fifteenth of {{seventeen}} children of an army major. Initially apprenticed in the Glasgow shipbuilding industry on the River Clyde, he trained as an artist at the Glasgow School of Art, where he met and married Jessie M. King in 1908. They moved to Salford, where he designed for George Wragge Ltd, producing many designs for stained glass. Between 1911 and 1914 the Taylors lived in Paris where they established an art school - the <b>Shearling</b> Atelier. The influence of modern French art and the Ballets Russes {{can be seen in}} Taylor’s art: his style broadened and he began to make more use of dramatic outlines.|$|E
50|$|Ethical vegans avoid {{clothing}} that incorporates silk, wool (including lambswool, <b>shearling,</b> cashmere, angora, mohair, {{and a number}} of other fine wools), fur, feathers, pearls, animal-derived dyes, or leather, snakeskin, or any other kind of skin or animal product. Most leather clothing is made from cows' and calves' skins, but the skin of sheep, goats, horses and pigs is also used. Less common skins include those from kangaroos, elephants, zebras, seals, crocodile and deer. Vegans regard the purchase of leather, particularly from cows, as financial support for the meat industry. Ethical vegans wear shoes, belts, jackets, handbags and other clothing items and accessories made of non-animal-derived materials, such as hemp, linen, cotton, canvas, polyester, synthetic leather (pleather), rubber, or vinyl. Ethical silk alternatives include bamboo and viscose. Leather alternatives can come from materials such as cork, piña (from pineapples), and mushroom leather.|$|E
50|$|By {{the time}} World War II started in earnest, {{electrically}} heated suits were introduced by Lion Apparel {{in conjunction with}} General Electric for patrol and bomber crews who routinely operated at high altitudes above 30,000 feet, where air temperatures could get so cold that flesh could freeze instantly to any metal it touched. As enclosed and pressurized cabins came into operation, the necessity of bulky leather and <b>shearling</b> jackets and pants began to fade. For example, pilots, navigators, and bombardiers of a B-17 operating in Europe in 1944 comfortably wore their officer's uniforms under an A-2 flight jacket, due to the enclosed and heated cabin; but the waist gunners needed electrically heated suits, as they fired their guns through open window gunports. When the B-29 Superfortress {{was introduced in the}} fight against Japan, along with remote-controlled coordinated gun turrets, the fully pressurized crew cabin made bulky flight gear obsolete.|$|E
50|$|Sheepskin coats, vests, {{and boots}} {{are common in}} the {{traditional}} dress of peoples throughout the Old World (wherever sheep are raised). They seem to be especially popular in the steppes of Eastern European and Northern Asia, {{and according to the}} French knight Robert de Clari, {{they were part of the}} national costume of the Cuman people who lived there circa 1200CE. In Ukraine a sheepskin coat is called a kozhukh and a vest a kozhushanka are an iconic part of the national costume, while in Russia the same coat was usually called tulup. In Spain such a coat is called a zamarra, in Tibet a chuba, in Kazakh a ton, in Romania a cojoc,. In the English-speaking world, one may speak of a <b>shearling</b> coat. During the 1970s in Britain the suedehead subculture adopted this item as an identifying fashion, and it also had some popularity with hippies in North America. Sheepskin-lined Ugg boots became popular worldwide in the late 1990s.|$|E
5000|$|In early 1943 the AAF did not renew its {{contracts}} for leather flight garments and began production of flight jackets and flying trousers made of cotton twill and nylon blends with alpaca pile linings. The AAF standardized the sage green or light olive drab B-10 flight jacket on 22 July 1943, accompanied by matching A-9 flying trousers with built-in suspenders, {{and the combination}} became widespread in the Eighth Air Force by early 1944. The heavier B-15 jacket followed {{at the end of}} the year, with the A-11 trousers issued in the last months of the war. Most jackets featured a Mouton fur or <b>shearling</b> collar, but a popular variation known as the [...] "tanker jacket" [...] had a wool knit collar that was less confining. These new jackets were lighter in weight than their leather predecessors while just as warm. Hooded variants designated B-9 and B-11 also appeared in early 1944 but because they were bulky and their fur-lined hoods impractical in combat, these were worn primarily by noncombat personnel or during ground duties.|$|E

5000|$|Flight {{clothing}} varied widely by {{theater of}} operation {{and type of}} mission. Innovative aviation flight suits, boots, leather helmets, goggles, and gloves were issued as early as 1928 to the Air Corps, {{and at least one}} style, the Type A-3 flight suit, continued in service until 1944. However, A-2 flight jackets, made standard issue on 9 May 1931, became one of the best known symbols of the AAF. Made of seal brown horsehide leather (later supplemented by goatskin) with a beige spun silk lining (cotton after 1939), the jackets featured an officer's stand-up collar, shoulder straps, knit waistbands and cuffs, a zipper closing, and unit insignia. Heavy, sheepskin-lined B-3 and B-6 flight jackets, A-3 winter flying trousers, and B-2 [...] "gunner's" [...] caps, all in seal brown <b>shearling,</b> proved insufficient for the extreme cold temperatures of high altitude missions in unpressurized aircraft, and were supplemented by a variety of one-piece electrically heated flying suits manufactured by General Electric. In addition to men's flight clothing, flight nurses wore specially manufactured women's lightweight and intermediate weight flight jackets and pants. Flight clothing such as the A-2 jacket was not authorized to be worn off the camp or post unless required for flight duty. The same sage green fatigue uniforms of herringbone cotton twill, and wind-resistant poplin field jackets used by Army ground troops, were also worn by AAF troops depending on duty assignment.|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to test the effects of {{maternal}} nutrition (0. 5 versus 1. 0 x maintenance) during early foetal life and peri-ovulatory nutrition on the reproductive performance and associated parameters of Scottish hillbreeds (North Country Cheviot and Scottish Blackface) crossed with Texel sires carrying or not carrying the X-linked Inverdale (FecX I) gene. Undernutrition of the dam resulted in reduced birthweights of single male lambs, reduced plasma progesterone concentrations of ewe lambs and a tendency for reduced ovulation rates in ewe lambs and shearlings (non-carriers) but litter size was not affected. Heterozygous carriers of the Inverdale gene showed a mean increase in ovulation rate of approximately 0. 35 as ewe lambs, and approximately 0. 65 the following year, the latter resulting in a mean litter size increase of approximately 0. 6. Plasma progesterone concentrations were lower for FecX I gene-carriers as ewe lambs and also as adults in a flock that had been flushed prior to mating, suggesting that the increased feed intake {{could have had a}} suppressing effect on the concentrations of this hormone. It is postulated that this could have resulted in the large number of peri-natal losses associated with gene-carrier ewes in the same flock, since neonatal vigour of offspring of gene-carriers was not affected in the SAC experimental flock that had not been flushed pre-mating. Presence of the FecX I gene is associated with a reduction in birthweight of approximately 0. 5 kg which could be due to the reduced placental efficiency of gene-carrier dams. At puberty and as shearlings gene-carriers remained lighter than their non-carrier counterparts. Throughout the <b>shearling</b> breeding season the increase in ovulation rate associated with this prolificacy gene remained constant.
