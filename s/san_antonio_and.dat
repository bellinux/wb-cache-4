5|$|On August 8, 1847, Buckner was {{appointed}} quartermaster of the 6th Infantry. Shortly thereafter, {{he participated in}} battles at <b>San</b> <b>Antonio</b> <b>and</b> Churubusco, being slightly wounded in the latter battle. He {{was appointed}} a brevet first lieutenant for gallantry at Churubusco and Contreras, but declined the honor in part because reports of his participation at Contreras were in error—he had been fighting in San Antonio at the time. Later, he was offered and accepted the same rank solely based on his conduct at Churubusco.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Haynes and Leary {{published}} the magazine Strange V.D., which featured photos of abnormal medical ailments, coupled with fictitious, humorous {{explanations for the}} diseases. After being caught {{with one of these}} pictures at work, Haynes left the accounting firm and moved to Southern California. Leary, at the time one semester shy of his degree, dropped out of college and followed Haynes. After a brief period spent selling homemade clothes and linens emblazoned with Lee Harvey Oswald's image, the pair returned to <b>San</b> <b>Antonio,</b> <b>and</b> launched the band that would eventually become Butthole Surfers.|$|E

5|$|Krueger {{retired to}} San Antonio, Texas, where, in February 1946, {{he bought a}} house for the first time. Because of a large income tax bill {{left over from the}} war, he was unable to buy it {{outright}} and so some of his friends established the Krueger Fund Committee, which paid for much of the house. In retirement, Krueger was involved in a number of charity and community organizations, including the United Service Organization, the Red Cross, and the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, and he served as director of civil defense for <b>San</b> <b>Antonio</b> <b>and</b> Bexar County.|$|E
5|$|The nomadic Karankawa Indians {{used the}} bay for hunting {{before the arrival}} of Europeans, but no major human {{settlements}} were ever established. The unincorporated community of Lamar on Live Oak Peninsula is the only substantial community that borders the bay. The cities of Rockport and Fulton on the main Aransas Bay are located only a few miles away, and the bay is usually considered a part of the collective Rockport-Fulton area. The bay is roughly 150 miles southeast of <b>San</b> <b>Antonio</b> <b>and</b> about 40 miles northeast of Corpus Christi.|$|E

He received every American combat award for valor available at the time of his service, including the Medal of Honor. He also received recognitions from France and Belgium. With his 1945 military discharge at the end of the war, Murphy became an advocate of treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder in veterans. The Audie L. Murphy Memorial VA Hospital in <b>San</b> <b>Antonio</b> <b>and</b> the Sergeant Audie Murphy Clubs (SAMC) on military bases honor his contributions. He joined the Texas National Guard in 1950, transferring to reserve status in 1956 and remaining in the Guard until 1969. He also had a civilian career as a film actor and songwriter.

Shiner, the town in which Youngs was born, hosted a baseball tournament in his honor at Clipper Field from 2001 through 2003.|$|E
5|$|In 1791 and 1792, Fray José Francisco Garza befriended {{some of the}} Karankawa {{and other}} native peoples. Their {{friendship}} allowed Garza to explore much of the coastal areas that had been too dangerous to visit. The Indians requested that Garza build a mission at the junction of the <b>San</b> <b>Antonio</b> <b>and</b> Guadalupe Rivers, and in February 1793 Mission Nuestra Señora del Refugio opened near Mission Lake {{at the head of}} San Antonio Bay. Over 230Indians lived at the mission initially, but within two years they were forced to move to a less flood-prone site, which became known as Refugio. By {{the end of the eighteenth}} century, only a small number of the hunting and gathering tribes within Texas had not been Christianized. In 1793, mission San Antonio de Valero was secularized, and the following year the four remaining missions at San Antonio were partially secularized.|$|E
5|$|The Coast Starlight began {{operating}} with Superliners in January 1981. The Sunset Limited, a long-distance train {{running along the}} southern border of the United States between Los Angeles and New Orleans, gained them in February, resulting in a commendation from the Texas State Legislature. The Pioneer gained Superliner coaches on April 26. The Eagle, an overnight train between <b>San</b> <b>Antonio</b> <b>and</b> Chicago, began carrying Superliners in October on those days it connected with the Sunset Limited in San Antonio. Superliner assignments became permanent in the 1990s. Amtrak estimated that reequipping a train with Superliners boosted ridership on it by 25%. The last car of the order, a sleeper delivered in July 1981, was also the last car ever built by Pullman, and was {{named in honor of}} the company's founder, George Mortimer Pullman.|$|E

5|$|In the Gulf of Mexico, Shell Oil {{evacuated}} about 40{{workers from}} drilling operations. BP and Chevron also evacuated workers from platforms {{in the western}} and central Gulf, though neither predicted substantial effects on production. A few oil refineries on land were closed, such as one operated by Marathon Oil in Texas City, Texas. Governor of Texas Rick Perry issued a disaster declaration for 17Texas counties that were threatened by Tropical Storm Edouard. Perry activated up to 1,200National Guard troops, a 70member rescue team, six helicopters, and an incident management team that brings food and water to affected areas. Under the order, about 200buses became available in <b>San</b> <b>Antonio</b> <b>and</b> Houston to help in evacuations. Dow Chemical shut down their plants in Clear Lake and La Porte. The United States Coast Guard also ceased cargo operations to the Galveston-Houston area by late on August4. Governor of Louisiana Bobby Jindal declared a statewide emergency. In Cameron Parish, Louisiana the Office of Emergency Preparedness ordered a mandatory evacuation, where Sheriff's deputies also erected roadblocks.|$|E
5|$|SH151 {{begins at}} Loop1604, the outer loop around San Antonio, {{on the west}} side of <b>San</b> <b>Antonio</b> <b>and</b> from there follows a southeastern path through the western part of the city. The highway {{provides}} access to the SeaWorld San Antonio theme park as well as industry along its corridor to include Chase, Hyatt Hill Country Resort, World Savings, Philips semiconductor, the National Security Agency campus, QVC, American Funds, Maxim Integrated Products, and the Northwest Vista College, as well as the nearby Southwest Research Institute. Microsoft has also selected the corridor for a $550 million data center. The highway continues to the southeast to a junction with Interstate 410 (I-410), the inner loop around San Antonio. There is not a direct connect interchange at the junction of I-410. It is necessary to travel on both highways' frontage roads in order to change highways. The highway continues to the southeast through mainly undeveloped land until it merges with US90. According to the San Antonio Master Thoroughfare Plan, there are plans to extend SH 151 westward from Loop1604 to SH211. The plan also shows the construction of an interchange at Loop 1604.|$|E
5|$|The {{threat of}} Apache raids {{led to a}} {{constant}} state of unease in <b>San</b> <b>Antonio,</b> <b>and</b> some families left the area, while others refused to leave the safety of the town to tend their livestock. The problems culminated with a late-night raid on San Antonio by 350Apache on June 30, 1745, retaliation for a Spanish military campaign several months before. The attackers were repelled with the assistance of 100Indians from Mission Valero. The Apache also preyed on other tribes, including the Deadose and Tonkawa. In the 1740s, these weaker tribes requested missions along the San Gabriel River in the hopes that the Spanish could protect them from attack. Mission San Francisco Xavier was established at the confluence of the San Gabriel River and Bushy Creek in January 1746 to serve the Deadose, Mayeye, and Coco Indians. In 1748 alone, the Apaches raided the mission four times, killing threesoldiers and four of the Indian residents. Many of the resident Indians fled the mission due to the threat of attacks. This did not deter the missionaries, who founded two more missions, San Ildefonso and Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria, in the area the following year. Within six months, all of the potential converts at San Ildefonso had left. By 1755, the missions were transferred to a new location on the San Marcos River.|$|E
