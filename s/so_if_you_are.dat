500|$|A {{study of}} married couples in China noted that men tended to marry down the {{socio-economic}} ladder. [...] "There is an opinion that A-quality guys will find B-quality women, B-quality guys will find C-quality women, and C-quality men will find D-quality women," [...] says Huang Yuanyuan. [...] "The people left are A-quality women and D-quality men. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a leftover woman, you are A-quality." [...] A University of North Carolina demographer who studies China's gender imbalance, Yong Cai, further notes that [...] "men {{at the bottom}} of society get left out of the marriage market, and that same pattern is coming to emerge for women at the top of society".|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, we {{have settled}} that," [...] said Ethel, [...] "we mean {{to make the}} donkey a sumpter-mule, <b>so,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> tired, you may ride home on her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But you'll have to wait," [...] said Lady Aylmer, turning {{upon her}} {{companion}} almost fiercely. [...] "That is, you certainly {{will have to}} do <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> to depend upon Frederic's income alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Something {{very like}} it. But, however, I {{have no doubt}} <b>you</b> <b>were</b> true enough. But, Bell, why should it <b>be</b> <b>so?</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> in love with any one else I could {{understand}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It would <b>be</b> <b>so,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> to {{make him}} a beetle and wedge, because he was a bad boy; but I {{proposed}} that you should make it for another reason, that is, to please him." ...|$|R
60|$|ANABEL. Good night, Mr. Barlow. I <b>am</b> <b>so</b> sorry <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> over-tired.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know it, Geoffrey. I {{wanted to}} see your {{happiness}} before I go away again, and should like {{to stay with you}} a day or <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> sure that--that she would like it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Barry {{will turn}} up all in proper time," [...] said her father. [...] "I have got {{nothing to say about}} Mr. Barry just at present, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> love-lorn you had better go to bed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't mind {{talking of}} her," [...] said Breckon. [...] "Perhaps it will even be well to do <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> in earnest. Though {{it strikes me}} that you have rather renounced the right to criticise me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would say}} <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> to see Miss Chancellor when Verena rises to eloquence. It's {{as if the}} chords were strung across her own heart; she seems to vibrate, to echo with every word. It's a very close and very {{beautiful}} tie, and we think everything of it here. They will work together for a great good!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's odd, my dear," [...] {{returned}} the captain, [...] "because my object in coming here <b>is</b> to take <b>you</b> {{to a certain}} place in Yarmouth, and, although I {{have not had the}} opportunity of letting you slip through my fingers, I've no doubt you'd do <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> tempted away by a bait that begins with a D." ...|$|R
5000|$|The court {{thinks that}} a man with normal sexual {{instincts}} is incapable of committing the crime, {{and that it is}} only a person of abnormal sexual sense that is capable of committing it. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> satisfied that one was possessed of this unnatural or abnormal sexual sense, you might infer that he had a motive, a reason or a force, impelling him to do such an act.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are so fastidious, {{nothing ever}} suits you, dear. I didn't expect {{to like this}} old friend of yours. But I frankly confess I do immensely; <b>so,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> tired of him, I'll take him off your hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't help it," [...] said Olive. [...] "I am {{not going}} to leave Miss Raleigh, and I am sure she does not want to leave me, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> obliged to speak you must speak before her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then do <b>so.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{particularly}} {{anxious to}} dine with Mr. Kennedy, {{you can easily}} do so at your club." [...] In the tone of her voice, and the words she used, she hardly attempted to conceal her dislike of her husband.|$|E
6000|$|And <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> to stop off at Rosa to-morrow, or {{any other}} day, you'd see a fine new yellow house with Mrs. Pratt, that was Mrs. Sampson, embellishing and adorning it. And <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> to step inside you'd see on the marble-top centre table in the parlour [...] "Herkimer's Handbook of Indispensable Information," [...] all rebound in red morocco, and ready to be {{consulted}} on any subject pertaining to human happiness and wisdom.|$|R
6000|$|... "You wouldn't {{have thought}} <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> hadn't <b>been</b> a great flirt yourself," [...] she answered, audaciously. [...] "Perhaps I {{have been engaged}} before!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have no {{quarrel with}} Tars Tarkas; {{together}} we rule supreme the greatest of the lesser communities among the green men; we {{do not wish to}} fight between ourselves; and <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> dead, John Carter, I should be glad. Under two conditions only, however, may <b>you</b> <b>be</b> killed by us without orders from Tal Hajus; in personal combat in self-defense, should you attack one of us, or <b>were</b> <b>you</b> apprehended in an attempt to escape.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{more than}} likely you'll {{be sent to the}} west," [...] he said. [...] "I think the gangs in the south have all the helpers they need. I am going west myself; <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> sent that way perhaps we'll see more of each other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes you will, dear," [...] Dorothy declared. [...] "The piglet is gone, and you {{ran out of}} {{the room}} when Jellia opened the door. <b>So,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> innocent, Eureka, you must tell the Princess how you came to be in her room, and what has become of the piglet." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{porridge}} {{is quite}} ready for you, Ralph; <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> late {{it will be}} your own fault not mine. The eggs will be in before you have eaten it. However, I won't open the letter until you have gone, because you will only waste time by asking questions about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked at}} me {{directly}} in the face. [...] "I shall call it 'David's air,'" [...] said she; [...] "though if it's the least like what your namesake of Israel played to Saul I would never wonder that the king got little good by it, for it's but melancholy music. Your other name I do not like; <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>was</b> ever wishing to hear your tune again <b>you</b> <b>are</b> to ask for it by mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then do <b>so,</b> Jeffrey, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> scared, and I {{will go on}} alone, who, {{being on}} an honest business, fear not Satan or an abbot, either." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You mean {{to stick}} it out? Don't be foolish, sonny. The boys here are mad enough at you already. What's the use of getting {{yourself}} in bad for nothing? We've got you in a pocket. I know all about that gun of yours, young fellow. I had a suspicion what had happened, and I've been {{into the house and}} found the shells you forgot to take with <b>you.</b> <b>So,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> thinking of making a bluff in that direction forget it!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{footstool}} of silk is {{more comfortable}} {{to sit on}} than a state chair fashioned of blood-stained swords. Hearken you, Kaku! I am afraid. You {{say that you are}} the greatest of seers, and can read the future. Well, I desire to know the future, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not a charlatan, show it to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I would {{cling to}} you sooner than to him. I {{have told him}} so, and he has {{threatened}} to turn me penniless from his house. Still I shall cling to you, because you are my love. I shall do <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> equally true to me. That is my idea of love. There can be no divided allegiance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{you are the}} lad {{that works}} for my {{neighbour}} Anderson?" [...] Captain Dave said, as he surveyed him closely. [...] "I like your looks, lad, but I doubt whether we shall get on together. I am an old sailor, you know, and I am quick of speech and don't stop to choose my words, <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> quick to take offence it would be of no use your coming to me." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{nearly all}} settings, a shared set of darts is used, rather than every {{competitor}} having their own darts. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{to retrieve the}} darts you just threw, all you would then do is immediately hand them to the next player. With that in mind, it is simply quicker for the incoming shooter to remove the darts from the board, rather than the awkward process of the preceding shooter removing them, then (carefully) passing a handful of three sharpened steel darts to the next player.|$|R
5000|$|The early {{problems}} {{led to a}} raft of aerodynamic {{changes in}} the first half of the season, the first coming for the ill-fated San Marino GP at Imola. The front wing was a significant area of development.“The problem is that the front wing is too sensitive to the rideheight,” said Patrick Head in 1994. “If <b>you</b> <b>were</b> in a corner and went over a bump, the car could pick up a lot more front downforce than rear. <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> balanced at that point, with the car neutral, you’d lose the rear very quickly.” ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{alternate}} U.S. {{version of}} Lammy's Stage 6, however, drew mixed praise and criticism. IGN called it [...] "a far off island [...] has that Japan-idol-talk influence... <b>So</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> {{expecting to see}} one of the levels being in hell, well, it's not in there." [...] Similarly, GameSpot's Gerstmann made a later update on his March 26, 1999, review by commenting on the U.S. alterations to Stage 6, exclaiming, [...] "It doesn't really affect the game too much, since much of the game doesn't {{make a lot of sense}} to begin with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just so. Only, whereas {{you simply}} thought me a snob, I had in reality a {{different}} and very definite purpose. We come now, however, to your present obligation to me. I can, if I choose, tear up your forged transfer, submit {{to the loss of}} my money, and leave you secure. I shall do <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> able to induce your sister to hand over to me those few lines of writing--to which, believe me, she has no earthly right--and to accept me as a prospective suitor." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! Mr. Macdermot, {{how do you}} do--how d'ye do? I'm glad to see you--very glad to see you--looking so well too. Why, what a time it is since I last had the pleasure--but then I'm so tied by the leg--so much business, Mr. Macdermot; indeed, though I was {{determined}} to drop in this morning as a friend, still even now I've just a word to say on business. You see I must join business and pleasure; <b>so</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not very much engaged, and could spare a minute or two, why I have a little proposal to make to you--acting for Mr. Flannelly you know--which I think you'll not be sorry to hear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{mind the}} loss of the brig, Captain. It was no fault of yours that she came to grief. Other ship-owners may do as they please. I shall take the liberty of doing as I please. <b>So,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> ready, the ship is ready. I have seen Captain Stuart, and I find that he is down with typhoid fever, poor fellow, and won't be fit for duty again for many weeks. The Walrus must sail not later than a week or ten days hence. She can't sail without a captain, and I know of no better man than yourself; so, if you agree to take command, there she is, if not I'll find another man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not {{nearly so}} much <b>so</b> as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> not all here,' said her aunt cheerfully. 'When you bemoaned your sisters {{last year we}} did not think the same thing was coming on me.' ...|$|R
60|$|THE ENVOY. Not so poor neither, Poppa. Nor <b>so</b> weak, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> {{going to}} take in all the Powers. If it comes to killing, two can play at that game, longlived or shortlived.|$|R
6000|$|... "You have my word {{of honor}} that I will {{not so much}} as think of them after leaving this hovel. Whatsoever I may have heard or seen here is locked in my breast forever, <b>if</b> <b>so</b> <b>be</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> minded to treat with me." ...|$|R
