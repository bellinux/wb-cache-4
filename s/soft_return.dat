6000|$|The social {{atmosphere}} was now sultry, and overcast, and Mr. Pope's decision {{to spend the}} interval before Daffy returned in seeing whether he couldn't do something to the net, which was certainly very unsatisfactory, did not improve matters. Then, unhappily, Marjorie, who had got rather keen upon tennis at the Carmels', claimed her father's first two services as faults, contrary to the etiquette of the family. It happened that Mr. Pope had a really very good, hard, difficult, smart-looking serve, whose only defect was that it always went either too far or else into the net, and so a feeling had been fostered and established by his wife that, on the whole, it was advisable to regard the former variety as a legitimate extension of a father's authority. Naturally, therefore, Mr. Pope was nettled at Marjorie's ruling, and his irritation increased when his next two services to Daffy perished in the net. ("Damn that net! Puts one's eye out.") Then Marjorie gave him an unexpected <b>soft</b> <b>return</b> which he somehow muffed, and then Daffy just dropped a return {{over the top of}} the net. (Love-game.) It was then Marjorie's turn to serve, which she did with a new twist acquired from the eldest Carmel boy that struck Mr. Pope as un-English. [...] "Go on," [...] he said concisely.

50|$|In word {{processing}} and desktop publishing, a hard return or paragraph break indicates a new paragraph, to {{be distinguished from}} the <b>soft</b> <b>return</b> {{at the end of}} a line internal to a paragraph.This distinction allows word wrap to automatically re-flow text as it is edited, without losing paragraph breaks. The software may apply vertical whitespace or indenting at paragraph breaks, depending on the selected style.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{contemporary}} graphical word processors Microsoft Word and OpenOffice.org, users {{are expected to}} type a carriage return (...) between each paragraph. Formatting settings, such as first-line indentation or spacing between paragraphs, take effect where the carriage return marks the break. A non-paragraph line break, which is a <b>soft</b> <b>return,</b> is inserted using [...] or via the menus, and is provided for cases when the text should start on a new line {{but none of the}} other side effects of starting a new paragraph are desired.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>soft</b> <b>return</b> or soft wrap is {{the break}} {{resulting}} from line wrap or word wrap (whether automatic or manual), whereas a hard return or hard wrap is an intentional break, {{creating a new}} paragraph. With a hard return, paragraph-break formatting can (and should) be applied (either indenting or vertical whitespace). Soft wrapping allows line lengths to adjust automatically with adjustments to {{the width of the}} user's window or margin settings, and is a standard feature of all modern text editors, word processors, and email clients. Manual soft breaks are unnecessary when word wrap is done automatically, so hitting the [...] "Enter" [...] key usually produces a hard return.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} Memory with Memory Genetic Programming (MwM-GP), {{where we}} use soft assignments and <b>soft</b> <b>return</b> operations. Instead {{of having the}} new value completely overwrite the old value of registers or memory, soft assignments combine such values. Similarly, in <b>soft</b> <b>return</b> operations {{the value of a}} function node is a blend between the result of a calculation and previously returned results. In extensive empirical tests, MwM-GP almost always does as well as traditional GP, while significantly outperforming it in several cases. MwM-GP also tends to be far more consistent than traditional GP. The data suggest that MwM-GP works by successively refining an approximate solution to the target problem and that it is much less likely to have truly ineffective code. MwM-GP can continue to improve over time, but it is less likely to get the sort of exact solution that one might find with traditional GP. Copyright © 2009 Riccardo Poli et al.

25|$|Xenoblade Chronicles X was {{developed}} by Japanese development company Monolith Soft, with Tetsuya Takahashi forming the original concept and serving as the game's executive director. Takahashi had previously worked in the 1990s on Xenogears, then on the Xenosaga trilogy after founding Monolith Soft in 1999. Xenosaga {{was intended to be}} a six-part series, but low commercial performances forced the planned Xenosaga series to be halved. The Xeno series regained popularity and found success with the release of Xenoblade Chronicles for the Wii. Following the completion of Xenoblade Chronicles in 2011, Takahashi approached Nintendo producer Hitoshi Yamagami and asked if he could develop a new science fiction-themed role-playing game built upon the systems of Xenoblade Chronicles. Yamagami and Nintendo were willing, and talks turned towards what Takahashi and Monolith Soft could do on Nintendo's Wii U console.

25|$|The {{direction}} of magnetization of the wedges in (A) can be calculated using {{a set of rules}} given by Abele and allows for great freedom {{in the shape of the}} cavity. Another class of design is the magnetic mangle (B), proposed by Coey and Cugat, in which uniformly magnetized rods are arranged such that their magnetization matches that of a Halbach cylinder, as shown for a 6-rod design. This design greatly increases access to the region of uniform field, at the expense of the volume of uniform field being smaller than in the cylindrical designs (although this area can be made larger by increasing the number of component rods). Rotating the rods relative to each other results in many possibilities including a dynamically variable field and various dipolar configurations. It can be seen that the designs shown in (A) and (B) are closely related to the k=2 Halbach cylinder. Other very simple designs for a uniform field include separated magnets with <b>soft</b> iron <b>return</b> paths, as shown in figure (C).|$|R

This motif, played on clarinet, bassoon, cornet and cellos over tremolo strings, concludes the prelude with an abrupt crescendo. When the curtain rises a light and sunny atmosphere is soon established, and pervades the opening scenes. The mock solemnities of {{the changing of the}} guard, and the flirtatious exchanges between the townsfolk and the factory girls, precede a mood change when a brief phrase from the fate motif announces Carmen's entrance.
