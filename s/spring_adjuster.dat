50|$|The {{pressure}} <b>spring</b> can be <b>adjusted</b> {{to increase}} or decrease pressure based on temperature needs. The pressure created by the spring acts on {{the opening of the}} valve.

5000|$|The [...] "cat's whisker", a springy {{piece of}} thin metal wire, formed the metal {{side of the}} junction.

Cat's whiskers in simple detectors were straight or curved, but most professional cat's whiskers had a coiled section in the middle that served as a spring. [...] The crystal required just the right gentle pressure by the wire; too much pressure caused the device to conduct in both directions.

50|$|The Gyromax balance has six {{to eight}} small {{turnable}} weights that fit on pins located in recesses {{around the top of}} the balance wheel rim. Each of the weights, called collets, has a cutout making it heavier on one side. When the collet's cutout points to the outside of the balance wheel, the heavier side is toward the center which decreases the wheel's moment of inertia, increasing its speed. When the collet's cutout points toward the center, the weight moves outward and the balance wheel turns more slowly. A watchmaker can turn an individual collet to adjust the wheel's balance, referred to as 'poise', or pairs of opposing collets to adjust the wheel's rotation speed. The Gyromax is a 'free sprung' balance, meaning there is no regulator on the wheel's balance <b>spring</b> for <b>adjusting</b> the watch's rate, so the collets are used for adjusting both poise and rate.|$|R

50|$|This type of mill {{consists}} of two types of rings separated {{by a series of}} large balls, like a thrust bearing. The lower ring rotates, while the upper ring presses down on the balls via a set of <b>spring</b> and <b>adjuster</b> assemblies, or pressurised rams. The material to be pulverized is introduced into the center or side of the pulverizer (depending on the design). As the lower ring rotates, the balls to orbit between the upper and lower rings, and balls roll over the bed of coal on the lower ring. The pulverized material is carried out of the mill by the flow of air moving through it. The size of the pulverized particles released from the grinding section of the mill is determined by a classifier separator. If the coal is fine enough to be picked up by the air, it is carried through the classifier. Coarser particles return to be further pulverized.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{quantify}} and compare the 3 -dimensional intersegmental motion responses produced by 3 commonly used chiropractic adjusting instruments. METHODS: Six adolescent Merino sheep were examined at the Institute for Medical and Veterinary Science, Adelaide, Australia. In all animals, triaxial accelerometers were attached to intraosseous pins rigidly fixed to the L 1 and L 2 spinous processes under fluoroscopic guidance. Three handheld mechanical force chiropractic adjusting instruments (Chiropractic Adjusting Tool [CAT], Activator Adjusting Instrument IV [Activator IV], and the Impulse Adjusting Instrument [Impulse]) were used to randomly apply posteroanterior (PA) spinal manipulative thrusts to the spinous process of T 12. Three force settings (low, medium, and high) and a fourth setting (Activator IV only) were applied in a randomized repeated measures design. Acceleration responses in adjacent segments (L 1 and L 2) were recorded at 5 kHz. The multiaxial intersegmental (L 1 -L 2) acceleration and displacement response at each force setting was computed and compared among the 3 devices using a repeated measures analysis of variance (alpha =. 05). RESULTS: For all devices, intersegmental motion responses were greatest for axial, followed by PA and medial-lateral (ML) measurement axes for the data examined. Displacements ranged from 0. 11 mm (ML axis, Activator IV low setting) to 1. 76 mm (PA axis, Impulse high setting). Compared with the mechanical (<b>spring)</b> <b>adjusting</b> instruments (CAT, Activator IV), the electromechanical Impulse produced the most linear increase in both force and intersegmental motion response and resulted in the greatest acceleration and displacement responses (high setting). Significantly larger magnitude intersegmental motion responses were observed for Activator IV vs CAT at the medium and high settings (P <. 05). Significantly larger-magnitude PA intersegmental acceleration and displacement responses were consistently observed for Impulse compared with Activator IV and CAT for the high force setting (P <. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Larger-magnitude, 3 D intersegmental displacement and acceleration responses were observed for spinal manipulative thrusts delivered with Impulse at most force settings and always at the high force setting. Our results indicate that the force-time characteristics of impulsive-type adjusting instruments significantly affects spinal motion and suggests that instruments can and should be tuned to provide optimal force delivery...|$|R

The aim of this randomized, clinical trial was to evaluate the effect of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on the rate of orthodontic tooth movement (OTM) and pain control. Materials and Methods: This single-blind study included twenty participants requiring extraction of all first premolars. Randomly selected split-mouth design was used. One side was irradiated with 810 nm diode laser (dose of 5. 0 J/cm 2) at 10 points for 10 s. Irradiation was performed just after loading canine retraction forces and on days 3 rd and 7 th.

40|$|Abstract: A {{preliminary}} {{feasibility study}} is made of the efficiency of tuned vibration absorbers for reducing response of floating bodies, such as offshore platforms, barges, and so on, to random ocean waves. The absorbers are submerged spring-loaded flaps, with stiffnesses of the <b>springs</b> being <b>adjusted</b> for tuning to any specific (rigid-body) mode of the platform (heaving, pitching, etc.), whereas actual design of the flaps should provide the desired amount of drag-induced damping. Mean square response analysis {{of the system is}} made for the case of a narrow-band random excitation due to ocean waves by using method of moments in conjunction with statistical linearization (with Gaussian closure) for quadratic damping term. Extensive parametric study is made of the efficiency of vibration control through the use of absorbers, as represented by the root-mean-square (RMS) response reduction factor. In particular, the efficiency increases with the absorber/platform mass ratio, and it may be of some practical importance even at values of this ratio as small as 1 %. The importance of the excitation bandwidth is demonstrated. It is shown that, whereas optimal damping of the absorber depends on the level of wave excitation, the RMS response reduction factor is fairly constant within a rather broad range of (nonlinear) damping, so that adjusting absorber damping for storm level may not be necessary.
