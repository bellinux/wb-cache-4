40|$|Abstract Background During {{clinical}} practice, {{we noticed}} that some patients with both ulcerative colitis (UC) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) showed amelioration of UC after treatment of CRS. This {{study was designed to}} identify a possible association between CRS and UC. Methods Thirty-two patients with both CRS and UC received treatment with functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) for CRS. Clinical symptom scores for CRS and UC, as well as serum levels of anti-Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) were evaluated at week 0 and week 12. <b>Sinus</b> <b>wash</b> fluid SEB content was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The surgically removed tissues were cultured to identify growth of Staphylococcus. aureus (S. aureus). Immunohistochemistry was employed to identify anti-SEB positive cells in the colonic mucosa. Colonic biopsies were obtained and incubated with SEB. Mast cell activation in the colonic mucosa in response to incubation with SEB was observed with electron microscopy and immunoassay. Results The clinical symptom scores of CRS and UC severe scores (UCSS) were significantly reduced in the UC-CRS patients after FESS. The number of cultured S. aureus colonies from the surgically removed sinus mucosa significantly correlated with the decrease in UCSS. High levels of SEB were detected in the <b>sinus</b> <b>wash</b> fluids of the patients with UC-CRS. Histamine and tryptase release was significantly higher in the culture supernate in the patients with UC-CRS than the patients with UC-only and normal controls. Anti-SEB positive cells were located in the colonic mucosa. Conclusion The pathogenesis of UC in some patients may be associated with their pre-existing CRS by a mechanism of swallowing sinusitis-derived SEB. We speculate that SEB initiates inappropriate immune reactions and inflammation in the colonic mucosa that further progresses to UC. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background : Oroantral {{communication}} (OAC) {{is one of}} {{the possible}} complications after extraction of the upper teeth. If not identified and treated properly, a large OAC may develop into oroantral fistula (OAF) which means that there is a permanent epithelium-lined communication between antrum and oral cavity. Such fistulas may cause ingress of microorganism from oral cavity into the antrum leading to maxillary sinusitis. Oroantral fistula usually persists if the infection in the maxillary antrum is not eliminated. Therefore, treatment of oroantral fistula should include management of maxillary sinusitis in which surgical closure of oroantral fistula should be done only when the sinusitis has been cured. Purpose : This case report emphasizes on the importance of proper management of maxillary sinusitis in the healing of oroantral fistula. Case : A case of an oroantral fistula following removal of upper left third molar is presented. As the maxillary sinusitis was not identified pre-operatively, two surgical procedures to close the fistula had ended up in dehiscence. Case management : The diagnosis of maxillary sinusitis was finally made and the sinusitis subsequently treated with combination of trans-alveolar <b>sinus</b> <b>wash</b> out, insertion of an acrylic splint, and two series of nasal and sinus physiotherapy procedures. The size of the defect decreased gradually during the treatment of the sinusitis and finally closed up without any further surgical intervention. Conclusion : This case report points out {{that it is important to}} detect intraoperatively an antral perforation after any surgery of the maxillary teeth and to close any oroantral communication as early as possible and that it is important to treat properly any pre-existing maxillary sinusitis before any surgical method is done to close the fistula. </span...|$|E
40|$|The {{burden of}} drug {{resistance}} emerges {{in the wake}} of chronic and repeated antibiotic use. This underpins the importance of discovering alternatives to current antibiotic regimens. In chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), topical therapy such as nasal douches and steroid sprays is the mainstay of treatment. However, bacterial sinusitis such as those with Staphylococcus aureus biofilm infection point to more recalcitrant CRS subtypes, focusing research efforts into topical antimicrobial therapies. In the sinuses, both local mucosal and systemic effects must be considered in designing any new topical medication. Nitric oxide (NO), an endogenous antimicrobial agent, is found at extremely low levels in CRS sinuses and high levels in healthy sinuses. As a novel treatment modality, we have designed a liposomal formulation of an NO donor (LFNO) using isosorbide mononitrate, as a topical <b>sinus</b> <b>wash</b> in a sheep model of S. aureus biofilm rhinosinusitis. Heart rate (HR), blood pressure, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and histologic and ciliary analyses were assessed in the safety component. Efficacy was assessed by quantifying biofilm biomass post-treatment. LFNO-treated sheep had lesser inflammation (P = 0. 02), and comparable ciliary preservation (P = 0. 86) than the control group. A transient increase in HR and decrease in MAP were observed in the LFNO group (P < 0. 05), but this was not accompanied by observable side effects. LFNO sheep had significantly lower biofilm biomass vs controls (P = 0. 044). Our findings demonstrate the localized and systemic safety of LFNO in an animal model despite using high NO concentrations, thus warranting further investigation for its possible therapeutic role in CRS.

40|$|Chronic {{sinusitis}} is a {{major cause}} of morbidity today. Regional variations in the incidence of this disease have been reported. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the incidence of fungal infection as the causative agent of chronic sinusitis among Iranian patients. A cross sectional hospital based study was designed; the patients underwent paranasal <b>sinus</b> <b>washing</b> and maxillary <b>sinus</b> biopsy. All specimens were studied by light microscopy. Fungal culturing was employed to confirm diagnosis. The patients underwent Computed Tomography for sinus evaluation. Of 162 participants, 12 samples from patients showed fungal elements, 2 of them Aspergillus fulvous (1. 2 %), 9 of them Alternaria species (5. 56 %) and 1 of them Psilomysis (0. 6 %). All patients presented radiologic evidence of sinusitis, ranging from mucosal thickening to total opacity. In conclusion, results obtained showed a low prevalence of fungal sinusitis among Iranian patients with chronic sinusitis. Findings also showed that Alternaria is the most causative agent...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{etiology}} of ulcerative colitis (UC) {{is to be}} understood. The basic pathological feature of UC is intestinal chronic inflammation. Superantigen, such as Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB), is reported to compromise intestinal barrier function by increasing epithelial permeability and initiate inflammation in the intestinal mucosa. Inasmuch as anatomic position of the sinus, chronic sinusitis-derived SEB may follow the secretion and to be swallowed down to the gastrointestinal tract and induce lesions to the intestinal mucosa. Methods <b>Sinus</b> <b>wash</b> fluid (SWF, containing SEB) was collected {{from a group of}} patients with both chronic sinusitis (CS) and UC. A group of mice were sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA) in the presence of SWF. The sensitized mice were challenged with the specific antigen OVA. The inflammatory status of the colonic tissue was determined with histology, serology and electron microscopy. Using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) as a tracer, another group of mice was stimulated with SWF for 2 hours. The HRP activity was detected in the colonic tissue with enzymatic approaches and electron microscopy. Results Epithelial hyperpermeability in colonic epithelium was induced by stimulating with SWF. The HRP activity in the colonic mucosa was almost 11 times more in the SWF treated group (3. 2 ± 0. 6 μg/g tissue) than the control group (0. 3 ± 0. 1 μg/g tissue). Mice were sensitized using a mixture of SWF and OVA (serum OVA-specific IgE was detected with a highest titer as 1 : 64). Challenge with OVA induced extensive inflammation in the colonic mucosa by showing (1) marked degranulation in mast cells (MC, 46. 3 ± 4. 5 %) and eosinophils (Eo, 55. 7 ± 4. 2 %); (2) inflammatory cell infiltration (MC = 145. 2 ± 11. 4; Eo = 215. 8 ± 12. 5; mononuclear cell = 258. 4 ± 15. 3 /mm 2 tissue); (3) increased MPO activity (12. 9 ± 3. 2 U/g tissue) and inflammatory scores (1. 8 ± 0. 3); (4) mucosal surface ulcers; (5) edema in the lamina propria; (6) bacterial translocation and abscess formation in the subepithelial region. Conclusion Introducing Sinusitis-derived SEB-containing SWF to the gastrointestinal tract compromised colonic mucosal barrier function increasing epithelial permeability to luminal macromolecular protein in mice. The SWF facilitated colonic mucosal sensitization to luminal antigen. Multiple challenging the sensitized colonic mucosa with specific antigen OVA induced inflammation, induced a condition similar to human ulcerative colitis. </p...|$|E
