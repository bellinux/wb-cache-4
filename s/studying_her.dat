25|$|Some of the {{scientists}} who worked with Genie, including Jay Shurley, concluded based on non-linguistic evidence {{that she had been}} mentally retarded from birth and that this rendered it impossible to be completely certain about the utility of <b>studying</b> <b>her</b> language acquisition. During his sleep studies Shurley had uncovered, among a few other persistent abnormalities in her sleep, a highly elevated number of sleep spindles, which are characteristic of people born with severe retardation. However, the linguists who studied Genie firmly believed that she possessed at least average intelligence at birth and argued that the abuse and isolation she suffered during her childhood had left her functionally retarded. Curtiss specifically noted that some of Genie's linguistic capabilities, such as her clear ability to distinguish gender in her speech, were very uncharacteristic of someone born mentally retarded. Other linguists analyzing Genie's case, including Steven Pinker, have concurred with Curtiss' position.|$|E

2500|$|After Casablanca, with [...] "Selznick's steady boosting," [...] {{she played}} the part of Maria in For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943), which was also her first color film. For the role she {{received}} her first Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. The film was taken from Ernest Hemingway's novel of the same title. When the book was sold to Paramount Pictures, Hemingway stated that [...] "Miss Bergman, {{and no one else}} should play the part." [...] His opinion came from seeing her in her first American role, Intermezzo, although he hadn't yet met her. A few weeks later, they did meet, and after <b>studying</b> <b>her</b> he said, [...] "You are Maria!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Presiding {{over the}} {{services}} at Valtorta's [...] "privileged burial" [...] and {{the relocation of}} her remains from Viareggio to the Santissima Annunziata Basilica was Father Gabriel M. Roschini. A respected Mariologist, founding professor at the Marianum pontifical institute in Rome and advisor to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Father Roschini had studied Valtorta's writings and her book The Poem of the Man God and was initially skeptical of the authenticity of her work. But upon <b>studying</b> <b>her</b> work further he grew to appreciate it as a private revelation. He wrote of Valtorta's work: [...] "We find ourselves facing an effect (her work) {{which seems to be}} beyond its cause (Maria Valtorta)".|$|E
2500|$|In her own day, Christine de Pizan was {{primarily}} a court writer who wrote commissioned works for aristocratic families, as well as addressing literary debates of the era. In modern times, she has been labeled a poetic mediator who engaged with historical texts to interpolate her royal readers and encourage ethical and judicious conduct. Some rhetorical scholars have concluded, from <b>studying</b> <b>her</b> persuasive strategies, that she forged a rhetorical identity for herself and encouraged women to embrace this identity. Some have argued that Christine de Pizan [...] "began her literary career by singing, alone in her room, and she finished by shouting in the public square." [...] She left an influential footprint {{in the field of}} rhetorical discourse in an otherwise male-dominated literary field. She left forty-one surviving poetic works and a number of prose books. Simone de Beauvoir wrote in 1949 that Épître au Dieu d'Amour was [...] "the first time we see a woman take up her pen in defence of her sex".|$|E

2500|$|One of Wilson's {{earliest}} memories {{was hearing}} Glenn Miller's 1943 recording of George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue (1924), later citing it as a pivotal influence in his {{development as a}} composer. He recalled: [...] "Around our house, when I was a child, I heard things from my parents' record collection like Les Paul and Mary Ford, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Rosemary Clooney, and the Four Freshmen. Those were my first inspirations. To try to describe exactly what each influence was is hard to explain because it's very subtle, {{but it can be}} felt when you listen to my music. I don't think people realize just how much Rosemary Clooney affected my singing. She taught me to sing with love in my heart ... I would sing along with it , <b>studying</b> <b>her</b> phrasing, and that's how I learned to sing with feeling." [...] John Sebastian of the Lovin' Spoonful noted, [...] "Brian had control of this vocal palette of which we had no idea. We had never paid attention to the Four Freshmen or doo-wop combos like the Crew Cuts. Look what gold he mined out of that." [...] Carl speculated that it was Mike Love who got Brian into doo-wop music.|$|E
