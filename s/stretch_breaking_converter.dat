40|$|Tensile {{behaviors}} of SiC [111] nanowires with various possible microstructures {{have been investigated}} by molecular-dynamics simulations. The {{results show that the}} large plastic deformation in these nanowires is induced by the anti-parallel sliding of 3 C grains along an ultra-thin intergranular amorphous film parallel to the plane and inclined at an angle of 19. 47 ° with respect to the nanowire axis. The resulting large plastic deformation of SiC nanowires at room temperature is attributed to the <b>stretching,</b> <b>breaking</b> and re-forming of Si–C bonds in the intergranular amorphous film, which is also evident from the sawtooth jumps in the stress-strain response...|$|R

50|$|Participants {{in a group}} (from 4 to 200 people) are {{assembled}} {{at tables}} equipped with game boards and associated materials. A program leader or coordinator provides verbal instructions; then participants play the game on their own for approximately one hour. The gameplay is followed by scoring to measure team performance. After a brief <b>stretch</b> <b>break,</b> participants reconvene for a debriefing. The debrief is facilitated by the program leader with a structured progression of discussion questions, reflection exercises, didactic presentation, and group tasks to bring to light key lessons of the experience, its relevance to the group and how participants will put lessons into practice after the program.|$|R

40|$|This {{innovative}} practice project {{explores the}} needs of a local community-based healthcare nonprofit and the possibility of incorporating occupational therapy within current practice with regard to clients experiencing chronic pain. Methods included learning about the organization, interviews and observations at other local organizations that treat chronic pain, instrumental implementation of <b>stretch</b> <b>breaks</b> during pain courses, and completion of a pilot home assessment. Outcomes thus far have improved setup of pain courses and incorporated facilitated movement for clients with chronic pain who are wary to increase their level of activity. A formal assessment of home setup and activity analysis was completed for a client, which led to recommendations and educational opportunity to improve self-management of pain. Future ideas include development of occupational therapy services in addition to future projects for occupational therapy students...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study {{investigated}} {{the effect of a}} <b>stretch</b> <b>break</b> program (SBP) on the flexibility, strength and musculoskeletal complaints of storage (SW) and administrative (AW) sector workers. Twenty-six male workers were randomly selected: 16 workers from the storage sector and ten workers from the administrative sector. We applied the Physical Activity Questionnaire and Musculoskeletal Questionnaire and evaluated flexibility and grip strength before and after 6 months of the SBP. The SPB decreased the SW group members' complaints of paresthesias and numbness in the upper body and total body. The SPB reduced the AW group members' complaints of paresthesias and numbness in the upper body. Furthermore, the SPB improved cervical, trunk and left shoulder flexibility in the SW group and improved cervical and shoulder flexibility and grip strength in the AW group. The SBP contribute to improve flexibility and musculoskeletal complaints in the regions that are affected by higher rates of work-related injuries...|$|R

40|$|Things move, collide, flow, bend, heat up, cool down, <b>stretch,</b> <b>break</b> and boil. These {{and other}} things that happen to cause changes in objects over time are {{intuitively}} characterized as processes. To understand common sense physical reasoning and make machines that interact significantly with the physical world we must understand the qualitative reasoning about processes, their effects, and their limits. Qualitative Process theory defines a simple notion of physical process that appears quite useful as a language in which to write physical theories. Reasoning about processes also motivates a new qualitative representation for quantity, the Quantity Space. This paper includes the basic definitions of Qualitative Process theory, describes several different kinds of reasoning that can be performed with them, and discusses its implications for causal reasoning. The use of the theory is illustrated by several examples, including figuring out that a boiler can blow up, that an oscillator with friction will eventually stop, and how to say that you can pull with a string, but not push with it...|$|R

Since some cultures value preservation of the hymen as evidence of virginity, this can discourage young women from using cups, despite it being a false association.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Steered {{molecular}} dynamics (SMD), a computer simulation method for studying force-induced reactions in biopolymers, {{has been applied}} to investigate the response of protein do-mains to stretching apart of their terminal ends. The simulations mimic atomic force microscopy and optical tweezer experiments, but proceed on much shorter time scales. The simulations on different domains for 0. 6 nanosecond each reveal two types of protein responses: the first type, arising in certain b-sandwich domains, exhibits nanosecond unfold-ing only after a force above 1, 500 pN is applied; the second type, arising in a wider class of protein domain structures, requires significantly weaker forces for nanosecond unfolding. In the first case, strong forces are needed to concertedly break a set of interstrand hydrogen bonds which protect the domains against unfolding through stretching; in the second case, <b>stretching</b> <b>breaks</b> backbone hydro-gen bonds one by one, and does not require strong forces for this purpose. Stretching of b-sandwich (immunoglobulin) domains has been investigated further revealing a specific relationship between response to mechanical strain and the architecture of b-sandwich domains.

50|$|Although {{observed}} in humans and cats, ectopia lentis is most commonly seen in dogs. Ciliary zonules normally hold the lens in place.
