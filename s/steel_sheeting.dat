40|$|In recent times, the roofing systems made of {{thin and}} high {{strength}} <b>steel</b> roof <b>sheeting</b> and battens or purlins are predominantly {{used in the}} construction of low-rise buildings. However, such thin steel roofing systems continue to fail frequently at their screw fastener connections during high wind events such as storms and cyclones due to inadequate connection capacities. Localised pull-out failures occurring at the thin <b>steel</b> roof <b>sheeting</b> to batten or purlin connections have been the root cause for extensive loss of roofing systems under high wind uplift loads over many years. Such premature connection failures often cause partial or even complete loss of steel roofing systems and, thus allowing rainwater to cause severe damage to building contents. Therefore a detailed experimental study was conducted to investigate the pull-out failures occurring at the <b>steel</b> roof <b>sheeting</b> to batten or purlin connections. One hundred and eighty-seven small scale pull-out tests were conducted for this purpose using a range of screw fastener sizes and many thicknesses of thin steel roof battens and purlins. This paper presents the details of this experimental study and the pull-out capacity data obtained from the tests. It then presents suitable design equations and capacity reduction factors to accurately determine the pull-out capacities of screw fastener connections commonly used in steel roofing systems. In the development of design equations, 592 pull-out capacity data obtained from another experimental study at the Queensland University of Technology were also used. The new design equations can also be used for the screw fastener connections in steel wall cladding systems subject to high wind suction loads...|$|R

40|$|High wind {{events such}} as hurricanes and storms often cause severe damage to crest-fixed thin steel roof claddings. Past {{research}} on wind damage has shown that low cycle fatigue cracking of <b>steel</b> roof <b>sheeting</b> around the fastener holes has been {{the reason for the}} premature pull-through failures of roof claddings under fluctuating wind forces. Such a situation will be at its worst if the roof sheeting is already split at the fastener holes. An inspection of trapezoidal steel roofs has shown that roofing has been split in the transverse direction due to accidental or poor workmanship-caused overtightening of screw fasteners. Once split, even slightly, the roofing can only survive a few cycles of wind uplift loading. Therefore an investigation using laboratory experiments and finite element analyses was carried out to study the splitting behaviour of two commonly used high tensile steel trapezoidal roof claddings. Analytical and experimental results agreed reasonably well and presented a good understanding of the splitting behaviour of trapezoidal roof claddings. This paper presents the details of this investigation and the results...|$|R

Past wind damage investigations have shown that roof sheeting failures occurred frequently due to localized failures at their screw connections to battens. However, the batten to rafter or truss connections are now the weakest link in the uplift wind loading chain as shown by recent wind events. Therefore a detailed investigation including both experimental and numerical studies was undertaken to investigate the pull-through failures of roof battens at their connections to rafter/truss. More than 300 small scale tests of battens and two full scale tests of roofing systems were undertaken to investigate the localized pull-through failure while finite element analyses (FEA) of tested battens were also undertaken. Appropriate failure criteria were included in FEA to simulate the local pull-through failures around the screw fasteners in the bottom flanges.

40|$|Wind-induced fatigue {{loading and}} damage to roof {{claddings}} on gable-roof and hip-roof buildings are investigated {{in this study}} through both wind tunnel tests and computer analyses. The magnitude and distribution of wind pressures on both roofs are first measured at different wind directions. Fatigue characteristics of wind pressures are identified based on a rainflow count method for each tap at its critical wind direction in which its largest negative pressure occurs. Total fatigue loading at each tap on both roofs is then computed using the obtained fatigue characteristics and information on wind climate. Finally, fatigue damage to screw-fastened light-gauge <b>steel</b> roof <b>sheetings</b> of different profiles is estimated in terms of previously obtained S-N curves and a modified Miner's rule. The distributions of fatigue damage index over both roofs show that under the same strong winds, fatigue damage to the hip roof cladding is much less severe than that gable roof cladding. For each type of roof configuration, there are considerable differences in fatigue loading and fatigue damage with respect to different locations of pressure taps and different profiles of roof sheetings.

The numerical analyses are performed using a three-dimensional finite element model developed using the commercial software Abaqus, implemented using an explicit formulation. The constitutive behaviour of all materials is nonlinear. Contact regions between the concrete and steel elements are simulated using surface-to-surface and embedment techniques. Analyses are carried out for three case studies including simply-supported and continuous beams for which experimental results {{are available in the}} literature. Different realization sizes are considered for the MCS in order to evaluate their influence on the statistical characterization of the structural response. Based on the obtained results, it is observed that the adopted realization sizes provide similar statistical representation of the structural behaviour, which highlights how even a reduced number of nonlinear analyses can lead to satisfactory approximations of the statistical description of the response uncertainties in composite steel-concrete floors...|$|R

40|$|Thin {{profiled}} <b>steel</b> roof <b>sheeting</b> and battens {{are increasingly}} {{used in the}} construction of roofing systems of residential, commercial, industrial and farm buildings in Australia. The critical load combination of external wind suction and internal wind pressures that occur during high wind events such as thunderstorms and tropical cylcones often dislocate the roofing systems partially or even completely due to premature roof connection failures. Past wind damage investigations have shown that roof sheeting failures occured at their screw connections to battens. In most of these cases, the screw fastener head pulled through the thin roof sheeting whilst the screw fasteners also pulled out from the battens. Research studis undertaken on the roof sheeting to batten connection failures have improved this situation. However, the batten to rafter or truss connections have not been investigated adequately. Failure of these connections can cause the failure of the entire roof structure as observed during the recent high wind events. Therefore a detailed experimental study consisting of both small scale and full scale tests has been undertaken to investigate the steel roof batten pull-through failures in relation to many critical parameters such as steel batten geometry, thickness and grade, screw fastener head sizes and screw tightening. This paper presents the details of this experimental study and the pull-through failure load results obtained from them. Finally it discusses the development of suitable design rules {{that can be used to}} determine the pull-through connection capacities of thin steel roof battens under wind uplift loads...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{applications}} {{in the use of}} light gauge steel members have been concerned with developing large scale systems built entirely from cold-formed steel members. An explicit analysis of such structures is complicated by the different phenomena that the structure may be prone to during loading. In particular, elastic buckling phenomena is an important consideration in the design of such structures since the load at which buckling occurs often provides a close upper bound to the carrying capacity of the structure. The first part of this two-part thesis (Part I, Chaptersl- 8) has been devoted to general methods of analysis of the torsional-flexural buckling of thin-walled structures. A review of previous investigations and the available methods of solution is presented. A general finite element formulation of the torsional-flexural buckling of thin-walled structures has been derived. The resulting elastic geometric matrix can be used to analyse structures with monosymmetrical members. It also includes the effect of sectorial-monosymmetry for cross-sections without any axis of symmetry. A general transformation matrix has been developed to allow for the application of the finite element method to the three-dimensional elastic stability analysis of space and portal frames. The validity and accuracy of the new finite element formulation have been checked by analysing a number of different elastic lateral buckling problems for which exact or highly accurate solutions by other techniques are available. An experimental program was carried out on simply supported cold-formed steel z-beams. The first part of this program was undertaken to check the validity of the finite element calculations of the bimoments caused by nonuniform torsion. The second part was devoted to elastic lateral buckling of z-beams under combined bending and torsion. The second part of this thesis (Part II, Chapter 9) deals with the analysis of hipped roof structures with corrugated <b>steel</b> roof <b>sheeting.</b> A simple theoretical model has been suggested. The model has been used to perform an elastic linear analysis of the behaviour of two types of the hipped roof structures. The theoretical results are compared with previous experimental results for these two structures...|$|R
40|$|The strive {{of architects}} for maximum {{transparency}} and maximum lightness encounters {{issues in the}} cold-formed steel building industry. Closely spaced vertical members are needed to develop the unique properties these structures have, resulting however in only small openings. To increase the transparency of cold-formed <b>steel</b> frames, traditional <b>sheeting</b> materials which are screwed onto the frame are replaced by glass panes which are adhesively bonded to the frame using a structural sealant. In case of such structural hybrid cold-formed steel-glass elements, the sealant-glass system restrains the cold-formed steel members vertically, horizontally and rotationally. In this research, the horizontal translational stiffness of a linear structural sealant connection between cold-formed steel members and monolithic glass panels is determined by means of experimental testing. This paper reports about the obtained data from these experiments. Box-type specimens consisting of two cold-formed steel C-sections or tubular sections adhesively ‘sandwiched’ between two monolithic glass panels were subjected to a tensile force, such that shear must develop in the structural sealant. The horizontal translational stiffness k derived from the experimental relationship between the applied load and the relative displacement between glass and steel, had the same order of magnitude as comparable traditional screwed cold-formed steel-OSB or cold-formed steel-gypsum connections. This study, therefore, demonstrated the potential of these linear adhesive connections to provide sufficient horizontal translational stiffness of a cold-formed steel frame braced with adhesively bonded glass panels...|$|R
