500|$|Prior to {{the initial}} release, several {{modifications}} {{were made to the}} game. While changes are frequent during game development, the changes in Grand Theft Auto III were noted to be {{around the time of the}} September 11 attacks, which led to speculation that some changes were motivated by the attacks. On 19 September 2001, Rockstar delayed the game's release by three weeks, citing the attacks as an influencing factor in the delay. [...] "Everyone had someone who had an uncle or brother [...] ", <b>said</b> <b>Paul</b> Eibeler, then-president of distributor Take-Two Interactive.|$|E
500|$|When The September Issue was {{released}} three years later, critics compared {{it with the}} earlier, fictional film. [...] "For {{the past year or}} so, she's been on the media warpath to win back her image," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Paul</b> Schrodt in Slant Magazine. Many considered the question of how similar she was to Streep's Priestly, and praised the film for showing the real person. Manohla Dargis at The New York Times said that Priestly had helped humanise Wintour, and [...] "the documentary continues this." [...] "The movie offers insights that lift it beyond a realist version of The Devil Wears Prada," [...] agreed Mary Pols in Time.|$|E
500|$|In {{a speech}} at the GOP Freedom Summit in April 2014, Paul insisted that the GOP has to broaden its appeal in order to grow as a party. To do so, he said it cannot be the party of [...] "fat cats, rich people and Wall Street" [...] and that the {{conservative}} movement has never been about rich people or privilege, [...] "we are the middle class", he <b>said.</b> <b>Paul</b> also said that conservatives must present a message of justice and concern for the unemployed and be against government surveillance to attract new people to the movement, including the young, Hispanics, and blacks. During the 2014 election, Paul launched a social media campaign titled [...] "Hillary's Losers" [...] which was meant to highlight many of the Democratic candidates that lost their bids for the U.S. Senate despite endorsements from Hillary Clinton. Clinton was also a candidate for President and eventually won the Democratic Party's nomination, going on to lose to Donald Trump in the general election.|$|E

5000|$|Labey <b>said</b> that <b>Paul</b> loves Pam, his grandmother, calling their {{relationship}} [...] "beautiful". He called Paul a [...] "nana's boy" [...] who would cry to her while {{putting on a}} persona with everyone else, revealing that he never had {{to come out to}} her as gay. Paul favours Pam over Les and wants to protect her, especially when he discovers Les's supposed affair, though Labey <b>said</b> that <b>Paul</b> and Les once had a [...] "lovely relationship". Labey also <b>said</b> that <b>Paul's</b> relationship with his grandparents can be [...] "a bit difficult" [...] because their son and Paul's father is dead and they want him {{to be a part of}} Les's funeral business. When Les and Pam's relationship breaks up, Labey <b>said</b> that <b>Paul</b> is [...] "stuck between them both, trying to reason with one and convince the other", and they [...] "need Paul there to remind them of how they were as a couple." ...|$|R

500|$|A {{number of}} the newsletters, {{particularly}} in the period between 1988 and 1994 when Paul {{was no longer in}} Congress, contained material that later proved controversial. Topics included conspiracy theories, anti-government militia movements, and race wars. During Paul's 1996 congressional election campaign, and his 2008 and 2012 presidential primary campaigns, critics charged that some of the passages reflected racist, anti-Semitic, and homophobic bigotry. In a 1996 interview, Paul did not deny writing the newsletters and defended some of their contents, but specified that he opposes racism. In March 2001, Paul said he did not write the commentaries, but stopped short of denying authorship in 1996 because his campaign advisers had thought it would be too confusing and that he had to live with the material published under his name. In 2011, Paul's spokesperson Jesse Benton <b>said</b> <b>Paul</b> had [...] "taken moral responsibility because they appeared under his name and slipped through under his watch." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2005 {{there was}} {{a tidal wave of}} new wizard rock bands. The {{brothers}} do-it-yourself musical ethos has caught on with bands forming as fellow Potter fans are picking up instruments for the first time. Like Harry and the Potters, these new bands also take on the persona, or dress as a Harry Potter-themed character. Though most fans of the music are previous fans of Harry Potter, some bands have attracted listeners outside of the Harry Potter fanbase. Paul and Joe are aware of around 200 other Harry Potter-related rock bands who at least record and post songs on the Internet. The Boston Phoenix wondered—in spite of fully booked calendars—how long wizard rock would last once there are no new stories to riff on, as their musical identity is contingent on the lasting success and popularity of a book series. [...] "In some ways," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Paul,</b> [...] "we want to tie things off and consider it a done deal. We’ve always viewed this as a project that had a finite life and end point." ...|$|E
500|$|The most {{important}} advice he gives aspiring songwriters {{is to write}} what you know or what you've experienced. [...] "Use reality as the springboard to whatever you're writing about", Paul <b>said.</b> <b>Paul</b> also says that being a successful songwriter is like being a journalist who writes about what he sees and knows, the times people are living in and the things people are facing today. [...] "The journalist {{looks out the window}} and writes about what is really happening." [...] "I make sure it's real. [...] I don't want to fictionalize about things I haven't witnessed." [...] Paul states that over the years he's learned the value of simplicity in writing. He's learned that he can say more when he writes more simply and direct. [...] "It's almost as if you can be complex and intricate by adopting a shorter, less complicated structure." [...] "I'm not doing rocket science -- I'm a storyteller", he said. [...] "I hope to inspire people to think and feel and to walk out with more than they came in with." ...|$|E

[...] The teen informed detectives that Pauling had told her that if she were to ever tell officers about the relationship, she should tell him first so he could kill himself. She also <b>said</b> <b>Pauling</b> told her he wasn’t like other child molesters because he loved her.|$|R

500|$|Stastny is a left-handed {{center and}} was one of the few NHL players known to use a wood stick since 2005, preferring it through his first four seasons in the NHL. However, he made the switch to a {{graphite}} stick to begin his 2010–11 NHL season. He considers himself a playmaker, a characteristic he says he inherited from his father. Former Avalanche captain Joe Sakic, who played with Paul and Peter Stastny, sees similarities between the two, namely their strong skating and ability to see the game. Former Avalanche coach Joel Quenneville, who faced Peter during his playing career, has <b>said</b> <b>Paul</b> plays in a similar way and complimented his hockey sense. George Gwozdecky, Stastny's coach at the University of Denver, has complimented his intelligence, ability to pass and see the ice. Although it has been said that Stastny is a slow skater, Gwozdecky too feels he is a strong skater. Terry Frei of ESPN has said that [...] "...his game isn't flashy and eye-popping as much as it is heady, intuitive and efficient".|$|E
500|$|During the {{suggestion}} box scene, Larry Wilmore envisioned Dwight as an Ed McMahon-type character, repeating everything Michael <b>said.</b> <b>Paul</b> Lieberstein claimed that {{figuring out the}} logistics for the conference room scene was [...] "the heart" [...] of the episode. Hardin recalled that it was extremely difficult to stay in character, due to the humorous nature of the dialogue and the cast members' reactions. In fact, the cast broke more than usual during filming. During the scene, Michael reads a suggestion from someone named Tom, who asks for better help for people with depression. After inquiring who this mysterious Tom is, Phyllis tells Michael that he worked in accounting several years ago and committed suicide. Wilmore claimed during the DVD commentary for the episode that the writers would be bringing {{him back in the}} show's third season, in which his backstory would be explained, although this never panned out. However, during the Writer's Block Q session at The Office Convention in 2007, the writers, perhaps sardonically, suggested that Tom's death was the reason that Ryan was brought in as a temporary worker. Tom's name is briefly seen on Dwight's organization chart in the fourth season episode [...] "Did I Stutter?", where his name is revealed to be Tom Peets.|$|E
500|$|Video content {{director}} [...] George Elizando {{and video}} engineer Steven Davis controlled the video surfaces using a Pinnacle i9000 switcher and an expanded Vista Systems Spyder system. Graphics on the LED walls were fed from a custom video playback system that incorporated three Green Hippo media servers; {{some of the}} video content was filmed during rehearsals and were meant for Cyrus to interact with onstage. Visual magnification was executed through the usage of Ikegami Tsushinki HL-45 cameras and multiple strategically located point-of-view cameras, in order to cover the show from every angle. Extensive amounts of teamwork was necessitated {{to set up the}} complex video system at each venue, particularly for weekend daytime performances, as they had less time. Mark Woody, Steve [...] "Bone" [...] Gray, Justin McLean, and Dane Mustola set up the video structures, while Evan Huff and crew chief Eric Geiger built the video thrust into the audience and installed the live cameras. [...] "Thanks to these talented designers a show commensurate with Hannah's popularity has been created", <b>said</b> <b>Paul</b> Becher, co-CEO of Nocturne Productions. For audio, Cyrus used Sennheiser's MD 5235 dynamic capsule atop the SKM 5200 wireless handheld transmitter nightly. Sixteen channels of Sennheiser G2 wireless monitors were programmed to ensure that performers could hear what was being played amidst massive, and fervid screams from the audience. Sennheiser 500 series wireless guitar and bass systems were also used.|$|E

500|$|After the film's {{release and}} unusually strong box office {{performance}} over {{its first two}} weeks, it was debated as the one film capable of surpassing Titanics worldwide gross, and its continued strength perplexed box office analysts. Other films in recent years had been cited as contenders for surpassing Titanic, such as 2008's The Dark Knight, but Avatar was considered the first film with a genuine chance to do so, and its numbers being aided by higher ticket prices for 3D screenings did not fully explain its success to box office analysts. [...] "Most films {{are considered to be}} healthy if they manage anything less than a 50% drop from their first weekend to their second. Dipping just 11% from the first to the third is unheard of," [...] <b>said</b> <b>Paul</b> Dergarabedian, president of box-office analysis for Hollywood.com. [...] "This is just unprecedented. I had to do a double take. I thought it was a miscalculation." [...] Analysts predicted second place for the film's worldwide gross, but most were uncertain about it surpassing Titanic because [...] "Today's films flame out much faster than they did when Titanic was released." [...] Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, believed in the film's chances of becoming the highest-grossing film of all time, though he also believed it was too early to surmise because it had only played during the holidays. He said, [...] "While Avatar may beat Titanics record, it will be tough, and the film is unlikely to surpass Titanic in attendance. Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s." [...] Cameron said he did not think it was realistic to [...] "try to topple Titanic off its perch" [...] because it [...] "just struck some kind of chord" [...] and there had been other good films in recent years. He changed his prediction by mid-January. [...] "It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time," [...] he said.|$|E

[...] "These cases were a good vehicle for the courts to address the protections that were to be accorded free speech, the free press and free exercise of religion.

[...] It was later {{revealed that}} he would be a potential love interest for established character Ben Mitchell. Labey <b>said</b> that <b>Paul's</b> usual type of men was [...] "harder, bigger, muscly tattooed guys", but said that Ben has a [...] "Mitchell persona", which excites Paul, and he enjoys the [...] "tease of trying to get Ben to come out", because he has a girlfriend in Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald). He also <b>said</b> that <b>Paul</b> is drawn to the fact that Ben has a girlfriend because [...] "it's all part of the chase" [...] and their relationship is [...] "playful and mischievous", but <b>said</b> that <b>Paul</b> respects that Ben struggles with coming to terms with his sexuality. Harry Reid, who plays Ben, <b>said</b> that <b>Paul</b> is [...] "an outlet for Ben's true feelings", and that [...] "Paul is much softer than Ben". Labey said that [...] "Paul is excited by Ben." [...] Labey went on to explain that Paul and Ben's relationship starts of as flirting and [...] "blossoms over the summer", but he hoped it would be a [...] "slow burner" [...] that would [...] "work on different levels", instead of [...] "Ben's desperation and Paul feeling fed up", saying he hoped they would learn to trust each other and Ben would feel safe and comfortable with <b>Paul.</b> He <b>said</b> that <b>Paul's</b> attraction to Ben changes over time: initially he is attracted to Ben's [...] "bad-boy reputation" [...] but then sees a [...] "more fragile" [...] side to him and they discover they have more in common. Ben and Paul's relationship was given the portmanteau [...] "Baul" [...] by Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy.|$|R

[...] "That's what freedom is all about, taking your own risks," [...] Paul <b>said.</b> <b>Paul</b> mentioned {{he does not}} believe society should let the aforementioned hypothetical man die but emphasized that churches and communities – rather than governments – should take care of those in need.|$|E
