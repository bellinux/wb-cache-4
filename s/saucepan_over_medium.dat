50|$|A bread-like dish {{similar to}} the calentita. Sharing its Italian origins, it is a {{descendant}} of the Genoese dish with the same name. Unlike calentita the ingredients are first simmered in a <b>saucepan</b> for <b>over</b> an hour, stirring constantly, to form a paste which is then left to set. When the polenta-like dough is set, it is cut into small strips and fried in olive oil.|$|R

I sat down opposite and cried too, while helping him to hold a <b>saucepan</b> lid <b>over</b> the poor little creatures, and thus there sprang up a friendship between us, which grew.|$|R

30|$|The patch size {{found in}} our study {{overlaps}} with that found by one other study that examined spatial autocorrelation in fire temperature during low-intensity surface fires. Franklin et al. (1997) found that fire temperatures in upland oak forests were spatially autocorrelated <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> scales (13 to 46 m). These comparisons {{lend support to the}} idea that low-intensity surface fires in longleaf pine are patchy <b>over</b> <b>medium</b> scales, as opposed to the finer scales that may be typical of high intensity fires. Therefore, while the fires examined in our study did not have a narrowly definable patch size, it may be possible that the patch size of fires can be predicted based on fuel type and stand characteristics over more broadly defined scales (< 10 m, 10 – 200 m, > 200 m). More comparative studies that report spatial autocorrelation are needed to examine this.|$|R
