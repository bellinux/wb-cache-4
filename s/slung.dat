5|$|Independent slinger {{units are}} not attested in the epigraphic {{record of the}} Principate. However, slingers are portrayed on Trajan's Column. They are shown unarmoured, wearing a short tunic. They carry a cloth bag, <b>slung</b> in front, to hold their shot (glandes).|$|E
5|$|Of the ratings, 122 were Royal Marines. As an {{experiment}} during the ship's first commission, all of Warriors marines were from Royal Marine Artillery; subsequently some marine infantrymen were assigned {{as was the}} usual naval practice. The marines manned the aft section of guns and <b>slung</b> their hammocks between the crew's accommodation and the officers' cabins.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the crew lived on the single gun deck of the Warrior; these crewmen slept in hammocks <b>slung</b> from the sides and deck beams, with up to 18 men between each pair of guns. The officers berthed {{in the rear of}} the ship in small individual cabins; the wardroom was also the officers' mess. The captain had two spacious, well-furnished cabins.|$|E
5|$|On stage, {{the band}} adopted a focused {{approach}} directly intended {{to increase the}} audience's concert experience. Johnny's instructions to C.J. when preparing for his first live performances with the group were to play facing the audience, to stand with the bass <b>slung</b> low between spread legs, and to walk forward {{to the front of}} stage {{at the same time as}} he did. Johnny was not a fan of guitarists who performed facing their drummer, amplifier, or other band members.|$|E
5|$|Ann Bannon {{was born}} Ann Weldy in Joliet, Illinois, in 1932. She {{grew up in}} nearby Hinsdale {{with her mother and}} stepfather, and had the {{responsibility}} of taking care of four siblings due to the family's financial problems. She took comfort in a vibrant imaginary life during this time and found solace in writing. Growing up, she was surrounded by music, particularly jazz, as her family hosted small recitals for friends and neighbors. One became a character in her books: a perennial bachelor named Jack who <b>slung</b> jokes and witticisms at the audiences.|$|E
5|$|In town, Creger {{watched as}} a forward element of the German {{infantry}} advanced, with weapons <b>slung,</b> into Lanzerath. They obviously {{did not expect to}} encounter any Americans. Creger radioed Bouck and told him of the Germans advancing through Lanzerath on the road between Creger and Bouck's position. Bouck sent Robinson, McGeehee and Silvola to assist Creger, who crept down to the Bucholz Station road and thence up a ditch towards Lanzerath. Before the three men reached Creger, he left the village using a more direct route. As he returned to the American lines, he engaged and killed or wounded most of a German platoon.|$|E
5|$|Sounders coach Schmid made {{adjustments}} to his usual starting lineup. Pappa {{did not start}} due to a recent return from international duty with Guatemala, while star striker Martins was on the bench as well. Although he won the Golden Boot for most goals scored, Cooper was primarily a bench player throughout the year and did not start the match. Although lacking those playmakers, the Sounders came out attacking, and their first big chance came in the 10th minute when Rose <b>slung</b> a low cross near {{the face of the}} goal to Dempsey, whose resulting shot was off-frame.|$|E
5|$|The main method {{employed}} by most medium-wave or short-wave pirate stations during the 1960s and 70s involved programming played back on cassette recorders (often {{powered by a}} car battery), with a long wire antenna <b>slung</b> up between two trees. Around this time, VHF/FM transmitters were being built by more adventurous builders. A surge in pirate radio occurred when cheap portable transmitters became available and by the mid-1980s a 50 watt radio transmitter could be obtained for around £200, or could be built for less. The operation of a pirate radio station required a good quality cassette recorder, a transmitter and a high roof, with tower blocks providing the ideal transmission site for pirate radio stations. A 40 watt transmitter broadcasting {{from the roof of}} a fifteen storey tower block could reach a forty-mile radius. Radio shows were often pre-recorded at home, with the pirate radio station operators setting up temporary transmitters on the roof of tower blocks.|$|E
5|$|The {{operation}} continued {{under the}} leadership of Matthews, the company 2IC, who had taken command almost immediately after the company commander was wounded. Under his command, each of the platoons assaulted a different cluster of buildings to which they had been assigned during training on the replica village at Hastings. The West Side Boys' ammunition store was found and secured and, once the rest of the buildings had been cleared, the paras took up defensive positions to block any potential counter-attack and patrols went into the immediate jungle in search of any West Side Boys hiding in the bushes. The village was completely secure by 08:00 and the paras secured the approaches with Claymore mines and mortars positioned to prevent a counter-attack, while a detachment destroyed the remaining vehicles and heavy weapons including the Bedford lorry which had blocked the Royal Irish patrol. The paras also recovered the Royal Irish patrol's Land Rovers, which were <b>slung</b> under the Chinooks and removed. The last British soldiers left the area at approximately 14:00.|$|E
5|$|Toward 12:30 pm Lannes {{moved the}} rest of his force to face Gottesheim in a hook shape, while Kaim {{attacked}} again, but this time against Victor’s wings. A Laufbrücke (small bridge) was thrown over the Fontanone and supported by reserve artillery. GM Christoph von Latterman’s grenadiers crossed to engage Olivier Macoux Rivaud de la Raffinière’s two demibrigades defending Marengo village, while Bellegarde and Frimont’s four squadrons split Watrin off. Although Rivaud retook the village, O’Reilly had taken Stortiglione by 2:00 pm, and in the north, Ott prepared to send FML Joseph von Schellenberg’s column to support Gottesheim. After securing the Fontanone bridge, Pilatti’s cavalry crossed but were again charged and defeated by Kellermann. However, Victor could no longer hold his positions and withdrew southeast to the main vine belt (grape vines <b>slung</b> among mulberry trees), Lannes mirroring the move. The Marengo farm garrison was abandoned and at around 2:30 pm Melas led two cavalry squadrons to capture them.|$|E
5|$|After dark, the 48th Battalion {{took over}} the line from the {{remainder}} of the 9th Division. The 47th Battalion was still on its right, and on the left was the British V Corps. The 48th Battalion occupied a small salient between Albert and Dernancourt. During the night, desultory artillery and machine gun fire was directed at the battalion's positions. In the early morning light of 28 March, the forward two companies could make out German infantry advancing through the fog. They approached without the coverage of a barrage, and in quite close formation, some had their rifles <b>slung.</b> The men of the 48th Battalion quickly brought their weapons to bear and the Germans stopped advancing. A minor break through on the right-flanking 47th Battalion was quickly dealt with and thirty prisoners taken. During the day, the Germans advanced another eight times, each time more cautiously and with a little more fire support. But each time the Australians beat them back. By evening the Germans appeared to have withdrawn, and the 48th Battalion had suffered the loss of 62 men. That night and the next two days passed relatively quietly, with Leane rotating his companies through the front line posts, with characteristic care not to create congestion in the forward areas. The battalion was relieved on the night of 30 March.|$|E
5|$|During the Yayoi {{period from}} about 300BC to 300AD, iron tools and weapons such as knives, axes, swords or spears, were {{introduced}} to Japan from China via the Korean peninsula. Shortly after this event, Chinese, Korean, and eventually Japanese swordsmiths produced ironwork locally. Swords were forged to imitate Chinese blades: generally straight chokutō with faulty tempering. Worn <b>slung</b> from the waist, they were likely used as stabbing and slashing weapons. Although functionally it would generally be more accurate to define them as hacking rather than slashing weapons. Swordmaking centers developed in Yamato, San'in and Mutsu where various types of blades such as tsurugi, tōsu and tachi were produced. Flat double-edged (hira-zukuri) blades originated in the Kofun period, and around the mid-Kofun period swords evolved from thrusting to cutting weapons. Ancient swords were also religious objects according to the 8th century chronicles Nihon Shoki and Kojiki. In fact, one of the Imperial Regalia of Japan is a sword, and swords have been discovered in ancient tumuli or handed down as treasures of Shinto shrines or Buddhist temples. Few ancient blades (jokotō) exist because the iron has been corroded by humidity.|$|E
5|$|In 1860 the Clifton Bridge Company {{was set up}} {{to oversee}} the final stages of {{completion}} and manage the operation of the bridge. They paid £50 each year to the trustees who gradually purchased the shares in the company. The revenues from tolls were minimal initially as there was not much traffic; however, this increased after 1920 with greater car ownership. In 1949 the trustees purchased all the outstanding shares and debentures. The bridge is managed by a charitable trust, originally formed by the Society of Merchant Venturers following Vick's bequest. The trust was authorised to manage the bridge and collect tolls by Acts of Parliament in 1952, 1980 and 1986. A toll of £0.50 has been levied on vehicles since 2007, but the £0.05 toll that the Act allows for cyclists or pedestrians is not collected. Human toll collectors were replaced by automated machines in 1975. The tolls are used to pay for the upkeep of the bridge, including the strengthening of the chain anchor points, which was done in 1925 and 1939, and regular painting and maintenance, which is carried out from a motorised cradle <b>slung</b> beneath the deck. By 2008 over 4 million vehicles crossed the bridge each year.|$|E
5|$|Having {{heard all}} of that, the brother took two pistols, poured more gunpowder, and {{sharpened}} the flints; {{he put the}} pistols into his belt, placed the knife between them, and <b>slung</b> a musket over his shoulder. He set forth. He passed through the dark forest; he came beneath the stair-like cliff; {{the moon and the}} stars were shining, so it was like a day; a silence all around him, pleasant; he sat down and lit his pipe. Before long a wisp of cloud showed from the direction of Mount Rumija; there came a roar and bluster, and everything happened as the sick man said. His hair rose so that three times he jammed his cap down on his head. Finally, three bulls fell down from the storm cloud and started to fight; all as it was said. He stabbed the pied bull in the neck with the knife; it staggered and fell; the light-haired bull got encouraged. Then he stabbed the dark-haired bull, and it slumped; the light-haired was finishing them off with its horns. This was not enough for him, and, fearing that the cut bulls could still rise up, he kept on striking them with the knife as long as there was a breath in their bodies. The storm cloud suddenly disappeared; together with it, the light-haired bull vanished. Again the moon and the stars shone; again a silence and blessedness. He was going back home as if flying; when he arrived he found his brother sitting by the hearth, placing logs on the fire, healthy as if he had never been sick.|$|E
5|$|Raising the Mary Rose meant {{overcoming}} {{a number}} of delicate problems {{that had never been}} encountered before. The raising of the Swedish warship Vasa 1959–61 was the only comparable precedent, but it had been a relatively straightforward operation since the hull was completely intact and rested upright on the seabed. It had been raised with basically the same methods as were in use in Tudor England: cables were <b>slung</b> under the hull and attached to two pontoons {{on either side of the}} ship which was then gradually raised and towed into shallower waters. Only one third of the Mary Rose was intact and she lay deeply embedded in mud. If the hull were raised in the traditional way, there was no guarantee that it would have enough structural strength to hold together out of water. Many suggestions for raising the ship were discarded, including the construction of a cofferdam around the wreck site, filling the ship with small buoyant objects (such as ping pong balls) or even pumping brine into the seabed and freezing it so that it would float and take the hull with it. After lengthy discussions it was decided in February 1980 that the hull would first be emptied of all its contents and strengthened with steel braces and frames. It would then be lifted to the surface with floating sheerlegs attached to nylon strops passing under the hull and transferred to a cradle. It was also decided that the ship would be recovered before the end of the diving season in 1982. If the wreck stayed uncovered any longer it risked irreversible damage from biological decay and tidal scouring.|$|E
25|$|Many {{photographs}} of Clover, heavily bearded, depict his chloroform apparatus <b>slung</b> over his shoulder.|$|E
25|$|A K-MAX {{has been}} used for {{demolition}} work by having a wrecking ball as a <b>slung</b> load.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} suspension bridges were ropes <b>slung</b> {{across a}} chasm, with a deck possibly {{at the same}} level or hung below the ropes such that the rope had a catenary shape.|$|E
25|$|Conversion by Vertol Aircraft (Canada) {{of eight}} Royal Canadian Air Force H-21s for {{civilian}} use. Equipped to carry 19 passengers or 2,820lb (1,279kg) of internal cargo or a 5,000lb (2,268kg) <b>slung</b> load.|$|E
25|$|A Skycrane {{also appears}} in the 2001 film Swordfish, near the climactic ending {{in which it has}} a bus full of hostages <b>slung</b> loaded underneath, and is flying through {{downtown}} Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|In the 1967 James Bond film You Only Live Twice a KV-107 has an {{electromagnet}} <b>slung</b> loaded underneath, {{and is used}} to airlift an antagonist's car off the road, thereby {{freeing up}} 007 from their pursuit.|$|E
25|$|The {{cab forward}} design was {{characterized}} by the long, low <b>slung</b> windshield, and relatively short overhangs. The wheels were effectively pushed to {{the corners of the}} car, creating a much larger passenger cabin than the contemporaries of the time.|$|E
25|$|The first {{examples}} of the type were equipped with two enclosed cars <b>slung</b> from {{the underside of the}} envelope – a control car, and to the rear an engineers' car (power or engine car), joined by an exposed wooden walk-way suspended on cables.|$|E
25|$|Short cloaks or capes, usually hip-length, {{often with}} sleeves, were worn by fashionable men, usually <b>slung</b> artistically over the left shoulder, even indoors; a fashion of the 1630s matched the cape fabric to the {{breeches}} and its lining to the doublet. Long cloaks were worn for inclement weather.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to operating from the carrier deck, the TS-1s served {{for several years}} in floatplane configuration aboard destroyers, cruisers, and battleships. The aircraft were <b>slung</b> over the side by crane. Squadron VO-1 operated this way from 1922, and VF-1 flew its float-equipped TS-1s from battleships in 1925 and 1926.|$|E
25|$|Since 1904, the fluted {{top surface}} to the {{radiator}} grille has been Daimler's distinguishing feature. This motif {{developed from the}} heavily finned water-cooling tubes <b>slung</b> externally {{at the front of}} early cars. Later, a more conventional, vertical radiator had a heavily finned header tank. Eventually these fins were echoed on a protective grille shell and, even later, on the rear licence plate holder.|$|E
25|$|During the 17th and 18th centuries, {{the shorter}} smallsword became an {{essential}} fashion accessory in European {{countries and the}} New World, though in some places such as the Scottish Highlands large swords as the basket-hilted broadsword were preferred, and most wealthy men and military officers carried one <b>slung</b> from a belt. Both the smallsword and the rapier remained popular dueling swords well into the 18th century.|$|E
25|$|On 8 January 1977 {{when he was}} at Piha Beach for the {{re-opening}} of the Piha Surf Life Saving Club club-house {{after the}} Project 40 rebuild, he joined the Auckland Rescue Helicopter lifeguards jumping into the surf from the helicopter. He was lifted {{out of the water and}} transported back to the beach <b>slung</b> under the helicopter using the rescue strop connected into the cargo hook.|$|E
25|$|The gas was {{stored in}} {{reservoirs}} <b>slung</b> under the underframe and these ruptured in the collision. Escaping gas was ignited by the coal-burning fires of the engines. The gas reservoirs {{had been filled}} before leaving Larbert, and this, {{and the lack of}} available water, meant that the fire was not extinguished until the morning of the next day, despite the best efforts of railway staff and the Carlisle fire brigade.|$|E
25|$|The {{lifeboats}} {{were intended}} to be launched from davits supplied by the Welin Davit & Engineering Company of London. All lifeboats but the collapsibles were <b>slung</b> from the davits, ready to be launched. The davits were of a highly efficient double-acting quadrant design, capable of being <b>slung</b> inboard (hanging over the deck) as well as outboard (hanging over the side) to pick up additional lifeboats. The davits aboard Titanic were capable of accommodating 64 lifeboats, though only 16 were actually fitted to them. The collapsibles were also intended to be launched via the davits. Each davit was doubled up, supporting the forward arm of one boat and the after arm of the next one along. A bitt and sheave was located at the keel of each davit to facilitate the lowering of boats, and the falls could be taken across the deck so {{that a number of}} men could work simultaneously on each boat and davit. They had to be lowered by hand, ideally by a team of between eight and ten men. Despite Titanic having a number of electric winches, they could only have been used to winch the lifeboats back out of the water.|$|E
25|$|The sinus (literally, a bay or inlet) {{appears in}} the Imperial era as a loose over-fold, <b>slung</b> from beneath the left arm, {{downwards}} across the chest, then upwards to the right shoulder. It functioned as a pouch or pocket. Early examples are slender, rather like the slim, tighter crosswise fold known as the balneus (sword belt) from which the sinus probably derives. Later form of sinus are much fuller; the loop hangs at knee-length, suspended there by draping over the crook of the right arm.|$|E
25|$|Approval {{to build}} prototypes {{of the new}} fighter, {{designated}} Ki-93, was given on 22 February 1943. The Ki-93 was a low-winged monoplane of all metal construction, with the crew of two sitting in tandem under a canopy {{at the front of}} the fuselage, and a ventral gondola <b>slung</b> under the fuselage to accommodate large cannons. The wing was of laminar flow section. Two variants were planned, the Ki-93-Ia bomber destroyer, armed with a 57mm and two 20mm cannon, and the Ki-93-Ib anti-shipping aircraft, which would have a 75mm gun in the gondola and would also carry two 250kg (550lb) bombs.|$|E
25|$|Bartlett {{ordered the}} {{watertight}} doors closed, sent a distress signal, {{and ordered the}} crew to prepare the lifeboats. An SOS signal was immediately sent out and was received by several other ships in the area, among them were HMS Scourge and HMS Heroic, but Britannic heard nothing in reply; unknown to either Bartlett or the ship's wireless operator, {{the force of the}} first explosion had caused the aerial communication wires <b>slung</b> between the ship's masts to snap. This meant that although the ship could still send out transmissions by wireless, she could no longer receive them.|$|E
25|$|The Gorgon V {{project was}} begun in 1950 {{to develop an}} air-to-surface missile capable of {{dispersing}} chemical warfare agents over a combat area. Designing of the missile was contracted to the Glenn L. Martin Company, which used the company's earlier PTV-N-2 Gorgon IV ramjet test missile {{as a basis for}} the weapon's design. The Gorgon V was to be a long slender missile, with swept wings and conventional tail. The Gorgon IV's ramjet engine, <b>slung</b> beneath the missile's tail, was replaced in the Gorgon V with a X14A aerosol generator, developed by the Edo Aircraft Corporation.|$|E
25|$|The T3M {{was a large}} single-engined biplane {{capable of}} being fitted with either a {{conventional}} tailwheel undercarriage or floats. The fuselage was constructed of welded steel tube {{in place of the}} riveted steel frame of the CS/SC, with the pilot and bombardier seated {{side by side in the}} front cockpit situated forward of the wing, with the bombardier having a position under the nose for aiming the aircraft's bombs or torpedoes, while the gunner had a cockpit well aft of the wing, with a radiator <b>slung</b> under the top wing between the cockpits. Power was from a 575hp (429kW) Wright T-3B V-12 engine. 24 T3M-1s were built.|$|E
25|$|The 20th century {{ranch house}} style {{has its roots}} in North American Spanish colonial {{architecture}} of the 17th to 19th century. These buildings used single story floor plans and native materials in a simple style {{to meet the needs of}} their inhabitants. Walls were often built of adobe brick and covered with plaster, or more simply used board and batten wood siding. Roofs were low and simple, and usually had wide eaves to help shade the windows from the Southwestern heat. Buildings often had interior courtyards which were surrounded by a U shaped floor plan. Large front porches were also common. These low <b>slung,</b> thick-walled, rustic working ranches were common in the Southwestern states.|$|E
