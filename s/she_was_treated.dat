5|$|The {{marriage}} between Teresa Cristina and PedroII never became passionately romantic, although a bond based upon family, mutual respect and fondness did develop. The Empress was a dutiful spouse and unfailingly supported the Emperor's positions and never interposed {{with her own}} views in public. She remained silent {{on the topic of}} his suspected extra-marital relationships—including a liaison with her daughters' governess. In turn, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> with unfailing respect and her position at Court and home was always secure. Of the four children Teresa Cristina bore him, two boys died in infancy and a daughter of typhoid fever at the early age of 24.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} between Teresa Cristina and PedroII never became passionately romantic. However, a bond based upon family, mutual respect and fondness did develop. The Empress was a dutiful spouse and unfailingly supported the Emperor's positions. She was {{silent on the}} subject of his relationships with other women, suspected or otherwise. In turn, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> with utmost respect and there was no question of her position ever being threatened or called into question. No more children were born after July 1848, even after the death of her two sons in infancy. A likely reason for the halt to childbearing is that the Emperor became more attracted to other women who possessed beauty, wit and intelligence which the Empress could not provide.|$|E

In 2015, Serena decided to end her 14-year boycott and played.|$|E
25|$|In UP, Belmonte {{experienced}} prejudice {{for being}} a Filipino of Chinese ancestry.

25|$|Furthermore, a devadasi was {{believed}} to be immune from widowhood and was called akhanda saubhagyavati ("woman never separated from good fortune").

25|$|Rigg was {{initially}} {{unhappy with the}} way <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>treated</b> by the show's producers. During her first series she learned she was being paid less than the camera man. She demanded a raise, to put her more {{on a par with}} her co-star, or she would leave the show. The producers gave in, thanks to the show's great popularity in the US.
