40|$|The main tides {{affecting}} Dagang {{sea level}} are analyzed {{and the national}} height datum is studied by analyzing 1980 — 2011 hourly tidal data and 1952 — 2007 monthly mean tidal data. Firstly, the frequencies and amplitudes of main tides including 180 short-period tides and 6 long-period tides are gained by the Fouirer transform. Then the actual amplitudes and their variations of main tides are obtained by the harmonic analysis of the 1980 — 2011 hourly tidal data, and the changes with about 19 year period can easily {{be found in the}} amplitudes of Q 1 、 O 1 、 M 2 、 K 1 、K 2. And then the changes of the mean sea level at Dagang tidal gauge defining national height datum during the period of 1952 — 2011 are studied by the harmonic analysis and the <b>shifting</b> <b>average</b> of 18. 61 year tidal heights. The results of these methods show that the mean sea level at Dagang tidal gauge descended with the speed of 1. 07 mm/a and 0. 76 mm/a respectively during 1952 — 1980, and that it ascended with the speed of 1. 59 mm/a and 1. 62 mm/a respectively during 1980 — 2011. And finally the difference of 0. 14 cm is achieved by the <b>shifting</b> <b>average</b> of 18. 61 year tidal heights for 1985 National Height Datum...|$|E

40|$|Super-Resolution (SR) {{involves}} the registration of multiple images/frames and reconstruction {{of a single}} higher resolution image. The goal {{of this research is}} to use multiple, very-low resolution images, such as those produced from a video sequence in a wireless sensor network system, as input to the super-resolution process in a face recognition system. The algorithm used for face recognition is the Fisherfaces method with a nearest neighbor classifier used for the recognition decision. Superresolution consists of two stages, a registration stage and a reconstruction stage. ^ The testing images were segmented using a simple skin color detection approach. After the cropping, the images were combined into groups of four from a sliding window that would take the current image and the following three images repeating this process by moving to the next image in the sequence and the subsequent three images {{until the end of the}} current class, or person, is reached. This same sliding window was used for the super-resolution algorithm using faces from the three people or classes. Each group of four images was used as an input to the Keren registration algorithm where the rotational and translation information was saved that was then entered into the robust super-resolution reconstruction algorithm to create a single high quality image, which was processed by the face recognition algorithm. The methods tested to compare were the average of the same groups of four, the centroid <b>shifted</b> <b>average</b> and the minimum of the four faces in the group. The comparison was based on nearest neighbor classifier and on classification rates. The results were not in favor of the super-resolution method but instead, the centroid <b>shifted</b> <b>average</b> was the best in this study. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Sometimes, {{quality of}} a process is {{characterized}} by a relationship between two variables referred to as profile. So far, several methods have been proposed for monitoring simple linear profiles. In all of the researches, the performance of the proposed methods is only investigated under step shifts. However, the other types of shifts such as drift can occur in the process and control charts should detect them as well. In this paper, phase II monitoring of simple linear profiles is investigated and the performance of more popular methods in the literature including T 2, EWMA-R, and EWMA- 3 is evaluated under drift <b>shift.</b> <b>Average</b> run length criterion is used for this purpose. The results show that the EWMA- 3 method roughly performs better than the other methods. It is roughly similar to the results obtained under the step shifts...|$|R

40|$|Aerosol {{administration}} via small-volume nebulizers {{are still}} being used by selected patient-population. In the economic market, several nebulizer designs have become available, with each incorporating unique features that will potentially establish it as the preferred choice in aerosol delivery. With the continuous rising {{cost of health care}} services, clinicians are faced with the task of identifying opportunities for cost reduction in respiratory care. PURPOSE: The {{purpose of this study was}} to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of dosimetric nebulization using the Circulaire system and the traditional VixOne nebulizer. The desired outcome was to elevate awareness of the potential impact of the Circulaire, and how its adoption might reduce costs and enhance productivity in respiratory care. METHODS: A retrospective study using existing data collected from an urban tertiary adult hospital with a Level II Trauma Center was completed. DATA ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistics were run for each variable. The total cost of a full-time Registered Respiratory Therapist (RRT) with benefits per hour was calculated. The average number of RRTs per 12 -hour <b>shift,</b> <b>average</b> number of nebulizer treatments by an RRT per 12 -hour <b>shift,</b> <b>average</b> costs of traditional VixOne nebulizer and the Circulaire system were also calculated. RESULTS: Descriptive statistics indicated the annual cost of delivering aerosol therapy using the traditional VixOne nebulizer at 9 -minutes treatment time to be $ 114, 263. 25 per year. The Circulaire was compared at two different treatment times of 5 -minutes and 3 -minutes, and the annual costs were $ 137, 422. 50 per year and $ 116, 982. 50 respectively. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted, and the treatment load was increased by 30 %, with a reduction to 5 RRTs per shift. Data indicated an annual savings of 8 % with the Circulaire at 5 -minutes treatment time, and 21 % with the Circulaire at 3 -minutes treatment time.

40|$|The {{computation}} of {{the average}} of random signals is addressed in this article. These averaging techniques are particularly relevant for Doppler blood flow clinical evaluation and research that usually accesses clinical indicators related to maximum and mean frequency, bandwidth and power variation over time.

Biomech. Eng., 105, 398 - 404, 1983.). While the latter method is an iterative one, which sometimes does not converge, the former is a sequential technique, guaranteeing convergence. Clinical Doppler blood flow signals were averaged using both methods and the resulting waveforms were evaluated against the original signals, emphasising {{the impact on the}} relevant spectral parameters. The results obtained showed that, except for the maximum error in the computation of power variation over time, the errors produced are reduced by the proposed new algorithm.
