We do this, as opposed to quantitatively scaling the different proxies relative to one another (e.g., Ito et al. 2017; Lautze et al. 2017; Siler et al. 2017), because we cannot quantitatively constrain with site-specific data at either Tuscarora or Neal Hot Spring how, for example, upwelling potential or geothermal production potential associated with critically stressed faults quantitatively relates to upwelling potential associated with fault terminations or fault intersections.|$|R

The immunocytochemical ABC tech-nique was applied to archival tissue material of neuroendocrine lung tumours: lung carcinoids, including typical carcinoids (TC), atypical carcinoids (AC) and small-cell lung cancers (SCLC) and squamous cell lung cancers (non-small cell lung cancers, NSCLC). Expression of IL- 2 was detected in all types of lung tu-mours. The highest frequency of IL- 2 expression (93 %) was noted and the most pronounced <b>semi-quantitatively</b> <b>evaluated</b> expression of IL- 2 was detected in AC tumour cells. The expression was more pronounced as compared to neo-plastic SCLC (p = 0. 01) and NSCLC cells (p = 0. 005). The results suggest a negative correlation between IL- 2 expression and the proliferative activity of tumour cells (evaluated by expression of Ki- 67) in AC.

40|$|Objectives: At present, {{sufficient}} prognostic markers {{for prostate}} cancer (PCa) progression are still lacking, in spite of thorough investigation. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate abnormalities of β-catenin protein expression, subcellular localization and determine its relation to different clinicopathological features and disease free survival in prostate cancer patients. Patients and methods: Forty prostate cancer specimens, obtained from patients with different stages of prostate cancer (83 % stage IV) who underwent a radical prostatectomy or TURP flanked by 2006 and 2011, β-catenin was determined by immuno-histochemistry (IHC). The membranous expression was <b>semi-quantitatively</b> <b>evaluated</b> in four scores (0, 1 +, 2 +, 3 +). Clinical records of these patients were studied for follow up data. Results: β-Catenin immune staining results show over-expression of β-catenin in PCa Libyan patients. There was no statistically significant difference in β-catenin immune expression as regards histopathological type, perineural invasion, tumor stage, biological recurrence. However, β-catenin over-expression showed significant correlation with old age (p <  0. 014). Conclusions: We concluded that changes in expression and cell distribution of β-catenin correlated with the progression degree of prostate adenocarcinoma, signifying a role of this molecule as a marker of progression and prognosis. Further investigations, on a larger and more heterogeneous population, should be carried out to validate and extend our results...|$|R

Sidestream dark-field (SDF) imaging has recently emerged as a noninvasive tool for capturing real-time video images of sublingual microcirculation in critically ill patients with sepsis. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the utility of SDF in determining underlying infection in patients with cirrhosis. Sublingual microcirculation was compared among patients with compensated cirrhosis (Group A, n = 13), cirrhosis without sepsis (Group B, n = 18), cirrhosis with sepsis (Group C, n = 14), and sepsis only (Group D, n = 10). The blood flow was <b>semi-quantitatively</b> <b>evaluated</b> in four equal quadrants in small (10 – 25 mm); medium (26 – 50 mm); and large (51 – 100 mm) sublingual capillaries. The blood flow was described as no flow (0), intermittent flow (1), sluggish flow (2), and continuous flow (3). The overall flow score or microvascular flow index (MFI) was measured for quantitative assessment of microcirculation and predicting power for concurrent infection in cirrhosis.

The chemical species formed on the steps and (1 1 1) surface of PSi nanocrystallites were well distinguished in infrared bands. The amount of SiySiHx species per unit PSi thickness was found to decrease linearly with the increasing current density. The observed relationships among the electrochemical behavior, microstructure and composition are discussed, and a simplified nanocrystallite model is suggested.

40|$|Background: Dysphagia is a {{frequent}} and dangerous complication of acute stroke. Apart from a well-timed oropharyngeal muscular contraction pattern, sensory feedback is of utmost importance for safe and efficient swallowing. In the present study, we therefore analyzed the relation between pharyngolaryngeal sensory deficits and post-stroke dysphagia (PSD) severity in a cohort of acute stroke patients with middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarction. Methods: Eighty-four first-ever MCA stroke patients (41 left, 43 right) were included in this trial. In all patients, fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) was performed according to a standardized protocol within 96 h after stroke onset. PSD was classified according to the 6 -point fiberoptic endoscopic dysphagia severity scale. Pharyngolaryngeal sensation was <b>semi-quantitatively</b> <b>evaluated</b> by a FEES-based touch technique. Results: PSD severity was {{closely related to the}} pharyngolaryngeal sensory deficit. With regards to lateralization of the sensory deficit, there was a slight but significant preponderance of sensory loss contralateral to the side of stroke. Apart from that, right hemispheric stroke patients were found to present with a more severe PSD. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that an intact sensory feedback is of utmost importance to perform nonimpaired swallowing and highlights the key role of disturbed pharyngeal and laryngeal afferents in the pathophysiology of PSD...|$|R

GPC 3 is mutated in Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome, which is characterized by tissue overgrowth and {{an increased risk of}} embryonal malignancies. GPC 3 has also been implicated in sporadic cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma, for which it {{has been shown to be}} a useful diagnostic marker. Although GPC 3 expression has been studied in non-neoplastic placental tissue, its presence in gestational trophoblastic diseases has not been previously explored. The purpose of this study was to investigate the immunohistochemical expression of GPC 3 in placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT), a very rare gestational trophoblastic neoplasm which may be morphologically confused with non-trophoblastic tumors, and to assess its possible utility as a diagnostic marker. Methods: Fifteen cases of PSTT, as well as samples from placental site nodule (PSN) (n = 2), leiomyosarcoma (n = 1), leiomyoma (n = 1), invasive cervical squamous cell carcinoma (n = 7) and endometrial adenocarcinoma (n = 11) were examined.

Since these patients show reduced nephrin and podocin expression at renal biopsy, we evaluated the effect of serum and PF from patients with FSGS on nephrin and podocin expression in human podocytes. We studied 7 sera from patients with steroid-resistant FSGS, 3 from patients with nephrotic syndrome caused by non-immune disease, and 6 from healthy subjects. PF was prepared from plasmapheresis eluates of 2 patients with post-transplant recurrence of FSGS. Purification procedure was based on protein A Sepharose chromatography and differential precipitation in ammonium sulphate. Nephrin and podocin expression was <b>semi-quantitatively</b> <b>evaluated</b> by immunofluorescence. We found that serum and PF from FSGS patients rapidly induced redistribution and loss of nephrin in podocytes. This effect was associated with cytoskeleton redistribution and inhibited by cytochalasin B and sodium azide. On the contrary, podocin expression was unchanged after incubation with serum and PF from FSGS patients for short periods, but markedly reduced at 24 h. Our results demonstrate that serum and PF from FSGS patients may directly affect nephrin and podocin in human podocytes, thus providing {{new insights into the}} mechanisms causing proteinuria in FSGS...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{cleaning}} {{the surface of}} single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) networks by thermal and the O 2 plasma treatments is presented in terms of NH 3 gas sensing characteristics. The goal of this work {{is to determine the}} relationship between the physicochemical properties of the cleaned surface (including the chemical composition, crystal structure, hydrophilicity, and impurity content) and the sensitivity of the SWNT network films to NH 3 gas. The SWNT networks are spray-deposited on pre-patterned Pt electrodes, and are further functionalized by heating on a programmable hot plate or by O 2 plasma treatment in a laboratory-prepared plasma chamber. Cyclic voltammetry was employed to <b>semi-quantitatively</b> <b>evaluate</b> each surface state of various plasma-treated SWNT-based electrodes. The results show that O 2 plasma treatment can more effectively modify the SWNT network surface than thermal cleaning, and can provide a better conductive network surface due to the larger number of carbonyl/carboxyl groups, enabling a faster electron transfer rate, even though both the thermal cleaning and the O 2 plasma cleaning methods can eliminate the organic solvent residues from the network surface. The NH 3 sensors based on the O 2 plasma-treated SWNT network exhibit higher sensitivity, shorter response time, and better recovery of the initial resistance than those prepared employing the thermally-cleaned SWNT networks...|$|R

This laboratory study evaluated the results from CPC and OPC simultaneously measuring a polydisperse aerosol to assess their variability and accuracy. Methods and Results: Two CPCs and two OPCs were used to evaluate a polydisperse sodium chloride aerosol within an enclosed chamber. The measurement results for number concentration versus time were compared between paired particle monitors of the same type, and to results from the Scanning Mobility Particle Spectrometer (SMPS) which was widely used to measure concentration of size-specific particles. According to analyses by using the Bland-Altman method, the CPCs displayed a constant mean percent difference of 23. 8 % (95 % agreement limits: 29. 1 to 1. 6 %; range of 95 % agreement limit: 10. 7 %) with the chamber particle concentration below its dynamic upper limit (100, 000 particles per cubic centimeter). The mean percent difference increased from 23. 4 % to 212. 0 % (range of 95 % agreement limits: 7. 1 %) with increasing particle concentrations that were above the dynamic upper limit.

AIMS : This study aimed to examine both proteins in OSCC and their relation to clinic- pathological findings. Setting and Design: A total of 31 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens of OSCC were selected in this study. PIK 3 CB and K-ras expressions were detected using standard immunohistochemical techniques. Materials and Methods: PIK 3 CB and k-ras immune reactivity was <b>semi-quantitatively</b> <b>evaluated</b> in at least five representative fields at 400 X magnification and recorded as percentage of PIK 3 CB and k-ras positive tumor cells over {{the total number of}} cells examined in the same area. Results and Conclusion: All examined specimens of OSCC were positive for monoclonal antibodies directed against PIK 3 CB and K-ras proteins especially at advanced stage of the disease. No significant relation was observed between the tested proteins and the clinic-pathological findings of OSCC; however a highly significant direct relationship was observed between K-ras and PIK 3 CB. This lead to conclusion that both K-ras and PIK 3 CB signaling pathway were activated in the advanced stage of OSCC, and possibly a cross-talk between them. This could make these mutant proteins a potential target for an effective molecular therapy...|$|R

40|$|Fully {{validated}} numerical models {{specifically designed}} for simulating bedload transport dynamics in mountain streams are rare. In this study, the recently developed modelling tool sedFlow {{has been applied to}} simulate bedload transport in the Swiss mountain rivers Kleine Emme and Brenno. It is shown that sedFlow can be used to successfully reproduce observations from historic bedload transport events with plausible parameter set-ups, meaning that calibration parameters are only varied within ranges of uncertainty that have been pre-determined either by previous research or by field observations in the simulated study reaches. In the Brenno river, the spatial distribution of total transport volumes has been reproduced with a Nash–Sutcliffe goodness of fit of 0. 733; this relatively low value is partially due to anthropogenic extraction of sediment that was not considered. In the Kleine Emme river, the spatial distribution of total transport volumes has been reproduced with a goodness of fit of 0. 949. The simulation results shed light on the difficulties that arise with traditional flow-resistance estimation methods when macro-roughness is present. In addition, our results demonstrate that greatly simplified hydraulic routing schemes, such as kinematic wave or uniform discharge approaches, are probably sufficient for a good representation of bedload transport processes in reach-scale simulations of steep mountain streams.

Materials and Methods: A total of 39 patients with CAD was enrolled (34 men and 5 women), aged between 36 and 72 years (mean 58 ± 8 standard in years) who underwent both pre- and 3 months post-CABG myocardial SPECT. We analyzed 17 myocardial segments per patient. Perfusion status and wall motion were <b>semi-quantitatively</b> <b>evaluated</b> using a 4 -point grading system. Viable myocardium was defined as dysfunctional myocardium which showed wall motion improvement after CABG.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) {{metastasis}} {{is enhanced}} {{in patients with}} venous embolization increasing the risk of recurrence and therefore mortality rate. Several evidences indicate that stage II patients have an abrupt recurrence within five years from surgery. This fact, led us to investigate {{the role played by}} different histological variables on CRC invasiveness. AIM: To demonstrate if quantitative and qualitative desmoplastic response and lymphocytic infiltration are prognostic factor involved in the recurrence of CRC within five years from surgery, considering possible clinical and therapeutical implications. METHODS: Thirty-four patients with CRC underwent colectomy and the UICC-TNM classification was applied for disease staging. Histological variables were <b>semi-quantitatively</b> <b>evaluated.</b> Qualitative evaluation of desmoplasia was obtained with the hematoxillin-eosin method. RESULTS: Survival rate arose 88 % at stage II, at five years of follow-up, and the 12 % not treated with adjuvant chemotherapy developed metastasis. Desmoplasia is strongly associated with venous neoplastic invasiveness (OR: 21. 93; 95 %CI: 1. 012 - 475. 26, p = 0. 02), and therefore, with mortality rate (OR: 14. 33; 95 %CI: 0. 67 - 304, p = 0. 04). Moreover, mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with immature desmoplasia compare to mature stromal tissue (OR: 15. 61, 95 %CI: 0. 69 - 343. 38, p = 0. 04). CONCLUSIONS: These observations should prompt a future evaluation of desmoplasia to extent more suitably the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in II stage patients. Further clinical trials are needed to determine if these findings will be able to reduce mortality rate, in stage II CRC patients...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Cluster of {{differentiation}} (CD) 24 {{was originally}} {{described as a}} B lymphocyte marker and has recently received considerable attention in cancer research as its overexpression has been observed in several types of carcinoma. The CD 24 molecule is a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-linked cell surface protein {{that appears to be}} associated with aggressive cancers involving invasion and metastasis. However, the expression of CD 24 in human bladder cancer and its clinical signifi-cance remains largely unknown and no association has been reported between CD 24 overexpression and human bladder tumor recurrence. In the present study, the CD 24 expression in cancer tissues obtained during transurethral surgery and the subsequent intra-bladder tumor recurrence following surgery were assessed. Immunohistochemical staining was performed and the intensity of CD 24 staining was <b>semi-quantitatively</b> <b>evaluated.</b> CD 24 expression was observed more frequently in high-grade bladder tumors (G 2 -G 3) than low-grade tumors (G 1). Positive CD 24 expression was significantly associated with intra-bladder tumor recurrence following surgery and increased staining intensity was also correlated with recur-rence. The positive association between CD 24 expression and tumor recurrence was observed in each tumor category (stages Ta and T 1, low and high grade). The results demonstrated that CD 24 expression is significantly associated with bladder tumor recurrence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to reveal the significance of CD 24 as a predictor of bladder cancer recurrence.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} evidence that overexpression of cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX- 2) {{plays an important}} role in tumour growth and spread of tumours by interfering with cell proliferation, cellular adhesion, immune surveillance, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. COX- 2 levels are increased in various tumours. In this study, the expression of COX- 2 in 116 specimens of keratocystic odontogenic tumours (KCOT) has been analyzed. KCOT is a benign neoplasm of odontogenic origin with an occasionally aggressive behavior leading to high recurrence rates. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks were sectioned and used for hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and incubated with an anti-COX- 2 monoclonal antibody for immunohistochemical examination. Detection of the COX- 2 antibody was performed with the EnVision kit. Cellular staining pattern for COX- 2 was cytoplasmatic, and the staining intensities were <b>semi-quantitatively</b> <b>evaluated</b> as follows: negative (-), mild (±) or strong (+). Mild to strong expression of COX- 2 was observed in 83 (71. 6 %) cases; 34 (29. 3 %) of which were mild positive and 49 (42. 2 %) were strong positive. COX- 2 stain was detected mainly in the epithelial lining. The expression of COX- 2 in KCOT and the current knowledge of the role played by COX- 2 in tumorigenesis further strengthen the current concept that the KCOT should be regarded as a neoplasm. Furthermore, the multitude of markers known to be overexpressed in KCOTs is suggestive of what could be called a 'network addiction' pattern, rather than a pathological mechanism dependant on a specific activated/suppressed gene, thus explaining its aggressive behavior...|$|R

The clay mineral assemblage of the Taiwan-sourced sediments consists dominantly of illite (average 56 %) and chlorite (41 %), with very scarce kaolinite and smectite. Their respective distribution from the rivers and lakes to the seafloor off Taiwan does not show obvious basin-wide differences. Linear correlations of illite chemistry index with illite crystallinity and of illite crystallinity with kaolinite (%) present two end-members of provenances, the Pearl River and Taiwan, for the South China shelf and slope. Assuming that kaolinite in the northern SCS is provided completely from the Pearl River, the contribution of Taiwan in clay minerals is evaluated as 29 % to the South China shelf and 23 % to the South China slope, respectively. Accordingly, {{the contribution of the}} Pearl River to the South China shelf and slope is 52 % and 31 %, respectively. The Luzon Arc accounts for the rest of clay mineral components for the northern SCS mainly by providing smectite.

Conclusion: Adrenal scintigraphy using nor-chol and MR are both able to accurately identify cortical adenomas; however, while semi-quantitative analysis of nor-chol uptake is effective to differentiate between hypersecreting and non-hypersecreting adenomas, SIRs evaluation is not useful for this purpose; in particular, the lower nor-chol uptake observed in non-hypersecreting adenomas might reflect the normal hormone synthesis status of these lesions and, thus, regular secretion; this finding could also reflect initial adrenal dysfunction responsible of sub-clinical disorders...|$|R
40|$|Background: Primary biliary {{cirrhosis}} (PBC) is an autoimmune {{liver disease}} targeting the intrahepatic small bile ducts showing chronic non-suppurative destructive cholangitis (CNSDC). Recent {{studies suggest that}} naturally-occurring CD 4 +CD 25 high regulatory T cells (Tregs) expressing Forkhead box P 3 (Foxp 3) {{play an active role}} in immunological self-tolerance. Aims: To investigate whether Foxp 3 +Tregs are involved in the pathogenesis of PBC. Methods: Foxp 3 +Tregs was detected immunohistochemically in livers from patients with PBC (n = 27), chronic viral hepatitis (CVH) (n = 15), and normal subjects (n = 10). The distribution of Tregs in portal tracts was <b>semi-quantitatively</b> <b>evaluated</b> in each groups. Levels of Foxp 3, IL- 10, TGFβ, IFNγ and TNFα mRNA was evaluated in PBC (n= 15) and control livers (n = 21) using semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. Results: In PBC and CVH livers, the amounts of infiltrating Foxp 3 +Tregs in portal tracts were in parallel with the degree of portal inflammation irrespective of disease. The infiltration of Foxp 3 +Tregs into portal tracts with CNSDC in PBC was foremost in comparison with inflamed portal tracts in CVH or those without CNSDC in PBC (p< 0. 05). Focally, Tregs infiltrated into the biliary epithelial layer at the site of CNSDC. The level of Foxp 3, IL- 10 and TGFβ mRNA expression was high in PBC compared with normal livers (p< 0. 05). IFNγ and TNFα mRNA was high in early PBC and CVH livers. Conclusion: Results of this evaluation of Foxp 3 +Tregs do not suggest that the reduced regulatory function accounts for the development of CNSDC in PBC...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Carcinogenic exocyclic-DNA adducts like 1,N(6) -etheno- 2 '-deoxyadenosine (εdA) {{are formed}} through {{reactive}} intermediates of 4 -hydroxynonenal (4 -HNE) or other lipid peroxidation (LPO) products with the DNA bases A, C, methyl-C and G. High levels of hepatic etheno-DNA adducts {{have been detected}} in cancer prone liver diseases including alcoholic liver disease (ALD). In ALD εdA levels correlated significantly with cytochrome P- 450 2 E 1 (CYP 2 E 1) expression which is also induced in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We investigated the occurrence of εdA adducts in children with NASH as a DNA damage marker. METHODS: Liver biopsies from 21 children/adolescents with histologically proven NASH were analysed for hepatic fat content, inflammation, and fibrosis. εdA levels in DNA, CYP 2 E 1 -expression and protein bound 4 -hydroxynonenal (HNE) were <b>semi-quantitatively</b> <b>evaluated</b> by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Among 21 NASH children, εdA levels in the liver were high in 3, moderate in 5, weak in 9 and not elevated in 4 patients. There was {{a positive correlation between}} CYP 2 E 1 and protein-bound 4 -HNE (r= 0. 60; P= 0. 008) and a trend for a positive relationship for CYP 2 E 1 vs. staining intensity of εdA (r= 0. 45; P= 0. 06). Inflammatory activity and fibrosis correlated significantly (r= 0. 49, P= 0. 023). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate {{for the first time the}} presence of elevated carcinogenic etheno-DNA lesions (εdA) in the majority (17 / 21) of liver biopsies from young NASH patients. Our data suggest that LPO-derived etheno-adducts are implicated in NASH. Whether these adducts may serve as predictive risk markers in NASH children to develop hepatocellular cancer later in life remains to be investigated...|$|R
40|$|Gentamicin is the {{preferred}} antimicrobial agent used in implant coating {{for the prevention of}} implant-related infections (IRI). However, the present heavy local and systemic administration of gentamicin can lead to increased resistance, which has made its future use uncertain, together with related preventive technologies. Fosfomycin is an alternative antimicrobial agent that lacks the cross-resistance presented by other classes of antibiotics. We evaluated the efficacy of prophylaxis of 10 % fosfomycin-containing poly(D,L-lactide) (PDL) coated K-wires in a rat IRI model and compared it with uncoated (Control 1), PDL-coated (Control 2), and 10 % gentamicin-containing PDL-coated groups with a single layer of coating. Stainless steel K-wires were implanted and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 43300) suspensions (103 CFU/ 10 μl) were injected into a cavity in the left tibiae. Thereafter, K-wires were removed and cultured in tryptic soy broth and then 5 % sheep blood agar mediums. Sliced sections were removed from the tibiae, stained with hematoxylin-eosin, and <b>semi-quantitatively</b> <b>evaluated</b> with X-rays. The addition of fosfomycin into PDL did not affect the X-ray and histopathological evaluation scores; however, the addition of gentamicin lowered them. The addition of gentamicin showed a protective effect after the 28 th day of X-ray evaluations. PDL-only coating provided no protection, while adding fosfomycin to PDL offered a 20 % level protection and adding gentamicin offered 80 %. Furthermore, there were 103 CFU level growths in the gentamicin-added group, while the other groups had 105. Thus, the addition of fosfomycin to PDL does not affect the efficacy of prophylaxis, but the addition of gentamicin does. We therefore do not advise the use of fosfomycin as a single antimicrobial agent in coating for IRI prophylaxis...|$|R
40|$|Hepatic stellate {{cells have}} been {{considered}} the most important cell-type involved in hepatic fibrogenesis. Proliferation and differentiation of hepatic stellate cells into myofibroblast-like cells has been related {{to the development of}} liver fibrosis. The alpha-actin expressed by hepatic stellate cells was considered a marker of their activation to myofibroblast-like cell. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the changes in morphology, distribution, percentage and alpha-smooth muscle actin expression of hepatic stellate cells in normal and cirrhotic livers, and to correlate activated hepatic stellate cells with the progression of fibrosis. Human liver biopsies (n= 121) were divided in five groups: 1) normal livers (controls); 2) cirrhosis post-HCV hepatitis; 3) cirrhosis post-HBV hepatitis; 4) non viral related cirrhosis; 5) recurrent HCV hepatitis after orthotopic liver transplantation. Samples immunostained with anti alpha-smooth muscle actin antibody by immunoperoxidase method were <b>semi-quantitatively</b> <b>evaluated.</b> Liver fibrosis was quantified by computer image analysis on specimens stained with Masson's trichrome. In normal adult livers stellate cells were very rarely stained for alpha-smooth muscle actin. In cirrhotic livers, a strongly enhanced percentage of stellate cells expressing alpha-smooth muscle actin was detected in cirrhotic fragments with respect to the control group, with a significant correlation between alpha-smooth muscle actin positive stellate cells and the volume fraction of fibrosis. Moreover, liver biopsies of recurrent hepatitis revealed an increased number of activated stellate cells compared to normal livers, and intermediate volume fraction of fibrosis. These results confirmed that a direct correlation existed between activated stellate cells and the progression of fibrosis. Alpha-smooth muscle actin confirmed to be a reliable marker of hepatic stellate cells activation also in precocious stages of the disease...|$|R
40|$|There are {{few studies}} on the {{relationship}} between the morphology of acute tubular necrosis (ATN) in native kidneys and late functional recovery. Eighteen patients with acute renal failure (ARF) who had undergone renal biopsy were studied. All had the histological diagnosis of ATN and were followed for at least six months. Clinical characteristics of ARF were analyzed, and histological features were <b>semi-quantitatively</b> <b>evaluated</b> (tubular atrophy, interstitial inflammatory infiltrate, interstitial fibrosis, and ATN). According to the maximal GFR achieved during the follow-up, patients were divided into two groups: complete recovery (GFR >= 90 mL/min/ 1. 73 m(2)) and partial recovery (GFR < 90 mL/min/ 1. 73 m(2)). Only 39 % of the patients achieved complete recovery. Patients with partial recovery achieved their maximal GFR (63 +/- 9 mL/min/ 1. 73 m(2)) 37 +/- 14 months after ARF, a period of time similar to those patients with complete recovery (i. e., 54 +/- 22 months). Patients with partial recovery had more severe ARF: oliguria was more frequent (90 versus 17 %, p < 0. 01), and they had higher peak creatinine (13. 85 +/- 1. 12 versus 8. 95 +/- 1. 30 mg/dL, p = 0. 01), and longer hospitalization (45 +/- 7 versus 20 +/- 4 days, p = 0. 03). No single histological parameter was associated with partial recovery, but the sum of all was when expressed as an injury index [4. 00 (2. 73 - 5. 45) versus 2. 00 (1. 25 - 3. 31), p < 0. 05]. In conclusion, among patients with atypical ATN course, those with more severe ARF and tubule-interstitial lesions are more prone to partial recovery...|$|R
40|$|Temporal {{and spatial}} {{molecular}} imaging of disease biomarkers using non-invasive MRI with high resolution is largely limited {{by lack of}} MRI contrast agents with high sensitivity, high specificity, optimized biodistribution and pharmacokinetics. In this dissertation, I report my Ph. D. work {{on the development of}} protein-based MRI contrast agents (ProCAs) specifically targeting different cancer biomarkers, such as grastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRPR), prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor- 2 (VEGFR- 2). Similar to non-targeted ProCAs, these biomarker-targeted ProCAs exhibit 5 - 10 times higher r 1 and r 2 relaxivites than that of clinical MRI contrast agents. In addition, these biomarker-targeted ProCAs have high Gd 3 + binding affinities and metal selectivities. The highest binding affinity of the three GRPR-targeted contrast reagents obtained by grafting a GRPR ligand binding moiety into ProCA 32 for GRPR is 2. 7 x 10 - 9 M. We further demonstrate that GRPR-targeted ProCAs were able to <b>semi-quantitatively</b> <b>evaluate</b> GRPR expression levels in xenograft mice model by MRI. In addition, we have also created a PSMA-targeted ProCA which has a binding affinity to PSMA biomarker of 5. 2 x 10 - 7 M. Further, we developed VEGFR-targeted contrast agent which is able to image VEGFR 2 in mice models using T 1 -weighted and T 2 -weighted sequences. Moreover, the relaxivities and coordination water numbers of ProCAs can be tuned by protein design of ProCA 4. Since disease biomarkers are expressed in various tumors and diseases, our results may have strong preclinical and clinical implications for the diagnosis and therapeutics of cancer and other type of diseases...|$|R

40|$|Arsenic sulfide (AsxSy) {{nanowires}} were synthesized by an evaporation-condensation {{process in}} evacuated fused quartz ampoules. During the deposition process, a thin, colored film of AsxSy was deposited along the upper, cooler {{portion of the}} ampoule. The ampoule was sectioned and the deposited film analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to characterize and <b>semi-quantitatively</b> <b>evaluate</b> the microstructural features of the deposited film. A variety of microstructures were observed that ranged from a continuous thin film (warmer portion of the ampoule), to isolated micron- and nano-scale droplets (in the intermediate portion), as well as nanowires (colder portion of the ampoule). Experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of ampoule cleaning methods (e. g. modify surface chemistry) and quantity of source material on nanowire formation. The evolution of these microstructures in the thin film {{was determined to be}} a function of initial pressure, substrate temperature, substrate surface treatment, and initial volume of As 2 S 3 glass. In a set of two experiments where the initial pressure, substrate thermal gradient, and surface treatment were the same, the initial quantity of As 2 S 3 glass per internal ampoule volume was doubled from one test to the other. The results showed that AsxSy nanowires were only formed in the test with the greater initial quantity of As 2 S 3 per internal ampoule volume. The growth data for variation in diameter (e. g. nanowire or droplet) as a function of substrate temperature was fit to an exponential trendline with the form y = Aekx, where y is the structure diameter, A = 1. 25 × 10 - 3, k = 3. 96 × 10 - 2, and x is the temperature with correlation coefficient, R 2 = 0. 979, indicating a thermally-activated process...|$|R
40|$|Given the {{significant}} initial investment and long {{life span of}} road-stream crossing structures, interest has grown in developing tools to evaluate their physical and biological effectiveness. In this case, the physical effectiveness monitoring guidelines being developed consist of two protocols; Level 2 is a detailed, statistically-based survey and evaluation of a suite of physical habitat metrics, while Level 1 is a simplified subset of that. Our premise for both monitoring protocols {{is that if the}} design channel characteristics through the crossing are similar to a nearby representative reach of the natural channel, then the design channel is considered to be effectively providing geomorphic, hydrologic, and ecological continuity that ultimately benefit fish and other aquatic organism passage. The level 1 physical monitoring protocol was purposefully designed to be simple and quick, so that users could <b>semi-quantitatively</b> <b>evaluate</b> the effectiveness of road-stream crossing channel designs at a large number of sites. Relatively few measurements are required, but they provide a consistent framework for evaluating, documenting, and reporting {{the degree to which the}} road-stream crossing design channel, including the inlet and outlet transitions, match the physical characteristics of the adjacent natural channel. Physical channel characteristics of interest include bank full and wetted widths, maximum depths, bed-materials sizes, and stream bank irregularity and continuity. Median values for each physical measurement are compared with the range observed in the adjacent natural channel. The results of the individual metrics are weighted and integrated in a summary rubric to develop an overall rating for physical effectiveness. The Level 1 protocol is intended to provide a quick assessment of effectiveness for a large number of sites, which means that limited information is available to critique the site’s design and construction, compared to the Level 2 protocol...|$|R
