40|$|Water {{reservoirs}} {{are increasingly}} {{recognized as a}} significant anthropogenic source of methane (CH 4) production and emissions, CH 4 being the second most prevalent greenhouse gas (GHG) after CO 2. The dominant emission pathway for CH 4 in lacustrine environments is ebullition (bubbling). A survey of current ebullition measurement methods reveals a technology gap; the ability to measure ebullition rates and CH 4 content simultaneously and affordably with high temporal and spatial resolution is not currently available. Characterizing and modeling methane ebullition in water reservoirs is key to quantifying lacustrine methane emissions and providing a basis for potential mitigation efforts.
