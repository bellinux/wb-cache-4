40|$|Experimental {{results on}} the phase slip process in superconducting lead {{nanowires}} are presented under two different experimental conditions: constant applied current or constant voltage. Based on these experiments we established a simple model which gives us {{the condition of the}} appearance of phase slip centers in a quasi-one-dimensional wire. It turns out that the competition between two relaxations times (relaxation time of the absolute value of the order parameter τ_|ψ| and relaxation time of the phase of the order parameter in the phase <b>slip</b> <b>center</b> τ_ϕ) governs the phase slip process. Phase slip phenomena, as periodic oscillations in time of the order parameter, is possible only if the gradient of the phase grows faster than the value of the order parameter in the phase <b>slip</b> <b>center,</b> or equivalently if τ_ϕ<τ_|ψ|.

In the case of a p^th order phase transition to a superconducting ground state, the free energy density depends on temperature as a^p, where a = a_o(1 -T/T_c) is the reduced temperature. The energy of a domain wall between two degenerate ground states is ϵ_p ≃ a^p- 1 / 2. We have also investigated the effects of a supercurrent in a narrow wire. These effects are limited by a critical current which has a temperature dependence J_c(T) ≃ a^(2 p- 1) / 2. The phase <b>slip</b> <b>center</b> profiles and their energies are also calculated.

40|$|A {{theory is}} offered for the {{ballistic}} 4 -terminal Josephson junction. The studied system {{consists of a}} mesoscopic two-dimensional normal rectangular layer which is attached in each side to the bulk superconducting banks (terminals). The relation between the currents through the different terminals, which is valid for arbitrary temperatures and junction sizes, is obtained. The nonlocal coupling of the supercurrents leads to a new effect, specific for the mesoscopic weak link between two superconducting rings; an applied magnetic flux {{through one of the}} rings produces a magnetic flux in the other ring {{even in the absence of}} an external flux through the other one. The phase dependent distributions of the local density of Andreev states, of the supercurrents and of the induced order parameter are obtained. The "interference pattern" for the anomalous average inside the two dimensional region can be regulated by the applied magnetic fluxes or the transport currents.

40|$|Electrical {{transport}} {{measurements were}} made on single-crystal Sn nanowires to understand the intrinsic dissipation mechanisms of a one-dimensional superconductor. While the resistance of wires of diameter larger than 70 nm drops precipitately to zero at Tc near 3. 7 K, a residual resistive tail extending down to low temperature is found for wires with diameters of 20 and 40 nm. As a function of temperature, the logarithm of the residual resistance appears as two linear sections, one within a few tenths of a degree below Tc and the other extending down to at least 0. 47 K, the minimum temperature of the measurements. The residual resistance {{is found to be}} ohmic at all temperatures below Tc of Sn. These findings are suggestive of a thermally activated phase slip process near Tc and quantum fluctuation-induced phase slip process in the low temperature regime. When the excitation current exceeds a critical value, the voltage-current (V-I) curves show a series of discrete steps in approaching the normal state. These steps cannot be fully understood with the classical Skocpol-Beasley-Tinkham phase <b>slip</b> <b>center</b> model (PSC), but can be qualitatively accounted for partly by the PSC model modified by Michotte et al.

Details are given of experiments to measure charge imbalance and the charge relaxation rate when inelastic scattering is the predominant relaxation mechanism. Experiments on and theories of other charge relaxation mechanisms are discussed, namely relaxation via elastic scattering in the presence of energy gap anisotropy, or in the presence of a pair breaking mechanism such as magnetic impurities or an applied supercurrent or magnetic field.

40|$|Recently {{transport}} measurements {{have been}} carried out in resistively shunted long superconducting nanowires [M. W. Brenner et. al., Phys. Rev. B 85, 224507 (2012) ]. The measured voltage-current (V-I) characteristics was explained by the appearance of the phase <b>slip</b> <b>centers</b> in the shunted wire, and the whole wire was modeled as a single Josephson junction. The kinetic inductance of the long nanowires used in experiments is generally large. Here we argue that the shunted superconducting nanowire acts as a Josephson junction in series with an inductor. The inductance depends on the length and the cross section of the wire. The inclusion of inductance in our analysis modifies the V-I curves, and increases the rate of switching from the superconducting state to the resistive state. The quantitative differences can be quite large in some practical parameter sets, and might be important to properly understand the experimental results. Our proposed model can be verified experimentally by studying the shunted superconducting nanowires of different lengths and cross sections. Comment: 7 pages and 6 figure...|$|R

40|$|We study current-voltage (V-I) {{characteristics}} of short superconducting nanowires of length ~ 100 nm exposed to microwave radiation of frequencies between 100 MHz and 15 GHz. The radiation causes {{a decrease of}} the average switching current of the wire. This suppression of the switching current is modeled assuming that there is one-to-one correspondence between Little's phase slips and the experimentally observed switching events. At some critical power P* of the radiation a dissipative dynamic superconducting state occurs as an extra step on the V-I curve. It is identified as a phase <b>slip</b> <b>center</b> (PSC). With the dependence of the switching currents and the standard deviations observed at the transitions (i) from a constant supercurrent state to a normal state and (ii) from a constant superconducting state to a PSC state, we conclude that both of {{the two types of}} the switching events are triggered by the same microscopic event, namely a single Little's phase slip. We show that the Skocpol-Beasely-Tinkham model is not applicable to our microwave-driven phase slip centers, since it leads to an unphysical small estimated value {{of the size of the}} dissipative core of the PSC. Through the analysis of the witching current distributions at a sufficiently low temperature, we also present evidence that the quantum phase slip play a role in switching events under microwaves.

We show that changing $u$ dramatically affects both the behaviour of the current-voltage characteristics of the superconducting channels and {{the dynamics of the}}ir order parameter. Previously, it was demonstrated that when $u$ is less than the critical value $u_{c 1 }$, which does not depend on $L$, the phase <b>slip</b> <b>centers</b> appear simultaneously at different spots of the channel. Herewith, for $u>u_{c 1 }$ these centres arise consecutively at the same place. In our work we demonstrate that there is another critical value for $u$. Actually, if $u$ does not exceed a certain value $u_{c 2 }$, which depends on $L$, the current-voltage characteristic exhibits the step-like behaviour. However, for $u>u_{c 2 }$ it becomes hysteretic. In this case, with increase of $j$ the steady state, which corresponds to the time independent distribution of the order parameter along the channel, losses its stability at switching current value $j_{sw}$, and time periodic oscillations of both the order parameter and electric filed occur in the channel. As $j$ sweeps down, the periodic dynamics ceases at certain retrapping current value $j_r<j_{sw}$. Shunting the channel by a resistor increases the value of $j_r$, while $j_{sw}$ remains unchanged. Thus, for some high enough conductivity of the shunt $j_r$ and $j_{sw}$ eventually coincide, and the hysteretic loop disappears.

40|$|Abstract. We {{examine the}} {{behavior}} of a one-dimensional superconducting wire exposed to an applied electric current. We use the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model to describe the system and retain temperature and applied current as parameters. Through a combination of spectral analysis, asymptotics and canonical numerical computation, we divide this two-dimensional parameter space into a number of regions. In some of them only the normal state or a stationary state or an oscillatory state are stable, while in some of them two states are stable. One of the most interesting features of the analysis is the evident collision of real eigenvalues of the associated PT-symmetric linearization, leading as it does to the emergence of complex elements of the spectrum. In particular this provides an explanation to the emergence of a stable oscillatory state. We show that part of the bifurcation diagram and many of the emerging patterns are directly controlled by this spectrum, while other patterns arise due to nonlinear interaction of the leading eigenfunctions.

An electric current is fed into the wire at one of its ends creating a voltage difference across the wire.

Experimental results show that, depending on the interruption temperature, two secondary precipitation strengthening regimes exist during re-ageing: below 50 degrees C displaying almost no influence on the peak hardness of the alloy, and above 50 degrees C where a significant increase in hardness is observed. This behavior is modeled using the Kampmann-Wagner numerical (KWN) method. The developed age-hardening model is then combined with the Kocks-Mecking work-hardening model. The results indicate that although secondary precipitation above 50 degrees C could improve the yield strength, hardly does it have any effect on the work hardening behavior of the alloy. The experimental results show that the main effect of secondary precipitates is on the post-necking regime, where the higher volume fraction of secondary precipitates increases the strain after necking.
