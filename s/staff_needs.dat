50|$|The {{cost will}} also {{depend on the}} {{seniority}} of staff undertaking the work. Planning of the model audit, as for a statutory audit, is vital to mitigating risk, and thus {{this needs to be}} undertaken by senior staff. In planning, the elements of the model audit should be allocated to staff with the appropriate level of experience, technical expertise (e.g. tax or accounting) and seniority. The senior <b>staff</b> <b>needs</b> to {{look at the big picture}} of the model to ensure that it makes sense as a whole.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two basic}} approaches. The first is to re-read a proof within its {{deadline}} and in the department itself.

This approach can also be followed {{as a matter of}} routine. The goal then is not to confirm a specific suspicion of poor job performance by a particular reader, but rather to confirm a general assumption that the proofreading <b>staff</b> <b>needs</b> ongoing monitoring.|$|E

In August 1955, the House of Representatives {{called on}} the Council of Ministers to present proposals towards the Nigerianisation of the civil service. In March 1956, the council presented before the House, Sessional Paper No.4 of 1956, a statement policy on Nigerianisation. The council proposed that a new position, the Office of the Nigerianisation Officer be created and increased level of post-secondary school training of Nigerians so as {{to meet the needs}} of the public service. To ensure the success of the proposals three training programmes were to be instituted. Senior Training, Intermediate Training and Preliminary Training. [...] Three major governmental bodies where charged with implementing the process: the Public Service Commission, Scholarship Board and the establishment office.Each ministry was mandated to keep tabs on departmental needs and Nigerians in training who could fit the <b>staff</b> <b>needs.</b> The process also involved recruitment of Nigerian students in U.K. for administrative positions at home. While the number of Nigerians in senior positions was 786 out of a total of 5,125, in 1961 the figure had increased to 3,030 out of a total of 5,133. By 1965, the process of Nigerianisation had virtually been completed in the Federal Service and at the regional levels.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The {{increase}} {{of the quality of}} service requires human resource with good quality and quantity. In health service, nursing <b>staff</b> <b>need</b> can be calculated by using many methods, such as Gillies method, ratio method, nursing workshop method, Thailand and Philippine method, Nina method, and Douglas method. Besides those six methods, nursing <b>staff</b> <b>need</b> can be calculated by calculating worktime and workload. This method is called Time and Motion Study. Douglas method is used to calculate nursing <b>staff</b> <b>need</b> at IRNA Bedah A Dr. Soetomo Hospital. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the calculation of nursing <b>staff</b> <b>need</b> using Douglas method and Time and Motion Study. Method: This study used  descriptive design with observational approach. Samples, taken by total sampling, were 12 nurses at IRNA Bedah A Dr. Soetomo hospital for Time and Motion Study and all patients at IRNA Bedah A. Data for Douglas method were collected by using classification of  patient’s dependence into 3 categories, i. e; self care, partial care, and total care. Data for Time and Motion Study were collected by using observation of nurse’s activities and calculate nurse’s worktime and nurse’s workload. The results showed that according to Douglas method, IRNA Bedah A needed 16 nurses, and according to Time and Motion Study, IRNA Bedah A needed 14 nurses. The mean of patient’s dependence in one week was 13 patients with self care, 3 patients with partial care, and 4 patients with total care. Result: Total productive time of the nurses at IRNA Bedah A was 3. 83 hours in the morning, 2. 37 hours in the afternoon, and 5. 25 hours at night. Nurse’s workload at IRNA Bedah A was 34. 62 %. Analysis: It can be concluded that calculation by using method Douglas shows that IRNA Bedah A needs more nurses compared with calculation by using Time and Motion Study. Discussion: Time and Motion Study is more effective than Douglas method to calculate nursing <b>staff</b> <b>need.</b> Most patients at IRNA Bedah A is self care. Most nurse’s activity at IRNA Bedah A is non-productive activity. Most of the nurse’s activities at IRNA Bedah A have done based on the standard of procedure. Nurse’s workload at IRNA Bedah A is underload...|$|R

30|$|It is {{in general}} {{difficult}} to discern precautionary costs, meaning the costs that arise due to potential delays, from other costs. In our case, the additional <b>staff</b> <b>needed</b> to manage delays should {{be independent of}} the choice of transport mode. However, combining different modes or adding new modes to an existing logistic system necessitates additional staff due to coordination issues, regardless of the variability of transport times. Thus {{it is important to}} separate costs due to the logistic system from costs due to transportation time variability. In this case, we were careful to ask for the number of additional <b>staff</b> <b>needed</b> to handle trains if rail has the same reliability as road transport. Our calculations are based on COOP’s cost allocations.|$|R
40|$|The {{difficulty}} of ensuring an adequate and appropriate distribution of health services, together with increasing financial pressures {{in the public}} sector, are forcing many countries to consider using more rigorous methods for determining staffing levels in the health facilities. The Workload Indicators of <b>Staffing</b> <b>Need</b> (WISN) method is one such method. It uses a form of activity analysis (activity standards), together with measures of utilisation and workload to determine staffing requirements. The method provides a vehicle for assessing localised <b>staffing</b> <b>needs</b> that is believable and which {{at the same time}} is sharply different to historic methods. This paper describes experiences in applying this method in hospitals in Turkey. lth manpower is to be optimized. Other issues related to autonomy are also discussed in varying detail...|$|R
