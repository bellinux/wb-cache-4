As such, two prototype aircraft, designated XB-70A, were built; these aircraft were used for supersonic test-flights during 1964–69. In 1966, one prototype crashed after colliding with a smaller aircraft while flying in close formation; the remaining Valkyrie bomber is in the National Museum of the United States Air Force near Dayton, Ohio.|$|E
5|$|In February 1936 Pontecorvo left Italy {{and moved}} to Paris {{to work in the}} {{laboratory}} of Irène and Frédéric Joliot-Curie at the Collège de France on a one-year scholarship to <b>study</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> collisions of neutrons with protons and on the electromagnetic transitions among isomers. During this period, influenced by his cousin, Emilio Sereni, he adopted the ideals of communism to which he remained loyal {{for the rest of his}} life. He formed a relationship with Helene Marianne Nordblom, a Swedish woman working in Paris as a nanny. Whether because of his relationship with Marianne, his interesting work on isomers, or the deteriorating political situation in Italy, he turned down an opportunity in 1937 to apply for a tenured position at the University of Rome to stay in Paris.|$|E
5|$|In {{another of}} her studies, Morgan worked with a fox breeder to <b>study</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> diets that {{contained}} low and normal amounts of B vitamins. The experimental group (the vitamin-restricted foxes) developed a fine, sparse gray coat that resembled the fashionable fur of the silver fox. Morgan found that the foxes with normal intake of B vitamins had shiny black fur. After the experiments, a fur stole was made out of fur from both the experimental and control groups. Morgan wore the stole {{on at least two}} important occasions – her presentation of the study data in 1939 and her Garvan Medal award ceremony ten years later.|$|E

5|$|In season one, Lex hires Roger Nixon (Tom O'Brien), a {{reporter}} for the tabloid newspaper The Inquisitor, to discover how he survived the automobile accident where Clark saved him from drowning. All the evidence points to Clark having been hit by Lex's car, but Lex refuses to believe that is what happened so Nixon attempts to expose Clark to everyone. Around the same time, Lex also enlists the help of Dr. Hamilton (Joe Morton); Hamilton is commissioned to <b>study</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> the meteor rocks. Hamilton finds an octagonal disc, with unknown symbols imprinted on the disc's surface that match those on Clark's ship, while searching for traces of an alien ship that landed in Smallville in 1989. The disc is eventually stolen by Nixon in an attempt to open Clark's ship.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{generally}} accepted maximum level of wind penetration. The limit {{for a particular}} grid {{will depend on the}} existing generating plants, pricing mechanisms, capacity for energy storage, demand management and other factors. An interconnected electric power grid will already include reserve generating and transmission capacity to allow for equipment failures. This reserve capacity can also serve to compensate for the varying power generation produced by wind stations. Studies have indicated that 20% of the total annual electrical energy consumption may be incorporated with minimal difficulty. These studies have been for locations with geographically dispersed wind farms, some degree of dispatchable energy or hydropower with storage capacity, demand management, and interconnected to a large grid area enabling the export of electric power when needed. Beyond the 20% level, there are few technical limits, but the economic implications become more significant. Electrical utilities continue to <b>study</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> large scale penetration of wind generation on system stability and economics.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, the U.S. Department of the Army {{contracted}} the botanist and bioethicist Arthur Galston, {{who discovered the}} defoliants later used in Agent Orange, and his employer University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana to <b>study</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T on cereal grains (including rice) and broadleaf crops. Galston, then {{a graduate student at}} the University of Illinois, in his research and 1943 Ph.D. dissertation focused on finding a chemical means to make soybeans flower and fruit earlier. He discovered both that 2,3,5-triiodobenzoic acid (TIBA) would speed up the flowering of soybeans and that in higher concentrations it would defoliate the soybeans. From these studies arose the concept of using aerial applications of herbicides to destroy enemy crops to disrupt their food supply. In early 1945, the U.S. Army ran tests of various 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T mixtures at the Bushnell Army Airfield in Florida. As a result, the U.S. began a full-scale production of 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T and would have used it against Japan in 1946 during Operation Downfall if the war had continued.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, a Massey University {{study in}} New Zealand {{concluded}} that sailors from the Royal Navy, Royal New Zealand Navy and Fijian Navy who observed the tests from nearby ships later suffered {{adverse health effects}} from exposure to radioactive fallout, including cancer and genetic abnormalities in the veterans' children. Various veterans' organisations filed a class action lawsuit against the UK Ministry of Defence following {{the publication of the}} <b>study.</b> <b>The</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> radioactive fallout from the Grapple tests were researched by a 2010 British Government study that concluded the fallout did not reach concentrations that could affect the surrounding nature. The Ministry of Defence maintained that few people were exposed to any radiation or contamination at all, and that studies had shown little or no health effects. An analysis of illnesses in veterans of Grapple and other weapons tests produced statistics that are hard to interpret. The veterans showed rates of illness that were slightly higher than the control group, but the control group had lower rates of illness than the population as a whole while the veterans had rates that were about the same. Neither of these results has a clear explanation.|$|E

The ion solution can be varied and drugs can be delivered through the micropipette to <b>study</b> <b>the</b> <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> current under various conditions.
