40|$|A {{model of}} soil water {{dynamics}} (SWATRE) {{and of the}} soil-plant-atmosphere continuum (SPAC), including the plant water-retention component, were applied independently to describe the seasonal and diurnal water balance of a forest in Italy. The stand under consideration was a 26 -year-old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) plantation with a density of 2044 trees ha− 1 and average height of 14. 2 m, located in the Apennines in Central Italy, 900 m a. s. l, in a mediterranean climate. Soil water potential was measured with tensiometers and psychrometers 2 or 3 times per week {{during the summer of}} 1985. The xylem water potential and leaf stomatal conductance were measured on 4 days in the period June–September 1985, at about 2 – 3 h intervals from sunrise to sunset. Global and net solar radiation, air temperature and air relative humidity above the canopy were measured. Soil water potentials simulated by the SWATRE model agreed well with the field measurements. The diurnal pattern of bulk stomatal resistance and xylem water potential simulated by the SPAC model also agreed with measurements. The results show that Douglas-fir is surprisingly well adapted to the drought conditions that occurred in Tuscany during the dry year 1985, and even with dry soil, <b>shallow</b> <b>rooting</b> <b>depth</b> and high evaporative demand, trees did not show evident water stress...|$|E
30|$|In New Zealand, shallow {{landslides}} on typically {{steep slopes}} underlain by Tertiary-aged bedrock are generally ≤[*] 1  m deep (Marden et al. 1991; Page et al. 1994) so roots must cross the basal shear plane {{in order to}} anchor the soil into more stable substrate and stabilise a slope against the initiation of shallow landslides (Wu et al. 1979). This study shows that, {{for most of the}} tree species examined, the root systems are concentrated predominantly in the upper soil profile with mean maximum root depths by year 5 ranging between 0.3 and 0.4  m. Furthermore, at this stage of their development, {{there was no significant difference}} in this metric among individual conifer species, between conifer and broadleaved species or between plate-rooted and tap-rooted species. The results also indicate that there is a rapid decline in roots with increasing depth and distance from the stem, that there are interspecies differences in root distribution and that each species allocates differing proportions of their total biomass to roots at different stages of growth, a finding similar to other local (Watson et al. 1995, 1999) and international (Abernethy and Rutherfurd 2001; Easson and Yarbrough 2002) studies on plant root distribution. This, together with the few published reports on the root depth of some of New Zealand’s tallest native conifer and hardwood forest species (Cameron 1963), with the exception of Agathis australis, indicate that the rooting depth of mature trees rarely exceeded 2 – 3  m. By implication, their comparatively <b>shallow</b> <b>rooting</b> <b>depth</b> will likely be a limiting factor in their ability to contribute to deep-soil reinforcement. Similarly, the ability of widely spaced plantings to prevent the occurrence of shallow landslide diminishes as root distribution decreases with increasing distance from the root bole.|$|E
40|$|Siliceous {{sedimentary}} formations underlie much of Cambodia, consequently {{there is}} a propensity for sandy surface soils. Only the soils fringing the Tonle Sap lake, those of the alluvial plains along the major rivers (especially the Mekong), and soils developed on basalt deviate from the characteristic of sandy soils. Substantial areas of sandy, high permeability soils are used for lowland rainfed rice production. Due to their inherent high hydraulic conductivities, standing water in rice fields of the deep sandy soils drains rapidly after rainfall predisposing rice crops to drought and high rates of nutrient leaching. However, loss of soil water saturation may limit rice yield by inhibiting nutrient uptake more often than drought, per se. Prospects for growing field crops in sandy lowland soils are contingent on the amounts and reliability of early wet season rainfall or on amounts of stored water after harvesting rice. Apart from drought, waterlogging and inundation are significant water-related hazards that influence the growing of field crops in lowland soils. In addition, soil fertility constraints in the early wet season and dry season will likely differ from those encountered by rice {{due in part to}} the different soil water regime they encounter. In particular soil acidity, low nutrient status, hardsetting and <b>shallow</b> <b>rooting</b> <b>depth</b> have been identified as significant constraints for field crops. Vast areas of sandy upland soils occur in Cambodia but are only poorly described. Low soil fertility is likely to limit upland farming systems on the sandy uplands and erosion is a concern for their sustainable use. There is a need to hasten the pace of research and resource assessment of these uplands so that land suitability assessment and sustainable farming systems are available to guide the expansion of agriculture in these areas...|$|E

If the calculation of potential ET had been conducted for rougher surface conditions and for higher LAI of the forest, the ET values would have been higher because of the greater atmospheric and canopy conductance of the forest canopy. Poplar had lower LAI and roughness and thus lower potential to transpiration than oak. Grass had much lower potential for ET because its height and LAI are the lowest from the three vegetation types. Moreover, it probably had limited groundwater access as well due to its <b>shallower</b> <b>root</b> <b>depth.</b>|$|R

These hypotheses were tested by comparing the water relations of Great Basin shrubs growing in sand versus loam soils. The eight study species (Chrysothamnus nauseosus, Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus, Chrysothamnus parryi, Tetradymia glabrata, Atriplex canescens, Atriplex confertifolia, Grayia spinosa and Sarcobatus vermiculatus) varied in typical <b>rooting</b> <b>depth</b> and vegetative phenology. 3.

The land use suitability analysis indicated that the largest portion of the region 1562993 ha (83. 26 %) and 1039522 (55. 37 %) were unsuitable for groundnut and sweet potato crops production, respectively due to clay in soil texture(k), <b>shallow</b> <b>root</b> <b>depth</b> (r) available phosphorus (p) and low climatic temperature (t).

40|$|OA-fund In this study, land surface related {{parameter}} {{distributions of}} a conceptual semi-distributed hydrological model are constrained by employing time series of satellite-based evaporation estimates {{during the dry}} season as explanatory information. The approach has been applied to the ungauged Luangwa river basin (150 000 (km) 2) in Zambia. The information contained in these evaporation estimates imposes compliance of the model with the largest outgoing water balance term, evaporation, and a spatially and temporally realistic depletion of soil moisture within the dry season. The model results in turn provide {{a better understanding of the}} information density of remotely sensed evaporation. Model parameters to which evaporation is sensitive, have been spatially distributed on the basis of dominant land cover characteristics. Consequently, their values were conditioned by means of Monte-Carlo sampling and evaluation on satellite evaporation estimates. The results show that behavioural parameter sets for model units with similar land cover are indeed clustered. The clustering reveals hydrologically meaningful signatures in the parameter response surface: wetland-dominated areas (also called dambos) show optimal parameter ranges that reflect vegetation with a relatively small unsaturated zone (due to the <b>shallow</b> <b>rooting</b> <b>depth</b> of the vegetation) which is easily moisture stressed. The forested areas and highlands show parameter ranges that indicate a much deeper root zone which is more drought resistent. Clustering was consequently used to formulate fuzzy membership functions that can be used to constrain parameter realizations in further calibration. Unrealistic parameter ranges, found for instance in the high unsaturated soil zone values in the highlands may indicate either overestimation of satellite-based evaporation or model structural deficiencies. We believe that in these areas, groundwater uptake into the root zone and lateral movement of groundwater should be included in the model structure. Furthermore, a less distinct parameter clustering was found for forested model units. We hypothesize that this is due to the presence of two dominant forest types that differ substantially in their moisture regime. This could indicate that the spatial discretization used in this study is oversimplified. WatermanagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
40|$|This model {{analysis}} of catch crop effects on nitrate retention covered three soil texture classes sand, loamy sand, sandy loam) and three precipitation regimes in a temperate climate representative for northern Europe (annual precipitation 709 - 1026 mm) {{for a period}} of 43 years. Simulations were made with two catch crops (ryegrass and Brassica) with different rooting depths, and soil N effects in the next spring were analysed to 0. 25, 0. 75 and 2. 0 m depth to represent the catch crop effect on following crops with different rooting depths. Nitrate retained without a catch crop was generally located in deeper soil layers. In the low precipitation regime the overall fraction of nitrate retained in the 0 - 2. 0 m soil profile was 0. 23 for the sandy soil, 0. 69 for the loamy sand and 0. 81 for the sandy loam. Ryegrass reduced leaching losses much less efficiently than Brassica, which depleted nitrate in the 0 - 0. 75 m soil layer more completely, but also in the deeper soil layer, which the ryegrass could not reach. A positive N effect (Neff, spring mineral N availability after catch crop compared with bare soil) was found in the 0 - 0. 25 m layer (i. e. <b>shallow</b> <b>rooting</b> <b>depth</b> of a subsequent main crop) in all three soil texture classes, with on average 10 kg N ha- 1 for ryegrass and 34 kg N ha- 1 for Brassica. Considering the whole soil profile (0 - 2. 0 m deep rooting of next crop), a positive Neff was found in the sandy soil, whereas generally a negative Neff was found in the loamy sand and especially the sandy loam. The simulations showed that for shallow-rooted crops, catch crop Neff values were always positive, whereas Neff for deeper-rooted crops depended strongly on soil and annual variations in precipitation conditions. These results are crucial both for farmers crop rotation planning and for design of appropriate catch crop strategies with the aim of protecting the aquatic environment...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{processes}} of degradation threaten soil functions. Ten {{of them are}} acknowledged by the European Union and fifteen by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), but at least another seven have been indicated by different authors in Italy and {{in other parts of}} the world. This short review paper summarizes the nature, economic relevance, and territorial impact of soil degradation in Italy, and with reference to Europe as a whole, and highlights the most relevant research needs in soil conservation. The direct annual costs of the main soil degradation processes are estimated to be over 38, 000, 000, 000 euro per year in Europe as a whole, while in Italy, only for landslides, floods, and soil erosion, costs amount to 900, 000, 000 euro. Loss of the ability to produce food commodities because of soil degradation is particularly important in Italy, since selfsufficiency in food has recently decreased to less than 80 % and Italian agricultural soils are hit by several problems, such as limited soil drainage, unfavorable texture and stoniness, <b>shallow</b> <b>rooting</b> <b>depth,</b> and poor chemical properties. On average, soil sealing, reduction in organic matter, and soil compaction in Italy are comparable with those of many other countries, but the occurrence of soil erosion, floods, and landslides is more widespread than in most parts of Europe, and also the presence of salt-affected soils is becoming a major worry. The fight against soil degradation in Italy is certainly more difficult than in other countries because of the high environmental variability. However, according to the current trends, Italy is mostly probably destined not to achieve the European objective to significantly reduce main soil degradation processes by the year 2020. There are several research needs in the field of soil conservation in Italy. These include: i) a better basic knowledge about many soil degradation processes and of pedodiversity; ii) reliable, sensitive, and locally validated models for main degradation processes; iii) assessment of resilience of different soils against degradation processes, as well as of their reaction to the measures foreseen in the current European agricultural policy...|$|E

40|$|Water is a {{controversial}} topic in agriculture and future development. The clearing {{of land and}} the conversion to cropping and irrigation is currently being discussed for {{the region of the}} Daly River catchment. Proposals to develop sheep and cattle grazing country into cropping and irrigation have been put forward to the Northern Territory Government. These proposals have forced the Northern Territory Government to produce an Integrated Regional Land Use Plan to assess hydrological, biological, environmental and social impacts on the catchment and the Daly River. To assess the hydrological impacts, computer modelling was conducted in MIKE SHE on the changes in water balance. Three soil column water balance models have been produced and calibrated to simulate different land use scenarios. These scenarios include current conditions, native vegetation, and future agricultural development, improved pasture and irrigated peanuts. The analysed results from the water balance models include evapotranspiration, overland flow, crop water use and groundwater recharge. The computer modelling results were compared for the three land use scenarios. It was found that the canopy density and the <b>root</b> zone <b>depth</b> for the crop type had the greatest influence of the water balance. The canopy density controlled the level of surface exposure affecting evaporation rates. High canopy densities (high leaf area index) led to increased evaporation from the canopy while a decrease in evaporation from ponded water and from the soil. The <b>root</b> zone <b>depth</b> dictated the crops ability to draw moisture from the unsaturated zone. <b>Shallow</b> <b>root</b> <b>depths</b> of improved pasture and irrigated peanuts led to increased recharge, increased soil water storages and a rapid decrease in the transpiration rate (for improved pasture) during the dry season...|$|R

The Columbia site was located on Mexico silt loam, and the Mount Vernon site on Viraton silt loam. The first study examined the feasibility of harvesting switchgrass for biomass and summer forage within a season. Yields and forage quality were compared between four harvest management treatments: a single post-frost harvest for biomass, a forage harvest at boot stage followed by a post-frost biomass harvest, biomass harvest at post-anthesis with summer regrowth harvested as forage, and biomass harvest at pre-anthesis with summer regrowth harvested as forage. Summer regrowth was minimal at Mount Vernon due to a fragipan and <b>shallower</b> <b>rooting</b> <b>depth</b> at that site. Regrowth had greater lignin content and as a result, was less digestible.

40|$|The {{waste product}} {{resulting}} from the alumina refining process consists of residue sand and mud which is laid on bauxite residue disposal areas (RDAs). Once the RDAs have been effectively solar dried they are revegetated to minimise deep drainage and potential groundwater contamination. In this study, two RDAs located at Alcoa 2 ̆ 7 s Pinjarra refinery were seasonally monitored {{to determine the effects}} of irrigation on soil water availability and plant water use. Three experimental Blocks were established by Alcoa, each with an irrigated and unirrigated site. Since then, irrigation has been applied to the three treated sites to maintain the root zone water holding capacity throughout the dry months (October - April). Soil samples were collected at 0. 25 m intervals to a maximum depth of 3 m and analysed for their gravimetric soil water content, soil water potential, soil particle size, pH and. electrical conductivity. Plant water potential, stomatal conductance and transpiration were measured for three species, Eucalyptus gomphocephala, Acacia cochlearis and Hardenbergia comptoniana. In addition, these measurements were also carried out at a native site for comparison between vegetation growing on the artificial RDAs, reliant solely on soil stored water and native vegetation, with access to deeper water sources. This study identified the RDAs to have sufficient soil water availability at both the irrigated and unirrigated sites to maintain seasonally high plant water potentials and contribute to only mild levels of plant water stress. All plants lowered their stomatal conductance in the dry months with the first rains of the wet season increasing stomatal activity and transpiration. Over the wet period, the unirrigated plants exhibited lower stomatal conductance and transpiration rates than irrigated plants, most likely due to their smaller leaf area. H comptoniana maintained the highest water potential of the three species, which may be attributed to significant leaf shedding in the dry months. This species also responded rapidly to the first rains with the establishment of new growth and higher rates of transpirational water losses through the wet period compared to E. gomphocephala and A. cochlearis. It appears that irrigation plays an important role in the rapid establishment of seedling biomass, however it has no significant effect on the level of water stress experienced by plants growing, on the RDAs.

Deterioration of the environment in these landscapes by dryland salinity, nutrient losses, soil degradation, emission of greenhouse gases and loss of biodiversity may be averted by phases of native woody species and shrubs.

There are indications, however, that lucerne {{may not be as}} efficient as woody species in dewatering the soil profile. Some recent studies in America have shown that mitigation of net global warming potential by lucerne was significantly less than woody species, due to nitrous oxide emissions and lime requirements in the lucerne and resistance of woody species to decomposition in the soil. Pastures such as lucerne have different biodiversity values compared with native woody species. Phases of different ages of native woody species are likely to provide multiple niches for enhanced biodiversity, provided biological assets are maintained when cropping and/or pasture phases are resumed.

Field studies were performed with a potato crop in 1993 and a sugar beet crop in 2002 to evaluate their impact on nitrate leaching. The overall predictive quality of the STICS soil–crop model was first evaluated using field data and then the model was used to analyze dynamically the impacts of different crop management practices on nitrate leaching. The model was evaluated (i) on soil nitrate concentrations at different depths and (ii) on crop yields. The simulated values proved to be in satisfactory agreement with measured values. Nitrate leaching was more pronounced with the potato crop thanwith the sugar beet experiment due to i) greater precipitation, ii) lower N uptake of the potato crop due to <b>shallow</b> <b>root</b> <b>depth,</b> and iii) a shorter period of growth.

Complementary virtual experiments were carried out using the STICS model. Our study confirmed that in vulnerable zones agricultural practices must be adjusted, that is to say: 1) N-fertilizer should not be applied in autumn before winter crops; 2) crops with low N uptake capacity (e. g. potatoes) should be avoided or should be preceded and followed by nitrogen catch crops or cover crops; 3) the nitrate concentration of irrigation water {{should be taken into}} account in calculation of the N-fertilization rate, and 4) Nfertilization must be precisely adjusted in particular for potato crops...|$|R

Three oilseeds [canola (Brassica napus L.), mustard (Brassica juncea L.) and flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) ], three pulses [chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), dry pea (Pisum sativum L.) and lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) ], and spring wheat were seeded in removable 100  cm deep x   15  cm diameter lysimeters placed in an Aridic Haploboroll soil, in southwest Saskatchewan in 2006 and 2007. Crops were studied under rainfed and irrigated conditions where lysimeters were removed and sampled for plant biomass and WU at various soil depths. Wheat yields were greater than pulse crop yields which were greater than oilseed yields, and WUE averaged 4. 08  kg ha- 1  mm- 1 for pulse crops, 3. 64  kg ha- 1  mm- 1 for oilseeds, and ranged between 5. 5 and 7. 0  kg ha- 1  mm- 1 for wheat.

Based on the field surveys of Makino bamboo root morphology, a three-dimensional (3 -D) numerical model of the soil-root system consisting of the reverse T-shape tap root and hair roots was developed and successfully applied to the finite element simulations of in situ pull-out tests. In the simulations, the soil mass was simulated by a soil element with a perfect elastic-plastic (or Mohr-Coulomb) material model whereas the root system was simulated by a ground anchor element with a linear elastic material model. In addition, a mechanical conversion model with simple mathematical form, which enables a direct transformation of the ultimate pull-out resistance into the shear strength increment of soil-root system was proposed. The conversion model offered a convenient way to quantify the reinforcement effect of the Makino bamboo root system required for the 3 -D slope stability analyses. The numerical {{results indicated that the}} shear strength increment of the Makino bamboo soil-root system ranged from 18. 4 to 26. 3 kPa and its effect on the slope stability was insignificant when compared with those adverse influence factors such as the steep slope angle (= 50 - 70 degrees), <b>shallow</b> <b>root</b> <b>depth</b> (= 0. 8 - 1. 0 m) and large growth height (> 10 m) of the Makino bamboo forest slopeland.

40|$|Background: Windthrow, the {{uprooting}} {{of trees}} during storms associated with strong winds, is a well-established cause of mortality in temperate {{regions of the}} world, often with large ecological consequences. However, this phenomenon has received little attention within arid regions and is not well documented in southern Africa. Slow rates of post-disturbance recovery and projected increases in extreme weather events in arid areas mean that windthrow could be more common and have bigger impacts on these ecosystems in the future. This is of concern due to slow rates of post-disturbance recovery in arid systems and projected increases in extreme weather events in these areas. This study investigated the spatial pattern, magnitude and likely causes of windthrown mortality {{in relation to other}} forms of mortality in Aloe dichotoma, an iconic arid-adapted arborescent succulent and southern Africa climate change indicator species. Results: We found that windthrown mortality was greatest within the equatorward summer rainfall zone (SRZ) of its distribution (mean[*]=[*] 31 %, n[*]=[*] 11), and was derived almost exclusively from the larger adult age class. A logistic modelling exercise indicated that windthrown mortality was strongly associated with greater amounts of warm season (summer) rainfall in the SRZ, higher wind speeds, and leptosols. A statistically significant interaction term between higher summer rainfall and wind speeds further increased the odds of being windthrown. While these results would benefit from improvements in the resolution of wind and substrate data, they do support the hypothesised mechanism for windthrow in A. dichotoma. This involves powerful storm gusts associated with either the current or subsequent rainfall event, heavy convective rainfall, and an associated increase in soil malleability. <b>Shallow</b> <b>rooting</b> <b>depths</b> in gravel-rich soils and an inflexible, top-heavy canopy structure make individuals especially prone to windthrown mortality during storms. Conclusions: Results highlight the importance of this previously unrecognised form of mortality in A. dichotoma, especially since it seems to disproportionately affect reproductively mature adult individuals in an infrequently recruiting species. Smaller, more geographically isolated and adult dominated populations in the summer rainfall zone {{are likely to be more}} vulnerable to localised extinction due to windthrow events...|$|R
40|$|The {{evapotranspiration}} (ET) flux {{accounts for}} approximately {{two thirds of}} terrestrial precipitation worldwide, and in grassland regions ET is equivalent in magnitude to precipitation. Regional contributions to the terrestrial hydrologic budget, however, have been far from constant {{in the past as}} distribution of vegetation changed dramatically. The rise of grass-dominated ecosystems {{is one of the most}} profound paleoecological changes in the Cenozoic. Why then, would grassland expansion not feature prominently in the record of Neogene hydrologic change? Despite numerous stable isotope paleoenvironmental studies in Neogene North America, the contributions of land cover change have been largely ignored. We present a compilation of 16 oxygen isotope studies of pedogenic carbonate and smectite from western North America, including 4 new records. Nearly all records from California, the Basin and Range, the Rocky Mountains and the Great Plains show increases in View the MathML source on the order of 2 – 6 ‰. In order to assess the role of ET in the hydrologic cycle, we developed an isotopic water vapor transport model wherein we manipulated ET parameters along a specified air mass trajectory. Grasslands lead to View the MathML source of precipitation (View the MathML source) values that are up to 5 ‰ greater than broadleaf and needleleaf vegetation at inland study sites. These results demonstrate that changes in vegetation played a critical role in establishing the modern hydrologic regime in western North America. We suggest that this isotopic increase is due to three primary reasons: 1) Increased evaporation and transpiration fluxes in grassland regions affect water balance, 2) <b>Shallower</b> <b>rooting</b> <b>depths</b> of grasses lead to the transpiration of soil water enriched in View the MathML source due to evaporation, and 3) Grasslands transpire View the MathML source-rich waters during a shorter, more punctuated growing season. We argue that the observed isotope signals are indicative of a feedback mechanism wherein grasslands not only respond to regional and global climatic trends, but also act as a driver of hydrologic change. By enhancing seasonality and aridity, grasslands transmit hydrologic disturbances downstream, engineering climatic conditions favorable for their expansion...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of four {{vegetation}} transects {{that were}} established on the Bassendean Dune System, northern Swan Coastal Plain classified 42 native plant species into four ‘habitat’ {{groups based on}} their preferred soil moisture regimes (Havel 1968). Using adult abundance and distribution data from three of these transects and an additional transect established in 1976, we investigated the various ecological responses of myrtaceous shrub species representing the four habitat groups to long-term (20 - 30 yr) decreasing groundwater and soil moisture levels. Myrtaceous shrubs were chosen for analysis because of their widespread occurrence and diversity on the Swan Coastal Plain, and because Myrtaceae is the only plant family to be represented in all four of Havel’s habitat categories. Myrtaceous species ‘tolerant of excessive wetness’ (Astartea fascicularis, Hypocalymma angustifolium, Pericalymma ellipticum, Regelia ciliata) are all <b>shallow</b> <b>rooted</b> (<b>rooting</b> <b>depth</b> < 1 m), occur in winter-wet depressions, and displayed the greatest reduction in population size in response to decreasing groundwater levels. Species cateogorised as displaying ‘maximum development on dry sites’ (Eremaea pauciflora, Melaleuca scabra, Scholtzia involucrata) commonly occurred on the upper and mid-slopes of the transects, are deeper-rooted and varied in their population response to long-term declines in water availability. All three species probably rely to some extent on accessing soil moisture at depth (2 - 6 m) during summer drought. The scenario was similar for species ‘optimum on moist sites’ (M. seriata) and for species ‘without clear-cut site preferences’ (Calytrix flavescens). In the context of Havel’s four habitat categories, whether a particular habitat preference is ‘wet’ or ‘dry’ refers to availability of soil moisture, although to what soil depth and moisture levels are uncertain. Habitat preferences, based on soil moisture availability, may have no relevance to a species preferred groundwater regime and hence response to decreasing groundwater levels. A species’ groundwater requirements during periods of drought are dependent on {{their position in the}} landscape, summer groundwater depth and the species <b>rooting</b> <b>depth...</b>|$|R
40|$|Plants in Mediterranean {{ecosystems}} {{have developed}} different strategies {{to cope with}} transient soil-moisture dynamics induced by the markedly out of phase seasonal behavior of rainfall and temperature. Deep-rooted plants use the soil moisture stored in the wet winter (extensive users), while <b>shallower</b> <b>rooted</b> plants exploit both the wet season storage and the more sporadic growing season rainfall (intensive users). Using stochastic models of soil moisture dynamics, we present an analytical and numerical description of the probabilistic structure of the soil-moisture storage {{at the beginning of}} the growing season in relation to the dynamics of the wet season, and then study its evolution during the subsequent growing season. Special attention is devoted to plant water stress as a function of the <b>rooting</b> <b>depth</b> and the soil moisture storage {{at the beginning of the}} growing season. The existence of an optimal <b>rooting</b> <b>depth</b> for Mediterranean climates and its dependence on future hydro-climatic scenarios are discussed with reference to a test case in Sicily, Italy.

40|$|This report {{focuses on}} the {{interaction}} of vegetation and groundwater in a study area in the Pantanal of Mato Grosso, Brazil. This area is a mosaic of patches of different vegetation types. Many {{studies have focused on}} the effect of the inundation that occurs every summer and depending on the elevation inundates the vegetation zero to nine months. From these studies it is apparent that the vegetation distribution is influenced by inundation. However, during the annual dry season the surface water recedes almost entirely and the groundwater can drop up to 5. 6 m below soil surface. The effect of this drought has not been investigated further. To study the effects of groundwater on the vegetation distribution a groundwater model is created using PCRasterMODFLOW. Using the vegetation distribution and a digi-tal elevation map created from 230 elevation points, three scenarios are modeled in which only the evaporation varies per scenario. In the first scenario the evaporation does not decrease when the groundwater drops and the evaporation is uniform over space. In the second scenario the evaporation decreases linearly with falling groundwa-ter levels. In this scenario all the vegetation has a <b>root</b> <b>depth</b> of 3 m. This indicates that the vegetation has no influence on the evaporation. In the third scenario the evaporation again decreases linearly with falling groundwater levels, however the <b>root</b> <b>depth</b> de-pends on the vegetation. This indicates that the evaporation is dependent on both <b>root</b> <b>depth</b> (thus vegetation) and groundwater depth. The results show that the vegetation distribution is not affected by the groundwa-ter. However, the vegetation has a strong influence on the groundwater distribution. Deep rooted vegetation decrease the groundwater level up to 2 m lower than <b>shallow</b> <b>rooted</b> vegetation does. This causes groundwater to flow {{in the direction of the}} deep rooted vegetation. Deep rooted vegetation immediately adjacent to <b>shallow</b> <b>rooted</b> vege-tation benefits most, for the <b>shallow</b> <b>rooted</b> vegetation immediately adjacent to deep rooted vegetation it is most disadvantageous. Further, it can be shown that deep rooted vegetation is least stressed by the drought and therefore the deep rooted vegetation is not limited by groundwater. A different environmental variable will more likely be re-sponsible for the patchiness of this area...|$|R

Over time these roots systems will alter their environment and facilitate storage and uptake of water and nutrient availability.

Two field experiments are reported in which this phenomenon was observed. The first experiment involved Plantago lanceolata L. and Lolium perenne L. and the second involved Plantago lanceolata L. and Anthoxanthum odoratum L. In a third competition experiment between Plantago lanceolata L. and Anthoxanthum odoratum L. it was tested whether this observed phenomenon was indeed caused by the differences between the <b>rooting</b> <b>depths</b> of these species. The experiment was divided into one series where different <b>rooting</b> <b>depths</b> were possible and one series where gauze with a narrow mesh width prevented differences between <b>rooting</b> <b>depths.</b> In the series without gauze the predicted frequency-dependence of the relative crowding coefficient was observed, whereas in the series with gauze the relative crowding coefficient was independent of plant frequency. A comparison between the yields in the series with and without gauze suggests that in mixture Plantago is forced to utilize the nutrients from deeper soil layers, whereas {{this is not the case}} in monoculture. Although such phenomena complicate the description of the process investigated, it is concluded that the model proposed provides an approximate prediction of most results of the experiments which were carried out...|$|R

Malagkit Pirurutong and Binicol were identified as the two rice accessions with deepest roots through four field experiments conducted at two different locations in West Africa. For these two accessions, <b>root</b> <b>depths</b> reached 35. 6 and 41. 4  cm, respectively, in the first experiment at Bamako; on the other hand, their depths only reached 22. 6 and 18. 6  cm, respectively, {{in the second and third}} experiments at Ibadan, leading to inconsistent genotypic ranking based on <b>root</b> <b>depth</b> between the two locations.

40|$|The water {{relations}} and photosynthesis of Agave deserti Engelm., a plant exhibiting Crassulacean acid metabolism, were {{measured in the}} Colorado desert. Although no natural stomatal opening of A. deserti occurred {{in the summer of}} 1975, it could be induced by watering. The resistance for water vapor diffusion from a leaf (RWV) became less than 20 sec cm− 1 when the soil water potential at 10 cm became greater than − 3 bars, as would occur after a 7 -mm rainfall. As a consequence of its <b>shallow</b> <b>root</b> system (mean <b>depth</b> of 8 cm), A. deserti responded rapidly to the infrequent rains, and the succulent nature of its leaves allowed stomatal opening to continue for up to 8 days after the soil became drier than the plant. When the leaf temperature at night was increased from 5 to 20 C, RWV increased 5 -fold, emphasizing the importance of cool nighttime temperatures for gas exchange by this plant. Although most CO 2 uptake occurred at night, a secondary light-dependent rise in CO 2 influx generally occurred after dawn. The transpiration ratio (mass of water transpired/mass of CO 2 fixed) had extremely low values of 18 for a winter day, and approximately 25 for an entire year...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} paper {{in this series}} a model was proposed lor the competition between plant populations with different <b>rooting</b> <b>depths.</b> This model predicts that in mixtures of plant populations with different <b>rooting</b> <b>depths</b> the Relative Yield Total will exceed unity. Secondly it predicts that in these mixtures the relative crowding coefficient of the deep rooting population {{with respect to the}} <b>shallow</b> <b>rooting</b> one will decrease with increasing plant frequency. Two competition experiments in deep pots are carried out to test these predictions. In the first experiment a comparison is made between a series in which nutrients limited plant growth severely and a series in which nutrients were applied in a quantity that allowed high productivity. In the nutrient poor series the Relative Yield Total exceeded unity by about twenty per cent, while in the nutrient rich series only a small deviation from one was observed. The second experiment was divided into a series of deep pots in which different <b>rooting</b> <b>depths</b> were possible and a series of shallow pots in which the two species were forced to share the same space. In the series of shallow pots the relative crowding coefficient of the two species was found to be independent of plant frequency. In the series of deep pots the relative corowding coefficient of the two species with respect to each other did decrease significantly with increasing frequency. The observed frequency-dependence for the <b>shallow</b> <b>rooting</b> species could be explained by an extension of the theory presented previously. In the spacing series used in the same experiment a decrease of the shoot to root ratio with increasing plant density was observed. Furthermore, in the replacement series the shoot to root ratio in mixture was found to be lower than in monoculture. The consequences of these phenomena for the estimation of the relative crowding coefficient and the Relative Yield Total on the basis of shoot weights are discussed. However, it is argued that the fact that shoot to root ratios change with plant frequency does not provide an alternative explanation for the frequency-dependence observed...|$|R
40|$|Unused {{inorganic}} N (Ninorg) left {{in agricultural}} soils will typically leach to deeper soil layers. If it moves below the root zone {{it will be}} lost from the system, but the <b>depth</b> of the <b>root</b> zone depends on the crop species grown. In this experiment we studied the effect of three-year crop sequences, with different combinations of deep and <b>shallow</b> <b>rooted</b> crops, on soil Ninorg dynamics to 2. 5 m soil depth {{and the possibility of}} crop utilization of N leached to deep soil layers. We grew 10 different crop sequences for three years. The crops and catch crops grown were selected to allow different sequences of deep and <b>shallow</b> <b>rooted</b> crops. Very different <b>rooting</b> <b>depths</b> were obtained, from only 0. 5 m (leek), to approximately 1. 0 m (ryegrass and barley), 1. 5 m (red beet), 2. 0 m (fodder radish and white cabbage) and more than 2. 5 m by the chicory catch crop. The results showed a significant retention of Ninorg within the 2. 5 m soil profile from one year to the next, but the retained N was moved to larger soil depths during the winter season. Only little Ninorg was retained over two winter seasons. The retention in the deeper soil layers allowed Ninorg to be taken up by succeeding deep rooted main crops or catch crops. The effects of crop <b>rooting</b> <b>depth</b> on Ninorg in the subsoil layers from 1. 0 to 2. 5 m were striking. White cabbage reduced Ninorg below 1. 0 m with up to 100 kg N ha 1 during its growth. Grown after catch crops, leek and red beet left on average 60 kg N ha 1 less below 1. 0 m than leek and red beet grown without a preceding catch crop. We conclude {{that it is possible to}} design crop rotations with improved nitrogen use efficiency by using the differences in crop rooting patterns; deep rooted crops or catch crops can be used to recover Ninorg leached after previous crops, and catch crops can be grown before <b>shallow</b> <b>rooted</b> crops to lift the available Ninorg from deep soil layers to upper layers where these crops have their roots. ...|$|R

40|$|Shrubs of the Great Basin {{desert in}} Utah are {{subjected}} to a prolonged summer drought. One poten-tial consequence of drought is a reduced water transport capability of the xylem.

The shrubs fall into three categories with regards to <b>rooting</b> <b>depth,</b> vegetative phenology and plant water status during drought. The “sum-mer green ” group (Chrysothamnus viscidiflorus, Atriplex canescens, Atriplex confertifolia) sustains summer drought with a relatively <b>shallow</b> <b>root</b> system (< 2. 5 m), but maintains leaf area.
