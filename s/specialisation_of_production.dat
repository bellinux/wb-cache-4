40|$|This paper {{develops}} a spatial {{model for a}} water basin that allows for surface water allocation and re-use of the water that is lost. The analytical solution suggests <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> over space - upstream farmers use canal water and downstream farmers pump groundwater that is lost upstream. Groundwater emerges as an endogenous "backstop. " The empirical results suggest that when traditional conservation technologies are used, optimisation over the entire basin leads to significant increases in aggregate output, project area and water use. Somewhat counter-intuitively, rents from water decrease if farmers switch from traditional to modern irrigation technology...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} and formalises {{an approach to}} the evolution of the organisation of industry which starts from multi-activity firms, and which relates to economists like Young, Stigler, and Richardson. To capture the open-ended process of disintegration of industry, the paper operates with decomposable tasks and gives an account of the vertical and horizontal structure of production by means of weighted trees — in the graphtheoretical sense. Based on this addition to the analytical toolbox, the paper gives an account of the decomposition of industry as driven by the structural innovations and process innovations of firms that specialise and exchange in an open-ended evolutionary process.

The paper provides an insight into the challenges and opportunities that Pakistan’s non-agricultural sectors face as they become rapidly integrated into global markets. The paper identifies those non-agricultural export categories in which Pakistan is losing, gaining, or maintaining its export competitiveness. The study examines {{the extent to which}} Pakistan’s leading non-agriculture product lines have witnessed a shift in comparative advantage away from the traditional labour-intensive production to the export <b>of</b> technologybased <b>production</b> activities. The study also provides an in-depth investigation <b>of</b> export <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> Pakistan’s non-agriculture <b>production</b> sectors by dividing key HS 4 -digit non-agricultural product lines into six distinct groups based on their position in Pakistan’s RCA profile. To assess the relative competitive position of various manufacturing and mining activities, the study also provides a comprehensive analysis at the sectoral level. ...|$|R

Several national cases are analysed: Britain as the Workshop of the World; France, Germany, Switzerland and the US as core economies; Italy and Spain as countries on the European periphery; and Japan as a successful export latecomer. The main question that we address is why some cotton industries vertically integrated their production and selling processes, but others did not. We present a model that combines industrial district size and product differentiation to explain why vertical integration was present in most cases and why there was vertical <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and selling in Lancashire, Lowell and Japan. cotton industry, commercialisation, vertical integration, vertical specialisation, Industrial Revolution, transaction costs, Industrial Organisation,...|$|E

Despite the lack of natural resources and unfavourable climate, the high labour and energy costs, the Dutch district and the horticulture cluster based in Netherlands hold a leading position. The historical development of the three districts is very similar, but the application of science and the role of local institutions are the explanatory factor of the evolutionary path of the cluster located in the Netherlands.

40|$|High-speed trains {{could be}} used to solve two {{different}} accessibility problems. In the first case, where a point to point link is dominant, they are a potential substitute for air travelling. In the second case it links together many cities and, hence, creates a new type of region or corridor with a high interregional accessibility. One important hypothesis for the discussion in this paper {{is the degree to which}} cities that are linked together into a band of cities by means of a high-speed train connection are transformed to an extended functional region or in other words an integrated corridor economy. This paper particularly examines economic integration in a corridor economy in the short, medium and long term. In considering the short-term perspective we discuss not only the integration of goods and service markets but also the integration of labour markets and markets for shopping, private services and leisure activities. The discussion of the medium term perspective is concentrated on the relocation of households and firms within a high-speed train corridor. To study the long-term integration effects of a high-speed train corridor we maintain that the analysis must be conducted using a genuinely dynamic model for the <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and, hence, for trade with and transport of goods and services and consequently transport of people. ...|$|E
40|$|In 2003, {{significant}} {{changes were made}} to the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) through the Mid Term Review (MTR). The changes are regarded as the most radical of EU rural policy {{in the history of the}} CAP by, although continuing in the direction of the 1992 reforms, shifting policy payments from the product to, instead, the producer in the form of a single farm payment, which to receive requires compliance with statutory management requirements related to good agricultural and environmental standards. Predicting how farmers will react is complicated and the precise response from the industry is largely unknown. This study moves beyond the economistic orientation of other investigations by reporting the actions of farmers in South West England and their acknowledgement of the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) influencing their plans. Thirty-seven percent of farmers in the study acknowledged that the SPS influenced their plans. It is shown that the response of farmers can be radically different. The four main perspectives identified are associated with the polarisation between large farms increasing their agricultural activities and the smaller farms reducing theirs and, across all farms, a simplification of farming businesses. The simplification of businesses is shown to be frequently associated with the <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> systems and the adoption of less intensive systems. Business cycle, in relation to the SPS, is shown to influence change. However, the study cautions that there is uncertainty among farmers and that some are adopting a 'wait to see' approach before making plans. Faculty of Social Science & Busines...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the development}} of a garment cluster in La Laguna, North Mexico, since the coming into effect of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Employment in the local garment industry increased rapidly and working conditions improved, due to increasingly stringent buyer standards. However, both buyer-supplier and employee-worker relations became strained, causing some entrepreneurs to relocate operations to cheaper sites and others to adopt a modular production strategy to save on labour costs - and shift co-ordination and management risk onto workers. La Laguna's <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> jeans <b>production</b> for export is a form <b>of</b> hyper <b>specialisation</b> that may well be required in global markets, for the sake of cost efficiency, but it also enhances the vulnerability of a cluster in the face of fluctuating world demand and changing international trade policies.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} farm level impacts of {{multiple}} peril yield and revenue insurance in an expected value-variance framework. The analysis is conducted using stochastic simulation jointly with numerical optimisation. Simulation {{is used to}} compute the means and variances of revenues as affected by the insurance schemes under consideration. In a second step these results are incorporated in a whole-farm programming approach, which optimises a portfolio that consists <b>of</b> crop <b>production</b> and insurance activities. The results of a case study indicate that from the farmer's point of view there is an incentive to buy multiple peril crop insurance, because it significantly reduces the variability of income. The risk reduction through insurance in turn leads to a <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>production</b> program. The farm level benefit of crop insurance strongly depends on the decision maker's degree of risk aversion. Furthermore, risk free parts of the total income reduce the economic attractiveness of insurance schemes. This applies e. g. to the area payments under the European agricultural policy, which therefore limit the potential demand for crop insurance. crop insurance, risk management, portfolio selection, stochastic programming, expected value-variance analysis, Risk and Uncertainty,...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} {{of a collection of}} essays on endogenous trade policies and may briefly be summarized as follows. The first essay empirically examines determinants of bilateral trade protection originating from normative trade theory, endogenous trade-policy studies, and political arguments put forward in the public debate. Overall protection level measures are constructed and the data sample includes a total of 426 trade relations. The maximum likelihood estimation results provide strong empirical support for five of the seven tested determinants, and since no omitted variable problem can be detected, the empirical model appears to incorporate all the factors functioning as determinants at the time of observation. The explanatory variables revealed to influence the bilateral protection level are the import penetration level of goods produced by the trade partner, the share of imports from the trade partner characterised by intra-industry trade, and dummy variables capturing if the trade relation is characterized by the joint bilateral customs union participation, a rich importing country and a middle-income exporting country or a large importing country and a small exporting country. A performed sensitivity analysis shows that the results appear to be unaffected by multicollinearity and endogeneity as well as omitted variable problems. The second essay theoretically examines the economic role of trade policy in a Krugman and Venables (1995) model modified to allow for country-specific trade cost levels and incorporate trade costs in the homogenous goods sector. Specifically, unilateral trade-cost effects on the equilibrium structure are identified and the resulting national welfare consequences obtained in order to identify the endogenous trade-policy positions when trade policies are used as strategies in a game between benevolent governments. It is revealed that the existence of trade costs in the homogenous goods sector has a considerable influence on equilibrium structure effects of differentiated goods trade policies and, hence, on equilibrium strategies in differentiated goods trade. In particular, the identified equilibrium strategies in the differentiated goods sector incorporate substantially lower protection levels when homogenous goods trade costs are allowed for. Moreover, it is shown that the identified policy equilibria always generate locational equilibria characterised by a complete international dispersion of production. The third essay is theoretical and explores the economic role of trade policy in a new economic geography model based on intermediate input linkages within as well as between sectors. Specifically, the effects of unilateral trade policies on the international production and trade pattern are identified in a Krugman and Venables (1996) model modified to allow for asymmetric trade cost levels across sectors and countries. Moreover, national welfare effects of these policies are examined and the trade-policy determination is endogenised in a trade-policy game between benevolent governments. It is revealed that the presence of inter-industry input-output linkages between firms imposes counteracting effects on the international production and trade pattern. Furthermore, it is shown that the equilibrium strategies are normally free-trade policy positions and that locational equilibria generated from the game can be characterised either by a complete international <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> or a complete international dispersion of industry categories...|$|E
40|$|Présentation en ligne (45 diapositives) Ongoing {{intensification}} and <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> livestock <b>production</b> lead {{to increasing}} volumes of manure to be managed, {{which are a}} source of the greenhouse gases (GHGs) methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). Net emissions of CH 4 and N 2 O result from a multitude of microbial activities in the manure environment. Their relative importance depends not only on manure composition and local management practices with respect to treatment, storage and field application, but also on ambient climatic conditions. The diversity <b>of</b> livestock <b>production</b> systems, and their associated manure management, is discussed on the basis of four regional cases (Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, China and Europe) with increasing levels of intensification and priorities with respect to nutrient management and environmental regulation. GHG mitigation options for production systems based on solid and liquid manure management are then presented, and potentials for positive and negative interactions between pollutants, and between management practices, are discussed. The diversity of manure properties and environmental conditions necessitate a modelling approach for improving estimates of GHG emissions, and for predicting effects of management changes for GHG mitigation, and requirements for such a model are discussed. Finally, we briefly discuss drivers for, and barriers against, introduction of GHG mitigation measures for livestock production. There is no conflict between efforts to improve food and feed production, and efforts to reduce GHG emissions from manure management. Growth in livestock populations are projected to occur mainly in intensive production systems where, for this and other reasons, the largest potentials for GHG mitigation may be found...|$|R

The results show the significance <b>of</b> <b>specialisation</b> in <b>production</b> as a determinant of asymmetries in the regions and the importance of the geographical location of a region in accounting for its level of asymmetry.

40|$|Background to this {{contribution}} Serving industrial {{markets as}} a sub-contractor {{seems to be}} an important position taken by small and medium-sized enterprises. Aggregated figures for Europe (European Commission, 1994) indicate that the share varies between one third in some countries to more than half in other countries such as Italy for example. A Danish in-depth study indicates that approximately 45 per cent of SME manufacturers are sub-contractorsi (Andersen and Christensen, 1998). The market for sub-contracted goods is becoming increasingly international. This is facilitated by the international infrastructure, facilitating an expansion of logistic borders. It is also triggered by a growing number <b>of</b> global <b>production</b> networks controlled across national boundaries by transnational corporations. At the same time it is triggered by a <b>specialisation</b> <b>of</b> activities in <b>production.</b> Large international firms sub-contract- or out-source- larger shares of their value added than before. This is mirrored in overall patterns of international trade in semi-manufactured goods (Lüthje, 1999, OECD, 1992). Whereas there seems to be little disagreement about the role taken on by transnational corporations in the organisation of what is often labelled globalii supply chains, {{there seems to be some}} disagreement as to the implications for small and medium-sized sub-contractors and the local industrial communities in which they are embedded.
