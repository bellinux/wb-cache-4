Instead of Lacy attending the meeting, actor Paul Robeson did. Robeson, though a noted black actor and advocate of civil rights, was a controversial figure {{due to his}} affiliation with the Communist Party. The owners heard Robeson out, but at Landis's suggestion, did not ask him any questions or begin any discussion with him.|$|E
5|$|Sigismund III's confessor {{and court}} priest, who were Jesuits, {{supported}} Radziwiłł against Andrew. Thereafter, Andrew urged the Holy See to send Franciscan friars to Transylvania {{instead of the}} Jesuits (who were supported by Sigismund Báthory). He also suggested that the pope <b>should</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> Franciscan friar bishop of Transylvania, with a see in Csíksomlyó (now Șumuleu Ciuc in Romania). He settled Catholic priests in four villages on his estates. The Holy See authorized him to set up deaneries in Transylvania, making him the actual head of the Catholic Church in the principality.|$|E

5|$|There is {{no reason}} why the writ of error should be {{confined}} to civil cases. A man's life, his liberty, and his good name, are as dear to him as his property; and inferior courts are as liable to err in one case as in the other. There is nothing {{in the nature of the}} cases which <b>should</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> difference; nor is it a novel doctrine that a writ of error should lie in a criminal case. They have been frequent in that country from which we have drawn almost all our forms of judicial proceedings.|$|E
5|$|Member of parliament, Inge Myrvoll, and {{president}} of the Norwegian Airline Pilots Association, Cpt.Peter Helland, both stated that the Accident Investigation Board <b>should</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> new inquiry about the accident. Cpt. Helland stated that the report's credibility was weakened due to the influence de Havilland Canada had during the process. On 10 June, the commission reopened the case, after having held meetings with Tyrer. The commission stated that there was disagreement as to if the tail rudder and tail plane or the end piece had cracked first, which would be crucial in determining the cause of the accident. Among the inquiries would be to re-investigate the tape of cockpit sound with new technology. The Accident Investigation Board used the National Aerospace Laboratory in the Netherlands to conduct tests on the end pieces. The report from the National Aerospace Laboratory was published on 23 March 1995, and supported the conclusion in the commissions report. The journalist Oddvar Kristoffersen in Fremover won the SKUP Award for 1994 for his work related to uncovering the controversy. The pilots' union in Widerøe was initially critical of the report, but by July it stated that it supported the conclusion. In addition, Det Norske Veritas withdrew its critical comments concerning the commission. With this, all officially involved parties supported the report.|$|E

25|$|At this time, William was in {{love with}} the Polish Princess Elisa Radziwill.

He and his wife Elisabeth Ludovika had been married three years and had no children.

25|$|There are {{no rules}} for how many species <b>should</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> genus, a family, or any other higher taxon (that is, a taxon in a {{category}} above the species level). It should be a natural group (that is, non-artificial, non-polyphyletic), as judged by a biologist, using all the information available to them. Equally ranked higher taxa in different phyla are not necessarily equivalent (e.g., it is incorrect to assume that families of insects are in some way evolutionarily comparable to families of mollusks). For animals, at least the phylum rank is usually associated with a certain body plan, which is also, however, an arbitrary criterion.|$|E
25|$|One blessing over a {{particular}} food {{is sufficient for}} the entire meal and {{does not need to}} be repeated. A communal meal only needs one set of blessings for the entire group, but individuals dining together (albeit not as a group) must say the blessings individually. The food of primary importance is the one which a blessing is said for. However, if one is eating a sandwich, the blessing for the bread would be said rather than the blessing for the sandwich's contents, since bread is never considered being of secondary importance.

25|$|The {{timing of}} the presidential {{announcement}} was tied also {{to the fact that}} Ridgway's forces were fast approaching the 38th parallel. The consensus in Washington was that the Chinese and North Koreans would be more inclined to agree to a cease-fire under conditions restoring the status quo ante bellum, that is, if the fighting could be ended {{in the vicinity of the}} parallel where it had begun. Therefore, while there was no intention to forbid all ground action above the parallel, there was some question in the mind of Secretary of State Dean Acheson and among many members of the United Nations whether the Eighth Army <b>should</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> general advance into North Korea.|$|E

25|$|Hamilton {{asked his}} {{team on the}} radio whether he <b>should</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> pit stop to which they responded that he should remain on the track.

Hamilton was annoyed and asked why he {{was not allowed to}} make a pit stop on the {{previous}} lap and dropped back from Rosberg so that he would not to wait behind his teammate. Vergne was released directly in front of Magnussen, causing him to swerve to prevent contact. This prompted the stewards to investigate Vergne. On lap 28, Räikkönen had to make a second pit stop for a punctured tyre after Chilton's front wing glanced his left-rear wheel at Mirabeau corner. Räikkönen thus fell {{to the back of the}} field. Ricciardo and Alonso consequently moved into third and fourth. The safety car drove into the pit lane at the end of lap 30 and racing resumed with Rosberg leading Hamilton. As the race restarted, Magnussen passed Vergne going into Rasacasse corner but handed the position back because it had occurred before crossing the second safety car line. Hülkenberg took advantage and drove aggressively by going down the inside of Magnussen at Portier corner and passed him before entering the tunnel to claim seventh.|$|E
25|$|Dionysus organizes a {{swimming}} contest and allows Ampelus to win. Ampelus is elated by his success and dresses up as a Bacchante {{as a form}} of celebration. Dionysus warns the boy to stay close to him, just in case a deity is jealous of their happiness and tries to kill him. A portent tells Dionysus that Ampelus will die and become a vine. Ate (Delusion) makes Ampelus jealous reminding him that Dionysus and the gods usually give their friends a special present, a special mount, and suggests that he <b>should</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> bull his own. Deluded, Ampelus rides a bull and provokes Selene by saying that he is a better bull-rider than her. Selene sends a gadfly to sting the bull. The animal starts kicking and Ampelus falls on his head on the ground. A satyr brings Dionysus the ill news. Dionysus prepares the body for the funeral and makes a long lament. Eros tries to console and distract him with the story of Calamos and Carpos, two handsome youngsters who were in love with each other. During {{a swimming}} contest Carpos drowns and Calamos, incapable of living without him, commits suicide. Calamos becomes the reeds of the river and Carpos the fruit of the earth. Dionysus is comforted with the story but mourning does not leave him. In the meantime the Seasons visit the house of Helios, the Sun.|$|E

The establishment was run – [...] "with considerable personal pomp", according to Bax – by Cecil Sharp, whose passion for English folk-song and folk-dance excited no response in his pupil. An enthusiasm for folk music was widespread among British composers {{of the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, including Parry, Stanford, Vaughan Williams and Holst; Sullivan and Elgar stood aloof, as did Bax, who later put into general circulation the saying, [...] "You <b>should</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> point of trying every experience once, excepting incest and folk-dancing." ...|$|E
