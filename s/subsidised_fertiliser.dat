5000|$|The most {{significant}} factor in this impressive increase in output and productivity was the spread of high-yield rice varieties. By the mid-1980s, 85 percent of rice farmers used highyield variety seeds, compared with 50 percent in 1975. High-yield varieties were promoted together with <b>subsidised</b> <b>fertiliser,</b> pesticides, and credit through the [...] "mass guidance" [...] or Bimas rice intensification program. This extension program also offered technical assistance to farmers unfamiliar with the new cultivation techniques. The new technology was not without its own problems, however. Several major infestations of the brown planthopper, whose natural predators were eliminated by the heavy use of subsidised pesticides, led to a new strategy in 1988 to apply the techniques of integrated pest management, relying {{on a variety of}} methods aside from pesticide to control insects and rodents. To help reduce pesticide use, in 1989 the subsidy on pesticides was eliminated.|$|E
40|$|Several agro-ecological {{practices}} {{have been developed}} to increase the range of soil fertility management options available to farmers, but little information is available on their labour input requirement and profitability relative to conventional practices. This study used a multiple visit cost-route method to estimate labour inputs and financial profitability of agroforestry-based and conventional (with and without fertiliser) soil fertility management practices in eastern Zambia. Results show that aggregated over a five-year cycle, labour inputs used under agroforestry practices were lower than fertilised maize fields but higher than non-fertilised continuous cropped maize. Agroforestry practices were more profitable (NPV ranging between $ 233 and $ 327 ha- 1) than unfertilised maize fields (NPV of $ 130 ha- 1) but less profitable than fertilised maize fields. The NPV for the latter is $ 499 ha- 1 under a 50 % government subsidy on fertiliser but, it fell to $ 349 ha- 1 when the subsidy effect is removed. In terms of return per unit investment cost, agroforestry practices performed better with a benefit to cost ratio ranging between 2. 77 to 3. 13 in contrast to 2. 65 (<b>subsidised</b> <b>fertiliser)</b> and 1. 77 (non-subsidised fertiliser). The returns to labour per person day was $ 2. 56 in (non-subsidised) fertilised maize field, $ 3. 16 in <b>subsidised</b> <b>fertiliser</b> field, $ 2. 63 in Gliricidia fields, $ 2. 41 in Sesbania fields, $ 1. 90 in Tephrosia fields, and $ 1. 10 in non-fertilised maize fields. The results do not support the popular notion that agroforestry practices are more labour intensive. It suggests that in addition to total labour use requirements, the temporal distribution of labour use during the farming season is important. It is concluded that agroforestry practices are profitable, and could contribute to food security.

40|$|Malawi’s {{implementation}} of a large scale agricultural input subsidy programme in 2005 / 6 and subsequent years has attracted significant international interest. This paper reviews the background, processes, achievements and outcomes of the programme over the period 2005 / 6 to 2008 / 9. The very large scale disbursement of heavily <b>subsidised</b> <b>fertilisers</b> and (mainly hybrid and composite maize) seed to very large numbers of beneficiaries across the country represents a significant logistical achievement and led to significant increases in national maize production and productivity, and this has contributed to increased food availability, higher real wages and wider economic growth and poverty reduction. However the latter years of the programme have also been accompanied by very high international fertilizer prices and costs and by high maize prices, the latter undermining the programme’s food security, poverty reduction and growth benefits {{for the majority of}} Malawian farmers, who are very poor and rely on purchased maize for significant amounts of their staple food requirements. Estimated economic returns to the programme have been satisfactory, given other benefits of the programme not captured in cost benefit analysis. With substantial reductions in both prices and <b>subsidised</b> volumes of <b>fertilisers</b> in subsequent years, there is considerable scope for building on achievements to substantially raise programme effectiveness, efficiency and benefits. Any application of Malawi’s subsidy experience to other countries needs to take account of special characteristics of the Malawian maize economy and of measures needed to raise such programmes’ effectiveness and efficiency and ensure their best fit with and contribution to sustainable development policies...|$|R
40|$|Mineral {{fertiliser}} is a scarce input for smallholder maize {{farmers in}} Malawi. A recent provision of {{small amounts of}} <b>subsidised</b> <b>fertilisers</b> by government programmes to farmers throughout Malawi has increased fertiliser access and raised maize production, but fertiliser management and yield responses frequently remain poor. To seek ways to use the fertiliser more efficiently, we analysed the effects of low rates of N (15 or 30 kg N ha- 1) and P (9 kg P ha- 1) fertiliser in combination with improved weed management on maize yields in experiments on 12 smallholder farms in Chisepo, central Malawi. Several indices of N and P use efficiency were computed from the above-ground crop components and nutrient contents. Maize yield simulations were conducted using long-term rainfall records in the APSIM crop-soil system model. NP fertiliser significantly (p < 0. 001) raised maize grain yield from 0. 65 to 1. 5 t ha- 1, and twice-weeding fertilised maize significantly (p < 0. 001) raised maize yields by 0. 4 t ha- 1 compared with weeding once (0. 9 t ha- 1). The agronomic efficiency of applied fertiliser N (AEN) averaged 19. 3 kg grain kg N- 1 with one weeding but doubled to 38. 7 kg with the additional weeding. The physiological efficiency of applied N (PEN) was 40. 7 kg grain kg- 1 N uptake. APSIM predicted that similar or larger maize yield responses to 15 or 30 kg N ha- 1 can be expected in 8 out of 10 years in areas with similar rainfall patterns to Chisepo. A financial analysis showed that the application of these small amounts of fertiliser was economic even when fertiliser was purchased from the open market, provided the crop was adequately weeded. Participatory assessments helped farmers understand the increased efficiency of fertiliser use possible with additional weeding, although some farmers reported difficulty implementing this recommendation due to competing demands for labour. We conclude that to raise the productivity and sustainability of fertiliser support programmes in Malawi, initiatives should be introduced to help identify and educate farmers on the major drivers of productivity in their systems...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} ten years, Malawian peasant farming {{households}} have endured a number of material and life-threatening setbacks. The absence of <b>subsidised</b> <b>fertiliser</b> loans to farmers continues to trouble villagers a decade after their removal. Yields of both food and cash crops have been declining. Farming households' earnings from agricultural exports and remittances have decreased. The creeping and then intensified incidence of HIV/AIDS infection has led to widespread debility and death, compounded by a serious famine in 2001 - 03. During the famine and its aftermath, ganyu casual labour gained in importance {{as a source of}} income, especially for women and youth from poor rural households. Field evidence suggests that the highly explotative contractual terms that employers offered widened the gap between the haves and have-nots, and fuelled the risks of contracting HIV/AIDS.

40|$|The Millennium Development Goals’ {{target to}} halve the {{proportion}} of {{people who suffer from}} hunger is extremely important in southern Africa, where food security has become increasingly problematic over the last 20 years. One “quick-win” proposal is replenishment of soil nutrients for smallholder farmers, through free or subsidised chemical fertilisers. Other proposals include appropriate irrigation technology, improved inputs and interventions targeted at women. Analysis of over 10 years of agro-hydrological and agro-economic studies from southern African show that a different approach is required to interventions proposed. There are sustainability problems with free chemical fertiliser due to transport costs and ancillary costs. Furthermore, recent studies in Zimbabwe and Mozambique show that significant increases in yield can only be obtained when soil fertility management is combined with good crop husbandry, e. g. timely planting and weeding. Ongoing replenishment of fertility would be dependent on a continued free or <b>subsidised</b> <b>fertiliser</b> supply, and transport system. Increasing access to irrigation will help, but is not the only solution and cannot reach even a majority of farmers. It has been determined that short dryspells are often the major cause of low yields in sub-Saharan Africa.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impacts}} of the Farm Input Subsidy Programme (FISP) using a balanced four-year panel of 461 households from 2004 / 5, 2006 / 7, 2008 / 9 and 2010 / 11 agricultural seasons. We find evidence of economy wide and input market effects of the subsidy programme. The economy-wide effects of the subsidy programme are strong particularly due to lower maize prices and increased ganyu wage rates. The economy-wide effects of the subsidy which arise from higher ganyu wage rates, reduced time spent on ganyu, availability of maize at local level and lower prices of maize have enabled poor households to access maize when they run {{out of their own}} production. With respect to input market effects, with 2010 / 11 conditions and quantities of <b>subsidised</b> <b>fertiliser,</b> a 1 percent increase in subsidised fertilisers reduces commercial demand by 0. 15 – 0. 21 percent. However, using various welfare indicators, we find mixed results on the direct beneficiary household effects of the subsidy programme from panel data analysis and there is no overwhelming evidence on the relationship between repeated access and impacts of the subsidy. The direct beneficiary impacts on food consumption, self-assessed poverty and overall welfare are weak and mixed while there is some statistically significant evidence of positive impacts on primary school enrolment, under- 5 illness and shocks. Nonetheless, the impact analysis highlights the challenges of targeting and sharing of subsidy among households, which may have implications on the direct beneficiary impacts and prospects t...|$|E
40|$|Pakistan has {{a history}} of subsidising {{agricultural}} inputs. Although none of the agricultural inputs were subsidised during the early 1950 s, the process was initiated {{in the second half of}} the decade by <b>subsidising</b> chemical <b>fertilisers</b> in order to popularise their use [Niaz (1984) ]. The list of subsidised inputs and the rate structure of the subsidies were expanded considerably throughout the Sixties. Towards the end of the Sixties, it was noted that almost all the agricultural inputs including fertilisers, insecticides, seeds, irrigation water, tubewell installations, and the operation and purchase of tractors and tractor-related equipment were subsidised in one form or another [Aresvik (1967) and Kuhnen (1989) ]. In the 1970 s, some curtailment of subsidies occurred as a result of input price increases which followed the worldwide recession, a major oil shock, the credit crunch, the war with India, and the consequent steep devaluation of Pakistani Rupee [Chaudhry (1982) ]. Although the subsidies had survived the onslaught of the Seventies and tended to persist on most inputs, the government became totally committed to their removal beginning with the 1980 s, under pressures from the IMF and the World Bank [Government of Pakistan (1980) ]. As a consequence, there was a total withdrawal of subsidy from seeds, insecticides, tubewells, and tractors. A phased-out withdrawal of fertiliser subsidy, culminating in 1984 - 85 in the case of nitrogenous fertilisers and in 1989 - 90 in the case of phosphatic and potash fertilisers, was also to be undertaken [World Bank (1986) ]. The purpose of the present paper is to highlight the progress of withdrawal of input subsidies in Pakistan, to study the nature of the input subsidies and possibly analyse the impact of the withdrawal of subsidies on the farm sector. Needless to add that the study is also intended to make policy recommendations on the various aspects of subsidy withdrawal. ...|$|R
40|$|Although there are, in some cultures, no indiscrete {{questions}} {{but only}} indiscrete answers, the old trick question "Are you still beating your wife?" cuts {{quite close to}} the bone. It symbolises excessive familiarity, the power of rumour, the burden of being very well informed, the temptation to interfere. It shocks so strongly that the only response can be a laugh. The equally intrusive question "Are you still beating your Mother Earth?" fits the same bill, except that the answer "Yes" is already known. And it is no laughing matter. Next time it rains, wherever you are, go and watch the water run down a slope. Those streaks of brown you see are mud, humus, soil nutrients, organic fertilisers, particles of compost and they are running away from you. One man s loss through erosion for the brown streaks came from land that probably belonged to a man although {{it may have been}} nurtured by a woman is another man s gain. Someone, somewhere in a delta probably quite far away, in a century from now, will be quite grateful for that other person s loss of soil fertility. Do not deplete Soil fertility depletion is the fundamental cause of low per capita food production in Africa, according to Pedro Sanchez, {{the former director of the}} World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF). Addressing the assembled captains of agribusiness at the World Agricultural Forum in St Louis, United States in May 2003, Sanchez explained that over the decades small-scale farmers have removed large quantities of nutrients from their soils without returning them as manure or fertiliser in sufficient quantities. In a flurry of statistics, he asserted that this has resulted in a very high average rate of fertility depletion: 22 kg of nitrogen (N), 2. 5 kg of phosphorus (P) and 15 kg of potassium (K) per hectare of cultivated land per year over the past 30 years in 37 African countries. At scales like this, it is no longer a marginal loss, but a massive haemorrhage, well worthy of the sad modern term soil mining. When soils have been so severely depleted of nutrients, the full potential of genetically modified (GM) and improved varieties of crops cannot be realised. In such conditions, GM crops and <b>subsidised</b> <b>fertilisers</b> are not even an option in boosting crop yields. Sanchez contended that the remarkably low improvements in yield following the introduction of improved varieties (see Table) in sub-Saharan Africa are due primarily to depleted soil fertility. The way to restore and replenish fertility lies along a simpler route, according to Sanchez, whose experience is principally in Eastern and Southern Africa: a combination of N fixation through leguminous tree fallows, the use of P from indigenous phosphate rock deposits, and the transfer of additional nutrients and carbon using the leaves of the shrub Tithonia diversifolia which accumulates nutrients. Learn fertility management online Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM) is the topic of a new online course in the agLe@rn series from the Asia-Pacific Regional Technology Centre (APRTC). It pays special attention to adapting ISFM options to the agronomic and socio-economic needs and interests of farmers. It also discusses the tools and data needed to analyse the impact of these options. A pilot course is due to start in late June 2003; the next session will be from 3 November to 12 December.

In the entrance hall of the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) in Ottawa, Canada hangs a clock with two meters, one showing the rise in world population every second and the other the decrease in the world s arable land. You can also track them on the Website www. idrc. ca and imbed them in your computer. In the time you will take to read this article it s about 1, 700 words, let s say 15 minutes 117 hectares of arable land will be lost. In the time between when this article was conceived (mid-March) and when it was published (June), 850, 000 hectares were lost. That is roughly equal to all the arable land in Togo. Replenish in plenty In the improved fallow approach, leguminous tree species such as Sesbania and Tephrosia are interplanted with a young maize crop and allowed to grow as fallows during dry seasons. In subhumid tropical areas, they accumulate between 100 and 200 kg N in 6 24 months, depending on the frequency of the rains. The wood is harvested, and the N-rich leaves, pods and branches are hoed as so-called green manure compost and animal wastes into the soil before maize is planted for the following rainy season. Maize yields increase by a factor of 2 4, and almost attain the levels achievable by applying recommended rates of N fertiliser. This method, which won Sanchez the World Food Prize in 2002, fits snugly into the work patterns of resource-poor farmers. It also produces firewood, captures nitrates which have leached into the subsoil, recycles other nutrients, controls the notorious parasitic Striga weed, improves the soil structure and sequesters carbon from the atmosphere. This last function is a case of win-win farming on which Spore shall expound in a later issue in 2003 : the capture of carbon is good for the soil and the farmer, and good for the world too. The emission of carbon gas into the atmosphere by industry, fossil fuel consumption in transport and energy generation, and by agriculture through heavy tillage is one of the world s most guilty practices, since it is exacerbating global warming and speeding up the rate of climate change. Through a variety of mechanisms, international funds are available for farmers and communities in developing countries to sequester carbon. Replenishment can also occur through the use of man-made inorganic fertiliser, but in sub-Saharan Africa where average annual fertiliser use is 9 kg per hectare, compared with a global average of 98 kg, costs and the need for tailored mixes to suit African soil conditions stand in the way. Recent initiatives such as Marketing Inputs Regionally (see box) should help to address these issues at policy level. Keeping mum for Mother Earth Soil fertility can also be enhanced by conservation measures: contour strips and ridges, Zai holes (see Spore 87), cover plants, reduced tillage (good for carbon sequestration) and control of water run-off are among the best practices. Yet measures are needed elsewhere too: in organising reliable supplies of seedlings of fallow trees and shrubs, setting up finance systems loans and, even more important, savings and insurance to stimulate affordable input supplies, and tackling land tenure issues. As Philip Kiriro of the Kenya National Federation of Agricultural Producers (KENFAP) told a joint conference of the FAO and the International Fertilizer Industry Association (IFA) on Sustainable Fertilisation, in Rome in March 2003, "without secure access to resources, a farmer does not have the necessary incentive to invest in his land. Providing land titles is not a huge expense for governments, but it provides a strong motivation to family farmers. " It all sounds so simple, and within the confines of the small plots of the small farmer, in those sparking plugs of the engine that is agriculture, perhaps it really is. But heed the earthy tones of Louise Fresco, Assistant Director-General of the FAO, whose typical Dutch attitude to life, and to soil nutrients, is the "Ja-Neen-Maar" ("Yes, No, But") model. At the FAO-IFA conference she spoke on the theme of what we know, what we guess, and what we don t know. We know that, for higher yields, we need to use fertilisers more, and that they are, particularly in Africa with its specific soils, irreplaceable. But we don t know how far we can increase their efficiencies. We guess at the potential of micronutrients, of urban waste and of organic agriculture and we need to research them more. Organic agriculture, she said, appears to be unfeasible, with its staggering greed for land, legumes and animal waste to replace mineral fertilisers. Nor do we know what changes in world diets, and consequent demands on the soil, will emerge from the coming wave of international summitry on sustainable consumption. Or what the effect will be when hydroponics (cultivation in a soil-free medium) becomes a popular form of food production. There are so many imponderables that it is tempting to seek refuge in the old saying "The answer lies in soil". Indeed so, but only if we don t lose it. Farmers efforts first The 2003 CTA seminar will revisit what the CTA Annual Report 2002 (see Between Us) calls "an old issue in African agriculture: the conundrum of low soil fertility, appropriate fertiliser regimes and the challenges of ecological management. It will review the current situation and ascertain whether or how further research and analysis, and information services, can help in enhancing farmers efforts to increase agricultural productivity in a sustainable manner. " The seminar, provisionally scheduled for November, is an invitation-only event. But there will be ample opportunities for distance participation through electronic fora before, during and after the event watch for announcements in Spore and on the CTA Website.

Launching MIR in West Africa The Marketing Inputs Regionally (MIR) project is the brainchild of the Africa division of the International Fertiliser Development Centre (IFDC). It is based on the belief that "there will not and cannot be any agricultural progress in Africa without a reliable supply of agricultural inputs" and an effective market for them, stimulated by a vibrant private sector. At present, says Henk Breman, the division s director, input markets are impeded by undisclosed private and public interests, undeveloped transport infrastructures, limited access to finance, lack of information and poor business and organisational capacities. MIR supports the efforts of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA) and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to create regional markets. Other partners include the Network of Farmer Organisations and Agricultural Producers of West Africa (ROPPA), the Network of Chambers of Agriculture (RECAO), the Conference of Ministers of Agriculture of West and Central Africa (CMA/WCA), private input importers and dealers, and sector ministries. An operational MIR meeting held in Togo in March 2003 identified as priority action areas: increasing awareness of transborder trade opportunities and encouraging each sector (such as food or cotton) to finance its own input consumption. What is needed is to create a basis for economies of scale, to fight monopolies, to tackle hidden agendas and to facilitate the free movement of inputs.

In this data set 463 households were interviewed in both surveys and similar questions on some of the socio-economic indicators were asked during interviews to enable us to test the impact using a difference-in-difference estimator. We find evidence of economy wide and input market effects of the subsidy programme. The economy-wide effects of the subsidy programme are strong particularly due to lower maize prices and increased ganyu wage rates. With respect to input market effects, with 2010 / 11 conditions and quantities of <b>subsidised</b> <b>fertiliser,</b> a 1 percent increase in subsidized fertilizers reduces commercial demand by 0. 15 – 0. 21 percent. However, using various welfare indicators, we find mixed results on the direct beneficiary household effects of the subsidy programme from panel data analysis. Overall, there are positive impacts of the subsidy programme although some of the relationships are not statistically significant. The direct beneficiary impacts on food security, food onsumption, self-assessed poverty and overall welfare are weak and mixed while there is some statistically significant evidence of positive impacts on primary school enrolment, under- 5 illness and shocks. In addition, there is some evidence of positive trends in impact indicators as the number of times a household received the subsidy in the past 6 season increases. The economy-wide effects of the subsidy which arise from higher ganyu wage rates, reduced time spent on ganyu, availability of maize at local level and lower prices of maize have enabled poor households to access maize when they run out of their own production. Nonetheless, the impact analysis highlights the challenges of targeting and sharing of subsidy among households, which may have implications on the direct beneficiary impacts...|$|E
40|$|This report {{reviews the}} 2009 / 10 {{implementation}} of the Farm Input Subsidy Programme 2009 / 10 {{in the context of}} experience from 2005 / 6 to 2008 / 9. The 2009 / 10 programme differed from previous years in restriction of fertiliser subsidies to maize production, reduced fertiliser distribution budgets which were also adhered to, large increases in maize (particularly hybrid) and legume seed distribution, considerable carry forward of fertiliser stocks from previous year purchases, and earlier sales of fertiliser. These changes all have important positive implications for the programme’s effectiveness and efficiency as a result of reduced displacement, improved targeting, reduced programme costs (which also benefited from lower fertiliser prices), improved returns to use of <b>subsidised</b> <b>fertiliser</b> on hybrid maize, and food security, diversification and soil fertility benefits from the increased legume seed sales. Increased maize and legume seed sales through private retailers should also stimulate input market development. The economic benefit cost ratio for the programme is estimated at 1. 12, a respectable result (despite the many difficulties with this analysis and its blindness to many longer term and intangible benefits) with considerable potential for further improvement. The macro-economic costs of the programme have also been substantially reduced as compared with the previous year and the year on year rises in costs halted. These are important achievements. There are two main areas where it is proposed that programme implementation could look for substantial improvements in the future: first in achieving greater transparency in beneficiary identification and coupon issues and second in allowing earlier sales of inputs. Greater transparency in beneficiary identification and coupon issues should build on achievements {{over the last four years}} (for example in improved targeting and use of open meetings) by (a) resolving inconsistencies both in changing MoAFS farm family numbers across regions and with NSO estimates, (b) improving effective communication about coupon allocation and distribution systems, (c) increasing the transparency and accountability of these processes with, for example, the involvement of different stakeholders representing farmers, and (d) sharing and implementing good practice in particular districts or areas more widely across the country. Earlier input sales are important for reducing the costs and risks faced by farmers in redeeming coupons, promoting higher yield responses from earlier planting and fertiliser application, reducing pressures and costs in fertiliser deliveries to markets, and giving farmers more voice and choice when redeeming coupons. This requires that the 2009 / 10 improvements in fertiliser deliveries and in seed contracting are sustained and accompanied by earlier finalising of coupon allocations and printing than in 2009 / 10 – as has already been recognised by strenuous attempts to achieve earlier commencement of sales in 2010...|$|E
