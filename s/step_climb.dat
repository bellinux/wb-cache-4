2500|$|The squad's {{performance}} in the stage 1 team time trial was mediocre, as they finished with six riders in ninth place 25 seconds back of the winners [...] Farrar took fourth {{the next day in}} a slight uphill sprint to Playas de Orihuela. Haussler was unable to finish {{at the front of the}} race, coming in a minute back. Martin took his first high placing in stage 4. He led the group of overall contenders home for third place on the day behind solo stage winner Daniel Moreno, on Sierra Nevada. Moreno and Chris Anker Sørensen had broken away [...] from the summit, with the overall contenders essentially content to let them go. The team missed out on the sprint finish to stage 7. Just as Farrar hit the front to begin his sprint, he touched wheels and crashed with 's Michał Gołaś. The team stuck by him, as all members besides Martin and Le Mével finished at the back of the peloton. Farrar started the next day, but did not complete the stage. Martin took a strong placing on this stage, which ended on a very <b>step</b> <b>climb</b> at San Lorenzo de El Escorial. He finished ninth, 15 seconds back of Joaquim Rodríguez.|$|E

30|$|To {{confirm that}} the {{proposed}} <b>step</b> <b>climbing</b> method is better {{in terms of the}} <b>step</b> <b>climbing</b> of the large wheels, it is compared with the method that uses only the traction force of the drive wheel.|$|R
30|$|In the experiment, {{the height}} of the step was assumed as 100  mm, just as in the simulation. As {{previously}} described, in the <b>step</b> <b>climbing</b> process of the front casters, the wheelchair performs a static wheelie motion so that the front casters hover above the ground. In the <b>step</b> <b>climbing</b> process of the large wheels, the large wheels hover above the ground until they are at the same height as the step, and in the <b>step</b> <b>climbing</b> process of the drive wheel, the drive wheel climbs {{along the side of the}} step by cooperative control of the linear actuator and the drive wheel. The experiment investigated whether the wheelchair could perform these <b>step</b> <b>climbing</b> processes using the constructed mechanism.|$|R
30|$|In this study, for {{expanding}} the activity area of wheelchair users, a novel <b>step</b> <b>climbing</b> method for a five-wheeled wheelchair has been proposed, and an add-on mechanism for realizing this method by electric operation has been developed. In a previous {{research by the}} authors, a five-wheeled wheelchair composed of a manual wheelchair and an active-caster drive system was suggested. The wheelchair with this configuration can perform a stable “static wheelie” motion by hovering the front casters, while the other three wheels contact the ground, and can similarly maintain the stability when the large wheels hover. By making use of these hovering motions, electrically operated <b>step</b> <b>climbing</b> processes for the front casters and large wheels have been recommended. Additionally, a <b>step</b> <b>climbing</b> method for the drive wheel has been proposed. The series of wheelchair motions involved in this <b>step</b> <b>climbing</b> method was analyzed by deriving the kinematics model, and the proposed method was compared with a <b>step</b> <b>climbing</b> method that uses only the traction force of the drive wheel to confirm its advantage. Moreover, the design conditions of the mechanism for realizing the proposed <b>step</b> <b>climbing</b> method were obtained through a simulation analysis and used to construct a prototype. Finally, a motion experiment was performed with the prototype {{to confirm that the}} wheelchair can <b>climb</b> over a <b>step</b> by the suggested method.|$|R

50|$|Aircraft {{efficiency}} {{increases with}} height. Burning fuel decreases {{the weight of}} an aircraft which may then choose to increase its flight level to further improve fuel consumption. For example, an aircraft {{may be able to}} reach FL290 early in a flight, but <b>step</b> <b>climb</b> to FL370 later in the route after weight has decreased due to fuel burn off.|$|E
50|$|Originally, {{a simple}} cruise climb {{was used by}} pilots. This {{amounted}} to a simple, continuous, very gradual climb from an initial cruise altitude to a final cruise altitude, and made the most efficient use of fuel. However, with increasing air traffic and the assignment of distinct flight levels to specific flights, airways, and directions of flight, {{it is no longer}} safe to climb continuously in this way, and so most flights compromise by climbing in distinct steps - a <b>step</b> <b>climb</b> - with ATC approval, {{in order to ensure that}} the aircraft is always at an appropriate altitude for traffic control. While not quite as efficient as a continuous cruise climb, step climbs are still more efficient than maintaining a single altitude throughout a flight. The <b>step</b> <b>climb</b> intervals may be 1000, 2000, or 4000 feet, depending on the flight level rules which apply on the particular airway being flown.|$|E

30|$|In the {{previous}} sections, {{the advantage of}} the <b>step</b> <b>climbing</b> method by the proposed mechanism was confirmed. In this section, the design conditions of the mechanism for realizing the proposed method are derived. As previously described, in the proposed <b>step</b> <b>climbing</b> method, the front casters hover above the ground by a static wheelie motion, the large wheels hover above the ground by the action of the linear actuator, and the drive wheel <b>climbs</b> the <b>step</b> by cooperative control of the linear actuator and the drive wheel. The design conditions required for the proposed mechanism to perform each of these <b>step</b> <b>climbing</b> processes were investigated through a simulation.|$|R

5000|$|Some pilots use [...] "rules of thumb" [...] for {{determining}} when {{to perform a}} <b>step</b> <b>climb.</b> These [...] "rules" [...] do not consider the effects of different winds at different levels; computerised flight planning systems may be better at height optimisation, and may even include 'step descents' in certain weather conditions.

50|$|Failed {{to follow}} cleared SID: The pilot failed to follow {{comply with the}} level {{restrictions}} include in a SID. Failed to follow cleared SID is a particular issue with departures from Gatwick, Stansted, and Luton although other airports are affected. Gatwick, Stansted and Luton all have <b>step</b> <b>climb</b> SIDs and these errors normally involve an aircraft failing {{to stop at the}} first stop altitude.|$|E
50|$|For most {{passenger}} aircraft, {{the cruise}} phase consumes {{most of the}} aircraft's fuel. This lightens the aircraft and raises the optimum altitude for fuel economy. For traffic control reasons it is usually necessary for an aircraft {{to stay at the}} cleared flight level. On long-haul flights, the pilot may ask air traffic control to climb from one flight level to a higher one. This maneuver is called a <b>step</b> <b>climb.</b>|$|E

30|$|In this study, a <b>step</b> <b>climbing</b> {{method for}} a five-wheeled {{wheelchair}} was proposed, and an add-on drive mechanism {{to realize this}} method was developed. The proposed mechanism could not only perform the <b>step</b> <b>climbing</b> method but also the previous functions of the wheelchair. Because the five-wheeled wheelchair has five points of contact with the ground, its increased stability allows the front casters or the large wheels to hover above {{the ground at the}} height of the step, as required by the proposed method. Moreover, a <b>step</b> <b>climbing</b> process of the drive wheel using cooperative control of the linear actuator and the drive wheel was proposed. The suggested <b>step</b> <b>climbing</b> method was compared with a method that uses only the traction force of the drive wheel, and its advantage in climbing over a high step was confirmed. To realize the proposed method, an add-on drive mechanism was developed, and the design conditions required for this mechanism were analyzed. Finally, a prototype was constructed and used to experimentally verify that a wheelchair user could climb over a high step safely using the proposed method and mechanism.|$|R
50|$|The climb phase, {{also known}} as climb out, of a typical flight of an {{aircraft}} is the period during which the aircraft climbs to a predetermined cruising altitude after take-off. The climb phase immediately follows take-off and precedes the cruise phase of the flight. Although a single climb phase is typical, multiple climb phases may alternate with cruise phases, particularly for very long flights in which altitude is increased as the weight of fuel aboard decreases (see <b>step</b> <b>climb).</b>|$|E
50|$|In 2008, Winglet Technology, {{with the}} help of Cessna, began flight testing epoxy/graphite {{elliptical}} winglets on a Citation X. Flight testing was nearing completion in late 2008, with FAA supplemental type certification expected in 2009. The winglets increase range by 150 nm, lower fuel burn by 4-5%, improve hot and high performance as well as climb rate, permitting a climb to flight level 430 in 22 minutes, as opposed to 26 minutes without the modification. Climb to flight level 450 at maximum takeoff weight is possible without a <b>step</b> <b>climb.</b> Cruise speed at altitude is expected to increase by 15 knots, and maximum takeoff weight will increase by 1200 lbs (545 kg). Excluding installation, the kit's projected cost is $395,000.|$|E
5000|$|The Step {{is known}} as the most {{technically}} difficult part of the typical Nepal-side Everest climb In some climbing seasons after heavy snowfall, the rock face could be bypassed with snow/ice climbing. Climbing the Hillary Step has the danger of a 10000 ft drop on the right (when going up) and an 8000 ft drop on the left. The Hillary Step is where the late Anatoli Boukreev found a body hanging from ropes {{at the base of the}} step as relayed by his book The Climb. One expedition noted that climbing the Hillary Step was [...] "strenuous", but did offer some protection from the elements. An unaided Hillary <b>Step</b> <b>climb</b> was rated as a Class 4 rock climb, but at almost 29,000 feet altitude.|$|E
30|$|In addition, a novel add-on mechanism, {{which can}} perform {{not only the}} {{suggested}} <b>step</b> <b>climbing</b> method but also the previous functions of the wheelchair, has been proposed. Because the five-wheeled wheelchair has five points of contact with the ground, when the front casters hover above the ground, the wheelchair has adequate stability due to other three wheels contacting the ground to easily perform a “static wheelie” motion. Similarly, the wheelchair can also maintain its stability when the large wheels hover above the ground. The proposed method makes use of this stability to achieve the <b>step</b> <b>climbing</b> of the front casters and large wheels, whereas the drive wheel is lifted onto the step by cooperative control of the linear actuator and drive wheel. By comparing with a <b>step</b> <b>climbing</b> method that uses only the traction force of the drive wheel, {{the advantages of the}} proposed method were analyzed. Moreover, the design conditions of the proposed mechanism for realizing the suggested <b>step</b> <b>climbing</b> method were derived.

50|$|As an {{aircraft}} burns fuel it gets lighter and can cruise higher {{where it is}} generally more efficient. <b>Step</b> <b>climbs</b> or cruise climbs facilitate this.

40|$|A {{compromise}} solution to increase flight efficiency in cruise, but without penalising capacity (or even safety), would be perhaps to remove (or relax) the minimum {{rate of climb}} (ROC) constraint and/or to reduce {{the height of the}} step climbs in cruise. In this paper, the benefits (in terms of total operating costs) and the associated impact on the air traffic management (ATM) of such “relaxed cruise” operations are quantified for a representative medium-haul aircraft under different scenarios, by means of an in-house trajectory optimisation software. Results show that by reducing the minimum ROC from 500 to 300 ftmin- 1, whilst keeping the <b>step</b> <b>climb</b> height according to current reduced vertical separation minima (RVSM) standard would give a good compromise between cost savings and impact on the ATM.

30|$|From {{equation}} (14), {{it can be}} {{seen that}} the <b>step</b> <b>climbing</b> of the large wheels by only the traction force is affected by the road condition and the load distribution of the wheelchair.|$|R
30|$|At first, the {{wheelchair}} {{stops in front}} of the step (Figure  5 (a)) and performs a static wheelie motion by hovering the front casters above the ground (Figure  5 (b)). While keeping the posture of the wheelie motion, {{the wheelchair}} performs a translational motion so that the front casters <b>climb</b> over the <b>step</b> (Figure  5 (c)). After the front casters climb, the large wheels are made to hover above the ground by changing the height of the drive wheel (Figure  5 (d)), and then they pass over the step by a translational motion (Figure  5 (e)). After the large wheels climb, the wheelchair performs a static wheelie motion on the step (Figure  5 (f)), and the brakes of the large wheels are locked. By cooperative control of the drive wheel and the linear actuator, the front casters land {{at the same time that}} the drive wheel <b>climbs</b> on the <b>step</b> (Figure  5 (g)). Finally, the wheelchair moves on the step (Figure  5 (h)) by translational motion. In the following section, the mechanism to realize this proposed <b>step</b> <b>climbing</b> method is introduced. The <b>step</b> <b>climbing</b> method is divided into three processes, namely the climbing processes of the front casters (Figure  5 (a)–(c)), the large wheels (Figure  5 (d),(e)), and the drive wheel (Figure  5 (f)–(h)). For each of these processes, the proposed <b>step</b> <b>climbing</b> method is compared with a method that uses only the traction force of the drive wheel, in order to confirm its advantage.

Flying wind optimal trajectories with a fuel-optimal vertical profile reduces average fuel burn of international flights cruising at a single altitude by 1 - 3 %. The potential fuel savings of performing en-route step climbs are not significant for many shorter domestic cargo flights that have only one <b>step</b> <b>climb.</b> Wind-optimal trajectories reduce fuel burn and travel time relative to the flight plan route by up to 3 % for the domestic cargo flights. However, for trans-oceanic traffic, the fuel burn savings could be as much as 10 %.
