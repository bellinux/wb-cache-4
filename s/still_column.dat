The base for Platinka Original vodka is the alcohol of “Lux” grade produced from 100% Rye mash in a continuous <b>still</b> <b>column</b> undergoing distillation five times. The final alcohol/water mix is put through traditional filtration with coal {{as well as an}} additional step of filtration through platinum enriched elements.|$|E

50|$|In 1824 the Haig {{distillery}} was opened. In 1830 {{it became}} the first distillery to produce Grain whisky using the <b>Column</b> <b>still</b> method invented by Robert Stein. In 1877 John Haig & Co merged with five other whisky companies to form the Distillers Company, with John Haig & Co coming under DCL's full ownership in 1919. Cameron Bridge produced both grain and malt whisky {{using a combination of}} pot <b>stills</b> and <b>column</b> <b>stills</b> until 1929, when it shifted exclusively to grain whisky production.|$|R
25|$|<b>Column</b> <b>stills</b> are {{frequently}} {{used in the}} production of grain whisky and are the most commonly used type of still {{in the production of}} bourbon and other American whiskeys. <b>Column</b> <b>stills</b> behave like a series of single pot stills, formed in a long vertical tube. Whereas a single pot still charged with wine might yield a vapour enriched to 40–50% alcohol, a <b>column</b> <b>still</b> can achieve a vapour alcohol content of 95.6%; an azeotropic mixture of alcohol and water.|$|R

25|$|Brandy {{is usually}} {{produced}} in pot stills (batch distillation), but the <b>column</b> <b>still</b> {{can also be}} used for continuous distillation. Distillate obtained in this manner has a higher alcohol concentration (approximately 90% ABV) and is less aromatic. Choice of the apparatus depends on the style of brandy produced. Cognac and South African brandy are examples of brandy produced in batches while many American brandies use fractional distillation in <b>column</b> <b>stills.</b>|$|R
50|$|Between his Dublin {{education}} {{and his work}} as an Excise Officer, Aeneas Coffey had ample opportunity to observe the design and workings of whiskey stills, as Ireland was the world’s leading producer of whiskey in the 19th Century, and Dublin {{was at the center}} of that global industry. This was how Coffey became familiar with a still design differing from the traditional copper pot alembic still commonly used in Ireland, the continuous, or <b>column,</b> <b>still.</b> First patented by a Cork County distillery in 1822, the <b>column</b> <b>still</b> remained a relatively inefficient piece of equipment, although it pointed the way towards a cheaper and more productive way to distill alcohol. It was that last point that captured Coffey’s imagination. Coffey made his own modifications to existing <b>column</b> <b>still</b> designs, so as to allow a greater portion of the vapors to re-circulate into the still instead of moving into the receiver with the spirit. The result was more efficient, producing a lighter spirit at higher alcohol content. Coffey patented his design in 1830, and it became the basis for every <b>column</b> <b>still</b> used ever since.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn 2009, we {{reported}} {{an association between}} low levels of ethyl carbamate (EC) in pot still cachaças from Paraíba State, Brazil, and distillation in copper pot stills equipped with cooled columns. To strengthen these observations, we extended our study to Pernambuco State and assessed 13 pot <b>still</b> and 20 <b>column</b> <b>still</b> cachaça brands. An EC range from < 40 to 532 μg/l was found; 18 brands exceeded the Brazilian limit (150 μg/l), 89 % of which were <b>column</b> <b>still</b> types. Mean EC concentration of pot still cachaças was very low (64 μg/l), and was well below the Paraíba study (220 μg/l). An on-site investigation of pot still distilleries associated with < 40 μg/l brands showed a connection to differences in the distillation apparatus. Maximising distillation reflux ratios in the ascending parts and minimising exposure to copper in the descending parts (through the use of stainless steel) can reduce EC, and also avoid copper contamination...|$|R
