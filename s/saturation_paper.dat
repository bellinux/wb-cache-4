40|$|On a bi-level colour device, {{only eight}} {{distinct}} colours (including black and white) {{are able to}} be represented. One common method of mapping image data to such a device is to use error diffusion techniques. These techniques diffuse the error from representing a particular pixel to adjacent unprocessed pixels, with the effect that locally the average pixel value closely approximates that of the original image. However, when applied to colour images, the pattern of dots within the three colour planes lose synchronisation, resulting in coloured patterns within regions of low <b>saturation.</b> This <b>paper</b> demonstrates that this problem may be overcome by modulating the threshold level by image intensity.

High power quality operations requires the direct control of injected grid current providing zero steady-state error at grid frequency.
