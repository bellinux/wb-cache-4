We have recently shown that Creb 3 l 1 expression is upregulated by cAMP pathways in vitro, however the exact mechanisms are not known. Here we show that increasing Creb 3 l 1 transcription by raising cAMP levels in mouse pituitary AtT 20 cells automatically initiates cleavage of Creb 3 l 1, leading to a greater abundance of the transcriptionally active N-terminal portion. Inhibiting protein synthesis indicated that de novo protein synthesis of an intermediary transcription factor was required for Creb 3 l 1 induction. <b>Strategic</b> <b>mining</b> of our microarray data from dehydrated rodent hypothalamus revealed four candidates, reduced to two by analysis of acute hyperosmotic-induced transcriptional activation profiles in the hypothalamus, and one, orphan nuclear receptor Nr 4 a 1, by direct shRNA mediated silencing in AtT 20 cells. We show that activation of Creb 3 l 1 transcription by Nr 4 a 1 involves interaction with a single NBRE site in the promoter region. The ability to activate Creb 3 l 1 transcription by this pathway in vitro is dictated by the level of methylation of a CpG island within the proximal promoter/ 5 ′UTR of this gene.

In case of oil sands open-pit mining, further processing of the extracted oil sands generates massive volumes of slurry containing water, sands, clay and fine material known as tailings. Since the tailings volume significantly influences the mine production and site reclamation, it is reasonable to consider tailings management within the frameworks of long-term mine planning. One of the current practices in Alberta oil sands industry is to process the tailings slurry and make composite tailings (CT), through adding coagulant aids to the mature fine tailings (MFT), to accelerate its dewatering and make it ready for reclamation. To save space and also to avoid higher reclamation costs, the processed tailings is deposited in in-pit tailings containments constructed by internal dykes using mine waste material.

40|$|Early <b>strategic</b> <b>mine</b> {{planning}} includes decisions {{over the}} {{organisation of work}} and workforce accommodation. These decisions involve significant commitments that affect not only employee quality of life but also the impacts and relationships with existing local communities. Strategies for workforce accommodation are characteristically community-based (either as purpose-built company towns or integrated within existing local communities) or commuter (fly-in, fly-out) mine camps. The quality of accommodation underpins the fulfilment, morale and motivation of employees. This is not only relevant to productivity and safety, but also to recruitment and retention, particularly with the current onset of a significant human resources crisis. In the event that communities exist in proximity to a proposed mine then the accommodation strategy selected can influence the value-adding potential for the sustainable development of such communities.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the scientific framework underpinning the resource valuation and optimisation model (RVOM). The RVOM is a partial differential equation based real options software package, which helps mine owners optimally plan their operations, understand their project risks, and make defensible valuations. This is {{achieved in the}} presence of both financial and physical uncertainty, as well as processing capacity constraints. The RVOM can be applied to any multi-ore mine, open pit or otherwise, where the block-order of extraction has already been planned using existing software tools such as the Gemcom Whittle™ <b>strategic</b> <b>mine</b> planning package. The RVOM can also take account of multiple commodities within a single mine, and multiple forms of price behaviour. The three key outputs from the RVOM are: valuation, optimal decision and probability of decision. A decision takes account of upfront costs, and can include an unlimited number of transitions between: normal operation, expanded operation, care and maintenance and abandonment (and variants thereof). The RVOM then employs stochastic process theory to determine the probability of reaching these decisions. This gives the mine operators clear indications as to where their risks lie, aiding their mine planning. A clear example of the RVOMs usage to a case-study gold mine is presented, demonstrating its broad applicability, the added value it can create and how users can easily make use of the RVOM’s state-of-the-art algorithmic engine...|$|R

The mine is located in southern part of the country along the border of Peru in a rural region of the Ecuadorian Amazon known for its exceptional biodiversity. Ecuador's economy is heavily dependent upon income from petroleum extraction but the present administration plans to significantly increase mineral extraction. The Mirador project is slated to become the nation's first large-scale open pit mine. Extensive changes to mining laws have been made in order for the state to accumulate more revenue from extraction. Mirador is one of five <b>strategic</b> <b>mines</b> that will be exploited in order to foster national development. Tundayme is home to the indigenous Shuar who had little contact with mestizo settlers from other areas of Ecuador until the 1950 s. Similarly, they were never conquered by the Inca or Spanish. Large-scale, open pit mining represents a significant change in land use from traditional farming and subsistence practices of the Shuar and mestizo populations. Processes of land acquisition for the mine have been irregular and marked changes in water quality have been observed during the initial construction phase. Qualitative methods of observation and interviewing were used to explore residents' experiences related to environmental change and access to natural resources. Identified factors affecting access include direct accumulation of land andnatural resources, as well as dispossession by contamination from perceived mining pollution. Ribot & Peluso's theory of access framework is used to identify a variety of broader mechanisms affecting access and obtain a comprehensive view of the complex local context.

In many cases the smaller mining companies will attack an ore body and will as is called “pick the eyes out” of that specific ore body, thus mining just the high grade ore, make your money and get out. But if it comes to a mine that needs to pro-long the life of the mine due to community responsibility and the creation of work, then it is of essential value to do a technical strategic planning study on the ore body, creating different scenarios as to mine the ore body with emphasis on Life of the mine and in the same breath the economic viability of mining in the chosen scenario. The research report have a look at four different scenarios whereby there are certain constraints applied, and the outcome of the schedules are used to make a calculated decision on the best way of mining this specific ore body. Pit designs have been created from Whittle optimized pitshells which then have been incorporated within the schedules. It has been found that Scenarios 1 and 2 will have some years with very high waste removal, which will be above the current fleet capacity, but the required plant feed and grade would be possible from period one. Scenario 3 have proven that if fleet capacity is the main constraint then steady state of feed to the plant can only be achieved in the 7 th year of production, but render no extra fleet requirements.

40|$|Tactical mine {{planning}} {{is the process}} of determining the sequence and schedule of activities that will best achieve the value generated through the <b>strategic</b> <b>mine</b> plan. These objectives are generally based on the maximisation of Net Present Value (NPV). The scheduling process over both the medium and short term is still largely a manual process as current mathematical optimisation models contain a number of limitations. This is particularly the case for underground mining methods such as sublevel stoping which generally involves selecting production from the next available highest cashflow stope. In most cases, the scheduling problem is too complex to guarantee that the optimal result will be achieved through manual scheduling. The solution to the medium term schedule will traditionally form the starting point from which to commence short term scheduling. Due to the segregation between the two phases only a local optima is possible. While maximising NPV is generally the primary objective of medium term scheduling, short term scheduling tends to focus on value improvements gained through the operational efficiencies resulting from consistently meeting production targets. This thesis describes and presents three mathematical optimisation models utilising mixed integer programming that have been developed for application to new and existing sublevel stoping operations. The locally optimal medium term production scheduling model optimises the production schedule over the medium term by maximising NPV. The locally optimal short term scheduling and machine allocation model generates optimal short term production schedules with all corresponding machine allocations for the purpose of minimising deviation to a target mill feed grade. These models are finally integrated to produce the globally optimal integrated production scheduling model, for the purpose of maximising final NPV while considering each activity across both scheduling horizons. A conceptual sublevel stoping operation comprising of 100 stopes is used for trialling three scheduling approaches incorporating the newly developed models. An initial ‘first pass’ manual scheduling approach achieves an NPV of $ 109, 486, 627. Segregated medium and short term schedule using the newly developed models achieve an NPV of $ 120, 165, 839.

40|$|The {{exploitation}} of open pit deposits usually takes place {{through a series}} of mining phases, commonly known as pushbacks. In open pit metalliferous mining, each pushback considers the extraction of one or more benches simultaneously in a process where the core operational tasks include: drilling, blasting, loading and hauling. In large open pit mines, shovels and front end loaders may be used to carry out loading activities. The type and number of shovels are selected during the planning process and their productivity determines the mining rate of the benches, pushbacks and the mine. The space available for loading is part of the pushback design. This defines the shape and size of the benches where the equipment will be placed. A relevant stage in mine design is the definition of the location and sequence that loading equipment must follow to deplete the benches of each pushback. The deployment of loading equipment in the mine is commonly referred to the scheme of exploitation. This term is widely used in the mining industry but not frequently referenced in the literature. The objective {{of this paper is to}} explore the concept of the scheme of exploitation in open pit mining within the context of the <b>strategic</b> <b>mine</b> planning activity. In the first part, the concept is presented through examples where the pushback size is fixed and the number of shovel is changed. The second part includes a discussion of the motivations and constraints that the mine planner may consider in the design. Configurations with several shovels and benches in a same pushback represent a challenge for the scheme design mainly due to the limitation of space for loading. Mathematical and optimisation tools can be useful in these cases; however, the models have to be able to represent the real constraints that will affect the productivity of the shovels in the different levels. In general, aggressive and costly schemes are rarely used by mining companies that seek high performance levels and lower operating costs. However, the selection of an appropriate scheme of exploitation needs to be aligned with the principal objective of the mine planning activity, which is to: create value through the {{exploitation of}} a mineral resource...|$|R
