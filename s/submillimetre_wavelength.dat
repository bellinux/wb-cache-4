The process steps involved are clean-ing, device isolation, passivation, ohmic contacts, thick metal, air-bridge formation, transfer of EPI-layers to copper substrate, and formation of mechanical {{support for the}} whisker. These fabrication steps are described in detail. The characterisation techniques of HBVs are described in detail.

40|$|Abstract. We discuss {{preliminary}} results from our programme {{to map the}} fields of high-redshift AGN. In {{the context of the}} hierarchical models such fields are predicted to contain an over-density of young, luminous galaxies destined to evolve into the core of a rich cluster by the present epoch. We have thus imaged from submillimetre to X-ray wavelengths the few-arcmin scale fields of a small sample of high-redshift QSOs. We find that <b>submillimetre</b> <b>wavelength</b> data from SCUBA show striking over-densities of luminous star-forming galaxies over scales of ∼ 500 kpc. Whilst many of these galaxies are undetected even in deep near-IR imaging almost all of them are detected by Spitzer at 4. 5, 8. 0 and 24 µm, showing that they have extremely red colours. However, they are not detected in our XMM-Newton observations suggesting that any AGN must be highly obscured. Optical-through-mid-IR SEDs show the redshifted 1. 6 µm bump from star-light giving preliminary evidence that the galaxies lie at the same redshift, and thus in the same structure, as the QSO although this finding must be confirmed with photometric and/or spectroscopic redshifts. 1...|$|E
