5|$|A <b>somewhat</b> <b>different</b> {{design of}} cutting tool that can achieve the {{irregular}} hole or outer {{profile of a}} broach is called a rotary broach or wobble broach. One of the biggest advantages {{to this type of}} broaching {{is that it does not}} require a broaching machine, but instead is used on lathes, milling machines, screw machines or Swiss lathes.|$|E
5|$|The quarks {{are held}} {{together}} by the strong interaction (or strong force), which is mediated by gluons. The protons and neutrons, in turn, are held {{to each other in}} the nucleus by the nuclear force, which is a residuum of the strong force that has <b>somewhat</b> <b>different</b> range-properties (see the article on the nuclear force for more). The gluon is a member of the family of gauge bosons, which are elementary particles that mediate physical forces.|$|E

5|$|Treatment {{recommendations}} for children are <b>somewhat</b> <b>different</b> from those for adults. The World Health Organization recommends treating all children less than 5 years of age; children above 5 are treated like adults. The United States guidelines recommend treating all children less than 12 {{months of age}} and all those with HIV RNA counts greater than 100,000copies/mL between one year and five years of age.|$|E
5|$|German war cemeteries are <b>somewhat</b> <b>different</b> from French and British ones, {{being more}} austere and simple in design. They were built around lawns, without flowers or other decorations, {{intended}} to highlight {{acceptance of the}} tragedy and avoid the expensive and pretentious sentimentality that the German VDK felt Allied cemeteries invoked. German war cemeteries also included heldenhaine, heroes' groves populated with oak trees and large boulders, dolmen. Both symbolising nature; this landscaping {{was considered to be}} particularly important for German war cemeteries. The cemeteries used slate grave markers, less individualised than British or French equivalents, and felt to better symbolise the importance German nation as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Since 1998, an American botanist, Austin Mast, {{has been}} {{publishing}} results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence {{data for the}} subtribe Banksiinae. His analyses suggest a phylogeny that is very greatly different from George's arrangement, and <b>somewhat</b> <b>different</b> from Thiele and Ladiges'. With respect to B.violacea, Mast's results agree with its placement near B.laricina and B.incana, placing it in a clade with these two species and B.sphaerocarpa var. dolichostyla (treated at species rank as B.dolichostyla). However, Thiele's B. subseries Longistyles appears to be polyphyletic, as do both definitions of B.ser. Abietinae—that is, none form a natural grouping.|$|E

5000|$|The {{story of}} Oenopion’s {{daughter}} differs <b>somewhat</b> in <b>different</b> ancient sources. The Hunter Orion married a lovely woman called Side {{and when she}} was punished by Hera, he walked to Chios over the Aegean, and Oenopion welcomed him with a banquet.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{outbreak}} of the Greyhawk Wars, Robilar returned to the dungeons underneath Greyhawk Castle, where he encountered a potent artifact called the Orb of Opposition, which swapped him with a <b>somewhat</b> ideologically <b>different</b> double from an alternate Oerth called Uerth, named Bilarro.|$|R
5|$|The Mahavira's teachings were {{gradually}} lost after around 300BC, {{according to}} the Jain tradition, when a severe famine in the Magadha region of ancient India caused a scattering of the Jain monks. Thereafter, attempts were made by Jain monks to gather again, co-recite the canon, and re-establish it in its entirety. These efforts identified differences between recitations of the Mahavira's teachings, and {{an attempt was made}} in the 5thcentury AD to reconcile the differences. However, the reconciliation efforts failed, with Svetambara and Digambara Jain traditions continuing with their own incomplete, <b>somewhat</b> <b>different</b> versions of the Mahavira's teachings. In the early centuries of the common era, Jain texts containing Mahavira's teachings were written down in palm leaf manuscripts.|$|E
5|$|A <b>somewhat</b> <b>different</b> DAG-based {{formulation}} of scheduling constraints {{is used by}} the program evaluation and review technique (PERT), a method for management of large human projects {{that was one of the}} first applications of DAGs. In this method, the vertices of a DAG represent milestones of a project rather than specific tasks to be performed. Instead, a task or activity is represented by an edge of a DAG, connecting two milestones that mark the beginning and completion of the task. Each such edge is labeled with an estimate for the amount of time that it will take a team of workers to perform the task. The longest path in this DAG represents the critical path of the project, the one that controls the total time for the project. Individual milestones can be scheduled according to the lengths of the longest paths ending at their vertices.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{have been}} {{expressed}} {{that the use}} of explicit-constant definitions of the unit being defined that are not related to an example of its quantity will have many adverse effects. Although this criticism applies to the proposed linking of the kilogram to the Planck constant via a route that requires a knowledge of both special relativity and quantum mechanics, it does not apply to the proposed definition of the ampere, which is closer to an example of its quantity than is the current definition. Some observers have welcomed the proposal to base the definition of electric current on the charge of the electron rather than the current definition of a force between two parallel current-carrying wires – since the nature of the electromagnetic interaction between two bodies at the quantum electrodynamics level is <b>somewhat</b> <b>different</b> from the nature at classical electrodynamic levels, it is considered inappropriate to use classical electrodynamics to define quantities that exist at quantum electrodynamic levels.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, two less {{powerful}} T single-car units were built, {{designed to be}} prototypes used on the Oslo Tramway. After a one-year trial, they were put into scheduled traffic to the Kolsås Line, where they remained in regular service until 1983. The production series is <b>somewhat</b> <b>different</b> in design and performance. T1000 is both {{used to refer to}} the class as a whole, or the first 162 cars, that are only equipped with third-rail shoes. They have four slight variations, which have been given the designations T1–T4. The T1300 is a series of 33 new and sixteen rebuilt T4 trains equipped with pantographs which previously allowed them operate on {{the western part of the}} network, prior to it being upgraded to third-rail metro standards. The newer units were designated T5 and T6, while the rebuilt units were designated T7 and T8.|$|E
5|$|In eastern Europe, Romania built {{what were}} termed heroes' war grave cemeteries, either in {{existing}} heroes' cemeteries, on {{the sites of}} the World War I battles, or in new cemeteries symbolically placed {{on the edges of}} towns. The situation was <b>somewhat</b> <b>different</b> in Russia, however, where the Moscow City Fraternal Cemetery was used not just for the war dead of World War I, but also for the casualties of the Civil War, and then the victims of the secret police. It was finally closed by the Bolsheviks in 1925 and turned into a park; subsequently, possibly on the orders of Joseph Stalin, the Eastern Orthodox church and the headstones were systematically destroyed until almost no trace of the cemetery remained.|$|E
5|$|Factors {{required}} {{for the formation of}} medicanes are <b>somewhat</b> <b>different</b> than that normally expected of tropical cyclones; known to emerge over regions with sea surface temperatures (SSTs) below , Mediterranean tropical cyclones often require incursions of colder air to induce atmospheric instability. A majority of medicanes develop above regions of the Mediterranean with SSTs of , with the upper bound only found in the southernmost reaches of the sea. Despite the low sea surface temperatures, the instability incited by cold atmospheric air within a baroclinic zone—regions with high differences in temperature and pressure—permits the formation of medicanes, in contrast to tropical areas lacking high baroclinity, where raised SSTs are needed. While significant deviations in air temperature have been noted around the time of Mediterranean tropical cyclones' formation, few anomalies in sea surface temperature coincide with their development, indicating that the formation of medicanes is primarily controlled by higher air temperatures, not by anomalous SSTs. Similar to tropical cyclones, minimal wind shear—difference in wind speed and direction over a region—as well as abundant moisture and vorticity encourages the genesis of tropical cyclone-like systems in the Mediterranean Sea.|$|E

50|$|The {{coefficient}} {{of the port}} may change <b>somewhat</b> at <b>different</b> pressure differentials due to changes in Reynolds number regime leading to a possible loss of dynamic similitude.Flow bench test pressure are typically conducted at 10 to 28 inches of water (2.5 to 7 kPa) while a real engine may see 190 inches of water (47 kPa) pressure difference.|$|R
5|$|Parasites {{can also}} be {{aggressive}} mimics, though the situation is <b>somewhat</b> <b>different</b> from those outlined previously. Some predators have a feature that draws prey; parasites can also mimic their host's natural prey, but are eaten themselves, a pathway into their host. Leucochloridium, a genus of flatworm, matures in the digestive system of songbirds, their eggs then passing out of the bird in the faeces. They are then taken up by Succinea, a terrestrial snail. The eggs develop in this intermediate host, and must then find a suitable bird to mature in. Since the host birds do not eat snails, the sporocyst has another strategy to reach its host's intestine. They are brightly coloured and move in a pulsating fashion. A sporocyst-sac pulsates in the snail's eye stalks, coming to resemble an irresistible meal for a songbird. In this way, it can {{bridge the gap between}} hosts, allowing it to complete its life cycle. A nematode (Myrmeconema neotropicum) changes the colour of the abdomen of workers of the canopy ant Cephalotes atratus to make it appear like the ripe fruits of Hyeronima alchorneoides. It also changes the behaviour of the ant so that the gaster (rear part) is held raised. This presumably increases the chances of the ant being eaten by birds. The droppings of birds are collected by other ants and fed to their brood, thereby helping to spread the nematode.|$|E
5|$|The {{novelisation}} and the screenplay, {{although both}} written by Wood, are <b>somewhat</b> <b>different.</b> In the novelisation, SMERSH is still active and after James Bond. Their role begins during the pre-title. After the mysterious death of Fekkish, SMERSH appears yet again, this time capturing and torturing Bond for {{the whereabouts of}} the microfilm that retains plans for a submarine tracking system (Bond escapes after killing two of the interrogators). The appearance of SMERSH conflicts {{with a number of}} Bond stories, including the film The Living Daylights (1987), in which a character remarks that SMERSH has been defunct for over 20 years. It also differs from the latter half of Fleming's Bond novels in which SMERSH {{is said to have been}} put out of operation. Members of SMERSH from the novelisation include Amasova and her lover Sergei Borzov as well as Colonel-General Niktin, a character from Fleming's novel From Russia, with Love who has since become the head of SMERSH. In the book, Jaws remains attached to the magnet that Bond dips into the tank, as opposed to the film where Bond releases Jaws into the water.|$|E
5|$|Angela and Serah {{then headed}} to Castle Caldecote in Cumberland {{as it was}} the {{whereabouts}} of the third Faustian. Her name was Anna Maria, the natural daughter of a bishop that was kept safe by Master Coulson in one of the castle's room as instructed by her father. However, in the last new moon, she managed to escape the castle and returned <b>somewhat</b> <b>different.</b> Seeing the girl was not mad as Coulson said she was, Serah demanded the girl to be freed from her chains and told Angela {{to keep an eye on}} her. As the days passed, Serah, who had been studying about the Faerie, discovered that the Enchantress sends a sliver of herself into each of those with whom she struck a deal and that she was using stories, such as that of her victims and Christopher Marlowe's play, to expand her power. Upon figuring it out, Serah started to devise a plan to counter that of Enchantress. Meanwhile, Angela struck a deal with Anna Maria: in exchange for a way to free her, she would tell Angela the truth about herself. The girl then told her she was born Witchbreed and that she eventually learned her touch was death. When the path to the Faerie was open, she took the opportunity to become something other than what she was, and willingly struck a deal with the Enchantress and became a Faustian. Later that night, Angela heard strange noises coming from Anna Maria's room and went to check if everything was right. There she found the girl crying, frightened by the Enchantress' voice inside her head. The girl asked Angela to tell her a story to calm her down, and so she did, but it was in vain as the Enchantress took control of the girl's body and attacked Angela. The girl managed to regain consciousness though and in an attempt to be free again, used Angela's weapon to kill herself. Serah showed up and was able to revive the girl, who was a Faustian no more. As she hadn't died, Serah thought she was safe from the Enchantress' wrath, but she was wrong as the Faerie rose from the blood of her lost Faustian and took Serah's life, fulfilling her menace. With the sun setting, Angela burned her lover's body to the ashes, recovering her skull and singing to it afterwards. Suddenly to Angela's surprise, the skull became animated and started to talk with her.|$|E
