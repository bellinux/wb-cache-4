500|$|During {{her final}} years, Dworkin {{suffered}} fragile health, and she revealed {{in her last}} column for the Guardian {{that she had been}} weakened and nearly crippled {{for the past several years}} by severe osteoarthritis in the knees. Shortly after returning from Paris in 1999, she had been hospitalized with a high fever and blood clots in her legs. A few months after being released from the hospital, she became increasingly unable to bend her knees, and underwent surgery to replace her knees with titanium and plastic prosthetics. She wrote, [...] "The doctor who knows me best says that osteoarthritis begins long before it cripples [...] in my case, possibly from homelessness, or sexual abuse, or beatings on my legs, or my weight. John, my partner, blames Scapegoat, a study of Jewish identity and women's liberation that took me nine years to write; it is, he says, the book that <b>stole</b> <b>my</b> health. I blame the drug-rape that I experienced in 1999 in Paris." ...|$|E
500|$|Two remixes of [...] "Juxtapozed with U" [...] are {{included}} on the DVD version of Rings Around The World. The first, by the Super Furry Animals themselves, is 3 minutes 23 seconds in length and largely follows {{the arrangement of the}} original with lengthy instrumental passages between each verse and chorus. Electronic drums and keyboards play alongside Gruff Rhys's vocals with barely any recognisable instrumentation from the version of the track which appears on Rings Around the World. The second remix by Lesser is 3 minutes 22 seconds long and begins with a short sample of Rhys singing the words [...] "All the people that you hate" [...] before breaking down to finger clicking and clapping. Rhys's vocals enter again, singing the title phrase, before samples of the original's string section and drums enter at 1 minute 11 seconds. The rest of the track continues with Rhys's vocals backed by disjointed drum and string samples, breaking down towards the end to just the lead vocals and a harp. The remix ends with Rhys singing the line [...] "Til someone <b>stole</b> <b>my</b> name" [...] a cappella.|$|E

2500|$|In late 1964, Gouldman {{dissolved}} the Whirlwinds, and in February 1965, {{formed the}} Mockingbirds with Jacobson and Basso {{and a former}} member of fellow Manchester band the Sabres, Kevin Godley (drums). The Mockingbirds signed with the Columbia label, which rejected Gouldman's first offering as a single – [...] "For Your Love" [...] (later a major hit for the Yardbirds) – and issued two singles, [...] "That's How (It's Gonna Stay)" [...] (February 1965, also issued in the US on ABC Paramount) and [...] "I Can Feel We're Parting" [...] (May 1965). The band switched to the Immediate label for [...] "You <b>Stole</b> <b>My</b> Love" [...] (October 1965) and Decca for [...] "One By One" [...] (July 1966) and [...] "How to Find a Lover" [...] (October 1966) ...|$|E

2500|$|As well as {{recording}} and appearing {{on radio and}} in clubs, Thomas continued {{to work as a}} boiler operator in the textile plant, where he claimed the noises sometimes suggested musical rhythms and lyrics to him, before he finally gave up the job in 1963, to focus on his role as a singer and entertainer. [...] He recorded a series of novelty dance tracks, including [...] "Can Your Monkey Do the Dog'" [...] and '"Somebody <b>Stole</b> <b>My</b> Dog" [...] for Stax, where he was often backed by Booker T. & the MGs or the Bar-Kays. [...] He also became a mentor to younger Stax stars, giving advice on stage moves to performers like Otis Redding, who partnered daughter Carla on record.|$|E
2500|$|... 1925 {{was a major}} {{turning point}} in Kern's career when he met Oscar Hammerstein II, with whom he would {{entertain}} a lifelong friendship and collaboration. As a young man, Kern had been an easy companion with great charm and humor, but he became less outgoing in his middle years, sometimes difficult to work with: he once introduced himself to a producer by saying, [...] "I hear you're {{a son of a}} bitch. [...] So am I." [...] He rarely collaborated with any one lyricist for long. [...] With Hammerstein, however, he remained on close terms {{for the rest of his}} life. [...] Their first show, written together with Harbach, was Sunny, which featured the song [...] "Who (<b>Stole</b> <b>My</b> Heart Away)?" [...] Marilyn Miller played the title role, as she had in Sally. [...] The show ran for 517 performances on Broadway, and the following year ran for 363 performances in the West End, starring Binnie Hale and Jack Buchanan.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2000, Geller sued {{video game}} company Nintendo for £60 {{million over the}} Pokémon species [...] "", {{localized}} in English as [...] "Kadabra", which he claimed was an unauthorized appropriation of his identity. The Pokémon in question has psychic abilities and carries a bent spoon. Geller also claimed that the star on Kadabra's forehead and the lightning patterns on its abdomen are symbolisms popular with the Waffen SS of Nazi Germany. [...] The katakana for the character's name, ユンゲラー, is visually similar to the transliteration of Geller's own name into Japanese (ユリゲラー). [...] He is quoted as saying: [...] "Nintendo turned me into an evil, occult Pokémon character. Nintendo <b>stole</b> <b>my</b> identity by using my name and my signature image." [...] As of 2008 the situation was still ongoing. Pokémon anime director and storyboard artist Masamitsu Hidaka confirmed {{in an interview that}} Kadabra would not be used on a Pokémon Trading Card until an agreement was reached on the case. As of 2017, the agreement has not been reached and the last Kadabra card released was in the Skyridge e-Reader set.|$|E
2500|$|John Serba of AllMusic {{said that}} Orchid was [...] "quite an audacious release, a far-beyond-epic prog/death monstrosity exuding equal parts beauty and brutality– an album so brilliant, so navel-gazingly pretentious that, in retrospect, Opeth's future greatness was a foregone conclusion". John Chedsey of Satan <b>Stole</b> <b>My</b> Teddybear {{stated that the}} album is [...] "one of the more {{stunning}} and devastatingly powerful debuts of any metal band in any genre." [...] Jim Raggi of Lamentations of the Flame Princess wrote that [...] "perhaps the most easily recognizable voice in all of extreme metal, Mikael Åkerfeldt really does make some noise in his debut. I can't think of very many vocalists in 1994 (when the album was recorded) who used both clean and growled vocals freely. I'm definitely {{not going to go}} so far as to say he was the first (Dan Swanö did beat him on that at least!) but all those years ago, Åkerfeldt did set the standard for what the extreme progressive music vocalist should sound like". He added, [...] "The fact is this album is a groundbreaking milestone in heavy metal for the progressive elements that are thrown into the more metallic music and the extreme vocals" [...] and the sound of the album is [...] "completely unique". Chris Dick of Decibel stated in Precious Metal: Decibel Presents the Stories Behind 25 Extreme Metal Masterpieces: ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} well-received critically. Vincent Eldefors of Tartarean Desire stated [...] "ever since I first heard my first Opeth song [...] "To Bid You Farewell"... {{they have been}} among my {{favorite}} bands". [...] "Dan Swanö helped record this epic piece", said John Chedsey of Satan <b>Stole</b> <b>My</b> Teddybear in his review, and also mentioned that [...] "generally the songs flow well from one part to the next, though individual songs are not immediately noticeable. The twin guitars work well with each other, creating some great melodies in the guitars, and often lasping into very tasteful acoustic moods. In my opinion, it's difficult to write on guitar intricate songs that fully involve the listener, but Opeth manages to keep your attention." [...] Murat Batmaz of Sea of Tranquility wrote that [...] "the melodies, both on this song [...] and the entire album, are immortal." [...] He also wrote, [...] "Though I prefer their current lineup, I don't believe Morningrise {{would have been so}} amazing without Johan De Farfalla and Anders Nordin adding their touches. They both incorporate subtle jazz harmonies in their playing enriching the psychedelic passages on the album." [...] He was also impressed with the guitar riffs, saying [...] "it is almost shocking how many godlike riffs Opeth are using in their songs. They literally employ tens of changing riff patterns and incomparable melodies on a single track, with which other bands could more than likely write two full albums" [...] and claimed that the song [...] "Black Rose Immortal" [...] is a [...] "magnum opus".|$|E

2500|$|When Dulness chooses her new king, she {{settles on}} Bays, who {{is seen in}} his study {{surveying}} his own works: [...] "Nonsense precipitate, like running Lead,/ That slip'd thro' Cracks and Zig-zags of the Head" [...] (I 123–4) and [...] "Next, o'er his Books his eyes began to roll,/ In pleasing memory of all he stole" [...] (B I 127–8). [...] The base of Cibber's pile of sacrificed books is several commonplace books, which are the basis of all his own productions. Although Cibber confesses [...] "Some Daemon <b>stole</b> <b>my</b> pen... And once betray'd me into common sense," [...] he prays to Dulness for inspiration, insisting that [...] "Else all my Prose and Verse were much the same;/ This, prose on stilts; that, poetry fall'n lame" [...] (I 187–90). The accidental common sense was The Careless Husband. [...] When Cibber casts about for new professions, he, unlike Theobald in 1732, decides, [...] "Hold-to the Minister I more incline;/ To serve his cause, O Queen! is serving thine" [...] (I 213–4). The [...] "minister" [...] is Robert Walpole, an extremely unpopular Whig leader, and the [...] "queen" [...] is both Dulness and Queen Caroline of Hanover, who was a Tory enemy for her reconciliation of George II with Walpole. When the new king is about to burn his books in despair, Pope heightens the religious imagery, for Cibber says to his books, [...] "Unstain'd, untouch'd, and yet in maiden sheets;/ While all your smutty sisters walk the streets" [...] (I 229–30), and it is better that they be burned than that they be wrapped in [...] "Oranges, to pelt your Sire" [...] (I 236). Again, Dulness extinguishes the pyre with a sheet of the ever-wet Thule.|$|E
