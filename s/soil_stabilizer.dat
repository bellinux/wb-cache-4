25|$|Elements {{of concern}} to the area are fire, over- or under-grazing, native species reintroduction, human {{recreational}} (camping and hunting) and educational/scientific use, resource exploration, linear development, and invasive species. Invasive species, primarily weeds, are a significant threat that crowd out native plant species and reduce habitat and food sources for native animals, birds, fish, and insects. Weeds are quick colonizers that often move into an area disturbed by fire or human activity. Linear developments such as roads, pipelines, and powerlines often provide a vector for invasive species to enter new areas. Because of their rapid and opportunistic spread, weeds also often lack the deep root system of native plants and thus contribute to bank instability and soil erosion. The nodding thistle weed (Carduus nutans) was discovered {{in the area in}} 2006. Several other weed species have been found in the natural area, including the highly aggressive downy brome (Bromus tectorum), creeping meadow foxtail (Alopecurus arundinaceus), crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum), and Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia). Several of these species have invaded from across the U.S. border into Canada. Formerly utilized as a reclamation species, crested wheatgrass has had detrimental effects on soil and grazing. Russian olive, imported as a <b>soil</b> <b>stabilizer,</b> windbreak, and ornamental, reduces biodiversity of riparian areas.|$|E

50|$|Hydrogel {{swelling}} of biopolymers reduces {{the amount of}} soil pore space, restricting {{the flow of water}} and suiting polymer hydrogels for construction projects seeking to minimize water seepage and support vegetation growth. Biopolymers can be added to soils along with synthetic polymers to utilize the properties of both polymers. By increasing the water retention and infiltration rates in soils, the addition of biopolymers increases the availability of water for plants. This is particularly applicable in arid regions like deserts where droughts leave soils susceptible to high rates of erosion during precipitation events. By retaining water, the enhanced soils reduce runoff and its accompanying erosion. PAM has been widely applied as a <b>soil</b> <b>stabilizer</b> for agriculture, both to retain water in fields and to improve run-off water quality by reducing the amount of sediment entering rivers and streams.|$|E

Only a few teeth are cutting at one time and this pattern of teeth placement also serves to auger the material to the centre where it can be picked up easily by a conveyor belt.|$|E
50|$|Although it {{may have}} arrived by ship {{as early as the}} 16th century, C. edulis was {{actively}} introduced in the early 1900s to stabilize dunes and soil along railroad tracks; it was later put to use by Caltrans for ground cover along freeway embankments. Thousands of acres were planted in California until the 1970s. It easily spreads by seed (hundreds per fruit) and from segmentation (any shoot segment can produce roots). Its succulent foliage, bright magenta or yellow flowers, and resistance to some harsh coastal climatic conditions (salt) have also made it a favored garden plant. The ice plant was, for several decades, widely promoted as an ornamental plant, and it is still available at some nurseries. Ice plant foliage can turn a vibrant red to yellow in color. Despite its use as a <b>soil</b> <b>stabilizer,</b> it actually exacerbates and speeds up coastal erosion. It holds great masses of water in its leaves, and its roots are very shallow. In the rainy season, the added weight on unstable sandstone slopes and dunes increases the chances of slope collapse and landslides.|$|E

This paper is a review of research and development as-sociated with application, methods, and amounts of mulch types-crop residues, chemical <b>soil</b> <b>stabilizers,</b> and feedlot wastes (manure) -required to control wind erosion. An effective wind erosion control treatment is one that can resist a 38. 0 m/s wind as measured at 15. 2 m. Any crop residue, either grown in place or hauled in and spread, can control wind erosion. Hauled-in residues must be spread and anchored to the soil surface by a packer or an anchoring agent, Le., cutback asphalt or asphalt emulsion. Depending on residue type, minimum amounts needed to control wind erosion are 4. 5 to 11 t/ha.
