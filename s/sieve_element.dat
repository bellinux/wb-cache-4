40|$|In Fabaceae, {{dispersion}} of forisomes—highly ordered aggregates of <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> proteins—in response to phytoplasma infection was proposed to limit phloem mass flow and, hence, prevent pathogen spread. In this study, {{the involvement of}} filamentous <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> proteins in the containment of phytoplasmas was investigated in non-Fabaceae plants. Healthy and infected Arabidopsis plants lacking one or two genes related to <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> filament formation—AtSEOR 1 (At 3 g 01680), AtSEOR 2 (At 3 g 01670), and AtPP 2 -A 1 (At 4 g 19840) —were analysed. TEM images revealed that phytoplasma infection induces phloem protein filament formation in both the wild-type and mutant lines.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Botany, Washington State UniversityThe {{distribution}} of photosynthetically derived assimilates through plants occurs in specialized cells called sieve {{elements that are}} connected to each other forming a microfluidic system within the plant. Sieve elements were discovered over 150 years ago, however their in vivo structure and complete assimilate transport properties eludes clarification. Microscopic investigation of sieve elements requires tissue manipulations that disrupt the natural state of translocating sieve elements resulting in interpretations of <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> ultrastructure. Construed <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> structures accommodate the osmotic pressure flow hypothesis. Assimilates are postulated to passively flow through sieve elements {{as a result of}} osmotically generated pressure differences from source to sink. The assimilate stream characteristics are considered to adhere to physical parameters of the <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> geometry. For this theory to hold the sieve elements must be free major of obstructions. Presented below is a five year compilation on the investigations on <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> structure and how the structure may relate to function. Cell wall geometries of the sieve elements were investigated with newly developed microscopy methods and the geometries were compared to phloem flow, implicating that phloem flow may not adhere to the dogma of osmotic pressure flow hypothesis. <b>Sieve</b> <b>element</b> occlusion mechanisms were also reviewed and investigated. <b>Sieve</b> <b>element</b> occlusion related proteins were investigated by means of newly developed microscopic methodologies.

In some <b>sieve</b> <b>elements</b> the P-protein bodies fail to disperse. The {{occurrence of}} dispersal or nondispersal of P-protein bodies {{can be related}} to the position of the <b>sieve</b> <b>elements</b> in the stem or petiole.

The appearance of the sieve plate in fixed material is related to the degree of dispersal or nondispersal of the P-protein bodies.

To this end, microelectrodes were inserted into free-lying phloem cells in the main vein of the youngest fully-expanded leaf, half-way along the stem, in the transition zone between the autotrophic and heterotrophic part of the stem, and in the root axis. A top-to-bottom membrane potential gradient of <b>sieve</b> <b>elements</b> was observed along the stem (- 130 mV to - 110 mV), while the membrane potential of the phloem parenchyma cells was stable (approx. - 100 mV). In roots, the membrane potential of <b>sieve</b> <b>elements</b> dropped abruptly to - 55 mV. Bathing solutions having various sucrose concentrations were administered and sucrose/H+-induced depolarisations were recorded. Data analysis by nonlinear least-square data fittings as well as by linear Eadie-Hofstee (EH) -transformations pointed at biphasic Michaelis-Menten kinetics (2 MM, EH: Km 1 1. 2 - 1. 8 mM, Km 2 6. 6 - 9. 0 mM) of sucrose uptake by <b>sieve</b> <b>elements.</b> However, Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) favoured single MM kinetics. Using single MM as the best-fitting model, Km values for sucrose uptake by <b>sieve</b> <b>elements</b> decreased along the plant axis from 1 to 7 mM. For phloem parenchyma cells, higher Km values (EH: Km 1 10 mM, Km 2 70 mM) as compared to <b>sieve</b> <b>elements</b> were found. In preliminary patch-clamp experiments with sieve-element protoplasts, small sucrose-coupled proton currents (- 0. 1 to - 0. 3 pA/ pF) were detected in the whole-cell mode.

40|$|To {{protect against}} loss of photo-assimilate-rich phloem sap, plants have evolved several {{mechanisms}} to plug phloem sieve tubes {{in response to}} damage. In many Fabaceae, each <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> contains a discrete proteinaceous body called a forisome, which, in response to damage, rapidly transforms from a condensed configuration that does not impede the flow of sap to a dispersed configuration that plugs the <b>sieve</b> <b>element.</b> Aphids and other specialized phloem sap feeders can ingest phloem sap from a single <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> for hours or days, and to do this, they {{must be able to}} suppress or reverse phloem plugging. A recent study provided in vitro evidence that aphid saliva can reverse forisome plugs. The present study tested this hypothesis in vivo by inducing forisome plugs which triggered aphids to switch behaviour from phloem sap ingestion to salivation into the <b>sieve</b> <b>element.</b> After salivating into the <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> for various periods of time, the aphids were instantaneously cryofixed (freeze fixed) in situ on their leaf. The state of the forisome was then determined in the penetrated <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> and in nearby non-penetrated sieve elements which served as controls for sieve elements not subjected to direct aphid salivation. Forisomes were almost always in close contact with the stylet tips and thus came into direct contact with the saliva. Nonetheless, forisome plugs in the penetrated <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> did not revert back to a non-plugging state any faster than those in neighbouring sieve elements that were not subjected to direct aphid salivation. © The Author 2013.

40|$|The phloem {{performs}} essential systemic {{functions in}} tracheophytes, yet {{little is known}} about its molecular genetic specification. Here we show that application of the peptide ligand CLAVATA 3 /EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION 45 (CLE 45) specifically inhibits specification of protophloem in Arabidopsis roots by locking the <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> precursor cell in its preceding developmental state. CLE 45 treatment, as well as viable transgenic expression of a weak CLE 45 (G 6 T) variant, interferes not only with commitment to <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> fate but also with the formative <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> precursor cell division that creates protophloem and metaphloem cell files. However, the absence of this division appears to be a secondary effect of discontinuous <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> files and subsequent systemically reduced auxin signaling in the root meristem. In the absence of the formative <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> precursor cell division, metaphloem identity is seemingly adopted by the normally procambial cell file instead, pointing to possibly independent positional cues for metaphloem formation. The protophloem formation and differentiation defects in brevis radix (brx) and octopus (ops) mutants are similar to those observed in transgenic seedlings with increased CLE 45 activity and can be rescued by loss of function of a putative CLE 45 receptor, BARELY ANY MERISTEM 3 (BAM 3). Conversely, a dominant gain-of-function ops allele or mild OPS dosage increase suppresses brx defects and confers CLE 45 resistance. Thus, our data suggest that delicate quantitative interplay between the opposing activities of BAM 3 -mediated CLE 45 signals and OPS-dependent signals determines cellular commitment to protophloem <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> fate, with OPS acting as a positive, quantitative master regulator of phloem fate...|$|E

This is the first attempt to study the feeding behavior differences between biotype 1 and biotype 2 on soybean genotypes using the Electrical Penetration Graph technique, and includes both resistant and susceptible soybean genotypes from Kansas and Michigan.

Ultrastructural cytochemistry employing two carbohydrases specific for different linkages was {{then used to}} compare the chemical nature of "sieve tube starch" (the starch deposited in sieve elements) with that of the ordinary starch of other cell types. Hypocotyl tissue from seedlings was fixed in glutaraldehyde, postfixed in osmium tetroxide, and embedded in Epon-Araldite. Treatment of thin sections on uncoated copper grids with α-amylase or diastase at pH 6. 8 to cleave α-(1 → 4) bonds resulted in digestion of ordinary starch grains but not <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> grains, as determined by electron microscopy.

Pullulanase did not digest <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> starch, but rendered the starch digestible subsequently by α-amylase. Diastase followed by pullulanase did not result in digestion.

Reorganisation of the fibrillar P-protein into the tubular form also seems to take place in the larger P-protein bodies. In negatively-stained preparations, a suggestion of a tightening of the double helix of the P-protein fibrils is discernible. This reorganisation is however not consistent. The usual banding of the fibrillar P-protein is prominent. Most of the mature sieve plates show occluded pores either callosed or not. The P-protein frequently appears to fray out on the downstream side and sometimes on the upstream side as well. This has a bearing on the nature of functioning sieve plates and {{does not seem to be}} due to artifacts. Empty spaces which represent probably a peculiar artifact are observed immediately above most of the mature sieve plates.

Development of novel control {{strategies}} can be facilitated by comparison of BPH feeding behaviour on varieties exhibiting natural genetic variation, and then elucidation of the underlying mechanisms of resistance. Methodology/Principal Findings: BPH feeding behaviour was compared on 12 rice varieties over a 12 h period using the electrical penetration graph (EPG) and honeydew clocks. Seven feeding behaviours (waveforms) were identified and could be classified into two phases. The first phase involved patterns of <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> location including non penetration (NP), pathway (N 1 +N 2 +N 3), xylem (N 5) [21] and two new feeding waveforms, derailed stylet mechanics (N 6) and cell penetration (N 7). The second feeding phase consisted of salivation into the <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> (N 4 -a) and <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> sap ingestion (N 4 -b). Production of honeydew drops correlated with N 4 -b waveform patterns providing independent confirmation of this feeding behaviour. Conclusions/Significance: Overall variation in feeding behaviour was highly correlated with previously published field resistance or susceptibility of the different rice varieties: BPH produced lower numbers of honeydew drops and had a shorter period of phloem feeding on resistant rice varieties, {{but there was no}} significant difference in the time to the first salivation (N 4 -b). These qualitative differences in behaviour suggest that resistance is caused by differences in sustaine...|$|E

40|$|The {{pressure}} flow model of phloem transport envisaged by M&# 252;nch (1930) has gained wide acceptance. Recently, however, the {{model has been}} questioned on structural and physiological grounds. For instance, sub-structures of <b>sieve</b> <b>elements</b> may reduce their hydraulic conductances to levels that impede flow rates of phloem sap and observed magnitudes of pressure gradients to drive flow along sieve tubes could be inadequate in tall trees. A variant of the M&# 252;nch {{pressure flow}} model, the high-pressure manifold model of phloem transport introduced by Donald Fisher may serve to reconcile {{at least some of}} these questions. To this end, key predicted features of the high-pressure manifold model of phloem transport are evaluated against current knowledge of the physiology of phloem transport. These features include: (1) An absence of significant gradients in axial hydrostatic pressure in <b>sieve</b> <b>elements</b> from collection to release phloem accompanied by transport properties of <b>sieve</b> <b>elements</b> that underpin this outcome; (2) Symplasmic pathways of phloem unloading into sink organs impose a major constraint over bulk flow rates of resources translocated through the source-path-sink system; (3) Hydraulic conductances of plasmodesmata, linking <b>sieve</b> <b>elements</b> with surrounding phloem parenchyma cells, are sufficient to support and also regulate bulk flow rates exiting from <b>sieve</b> <b>elements</b> of release phloem. The review identifies strong circumstantial evidence that resource transport through the source-path-sink system is consistent with the high-pressure manifold model of phloem transport. The analysis then moves to exploring mechanisms that may link demand for resources, by cells of meristematic and expansion/storage sinks, with plasmodesmatal conductances of release phloem.

SUT 1 {{serves as a}} high-affinity transporter essential for phloem loading and long-distance transport in solanaceous species. SUT 4 is a low-affinity transporter with an expression pattern overlapping that of SUT 1. Both SUT 1 and SUT 4 localize to enucleate <b>sieve</b> <b>elements</b> of tomato. New sucrose transporter–like proteins, named SUT 2, from tomato and Arabidopsis contain extended cytoplasmic domains, thus structurally resembling the yeast sugar sensors SNF 3 and RGT 2. Features common to these sensors are low codon bias, environment of the start codon, low expression, and lack of detectable transport activity. In contrast to LeSUT 1, which is induced during the sink-to-source transition of leaves, SUT 2 is more highly expressed in sink than in source leaves and is inducible by sucrose. LeSUT 2 protein colocalizes with the low- and high-affinity sucrose transporters in <b>sieve</b> <b>elements</b> of tomato petioles, indicating that multiple SUT mRNAs or proteins travel from companion cells to enucleate <b>sieve</b> <b>elements.</b> The SUT 2 gene maps on chromosome V of potato and is linked to a major quantitative trait locus for tuber starch content and yield.

A genotype of Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) was produced in which the function of the amino acid permease gene AAP 6 (At 5 g 49630) was abolished. Plants homozygous for the insertionally inactivated AAP 6 gene had a significantly larger mean rosette width than the wild type and a greater number of cauline leaves. Seeds from the aap 6 mutant were also significantly larger than those from the wild-type plants. <b>Sieve</b> <b>element</b> (SE) sap was collected by aphid stylectomy and the amino acids derivatized, separated, and quantified using Capillary Electrophoresis with Laser Induced Fluorescence (CE-LIF). In spite of the large variation across samples, the total amino acid concentration of SE sap of the aap 6 mutant plants was significantly lower than that of the wild-type plants. The concentrations of lysine, phenylalanine, leucine, and aspartic acid were all significantly lower in concentration in the aap 6 mutant plants compared with wild-type plants. This is the first direct demonstration of a physiological role for an amino acid transporter in regulating SE composition in vivo.

The {{essentials}} of the intimate interaction between phytoplasmas and their hosts are poorly understood, {{which calls for}} research on potential ultrastructural modifications. We investigated modifications of the sieve-element ultrastructure induced in tomato plants by ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma solani’, the pathogen associated with the stolbur disease. Phytoplasma infection induces a drastic re-organization of sieve-element substructures including changes in plasma membrane surface and distortion of the sieve-element reticulum. Observations of healthy and stolbur-diseased plants provided evidence {{for the emergence of}} structural links between sieve-element plasma membrane and phytoplasmas. One-sided actin aggregates on the phytoplasma surface also inferred a connection between phytoplasma and sieve-element cytoskeleton. Actin filaments displaced from the sieve-element mictoplasm {{to the surface of the}} phytoplasmas in infected <b>sieve</b> <b>elements.</b> Expression analysis revealed a decrease of actin and an increase of ER-resident chaperone luminal binding protein (BiP) in midribs of phytoplasma-infected plants. Collectively, the studies provided novel insights into ultrastructural responses of host <b>sieve</b> <b>elements</b> to phloem-restricted prokaryotes...|$|R
40|$|Phloem {{transport}} of plant viruses {{is an essential}} step in the setting-up of a complete infection of a host plant. After an initial replication step in the first cells, viruses spread from cell-to-cell through mesophyll cells, until they reach the vasculature where they rapidly move to distant sites {{in order to establish}} the infection of the whole plant. This last step is referred to as systemic transport, or long-distance movement, and involves virus crossings through several cellular barriers: bundle sheath, vascular parenchyma and companion cells for virus loading into <b>sieve</b> <b>elements.</b> Viruses are then passively transported within the source-to-sink flow of photoassimilates and are unloaded from <b>sieve</b> <b>elements</b> into sink tissues. However, the molecular mechanisms governing virus long-distance movement are far from being understood. While most viruses seem to move systemically as virus particles, some viruses are transported in <b>sieve</b> <b>elements</b> as viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNP). The nature of the cellular and viral factors constituting these RNPs is still poorly known. The topic of this review will mainly focus on the host and viral factors that facilitate or restrict virus long-distance movement...|$|R
40|$|<b>Sieve</b> <b>elements</b> of legumes contain forisomes-fusiform protein {{bodies that}} are {{responsible}} for sieve-tube occlusion in response to damage or wound signals. Earlier work described the existence of tailless and tailed forisomes. This study intended to quantify and compare location and position of tailless (in Vicia faba) and tailed (in Phaseolus vulgaris) forisomes inside <b>sieve</b> <b>elements</b> and to assess their reactivity and potential mobility in response to a remote stimulus. Location (distribution within <b>sieve</b> <b>elements)</b> and position (forisome tip contacts) of more than altogether 2000 forisomes were screened in 500 intact plants by laser scanning confocal microscopy in the transmission mode. Furthermore, we studied the dispersion of forisomes at different locations in different positions and their positional behaviour in response to distant heat shocks. Forisome distribution turned out to be species-specific, whereas forisome positions at various locations were largely similar in bushbean (Phaseolus) and broadbean (Vicia). In general, the tailless forisomes had higher dispersion rates in response to heat shocks than the tailed forisomes and forisomes at the downstream (basal) end dispersed more frequently than those at the upstream end (apical). In contrast to the tailless forisomes that only oscillate in response to heat shocks, downstream-located tailed forisomes can cover considerable distances within <b>sieve</b> <b>elements.</b> This displacement was prevented by gentle rubbing of the leaf (priming) before the heat shock. Movement of these forisomes was also prohibited by Latrunculin A, an inhibitor of actin polymerization. The apparently active mobility of tailed forisomes gives credence to the idea that at least the latter forisomes are not free-floating, but connected to other sieve-element structures...|$|R
40|$|An ontogenetic {{study of}} the <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> {{protoplast}} of Nicotiana tabacum L. by light and electron microscopy {{has shown that the}} P-protein component (slime) arises as small groups of tubules in the cytoplasm. These subsequently enlarge to form comparatively large compact masses of 231 ± 2. 5 (SE) A (n = 121) tubules, the P-protein bodies. During subsequent differentiation of the <b>sieve</b> <b>element,</b> the P-protein body disaggregates and the tubules become dispersed throughout the cell. This disaggregation occurs at about the same stage of differentiation of the sieve elements as the breakdown of the tonoplast and nucleus. Later, the tubules of P-protein are reorganized into smaller striated 149 ± 4. 5 (SE) A (n = 43) fibrils which are characteristic of the mature sieve elements. The tubular P-protein component has been designated P 1 -protein and the striated fibrillar component P 2 -protein. In fixed material, the sieve-plate pores of mature sieve elements are filled with proteinaceous material which frays out into the cytoplasm as striated fibrils of P 2 -protein. Our observations are compatible with the view that the contents of contiguous mature sieve elements, including the P-protein, are continuous through the sieve-plate pores and that fixing solutions denature the proteins in the pores. They are converted into the electron-opaque material filling the pores...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationships}} between damage-induced electropotential waves (EPWs), sieve tube occlusion, and stop of mass flow were investigated in intact Cucurbita maxima plants. After burning leaf tips, EPWs propagating along the phloem {{of the main}} vein were recorded by extra- and intracellular microelectrodes. The respective EPW profiles (a steep hyperpolarization/depolarization peak followed by a prolonged hyperpolarization/depolarization) probably reflect merged action and variation potentials. A few minutes after passage of the first EPW peak, sieve tubes gradually became occluded by callose, with maximum synthesis occurring ∼ 10 [*]min after burning. Early stop of mass flow, well before completion of callose deposition, pointed to an occlusion mechanism preceding callose deposition. This obstruction of mass flow was inferred from the halt of carboxyfluorescein movement in sieve tubes and intensified secretion of aqueous saliva by feeding aphids. The early occlusion is probably due to proteins, as indicated by a dramatic drop in soluble <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> proteins and a simultaneous coagulation of <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> proteins shortly after the burning stimulus. Mass flow resumed 30 – 40 [*]min after burning, as demonstrated by carboxyfluorescein movement and aphid activities. Stop of mass flow by Ca 2 +-dependent occlusion mechanisms is attributed to Ca 2 + influx during EPW passage; the reversibility of the occlusion is explained by removal of Ca 2 + ions...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of EntomologyJohn C. ReeseThe soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura, is a pest of soybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr. Studies to find control {{methods were}} {{initiated}} in 2000 {{when it was}} first detected in the United States. Aphis glycines can reduce yields by as much as 50 %, and vectors several viral diseases. Plant resistance to A. glycines is one important component of integrated control. In the first study, reproduction of A. glycines was compared on 240 soybean entries. Eleven had fewer nymphs produced compared with two susceptible checks (KS 4202 and Pioneer® 95 B 15). Antibiosis and antixenosis were assessed in no-choice and choice tests, respectively. Nine entries showed moderate antibiosis and the other two (K 1639 and Pioneer® 95 B 97) showed strong antibiosis and antixenosis as categories of resistance to A. glycines. In the second study, chlorophyll loss was estimated in no-choice tests on infested and uninfested leaves of KS 4202. The minimum combined number to detect significant chlorophyll loss was 30 aphids confined for 10 days. Using this number, seven resistant entries found in the first study were evaluated. There was no significant chlorophyll reduction between infested and uninfested leaves of five of the resistant entries (K 1621, K 1639, 95 B 97, Dowling and Jackson). Jackson and Dowling had a significantly lower percentage loss than the susceptible checks. In the third study, assessment of feeding behavior of A. glycines was compared and recorded for 9 h on four resistant entries and KS 4202. The average time needed to reach the first <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> phase by A. glycines was 3. 5 h in KS 4202 while in the resistant entries it was 7. 5 h, and the total duration in this phase was longer than an hour in KS 4202, and only two to seven minutes in the resistant entries. These data suggest that phloem tissues in the resistant plants change feeding behavior. However, aphids first reached the xylem phase and then the <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> phase, and the time that aphids spent ingesting xylem sap was not different among all entries; therefore, it is possible that xylem sap in the resistant entries may contain toxic substances that alter aphid behavior and restrain further activities on the <b>sieve</b> <b>element</b> phase...|$|E

The differences in degree of cryoprotection indicated that <b>sieve</b> <b>elements</b> and companion cells of the source leaf, petiole, and sink leaf contain {{a high concentration of}} solute. The osmotic pressure of various types of cells was measured by observing incipient plasmolysis in freeze-substituted tissues equilibrated with a series of mannitol solutions prior to rapid freezing.

40|$|Remote-controlled Ca 2 + influx, {{elicited}} by electropotential waves, triggers local signaling cascades in <b>sieve</b> <b>elements</b> and companion cells {{along the}} phloem of Vicia faba plants. The stimulus strength {{seems to be}} communicated by the rate and duration of Ca 2 + influx into <b>sieve</b> <b>elements</b> (SEs). The cooperative recruitment of Ca 2 + channels results in a graded response of forisome culminating in full sieve-tube occlusion. Several lines of evidence are integrated into a model that links the mode and strength of the electropotential waves (EPWs) with forisome dispersion, mediated by transiently enhanced levels of local Ca 2 + release dependent on both plasma membrane and ER Ca 2 + channels...|$|R
