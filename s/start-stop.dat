Farrar and Tweedy romanticized tales about unemployment, alcoholism, and the feeling {{of living in a}} small town in an effort to emulate the profundity of songwriters such as Woody Guthrie. Musically, No Depression was influenced by the <b>start-stop</b> musical pattern of the Minutemen. The cover of the album features a blurry photo of the band, taken by J.

25|$|Unfortunately, Leeds {{image was}} {{tarnished}} by {{an incident in}} January 2000 involving Jonathan Woodgate and Lee Bowyer, which left an Asian student in hospital with severe injuries. The trial of Bowyer and Woodgate took nearly two years to resolve before the <b>start-stop</b> court case {{came to a close}} (a prejudicial Sunday Mirror article in 2001 caused the original trial to collapse and a re-trial was scheduled several months later). Bowyer was cleared, and Woodgate convicted of affray and sentenced to community service. Bowyer played some of the finest football of his career during the trial and would often drive straight from court to play for Leeds; however, Woodgate's form deteriorated, and he had to sit out games due to pressure.|$|E
40|$|Friction {{and wear}} tests were {{conducted}} on optimized sputtered Cr 2 O 3 and Cr 2 O 3 with metallic binder coatings. The coatings were applied on the bearing surface of journal foil air bearings and were tested against chrome-carbide-coated journal surfaces. The objective {{of the study was}} to develop a coating system which would withstand 9000 <b>start-stops</b> and high-speed rubs (maximum acceleration, 100 gs) in temperatures ranging from room temperature to 650 C. The Cr 2 O 3 coating completed the test sequence and the coating consisting of Cr 2 O 3 with metallic binders completed 3000 <b>start-stops.</b> The coefficient of friction of the coatings at 650 C was found to be about half that at room temperature. It was concluded, therefore, that the coatings should perform much better in a high temperature environment alone. The decrease in friction at high temperature is attributed to oxidation and interactions of the coatings and substrates at the interface temperature...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of advanced Intelligent Transportation Systems, and particularly those which involve real–time traffic management, requires a network-wide {{assessment of their}} impact {{as opposed to an}} isolated analysis of key intersections. To support such assessments, an integrated simulation environment that allows the use of different modeling levels (e. g., macro-meso-micro) offers undeniable advantages. One of the advantages is that traffic assignment results produced by any type of network loading modeling can be stored and reused for another simulation run. But even in an integrated environment with separate models, deciding between microscopic or mesoscopic was until recently a necessary and difficult choice. On the one hand, microscopic traffic simulation models emulate the dynamics of individual vehicles in a detailed network representation based on car-following, lane changing, and gap acceptance models. They also account explicitly for traffic control. As such, they are very appropriate for operational analysis due to the detail of information provided by the simulator. However, they have a significant calibration and computational cost. On the other hand, mesoscopic models combine simplified flow dynamics with explicit treatment of interrupted flows at intersections and allow modeling of large networks with high computational efficiency. However, the loss of realism implied by a mesoscopic model makes it necessary to emulate detailed outputs; for instance, de-tector measurements or instantaneous emissions. Some outputs, such as the number of <b>start-stops</b> or the exact location of con-gestion within a section elude even the most detailed mesoscopic simulators. This analysis gives rise to the need to combine meso and micro approaches into new concurrent hybrid traffic simulators where very large-scale networks are modeled mesoscopically and areas of complex interactions benefit from the finer detail of microscopic simulation. Combining an event-based mesoscopic model with a more detailed, time-sliced microsimulator raises consistency problems within the network rep-resentation and the meso-micro-meso transitions...|$|R
40|$|Hydropower is a renewable, {{reliable}} and highly efficient source of energy. Hydropower {{has the ability}} to run as a base load and to adjust load rapidly. This makes hydropower suitable for coupling with other renewable energy sources to stabilize frequency fluctuations. This ability has been used increasingly over the last decade due to the deregulation of the electricity markets and the introduction of other renewable energy sources, such as wind power. These changes have involved a substantial increase in the load variations and frequent <b>start-stops.</b> Such operating conditions may lead to unnecessary stresses and losses in turbines. Throughout the world, hydropower is the largest renewable source of energy. Currently, {{there is a need for}} refurbishment of old hydropower plants because most of them have reached the end of their design period. Efficiency may be improved by upgrading these older turbines. During the design or refurbishment phase of turbines, model testing and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) are the main tools available to predict, test and verify the performance as well as to investigate the flow characteristics. The use of CFD in the design and refurbishment process is becoming increasingly popular due to its flexibility, detailed flow description and cost effectiveness compared to model testing, which has been used over the last century of turbines development. However, issues still must be resolved due to the combined flow physics involved in hydropower machines, such as flow turbulence, separation, vortices, unsteadiness, swirl flow, strong adverse pressure gradients, convoluted geometry and numerical artifacts. Therefore, experimental data in such complicated systems are required to validate the numerical simulations and develop more accurate models. This thesis presents an experimental and numerical investigation performed on a reaction type axial water turbine. The investigation was performed on a model known as the Porjus U 9. It is a geometrically similar model of the prototype turbine produced on a 1 : 3. 1 scale. The main objectives were to characterize the flow phenomena in this modern Kaplan turbine model, to build a data bank for the validation of the CFD tools and to study the scale-up between the model and prototype, because the corresponding prototype is available for similar experiments. The investigation was performed at three different operating points: part load, best efficiency point (BEP) and high load. The technique used to investigate the flow was laser Doppler anemometry. The investigation was performed with time- and phase-averaged velocity measurements in several sections of the turbine where different periodic and non-periodic flow phenomena were captured. Some engineering quantities were also calculated to describe the turbine characteristics, such as the pressure recovery factor and the swirl number. At off-design operations, vortex breakdown was present. The numerical analysis of the model is also presented, where several RANS turbulence models were tested. The aim was to evaluate the capability of the turbulence models to predict the flow physics in the water turbines at the BEP. Validation was made with the experimental results in order to extend the range of confidence in the CFD results.

25|$|Holden {{announced}} on December 22, 2008 that its Elizabeth, South Australia production line would be split to commence local {{production of the}} Cruze sedan and the Australian-developed hatchback. Production was originally scheduled to start by September 2010. However, it was confirmed in January 2010 that production would in fact begin in March 2011. The announcement to assemble the car came {{as a response to}} the slowing sales of the larger, locally produced Holden Commodore range. The Australian Government committed 149million to the program from its $6.2billion Green Car Innovation Fund, with a further $30million given by the State Government of South Australia. GM Holden matched both amounts, but the then chairman and managing director Mark Reuss would not reveal Holden's total investment. Reuss announced his firm would be considering the utilization of liquid petroleum gas (LPG), compressed natural gas (CNG), ethanol (E85) flexible-fuel and petrol/electric hybrid <b>start-stop</b> system powertrain technologies. These technologies, if materialized, would supplement the four-cylinder petrol and diesel powertrain offerings already confirmed by Holden at the time of the announcement.|$|E
500|$|As The Primitives, Tweedy and Farrar {{were highly}} {{influenced}} by punk bands such as The Ramones and The Sex Pistols.

Farrar typically wrote songs about Middle America, while Tweedy wrote about more mainstream topics such as relationships. Farrar took influence from authors such as Kurt Vonnegut and Jack Kerouac, whom he read while working at his mother's bookstore.

2500|$|Introduced in 2009 as a 2010 {{model year}} vehicle, the RX 450h (GLV10/GLV15) premiered {{alongside}} its non-hybrid counterpart, the RX 350.

The RX 450h {{was scheduled to}} go on sale in the U.S. in mid to late 2009, with sales introductions for the RX 450h in Asia (including Japan) and Europe in the same year. The RX 450h features an upgraded 3.5L 2GR-FXE V6 engine (shared with the RX 350) which produces [...] at 6000 rpm, along with a new inverter which boosts total horsepower to [...] (with the electric motors providing an added [...] ). The new inverter is 8kg lighter, and more efficient. Up to three electric motors {{are used in the}} hybrid system, including two dual motors for the forward wheels (123kW output), and a third for the rear wheels on the AWD model (50kW; engages when slippage is detected or the throttle pressed firmly). The RX 450h's V6 engine now runs on the Atkinson cycle for added efficiency. Compared to the prior Otto cycle system, the Atkinson cycle has a lower compression ratio, along with higher expansion ratio inside engine cylinders. This system uses less energy to form fuel-air mixtures, and releases more energy. A lighter, more free-flowing oil (0W-20) is also used, reducing friction energy loss and oil pump power requirements. Two additional systems are added to the RX 450h's Lexus Hybrid Drive powertrain, an exhaust heat recovery system to reduce engine warm-up periods (optimizing engine <b>start-stop</b> times, particularly in cold conditions), and a cooled exhaust gas-recirculation system to reduce fuel pumping loss. The electric motors use the first automotive application of liquid cooling {{on both sides of the}} high-current transistors, allowing greater contribution from the electric motors versus the gasoline engine.|$|E
