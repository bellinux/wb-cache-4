5|$|Another {{method of}} {{increasing}} firepower was to vary the projectile fired or {{the nature of}} the propellant. Early ironclads used black powder, which expanded rapidly after combustion; this meant cannons had relatively short barrels, to prevent the barrel itself slowing the shell. The <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> the black powder explosion also meant that guns were subjected to extreme stress. One important step was to press the powder into pellets, allowing a slower, more controlled explosion and a longer barrel. A further step forward was the introduction of chemically different brown powder which combusted more slowly again. It also put less stress on the insides of the barrel, allowing guns to last longer and to be manufactured to tighter tolerances.|$|E
5|$|On March 16, 2009, the new South Ferry station opened, {{replacing}} the original loop station. The loop station could only accommodate {{the first five}} cars of a train and required the use of gap fillers because of the <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> the loop curve. The new station was built as a two-track, full (10-car)-length island platform on a less severe curve, permitting the operation of a typical terminal station. The newer station {{does not have a}} connection to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, and is underneath the loop station. The MTA claimed that the new station saved four to six minutes of a passenger's trip time and increased the peak capacity of the 1 service to 24 trains per hour, as opposed to 16 to 17 trains per hour with the loop station. This was the first new station to open since 1989 when the IND 63rd Street Line stations opened.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart of}} the Fabry–Pérot {{interferometer}} {{is a pair of}} partially silvered glass optical flats spaced several millimeters to centimeters apart with the silvered surfaces facing each other. (Alternatively, a Fabry–Pérot etalon uses a transparent plate with two parallel reflecting surfaces.) As with the Fizeau interferometer, the flats are slightly beveled. In a typical system, illumination is provided by a diffuse source set at the focal plane of a collimating lens. A focusing lens produces what would be an inverted image of the source if the paired flats were not present; i.e. {{in the absence of the}} paired flats, all light emitted from point A passing through the optical system would be focused at point A'. In Fig.6, only one ray emitted from point A on the source is traced. As the ray passes through the paired flats, it is multiply reflected to produce multiple transmitted rays which are collected by the focusing lens and brought to point A' on the screen. The complete interference pattern takes the appearance of a set of concentric rings. The <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> the rings depends on the reflectivity of the flats. If the reflectivity is high, resulting in a high Q factor (i.e. high finesse), monochromatic light produces a set of narrow bright rings against a dark background. In Fig.6, the low-finesse image corresponds to a reflectivity of 0.04 (i.e. unsilvered surfaces) versus a reflectivity of 0.95 for the high-finesse image.|$|E

40|$|The effect <b>of</b> <b>sharpness</b> {{angle on}} tool wear {{and the effect}} of tool wear on {{machined}} surface roughness were investigated in wood flour/polyethylene composite (WFPEC) peripheral up-milling using cemented tungsten carbide (TC) tools. It was shown that nose width and edge recession increased with increasing feeding length. During the milling process, the wear of the nose width was smallest for the tool with a <b>sharpness</b> angle <b>of</b> 45 °, followed by tools with <b>sharpness</b> angles <b>of</b> 55 ° and 65 °. The wear of edge recession was highest for the tool with a <b>sharpness</b> angle <b>of</b> 45 °, followed by tools with <b>sharpness</b> angles <b>of</b> 55 ° and 65 °. The nose width increased with increasing sharpness angle, the edge recession decreased with increasing sharpness angle, and the machined surface roughness increased with increasing sharpness angle after a feeding length of 40 m. The nose width had a positive effect on the machined surface roughness, and the machined surface roughness increased with increasing nose width. The edge recession had little effect on the machined surface roughness. The clearance face roughness of the worn tool increased with increasing sharpness angle. The analysis of the SEM micrographs and EDS of the clearance face of the worn tool showed that the wear mechanisms of the cemented tungsten carbide tool were oxidation and abrasion in the range tested during cutting. Thus, a slight wear of the edge recession is gained in exchange for a lower machined surface roughness by decreasing the sharpness angle. Validerad; 2014; 20140507 (matse...|$|R

25|$|Early Minox cameras from Minox A/III to Minox B were {{equipped}} with a four-element, three-group Complan (lens) designed by ex-Leica lens designer Arthur Seibert. The Complan lens has a curved film plane, hence in these cameras the negative must be held in an arc to improve the edge-to-edge <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> the image. The Minox enlarger also holds the negative in this same curve. Later models, beginning with late model Minox B, to the current model TLX, using the 15mm f/3.5 four-element, three-group flat-field Minox lens, and the negative was held flat. The advance was attributed by Kasiemeir (Small MINOX Big Pictures 1971 edition) to new rare-earth elements.

25|$|The {{resolution}} of pit eyes can be greatly improved by incorporating a material {{with a higher}} refractive index to form a lens, which may greatly reduce the blur radius encountered—hence increasing the resolution obtainable. The most basic form, seen in some gastropods and annelids, consists of a lens of one refractive index. A far sharper image can be obtained using materials with a high refractive index, decreasing to the edges; this decreases the focal length and thus allows a sharp image to form on the retina. This also allows a larger aperture for a given <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> image, allowing more light to enter the lens; and a flatter lens, reducing spherical aberration. Such an inhomogeneous lens is necessary {{in order for the}} focal length to drop from about 4 times the lens radius, to 2.5 radii.|$|E

25|$|Bank Hall, {{built in}} the Jacobean style in 1608, is a brick built mansion of three storeys with Dutch gables and a square central tower on the south front. Some of the {{original}} brickwork in a diaper (lozenge) flushwork pattern is visible on one gable. The house was restored and enlarged by architect George Webster in 1832–3. He added a wing to the west elevations, built a porch on the north side, remodelled the 1608 north elevation windows, covered the roofs with blue Cumbrian slates and finished the walls with stone details. Webster carried out the alterations sympathetically, in a style corresponding to the 17th-century building, but the difference is marked by the colour of the brickwork and <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> the detail. Most windows were renewed during the restoration and two Italian style bay windows added to the south front, altering its appearance.|$|E
25|$|The Mk. II also {{included}} a new transmitter, which had increased in power three times from 50 to 150kW.

25|$|A {{challenge}} for any diving bird {{is the change}} in refraction between air and water. The eyes of many birds have two foveae (the fovea is {{the area of the}} retina the greatest density of light receptors), and a kingfisher is able to switch from the main central fovea to the auxiliary fovea when it enters water; a retinal streak of high receptor density which connects the two foveae allows the image to swing temporally as the bird drops onto the prey. The egg-shaped lens of the eye points towards the auxiliary fovea, enabling the bird to maintain visual acuity underwater. Because of the positions of the foveae, the kingfisher has monocular vision in air, and binocular vision in water. The underwater vision is not as a sharp as in air, but the ability to judge the distance of moving prey {{is more important than the}} <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> the image.|$|E

40|$|Abstract As one of {{the most}} {{fundamental}} operations in computer graphics and computer vision, sharpness enhancement can enhance an image in respect <b>of</b> <b>sharpness</b> characteristics. Unfortunately, the prevalent methods often fail to eliminate image noise, unrealistic details, or incoherent enhancement. In this paper, we propose a new sharpness enhancement approach that can boost the <b>sharpness</b> characteristics <b>of</b> an image effectively with affinity-based edge preserving. Our approach includes three gradient-domain operations: sharpness saliency representation, affinity-based gradient transformation, and gradient-domain image reconstruction. Moreover, we also propose an evaluation method based on sharpness distribution for analyzing all sharpness enhancement approaches in respect <b>of</b> <b>sharpness</b> characteristics. By evaluating the sharpness distribution and comparing the visual appearance, we demonstrate the effectiveness <b>of</b> our <b>sharpness</b> enhancement approach.

25|$|In {{this system}} a {{filament}} {{is located at}} one focus of an ellipsoidal reflector and has a condenser lens {{at the front of}} the lamp. A shade is located at the image plane, between the reflector and lens, and the projection of the top edge of this shade provides the low-beam cutoff. The shape of the shade edge and its exact position in the optical system determine the shape and <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> the cutoff. The shade may be lowered by a solenoid actuated pivot to provide low beam, and removed from the light path for high beam. Such optics are known as BiXenon or BiHalogen projectors. If the cutoff shade is fixed in the light path, separate high-beam lamps are required. The condenser lens may have slight fresnel rings or other surface treatments to reduce cutoff sharpness. Modern condenser lenses incorporate optical features specifically designed to direct some light upward towards the locations of retroreflective overhead road signs.|$|E
25|$|In {{the later}} {{years of his}} life Coningsby {{suffered}} many difficulties. He was a widower, without any male heir, and subject to innumerable lawsuits. For some severe reflections on Lord Harcourt, the Lord Chancellor, in connection with these legal worries, he was, as Swift notes in his diary, committed to the Tower of London on 27 February 1720. Coningsby's troubles in law arose from his purchase of the manors of Leominster and Marden. After elaborate investigations, he convinced himself that the lord's rights had in many instances been trespassed upon by the copyhold tenants. He caused ejectments to be brought against many persons for being in possession of estates as freehold which he claimed to be copyhold, and as these claims were resisted by the persons in possession, his last days were embittered by constant strife. His collections concerning Marden were printed in 1722–7 in a bulky tome, without any title-page, and with pagination of great irregularity, but were never published. When his right to the Marden property was disputed, all the copies of this work but a few were destroyed. Through his <b>sharpness</b> <b>of</b> temper he was exposed to the caustic sallies of Atterbury in the House of Lords, and to the satires of Swift and Pope in their writings.|$|E
