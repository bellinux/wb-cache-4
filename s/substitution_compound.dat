40|$|Abstract Adenosine {{is known}} to exert most of its {{physiological}} functions by acting as local modulator at four receptor subtypes named A 1, A 2 A, A 2 B and A 3 (ARs). Principally {{as a result of}} the difficulty in identifying potent and selective agonists, the A 2 B AR is the least extensively characterised of the adenosine receptors family. Despite these limitations, growing understanding of the physiological meaning of this target indicates promising therapeutic perspectives for specific ligands. As A 2 B AR signalling seems to be associated with pre/postconditioning cardioprotective and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, selective agonists may represent a new therapeutic group for patients suffering from coronary artery disease. Herein we present an overview of the recent advancements in identifying potent and selective A 2 B AR agonists reported in scientific and patent literature. These compounds can be classified into adenosine-like and nonadenosine ligands. Nucleosidebased agonists are the result of modifying adenosine by substitution at the N 6 -, C 2 -positions of the purine heterocycle and/or at the 5 ′-position of the ribose moiety or combinations of these <b>substitutions.</b> <b>Compounds</b> 1 -deoxy...|$|R

Inflammation characterized by edema and accumulation of leucocytes accompanied necrosis. The ability of electrolytes to produce necrosis was found to increase with the valence of their basic ion, and in this respect was in accord with their ability to denature proteins. The quantity of different electrolytes needed to produce necrosis varied {{in the same order}} as the molar concentration of these electrolytes, that is isotonic with liver or kidney cells. Necrosis caused by amino compounds occurred with similar relation to the isotonicity of liver cells. In this as in other relations the cells acted as osmometers. The foregoing relations indicate that denaturation of proteins, necrosis of living tissue, and osmotic activity of liver or kidney cells are determined by molecular weight, valence, and ion-dissociation of electrolytes, that is, by the factors that determine the colligative properties of electrolytes.

A solid solution phase (R- 3 m) is observed in the range of 0 {{less than or equal to}} y less than or equal to 0. 1 for the titanium-doped materials. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows that there are Ni 3 +, Ni 2 +, Co 3 +, Co 2 + and Ti 4 + five transition metal ions in titanium-doped materials. Rietveld refinement of X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns indicates that titanium substitution changes the materials' structure with different cationic distribution. An increase of the Ni/Co amount in the 3 a Li site is found with the addition of titanium amount. An improved cycling performance is observed for titanium-doped cathode materials, which is interpreted to a significant suppression of phase transitions and lattice changes during cycling. The thermal stability of titanium-doped materials is also improved, which can be attributed to its lower oxidation ability and enhanced structural stability at delithiated state.
