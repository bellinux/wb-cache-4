50|$|The Brown Sanctuary is a {{northern}} wetland {{surrounded by a}} small pond and bordered by a black spruce, tamarack, and white cedar swamp. Several shrubs {{can be found in}} the sanctuary, including leather leaf, bog-rosemary, Labrador tea, and both <b>small</b> and large <b>cranberry.</b> Several species of orchids are also found here.|$|R
50|$|Sphagnum mosses are the {{dominant}} low lying form of vegetation in the bog. About 12 species of heaths (members {{of the family}} Ericaceae) thrive in the bog. The most common are Labrador tea (Rhododendron groenlandicum), leatherleaf (Chamaedaphne spp.), <b>small</b> <b>cranberry</b> (Vaccinium oxycoccos), bog-laurel (Kalmia polifolia), and sheep-laurel (Kalmia angustifolia). At least nine species of orchids (family Orchidaceae) are found in Mer Bleue along {{with a variety of}} cottongrasses (Eriophorum spp.) and sedges (Carex spp.) in the family Cyperaceae.|$|E
50|$|Tamarack stands cast light {{shade and}} so {{usually have a}} dense {{undergrowth}} of shrubs and herbs. Because the tree has an extensive range, {{a great variety of}} shrubs is associated with it. Dominant tall shrubs include dwarf and swamp birch (Betula glandulosa and Betula pumila), willows (Salix spp.), speckled alder (Alnus rugosa), and red-osier dogwood (Cornus stolonifera). Low shrubs include bog Labrador tea (Ledum groenlandicum), bog-rosemary (Andromeda glaucophylla), leather leaf (Chamaedaphne calyculata), and <b>small</b> <b>cranberry</b> (Vaccinium oxycoccos). Characteristically the herbaceous cover includes sedges (Carex spp.), cottongrass (Eriophorum spp.), three-leaved false Solomonseal (Maianthemum trifolium), marsh cinquefoil (Potentilla palustris), marsh-marigold (Caltha palustris), and bogbean (Menyanthes trifoliata). Ground cover is usually composed of sphagnum moss (Sphagnum spp.) and other mosses.|$|E
50|$|Wetlands, {{including}} a fen, in the Salt Creek headwaters {{should also be}} investigated further since the uncommon bog species tamarack (Larix laricina) has been observed there. The state threatened <b>small</b> <b>cranberry</b> (Vaccinium oxycoccos) has been found at another wetland in the Salt Creek headwaters. Although {{they are no longer}} on the Indiana list of endangered species, both the American badger (Taxidea taxus) and bobcat (Lynx rufus) have been found within the Salt Creek watershed in recent years. These two species were on Indiana’s original endangered species list established in 1969, but have since improved their populations statewide and were removed from the list in July 2005. They are now protected as nongame species that cannot be hunted or trapped intentionally.|$|E

50|$|The {{contrast}} is also great between North Fork Mountain's quartzite-outcrop vegetation and the superficially similar vegetation {{of the rocky}} sandstone-conglomerate openings of Spruce Knob, Dolly Sods, and similar sites just west of North Fork Mountain. While North Fork Mountain's lesser rainfall is a substantial factor in this difference, another consideration {{is the nature of}} the bedrock itself. North Fork Mountain's fine-grained Tuscarora quartzite erodes into sand, which either quickly disperses or persists in cracks and crevices, sometimes even forming tiny dunelets on wide, nearly flat open outcrops, as on Panther Knob. On the other hand, the various mountains along the Allegheny Front immediately west of North Fork Mountain are capped instead by the coarse Pottsville sandstone conglomerate, which erodes instead primarily into gravel rather than sand. While many widespread Appalachian rock-outcrop species are shared between the two areas, openings on Dolly Sods lack the silvery nailwort, the white alumroot, and table-mountain pine, and instead support a greater species diversity, even including such wetland plants as the <b>small</b> <b>cranberry</b> (Vaccinium oxycoccos).|$|E
50|$|Chippewa Moraine Lakes is a Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources-designated State Natural Area that {{comprises}} nine separate sites, {{spread out}} over roughly 30 square miles (78 km2). Each site features a primarily undisturbed lake located within the rough terminal moraine topography of northern Chippewa County. Each lake has its own unique species assemblage due to physical and chemical characteristics of the lake. The nine lakes are: Camp Lake, a 6-acre (2.4 ha) lake ringed by a floating sphagnum bog mat containing such plant species as white beak rush, narrow-leaved sundew, <b>small</b> <b>cranberry,</b> and grass pink orchid. Spence Lake, a 12-acre (4.9 ha), acidic bog lake that is the headwaters of Foster Creek. Conifer swamp surrounds {{the northern part of}} the lake, hardwood swamp surrounds the central part, while the southern part is largely a sedge meadow, impacted by beaver activity. Bass Lake #1, a 6-acre (2.4 ha) soft-water seepage lake, with at least one rare plant species present. Bass Lake #5, an 8-acre (3.2 ha), deep, hard-water seepage lake that is the main headwaters branch of Mud Creek. Deer Lake, a 6-acre (2.4 ha) seepage lake that is also part of the headwaters of Mud Creek. Burnt Wagon Lake, a 15-acre (6.1 ha) softwater seepage lake that is landlocked, with no development. Fishpole Lake, an 11-acre (4.5 ha) meromictic lake. Due to its size, shape, and depth, the lake's water column is permanently thermally stratified, unlike most Wisconsin lakes, leading to unique chemical and biological characteristics. Plummer Lake, a 41-acre (16.6 ha), deep, hard-water seepage lake. Little Plummer Lake, a 10-acre (4 ha) wild (no access roads or development) hardwater seepage lake that drains into Plummer Lake.|$|E

50|$|Mississippi Lake is a lake in Lanark County in Ontario, Canada. Ontario's Mississippi River flows {{northeast}} and north through the lake. Several <b>small</b> creeks including <b>Cranberry</b> Creek, McCrearys Creek, and McGibbon Creek drain {{into the lake}} from adjoining forest and agricultural land. The lake is distinctive for having one side (to the north) {{that is part of}} the Canadian shield, while the other is mostly limestone. The lake is a remnant of the old Champlain Sea, which flooded eastern Ontario at the end of last ice age. The former shoreline of the sea can still be traced inland from the north shore of the lake.|$|R
50|$|Originally, Shenandoah Acres was a farm {{consisting}} of orchards, and a cranberry bog encircling a <b>small</b> pond. The <b>cranberry</b> bog {{was well known}} by botanists {{as a location for}} several rare plants and orchids including the rose pogonia and grass pink orchids. In the journal Claytonia, the botanist Lloyd Carr described the pond as a sea of pink when the orchids were in bloom. The cranberry bog was {{one of a series of}} sinkhole ponds and wetlands in the Maple Flats area; perhaps the only one remaining with a similar flora is Spring Pond. After the bog was destroyed to create Shenandoah Acres, many of the rare species once found there became locally extinct.|$|R
40|$|Farmers rely almost {{exclusively}} on the imported European honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) for fruit and vegetable crop pollination services. The recent decline in honeybee health has underscored he danger of relying on a single species to provide vital services. Increasing pollinator biodiversity with native bees may provide biological insurance against the decline of any particular species. By examining cropping systems, {{it is possible to}} determine which native bees are providing pollination services and then augment habitat to increase their numbers or attempt domestication. In this study, we examined the native bee populations in the cranberry growing area of southern coastal Oregon in order to determine if native bees {{play a significant role in}} cranberry pollination. This two-year study surveyed four farms across a 22 km north-south gradient. At least 27 bee species were observed during cranberry bloom (mid-May to late June), of which five were observed foraging on the cranberry flowers. The imported European honeybees and bumble bees foraged at comparable wind speeds, Bombus spp. Foraged at significantly lower average temperatures (P< 0. 0001). Both honeybees and bumble bees collected cranberry pollen while foraging, but 37. 2 % of honeybees were observed nectar-robbing (collecting nectar but no pollen) versus only 11. 3 % of bumble bees. Bumble bees in general, and the western yellow-faced bumble bee (Bombus vosnesenskii Randoszkowski) in particular, are abundant native pollinators of cranberry, and may provide adequate pollination for <b>small</b> Oregon <b>cranberry</b> farms. Conservation of bumble bee habitat and development of managed colonies will help maintain pollination services...|$|R
40|$|The Indian Head River {{is part of}} {{the large}} and complex system of streams and rivers, which {{contribute}} to the South Coastal Plain Watershed. A portion of the river forms the border to the Town of Hanson from where it flows into the main stem of the North River. Further upstream, the river is called the Drinkwater which itself drains into Factory Pond directly upstream of our study site A. Historically the Indian Head, its headwaters and tributaries provided an important fishery for alewives, shad and rainbow smelt. However, the river suffered much the same as other river systems in Massachusetts and fish runs were diverted and dammed for agricultural and industrial purposes. Today, fish that are caught in the river are most likely contaminated with mercury and other metals, which are present in the sediment of Factory Pond, the site of a Fireworks factory. This marks our third year of monitoring water quality indicators at two sites along the river. A third site on the Indian Head Brook was identified and was added this year. Data were collected on discharge, phosphorus and nitrogen concentrations. The Indian Head Brook drains from two ponds in Hanson and passes hydrologically through several <b>small</b> <b>cranberry</b> bogs. Our major concern remains the extremely high concentrations of nitrogen measured at both the upstream and downstream sites along the river. Nitrogen concentrations peaked this year in February at 120 kg per liter. Originally, it was postulated that such high nitrogen concentrations pointed to septic infiltration. However, consistently low coliform counts (10, 20 and 40 colonies per 100 ml) do not appear to confirm this hypothesis. Phosphorus levels often fell within the undetectable limit during the three year study. This year we were able to profile phosphorus levels at all three sites and showed that these drop dramatically during the month of March. We were also able to profile a similar drop – off of nitrogen concentrations at Site C while phosphorus concentrations here remained fairly constant. Macroinvertebrate analyses at the two river sites indicate a relationship between total discharge, biotic indices and species diversity. During periods of lower flow and/or changers in substrate, populations of caddisfly larvae (Trichoptera) either drop out completely or become quite low. Due to their feeding strategies, these insect larvae may migrate to other areas. When discharge is low, other larvae, such as riffle beetles replace caddisfly larvae as the dominant species. Biotic indices also appear to fall when total discharge increases. Recommendations Continue monitoring for Phosphorus and Nitrogen levels in the 2004 / 2005 school year at all three study sites. Collect standing water data from Factory Pond in order to explore nitrogen concentrations here. Design an experiment, which illustrates {{the rise and fall of}} nitrogen concentrations with decay of leaf litter...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cranberries {{have been}} used widely for several decades for the {{prevention}} and treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs). This is the third update of our review first published in 1998 and updated in 2004 and 2008. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of cranberry products in preventing UTIs in susceptible populations. METHODS: Search methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL in The Cochrane Library) and the Internet. We contacted companies involved with the promotion and distribution of cranberry preparations and checked reference lists of review articles and relevant studies. Date of search: July 2012. Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of cranberry products {{for the prevention of}} UTIs. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently assessed and extracted data. Information was collected on methods, participants, interventions and outcomes (incidence of symptomatic UTIs, positive culture results, side effects, adherence to therapy). Risk ratios (RR) were calculated where appropriate, otherwise a narrative synthesis was undertaken. Quality was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. MAIN RESULTS: This updated review includes a total of 24 studies (six cross-over studies, 11 parallel group studies with two arms; five with three arms, and two studies with a factorial design) with a total of 4473 participants. Ten studies were included in the 2008 update, and 14 studies have been added to this update. Thirteen studies (2380 participants) evaluated only cranberry juice/concentrate; nine studies (1032 participants) evaluated only cranberry tablets/capsules; one study compared cranberry juice and tablets; and one study compared cranberry capsules and tablets. The comparison/control arms were placebo, no treatment, water, methenamine hippurate, antibiotics, or lactobacillus. Eleven studies {{were not included in the}} meta-analyses because either the design was a cross-over study and data were not reported separately for the first phase, or there was a lack of relevant data. Data included in the meta-analyses showed that, compared with placebo, water or not treatment, cranberry products did not significantly reduce the occurrence of symptomatic UTI overall (RR 0. 86, 95 % CI 0. 71 to 1. 04) or for any the subgroups: women with recurrent UTIs (RR 0. 74, 95 % CI 0. 42 to 1. 31); older people (RR 0. 75, 95 % CI 0. 39 to 1. 44); pregnant women (RR 1. 04, 95 % CI 0. 97 to 1. 17); children with recurrent UTI (RR 0. 48, 95 % CI 0. 19 to 1. 22); cancer patients (RR 1. 15 95 % CI 0. 75 to 1. 77); or people with neuropathic bladder or spinal injury (RR 0. 95, 95 % CI: 0. 75 to 1. 20). Overall heterogeneity was moderate (I&# 178; = 55 %). The effectiveness of cranberry was not significantly different to antibiotics for women (RR 1. 31, 95 % CI 0. 85, 2. 02) and children (RR 0. 69 95 % CI 0. 32 to 1. 51). There was no significant difference between gastrointestinal adverse effects from cranberry product compared to those of placebo/no treatment (RR 0. 83, 95 % CI 0. 31 to 2. 27). Many studies reported low compliance and high withdrawal/dropout problems which they attributed to palatability/acceptability of the products, primarily the cranberry juice. Most studies of other cranberry products (tablets and capsules) did not report how much of the 'active' ingredient the product contained, and therefore the products may not have had enough potency to be effective. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Prior to the current update it appeared there was some evidence that cranberry juice may decrease the number of symptomatic UTIs over a 12 month period, particularly for women with recurrent UTIs. The addition of 14 further studies suggests that cranberry juice is less effective than previously indicated. Although some of small studies demonstrated a small benefit for women with recurrent UTIs, there were no statistically significant differences when the results of a much larger study were included. Cranberry products were not significantly different to antibiotics for preventing UTIs in three small studies. Given the large number of dropouts/withdrawals from studies (mainly attributed to the acceptability of consuming cranberry products particularly juice, over long periods), and the evidence that the benefit for preventing UTI is <b>small,</b> <b>cranberry</b> juice cannot currently be recommended for the prevention of UTIs. Other preparations (such as powders) need to be quantified using standardised methods to ensure the potency, and contain enough of the 'active' ingredient, before being evaluated in clinical studies or recommended for use...|$|E
60|$|In October I went a-graping to {{the river}} meadows, and loaded myself with {{clusters}} more precious for their beauty and fragrance than for food. There, too, I admired, though I did not gather, the <b>cranberries,</b> <b>small</b> waxen gems, pendants of the meadow grass, pearly and red, which the farmer plucks with an ugly rake, leaving the smooth meadow in a snarl, heedlessly measuring them by the bushel and the dollar only, and sells the spoils of the meads to Boston and New York; destined to be jammed, to satisfy the tastes of lovers of Nature there. So butchers rake the tongues of bison out of the prairie grass, regardless of the torn and drooping plant. The barberry's brilliant fruit was likewise food for my eyes merely; but I collected a small store of wild apples for coddling, which the proprietor and travellers had overlooked. When chestnuts were ripe I laid up half a bushel for winter. It was very exciting at that season to roam the then boundless chestnut woods of Lincoln--they now sleep their long sleep under the railroad--with a bag on my shoulder, and a stick to open burs with in my hand, for I did not always wait for the frost, amid the rustling of leaves and the loud reproofs of the red squirrels and the jays, whose half-consumed nuts I sometimes stole, for the burs which they had selected were sure to contain sound ones. Occasionally I climbed and shook the trees. They grew also behind my house, and one large tree, which almost overshadowed it, was, when in flower, a bouquet which scented the whole neighborhood, but the squirrels and the jays got most of its fruit; the last coming in flocks {{early in the morning}} and picking the nuts out of the burs before they fell, I relinquished these trees to them and visited the more distant woods composed wholly of chestnut. These nuts, as far as they went, were a good substitute for bread. Many other substitutes might, perhaps, be found. Digging one day for fishworms, I discovered the ground-nut (Apios tuberosa) on its string, the potato of the aborigines, a sort of fabulous fruit, which I had begun to doubt if I had ever dug and eaten in childhood, as I had told, and had not dreamed it. I had often since seen its crumpled red velvety blossom supported by the stems of other plants without knowing it to be the same. Cultivation has well-nigh exterminated it. It has a sweetish taste, much like that of a frost-bitten potato, and I found it better boiled than roasted. This tuber seemed like a faint promise of Nature to rear her own children and feed them simply here at some future period. In these days of fatted cattle and waving grain-fields this humble root, which was once the totem of an Indian tribe, is quite forgotten, or known only by its flowering vine; but let wild Nature reign here once more, and the tender and luxurious English grains will probably disappear before a myriad of foes, and without the care of man the crow may carry back even the last seed of corn to the great cornfield of the Indian's God in the southwest, whence he is said to have brought it; but the now almost exterminated ground-nut will perhaps revive and flourish in spite of frosts and wildness, prove itself indigenous, and resume its ancient importance and dignity as the diet of the hunter tribe. Some Indian Ceres or Minerva must have been the inventor and bestower of it; and when the reign of poetry commences here, its leaves and string of nuts may be represented on our works of art.|$|R
