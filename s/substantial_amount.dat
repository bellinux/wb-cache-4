5|$|A {{draft design}} was {{completed}} without foreign assistance by the Construction Department on 11 July 1939, {{but it did}} not reflect the numerous technical developments that had entered capital ship designs after the First World War. In particular, its armor scheme was utterly obsolete, as it lacked any <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> of deck armor or good underwater protection; it came closer to the designs of 20 to 25years previous than to that of a modern warship.|$|E
5|$|A <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> of {{rebuilding}} followed. In 1733, work {{began on the}} royal residence of Christiansborg Palace which was completed in 1745. In 1749, development of the prestigious district of Frederiksstaden was initiated. Designed by Nicolai Eigtved in the Rococo style, its centre contained the mansions which now form Amalienborg Palace. Major extensions to the naval base of Holmen were undertaken while the city's cultural importance was enhanced with the Royal Theatre and the Royal Academy of Fine Arts.|$|E

5|$|As well {{as these}} molecules, {{emission}} from heavy atoms such as iron, magnesium and silicon was detected, with abundances {{consistent with what}} would {{be found in a}} cometary nucleus. Although a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> of water was detected spectroscopically, it was not as much as predicted beforehand, meaning that either the water layer thought to exist below the clouds was thinner than predicted, or that the cometary fragments did not penetrate deeply enough.|$|E
5|$|Both {{candidates}} received {{financial support}} from outside the district, some of which was used to buy votes or bribe voters to stay home. Breckinridge received several thousand dollars, with a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> coming from Washington, D.C. banker William Wilson Corcoran; estimates of Letcher's support ranged from $30,000 to $100,000. Breckinridge won the canvass by 526 votes and received 71% {{of the vote in}} Owen County, which recorded 123 more votes than registered voters.|$|E
5|$|Concentrations {{of heavy}} metals below the crust are {{generally}} higher, with most being {{found in the}} largely iron-silicon-nickel core. Platinum, for example, comprises approximately 1 part per billion of the crust whereas its concentration in the core {{is thought to be}} nearly 6,000 times higher. Recent speculation suggests that uranium (and thorium) in the core may generate a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> of the heat that drives plate tectonics and (ultimately) sustains the Earth's magnetic field.|$|E

JB Kobask also had a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> of Crabbet breeding in his pedigree.|$|E
5|$|On February 27, 1853, the twice-widower Crittenden {{married his}} third wife, Elizabeth Moss. Moss was twice-widowed, most {{recently}} to General William Henry Ashley. Moss was Crittenden's wife until his death. Crittenden served {{as attorney general}} until the expiration of Fillmore's term in 1853. Following his service as attorney general, he returned to private life. He made a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> of money establishing mining claims for his clients in the former Mexican territory.|$|E

5|$|The shootdown {{happened}} {{at a very}} tense time in U.S.â€“Soviet relations during the Cold War. The U.S. adopted a strategy of releasing a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> of hitherto highly classified intelligence information in order to exploit a major propaganda advantage over the Soviet Union. Six hours after the plane was downed, the South Korean government issued an announcement that the plane had merely been forced to land abruptly by the Soviets, and that all passengers and crew were safe.|$|E
5|$|Atangana {{won over}} other chiefs and headmen through gifts, tax cuts, flattery, and {{intervention}} on their behalf. He lavished attention on visitors {{from out of}} town, letting them stay at his palace and use his horses, and treating them to feasts. In addition to flattering them, this allowed him to monitor their activities and dealings with the colonial authorities. His clerk appointees in Jaunde informed him of the doings of both the Germans and his subjects. Atangana gained a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> of wealth. He owned workshops and sold produce from five plantations to provision impressed railway construction workers.|$|E

After his return to San Felipe, the citizens began to suspect Desha of murdering Early. A few days after Desha's arrival, Early's clothing was found in a nearby creek. Scattered nearby, a search party located skeletal remains believed to be Early's.|$|E

5|$|Despite the expedition's failure, Carrouges had {{distinguished}} {{himself in}} the campaign. Although he had lost five of his nine men-at-arms and a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> of money he had also been awarded a knighthood on the battlefield, substantially raising his social status {{and the amount of}} money he received from military service. Despite being in poor health on his return from Scotland, Carrouges had business in Paris and in January 1386 he traveled there to collect his wages for the previous year's campaign, leaving his wife with her mother-in-law at the village of Capomesnil.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, the {{telescope}} observed the coordinates {{of the recently}} discovered pulsar, confirming its existence and investigating the dispersion measure. It was also {{used to make the}} first detection of polarization of the pulsar's radiation. This marked the start of a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> of work investigating pulsars at Jodrell, which is still ongoing. In the 30 years following the discovery of pulsars, {{the telescope}} discovered over 100 new pulsars (and astronomers at Jodrell Bank discovered around 2/3 of the total number using the Lovell and other telescopes). 300 pulsars are regularly observed using either the Lovell, or a nearby 42-foot (13-m) dish.|$|E
5|$|Promotions in rank were {{decided by}} the emperor and could occur on special occasions, such as {{installation}} of a new emperor, inauguration of a new reign title, the wedding of a new empress, or {{the selection of a}} royal heir apparent.

Harvard is the nation's oldest institute of higher education and is centered across the Charles River in Cambridge, though the majority of its land holdings and a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> of its educational activities are in Boston. Its business, medical, dental, and public health schools are located in Boston's Allston and Longwood neighborhoods, and Harvard has plans for additional expansion into Allston.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being well}} {{received}} by fans and critically acclaimed and nominated in 1983 for a BAFTA and Golden Globe as best original score, {{and the promise}} of a soundtrack album from Polydor Records in the end titles of the film, the release of the official soundtrack recording was delayed for over a decade. There are two official releases of the music from Blade Runner. In light of the lack of a release of an album, the New American Orchestra recorded an orchestral adaptation in 1982 which bore little resemblance to the original. Some of the film tracks would, in 1989, surface on the compilation Vangelis: Themes, but not until the 1992 release of the Director's Cut version would a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> of the film's score see commercial release.|$|E
5|$|EdwardIII was {{not content}} with the peace {{agreement}} made in his name, but the renewal of the war with Scotland originated in private, rather than royal initiative. A group of English magnates known as The Disinherited, who had lost land in Scotland by the peace accord, staged an invasion of Scotland and won a great victory at the Battle of Dupplin Moor in 1332. They attempted to install Edward Balliol as king of Scotland in DavidII's place, but Balliol was soon expelled {{and was forced to}} seek the help of EdwardIII. The English king responded by laying siege to the important border town of Berwick and defeated a large relieving army at the Battle of Halidon Hill. Edward reinstated Balliol on the throne and received a <b>substantial</b> <b>amount</b> of land in southern Scotland. These victories proved hard to sustain, as forces loyal to DavidII gradually regained control of the country. In 1338, Edward was forced to agree to a truce with the Scots.|$|E
