25|$|Singer-songwriter Björk {{received}} international acclaim for her {{starring role}} in the Danish musical drama Dancer in the Dark directed by Lars von Trier, in which she plays Selma Ježková, a factory worker who struggles {{to pay for her}} son's eye operation. The film premiered at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival, where she won the Best Actress Award. The movie also led Björk to nominations for Best Original Song at the 73rd Academy Awards, with the song I've <b>Seen</b> <b>It</b> <b>All</b> and for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture - Drama.|$|E

She {{was the first of the}} American First Ladies to publicly support the Equal Rights Amendment, though her views on abortion were mixed. Following the Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, Pat stated she was pro-choice. However, in 1972, she said, [...] "I'm really not for abortion. I think it's a personal thing. I mean abortion on demand—wholesale." ...|$|E
500|$|Darren Aronofsky and {{his friend}} Ari Handel created the story for The Fountain, and Aronofsky wrote the screenplay. When Aronofsky saw The Matrix in 1999, he {{considered}} it a film that redefined the science fiction genre. He sought to make a science fiction film that would explore new territory in the genre like The Matrix and its predecessors Star Wars and [...] Aronofsky had in mind a science fiction film that would go beyond the other films whose plots were driven by technology and science. The director said, [...] "We've <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>all.</b> It's not really interesting to audiences anymore. The interesting things are the ideas; the search for God, the search for meaning." ...|$|E

500|$|Examining {{the acting}} in a review {{published}} in Starlog magazine, Alan Jones expressed a preference for the British members of the cast, crediting Geeson as [...] "absolutely first-rate" [...] and criticising [...] "the weak performances from the token Americans, Robin Clarke and Jennifer Ashley". Praising the production values for cost-effectiveness, he discerned signs of Warren's [...] "particular trademark" [...] in such murder scenes as that of Barbra (through repeated scissor-stabbing) and Holly (through heat-searing). He professed his opinion that Inseminoid [...] "is not faultless by any means", citing a predictable and often [...] "ridiculous" [...] plot as factors detracting from his pleasure in viewing the film. Nevertheless, he asserted that Inseminoid meets audience demands for a B film of its genre, progressing [...] "at such a pace that you nearly almost forget that you've <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> before", and declared it to be [...] "far less routine and far more enjoyable than I had expected." ...|$|E
500|$|TV Scoop praised Woodburne's {{performance}} during the MS storyline. They said, [...] "Susan's real life alter ego, Jackie Woodburne {{got to show}} off her excellent acting. As Susan's vision went, and later as she was put into the MRI scanner, Woodburne portrayed real fear and panic". TV Week named Susan as their third [...] "Top Aussie TV Mum". They said [...] "strong-spirited Susan has always doted on her kids, even while putting up with cheating hubby Karl (Alan Fletcher). The modern mum has <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> and still comes up smiling. In 2010, Susan was voted the third [...] "Most Popular TV Mum" [...] in a survey carried out by Yahoo!. Susan was placed seventh in a similar survey carried out by Vouchercodes.co.uk, to find [...] "Britain's favourite television mother". They said [...] "viewers identified with love for her family". In April 2010, Sky included Susan in their feature on the twenty-five most memorable Neighbours characters. They stated, [...] "Kindly but strong matriarch Susan {{may not be the}} most medically robust woman (amnesia, multiple sclerosis, frequent questionable haircuts), but she gets by thanks to her family. She's so devoted, in fact, that after Malcolm, Billy and Libby (sort of) flew the nest, she went and inherited Zeke and Rachel from second husband Alex. Despite her big heart, she can be counted on to get fierce with anyone who tries to upset the Ramsay Street balance – her frequent fights with Izzy in the middle of the street over Karl cemented her reputation as everyone's favourite soap mum." ...|$|E
500|$|Computer Gaming World writer Arinn Dembo {{called the}} storyline {{of a couple}} buying a haunted mansion [...] "a cliché so {{familiar}} that it needs no explanation", but said it still worked in a computer game because the player could directly experience it in that medium, rather than simply watching it in a film. Dembo also praised the game for featuring a female protagonist, though she said Adrienne {{was too much of}} an exaggeratedly feminine [...] "girlie-type girl". Overall, Dembo said the game [...] "achieved a new height of realism and beauty in a computer game" [...] and was [...] "an important technological leap, and represents a step forward for the whole industry". Another Computer Gaming World review said Phantasamagoria [...] "appears to deliver on its ambitious promises" [...] and that although the puzzles are too simple for experienced gamers, the appeal of the game is exploring a setting that [...] "would have had even the folks in Amityville making tracks". Harley Jebens of the Austin American-Statesman said some of the acting was [...] "hilariously bad" [...] and the storyline was predictable, but that the game keeps you engaged, the story draws you in and the controls were well executed. Fort Worth Star-Telegram writer Andy Greiser said the game was a beautiful combination of live actors and computer-built backgrounds, but said the action doesn't start to pick up until the halfway point. In a mixed review, Phil LaRose of The Advocate praised the game for having a female protagonist and excellent special effects, and said it had gone further toward merging the realms of film and game than any other computer game. He also said the game was too linear, with overly simple puzzles and a plotline with [...] "so many recycled concepts in this game, players will feel like they've <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> before".|$|E

2500|$|She celebrated her {{retirement}} by issuing a vocal album entitled Modae no Heya. On this disc's recent re-release in CD format, a reviewer commented of Tani's vocals, [...] "There’s a worldliness {{in her voice}} and a maturity which suggests she’s <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>all...</b> There is however a fragility to her voice, a cracking sense of the truly erotic, the unseen, the taboo which drapes each syllable... hearing music which would usually be readily associated with a mid-70s Samurai movie bedding down with such muted eroticism {{is more than a}} winning formula." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{some critics}} disliked the film. Michael Carter of The Breeze {{summed up the}} film as [...] "all right", though denouncing its {{reliance}} on [...] "cheap jump scares and an even cheaper 'found footage' style". David Stratton of the Australian television series At the Movies said that [...] "it was extremely unthrilling, very obvious, very clichéd. We've <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> before." [...] Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle called it [...] "an excruciatingly tedious YouTube gag cleverly marketed to go viral". Bill Gibron of PopMatters listed the film as the second worst horror film of all time, writing that it lacked [...] "anything remotely redeeming for the seasoned fright fan", and was [...] "a waste of time in both concept and execution".|$|E

2500|$|Tall (6ft 2½ in; 189cm), lanky and handsome, Scott {{displayed}} an easygoing {{charm and}} courtly Southern drawl {{in his early}} films that helped offset his limitations as an actor, where he was frequently found to be stiff or [...] "lumbering". As he matured, however, Scott's acting improved while his features became burnished and leathery, turning him into the ideal [...] "strong, silent" [...] type of stoic hero. The BFI Companion to the Western noted:In his earlier Westerns... the Scott persona is debonair, easy-going, graceful, though with the necessary hint of steel. As he matures into his fifties his roles change. Increasingly Scott becomes {{the man who has}} <b>seen</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> who has suffered pain, loss, and hardship, and who has now achieved (but at what cost?) a stoic calm proof against vicissitude.|$|E
