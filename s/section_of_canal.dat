5|$|An Act of Parliament dated 10 June 1825 {{created the}} New Harbour Company, with powers {{to build the}} harbour at Tywyn Bach, on the sands near Pembrey. The Act {{included}} powers to build a short <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>canal</b> to link with {{the line of the}} Kidwelly and Llanelli Canal. The new harbour was completed in 1832. The community of Burry Port did not exist in 1825, and it was not until 1835 that the name of the company was changed to the Burry Port Company by another Act of Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In 1804, the Ellesmere company {{offered to}} buy out the Chester Canal for 1,000 of their shares, and to take over debts up to £4,000. The Chester Canal held out for more, and the {{negotiations}} failed. Three years later, the financial position of the Chester Canal was better, and they began paying off their debts. Finally in 1813, they agreed to amalgamate, and the action was authorised by a further Act of Parliament. The Ellesmere company paid just half of their 1804 offer, and the 500 Ellesmere shares were distributed between the various Chester shareholders. The Ellesmere and Chester Canal Company took over on 1 July 1813. A new <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>canal</b> and an iron lock were built at Beeston in 1827, to resolve continual problems with leakage there.|$|E
25|$|In February 2012 {{plans for}} the {{regeneration}} of the Selly Oak area were submitted to Birmingham City Council which included a navigable <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>canal</b> from a new junction with the Worcester and Birmingham Canal to the recently reconstructed Harborne Lane bridge along {{the route of the}} former Dudley Canal.|$|E

2500|$|The {{following}} {{list includes}} some {{systems that are}} navigable rivers with <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> <b>canal</b> (e.g. Aire and Calder Navigation) as well as [...] "completely" [...] artificial canals (e.g. Rochdale Canal).|$|R
25|$|The open <b>sections</b> <b>of</b> <b>canal</b> {{are popular}} with walkers, cyclists, fishermen, and narrowboat users. Many of the canalside towpaths have been {{upgraded}} for cycling, and some <b>sections</b> are part <b>of</b> the National Cycle Network.|$|R
25|$|The land surface {{where the}} Churchbridge locks were located was {{stripped}} away by {{open cast mining}} in the 1950s, and {{the route of the}} canal has been completely obliterated. Staffordshire County Council owns some land between the A5 road and the M6 Toll motorway, which has been identified as a suitable route for a new <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>canal.</b>|$|E
25|$|Under {{the terms}} of an Act of Abandonment {{obtained}} in 1954, most of {{the branches of the}} original Wyrley and Essington Canal were closed, including the branch from Ogley to Huddlesford, which was abandoned in 1955. The closing of this <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>canal</b> reduced the demand for water from Chasewater. In 1956 the reservoir is purchased by Brownhills Urban District Council from the British Transport Commission for £5,600 and the reservoir is renamed Chasewater.|$|E
25|$|The {{murder of}} Leanne Tiernan was a {{high-profile}} English child abduction and murder involving a schoolgirl who was abducted {{less than one}} mile from her home on 26 November 2000 while returning from a Christmas shopping trip in Leeds, West Yorkshire, and subsequently murdered. The missing persons inquiry which followed {{was one of the}} largest in the history of West Yorkshire Police, involving the search of around 1,750 buildings, underwater searches of thirty-two drainage wells, the draining of a two-mile <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>canal</b> and the halting of household waste collections.|$|E

25|$|On 6 October 1973, Egypt {{commenced}} Operation Badr {{to retake}} the Sinai, while Syria launched a simultaneous operation to retake the Golan Heights, thereby beginning the Yom Kippur War (known in Egypt as the October War). Egyptian engineering forces built pontoon bridges {{to cross the}} Suez Canal, and stormed the Bar-Lev Line, Israel's defensive line along the canal. Though the Egyptians maintained control {{of most of the}} east bank of the Canal, in the later stages of the war, the Israeli military crossed the southern <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>Canal,</b> cutting off the Egyptian 3rd Army, and occupied a section of the west bank. The war ended following a mutually agreed-upon ceasefire. After the war, as part of the subsequent Sinai Disengagement Agreements, Israel withdrew from the Canal, with Egypt agreeing to permit passage of Israeli ships. The canal was reopened in 1975, with President Sadat leading the first convoy through the canal aboard an Egyptian destroyer.|$|E
25|$|The {{village of}} Madeley was located {{to the west}} of the canal, but the chainmakers Edge and Company had a foundry to the east of Queen Street Bridge, and there was a China Works {{belonging}} to Martin Randall {{to the west of}} Hill's Lane bridge. Hill's Lane Colliery, to the east, was another facility served by a tramway. There was a cement mill to the east and a corn mill to the west, before the canal reached Shawfield Colliery on the east bank. A tramway crossed the canal and turned to the south, running parallel to the canal to reach Blist's Hill Brickworks. It was used to deliver pit spoil to the brickworks. Blist's Hill was a busy place, with boat building and repair sheds, brick and tile works on both sides of the canal, and Blist's Hill Furnaces, owned by the Madeley Wood Company. They were the last operational cold-blast furnaces in Shropshire. Another tramway brought coal from Meadow Pit, some distance to the north-west, to the wharf at Blist's Hill. The inclined plane at Hay was the steepest of the inclines, and descended to a short <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>canal</b> that ran eastwards, parallel to the River Severn, where goods were transhipped to river boats.|$|E
500|$|In 1766 the Duke {{gained a}} fourth act of {{parliament}} for a branch canal between Sale Moor and Stockport which was to follow {{the valley of the}} Mersey. [...] The Act was applied for to counter a proposed canal that would give the towns of Stockport and Macclesfield access to the Mersey, via the River Weaver. [...] The work was not done, the Act lapsed and this <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>canal</b> was never built.|$|E

500|$|The {{concept of}} a canal from the River Trent to Grantham was first raised on 27 August 1791, {{as a way of}} {{supplying}} the district with cheaper coal. The intent was for the navigation to join the Trent below Nottingham at Radcliffe-on-Trent. As William Jessop was surveying the Nottingham Canal at the time, he was aked to survey the Grantham route as well, and a bill was put before Parliament in 1792. It was defeated, as there was opposition from coal suppliers, who delivered coal by road to Grantham, and from those who thought that the River Witham would be damaged by the project. A revised route was developed, with the junction now at West Bridgford, and an additional [...] branch to Bingham. A second bill was put forward and the act of Parliament received the Royal Assent on 30 April 1793. Building work on the canal started in 1793, with Jessop in overall charge, but with James Green and William King as resident engineers: Green, who was from Wollaton, was appointed engineer for the <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>canal</b> from the Trent to the Leicestershire border, while King, who was the agent for the Duke of Rutland, was responsible {{for the rest of the}} canal, including two reservoirs, one at Denton and the other at Knipton on the River Devon.|$|E
500|$|A report {{entitled}} [...] "A Statement of the Situation of the Works of the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal, on the Eighteenth of December, 1795." [...] gives {{details of}} {{the progress of the}} works, including details of bridges, cuttings, raised bankings and aqueducts. [...] Much of the document details the work required to convert the canal to broad gauge. [...] A [...] length between Oldfield Lane in Salford and Giants Seat Locks in Outwood was navigable with 3ft 8in (1.12m) of water. [...] The remaining work included strengthening work to the banks, an increase of water depth to , and the gravelling of half of the towpath. [...] Between Giants Seat locks and Ringley Bridge two locks had been erected, with a small <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>canal</b> to be broadened before becoming navigable. [...] From Ringley Bridge to Prestolee Aqueduct one lock had been erected. [...] Nob End Locks were still under construction but mostly complete, although the basin at the bottom had not yet been dug. [...] The stretch to Bolton had at this time been widened, with several bridges requiring further work, incomplete embankments, construction of a weir, and gravelling of the towpath. [...] On the Bury arm, almost the entire length had been dug, and walls to support the canal along the bank of the Irwell had been built. [...] Some widening of previously narrow sections had yet to be undertaken, none of the towpath had been gravelled, and no fences had been erected along the towpath.|$|E

Initially there was a lock into the river, with a fall of [...] but since tub-boats were unsuitable for use on the river, and river boats could not use the canal, it was soon found to be redundant, and filled in. A number of warehouses were built between the canal and the river, with small inclined planes leading from the warehouses to wharfs on the river.|$|E

2500|$|The {{closure of}} the canal {{provided}} {{an opportunity for the}} Glasgow - Clydebank railway, which brought workers from Glasgow to the adjacent Thompson shipyard, to extend the line to Dalmuir. This line opened in 1896, and destroyed the first section of the canal. By 1897, there was a small <b>section</b> <b>of</b> <b>canal</b> at the northern end, which ended where a railway siding of the Glasgow, Yoker and Clydebank Railway crossed it. It had been shortened by the construction of another railway siding by 1919, although the towpath bridge was still evident. By 1937, there was no trace of the north end, as an employment exchange had been built over it. At the south end, the canal was truncated just below the first lock, where the Lanarkshire and Dunbartonshire Railway crossed it. It remained in this state in 1919, but by 1939 had been reduced by half. A small part of it was still evident in 1985, but is no longer so.|$|E
