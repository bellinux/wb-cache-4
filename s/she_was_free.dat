25|$|Falkenstein's {{experience}} with those artists reinforced {{her interest in}} abstraction, as well as ideas that functional considerations do not detract from a work's aesthetic appeal, and that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>free</b> to experiment {{with a wide variety}} of new techniques and materials.|$|E
25|$|The Variety {{sessions}} was in pre-production while Sheena was promoting Heisei Fūzoku in February 2007.

25|$|A {{review by}} the father of modern parapsychology, Dr. Joseph Banks Rhine, lent further insight into Crandon's performances. Dr. Rhine was able to observe some of her {{trickery}} in the dark when she used luminous objects. Rhine claimed to have observed Crandon committing fraud in a séance in 1926. According to Rhine, during the séance <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>free</b> from control and kicked a megaphone {{to give the impression}} it was levitating.|$|E

25|$|With Isaac in London, Mary Ann began setting about {{securing}} a financial claim to his assets by filing documents detailing his infidelities, claiming that, {{though she had}} never been formally married to Isaac, they were wed under Common Law by living together for seven months after Isaac had been divorced from his first wife Catherine. Eventually a settlement was made, but no divorce was granted. However, she asserted that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>free</b> to marry, and indeed married John E. Foster.|$|E
25|$|Possessing an {{outgoing}} {{and engaging}} personality and an active, vigorous approach to life, Weinrich promoted {{her own work}} while also helping Karl Knaths to develop relationships with potential patrons, gallery owners, and people responsible for organizing exhibitions. With him, she put herself {{in the forefront of}} an informal movement toward experimentation in American art. Since, because of her independent means, she was not constrained to make her living by selling art, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>free</b> to use exhibitions and her many contacts with artists and collectors to advance appreciation and understanding of works which did not conform to the still-conservative norm of the 1920s and 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Now a {{young adult}} financially on her own, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>free</b> to pursue her love of music and {{teaching}} {{for the next five}} years. She spent a year studying at Piedmont College in Demorest, Georgia (1915–16). She also had two stints at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore in 1917 and 1919. She returned home and helped her parents manage a hotel and taught in two mountain schools before accepting a position to be director of music at a Methodist school for girls in Huzhou, (now Wuxing, Zhejiang), China. She was not a churchgoer and did not consider herself religious, however this time abroad gave way for a pivotal moment in Smith's awareness of the Southern double standard. She studied Chinese philosophy during her time overseas and by living there was exposed to the similarities between the suppression of the Chinese and African Americans in the States.|$|E

25|$|After Lazarus {{had checked}} her gun {{and come to}} the {{interrogation}} room, they explained that this was really about some loose ends they were trying to tie up in the Rasmussen case, since her name had come up in the investigation. They claimed they wanted a private setting because while Ruetten was an old boyfriend, she was long married to someone else and did not want her private life to become the subject of office gossip. Stearns and Jaramillo knew they would have to tread carefully since Lazarus herself was well aware of police interview techniques and her rights to silence and legal counsel, which she could invoke at any time. They rambled and digressed from the subject at times, sometimes discussing unrelated police business, but eventually came back to Rasmussen. Lazarus claimed to recall little due to the intervening years, but gradually revealed more and more knowledge—including oblique acknowledgements of her visits to the Ruetten condo—until she accused her colleagues of considering her a suspect, whereupon they allowed that there was DNA evidence connecting her to the crime scene and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>free</b> to go. She left the room and was immediately arrested and charged with the murder.|$|E

500|$|By October, it was rumoured in {{high society}} and abroad that Edward {{intended}} to marry Simpson {{as soon as}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>free</b> to do so. At {{the end of that}} month, the crisis came to a head when she filed for divorce and the American press announced that marriage between her and the King was imminent. The King's private secretary, Alec Hardinge, wrote to him on 13 November, warning: [...] "The silence in the British Press on the subject of Your Majesty's friendship with Mrs Simpson {{is not going to be}} maintained... Judging by the letters from British subjects living in foreign countries where the Press has been outspoken, the effect will be calamitous." [...] Senior British ministers knew that Hardinge had written to the King and may have helped him draft the letter.|$|E

500|$|The archaic form of manus {{marriage}} {{in which the}} woman had been subject to her husband's authority was largely abandoned by the Imperial era, and a married woman retained ownership of any property she brought into the marriage. Technically she remained under her father's legal authority, even though she moved into her husband's home, but when her father died she became legally emancipated. This arrangement {{was one of the}} factors in the degree of independence Roman women enjoyed relative to those of many other ancient cultures and up to the modern period: although she had to answer to her father in legal matters, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>free</b> of his direct scrutiny in her daily life, and her husband had no legal power over her. Although it was a point of pride to be a [...] "one-man woman" [...] (univira) who had married only once, there was little stigma attached to divorce, nor to speedy remarriage after the loss of a husband through death or divorce.|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} of Debut was [...] "long and laborious", as it required Björk to realise her compositional {{ideas from the}} past ten years in a creatively autonomous fashion. Thus, after Debuts release, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>free</b> to concentrate on her present life for new musical clues for her following album. Once again, she contacted Nellee Hooper to produce the album. He refused initially, encouraging her to produce the album herself, but agreed when she insisted. However, Björk agreed to contribute to the album's production as a co-producer and to enlist other producers; [...] "to make it stay fresh, she had to think about other people being involved". With Hooper's confirmation, Björk commenced work on the album almost immediately at the Bahamas' legendary Compass Point Studios. The picturesque locale inspired the singer to meld the recording process with the exotic natural environment. Biographer Mark Pytlik writes: [...] "The tales surrounding these recording sessions are appropriately evocative". For example, Rolling Stone wrote that for her vocals: [...] "Björk extended her mic cord to a beach so she could sing to the sea". Additionally, the first version of [...] "Cover Me" [...] was recorded entirely from a nearby cave, and rumours have persisted that Björk recorded [...] "Possibly Maybe" [...] in the nude.|$|E
500|$|The {{characters}} and their stories {{served as an}} extension of the fantasy life Bannon developed as a child. They became her [...] "fantasy friends" [...] whose loves and lives she witnessed and through which she lived her own life vicariously, helping her through a difficult marriage, and a longing for a life she did not feel <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>free</b> to live. [...] "I realized very early that I should not marry, but I was going to make the best of a bad thing, and I was going to make it a good thing," [...] she remembered. Having no practical experience in a lesbian relationship while writing Odd Girl Out, she set out to gain what she termed [...] "fieldwork experience" [...] in her trips to Greenwich Village, and was successful enough to introduce those experiences into the next book in the series before relocating once more to Southern California. But she explained her fears about staying in Greenwich Village, saying I would sit there (in a gay bar) in the evenings thinking, 'What if (a police raid) happens tonight and I get hauled off to the slam with all these other women?' I had been extremely low profile, very proper, very Victorian wife. I know that sounds crazy in the 60s, but I was raised by my mother and grandmother, who really came out of that era, and talk about a rigid role-playing crowd! I couldn't imagine living through it. I just couldn't. I thought, 'Well, that would do it. I'd have to go jump off the Brooklyn Bridge.' As easy as it might be if you were a young woman in today's generation to think that was exaggerating, it wasn't. It was terrifying.|$|E

500|$|In Gortyn, epikleroi {{were also}} called patroiokos, {{and they were}} more generously treated than in Athens. The term patroiokos can be {{literally}} translated as [...] "having the father's property", and was {{a description of the}} condition of the heiress. She was considered a patroiouchoi if she had no father or brother by her father living. The relative who had the right to marry her was called a epiballon, and the list of who were eligible for that status was also limited to just her paternal uncles and the sons of those uncles. If there were no candidates fitting those conditions, the patroiouchoi was free to marry as she chose. If she wished, a patroiouchos could free herself from the obligation to marry her nearest relative by paying him part of her inheritance. If her nearest relative did not wish to marry her, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>free</b> to find a spouse in her tribe, or if none was willing, then she could marry whomever she wished. Gortyn may owe the liberality of its heiress laws {{to the fact that it}} was one of the few city-states known to have allowed daughters to inherit even if they had brothers; daughters in Gortyn received half the share of a son. To prevent the abuse of the system, there was a time limit on the right of the closest epiballon to marry her, and if the limit expired, the right passed to the next nearest epiballon until the patroiouchoi was either married or ran out of possible epiballontes. There was a limit, however, that a man could only marry one heiress. Unlike in Athens, the heiress owned her inheritance and her son did not inherit until she died. Her son was also eligible to inherit from his father.|$|E
2500|$|That same year, Robyn {{returned}} home to Sweden and discovered the electronic music brother-and-sister duo The Knife while browsing through a record store. She became inspired by how the duo self-financed and released their recordings, and bought herself out of her recording contract with Jive Records. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>free</b> from her contract, but {{did not want to}} sign with another major label because she felt that [...] "it was totally illogical. Why would I do that? I felt like either I quit making music or I start my own record company". Six months after leaving Jive Records, Robyn founded her own record label, Konichiwa Records, and began recording songs for her fourth album.|$|E
2500|$|The United Nations (UN) has {{attempted}} to facilitate dialogue between the junta and Aung San Suu Kyi. On 6 May 2002, following secret confidence-building negotiations led by the UN, the government released her; a government spokesman said that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>free</b> to move [...] "because {{we are confident that}} we can trust each other". Aung San Suu Kyi proclaimed [...] "a new dawn for the country". However, on 30 May 2003 in an incident similar to the 1996 attack on her, a government-sponsored mob attacked her caravan in the northern village of Depayin, murdering and wounding many of her supporters. Aung San Suu Kyi fled the scene {{with the help of her}} driver, Kyaw Soe Lin, but was arrested upon reaching Ye-U. The government imprisoned her at Insein Prison in Rangoon. After she underwent a hysterectomy in September 2003, the government again placed her under house arrest in Rangoon.|$|E
50|$|Godard's next film, Vivre sa vie (My Life to Live) (1962), {{was one of}} {{his most}} popular among critics. Karina starred as Nana, an errant mother and {{aspiring}} actress whose financially strained circumstances lead her to the life of a streetwalker. It is an episodic account of her rationalizations to prove <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>free,</b> even though <b>she</b> <b>is</b> tethered {{at the end of her}} pimp's short leash. In one touching scene in a cafe, she spreads her arms out and announces <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>free</b> to raise or lower them as she wishes.|$|R

2500|$|In early 2007, as Chetry's {{contract}} with Fox News neared {{the end of}} its term, the network negotiated with Chetry's agent to renew her contract. Her contract was expected to be renewed with her continuing to co-host Fox & Friends Weekend. However, talks ended when Fox News claimed in a February 15, 2007, letter to Chetry's agent, that Chetry had demanded [...] "that Fox News include a clause in her new agreement that would have been detrimental to other Fox News Talent." [...] The cable news network added that it would not renew her contract and that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>free</b> to leave before the expiration of her contract: Chetry exercised that option. Allegedly, Chetry wanted a clause in her contract that would have had Gretchen Carlson, a co-anchor of Fox & Friends, fired. Chetry's agent countered that the allegation of Chetry's wanting Carlson fired was [...] "absolutely false". [...] Another source said that the clause in question merely requested a written clarification of whether Chetry would become a [...] "Fox & Friends" [...] co-host and, if so, when. If that were not to happen by a certain date, then Chetry would have a window to exit her new contract.|$|E
2500|$|Emma {{tries to}} ignite the spark into a flame when Rumplestiltskin's manifestation appears {{and says that}} Arthur will kill her if he reunites Excalibur, {{but she says she}} has no choice and can’t risk the lives of her family.

Hayashi also noted the [...] "fresh feeling" [...] to [...] "newcomer" [...] act Tokyo Jihen that could be felt in the album. CDJournal reviewers noted the [...] "bossa-like melody turning into rock" [...] in [...] "Jusui Negai" [...] as leaving a strong impression on them, and praised Sheena's [...] "provocative and stimulating vocals" [...] in [...] "Crawl", likening the song's guitar riff to The Kinks' [...] "You Really Got Me".
