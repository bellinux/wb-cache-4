5|$|While the {{dramatic}} {{portions of the}} movie are shot in an obviously cinematic style, the bout between Balboa and Dixon is <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> number of different ways. The lead-in to the bout, {{as well as the}} first two rounds, are <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> style similar to a major pay-per-view broadcast. Clips from fights in previous Rocky movies are used during the introductory teaser to introduce Balboa, while stock footage from actual Tarver fights, as well as footage from Dixon's previous fight (shown {{at the beginning of the}} film) are used as clips for Dixon's part of the teaser. The fight itself was shot in High Definition to further enhance the TV-style look of the fight.|$|E
5|$|A song on Mahesh and Haasan was <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> set erected at Annapurna 7 Acres Studios. Another filming segment {{commenced}} at Madurai, where Haasan and Kishore {{rejoined the}} film's sets. Shooting {{then moved to}} Karaikudi. An action sequence on Mahesh and others was filmed at Pollachi in February 2015. A song choreographed by Bosco-Caesar was filmed with Mahesh and Haasan. This marked the first Telugu film of Bosco-Caesar. The filming continued at Palani until 3March 2015, after which a few scenes focusing on Mahesh, Roy, and others were shot at Hyderabad.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of series four, Meyer is <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> road-rage incident {{on his way to}} work. The culprit is later admitted to the hospital as a patient, when he crashes his car after trying to flee following the shooting. He tries to escape from the hospital in fear that the police will discover him, and after three attempts at leaving the hospital, he finally achieves his goal but collapses in the hospital car park and dies.|$|E

5|$|Eskimo was {{the first}} feature film to be <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Native American {{language}} (Inupiat), and the first feature film shot in Alaska. The film also incidentally documented many of the hunting and cultural practices of Native Alaskans. The production for the film was based at Teller, Alaska, where housing, storage facilities, a film laboratory, and other structures were built to house the cast, crew, and equipment.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{had begun}} by August1926, when several scenes were <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cave {{that had been}} {{excavated}} for the production on Karang Hill. Heuveldorp, unable to force the actors to play their roles seriously, shot several scenes with them acting as they wished before showing them the results; upon realising that their acting had been disappointing, the cast began to listen to stage directions. Afterwards they began rehearsing each scene at least twice, with Kartabrata standing behind the cameraman and giving directions.|$|E
5|$|Filming resumed on August 3, 2006 at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah for 70 {{days off}} the California coast, {{as all the}} {{shooting}} required in the Caribbean had been conducted in 2005. Davy Jones's Locker was shot at Utah, and it was <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> monochromatic way to represent its different feeling from the usual colorful environment of a pirate. The climactic battle was <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> former air hangar at Palmdale, California, where the cast had to wear wetsuits underneath their costumes on angle-tipped ships. The water-drenched set was kept in freezing temperatures, to make sure bacteria did not come inside and infect the crew. A second unit shot at Niagara Falls. Industrial Light & Magic did 750 effects shots, while Digital Domain also took on 300. They spent just five months finishing the special effects. The film posed numerous challenges in creating water-based effects.|$|E

5|$|Girlfight {{was filmed}} over 24 days in New York and New Jersey. For scenes inside the gym where Diana and Tiny train, the filmmakers <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{warehouse}} in Jersey City. The initial boxing sequences were shot from a spectator's view {{outside of the}} ring but later sequences were filmed more intimately from inside the ring. Cinematographer Patrick Cady used camera rigs that allowed the actors to hit him or the camera itself to mimic {{the feeling of being}} hit.|$|E
5|$|He next {{turned to}} the subject of wartime female factory workers in The Most Beautiful, a {{propaganda}} film which he <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> semi-documentary style in early 1944. In order to coax realistic performances from his actresses, the director had them live in a real factory during the shoot, eat the factory food and call each other by their character names. He would use similar methods with his performers throughout his career.|$|E
5|$|Howard Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after reading two articles involving suicides of servicemen in Haiti. The Haitian refugee camp was <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> derelict building in a North Vancouver shipyard; originally, the producers wanted to set the episode in Haiti and actually film in the country. This endeavor, however, proved unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|Parker and Colesberry {{looked at}} {{locations}} near Jackson, Mississippi, where {{they set up}} production offices at a Holiday Inn hotel. They also visited Canton, Mississippi before travelling to Vaiden, Mississippi, where they scouted more than 200 courthouses {{that could be used}} for filming. Parker and Colesberry had difficulty finding a small town for the story setting before choosing LaFayette, Alabama to act as scenes set in the fictional town of Jessup County, Mississippi, with other scenes being <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> number of locales in Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began in}} August 2011 in Louisiana. On November 22, 2011, {{a crew member}} died in an accident at a New Orleans warehouse that was serving as a soundstage for the production. The incident happened while crew members were changing out a set. The battle on the Himalayas was <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> New Orleans warehouse previously used to build NASA rockets, that had been fitted with a green screen wall at a very steep angle {{with a lot of}} rigging above to swing the stunt people through.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia. The neighborhood scenes were <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cul-de-sac of million-dollar homes, and production housed the residents in hotels for two nights to allow for filming. Although the sequence of Sam and Dean looking across the street as the grandfather is killed appears to be shot from {{inside one of the}} houses, the actors were actually standing on a two-story scaffolding across the street, looking through fake windows. Shots of them inside the house in the same scene made use of one of the basements.|$|E

5|$|The dinner {{scene was}} <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> revamped {{version of the}} Enterprise-D's {{observation}} lounge. Along the wall are portraits of historical figures including Abraham Lincoln, Spock's father Sarek (Mark Lenard), and an unnamed Andorian ambassador. The food prepared for the scene was colored blue so it would look alien. None of the actors wanted to eat the unappetizing dishes (especially after they grew ripe under hot studio lights), {{and it became a}} running joke among the crew during filming to make them sample their food.|$|E
5|$|The {{palatial}} {{house where}} the entire family stayed in the film is part of Ramanaidu Studios at Nanakramguda, Hyderabad. Several modifications were done by the art director, Prakash. A couple of the songs were <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> montage, another couple in Frankfurt am Main and other places in Germany and one song each in this house set and at a temple in Kakinada.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene in}} which Mulder and Doggett agree to jump from the oil platform, which was <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> way that recalls a scene in the 1969 film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, was filmed by having Patrick and Duchovny jump {{in front of a}} green screen. Separate footage of the rig exploding—created by {{combining}} actual shots of the rig with CGI—was then filmed, and the two shots were composited on top of one another.|$|E

The Puerto Rico scenes were shot a day after Stefani's concert in the city, as part of The Sweet Escape Tour, on July 19, 2007. Many parts of the video were <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> studio, including scenes of Stefani riding a motorcycle {{in front of a}} green screen.

5|$|Thiruvilaiyadal {{was entirely}} <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{specially}} erected set at Vasu Studios in Madras (now Chennai).

5|$|Tom Burstyn {{handled the}} cinematography, and the {{production}} designers were Michael Joy and Collin Niemi. James L.

The episodes were <b>shot</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> functioning asylum constructed in Montreal during the 19th century, with real patients walking around during certain scenes, which Frost said added a sense of realism to the series.|$|E
