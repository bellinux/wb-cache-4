5000|$|Dioryctria reniculelloides, the <b>spruce</b> <b>coneworm,</b> is {{a species}} of moth of the family Pyralidae. It is found from Nova Scotia to Alaska, south in the east to New York, and south {{in the west to}} California and New Mexico. It was {{recorded}} from China in 2009. Occasionally abundant, often in conjunction with epidemics of the spruce budworm, the <b>spruce</b> <b>coneworm</b> (Dioryctria reniculelloides Mutuura & Munroe) occurs through most or all of the range of spruce in North America, feeding on new foliage and cones of spruce, and often balsam fir (Ives and Wong 1988). When abundant, it can be a serious pest [...] "particularly on white spruce" [...] (Hedlin et al. 1980).|$|E
40|$|The <b>spruce</b> <b>coneworm,</b> Dioryctria abietella Denis & Schiffermüller (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), {{is a major}} pest in spruce seed {{orchards}} in Europe. Initial work on its pheromone ecology reported significant attraction of males to (9 Z, 11 E) -tetradecadienyl acetate (9 Z, 11 E- 14 :OAc), but this compound {{appeared to be a}} very weak attractant in field trials. In this study, we show that a second female-produced compound, the polyunsaturated long-chain hydrocarbon (3 Z, 6 Z, 9 Z, 12 Z, 15 Z) -pentacosapentaene (C 25 pentaene), is a strong synergist to 9 Z, 11 E- 14 :OAc, and that both compounds are needed for significant attraction of males. In field-trapping experiments, the highest catches were obtained with high amounts of pentaene added to the acetate (acetate:pentaene ratio from 1 : 10 to 1 : 30) and the highest doses (1 – 3 mg per rubber septum dispenser) were the most attractive. Two potential behavioural synergists, (Z) - 9 -tetradecenyl acetate and (9 Z, 12 E) -tetradecadienyl acetate, turned out to be behavioural antagonists and both reduced trap catch of D. abietella in a dose-dependent way when added individually to the binary blend. The recent discovery of the C 25 pentaene as a pheromone component of D. abietella, as well as of three North American congeners, suggests that the use of a mixture of so-called type I and type II pheromone compounds is a widespread motif of sexual communication within the genus. The identification of a highly attractive sex pheromone will help in developing efficient strategies for monitoring and control of D. abietella populations in European spruce {{seed orchards}}...|$|E
40|$|The sex {{pheromone}} of the cloaked pug moth, Eupithecia abietaria Götze, {{an important}} cone-feeding pest in spruce seed orchards in Europe, was investigated. Chemical and electrophysiological analyses of pheromone gland extracts of female moths and analogous analyses of synthetic hydrocarbons and epoxides of chain length C 19 and C 21 revealed (3 Z, 6 Z, 9 Z) - 3, 6, 9 -nonadecatriene (3 Z, 6 Z, 9 Z- 19 :H) and 3 Z, 6 Z-cis- 9, 10 -epoxynonadecadiene (3 Z, 6 Z-cis- 9, 10 -epoxy- 19 :H) as candidate pheromone components, which {{were found in}} a gland extract in a ratio of 95 : 5. In field trapping experiments, conspecific males were only attracted {{to a combination of}} 3 Z, 6 Z, 9 Z- 19 :H and the (9 S, 10 R) -enantiomer of 3 Z, 6 Z-cis- 9, 10 -epoxy- 19 :H. The (9 R, 10 S) -enantiomer was not attractive, which is in agreement with studies on other Eupithecia species, for which males have only been attracted by the (9 S, 10 R) -enantiomer of epoxides. Subsequent experiments showed that E. abietaria males were attracted {{to a wide range of}} ratios of the two active compounds and that trap catches increased with increasing dose of the binary blend. A two-component bait containing 300 μg 3 Z, 6 Z, 9 Z- 19 :H and 33 μg of the (9 S, 10 R) -enantiomer of 3 Z, 6 Z-cis- 9, 10 -epoxy- 19 :H was efficient for monitoring E. abietaria in spruce seed orchards in southern Sweden, where this species has probably been overlooked as an important pest in the past. With sex pheromones recently identified for two other moths that are major pests on spruce cones, the spruce seed moth, Cydia strobilella L., and the <b>spruce</b> <b>coneworm,</b> Dioryctria abietella Denis & Schiffermüller, pheromone-based monitoring can now be achieved for the whole guild of cone-feeding moths in European spruce seed orchards...|$|E
