5|$|The defense set {{the tone}} for these Giants, {{allowing}} only 236 points, second fewest in the NFL. Lawrence Taylor was the standard bearer, and set a single–season team record with 20.5 <b>sacks.</b> <b>In</b> addition to winning an unprecedented third Defensive Player of the Year Award, Taylor was named NFL MVP by the Associated Press, becoming only the second defensive player to win the award.|$|E
5|$|Fassel was {{replaced}} by current coach Tom Coughlin who has coached the team since 2004, also to inconsistent results and media scrutiny. The Giants acquired their current starting quarterback Eli Manning via a draft day trade from the San Diego Chargers. Manning had been the quarterback at University of Mississippi, {{and was the first}} pick in the 2004 NFL Draft. During this period standout Giants players include defensive end Michael Strahan, who set the NFL single season record in <b>sacks</b> <b>in</b> 2001, and running back Tiki Barber, who set a team record in rushing yards in 2005. The Giants made the playoffs four consecutive seasons, from 2005–2008 (including a Super Bowl victory during the 2007 season), but missed the playoffs in 2009 and 2010.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1990 season, Parcells, {{with whom}} Taylor had become very close, retired, {{and the team}} {{was taken over by}} Ray Handley. 1991 marked a steep decline in Taylor's production.

5|$|New York's 1988 season {{got off to}} a {{turbulent}} start due an offseason scandal involving Taylor. Taylor had abused cocaine, violating the NFL's substance abuse policy and was suspended for the first four games of the season. Taylor's over-the-edge lifestyle was becoming an increasing concern for fans and team officials. After his return, however, Taylor recorded 15.5 <b>sacks</b> <b>in</b> 12 games. The intense worry and scrutiny would prove to be for naught as {{for the rest of his}} career Taylor would pass his drug tests.|$|E

5|$|For {{the fifth}} {{game of the}} season, the Bears visited Kansas City, who trailed the Bears 5–6 in the all-time series; the game {{was the first in}} Kansas City since 2003, which the Chiefs won 31–3. Entering the game, the Bears were plagued by injuries, with 16 players listed on the injury report: Jermon Bushrod (concussion) was ruled out, safety Antrel Rolle (ankle) was doubtful, and 13 others were questionable. Jeff Joniak wrote that the offense had to be {{cautious}} of Bob Sutton's 3–4 defense, particularly the front five guided by linebacking duo Tamba Hali and Justin Houston. However, the pass rush only had nine <b>sacks</b> <b>in</b> 2015. To combat the defense, the Chiefs' cornerbacks had to be targeted, particularly Jamell Fleming and rookie Marcus Peters, who was targeted the most among cornerbacks in the NFL and four touchdowns, respectively. Additionally, the Chiefs had allowed 15 touchdowns, the most in the NFL, and in the red zone, was ranked the worst in the league. Also, the Chiefs pass defense allowed eleven passing touchdowns and 295.5 passing yards per game (ranked 28th in the league), while recording only two interceptions. The Bears defense, which had recorded six <b>sacks</b> <b>in</b> the last two games, faced an offensive line that allowed a league-high 19 sacks. Despite the struggles on the OL, Chiefs quarterback Alex Smith had receivers like Jeremy Maclin, who had recorded 148 receiving yards in the previous game, though Smith had a 49.5 completion percentage to receivers, one of the worst in the league. In the rushing attack, the Chiefs had running back Jamaal Charles, who was tied with Matt Forte for the most rushes of ten yards or more in the NFL with eleven; however, Charles had fumbled 26 times in his career, including twice in 2015. On special teams, facing former Bears ST coordinator Dave Toub, the Kansas City return unit was led by Knile Davis (kickoffs) and De'Anthony Thomas (punts); Davis ranked fourth in the NFL in KR yards, while Thomas was tied for seventh in PR yards. The Bears' coverage unit took on Pro Bowl punter Dustin Colquitt, who was ranked fourth in gross punt average and third in net average, while allowing only 51 yards on the return, along with kicker Cairo Santos led the league in field goals. Bushrod, Rolle, Alshon Jeffery, Eddie Royal, David Fales, guard Patrick Omameh and defensive end Will Sutton were inactive.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, the Giants {{made the}} playoffs for the third {{consecutive}} season. In a September game against the Eagles, they tied the NFL record for most <b>sacks</b> <b>in</b> a game by sacking Philadelphia quarterback Donovan McNabb 12 times, with Osi Umenyiora recording six of those sacks. They became the third NFL franchise to win 600 games when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons 31–10 in October. That same month, they also played in the NFL's first regular season game outside of North America, in London's Wembley Stadium, where they beat Miami 13–10. They ended the regular season 10–6 and defeated Tampa Bay 24–14 {{in the first round of}} the playoffs, earning Manning and Coughlin their first playoff victories with the Giants. The next week, the Giants won their ninth consecutive road game by beating the top-seeded Dallas Cowboys 21–17. In the NFC championship game, Lawrence Tynes kicked an overtime field goal to give them a 23–20 road victory over the Green Bay Packers.|$|E
5|$|Together, quarterbacks Jay Cutler and Josh McCown broke team {{records in}} {{touchdown}} passes, passing yards, completion percentage and passer rating with 32, 4,450, 64.4 and 96.9, respectively. Individually, in eleven games, Cutler completed 63.1 {{percent of his}} passes for 2,621 yards with 19 touchdowns, 12 interceptions and a career-high 89.2 passer rating. In the other five games, McCown completed 66.8 percent of passes for 1,829 yards, 13 touchdowns, an interception and a 109 passer rating, which ranked third in the NFL behind Denver's Peyton Manning and Philadelphia's Nick Foles. Running back Matt Forte had 1,339 rushing yards, a career-high, while wide receivers Brandon Marshall and Alshon Jeffery had 1,200 receiving yards each, as the Bears became {{the first team to}} accomplish the feat since the 2002 Buffalo Bills. Marshall was also ranked the best receiver by Pro Football Focus with a score of 37.8, 13.1 higher than Green Bay's Jordy Nelson. The offensive line was also drastically changed from its 2012 counterpart, allowing the fourth-lowest <b>sacks</b> <b>in</b> the league with 30, compared to allowing the eighth-most in 2012 with 44.|$|E
5|$|Chicago hosted Arizona in week two, the 92nd meeting all-time; the Bears, who {{possessed a}} 58–27–6 record against the Cardinals {{entering}} the game, won {{the most recent}} meeting in 2012 28–13, though Arizona won the last game at Soldier Field in 2009 41–21. The Bears faced a 3–4 defense {{for the second consecutive}} week, and the Cardinals had a blitz-heavy defense. To attack it, Jeff Joniak wrote Matt Forte would have to be utilized. When passing, the Bears had to be wary of left-side cornerback Patrick Peterson; in 2014, Arizona's opponents only threw passes of at least ten yards to that side 29 times, the fifth-lowest in the NFL. As a result, teams attempted to throw ti the right, with 51 deep passes, though only 29.4 percent were completed, the sixth-lowest in the league. Defensively, the Bears had to provide pressure to Carson Palmer, who had excelled in the season opener against the Saints with a three-touchdown game, against a line that allowed no <b>sacks</b> <b>in</b> week one, while also focusing on challenging the speed of the Arizona receivers. lineman Ego Ferguson, Ka'Deem Carey, Hroniss Grasu, Jon Bostic, Tayo Fabuluje were inactive for the game.|$|E

Meanwhile, Doggett and Harrison, having fallen into old bootlegger tunnels below the mansion grounds, encounter the creature and are sprayed with venom, temporarily blinding them. The two find Gary <b>Sacks</b> <b>in</b> {{dire need of}} medical attention nearby. Noting Doggett and Harrison's absence, Mulder searches {{the area around the}} mansion for clues and encounters the owner, Herman Stites, who identifies himself as a biologist. Mulder soon leaves the area as Stites notices Doggett about to escape the tunnels and knocks him back in. Mulder waits in his car in Stites' driveway until dark, telling Scully that he found the Apollo medallion near Stites' estate and is convinced Doggett is somewhere nearby. He spots the creature and chases it to the mansion where it climbs up to a second floor. Mulder follows the creature into the house and down into the tunnels, where he encounters Harrison and Doggett. With the creature approaching, Mulder tells the still-blinded Doggett to open fire at him on his command. The blinded Doggett then shoots the creature as it leaps at Mulder; the deceased creature then turns into Stites.|$|E
5|$|For the 1979 season, Youngblood had {{a career-high}} 18 sacks {{and was a}} {{consensus}} first-team All-Pro for the fifth time. He was voted to his seventh consecutive Pro Bowl. In 1980, he was second-team All-Pro and first-team All-NFC while leading the Rams with 11½ <b>sacks.</b> <b>In</b> 1981, Youngblood led the Rams with 12½ sacks and was the Rams outstanding defensive lineman. In the off-season, prior to the 1981 season, Jack had emergency surgery to remove a hot-dog sized blood clot from under his left arm.

Despite the broken leg and numerous other injuries, Youngblood played in 201 consecutive games, a Rams team record; and only missed one game in his 14-year NFL career. He played in seven straight Pro Bowls, five NFC Championships, and one Super Bowl. He was also the Rams' defensive captain from 1977 through 1984 and was voted the Dan Reeves award 3 times, which is awarded to the team's MVP. He had 151½ career sacks and led the Rams in sacks nine times despite playing first in assistant Coach Ray Malavasi's stop-the-run-first defensive scheme and then in his final two seasons in Defensive Coordinator Fritz Shurmur's 3-4 two-gap scheme which limited some pass rush opportunities to make sure the opponent's running game was handled.|$|E
5|$|The 3–8 San Francisco 49ers visited Soldier Field in week thirteen; in 63 all-time meetings, the 49ers {{held the}} lead 32–30–1, though the Bears {{won the last}} game in 2014 28–20. The Bears offense took on a defense {{featuring}} linebackers NaVorro Bowman, Aaron Lynch and Ahmad Brooks, who had a combined 12.5 <b>sacks</b> <b>in</b> 2015, including 6.5 by Lynch. Alshon Jeffery provided a size advantage over cornerbacks Tramaine Brock and Kenneth Acker, the duo having a combined 90 tackles, six interceptions, and 14 pass breakups. As a unit, the 49ers defense had struggled, allowing an average of 400 yards, 8.13 yards per pass (29th overall), 17 touchdown passes and a 100.5 opponent quarterback rating (also 29th-ranked). Despite these troubles, the 49ers had held the Cardinals, who had the league's best scoring offense, to just 19 points in week twelve. As for the Bears defense, the 29th-ranked rushing defense took on a running attack without Carlos Hyde. 49ers quarterback Blaine Gabbert had been improving, throwing for 318 yards against Arizona, while his top receiver Anquan Boldin had recorded 44 catches for 558 yards, 28 of which resulted in first downs. However, the San Francisco offense had the fewest points in the NFL with 152, a league-low 14 combined touchdowns, and a worst-ranked 31 plays of at least 20 yards.
