5|$|The First of the Few (also {{known as}} Spitfire in the US and Canada) (1942) was a British film {{produced}} {{and directed by}} Leslie Howard, with Howard in the starring role of R.J. Mitchell, and David Niven playing a composite character based on the Schneider Trophy pilots of 1927, 1929 and 1931, and the Supermarine test pilot Jeffrey Quill. Some of the footage includes film shot in 1941 of operational Spitfires and pilots of 501 Squadron (code letters SD). Howard <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time researching {{the history of the}} Spitfire's development for the film; Mrs. Mitchell and her son Gordon were on the set during much of the production. The aerobatic flying sequences featured in the last 15 minutes of the film were made by Jeffrey Quill in early November 1941, flying a Spitfire Mk II mocked up to represent the prototype.|$|E
5|$|The Wessex Division—now {{numbered}} as the 43rd—had {{been assigned}} for duty in India {{to free up}} regular units there, with its staff and support units held back to form {{the framework of the}} new 8th Division, which was formed from returning regular battalions. As a result, Pinney was relieved from command of his Territorial brigade in October and assigned to command the newly formed 23rd Brigade, made up from three battalions that had been on garrison duty in Malta and one from Egypt. All were regular units, with very few reservists, but having <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> period in colonial stations they were considered as only partially trained compared to the units serving with the Expeditionary Force.|$|E

50|$|The 20th Panzer Division, {{consisting}} {{of just one}} of the nominal three tank battalions, remained in the central sector of the Eastern Front, taking part in the capture of Voronezh in mid-1942 but otherwise engaged in defensive operations.

25|$|Mauros {{intended}} to organize an uprising in Thessaloniki on Easter Saturday, {{the night before}} Easter, relying {{on the lack of}} preparedness among the city's defenders. However, his plan had perhaps been revealed to the Byzantines: the Byzantine navy and its chief admiral Sisinnios arrived in the city, preventing Mauros from undertaking any military activity. When the navy anchored in Thessaloniki, Mauros appeared to fall ill and <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time in bed under the surveillance of Sisinnios. While the allegations against Mauros were never proven, he was nonetheless dispatched outside the city along with Sisinnios' men, hoping to attract new refugees from Kuber and the local Slavs.|$|E

25|$|Savile, born in Leeds, was the {{youngest}} of seven children (his elder siblings were Mary, Marjory, Vincent, John, Joan, and Christina) in a Roman Catholic family. His parents were Vincent Joseph Marie Savile (1886-1953), a bookmaker's clerk and insurance agent, and his wife, Agnes Monica Kelly (1886-1972). Savile believed he owed his life to the intercession of the Venerable Margaret Sinclair, a Scottish nun, after he recovered quickly from illness, possibly pneumonia, at the age of two when his mother prayed at Leeds Cathedral after picking up a pamphlet about Sinclair. During the Second World War he was conscripted to work as a Bevin Boy at South Kirkby Colliery in West Yorkshire, where he suffered spinal injuries in an accident and <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> period recuperating.|$|E
25|$|Thompson {{became a}} {{helicopter}} pilot {{for the oil}} industry, operating in the Gulf of Mexico. In 1988 an English documentary film producer, Michael Bilton, working for Yorkshire Television, managed to contact Thompson via his mother, who was then widowed and living in Texas. At that point Thompson had all but disappeared from public life. Bilton had contacted former crew member Larry Colburn, and put Thompson and Colburn in touch with each other after a gap of nearly 16 years. Both Thompson and Colburn {{had been trying to}} find each other, but without success. Thompson was living in Lafayette, Louisiana, and Colburn near Atlanta, Georgia. They quickly arranged a reunion. Bilton <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> weekend with Thompson discussing the events at My Lai. It proved the beginning of a long friendship which lasted until Thompson's death.|$|E

Solodkov spent 15 days underwater at 500 meters during a 1991 experiment and 25 days at 450 meters in a 1988 experiment. He was awarded the Order of the Red Banner on 25 July 1990.

25|$|One {{theory was}} {{submitted}} that Princess Doe {{may have been}} a runaway and could have been an individual using false names while employed at a hotel in Ocean City, Maryland. Six people have recently come forward with suspected identities of Princess Doe. In 2012, a sample of her hair and a tooth were examined through isotope analysis and indicated that the victim was most likely born in the United States. The sample of her hair indicated that she had lived at least seven to ten months in the Midwestern or Northeastern United States. The tooth sample indicated she could possibly be from Arizona. It is also believed that the girl had <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> period of time in Long Island, New York. After seeing images of the girl's clothing on a newspaper, a woman reported to officials that she remembered seeing a girl wearing the same clothing as Princess Doe on July 13, 1982, just two days before her body was found. The woman claimed that she was shopping with her daughter at a store across from the cemetery and observed the victim's unique clothing. The shirt and skirt themselves were traced to a manufacturer in the Midwestern United States, although the brand labels were missing. Three people reported that they bought similar clothes, after viewing photos, at a Long Island store, which is now closed. It is unknown if the store was specifically located in Long Island or possibly in other locations. The 2012 composite of the victim also generated new tips, as it resembled several missing girls from the country.|$|E

500|$|After Bateman {{signed on}} to direct the film, he and Dodge <b>spent</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time {{revising}} the script, particularly adjusting parts where the dark humor [...] "went {{a little bit too}} far".

50|$|However, {{the final}} nine games saw Wolves take just 10 points from 27 available, while Albion, in contrast, won 8 of their final 10 {{fixtures}} to overtake their rivals and pip them to promotion {{on the final}} day of the season. Jones suffered more disappointment when his side compounded their poor end to the campaign by losing their play-off semi-final to Norwich City, and their misery was complete later that month when they saw another of their local rivals, Birmingham City, gain promotion as playoff winners.
