40|$|The diversity, {{expressed}} as species richness in equal-sized samples, of wood-living beetles in successional stages of deciduous forest after forest fires approximately 100 years ago {{did not differ}} between patch sizes in this study. Thus, the crucial question for conservation is whether the lack of reduction in diversity in <b>small</b> <b>patches</b> means {{that a number of}} <b>small</b> <b>patches</b> can elevate the regional diversity as efficiently as can one larger area. In the present study, the <b>smaller</b> <b>patches</b> did not differ from larger patches in substrate availability, quality, or heterogeneity. The frequency of a group of species was measured as the number of occurrences, viz. the number of trees on which a species was found, summed over all species in the group. The number of occurrences of species unique to the specific patch-size group did not differ between large and <b>small</b> <b>patches.</b> The number of occurrences of species that preferred matrix areas (managed coniferous forest and clearcuts) was, however, larger than expected in <b>small</b> <b>patches.</b> The results indicate that <b>small</b> <b>patches,</b> although having high local (alpha) diversity, are more similar in species composition to neighboring matrix areas (reduced beta diversity). Thus, small areas contribute less to the regional (gamma) diversity than do larger areas...|$|R

30|$|Our {{parametric}} study {{confirms the}} observations of Ide and Aochi (2005). We have determined {{that the role of}} <b>small</b> <b>patches</b> during rupture propagation makes the rupture front heterogeneous, not by delaying it, but through advancing it according to the low fracture energy given that the rupture propagation is governed by the energy balance. In our model, the rupture propagation velocity is close to the S wave speed, {{and it is difficult to}} identify the effect of further advancing the rupture front on the seismic wave radiation. Nevertheless, such an effect would be evident if the rupture velocity were slower, and in fact, we observed a slight difference between case 1 of Figure  5 and case (a) of Figure  9. However, the influence on the ground motion is limited (Figure  10). Ulrich and Aochi (2014) attempted to identify different sizes of patch by inversion, but any secondary <b>small</b> <b>patches</b> were difficult to identify whereas a large patch was able to be easily characterized. This is because the radiation from the <b>small</b> <b>patches</b> tends to be hidden by the waves from the greater area of a large patch. This effect should be important when the main rupture triggers remote <b>small</b> <b>patches.</b> In other cases, the rupture of <b>small</b> <b>patches</b> should be significantly delayed. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of delayed rupture of <b>small</b> <b>patches</b> for more realistic friction laws. For example, in the case when fault strength τp is time-dependent, the rupture may be delayed according to the accumulation of strain and some relaxation process. This is in effect the same mechanism as aftershock occurrence (e.g., Dieterich 1994; Helmstetter and Shaw 2009).|$|R

25|$|These Precambrian {{rocks are}} schists and phyllites, often much contorted and disturbed. The general line of strike of the {{formations}} {{in the island}} is from north-east to south-west.} A belt of granitic rocks lies immediately north-west of the central Precambrian mass, reaching from Llanfaelog near the coast to the vicinity of Llanerchymedd. Between this granite and the Precambrian of Holyhead is a narrow tract of Ordovician slates and grits with Llandovery beds in places; this tract spreads out {{in the north of}} the island between Dulas Bay and Carmel Point. A <b>small</b> <b>patch</b> of Ordovician strata lies on the northern side of Beaumaris. In parts, these Ordovician rocks are much folded, crushed and metamorphosed, and they are associated with schists and altered volcanic rocks which are probably Precambrian. Between the eastern and central Precambrian masses Carboniferous rocks are found. The Carboniferous Limestone occupies a broad area south of Lligwy Bay and Pentraeth, and sends a narrow spur in a south-westerly direction by Llangefni to Malltraeth Sands. The limestone is underlain on the north-west by a red basement conglomerate and yellow sandstone (sometimes considered to be of Old Red Sandstone age). Limestone occurs again on the north coast around Llanfihangel and Llangoed; and in the south-west round Llanidan near the Menai Strait. Puffin Island is made of carboniferous limestone. Malltraeth marsh is occupied by Coal Measures, and a <b>small</b> <b>patch</b> of the same formation appears near Tal-y-foel Ferry on the Menai Strait. A patch of rhyolitic/felsitic rocks form Parys Mountain, where copper and iron ochre have been worked. Serpentine (Mona Marble) is found near Llanfair-yn-Neubwll and upon the opposite shore in Holyhead.|$|E
25|$|Polypropylene {{has been}} used in hernia and pelvic organ {{prolapse}} repair operations to protect the body from new hernias in the same location. A <b>small</b> <b>patch</b> of the material is placed over the spot of the hernia, below the skin, and is painless and rarely, if ever, rejected by the body. However, a polypropylene mesh will erode the tissue surrounding it over the uncertain period from days to years. Therefore, the FDA has issued several warnings on the use of polypropylene mesh medical kits for certain applications in pelvic organ prolapse, specifically when introduced in close proximity to the vaginal wall due to a continued increase in number of mesh-driven tissue erosions reported by patients over the past few years. Most recently, on 3 January 2012, the FDA ordered 35 manufacturers of these mesh products to study the side effects of these devices.|$|E
25|$|This species resembles Papilio palinurus, but {{the male}} {{generally}} has, on the upperside {{of the outer}} half of the forewing, cottony or hairy scent-streaks {{similar to those in}} Papilio polyctor, only the streak in interspace 1 is always missing. Other differences are seen in the upper wing. The forewing has the discal transverse bluish-green band slightly sinuous, narrower, more curved than in P. palinurus and more distinctly decreasing in width towards the costal margin; in the female it is more sinuous than in the male. The hindwing has the transverse bluish-green band very variable in width but the inner margin is much straighter than in P. polyctor; this band that in P. polyctor stops short of vein 7, continues to the costal margin, it is however much and abruptly narrowed above vein 7; tornal ocellus claret-red with a large black centre inwardly edged with blue; the bright ochraceous subapical lunule of P. polyctor replaced by a dull whitish spot; the subterminal diffuse green lunules restricted to interspaces 2,3 and 4; the spatular apex of the tail with a <b>small</b> <b>patch</b> of bluish-green scales.|$|E

25|$|Close to Kirkmuir (previously Laigh Kirkmuir), a farm {{occupied}} by William Mure in 1692, is the Freezeland plantation (previously Fold Park) on the turnpike as {{marked on the}} 1858 OS. Nowadays it is a smallholding without a dwelling house. The origin of the name is unclear, although 'furz' or furs' is old Scots for gorse or whin, however {{the existence of this}} <b>small</b> <b>patch</b> of fenced off land may be linked to the reference in Thomson's 1832 map to a fold, either for sheep or cattle. In 1799 the surrounding field is known as Fold Park. It could have been a pen for strayed stock or be connected with the tolls on the turnpike in some way or a 'stell', the Scot's word for a partial enclosure made by a wall or trees, to serve as a shelter for sheep or cattle. A building may have existed here. Kirkmuir was farmed by John Brown (died 21 August 1880, aged 54) and his wife Catherine Anderson (died 27 August 1895, aged 72). James Walker (died 11 December 1926, aged 86) and his wife Mary Woodburn (died 27 April 1899, aged 57) also farmed Kirkmuir. They were all buried in the Laigh Kirk graveyard.|$|E
25|$|The giant {{trevally}} {{is similar}} in shape {{to a number of}} other large jacks and trevallies, having an ovate, moderately compressed body with the dorsal profile more convex than the ventral profile, particularly anteriorly. The dorsal fin is in two parts, the first consisting of eight spines and the second of one spine followed by 18 to 21 soft rays. The anal fin consists of two anteriorly detached spines followed by one spine and 15 to 17 soft rays. The pelvic fins contain 1 spine and 19 to 21 soft rays. The caudal fin is strongly forked, and the pectoral fins are falcate, being longer than the length of the head. The lateral line has a pronounced and moderately long anterior arch, with the curved section intersecting the straight section below the lobe of the second dorsal fin. The curved section of the lateral line contains 58-64 scales, while the straight section contains none to four scales and 26 to 38 very strong scutes. The chest is devoid of scales {{with the exception of a}} <b>small</b> <b>patch</b> of scales in front of the pelvic fins. The upper jaw contains a series of strong outer canines with an inner band of smaller teeth, while the lower jaw contains a single row of conical teeth.

25|$|This species resembles Vanessa cardui but {{the ground}} colour is darker {{both on the}} uppersides and undersides, and the orange {{markings}} are deeper and richer in tint. It also differs as follows: underside forewing: the ochraceous orange-red on disc, and across cell proportionately of less extent, and uniform, not getting paler towards {{the apex of the}} cell; the upper four spots of the preapical transverse series on the black apical area minute. It is about 5inches (13cm) in length. Hindwing: the postdiscal transverse band much narrower and shorter, not extending below vein 1, margined inwardly by a series of broad black subcrescentic marks; the tornal angle with a <b>small</b> <b>patch</b> of violet scales bordered inwardly by a short black transverse line. Underside very much darker than in V. cardui, the orange red on the disc and in the cell on the forewing restricted as on the upperside; three small transversely placed blue spots beyond the cell. Hindwing: the mottling comparatively very dark, purplish blade, with slender white margins, shaded on disc with rich dark olive-brown; the postdiscal series of ocelli dark and somewhat obscure; an inner subterminal transverse series of blue, and an outer very much slenderer transverse series of black lunules. Cilia of both forewings and hindwings white, alternated with brown. Antenna black, tipped with pale ochraceous; head, thorax and abdomen with dark olive-brown pubescence; beneath, the palpi, thorax and abdomen pale ochraceous brown.|$|E

30|$|Quasi-static {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} slip along a fault interface characterized by multiscale heterogeneity (fractal patch model) {{are carried out}} {{under the assumption that}} the characteristic distance in the slip-dependent frictional law is scale-dependent. We also consider slip-dependent stress accumulation on patches prior to the weakening process. When two patches of different size are superposed, the slip rate of the <b>smaller</b> <b>patch</b> is reduced when the stress is increased on the surrounding large patch. In the case of many patches over a range of scales, the slip rate on the <b>smaller</b> <b>patches</b> becomes significant in terms of both its amplitude and frequency. Peaks in slip rate are controlled by the surrounding larger patches, which may also be responsible for the segmentation of slip sequences. The use of an explicit slip-strengthening-then-weakening frictional behavior highlights that the strengthening process behind <b>small</b> <b>patches</b> weakens their interaction and reduces the peaks in slip rate, while the slip deficit continues to accumulate in the background. Therefore, {{it may be possible to}} image the progress of slip deficit at larger scales if the changes in slip activity on <b>small</b> <b>patches</b> are detectable.|$|R
