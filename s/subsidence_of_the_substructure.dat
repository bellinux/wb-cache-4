40|$|Introduction Automated {{knowledge}} {{discovery is}} essential for extracting information from databases [2]. However, complex databases have moved from the simplistic attribute-value representation assumed by recent knowledge-discovery systems to a structural data representation that reflects the relationships among objects. Discovering concepts in this structural data requires <b>the</b> identification <b>of</b> common <b>substructures</b> within <b>the</b> data. The motivation for this process is not merely to find <b>substructures</b> capable <b>of</b> compressing <b>the</b> data by abstracting instances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>substructure,</b> but also to identify conceptually interesting <b>substructures</b> that enhance <b>the</b> interpretation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> data. <b>Substructure</b> discovery is <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> identifying concepts describing interesting and repetitive substructures within structural data. Once discovered, <b>the</b> <b>substructure</b> concept {{can be used to}} simplify the data by replacing instances <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>substructure</b> with a pointer to the newly discovered concept. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceA {{method for}} {{treating}} a complex structure as {{an assemblage of}} distinct regions, or sub-structures, is presented. Using basic mass and stiffness matrices for <b>the</b> <b>substructures,</b> together with conditions of geometrical compatibility along <b>substructure</b> boundaries, <b>the</b> method employs two forms of generalized coordinates. Boundary generalized coordinates give displacements and rotations of points along substructure boundaries and are related to <b>the</b> displacement modes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>substructures</b> known as "constraint modes. " All constraint modes are generated by matrix operations from substructure input data. Substructure normal-mode generalized coordinates are related to free vibration modes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>substructures</b> relative to completely restrained boundaries. <b>The</b> definition <b>of</b> <b>substructure</b> modes and <b>the</b> requirement <b>of</b> compatibility along substructure boundaries lead to coordinate transformation matrices that are employed in obtaining system mass and stiffness matrices from the mass and stiffness matrices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>substructure.</b> Provision is made, through a Rayleigh-Ritz procedure, for reducing <b>the</b> total number <b>of</b> degrees of freedom of a structure while retaining accurate description of its dynamic behavior.

In addition, the reaction forces acting on <b>the</b> <b>substructure</b> due to <b>the</b> very large dead load <b>of</b> <b>the</b> offshore wind turbine require very firm foundations.
