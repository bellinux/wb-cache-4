40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that discards and overexploitation produced by intense fishing activities {{are not only}} a risk for fisheries sustainability but also {{the cause of the}} marine resources decline, this involving significant changes in the trophic webs and habitats. This is especially the case of bottom trawl fisheries, and more specifically shrimp trawls, which produce average discards that can be higher than 70 % of catches. A Spanish shrimp fishery has been traditionally developed in West African fishing grounds, being especially relevant in Mauritanian waters, due to their high productivity. Since 2010, discards produced by this fishery have been studied from the information obtained through a “Program of scientific observers onboard” carried out by the Spanish Institute of Oceanography (IEO). Two annual observation cycles (2010 and 2014) have been conducted in Mauritania, giving information on catches and discards from a total of 996 (2014) and 1143 hauls (2010). More than 250 species were identified in the discards produced by this fleet. Cluster analyses and multidimensional scaling (MDS) revealed the occurrence of three well-defined assemblages, related to the depth fishery of the three main target species: one coastal shelf assemblage, in fishing depths of the southern pink shrimp Penaeus notialis (30 - 60 m depth), one slope assemblage in fishing depths of the deep-water rose shrimp Parapenaeus longirostris (90 - 300 m) and a deep slope assemblage in fishing depths of the <b>striped</b> <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> Aristeus varidens (300 - 900 m). The structure of each assemblage is presented in this work. Quantifying the bycatch and discard and identifying the main species are key steps to address a solution to effectively reduce their effects and to maintain healthy marine ecosystems.

In this paper, data on abundance (both number and biomass) of A. antennatus and A. foliacea resulting from the MEDITS surveys from 1994 to 2004, carried out with common protocols in seven Mediterranean FAO GFCM Geographical Sub Areas (GSAs), have been analyzed using standardized methodologies. Both <b>red</b> <b>shrimps</b> species occur almost exclusively on the “meso bathyal” stratum (500 800 m). The distribution pattern appears quite different for the two species, but no significant trends in density and biomass (neither at geographical nor at temporal level) could be detected. Sardinia shows the highest abundance for both species, although with some local negative tendencies along time. A very high interannual variability was detected in all areas. Comparing the present results to those recorded by Cau et al. in 2002, {{a more or less}} stable status of the deep sea <b>red</b> <b>shrimps</b> stocks was observed, which is not an encouraging finding when considering the reduction in fishing capacity and the management measures adopted by the EU in recent years...|$|R

40|$|The bloody <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> {{is a tiny}} {{freshwater}} crustacean in {{the order}} Mysidacea; more {{commonly referred to as}} mysids. Mysids are also sometimes called opossum shrimp because females typically carry their eggs in a pouch. While the effect this shrimp will have on the Great Lakes is unknown, based on its history of invasion across Europe, significant impacts are possible. Species Description These shrimp are very small, with males reaching only 8 - 10 mm and females reaching 11 - 16 mm. They have large, stalked eyes and eight pairs of legs. They are typically red to orange in color due to pigmented cells called chromatophores; however, coloration can be highly variable and change with varying light and temperature conditions. Some individuals lack color completely and are ivory or translucent. Without a microscope, the best way to distinguish the bloody <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> from other shrimp is by counting legs — it has eight pairs of legs, while most other larger shrimps and decapods have five pairs. In addition its unique swarming behavior is unlikely to be confused with anything else in the Great Lakes. With magnification, the bloody <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> has a distinctive flat-ended tail with two prominent spikes. Map created on 10 / 2 / 2012. ocean-going ships. However, mysids may also be used by aquarists as a high-nutrition food for aquarium fish, and although there are no records showing that the bloody <b>red</b> <b>shrimp</b> is used this way, it could represent a possible vector.
