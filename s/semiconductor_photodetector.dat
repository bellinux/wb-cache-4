The objective of this thesis is to develop ZnO-based <b>semiconductor</b> <b>photodetectors</b> for UV detection with low dark current, high responsivity, and fast response time. To achieve this objective, an understanding of carrier recombination and transport mechanisms of the devices is necessary by investigating their electrical properties and optical properties. The photoresponse under continuous wave excitation and pulse excitation along with the frequency photoresponse provide characterizations and useful mechanism information of the devices. These measurements are also helpful to the optimization of the structures in the UV detectors. In this thesis, various ZnO UV detectors are investigated, including ZnO photoconductors, metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) ZnO photodetectors with Ohmic contacts, post-processed MSM ZnO photodetectors with Schottky contacts, and p-i-n ZnO photodetectors. Experimental data and analysis give four unique results: (1) Very high photoelectric gain was confirmed in ZnO photoconductors. Persistent photoconductivity was observed in these detectors, which is due to carriers trapped in surface states. (2) A high gain and high speed photo-detection was validated in ZnO MSM photodetectors with Ohmic contacts. (3) A extremely low dark current and very high UV-Visible rejection was observed in ZnO MSM photodetectors with Schottky contacts.

Hot carriers injected into a semiconductor structure interact with cold carriers and excite them to higher energy states. This enables a very long-wavelength infrared response. In our experiments, we observe a response up to 55  μm, which is tunable by varying the degree of hot-hole injection, for a GaAs/AlGaAs sample with Δ =  0. 32  eV (equivalent to 3. 9  μm in wavelength) ...|$|E

40|$|Organic {{semiconductor}} technology has gained attention {{in both the}} sensor and display markets due to its low cost and simple fabrication techniques. The ability to fabricate organic semiconductor devices such as photodetectors and transistors on a flexible, lightweight substrate makes them less fragile and ideal candidates for portable large-area imaging applications. The use of organic {{semiconductor technology}} in large-area medical imaging can bring about {{a new generation of}} flexible and lightweight indirect X-ray imagers. These imagers are immune to mechanical shock and should be ideal for portable intraoral X-ray radiology. In order to realize these organic flexible imagers and their use in large-area medical imaging, many challenges associated with the device performance and fabrication need to be overcome. Among these challenges, one of the greatest is to improve the dark current performance of the organic <b>semiconductor</b> <b>photodetectors</b> (key for imager performance) with a high-photo to-dark current ratio. Low dark current is needed to improve the sensitivity of the imager, whereas a large photo-to-dark current ratio reduces noise in the extracted image.

This thesis presents a lateral multilayer photodetector design and a simplified technique to improve the dark current performance of lateral organic <b>semiconductor</b> <b>photodetectors.</b> Our technique allows us to apply a large bias voltage while maintaining a low dark current, high photo-to-dark current ratio, and improves detector speed; thus, the overall sensitivity of the detector is improved.

40|$|The {{dark current}} and {{spectral}} photoresponse thresholds of a <b>semiconductor</b> <b>photodetector</b> are normally {{determined by the}} minimum energy gap (Δ) of the material, or the interfacial energy gap of the heterostructure. In this manuscript, we discuss the performance of an asymmetric p-GaAs/AlₓGa 1 -ₓAs heterostructure-based infrared photodetector, which shows an extended wavelength threshold beyond the limit set by Δ.

40|$|Technology {{has been}} {{developed}} for a class of self-contained, long-duration power sources called beta batteries, which harvest the energy contained in the radioactive emissions from beta decay isotopes. The new battery is a significant improvement over the conventional phosphor/solar cell concept for converting this energy in three ways. First, the thin phosphor is replaced with a thick scintillator that is transparent to its own emissions. By using a scintillator sufficiently thick to completely stop all the beta particles, efficiency is greatly improved. Second, since {{the energy of the}} beta particles is absorbed in the scintillator, the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>photodetector</b> is shielded from radiation damage that presently limits the performance and lifetime of traditional phosphor converters. Finally, instead of a thin film of beta-emitting material, the isotopes are incorporated into the entire volume of the thick scintillator crystal allowing more activity {{to be included in the}} converter without self-absorption. There is no chemical difference between radioactive and stable strontium beta emitters such as Sr- 90, so the beta emitter can be uniformly distributed throughout a strontium based scintillator crystal. When beta emitter material is applied as a foil or thin film to the surface of a solar cell or even to the surface of a scintillator, much of the radiation escapes due to the geometry, and some is absorbed within the layer itself, leading to inefficient harvesting of the energy. In contrast, if the emitting atoms are incorporated within the scintillator, the geometry allows for the capture and efficient conversion of the energy of particles emitted in any direction. Any gamma rays associated with secondary decays or Bremsstrahlung photons may also be absorbed within the scintillator, and converted to lower energy photons, which will in turn be captured by the photocell or photodiode. Some energy will be lost in this two-stage conversion process (high-energy particle to low-energy photons to electric current). The geometric advantage partially offsets this as well, since the absorption depth of high-energy beta radiation is much larger than the depth of a p-n junction. Thus, in a p-n junction device, much of the radiation is absorbed far away from the junction, and the electron- hole pairs are not all effectively collected. In contrast, with a transparent scintillator the radiation can be converted to light in a larger volume, and all of the light can be collected in the active region of the photodiode. Finally, the new device is more practical because it can be used at much higher power levels without unduly shortening its lifetime. While the crystal structure of scintillators is also subject to radiation damage, their performance is far more tolerant of defects than that of semiconductor junctions. This allows the scintillator- based approach to use both higher energy isotopes and larger quantities of the isotopes. It is projected that this technology has the potential to produce a radioisotope battery with up to twice the efficiency of presently used systems...|$|E

40|$|Alternative {{plasmonic}} {{materials of}} Transparent Nitrides and Conductive Oxides (TNCOs) including Indium Tin Oxide (ITO), Al-doped ZnO (AZO) and Titanium Nitride (TiN), {{have been proposed}} as novel material platforms for Si-compatible plasmonics and metamaterials, showing enhanced light-matter interaction over a broad spectral range. It has been recently shown that these materials feature reduced optical losses compared with conventional noble metals such as Au and Ag in the visible and near-infrared spectral range. However, it is still an open challenge to tailor the structural and optical properties of these materials, and to further reduce their optical losses, in order to effectively utilize them in photonic devices. In this thesis work, I demonstrate wide tunability of the optical and structural properties of ITO, AZO and TiN thin films, by using post-deposition annealing treatments, enabling significant reduction of their optical losses. By measuring the optical bandgaps of the investigated materials, I show that the tunability of the optical properties originates from the modulation of the free carrier concentration induced by the annealing treatment. Moreover, I perform XRD characterization of the fabricated films, indicating that the annealing also effectively tunes the grain size, {{which is consistent with}} the change of the optical properties. Eventually, I investigate the role of the annealing gases for ITO and AZO, demonstrating that free-carrier modulation in ITO and AZO is due to the change in the density of oxygen vacancies after post-deposition annealing. In particular, TNCOs possess epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) condition in near-infrared range with optical loss ε^"< 1, thus providing enhanced internal fields in the medium at the ENZ condition. In collaboration with Prof. Nader Engheta and the previous post-doc in our group Dr. Antonio Capretti, we demonstrate enhanced second-harmonic generation (SHG) and third-harmonic generation (THG) from ITO thin films driven by ENZ condition. It results that the SHG generation efficiency is comparable with that of a crystalline quartz plate of thickness 0. 5 mm, and that the THG generation efficiency is ∼ 600 times larger than crystalline silicon. As an application for the fabricated TiN material, I investigate PL intensity and lifetime in Hyperbolic Metamaterials (HMMs) coupled with emitting Si Quantum Dots (QDs). In collaboration with Hiroshi Sugimoto in Prof. Minoru Fujii’s group and the previous post-doc in our group Dr. Sandeep Inampudi, we demonstrate up to 1. 6 -times enhanced decay rate of QDs emission. Photonic devices based on TNCO plasmonic materials offer an effective approach for the engineering of novel Si-based photonic devices with enhanced light-matter coupling over a broad spectral range. As an application for the fabricated ITO, in collaboration with Hongwei Zhao in Prof. Jonathan Klamkin’s group, electro-absorption modulators are numerically investigated to show high extinction ration of greater than 6 dB, while insertion loss is less than 1. 3 dB for wavelength range from 1. 25 µm to 1. 42 µm. Additionally, we demonstrate tunable optical properties of ITO thin films in mid-infrared spectrum by thermal annealing of ITO in oxygen environment. In collaboration with Sajan Shrestha and Adam Overvig in Prof. NanFang Yu’s group, we fabricate 2 D periodic arrays of ITO and show wide tuning of plasmonic resonances of ITO nanostructure from 4 µm to 10 µm. Combining with the tunability of ITO thin films in near-infrared, the ITO material platform provides a promising method for the control and engineering of Si-based tunable plasmonic and metamaterial devices in the infrared spectrum.

40|$|The {{electronic}} {{properties of}} graphene are unique and are attracting increased {{attention to this}} novel 2 -dimensional system. Its photonic properties are not less impressive. For example, this single atomic layer absorbs through direct interband transitions a considerable fraction of the light (~ 2. 3 %) over a very a broad wavelength range. However, while applications in electronics are vigorously being pursued, photonic applications have not attracted as much attention. Here, we report on ultrafast photocurrent response measurements in graphene (single and few-layers) field-effect-transistors (FETs) up to 40 GHz light intensity modulation frequencies, using a 1. 55 micron excitation laser. No photoresponse degradation is observable up to the highest measured frequency, demonstrating the feasibility and unique benefits of using graphene in photonics.

40|$|An {{important}} factor for high-speed optical communication is {{the availability of}} ultrafast and low-noise <b>photodetectors.</b> Among the <b>semiconductor</b> <b>photodetectors</b> that are commonly used in today’s long-haul and metro-area fiber-optic systems, avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are often preferred over p-i-n photodiodes due to their internal gain, which significantly improves the receiver sensitivity and alleviates the need for optical pre-amplification. Unfortunately, the random nature of the very process of carrier impact ionization, which generates the gain, is inherently noisy and results in fluctuations {{not only in the}} gain but also in the time response. Recently, a theory characterizing the autocorrelation function of APDs has been developed by us which incorporates the dead-space effect, an effect that is very significant in thin, high-performance APDs. The research extends the time-domain analysis of the dead-space multiplication model to compute the autocorrelation function of the APD impulse response. However, the computation requires a large amount of memory space and is very time consuming. In this research, we describe our experiences in parallelizing the code in MPI and OpenMP using CAPTools.

40|$|Infrared image sensors {{based on}} high density {{rectangular}} planar arrays of nano tunnel junctions have been proposed. These sensors would differ fundamentally from prior infrared sensors based, variously, on bolometry or conventional semiconductor photodetection. Infrared image sensors based on conventional semiconductor photodetection must typically be cooled to cryogenic temperatures to reduce noise to acceptably low levels. Some bolometer-type infrared {{sensors can be}} operated at room temperature, but they exhibit low detectivities and long response times, which limit their utility.

Neither bolometers nor conventional <b>semiconductor</b> <b>photodetectors,</b> the basic detector units as proposed would partly resemble rectennas. Nanometer-scale tunnel junctions would be created by crossing of nanowires with quantum-mechanical-barrier layers {{in the form of}} thin layers of electrically insulating material between them (see figure). A microscopic dipole antenna sized and shaped to respond maximally in the infrared wavelength range that one seeks to detect would be formed integrally with the nanowires at each junction. An incident signal in that wavelength range would become coupled into the antenna and, through the antenna, to the junction. At the junction, the flow of electrons between the crossing wires would be dominated by quantum-mechanical tunneling rather than thermionic emission. Relative to thermionic emission, quantum mechanical tunneling is a fast process...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} {{the problem of the}} research and development of high-speed <b>semiconductor</b> <b>photodetectors</b> suitable for operation as parts of on-chip optical interconnections together with the high-speed laser modulators based on the AIIIBV nanoheterostructures. This research is aimed at the development of the models and modelling aids designed for the simulation of carrier transport and accumulation processes taking place in on-chip photosensitive devices during the detection of subpicosecond laser pulses. Another aim of the paper is to apply the aforementioned aids for the investigation of GaAs p-i-n and Schottky-barrier photodiodes. We propose the non-stationary drift-diffusion models, an original numerical simulation technique and the applied software allowing one to simulate the photosensitive devices with different electrophysical, constructive and technological parameters. We have taken into account different kinds of carrier generation and recombination processes, the effects of electron intervalley transition and carrier drift velocity saturation in order to improve the simulation results’ adequacy. We have concluded that the influence of these effects on the performance of photodetectors for on-chip optical interconnections is significant. The response time of GaAs p-i-n and Schottky-barrier photodiodes calculated taking into account the drift velocity dependence on electric field intensity is insufficient for the adequate detection of subpicosecond laser pulses. According to the simulation results, it is reasonable to develop the methods aimed at the increase in the drift velocity of charge carriers in the photodetector active region by means of built-in electric field reduction...|$|R

The calculated R versus I result according to the measured ip values in Figure  2 b is depicted in Figure  2 c. The result shows that R increases from 360 to 7, 900 A W- 1 gradually and saturates at a near-constant level while intensity decreases from 510 to 1 W m- 2. While comparing the optimal R with that of earlier reports, the value at 7, 900 A W- 1 is over one order of magnitude higher than that (R ~ 482 A W- 1) of V 2 O 5 NWs synthesized by hydrothermal approach[2]. Even if the comparison is made at similar power densities in the range 20 to 30 W m- 2, the PVD-grown V 2 O 5 NW still exhibits higher R at approximately 2, 600 than the reference data {{by a factor of}} 5. In addition, compared to other nanostructured <b>semiconductor</b> <b>photodetectors,</b> the R of the V 2 O 5 NW device is higher than those of ZnS NBs (R ~ 0.12 A W- 1)[30], ZnSe NBs (R ~ 0.12 A W- 1)[31], ZnO nanospheres (R ~ 14 A W- 1)[32], and Nb 2 O 5 NBs (R ~ 15 AW- 1)[33] and is lower than those of GaN NWs (R ~ 106 A W- 1)[34] and ZnS/ZnO biaxial NBs (R = 5 × 105 A W- 1)[35].|$|R

30|$|As a novel {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) material, graphene {{possesses a}} unique conic band structure [1 – 3] and at low energy shows a linear energy dispersion of massless Dirac fermions [4 – 6] {{and thus is}} popularly considered for many optoelectronic and electronic applications [4]. For example, when the Fermi level of monolayer or bilayer graphene is tuned such that it is larger {{than half of the}} incident photon energy, graphene becomes completely transparent as a result of Pauli blocking [4 – 8]. This tunable property of graphene makes it highly suitable for many photonic devices [8 – 20]. A straightforward application of graphene, graphene photodetectors, has attracted numerous researchers, as graphene exhibits many advantageous behaviors compared to semiconductor counterparts [21, 22]. In addition to the aforementioned wide spectral absorption, with its high carrier mobility, graphene photodetectors are intrinsically capable of ultrafast operation not achievable by semiconductor-based detectors. The maximum bandwidth value of a reported graphene photodetector was 640  GHz [7], limited by the RC time constant of the measurement circuit. Additionally, the carrier extraction mechanism in graphene photodetectors is different from that of <b>semiconductor</b> <b>photodetectors</b> due to the built-in voltage at the metal–graphene junction [23]. Currently, photo-generated carriers extract from graphene photodetectors because the metal–graphene interfaces produce local potential variations [24]. However, the reported maximum responsivity in pure graphene photodetectors is very low (a few mA/W) [25], originating from the limited absorption (~ 2.3 %) of the thin material, the small effective detection area of graphene sheet [4], and the short photo-generated carrier lifetime due to the gapless energy bands [4 – 8].|$|R
40|$|High quantum {{efficiency}} <b>semiconductor</b> <b>photodetectors</b> have recently drawn {{the attention of}} the scientific community for their potential in the realization of a new class of scintillation imagers with very high energy and spatial resolution performance. However, this goal does not seem within easy reach, due to various technological issues such as, for example, the difficulty to scale the characteristics of a single detector to an imager with suitable dimensions. Lately a definite technical improvement in increasing {{quantum efficiency}} up to 42 % for position sensitive photomultipliers was achieved. The aim of this work is thus to test this new technological progress and to study the possible implications in imaging applications. Four Hamamatsu PMTs were tested: two multi anode photomultipliers, one with a bialkali (27 % quantum efficiency) and the other one with a super-bialkali photocathode (38 % quantum efficiency), and two 1 x 1 in. PMTs, both equipped with an ultra bialkali photocathode (42 % quantum efficiency). In particular one of the ultra bialkali PMT has also an increased efficiency of first dynode charge collection. The results were compared with the ones obtained with a reference PMT (Hamamatsu R 6231), mainly used in spectroscopy. The PMTs were coupled to LaBr 3 (Ce), NaI(Tl) and LSO(Ce) continuous scintillation crystals. The tests were done using two independent electronic chains: one dedicated for spectroscopic application and a second one, using a multi wire 64 channel readout, for imaging applications. The super-bialkali MA-PMTs have shown high energy resolution, both with spectroscopic and imaging setup, highlighting the appropriateness of these devices for the development of imaging devices with high spectroscopic performance.

40|$|Room {{temperature}} {{operation is}} mandatory for any optoelectronics technology {{which aims to}} provide low-cost compact systems for widespread applications. In recent years, an important technological effort in this direction {{has been made in}} bolometric detection for thermal imaging^ 1, which has delivered relatively high sensitivity and video rate performance (∼ 60 Hz). However, room temperature operation is still beyond reach for <b>semiconductor</b> <b>photodetectors</b> in the 8 - 12 μm wavelength band^ 2, and all developments for applications such as imaging, environmental remote sensing and laser-based free-space communication^ 3 - 5 have therefore had to be realised at low temperatures. For these devices, high sensitivity and high speed have never been compatible with high temperature operation^ 6, 7. Here, we show that a 9 μm quantum well infrared photodetector^ 8, implemented in a metamaterial made of subwavelength metallic resonators^ 9 - 12, has strongly enhanced performances up to room temperature. This occurs because the photonic collection area is increased with respect to the electrical area for each resonator, thus significantly reducing the dark current of the device^ 13. Furthermore, we show that our photonic architecture overcomes intrinsic limitations of the material, such as the drop of the electronic drift velocity with temperature^ 14, 15, which constrains conventional geometries at cryogenic operation^ 6. Finally, the reduced physical area of the device and its increased responsivity allows us, for the first time, {{to take advantage of the}} intrinsic high frequency response of the quantum detector^ 7 at room temperature. By beating two quantum cascade lasers^ 16 we have measured the heterodyne signal at high frequencies up to 4 GHz...|$|R
