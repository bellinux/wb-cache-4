[...] Mallinson <b>says</b> <b>White</b> continues to state vajroli mudra {{is a part of}} rāja yoga in the text Amanaska verse 2.32, despite corrections from other scholars in the past. Mallinson criticizes White's competence in various areas such as linguistics, dating of texts and conflating different ascetic traditions.|$|E

The college apparently told him the animal was mouse-colored and the underparts were pinkish. The animal also has a ridge of fur along the back and upper surface of the tail. Mexico City College advised the El Pasoan to write to New Mexico A&M.

40|$|EDU Fusion gets in {{the groove}} he only {{confirmed}} mechanism for protein-mediated membrane fusion involves the formation of helix bundles, in which helices attached to two membranes pack against one another to draw together the membranes. In the final fused state, six-helix bundles are formed by HIV Env and paramyxo-virus F proteins, {{members of the class}} I group of viral fusion proteins. Although the class I founding member, influenza HA, also forms a six-helix bundle, Heather Park, Jennifer Gruenke, and Judith White (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA) now show that this bundle is not sufficient for fusion. For HA, interactions between a nonhelical region and a trimer of helices cause fusion. Using mutational analyses, the group shows that fusion requires contacts between a long chain, which they call the leash, near the viral membrane with the helices near the target membrane (usually a host endosome as the virus escapes into the cytoplasm). They suggest that packing T of the leash into the grooves of the helices condenses HA, thus bringing together viral and host membranes. “There’s nothing holy about helix–helix inter-actions as a means to pull membranes together, ” <b>says</b> <b>White.</b> Membrane fusion is blocked by muta-tions in the HA leash region (right).
