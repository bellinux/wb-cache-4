40|$|This volume {{contains}} presentations {{delivered at}} the third plenary meeting of the International Collaborative Effort (ICE) on Automating Mortality Statistics held April 7 – 10, 2003 in Washington, DC. The mission of the ICE on Automation is to (1) share knowledge and experience of automated systems for coding mortality information, (2) develop and improve existing automated systems through international collaboration, (3) facilitate the transition to ICD– 10 for mortality, and (4) establish mechanisms for technical support of automated systems. At the third ICE plenary, over 80 participants from 25 countries came together to discuss these issues. The third ICE plenary meeting recognized the continuing, and largely successful, efforts to implement {{the recommendations of the}} first ICE meeting. These recommendations led to the establishment of the Mortality Forum, the WHO Mortality Reference Group, the WHO Electronic Tools Committee, the WHO <b>Subgroup</b> <b>on</b> <b>Education,</b> and the NCHS international training program on mortality coding for automated systems, all in the years following the first ICE plenary. These groups are now firmly established in the international sphere and follow a regular routine of meetings and other activities. The third plenary meeting also saw the introduction of several themes that will remain the focus of the ICE on Automation in future years: growing international collaboration on the development of automated codin...|$|E

The influx of floating population is a big supplement to the labor force in cities while the social integration process of the these out-comers is not agreeable. Limited by hukou status and related social welfare system, the floaters find themselves even more difficult to get integrated into the cities with discrimination by locals. Whether the personal willingness will work is the main question of this research. With the respective analyses of two <b>subgroups</b> based <b>on</b> different <b>education</b> background, the thesis investigates the role of willingness as well as other non-structural factors in the social integration process. The finding is that willingness to get integrated is an important factor for floating population to achieve high level of social integration, while it is not the determinative one...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to ascertain}} the professional knowledge and the skills/attributes that are considered important by external auditors for a graduate who intends to be an auditor. For this purpose, we conducted a survey on external auditors in Turkey. The research has two dimensions: skills dimension (twenty one items) and professional knowledge dimension (twenty four items). The results indicated that all skills except “knowledge of accounting software” {{are perceived to be}} important or very important for the auditing profession. Among the most important skills that graduates are expected to possess are ethics, teamwork, and honesty. The results also demonstrated that some courses are perceived to be extremely necessary, e. g. Auditing, Microsoft Office Programs, Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards, Financial Statement Analysis, Financial Accounting, Capital Market Board Regulations, Cost Accounting, and Managerial Accounting. In addition, cross analyses indicated that there are significant differences among <b>subgroups</b> based <b>on</b> gender, <b>education,</b> auditing firm, experience, and job title.

This action {{comes from a}} lift of {{the action of the}} <b>subgroup</b> <b>on</b> a trace algebra, Magnus having done a similar thing for the braid groups. We then investigate the invariant theory for this action and various representations that this action affords.

The optimized structures, total energies, energy gaps, electrochemical hardness, Fermi level, molecular symmetry, dipole moment, dipole polarizability andthe infrared spectrum frequencies were calculated. The results showed that the total energy of the two groups of molecules is independent on the position of the subgroup in the molecule but depends only on the number of the added <b>subgroups.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, the energy gap, Fermi level and the electrochemical hardness are varied with the position of the added subgroups...|$|R
