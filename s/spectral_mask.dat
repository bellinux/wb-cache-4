We show the robustness of the <b>spectral</b> <b>masking</b> techniques against four types of noise: white, pink, brown and human speech noise (bubble noise). The main contribution of this work is to analyze the performance limits of recognition systems using <b>spectral</b> <b>masking.</b> We obtain an increase of 18 % in the speech hit rate, when the speech signals were corrupted by other speech signals or bubble noise, with different signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 1, 10 and 20 dB. On the other hand, applying the ideal binary masks to mixtures corrupted by white, pink and brown noise, results in an average growth of 9 % in the speech hit rate, with the same differents signal-to-noise ratios. The experimental results suggest that the <b>spectral</b> <b>masking</b> techniques are more appropriate when applied to bubble noise, which is produced by human speech, than to white, pink and brown noise.

Numerous things can damage the complex and delicate structure of the cochlea causing hearing deficit called sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Of the two major types of hearing losses, conductive hearing loss is often corrected with surgery. On the other hand, hearing aids are the only way to compensate for SNHL. Hearing impairment affects many aspects of audition such as audibility, dynamic range, spectral and/or temporal resolution, etc., in particular if background noise is present. Enhancing spectral information of hearing-impaired people can compensate the <b>spectral</b> <b>masking,</b> which occurs due to SNHL Frequency compression {{is one of the more}} appropriate signal processing techniques to compensate for <b>spectral</b> <b>masking.</b> The primary goal of this paper is to develop an efficient technique of frequency compression using a Filter Bank Summation (FBS) method to enhance spectral information of hearing impaired people.

This leads to substantial reduction in the computational complexity, compared to general-purpose semidefinite programming methods that exploit sparsity.|$|E

We implement both off-line and real-time, low latency autonomous multitrack equalization systems to reduce masking in multitrack audio. We perform objective measurement of the <b>spectral</b> <b>masking</b> in the resultant mixes and conduct a listening test for subjective comparison between the mix results of different imple-mentations of our system, a raw mix, and manual mixes made by an amateur and a professional mix engineer.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{demonstrates}} {{power amplifier}} design using load-pull measurements to determine <b>spectral</b> <b>mask</b> compliance {{as a function}} of load impedance. In most cases demonstrated in the open literature, the spectral spreading of the device is indirectly assessed by a metric such as the adjacent-channel power ratio or third-order intermodulation product. In the present paper, a <b>spectral</b> <b>mask</b> compliance metric is introduced that is {{less than or equal to}} zero for compliant spectra and positive for non-compliant spectra. The paper first examines the load-pull measurement for the <b>spectral</b> <b>mask</b> compliance metric, including the use of averaging to smooth the contours. Direct, dual-objective design of power amplifiers for <b>spectral</b> <b>mask</b> compliance and efficiency is then demonstrated by choosing the load impedance that provides the highest measured power-added efficiency while maintaining spectral compliance. With the device terminated in the chosen optimum impedance, measurement of the output spectrum and comparison with a <b>spectral</b> <b>mask</b> are performed to demonstrate spectral compliance at the selected design impedance.

40|$|Abstract — With {{transmit}} power spectra strictly {{limited by the}} US FCC mask, the emerging ultra-wideband (UWB) communication systems call for judicious pulse shape design {{in order to achieve}} optimal spectrum utilization, <b>spectral</b> <b>mask</b> compatibility, and co-existence with other wireless services. Meanwhile, orthogonal pulse sets are often desired in order to apply high-rate multidimensional modulation and (carrier-free) orthogonal frequency division multiple access. Motivated by these considerations, we suggest a digital FIR filter approach to synthesizing UWB pulses and propose filter design techniques by which optimal waveforms that satisfy the <b>spectral</b> <b>mask</b> can be efficiently obtained. For single pulse design, we develop a convex formulation for the design of the FIR filter coefficients that maximize the spectrum utilization efficiency in terms of both the bandwidth and power allowed by the <b>spectral</b> <b>mask.</b> For orthogonal pulse design, a sequential strategy is derived to formulate the overall pulse design problem as a set of convex sub-problems, which are then solved in a sequential manner to yield a set of mutually orthogonal pulses. Our design techniques not only provide waveforms with high spectrum utilization and guaranteed <b>spectral</b> <b>mask</b> compliance, but also permit simple modifications that can accommodate several other system objectives.
