It provides a good pedal feeling to a driver, improves energy recovery and ensures braking security. This paper presents the hardware solution of the braking control system, the structure and key design parameters of a brake pedal <b>stroke</b> <b>simulator.</b> Through simulation, the energy recover rate and brake pedal feeling of drivers can be improved. The simulator can be used to realize the regenerative braking system in hybrid or electric vehicles...|$|E
