5|$|As {{the end of}} war {{approached}} and hostilities with the Sioux Indians loomed, Raynolds's knowledge of and experiences in the Great Lakes region became {{more important to the}} army than his command of the fortifications of Harpers Ferry.

40|$|A {{household}} <b>survey</b> <b>and</b> {{a census}} {{can be combined}} to estimate a poverty map for small areas. Ideally, the <b>survey</b> <b>and</b> the census should be conducted in the same year.

Using data from the Vietnam Household Living Standard <b>Survey</b> 2002 <b>and</b> the 1999 Population and Housing Census, the present paper produces a 2002 poverty map for Vietnam and describes the biases when the <b>survey</b> <b>and</b> census years are not coincident.

Watches were used and adjusted each evening using the GMT time check. One major problem faced early on by the LRDG {{was a lack of}} accurate maps for Libya in particular.

5|$|Covered Bridges Today is a non-fiction {{book on the}} {{architecture}} of covered bridges in the United States. The book was written by Brenda Krekeler and published by Daring Books in 1989. Covered Bridges Today is a frequently cited source {{on the topic of}} covered bridges and serves as a record of numerous covered bridges that have since been dismantled or demolished since the book's publication. Krekeler's text includes 412 covered bridges in fourteen states with a complete record of all 142 covered bridges in Ohio during its writing in 1986 and 1987. The work has been utilized in numerous citations by later publications including Historic American Engineering Record <b>surveys</b> <b>and</b> New England's Covered Bridges: A Complete Guide, Indiana Covered Bridges and Covered Bridges in Virginia.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, DSHD {{initiated}} traffic <b>surveys</b> <b>and</b> {{studies to}} inform plans {{to construct a}} four-lane divided highway south from Dover. The studies, completed in 1942, found that US13 from Delmar to Dover carried significantly more traffic than US113 from Selbyville to Dover, so DSHD started planning for the divided highway to the Maryland state line to be along the US13 corridor. However, DSHD also approved plans for expansion of US113 to a divided highway from Milford to Little Heaven. DSHD completed the final link in the DoverDelmar divided highway in 1957. As in Delaware, Maryland SRC prioritized completing expansion of US13 to a four-lane highway from Virginia to Delaware, which was completed in 1966. By that time, {{only a small portion}} of US 113 around Berlin had been expanded to a divided highway.|$|E

The Berkshire breed has increased significantly in number, partially due to international demand for its meat, while other breeds have shown significant decreases, most likely due to increasing consolidation of the pork industry to large producers who use only a few specialized pork strains. Breeds such as the Chester White and Poland China have seen population numbers reduced by over 25 percent between 1998 and 2003, while the Hampshire and Yorkshire breeds have decreased by more than 30 percent in the same time.|$|E
