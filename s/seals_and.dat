Phocids (earless seals) {{are known to have}} existed for at least 15 mya, and molecular evidence supports a divergence of the Monachinae (monk <b>seals)</b> <b>and</b> Phocinae lineages 22 mya.|$|E

5|$|Lek {{systems are}} known to exist among some populations of walruses. These males cluster around females and try to attract them with {{elaborate}} courtship displays and vocalizations. Lekking may also exist among California sea lions, South American fur seals, New Zealand sea lions and harbor seals. In some species, including elephant <b>seals</b> <b>and</b> grey seals, males will try to lay claim to the desired females and defend them from rivals. Elephant seal males establish dominance hierarchies with the highest ranking males—the alpha males—maintaining harems {{of as many as}} 30–100 females. These males commonly disrupt the copulations of their subordinates while they themselves can mount without inference. They will, however, break off mating to chase off a rival. Grey seal males usually claim a location among a cluster of females whose members may change over time. Male harp seals, crabeater <b>seals</b> <b>and</b> hooded seals follow and defend lactating females in their vicinity—usually one or two at a time,—and wait for them to reach estrus.|$|E

5|$|Like many seabirds storm petrels will {{associate}} with {{other species of}} seabird and marine mammal species {{in order to help}} obtain food. It is theorised that they benefit from the actions of diving predators such as <b>seals</b> <b>and</b> penguins which push prey up towards the surface while hunting, allowing the surface feeding storm petrels to reach them.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds {{are also}} {{threatened}} by humans indirectly. They are unintentionally caught in fishing nets by commercial fisheries and accidentally swallow fishing hooks. Gillnetting and Seine netting {{is a significant}} cause of mortality in <b>seals</b> <b>and</b> other marine mammals. Species commonly entangled include California sea lions, Hawaiian monk seals, northern fur <b>seals</b> <b>and</b> brown fur seals. Pinnipeds are also affected by marine pollution. High levels of organic chemicals accumulate in these animals since they are {{near the top of}} food chains and have large reserves of blubber. Lactating mothers can pass the toxins on to their young. These pollutants can cause gastrointestinal cancers, decreased reproductivity and greater vulnerability to infectious diseases. Other man-made threats include habitat destruction by oil and gas exploitation, encroachment by boats, and underwater noise.|$|E

5|$|Several {{species of}} {{pinniped}} {{continue to be}} harvested. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals allows limited hunting of crabeater seals, leopard <b>seals</b> <b>and</b> Weddell seals. However, Weddell seal hunting is prohibited between September and February if the animal is over one year of age, to ensure breeding stocks are healthy. Other species protected are southern elephant seals, Ross <b>seals</b> <b>and</b> Antarctic fur seals. The Government of Canada permits the hunting of harp seals. This has been met with controversy and debate. Proponents of seal hunts insist that the animals are killed humanely and the white-coated pups are not taken, while opponents {{argue that it is}} irresponsible to kill harp seals as they are already threatened by declining habitat.|$|E
