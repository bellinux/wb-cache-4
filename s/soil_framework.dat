40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a set of 22 triaxial tests on an unsaturated artificially cemented sand. The results are used to explore the applicability of a number of unsaturated <b>soil</b> <b>frameworks</b> for interpreting the shear strength. Constant water content triaxial tests were carried out on unsaturated specimens, using the axis translation technique to measure suctions during shearing. The test results on the unsaturated material were referenced against a series of drained and undrained triaxial tests that were carried out on saturated specimens. The results of the unsaturated tests were analysed to investigate the effect of the suction and degree of saturation on the shear strength at the critical state. The results show that the critical state stress ratio in terms of net stress (Ma) was found to be larger than the saturated critical state stress ratio (Ms). It was also found that the stress ratio in terms of suction (Mb) reduced as suction increased (when the degree of saturation reduced below 30 %). Interestingly, during the initial desaturation phase when the degree of saturation reduces considerably, the stress ratio Mb was largely unaffected by desaturation. It was only when the suction increased sufficiently that the micro-voids within the cementing material could start to desaturate that a reduction in Mb was seen. This occurred at suctions in excess of the residual suction when the global degree of saturation was changing very little. This implies that the suction is contributing to the strength of the cementing material itself...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{management}} {{is fundamental to}} all agroecosystems and affects ecosystem processes {{that are involved in}} the provision of multiple ecosystem services (ES). Agricultural soils are the habitat for key functional organisms which collectively as soil biota contribute to soil ES provision: supporting biomass production and nutrient cycling, regulating of climate, water and biological control of pests and diseases. As result of an increased awareness on the importance of soil ES, soil science is playing an active role in informing the ecological intensification of agriculture. In this study, the lessons learned from Italian case studies on the usefulness of using a <b>soil</b> health assessment <b>framework</b> based on multiple soil ES are presented. Soil health as an integrative property of agroecosystem management can be evaluated with a set of physical, chemical, and biological indicators representative of essential soil ES. This is the basis of the <b>Soil</b> Management Assessment <b>Framework</b> (SMAF) (Andrews et al., 2004) and it is based on a three-step process that includes indicator selection, indicator interpretation, and integration into a final index. In northern Italy, several field trials have been set up to assess multiple ES provision from bioenergy crops cultivated on marginal conditions and from contrasting vegetable cropping systems. These studies revealed how the use of a comprehensive <b>soil</b> health assessment <b>framework</b> can help: (1) to identify the best soil management practices that deliver multiple ES and (2) to support resource-efficient production. Beyond academic research, the integration of multiple indicators of soil health within the assessment of agroecosystems sustainability is essential if we want to promote ecological intensification of food and bioenergy production...|$|R
40|$|Understanding the distribution, {{behaviour}} {{and interactions}} of complex chemical mixtures is key for providing the evidence {{necessary to make}} informed decisions and implement robust remediation strategies. Much of the current risk assessment frameworks applied to manage land contamination are based on total contaminant concentrations and the exposure assessments embedded within them do not explicitly address the partitioning and bioavailability of chemical mixtures. These oversights may contribute to an overestimation of both the eco-toxicological effects of the fractions and the mobility of contaminants. In turn, this may limit the efficacy of risk frameworks to inform targeted and proportionate remediation strategies. In this review we analyse the science surrounding bioavailability, its regulatory inclusion and the challenges of incorporating bioavailability in decision making process. While a number of physical and chemical techniques have proven to be valuable tools for estimating bioavailability of organic and inorganic contaminants in soils, doubts have been cast on its implementation into risk management <b>soil</b> <b>frameworks</b> mainly due to a general disagreement on the interchangeable use of bioavailability and bioaccessibility, and the associated methods which are still not standardised. This review focuses on the role of biotic and abiotic factors affecting bioavailability along with soil physicochemical properties and contaminant composition. We also included advantages and disadvantages of different extraction techniques and their implications for bioavailability quantitative estimation. In order to move forward the integration of bioavailability into site-specific risk assessments we should (1) account for soil and contaminant physicochemical characteristics and their effect on bioavailability; (2) evaluate receptor's potential exposure and uptake based on mild-extraction; (3) adopt a combined approach where chemical-techniques are used along with biological methods; (4) consider a simplified and cost-effective methodology to apply at regulatory and industry setting; (5) use single-contaminant exposure assessments to inform and predict complex chemical mixture behaviour and bioavailability...|$|R

Three common temporal approaches to equilibrium – 24 -, 48 - and 72 -h – are examined, for a grassland and arable <b>soil.</b> The <b>framework</b> highlights the differences in equilibrium duration between the two soils. For both soils, the 24 -h treatment significantly overestimated saturation. For the arable site, no significant difference was observed between the 48 - and 72 -h treatments. Hence, a 48 -h treatment was sufficient to determine ‘effective equilibrium’. For the grassland site, the 48 - and 72 -h treatments differed significantly. This highlights that a more prolonged duration is necessary for some soils to conclusively determine that effective equilibrium has been reached. This framework can be applied to other soils to determine the optimum centrifuge durations for SWCC construction. </p...|$|R

It is conceivable to accomplish these results if there are satisfactory soil cation trade destinations accessible to retain the Ca particle discharged from the PR, or if Ca is drained far {{from the site of}} PR disintegration. A measure of the cation trade destinations accessible for Ca adsorption is the contrast between the cation trade limit of soils and the interchangeable Ca. Recent ponders propose that high replaceable magnesium (Mg) in soils may upgrade PR disintegration (Vanlauwe et al. 2000). Hypothesis would propose that, as Mg is held by soils more firmly than Ca, the nearness of Mg on the dirt trade locales can piece the adsorption of Ca discharged on disintegration of PR and in this way encourage its expulsion from the <b>soil</b> manure <b>framework.</b> This will improved PR disintegration. In soils with low pH (under 5.5), the interchangeable Ca and Mg will constantly be low base saturation. and consequently, there will be low solution content of these ions.|$|R
