50|$|The {{difference}} between baud (or signalling rate) {{and the data}} rate (or bit rate) is like a man using a single semaphore flag who can move his arm to a new position once each second, so his signalling rate (baud) is one symbol per second. The flag can be held in one of eight distinct positions: Straight up, 45° left, 90° left, 135° left, straight down (which is the rest state, where he is sending no signal), 135° right, 90° right, and 45° right. Each <b>signal</b> (<b>symbol)</b> carries three bits of information. It takes three binary digits to encode eight states. The data rate is three bits per second. In the Navy, more than one flag pattern and arm can be used at once, so the combinations of these produce many symbols, each conveying several bits, a higher data rate.|$|E

This method extracts baseband {{signal from the}} generated BPSK modulated signal by means of different ways, utilizing the modulus of wavelet transformation coefficients of this baseband signal to construct a singular pulse sequence consistent with the code rate of original modulated signal. Theoretical analysis on the power spectrum of this singular pulse sequence indicates that there exist discrete spectral lines in the integral multiples of baseband <b>signal</b> <b>symbol</b> rate, thus detecting these discrete spectral lines can achieve the estimation of <b>signal</b> <b>symbol</b> rate.

In addition, digital phase modulation is also used in HF data communication such as in PACTOR II/III, CLOVER 2000, STANAG 4285, and MIL STD 188 - 110 A/B format [4].

40|$|The {{transition}} to symbolic information from images involves {{in general the}} loss or misclassification of information. One {{way to deal with}} this missing or wrong information is to get feedback from concrete hypotheses derived at a symbolic level to the sub-symbolic (signal) stage to amplify weak information or correct misclassifications. This paper proposes such a feedback mechanism between the symbolic level and the signal level, which we call <b>signal</b> <b>symbol</b> loop. We apply this framework for the detection of low contrast edges making use of predictions based on Rigid Body Motion. Once the Rigid Body Motion is known, the location and the properties of edges at a later frame can be predicted. We use these predictions as feedback to the signal level at a later frame to improve the detection of low contrast edges. We demonstrate our mechanism on a real example, and evaluate the results using an artificial scene, where the ground truth data is available...|$|E

In developing his theorem, Claude Shannon effectively separated the transmitted signal from the information being carried. Note that it says nothing about bandwidth or filtering of the signal, or the complexity of the code. And although it says you can establish near-errorless communications, it says nothing about the net data rate (throughput) of that communications after coding is applied. As described in [2], “What Shannon says here is that in a noise channel, errorless communication (not errorless transmission!) can occur as long as two conditions are met: first, that the information rate R is below a certain value C; and second, that a sufficiently capable code is being used. ” The type of idealized assumption made by Shannon to create a mathematical basis for his theorem is common, but there are always practical factors for achieving system performance that approaches the ideal limit.

40|$|Blind channel {{identification}} and equalisation are the {{processes by which}} a channel impulse response can be identified and proper equaliser filter coefficients can be obtained, without knowledge of the transmitted signal. Techniques that exploit cyclostationarity can reveal information about systems which are nonminimum phase; nonminimum phase channels cannot be identified using only second-order statistics (SOS), because these do not contain the necessary phase information. Cyclostationary blind equalisation methods exploit the fact that, sampling the received signal at a rate higher than the transmitted <b>signal</b> <b>symbol</b> rate, the received signal becomes cyclostationary. In general, cyclostationary blind equalisers can identify a channel with less data than higher-order statistics (HOS) methods, and unlike these, no constraint is imposed on the probability distribution function of the input signal. Nevertheless, cyclostationary methods suffer from some drawbacks, such {{as the fact that}} some channels are unidentifiable when they exhibit a number of zeros equally spaced around the unit circle. In this thesis the performance of a cyclostationary blind {{channel identification}} algorithm combined with a maximum-likelihood sequence estimation receiver is analysed. The simulations were conducted in the pan-European mobile communication system GSM environment and the performance of the blind technique was compared with conventional channel estimation methods using training. It is shown that although blind equalisation techniques can converge in a few hundred symbols in a time-invariant channel environment, the degradation with respect to methods with training is still considerable. Yet, the fact that a dedicated training sequence is not needed makes blind techniques attractive, because the data used for training purposes can be re-allocated as information data. In the concluding part of this thesis a new blind channel identification algorithm which combines methods that exploit cyclostationarity implicitly and explicitly is presented. It is shown that the properties of cyclostationary statistics are exploited in the new algorithm, and enhance the performance of the technique that solely exploits fractionally-spaced sampling. The algorithm is robust in the presence of correlated noise and interference from adjacent users...|$|E

Simulation results showed that CQSM outperformed QSM and generalized SM (GSM) by approximately 5 and 4. 5 dB, respectively, for the same transmission rate. Its performance was similar to that of QSM; however, it achieved higher transmission rates.
