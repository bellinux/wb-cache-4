5|$|Metcalfe {{resigned}} his <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> on June 1, 1828 {{in order}} {{to run for the}} governorship of Kentucky.

He defeated William T. Barry by a margin of 709 votes, but his running mate, Joseph R. Underwood, was badly defeated by the Democratic-Republican nominee, John Breathitt. Metcalfe's election in 1828 marked the first time the governorship had been won by a candidate who was not a Democratic-Republican. However, only one Democratic-Republican would hold the office between Metcalfe's term and the election of Lazarus W. Powell in 1851.|$|E
5|$|Sharp was re-elected to the Fourteenth Congress, {{during which}} he served as {{chairman}} of the Committee on Private Land Claims.

When the next congressional session opened in December 1816, Sharp reversed his position and voted to repeal the law, but the damage was already done; he lost his <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> in the next election.|$|E

5|$|After the election, Weaver {{returned}} to the lame-duck session of Congress and proposed an unsuccessful constitutional amendment that would have provided for the direct election of Senators.

That same year, Weaver ran for his old 6th district <b>seat</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> against the incumbent Republican, MarsenaE. Cutts. This time the Democrats and Greenbackers ran separate candidates, and Weaver finished a distant second.
