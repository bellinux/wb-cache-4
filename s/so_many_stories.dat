I'm battered quite brutally at the beginning of the video, but at the end, I'm not battered; I'm a bit strange.

This motivated him to write a novel centered on two Afghan women.|$|E
5000|$|Andrew Clark from ThreeIfBySpace {{says that}} the season opener was weak. [...] "I was {{disappointed}} with the content and was left still {{waiting for something to}} happen that never did. ... The plot for this episode jumped around multiple times. In my opinion there are too <b>many</b> <b>story</b> arcs going on at the same time ... With <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>story</b> arcs {{there is a lot of}} content, but not exclusive to one arc.

500|$|Paramount Pictures {{dropped its}} {{original}} {{protest against the}} film after their director Ivan Reitman, re-titled his film No Strings Attached. Screen Gems then moved forward with the title Friends with Benefits. At the same time, NBC was developing a sitcom with the same title, but the movie production company stated that due to its production schedule, they didn’t expect an issue to arise. Screen Gems chose to accelerate production fearing that they would lose their title to the competing Paramount project. Director Will Gluck spoke about the frustration of comparing the two films, stating: [...] "I wish there was more space between them. The thing that's irking me now is people are saying we're remaking No Strings Attached. We're not remaking it. The two movies were being made at the same time." [...] Gluck, {{in an interview with}} The New Zealand Herald, said that both films are different. Similar sentiments were expressed by Kunis, stating, [...] "It's just two different movies. There's only [...] <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>stories</b> you can tell in the world. This {{is just one of the}} many." ...|$|E

[...] He felt the character of Maria was [...] "cartoonishly one note ... it’s heartbreaking to watch Yo-Yo stand quietly as her friends unknowingly denounce her", and compared the use of Yo-Yo's powers to [...] "a small-screen version of that great Quicksilver scene from ... it’s still pretty cool". Alex McLevy of The A.V. Club graded the episode a 'B+', feeling the action-heavy episode was a strong follow up to the more dialogue-focused [...] "Meet the New Boss", and praising Martens direction and the episode's fight choreography. He particularly highlighted the fight sequence where an EMP creates a strobe effect. Evan Valentine at Collider.com rated the episode a [...] "good" [...] 3 stars out of 5, calling it a solid episode and highlighting the chemistry between the series' cast and the episode's fight sequences and visual effects, which he felt were [...] "a nice and breezy combination of the show’s strengths".|$|E
500|$|Days after announcing Raimi's departure, {{the studio}} {{announced}} that Webb, whose previous film (500) Days of Summer was his directorial debut, would direct the reboot. Tolmach, {{now president of}} Columbia Pictures and Amy Pascal, co-chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, said they looked for a director who could give sharp focus to Parker's life. Webb said he [...] "was a little sceptical at first—you feel the presence of those other movies. But then I was like, 'How could I walk away from this? What an opportunity!'" [...] Webb said in the press release announcing him that, [...] "Sam Raimi's virtuoso rendering of Spider-Man is a humbling precedent to follow and build upon. The first three films are beloved for good reason. But I think the Spider-Man mythology transcends not only generations but directors as well. I am signing on not to 'take over' from Sam. That would be impossible. Not to mention arrogant. I'm here because there's an opportunity for ideas, stories, and histories that will add a new dimension, canvas, and creative voice to Spider-Man." [...] Webb felt Spider-Man {{is different from the}} Harry Potter franchise, which is based on a few novels and [...] "more like James Bond" [...] because [...] "there's so much material in Spider-Man that there are <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>stories</b> to tell and so many characters." [...] He described the film as [...] "not a remake" [...] explaining that [...] "we're not making Sam's movie again. It's a different universe and a different story with different characters." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Hunt {{indicates}} {{that she had}} no great musical talent, she worked as a singer for 18 months after arriving in England. In February 1967, Hunt took a singing job with Alexis Korner's trio [...] "Free at Last" [...] so that she could earn her fare back home. She did not use it, but remained, and in 1968, joined the group The Ferris Wheel. That same year, Hunt achieved national fame in England when she appeared as [...] "Dionne" [...] in the rock musical Hair, a box-office smash on the London stage. Hunt only had two lines of dialogue in Hair, but she attracted a lot of media attention and her photo appeared in many newspapers and magazines. Her photograph was used on the poster and playbill of the original London production, photographed by Justin de Villeneuve. Hunt says that the role was a perfect fit for her, expressing who she actually was. She was one of three Americans featured in the London show, and when the show began she had no contract to perform. When the show opened she was featured in <b>so</b> <b>many</b> <b>stories</b> that she was offered a contract right away.|$|E
