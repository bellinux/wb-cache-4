At one time the rock lobsters on Tristan da Cunha were believed to be a separate species known as the Tristan rock lobster (Jasus tristani), but the use of mitochondrial DNA sequencing has shown them to be identical. Some authorities, for example the IUCN, retain them as separate species. The Tristan rock lobster features on the coat of arms and the flag of Tristan da Cunha.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION Saint <b>Paul's</b> <b>Rocks</b> (Penedos de São Pedro e São Paulo) are a {{small group}} of rocky islets on the mid-Atlantic ridge near the equator, occupying an area of roughly 250 by 425 m. There is no {{vegetation}} and, apart from birds and invertebrates, the islands are uninhabited. The Cambridge Expedition to Saint <b>Paul's</b> <b>Rocks</b> visited the group from 16 to 24 September 1979 and made extensive collections of the terrestrial and marine fauna; these included a number of Crustacea. The Decapoda and Stomatopoda of <b>St</b> <b>Paul's</b> <b>Rocks</b> are the subject of the present paper. Few detailed studies have been published to date on the Crustacea of <b>St</b> <b>Paul's</b> <b>Rocks,</b> largely because of the Rocks' remoteness and inhospitable nature. Crustacea, especially the common and conspicuous rock crab Grapsus grapsus, have been mentioned in several narratives and popular accounts, but the only material on which scientific reports have been based is that collected by H. M. S. "Challenger" in 1873. The Challenger reports mention eight species of Decapoda (5 Macrura, 1 Anomuran and 2 Brachyura) from <b>St</b> <b>Paul's</b> <b>Rocks.</b> The Cambridge Expedition collected nine species of Decapoda (2 Macrura and 7 Brachyura) and one species of Stomatopoda; in addition one macrurous decapod was observed but not collected. The total number of species of Decapoda now known from <b>St</b> <b>Paul's</b> <b>Rocks</b> amounts to fifteen (6 Macrura, 1 Anomuran and 8 Brachyura); Stomatopoda, not previously reported from the area, are represented by a single species.

40|$|Crystalline pargasite-rich spinel {{peridotite}} mylonite from <b>St.</b> <b>Paul's</b> <b>Rocks</b> containing 5. 7 % water {{bound in}} hydrous minerals was reacted in sealed platinum capsules in a piston-cylinder apparatus from 10 - 30 kb. At 10 kb the subsolidus assemblage is amphibole, olivine, orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene and spinel, an amphibole lherzolite; with increasing pressure garnet appears at 18 kb, spinel and amphibole disappear at about 25 kb; the resulting high pressure assemblage {{is that of}} a garnet lherzolite. The solidus was located in the presence of water-rich vapor, but vapor dissolves completely in the liquid at higher temperatures, and the liquid becomes water-undersaturated. Stability limits in the melting interval were determined for amphibole, garnet, spinel, clinopyroxene, orthopyroxene, and olivine (the liquidus mineral). The results are consistent with a published conclusion that <b>St.</b> <b>Paul's</b> <b>Rocks</b> is a diapiric, solid-state mantle intrusion initially mobilized at a depth between 45 km and 70 km near 1, 000 - 1, 050 °C. An estimate of the solidus of peridotite with 0. 2 % water is presented and compared with other studies. At intermediate pressures this solidus is determined by the breakdown of amphibole. Discrepancies among results of the various studies probably arise at least in part from experimental problems involved in the complex systems...|$|R
