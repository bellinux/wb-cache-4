25|$|To {{calculate}} the bands including electron-electron interaction many-body effects, one can resort to so-called Green's function methods. Indeed, {{knowledge of the}} Green's function of a system provides both ground (the total energy) and also excited state observables of the system. The poles of the Green's function are the quasiparticle energies, the bands of a solid. The Green's function can be calculated by solving the Dyson equation once the self-energy {{of the system is}} known. For real systems like solids, the self-energy is a very complex quantity and usually approximations are needed to solve the problem. One such approximation is the GW approximation, so called from the mathematical form the self-energy takes as the product Σ = GW of the Green's function G and the dynamically screened interaction W. This approach is more pertinent when addressing the calculation of band plots (and also quantities beyond, such as the <b>spectral</b> <b>function)</b> and can also be formulated in a completely ab initio way. The GW approximation seems to provide band gaps of insulators and semiconductors in agreement with experiment, and hence to correct the systematic DFT underestimation.|$|E

On a lattice with a finite spatial extent, <b>spectral</b> <b>functions</b> consist of discrete spectra only. Adopting a variational method, we calculate the locations and the heights of <b>spectral</b> <b>functions</b> at low-lying discrete spectra. We first test the method {{in the case of}} analytically solvable free Wilson quarks at zero and finite temperatures and confirm that the method well reproduces the analytic results for low-lying spectra.

We then apply the method to calculate the charmonium <b>spectral</b> <b>functions</b> for S and P-wave states at zero-temperature in quenched QCD and compare the results with those obtained using the conventional maximum entropy method (MEM). The results for the ground state are consistent with the location and the area of the first peak in <b>spectral</b> <b>functions</b> from the MEM, while the variational method leads to a mass which is closer to the experimental value for the first excited state.

5000|$|An {{extensive}} {{study of}} inverse scattering problems {{is given in}} {{a long series of}} papers (see monographs, and papers,) where a summary of some of the author’s results is given. In a recent paper [...] the problem which has been open for many decades is solved: uniqueness of the solution to a non-overdetermined inverse scattering problem is proved. Exact inversion of low-frequency scattering data is given in the book. [...] A powerful method, Property C method, based on the notion of completeness of the set of products of solutions of PDE is developed and applied to many important inverse problems. In these works several problems are solved which have been open for decades. For example, the first global uniqueness theorems in geophysics and potential scattering with fixed-energy data are obtained, the first mathematically justified method for solving the 3D inverse scattering problem with noisy fixed-energy data is given, and, for the first time, stability estimates for the solution to the inverse scattering problem with noisy fixed-energy data are obtained.The first variational principle for solving inverse scattering problems which is equivalent to the inverse problems was found; this work is published as a monograph, which is an expanded version of monograph, translated into Russian in 1994. Very recently (paper [...] ) a fundamentally new uniqueness theorem is obtained: it says that a compactly supported real-valued square-integrable spherically symmetric potential is uniquely defined by any part of the fixed-energy phase shifts with the angular momenta [...] running through an arbitrary set [...] of non-negative integers such that [...] Property C is defined and proved for ordinary differential equations (ODE) and its many new applications are demonstrated. Most of the known results for one-dimensional inverse problems are obtained by using this property, and many new results. Among the classical results which are obtained by using property C for ODE are Marchenko and Borg’s uniqueness theorems concerning recovery of the potential from two spectra and from scattering data or <b>spectral</b> <b>function.</b> Inverse problems for an inhomogeneous Schrödinger equation are studied for the first time, a non-over-determined three-dimensional inverse problem of recovery of a potential from the diagonal values of the <b>spectral</b> <b>function</b> known on the boundary of a bounded domain and all real values of the spectral parameter is considered and a uniqueness theorem is proved for this problem. [...] A new approximate method for solving the inverse scattering problem with fixed energy data is given for a spherically symmetric potentials which are known for r > a but unknown for , where [...] is an arbitrary large fixed number. Numerical results are obtained by this method. Krein’s method in inverse scattering is justified and its consistency is proved. Analytical theory is given for inversion of the surface scattering data in the ground-penetrating radar problem for two functions: permittivity and conductivity of the ground, under the assumption that these functions depend on the vertical coordinate only,. A method for recovery of a quarkonium system from experimental data is developed. Inverse problem of finding point scatterers from the surface scattering data is posed and solved. For the first time uniqueness theorems are proved for three-dimensional scattering problems with non-overdetermined data. Stability of the Pompeiu property is established [...] and further results are obtained. In papers [...] and [...] a method for constructing a ”smart material” is given. It is proved that one can distribute small particles in a bounded domain so that the resulting material has the a priori chosen radiation pattern. Moreover, a method for calculating the density of these particles and their properties is developed. In paper [...] theory of scalar wave scattering by one and many small bodies of an arbitrary shape is developed for various boundary conditions (Dirichlet, Neumann, impedance, transmission). In paper [...] theory of EM (electromagnetic) wave scattering by one and many small impedance bodies of an arbitrary shape is developed. Methods for creating materials with a desired refraction coefficient are given {{on the basis of the}} above theory.|$|E
5000|$|Neutron {{spin echo}} is a {{time-of-flight}} technique. Concerning the neutron spins {{it has a}} strong analogy to the so-called Hahn echo, [...] well known in thefield of NMR. In both cases the loss of polarization (magnetization) due to dephasing of the spins in time is restored by an effective time reversal operation,that leads to a restituation of polarization (rephasing). In NMR the dephasing happens due to variation in the local fields at positions of thenuclei, in NSE the dephasing is due to different neutron velocities in the incoming neutron beam.The Larmor precession of the neutron spin in a preparation zone with a magnetic field before the sample encodesthe individual velocities of neutrons in the beam into precession angles. Close to the sample the time reversal is effected by a so-calledflipper. A symmetric decoding zone follows such that at its end the precession angle accumulated in the preparation zone is exactly compensated(provided the sample did not change the neutron velocity, i.e. elastic scattering), all spins rephase to form the [...] "spin-echo". Ideally the full polarization is restored. This effect {{does not depend on}} the velocity/energy/wavelength of the incoming neutron. If the scattering at the sample is not elastic but changes the neutron velocity, the rephasing will become incomplete and a loss of finalpolarization results, which depends on the distribution of differences in the time, which the neutrons need to fly through the symmetric first (coding) and second (decoding)precession zones. The time differences occur due to a velocity change acquired by non-elastic scattering at the sample. The distribution of these time differences is proportional (in the linearization approximation which is appropriate for quasi-elastic high resolution spectroscopy) to the spectral part of the scattering function S(Q,&omega;). The effect on the measured beam polarization is proportionalto the cos-Fourier transform of the <b>spectral</b> <b>function,</b> the intermediate scattering function F(Q,t). The time parameter depends on the neutronwavelength and the factor connecting precession angle with (reciprocal) velocity, which can e.g. be controlled by setting a certain magneticfield in the preparation and decoding zones. Scans of t may then be performed by varying the magnetic field.|$|E
