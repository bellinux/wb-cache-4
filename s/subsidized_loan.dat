We construct institution-specific changes in program maximums as the interaction of an institution exposure to the maximums in each aid program (the fraction of qualifying students) and the legislated program maximums. We find that institutions that were most exposed to these maximums ahead of the policy changes experienced disproportionate tuition increases around these changes, with effects of changes in institution-specific program maximums of Pell Grant, <b>subsidized</b> <b>loan,</b> and unsubsidized loan of about 40, 60, and 15 cents on the dollar, respectively.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} two {{different aspects of}} human capital accumulation: early childhood development and tertiary education. Specifically, it analyzes the role that public policies or changes in regulations affect incentives of agents {{in a way that}} ends up affecting the aggregate endowment of human capital in an economy. ^ The first chapter is related to early childhood development. Recent literature has shown that skills shaped during childhood have long lasting consequences later in life. This fact has promoted a large number of programs aimed at stimulating the skill formation process for children in disadvantage. However, little is known about how cost-effective are these policies. In this chapter I evaluate the cost-effectiveness of three alternative policies aimed at improving the living standards of families in disadvantage: cash transfers, childcare subsidies, and subsidies for child investments. I find that subsidies promoting child investments are much more productive than the other two alternatives. ^ In the second chapter, co-authored with David Zarruk, we analyze the consequences that subsidized loans for higher education have on the quality of education offered by colleges {{in the context of a}} developing country. We find that subsidized student loan policies lead to a widening gap in the quality of services provided by higher education institutions. This happens because the demand for elite institutions unambiguously increases when individuals can borrow. This does not happen in non-elite institutions, since relaxing borrowing constraints makes some individuals move from non-elite to elite institutions. The higher increase in demand for elite institutions allows them to increase prices and investment per student. If investment and average student ability are complementary inputs in the quality production function, elite universities also increase their acceptance cut-offs. In this new equilibrium, the differentiation of the product offered by colleges increases, where elite universities provide higher quality education to high-ability students and non-elite universities offer lower quality to less-able students. We calibrate the model to Colombia, which implemented massive student loan policies during the last decade and experienced an increase in the gap of quality of education provided by elite and non-elite universities. We show that the increase in the quality gap can be a by-product of the <b>subsidized</b> <b>loan</b> policies. Such results show that, when analyzed in a general equilibrium setting, <b>subsidized</b> <b>loan</b> policies can have negative effects in equilibrium. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine how German {{cooperative}} banks, (non-cooperative) private credit banks and savings banks {{contribute to the}} long-term loan financing of young and small firms. Bank loans, especially long-term bank loans, are often used by young and small firms in Germany. We focus on {{a specific type of}} loan. The assignment of these loans to firms involves cooperative banks, private credit banks or savings banks. The loans come from public <b>subsidized</b> <b>loan</b> programs and constitute a substantial part of all long-term bank loans to young firms and SME in Germany. We present empirical analyses for the 1990 s based on county-level as well as firm-level data. We find that private credit banks did not change their lending to young and small firms during that period. Since the start of the 1990 s, they have played only a minor role in start-up and small business lending. Cooperative and savings banks have had, in contrast, a strong, positive influence. One particularly relevant finding is that the lending activities of cooperative and savings banks turn out to be similarly strong and do not differ significantly. Taken together, our results imply that having banks that operate regionally with a decentralized organizational form, but not public ownership, is crucial to the observed lending activities. ...|$|E

Since then, the understanding of the long-term risk of DCI perc use to human, environmental and economic health has evolved. The phase out of DCI perc use in NC dry cleaning now has demonstrated value. This study uses discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis to evaluate a <b>subsidized</b> <b>loan</b> program that would encourage the phase out of the use of perc by NC dry cleaners. It incorporates two higher economic value gains of a perc phase out into the analysis, the decrease of real estate and public health costs. In addition, this study takes an interdisciplinary approach – combining research findings and methods from the fields of toxicology, law, finance and economics – to provide further recommendations on how to drive productive DCI regulatory change in North Carolina. The analysis results support two key findings. First, the net benefit of phasing out perc equipment is in North Carolina’s economic interest. Second, the net gain of a phase out is sufficient to finance a program to subsidize dry cleaners to convert to non-perc alternatives. However, the value of a non-perc dry cleaning machine subsidy can only be captured if the implementation process and participation rate are designed and carried out effectively...|$|E

40|$|For decades, {{law school}} administrators, faculty members, {{students}} and graduates have {{worried about the}} problem of the ever-increasing cost of attendance at the nation’s law schools, and the rapidly rising average debt of graduating law students. The problem was particularly acute for students who desired careers in public service, because starting salaries in the government and non-profit sectors failed {{to keep pace with the}} increase in educational debt of law school graduates. In response, many law schools created loan repayment assistance programs (LRAPs), through which they <b>subsidized</b> <b>loan</b> repayment for some or all of their graduates who undertook public service jobs or careers. Most of these programs are insufficiently funded to meet the needs of their graduates who desire to use them, and demand for financial assistance for lower-income graduates has particularly accelerated as the recession that began in 2008 caused private sector firms to reduce their hiring, prompting more student interest in public sector employment. In addition, many law schools had no LRAP programs at all. Fortunately, Congress has significantly alleviated this problem, passing four laws between 2005 and 2010 that collectively reduce the debt repayment burdens on graduates, particularly (though not exclusively) those in public service. The new legislation also makes it possible for law schools to create or restructure LRAP programs in a way that provides a great deal of debt relief to graduates in public service at the lowest possible cost to the law school. As of this writing (in the summer of 2010), at least seven law schools—the University of California at Berkeley, Georgetown, UCLA, Duke, Northwestern, Virginia, and Suffolk—have altered their LRAP programs to take maximum advantage of the federal legislation, and several others are currently considering modifications. This article, together with an associated web-based calculator, provides guidance for law school administrators and faculty members who desire to coordinate law school LRAP benefits with those provided by federal law, and for law students and alumni who might want to suggest LRAP improvements to their schools...|$|E

40|$|The first paper {{demonstrates}} {{the important role}} of job displacement in the household bankruptcy decision. Consistent with predicted filing behavior under persistent income shocks, I find that households in the NLSY are four times more likely to file in the year following job loss, with a smaller but significant response persisting two to three years. Aggregate patterns are also consistent with the model: At the county level, 1000 job losses are associated with 8 - 11 bankruptcies, the effects also last two to three years, and manufacturing job loss is more likely to induce bankruptcy than non-manufacturing job loss. The results suggest that providing credit counseling to vulnerable households at the time of displacement may be more effective than providing it at the time of bankruptcy. Theories of financial intermediation suggest that securitization reduces financial intermediaries' incentives to screen borrowers. The second paper, co-authored with Tanmoy Mukherjee, Amit Seru, and Vikrant Vig, examines this question using a unique dataset of securitized subprime mortgage loans. We exploit a rule of thumb in the lending market to generate exogenous variation in the ease of securitization and compare the composition and performance of lenders' portfolios around this threshold. Conditional on securitization, a portfolio that {{is more likely to be}} securitized defaults by 20 % more than a similar risk profile group. Crucially, these two portfolios have similar observable risk characteristics and loan terms. Our results suggest that securitization can adversely affect lenders' screening incentives. The third paper, co-authored with Brian C. Cadena, uses insights from behavioral economics to offer an explanation for a surprising phenomenon: Nearly 20 percent of undergraduate students who are offered interest-free loans turn them down. We model the financial aid process and show that students facing self-control problems may optimally decline subsidized loans to avoid excessive consumption during school. Using the NPSAS, we investigate students' financial aid situations and <b>subsidized</b> <b>loan</b> take-up decisions and find that students who would receive their loans in cash are significantly more likely to reject the loan. These results suggest that consumers limit their liquidity in economically meaningful situations, consistent with the predictions of the behavioral model...|$|E
