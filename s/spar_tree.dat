50|$|A <b>spar</b> <b>tree</b> is {{the tree}} {{used as the}} highest anchor point in a high lead cable logging setup. The <b>spar</b> <b>tree</b> was {{selected}} based on height, location and especially strength and lack of rot in order to withstand the weight and pressure required. Once a <b>spar</b> <b>tree</b> was selected a climber would remove the tree's limbs and top the tree (a logging term for cutting {{off the top of}} the tree). Block and tackle was affixed to the tree and the cabling was run.|$|E

50|$|Although the Cook Creek <b>Spar</b> <b>Tree</b> was {{cut down}} in 1955 due to rot, another lookout tree remains, {{constructed}} in 1918 near Darrington, Washington. Abandoned as a lookout in the 1930s, {{it can be}} reached by the Lookout Tree Trail.|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>spar</b> <b>trees</b> in logging is now rare, {{having been}} {{replaced}} since the 1970s by portable towers, called Yarders, {{which can be}} erected on logging sites and moved as needed.|$|R

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this {{dissertation}} was to develop and pilot test interactive, multimedia courseware which would facilitate learning the abstract structures, operations, and concepts associated with graph and network data structures in Computer Science. Learning objectives and prerequisites are presented in an introduction section of the courseware {{and a variety of}} learning activities are provided including tutorials, animated demonstrations, interactive laboratory sessions, and self-tests. Courseware development incorporated principles and practices from software engineering, instructional design, and cognitive learning theories. Implementation utilized an easy-to-use authoring tool, NeoBook Professional (1994), to create the overall framework and the user interfaces, and Microsoft QuickBASIC 4. 5 (1990) to program the interactive animated demonstrations and laboratory exercises. A major emphasis of the courseware is the use of simple interactive, animated displays to demonstrate the step-by-step operation of graph and network algorithms such as depth-first traversal, breadth-first traversal, shortest path, minimum <b>sparring</b> <b>tree</b> and topological ordering...|$|R
5000|$|Lookout {{trees were}} {{widely used in}} the Kaibab National Forest of {{northern}} Arizona, and Washington, USA {{as well as in}} Australia. The Dave Evans Bicentennial Tree in Western Australia reaches 75m, while the tallest lookout in the United States was the Cook Creek <b>Spar</b> <b>Tree</b> near Lake Quinault, Washington, USA, at 179 ft high from 1927 to 1955.|$|E
50|$|He began drawing {{cartoons}} {{while working}} as a logger, doing work for Vancouver's Maple Leaf Publishing during World War II and comic strips about logging for BC Lumberman magazine. He retired from logging in 1961 and began work as a commercial fisherman. In 1972 he began work on Now You're Logging to document logging in the era before modern technology. A complete picture is presented of the techniques and lives of the typical logger of the 1930s, with tree felling and log bucking, high climbers, chasers, choker setters, a hooktender, an accident and rescue in the woods, the use of the crosscut saw, rigging, a <b>spar</b> (<b>tree),</b> log transport on both truck and water, and operation of the steam donkey all shown and explained. This depiction of logging is interwoven with a love story involving one of the loggers and the daughter of a fishing family near their logging camp.|$|E
5000|$|The Washington Winch {{operated}} {{either a}} high lead or a skyline system. The high lead system was not {{often used as}} it only partially lifted the logs off the ground, which caused the logs to become caught in rocks, and left behind a [...] "snig track", which deepened over time. The skyline system involved two large <b>spars</b> (<b>trees)</b> {{used to create a}} [...] "flying fox" [...] to lift logs over the rough ground. Riggers climbed 60m up a large tree and headed the trunk, which would cause the tree to sway violently. They then secured the spar with guy cables and attached the tackle. This operation was dangerous and physically demanding, often taking a full day, with lunch sent up on a rope. The Washington Winch was used to harvest Alpine Ash which would then be used for high-value products such as furniture, flooring and architraves.|$|R
5000|$|The {{division}} of labor in lumber camps led to several specialized jobs on logging crews, such as whistle punk, chaser, and high climber. [...] The whistle punk's job was to sound a whistle (usually at the Steam donkey) as {{a signal to the}} yarder operator controlling the movement of logs. He also had to act as a safety lookout. A good whistle punk had to be alert and think fast as the safety of the others depended on him. The high climber (also known as a tree topper) used iron climbing hooks and rope to ascend a tall tree in the landing area of the logging site, where he would chop off limbs as he climbed, chop {{off the top of the}} tree, and finally attach pulleys and rigging to the tree so it could be used as a spar so logs could be skidded into the landing. High climbers and whistle punks were both phased out in the 1960s to early 1970's when portable steel towers replaced <b>spar</b> <b>trees</b> and radio equipment replaced steam whistles for communication. The choker setters attached steel cables (or chokers) to downed logs so they could be dragged into the landing by the yarder. The chasers removed the chokers once the logs were at the landing. Choker setters and chasers were often entry-level positions on logging crews, with more experienced loggers seeking to move up to more skill-intensive positions such as yarder operator and high climber, or supervisory positions such as hook tender. Despite the common perception that all loggers cut trees, the actual felling and bucking of trees were also specialized job positions done by fallers and buckers. Faller and bucker were once two separate job titles but are now combined.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{accidents}} {{in the period}} 1998 – 2008 reported during harvesting operations in ÖBf AG, Austria’s largest forest enterprise, {{with a focus on}} cable yarding. In total 1888 accidents were recorded with 8. 7 % of these associated with cable yarding activities. The overall accident rate amounted to 36 incidents per million cubic meter extracted by cable yarder. There was a clear spike in accidents between 2 and 3 pm. Most accidents occurred onWednesdays and Mondays (26 and 25 %, respectively). The four months of March, June September and November accounted for 45 % of all accidents. The majority of accidents (63. 2 %) were caused by broken <b>spar</b> and anchor <b>trees,</b> bouncing cables and falling objects. Frequently injured body parts were the extremities such as hand and feet (64 %) and the head and neck area (15. 2 %). Contusions (37. 8 %) are the most common kind of injury followed by bone fractures (12. 8 %), sprain or strains (11. 6 %) and punctures or lacerations (10. 4 %). An average cable yarding accident required 17. 9 days for recovery, compared to the 25. 6 days for manual extraction and 29. 7 days for extraction by means of a tractor or skidder. Accident severity varied among body parts: eye injuries resulted in three lost work days, while injured extremities required 20 days for recovery. During wood extraction, some stems with branches may be unhooked and fall down. In this case, the accidents caused are the most severe needing 27 days for recovery...|$|R
