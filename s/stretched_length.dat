In air, the C 60 molecular junction did not show any well-defined conductance value. In either mesitylene or HClO 4 solution, the systems showed a conductance value of 0. 01 G 0. The <b>stretching</b> <b>length</b> {{of the single}} C 60 molecular junction {{was determined to be}} 0. 01 nm.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{interpret}} recent {{experimental studies of}} the dependence of conductance of ds-DNA as the DNA is pulled from the 3 ′end 1 – 3 ′end 2 ends, which find a sharp conductance jump for a very short (4. 5 %) <b>stretching</b> <b>length,</b> we carried out multiscale modeling to predict the conductance of dsDNA as it is mechanically stretched to promote various structural polymorphisms. We calculate the current along the stretched DNA {{using a combination of}} molecular dynamics simulations, non-equilibrium pulling simulations, quantum mechanics calculations, and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. For 5 ′end 1 – 5 ′end 2 attachments we find an abrupt jump in the current within a very short <b>stretching</b> <b>length</b> (6 Å or 17 %) leading to a melted DNA state. In contrast, for 3 ′end 1 – 3 ′end 2 pulling it takes almost 32 Å (84 %) of stretching to cause a similar jump in the current. Thus, we demonstrate that charge transport in DNA can occur over <b>stretching</b> <b>lengths</b> of several nanometers. We find that this unexpected behaviour in the B to S conformational DNA transition arises from highly inclined base pair geometries that result from this pulling protocol. We found that the dramatically different conductance behaviors for two different pulling protocols arise from how the hydrogen bonds of DNA base pairs break...|$|R

50|$|Muscle fibers {{can only}} {{contract}} up to 40% of their fully <b>stretched</b> <b>length.</b> Thus the short fibers of pennate muscles are more suitable where power rather than range of contraction is required. This limitation {{in the range}} of contraction affects all muscles, and those that act over several joints may be unable to shorten sufficiently to produce the full range of movement at all of them simultaneously (active insufficiency, e.g., the fingers cannot be fully flexed when the wrist is also flexed). Likewise, the opposing muscles may be unable to stretch sufficiently to allow such movement to take place (passive insufficiency). For both these reasons, it is often essential to use other muscles, called fixators or synergists, in this type of action to fix certain of the joints so that others can be moved effectively, e.g., fixation of the wrist during full flexion of the fingers in clenching the fist. Synergists are muscles that facilitate the fixation action.|$|E

The F 1 cross hoggets used for the comparison of the wool producing ability, wool yield and characters of 5 Corriedale hoggets were 6 Corriedale × Southdown, 6 Corriedale × Romney Marsh and 3 corriedale × Border Leicester F 1 cross hoggets. Wool yields(grease fleece and clean fleece yield) and wool characters(wool fineness, <b>stretched</b> <b>length</b> of wool, number of crimps and wool density) at about 9 months after birth between the Corriedale and F 1 cross hoggets born in spring were compared in 1959 and 1960. The results obtained are summarized as follows; (1) No significant differences in grease fleece and clean fleece yield between the Corriedale breed and F 1 crosses were observed. However, the fleece yields of the Romney Marsh and Border Leicester F 1 crosses were higher than the Corriedale breed, while the fleece yield of the Southdown F 1 cross lower than the Corriedale breed. (2) There {{was no significant difference in}} the wool fineness between the Corriedale breed and F 1 crosses, except in the wool fineness(significant at 0. 1 % level) between the Corriedale breed and Border Leicester Fl cross. The wool fineness of the Romney Marsh and Border Leicester F 1 crosses was greater than the Morrisdale breed, while the wool fineness of the Southdown F 1 cross a little smaller than the Corriedale breed. (3) Difference in the <b>stretched</b> <b>length</b> of wool between the Corriedale breed and F 1 crosses, except in the <b>stretched</b> <b>length</b> of wool(significant at 1 % level) between the Corriedale breed and Southdown Fl cross, was not significant. The <b>stretched</b> <b>length</b> of the Romney marsh and Border Leicester F 1 crosses was greater than the Corriedale breed, while the <b>stretched</b> <b>length</b> of the Southdown F 1 cross smaller than the Corriedale breed.

The effects of input voltage, the <b>stretch</b> <b>length</b> and cutter holding force on the amplitude of the ultrasonic vibration used were measured. The effect of ultrasonic frequency (25 and 50 kHz) and amplitude (0, 2. 20 and 3. 68 μm) as well as the effect of the rake angle (6 ° and − 6 °) and the cutter helix angle (25 °, 35 ° and 45 °) on tool wear and quality of the workpiece surface finish were also investigated. It was found that the ultrasonic amplitude increased with cutter <b>stretch</b> <b>length</b> and input voltage, as expected. The amplitude remained constant when the cutter holding force exceeded 15 N. The experimental results showed that the ultrasonic amplitude had an optimum value with respect to surface finish. However, large amplitude ultrasonics did not necessarily improve quality. Furthermore, the cutters used for ultrasonic-assisted milling show less wear than those used for normal milling.

40|$|Purpose: The human male urethra {{has great}} {{capacity}} to extend under traction. This extensi-bility {{is the principle}} of some surgical techniques used to overcome urethral defects and for penile lengthening. However, to our knowledge safe limits of urethral extensibility in reconstructive surgery have not been yet established by a morphological study. To this end we measured fresh human cadaveric urethras with and without traction. Materials and Methods: We analyzed the macroscopically normal, fresh cadaveric urethra from 25 men 6 months to 73 years old at death (mean age 30. 6). Penile length and length of the total, penile, bulbar and membranous urethra were measured. Length under maximal constant trac-tion and the maximal <b>stretched</b> <b>length</b> without penile curvature at artificial erection were determined. Extensibility is expressed as the percent {{of the variation in}} initial length at rest and maximal constant traction length. Maximal <b>stretched</b> <b>length</b> without penile curvature at artifi-cial erection is expressed as a percent of maximal constant traction length.

40|$|Shallow {{intertidal}} habitats are recognised {{as critical}} for larval and juvenile fish, {{and are often}} assumed to function as refuge areas where predation risk is reduced. Yet there is growing evidence that suggest these areas may also be regularly inhabited by large bodied fish and {{be the site of}} high levels of juvenile fish predation. In the present study we examined the use of an intermittently available surf zone habitat in tropical northern Australia by a diverse community of large-bodied teleosts (mean total length 444 mm), sharks (mean total <b>stretched</b> <b>length</b> 658 mm) and rays (mean total <b>stretched</b> <b>length</b> 1, 108 mm). Drawing on the methods and ecological knowledge of a local commercial fishery, gillnets were used to capture fish as they entered the surf zone on the flooding tide. Monthly surveys over a one-year period revealed a dynamic assemblage consisting of 30 species of teleosts (mostly caught as adults) and 14 species of sharks and rays (mostly caught as juveniles or young of the year). Although it is unclear why these fish use this habitat, we conclude that it may support a broad range of biological benefits including spawning for teleosts, parturition for elasmobranchs, as well as foraging and refuge. The unique findings of this study highlight existing knowledge gaps and the need to better understand what fish use the intertidal zone and why. This should be a high priority given the increasing anthropogenic pressures on coastal margins...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{proposed}} a stretchable radio frequency (RF) sensor to detect strain direction and level. The stretchable sensor is composed of two complementary split ring resonators (CSRR) with microfluidic channels. In order to achieve stretchability, liquid metal (eutectic gallium-indium, EGaIn) and Ecoflex substrate are used. Microfluidic channels are built by Ecoflex elastomer and microfluidic channel frames. A three-dimensional (3 D) printer is used for fabrication of microfluidic channel frames. Two CSRR resonators are designed to resonate 2. 03 GHz and 3. 68 GHz. When the proposed sensor is stretched from 0 to 8 mm along the +x direction, the resonant frequency is shifted from 3. 68 GHz to 3. 13 GHz.
