Oxygen volume fraction gradient was used to characterize oxygen supplying rate in roadway according to situation that the velocity of wind flowing is very low during <b>smoldering</b> in roadway.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this work}} has been to {{investigate}} the effects of density, heat flux and boundary conditions on <b>smoldering.</b> Two focus areas were chosen: the onset of <b>smoldering</b> and the transition from <b>smoldering</b> to flaming fire. Methods: Experiments using cotton batting were chosen to study <b>smoldering</b> combustion. Cotton was chosen since it can easily be compressed {{to a range of}} densities. Cotton, being mainly cellulose, is a material prone to <b>smoldering.</b> The cotton was compacted to a predetermined density and heated from below using a hotplate. Five densities were investigated: 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 kg/m 3, with six heat flux scenarios and two sets of boundary conditions. Findings: Results from paper I and II show that density affects the onset of <b>smoldering.</b> Samples with high density had lower ignition temperature than samples with lower densities. The temperature for onset of <b>smoldering</b> was reduced from 318 ◦C to 303 ◦C as the density of cotton was increased from 40 to 100 kg/m 3. Here, the cotton was heated with high heat flux for 15 minutes and then the hotplate was switched off (Scenario A). In paper II it is shown that heat flux has an impact on the onset of <b>smoldering,</b> but not on the <b>smoldering</b> process as such. A low constant heat flux for 4 to 5 hours leads to ignition at 284 ◦C (Scenario D), while a high heat flux for 15 minutes gives 303 ◦C (Scenario A). Samples exposed to a continuous low constant heat flux have lower onset temperature than samples exposed to high heat flux for a short time. In paper III two boundary conditions were tested with four densities: 20, 60, 80 and 100 kg/m 3. A solid boundary (a wall) along one of the vertical sample sides leads to reduced <b>smoldering</b> velocity locally, probably as a result of more restricted oxygen transport into the sample. <b>Smoldering</b> velocities that differ spatially make it possible for <b>smoldering</b> and secondary char oxidation to coexist in the sample. The <b>smoldering</b> produces gaseous fuel and the secondary char oxidation ignites the gas, leading to flaming combustion. Conclusion: Density affects the onset of <b>smoldering,</b> the <b>smoldering</b> combustion and the transition from <b>smoldering</b> to flaming. The heat flux scenario affects the onset of <b>smoldering,</b> but not the <b>smoldering</b> process. The boundary affects the spatial propagation of <b>smoldering</b> in a sample, and through it the transition from <b>smoldering</b> to flaming fire. </p...|$|R

40|$|An {{experimental}} study and asymptotic analysis {{were conducted to}} investigate <b>smoldering</b> propagation in a horizontally oriented layer of flexible polyurethane foam. Experiments were done in a small-scale wind tunnel, where the air current is flush with the upper surface of the foam layer. The activation energy asymptotic approach was applied to analyze <b>smoldering</b> propagation. The experimental results show that increasing the air flow over the foam's surface not only enhances the mass transfer of oxygen to the <b>smoldering</b> reaction zone, but also increases the heat loss to the surroundings. The maximum <b>smoldering</b> propagation rate was observed at medium flow rates of air. The variation of the steady <b>smoldering</b> temperature with the flow rate followed the same trend {{as that of the}} <b>smoldering</b> propagation rate. Both adiabatic and non-adiabatic conditions were considered in the asymptotic analysis. For the adiabatic case, it is shown that the <b>smoldering</b> propagation rate and the <b>smoldering</b> temperature both increase with the flow rate of air. Results from the adiabatic analysis show that an increase in the density of the porous material lowers the <b>smoldering</b> propagation rate. Increasing the concentration of ambient oxygen, the porosity of the porous material or the mass transfer coefficient of the air stream increases the <b>smoldering</b> propagation rate. Results from the nonadiabatic analysis show a similar trend. Consistency is observed between the analytical results and the experimental measurements. (C) 2003 The Combustion Institute.

The experiment {{was carried out}} in 2001 at the Caiabi farm, near the city of Alta Floresta, state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, as part of a set of tests that have been performed in the same area since 1997. A 200 x 200 m(2) test area was slashed in the beginning of June and burned on 20 August. The area contained 507 logs with diameter at breast height (DBH) higher than 10 cm, per hectare. In the day following the main burn 59 logs were found to remain <b>smoldering,</b> a number that corresponds to 2. 9 % of the total in the area. We chose 11 of the 59 logs to have their <b>smoldering</b> process monitored. Their diameter, moisture content and CHN dry biomass composition after the plot burn and before <b>smoldering</b> were determined. Other parameters such as temperature distribution while <b>smoldering,</b> porosity, density and mass volatilized during thermogravimetric test were also determined. Average <b>smoldering</b> speeds were in the range from 0. 8 to 1. 5 cm h(- 1) for logs that <b>smoldered</b> without transition to the flaming regime. The average speed increased to 2. 1 cm h(- 1) for those logs that oscillated between <b>smoldering</b> and flaming. The speeds were lower overnight as compared to values determined during daytime for the same log. Higher log moisture contents were found to produce decreased speeds. Micro-porous biomass was not observed in the set of the 11 selected logs. <b>Smoldering</b> was observed to occur at substantial intensity in crossing of logs, with no longitudinal propagation.

The pieces mainly feature episodes in the lives of boyars (members of Moldavia's medieval aristocracy), showing {{the ways in which they}} relate to each other, to their servants, and to their country. In one of the stories, titled Cântecul de dragoste ("The Love Song"), Sadoveanu touches on the issue of slavery, depicting the death of a Rom slave who is killed by his jealous master, while in Răzbunarea lui Nour ("Nour's Revenge"), a boyar refuses to make his peace with God until his son's death is avenged. Other fragments deal solely with the isolated existence of villagers: for example, in Într-un sat odată ("Once, in a Village"), a mysterious man dies in a Moldavian hamlet, and the locals, unable to discover his identity, sell his horse. The prose piece Năluca ("The Apparition") centers on the conjugal conflict between two old people, both of whom attempt to hide the shame of their past.
