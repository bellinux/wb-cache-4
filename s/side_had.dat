5|$|In 1912 {{he built}} two pulpits {{for the church}} of Santa Maria in Blanes: the pulpit on the Gospel <b>side</b> <b>had</b> a {{hexagonal}} base, decorated with the dove of the Holy Spirit and the names in Latin of the four evangelists and the seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit; the pulpit of the Epistle <b>side</b> <b>had</b> {{the names of the}} apostles who wrote epistles (Saint Peter, Saint Paul, Saint John the Evangelist, Saint Judas Thadeus and Saint James the Great), with the three theological virtues and the flames of Pentecost. These pulpits were burned in July 1936.|$|E
5|$|The SS {{transfer}} the Jews {{to one of}} two ghettos, each with its own council or Judenrat. Eliezer's house on a corner of Serpent Street was in the larger ghetto in the town centre, so his family was able to stay at home, though the windows on the non-ghetto <b>side</b> <b>had</b> to be boarded up.|$|E
5|$|A new club named Andover Lions F.C. {{was formed}} two weeks later. After gaining {{clearance}} from the Football Association and the Hampshire F.A., the club were {{accepted into the}} Hampshire League 2004 (where the original club's reserve <b>side</b> <b>had</b> been playing) {{in time for the}} start of the 2011–12 season, with home games played at the Charlton Sports Centre.|$|E

5|$|Alcibiades first rose to {{prominence}} {{when he began}} advocating aggressive Athenian action after {{the signing of the}} Peace of Nicias. That treaty, an uneasy truce between Sparta and Athens signed midway through the Peloponnesian War, came at the end of seven years of fighting during which neither <b>side</b> <b>had</b> gained a decisive advantage. Historians Arnold W. Gomme and Raphael Sealey believe, and Thucydides reports, that Alcibiades was offended that the Spartans had negotiated that treaty through Nicias and Laches, overlooking him on account of his youth.|$|E
5|$|Chapman was {{promoted}} to full secretary-manager, replacing Langley, the following month, and soon made an impact, signing players such as England international Clem Stephenson from Aston Villa (who became captain under Chapman) and 18-year-old unknown George Brown (who {{went on to become}} Huddersfield's all-time top scorer). In Chapman's first full season in charge (1921–22), Huddersfield Town won the FA Cup, beating Preston North End 1–0 in the final at Stamford Bridge, the club's first major trophy. In the league, however, his <b>side</b> <b>had</b> spent most of the season fighting relegation and had finished 14th, so Chapman looked to strengthen his squad.|$|E
5|$|The congregation's {{building}} at 60-64 Norfolk Street, between Grand Street and Broome Street on the Lower East <b>Side,</b> <b>had</b> originally been the Norfolk Street Baptist Church. Founded in 1841 when the Stanton Street Baptist Church congregation split, the members had first worshiped in an existing church {{building at}} Norfolk and Broome. In 1848 they officially incorporated and began {{construction of a}} new building, which was dedicated in January 1850.|$|E

5|$|The first {{official}} game {{played by a}} San Marino team was a 4–0 defeat in a European Championships qualifier by Switzerland in 1990. Previously, a San Marino <b>side</b> <b>had</b> lost 1–0 to a Canadian Olympic team in 1986, {{but this was not}} an official match. Since making their competitive bow, San Marino have competed in qualifying for every European Championships and World Cup, but have never won a match in either competition.

5|$|The {{following}} season, Ramsey led {{his side}} to become champions of England in their debut {{season at the}} top level. The <b>side</b> <b>had</b> been tipped by many contemporary football pundits and journalists for relegation {{at the start of}} the season, making the achievement all the more remarkable. Ramsey created a strong side based on a resolute defence and two strikers, Ray Crawford and Ted Phillips who between them scored over sixty goals. The key to the side was considered to be left-winger, Jimmy Leadbetter whom Ramsey moved into a deep-lying, left of centre midfielder.|$|E
5|$|Tyrone had contested {{the final}} in 1986 and 1995 but lost on both occasions, against Kerry and Dublin respectively.

5|$|A small neutral bloc arose {{with the}} Non-Aligned Movement; it sought good {{relations}} with both sides. The two superpowers never engaged directly in full-scale armed combat, but they were heavily armed {{in preparation for a}} possible all-out nuclear world war. Each <b>side</b> <b>had</b> a nuclear strategy that discouraged an attack by the other side, on the basis that such an attack would lead to the total destruction of the attacker—the doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD). Aside from the development of the two sides' nuclear arsenals, and their deployment of conventional military forces, the struggle for dominance was expressed via proxy wars around the globe, psychological warfare, massive propaganda campaigns and espionage, rivalry at sports events, and technological competitions such as the Space Race.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the bridge}} {{remained}} in service for another 21 {{years as a}} free crossing, the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission constructed a brand new bridge at the Portland-Columbia. The new toll bridge was constructed in 1953 for $4 million (1953 USD, equal to $ today), but the toll was only one quarter (equal to $ today), like the former price of the Darlington's Bridge. Darlington, who had retired from his job in Orange in 1950, was alive and was in disbelief. The next April, the Toll Bridge Commission went ahead and dismantled the bridge made useful by Darlington, which was fought by several legal actions. The bridge ceased operations on April 3, 1954, being demolished soon after. The covered bridge at Columbia was destroyed during Hurricane Diane the next August. Just before the demolishing of the Darlington's Bridge, the approach on the New Jersey <b>side</b> <b>had</b> been renumbered to State Highway Route 163, which remains in condition from when the bridge was in use.|$|E
5|$|Aston Villa Football Club {{were formed}} in March 1874, {{by members of}} the Villa Cross Wesleyan Chapel in Handsworth which is now part of Birmingham. The four founders of Aston Villa were Jack Hughes, Frederick Matthews, Walter Price and William Scattergood. Aston Villa's first match was against the local Aston Brook St Mary's Rugby team. As a {{condition}} of the match, the Villa <b>side</b> <b>had</b> to agree to play the first half under Rugby rules and the second half under Association rules. After moving to the Wellington Road ground in 1876, Villa soon established themselves {{as one of the best}} teams in the Midlands, winning their first honour, the Birmingham Senior Cup in 1880, under the captaincy of Scotsman George Ramsay.|$|E

50|$|Dunsany's Chess, {{also known}} as Dunsany's Game, is an {{asymmetric}} chess variant in which one <b>side</b> <b>has</b> standard chess pieces, and the other <b>side</b> <b>has</b> 32 pawns. This game was invented by Lord Dunsany in 1942. A similar game is called Horde Chess.|$|R
50|$|The game pieces (men) {{are always}} {{placed on the}} points, using either marbles or pegs in holes, or {{flat-bottom}} pieces. In two-player games, each <b>side</b> <b>has</b> 20 men; in four-player games, each <b>side</b> <b>has</b> 10 men. The sets of men are distinctively coloured.|$|R
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1927 season, Yorkshire secretary Frederick Toone approached Wilfred Rhodes to suggest that he should resign from his position as senior professional. Rhodes declined, prompted by his wife's suspicion of a plot against him. This may have been an attempt by Yorkshire to clear the way for a new captain. Lord Hawke was in favour of appointing Herbert Sutcliffe, a professional who had opened the batting for Yorkshire since 1919. In addition to Rhodes, other professionals on the <b>side</b> <b>had</b> debuted for Yorkshire earlier than Sutcliffe. However, Sutcliffe was unusual among professionals: he had received a commission in the British Army in the First World War, his appearance was always immaculate and when speaking he altered his accent to fit what he considered a better class of society. Such characteristics were more common among amateur cricketers, and Sutcliffe in many ways behaved like one. While not particularly popular with his teammates, he was respected.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the title}} win, Chapman kept faith with his squad, making only one new signing – outside right Joey Williams – as they {{successfully}} defended their League title in 1924–25. Huddersfield started brightly but a poor run of form in October and November (in part {{caused by an}} injury to goalkeeper Ted Taylor) saw them drop to ninth at one point. Taylor was replaced by new signing Billy Mercer and a resurgence in form saw Huddersfield climb the table, regaining top spot with a 5–0 win over Arsenal in February, and eventually finishing two points clear of runners-up West Bromwich Albion. As a testament to Chapman's philosophy of relying on a strong defence, {{it was the first}} time a title-winning <b>side</b> <b>had</b> gone through a season without conceding more than two goals in any match.|$|E
5|$|For {{the return}} match between NSW and the British Isles on 25 June, each side made four changes. In the opening period, the sides were evenly matched but {{eventually}} the British scored a try in the corner, which was converted, and a second try soon after took them eight points clear. The visitors were up 13–0 at half time after another converted try: the home <b>side</b> <b>had</b> made numerous attacking attempts but had failed to cross the line. The second half started as the first had ended, with NSW dominating, but they failed to score; instead, the British managed to counter-attack to score another converted try. NSW then managed to score a try but Verge failed to convert. The tourists then scored another three tries, one of them converted. With Britain leading 3–29 in the closing minutes, NSW scored a second try; this time Wickham missed the conversion. The final score was 6–29.|$|E

5|$|In Gannon's first match {{back at the}} club, {{the team}} lost a match 2–1 to joint-leaders Fleetwood Town, who {{achieved}} a record attendance in the fixture at Highbury. Gannon managed Stockport to their first back-to-back wins in over three years, since his last stint as manager, with successive 1–0 victories over Wrexham and Darlington. Gannon steered Stockport away from the drop zone, winning eight of the last 15 league games – when the <b>side</b> <b>had</b> only managed to win nine games throughout {{the whole of the}} 2010–11 campaign – to finish 16th in the final table. Gannon again focused on youth development, inducing young players such as Danny Whitehead, Cameron Darkwah, Danny Hattersley and Ian Ormson into the starting eleven. County regained sole tenancy of their Edgeley Park stadium {{for the first time in}} nine years from the beginning of the 2012–13 season, after Sale Sharks relocated for a second time, this time sharing with Salford City Reds at Barton.|$|E
5|$|In {{its defense}} of {{that part of}} Sobuk-san south of Battle Mountain and P'ilbong, the 1st Battalion, 5th Regimental Combat Team, also had nearly {{continuous}} action {{in the last week}} of the month. During this time, Master Sergeant Melvin O. Handrich of C Company, 5th Regimental Combat Team posthumously won the Medal of Honor for actions on August 25 and 26. From a forward position he directed artillery fire on an attacking North Korean force and at one point personally kept part of the company from abandoning its positions. Although wounded, Handrich returned to his forward position, to continue directing artillery fire, and engaged North Korean troops alone until he was killed. When the 5th Regimental Combat Team regained the area, it counted over 70 dead North Koreans in the vicinity, all likely killed by Handrich. By the end of August, the fighting in the mountains west of Masan remained a stalemate. Neither <b>side</b> <b>had</b> secured a definite advantage.|$|E
5|$|In the {{engagement}} on 4 August 1800 neither <b>side</b> <b>had</b> {{a single man}} killed or wounded; the action still inflicted a severe naval defeat on a powerful French frigate force, ending its successful raiding career.

On 9 August he encountered the merchantman Wellesley, which {{was on her way}} to the Cape, but after an engagement of about an hour, the British ship succeeded in driving off her attacker. Jurien followed Wellesley for two days but then gave up the chase; he then did not see another sail until he left the area.|$|E
