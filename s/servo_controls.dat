50|$|Sailboats use {{the power}} of the wind acting on sails to propel the boat. Model sailboats are {{typically}} controlled via a multi-channel radio transmitter {{in the hands of the}} operator with a corresponding receiver in the boat. By changing the position of the two joysticks on the transmitter signals are sent over two separate channels on a single radio frequency (assigned to the individual boat/operator).

Signals from the radio transmitter are interpreted by the radio receiver and translated into instructions to change the position of the servos.
