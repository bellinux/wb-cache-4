This was period when Pakistan Army launched military operation against the vigilantes of Lal Masjid in Islamabad that followed with a rising trend of terrorist attacks throughout Pakistan, mostly emanating from the rugged lands of Waziristan and the surrounding tribal regions. A counter-terrorist operation was then launched under the general which included 2007 Taliban Waziristan offensive, Battle of Mir Ali, and Battle of Swat.|$|E
5000|$|He {{received}} no reward. According to Petrov, {{this was because}} the incident and other bugs found in the missile detection system embarrassed his superiors and the influential scientists who were responsible for it, so {{that if he had}} been officially rewarded, {{they would have had to}} be punished. He was reassigned to a less <b>sensitive</b> <b>post,</b> took early retirement (although he emphasizes that he was not [...] "forced out" [...] of the army, as it is sometimes claimed by Western sources), and suffered a nervous breakdown.|$|E

50|$|Placidianus {{is first}} {{encountered}} as Prefect of the Roman Watch - see Vigiles - under Claudius II in 269. As Claudius {{had been so}} closely associated with Gallienus {{it is likely that}} Placidianus too had been a rising star in that Emperor’s entourage. He must, therefore, have been born with or had acquired equestrian status as Gallienus began the policy of excluding senators from high commands. Claudius apparently valued him sufficiently to use him in a very <b>sensitive</b> <b>posting.</b>|$|R

50|$|Its {{no wonder}} that after {{departure}} of Bishnuram from the political scenario of Assam, rampant illegal influx from Bangladesh took place on political patronage for which Bishnuram was a stumbling block. It took considerable time for the successor of Bishnuram, Late B P Chaliha, to appreciate the influx problem and take some steps during his third stint as Chief Minister. After his return from Madras, Bishnuram again became member of Legislative Assembly, yet he was not considered by his party for any <b>sensitive</b> <b>post.</b> Perhaps his love for his state and no nonsense approach became a misfit in the changed political equation. From 1958 to 1964, Bishnuram served as the Governor of Madras.|$|E
5000|$|... 1949 was {{the year}} in which three post war {{occupation}} zones were relaunched as a new state, the German Federal Republic (West Germany). A few months later, in October, the Soviet occupation zone was relaunched as a separate Soviet sponsored state, the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). In West Germany the first general election took place in August 1949. At Lauenburg, a short distance upriver from Hamburg, Ludwig Geißel campaigned on behalf of the moderate-right CDU (party), of which he had become a member. [...] As a result of his involvement in politics he came to know Herbert Wehner, a former Communist from Dresden and now a somewhat idiosyncratic SPD (moderate-left) politician representing a Hamburg electoral district, who in 1966 would serve as Minister of Intra-German Relations, politically an unusually <b>sensitive</b> <b>post.</b>|$|E
50|$|Corbet {{was elected}} Member (MP) for Shropshire in the Parliament of England summoned on 3 September 1555 - {{the fourth and}} {{penultimate}} of Mary's reign. He was returned, first in order of precedence, with Sir Henry Stafford, a nonentity who had failed twice to secure election in Staffordshire, where his family had great influence. While Stafford's incumbency passed without notice in the parliamentary record, Corbet was noted as one who voted against an important government bill, alongside his uncle Reginald Corbet. This was particularly notable as Sir Andrew had just been chosen as Sheriff, a politically <b>sensitive</b> <b>post,</b> in his native county. In fact he was also Shropshire's commissioner for the loan of 1558, levied to pay for England's disastrous participation in the Italian War of 1551-59, {{which led to the}} loss of the Pale of Calais.|$|E
50|$|In 1946, faint rumours {{which had}} been {{circulating}} within the party about disloyalty {{on the part of}} Lai Teck began to receive more substantiation. This was exacerbated by the restlessness of the rank and file, especially the younger members, who favoured radical action. Lai Teck was removed from some <b>sensitive</b> <b>posts,</b> and an investigation was begun into his activities. A full meeting of the Central Executive Committee was scheduled for 6 March 1947 at which the complaints against Lai Teck were to be aired in his presence. Lai Teck did not attend but instead absconded with the bulk of the Party's funds, hiding first in Singapore, then going to Hong Kong and later Thailand.|$|R
5000|$|Blogging {{websites}} such as Sina Weibo {{are also}} highly censored by the Chinese government. Reuters reported in September 2013 that about 150 graduates, all male, were employed to censor Sina Weibo day and night, and automatic censors processed around three million posts per day. A research team from Rice University, Texas, stated that they saw [...] "a fairly sophisticated system, where human power is amplified by computer automation, capable of removing <b>sensitive</b> <b>posts</b> within minutes." [...] Images censored from Sina Weibo include a portrait of Mao Zedong wearing a pollution mask, a photo compilation identifying the expensive watches on the wrists of supposedly low-waged local officials, and criticism on police action, censorship in education, and the one child policy.|$|R
50|$|Diplomatic Couriers protect {{information}} by ensuring the secure movement of classified U.S. Government material across international borders to over 180 Foreign Service missions. Diplomatic pouches can contain thousands {{of pounds of}} equipment and construction materials, as well as classified documents bound for <b>sensitive</b> <b>posts.</b> Additionally, Diplomatic courier control officers escort sensitive, but unclassified, crated materials within the United States and across international boundaries. These materials receive the same secure shipment as diplomatic pouches but, unlike diplomatic pouches, are declared to customs on entry into a country. The Diplomatic Courier Service securely delivered over 9.5 million pounds of classified material and 1 million pounds of controlled material last year. The Diplomatic Courier Service is constantly evolving to meet the increasingly restrictive guidelines imposed by various countries.|$|R
5000|$|On January 29, 2009, the New York Times {{reported}} that President Barack Obama had chosen Eikenberry {{to be the}} next U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan, replacing William Braucher Wood. The choice of a career army officer for the <b>sensitive</b> <b>post</b> was described by The Times as [...] "highly unusual". On April 3, 2009, the Senate confirmed Eikenberry's nomination, and on April 29, 2009, he was sworn in as the U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan. The official announcement of his nomination was made on March 11. Following his confirmation as ambassador, he retired from the U.S. military with the rank of Lieutenant General on April 28, 2009. As the U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan, he led the civilian surge directed by President Obama, overseeing the growth of the embassy staff from 350 to 1400 civilian personnel from eighteen United States Government departments and agencies, and the administration of bilateral development assistance budget of over $4 billion USD annually.|$|E
5000|$|Napier's {{handling}} of affairs as Acting Ambassador in Naples impressed the then Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Palmerston. He was posted to the British embassy at St Petersburg {{where he became}} a close confidante of Tsar Alexander II. After serving short, satisfactory terms at the British embassies at St Petersburg and Constantinople, Napier was appointed Envoy Extraordinaire and Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States and served from 1857 to 1859. Napier's tenure in Washington was soon mired in controversy. The abolitionist Charles Sumner and elements of the Northern press accused the British minister of being a pro-slavery partisan. More damaging still {{in the eyes of}} the British government was the claim that he had taken upon himself to declare in conversations that Britain recognized the Monroe Doctrine, when all the British governments till then had repudiated it. Critics at the Foreign Office accused him of [...] "giving up everything the United States can wish for, even before they ask it", which for them explained Napier's immense popularity with Washington's influential residents. He was recalled and given the less <b>sensitive</b> <b>post</b> of Minister to the Netherlands. Napier served there from 1859 to 1861 and in Prussia from 1864 to 1866. He was then appointed Governor of Madras in 1866 and served from 27 March 1866 to 19 February 1872.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{the recent}} years, {{advancement}} {{in the field}} of communication technology has made computer networks an essential part of our lives. The result is Security attacks through network have grown in recent years. Since machines on a network provide many requisite services and store sensitive information, therefore theses are a prime target of malicious hackers. The term for such activities d o n e b y hackers is known as intrusions. A ny attempt to compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of a resource is termed as an intrusion. This research paper directly provides the design of a contextually <b>sensitive</b> <b>post</b> processor for Intrusion Detection Systems with knowledge. It relies on information about constituent hosts to generate a composite score for each received alert. The composite score reflects the impact that the attack will likely have on the system and is made up of two different metrics – the susceptibility of the system to attack and the destructive capabilities of the attack...|$|E

30|$|The {{leadership}} {{rotation system}} {{is limited to}} the alternation and rotation of roles 4 between leaders in SOEs. Building a system whereby important and <b>sensitive</b> <b>posts</b> taken by enterprise leaders and cadres are regularly rotated not only train cadres and increases their abilities but can also prevent the power of enterprise cadres from being centralized and thus breeding corruption, i.e., private possession of state-owned assets. The rotation and alternation of enterprise leaders and cadres also promotes the growth of interfirm networking. For example, say there are two state-owned listed corporations, A and B. A leader of corporation A is transferred to corporation B to take a leadership position but because he/she is familiar with the business of corporation A, the supervision and management division of state assets can still appoint him/her as a regular director for corporation A.|$|R
5000|$|Gibson {{returned}} as ambassador to Belgium in 1937. In 1938 {{he was offered}} the post of ambassador to Germany, but he noted, as he had in 1924, that he lacked the personal fortune {{that would have allowed}} him to maintain a post of that magnitude, and preferred to resign. In his 1924 testimony before the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, he had compared his own situation to that of an admiral, sent on a trip around the world [...] "with instructions to call at various ports, entertain the right people and pay for all expenses, including provisions for his ship, out of his own salary". [...] Throughout his career, he had made every effort to modify this situation which sometimes made it necessary to appoint wealthy men with no diplomatic experience as chiefs of mission in <b>sensitive</b> <b>posts.</b>|$|R
25|$|Alexander {{returned}} to Britain in May 1920 as a major, {{second in command}} of the 1st Battalion, Irish Guards; in May 1922, he was promoted substantive lieutenant-colonel and appointed commanding officer. He commanded the battalion at Constantinople (a <b>sensitive</b> <b>posting</b> in the runup to the Chanak Crisis), then Gibraltar from October 1922, then in London from April 1923 until January 1926, when he was released from that role to attend Staff College, Camberley. Alexander was then in February 1928 promoted to colonel (backdated to 14 May 1926) and was the next month appointed Officer Commanding the Irish Guards Regimental District and 140th (4th London) Infantry Brigade, part of 47th (1/2nd London) Division, in the Territorial Army a post he held until January 1930, when he again {{returned to}} study, attending the Imperial Defence College for one year.

[...] He also asked the Leader of the House of Commons to [...] "investigate the security implications of diaries found in the diplomat's London flat which contained accounts of sexual exploits". The Attorney-General Michael Havers replied, [...] "I am {{in agreement with the}} Director of Public Prosecutions' (Sir Thomas Chalmers Hetherington QC) advice not to prosecute Sir Peter Hayman and the other persons with whom he had carried on an obscene correspondence" [...] adding that, while Hayman had been found to have received pornographic material through the post, it was not of an extreme nature, was non-commercial and in a sealed envelope, so did not warrant prosecution. There was much debate and condemnation in the international press of these events.|$|R

5|$|The plenum {{put forward}} three points {{to solve the}} {{problems}} alleged by Tho; (1) to get party cadres to focus on technical economic and management responsibilities, (2) cadres were to be organized and get specialized training in economic and administrative fields to reequip them with information on how to run an increasingly complex economy, and (3) engineer a shift in the internal balance of power.In a Nhân Dân (The People) editorial, Lê Đức Thọ stressed the need to go beyond political slogans and remonstration to enhance the level of management skills of party cadres in party-level organizations. Lê Đức Thọ wanted to change the party's role in the economy from that of implementer to one of supervisor. The central leadership faced an obstacle; most party cadres had what the party leadership considered an outdated education from 20 to 30 years ago, while the party lacked young cadres. To solve this problem, the central party leadership began talking about the need to introduce personnel planning, a retirement age, rotation of officials and tenure length for cadres and <b>sensitive</b> <b>posts.</b>|$|R
