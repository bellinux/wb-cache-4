40|$|According to the 2 nd Law of Thermodynamics, heat {{tends to}} flow from hot to cold. We’ll call the {{temperature}} difference between {{hot and cold}} a potential.

40|$|A <b>heat</b> <b>engine</b> is {{a machine}} which uses the {{temperature}} {{difference between a}} hot and a cold reservoir to extract work. Here both reservoirs are quantum systems and a <b>heat</b> <b>engine</b> is described by a unitary transformation which decreases the average energy of the bipartite system. On the molecular scale, the ability of implementing such a unitary <b>heat</b> <b>engine</b> is closely connected {{to the ability of}} performing logical operations and classical computing. This is shown by several examples: (1) The most elementary <b>heat</b> <b>engine</b> is a SWAP-gate acting on 1 hot and 1 cold two-level systems with different energy gaps. (2) An optimal unitary <b>heat</b> <b>engine</b> on a pair of 3 -level systems can directly implement OR and NOT gates, as well as copy operations. The ability to implement this <b>heat</b> <b>engine</b> on each pair of 3 -level systems taken from the hot and the cold ensemble therefore allows universal classical computation.
