50|$|Unlike {{companies}} such as Intamin, Vekoma, or Bolliger & Mabillard that concentrate on larger and faster roller coasters, Zamperla focuses on more family-friendly roller coasters {{that can be easily}} mass-produced, taken down, and transported to different locations. They are also a major manufacturer of flat rides with such names as: Balloon Race, Bumper cars, Disk'O, Ferris wheel, Water Flume Ride, Galleon/Swinging Ship, <b>Sky</b> <b>Drop,</b> Discovery, Windshear, Tornado, Energy Storm, Z-Force, Mixer, Rotoshake, Turbo Force, Power Surge, and Mini Jet.|$|E

50|$|The Pleasure Beach now has around thirty large rides with newer ones {{coming to}} the park every other year or so. The {{selection}} is varied; from children's rides and attractions to teenage and adult thrill rides. Some of these {{have been at the}} park for decades and form part of its heritage, the most obvious being the Scenic Railway, but also the Carousel (1954), and the Snails & Fairytails (1966). These are complemented by thrill rides like Evolution and <b>Sky</b> <b>Drop.</b> In 2008 the Pleasure Beach became {{one of only a handful}} of parks in the UK to have a large ferris wheel, called The Yarmouth Wheel. This was a semi-permanent ride, first erected in April 2008 for that season and again in April 2009 for that season.|$|E
5000|$|The fifth roller coaster, Rage, {{opened in}} February 2007. It {{is one of}} the biggest {{investments}} the park has ever made. The ride cost in the region of £3 million and is located on the former Raging River Log Flume site. The <b>Sky</b> <b>Drop</b> and Vortex rides were relocated to new positions in the park to make way. The ride is about 75 ft in height and has a 97 degree drop, a vertical lift hill, a vertical loop, a zero-g roll and tight turns. It was named Rage after a competition in the newspaper Southend Echo to decide a name for the ride. The slogan is [...] "For Superheroes only!" [...] which is said before the first drop of the roller coaster. In 2011 a crow built its nest at the top of the loop, gathering attention from tabloid newspapers.|$|E
5000|$|In Mortal Kombat (2011) and Mortal Kombat X, Quan Chi is a zoning {{character}} that enjoys keeping his enemies at full screen. His ground blast, {{which has been}} nicknamed and universally recognized as a [...] "rune" [...] in the community is his primary offensive ability, striking his foes with magic at certain ranges from Quan himself. The EX version of the rune breaks block in MK9 and is used twice in MKX (which can be delayed). These lead to a combo called the Rune Trap, an unavoidable combo in the corner with high amounts of chip damage. His second special move is his Skull Ball, which is {{for all intents and}} purposes, a normal projectile. He also has a move called trance, a magical spell that stuns his enemy and forces them to slowly walk towards Quan Chi, setting them up for a combo. His final special move is called <b>Sky</b> <b>Drop,</b> a teleport that puts Quan Chi above his opponent, stomping on their head, or landing beside them. In MKX, his three variations are called Summoner, Sorcerer and Warlock. The Summoner variation allows Quan Chi to summon a Netherrealm bat, which has multiple special moves, among them a low dive striking the legs, a fireball spit, a grab and a simple combo extender {{in the form of a}} projectile. The Sorcerer variation allows Quan Chi to create three distinct magical fields. His greenish armor field gives Quan Chi one tick of armor as long as he stays within the field, his purple meter drain field changes all of Quan Chi's special abilities to drain his opponents meter on hit as long as the ability was used inside of the field, and his orange curse field makes his opponent take more chip damage. His Warlock variation allows Quan Chi more combos with portals, giving him bizarre melee moves with full-screen range. Quan Chi's strengths are made apparent in his zoning, which a proficient player can use to never lose pressure. However, his weaknesses are apparent in his long starting frames, making his melee game fairly weak.|$|E

60|$|As {{seen from}} the vicarage dining-room, which took a warm tone {{of light from the}} fire, the weather and scene outside seemed to have stereotyped {{themselves}} in unrelieved shades of gray. The long-armed trees and shrubs of juniper, cedar, and pine varieties, were grayish black; those of the broad-leaved sort, together with the herbage, were grayish-green; the eternal hills and tower behind them were grayish-brown; the <b>sky,</b> <b>dropping</b> behind all, gray of the purest melancholy.|$|R

5000|$|Many of Léon's works {{concern the}} {{aesthetics}} of sound, working with [...] "the space where sound and the visual merge," [...] as she describes it. Her 2012 solo exhibition at Magnan Metz in New York, Listening to Silence, focused {{on the relationship between}} the visual world and musical compositions, in a series of works made by superimposing empty musical scores over photographs of nature, suggesting that the visual patterns found in the world - the arrangement of birds in the <b>sky,</b> <b>drops</b> of rain on a sheet of glass, the result of a game of dice - could be [...] "played" [...] like music.|$|R
50|$|Other attractions {{includes}} a go-kart track, bumper cars, bumper boats, 2 roller coasters called Patriot and Desert Storm, some thrill rides including Magic Carpet, Sea Dragon, Free Fall and <b>Sky</b> Diver <b>drop</b> rides, and a log flume called Splashdown.|$|R

60|$|The letter {{opened a}} future before him which was {{something}} to speculate upon, even though his reason {{told him it was}} uncertain, and he lay there dreamily piling one air-castle on another,--unsubstantial as the great islands of white cloud that sailed through the <b>sky</b> and <b>dropped</b> their shadows in the blue sea.|$|R
60|$|He did {{not forget}} the wife and little child whom he had loved so well; but he mourned no longer, for cheerful daisies grew above their graves, {{and he knew that}} he should meet them in the lovely land where death can never come. So, while he waited for that happy time to come, he made his life a cheery song,--as every one may do, if they will; and went about {{dropping}} kind words and deeds as silently and sweetly as the <b>sky</b> <b>drops</b> sunshine and dew. Every one was his friend, but his favorites were the swallows. Every day he went to see them, carrying grain and crumbs, hearing their chat, sharing their joys and sorrows, and never tiring of their small friendship; for to them, he thought, he owed all the content now his.|$|R
