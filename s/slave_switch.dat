40|$|Local-area network (LAN) for {{computers}} prevents single-point failure from interrupting communication between nodes of network. Includes two complete cables, LAN 1 and LAN 2. Microprocessor-based <b>slave</b> <b>switches</b> link cables to network-node devices as work stations, print servers, and file servers. <b>Slave</b> <b>switches</b> respond to commands from master switch, connecting nodes to two cable networks or disconnecting {{them so they}} are completely isolated. System monitor and control computer (SMC) acts as gateway, allowing nodes on either cable {{to communicate with each}} other and ensuring that LAN 1 and LAN 2 are fully used when functioning properly. Network monitors and controls itself, automatically routes traffic for efficient use of resources, and isolates and corrects its own faults, with potential dramatic reduction in time out of service...|$|R
50|$|In Presidential elections, Somerset is a {{somewhat}} erratically-behaving swing county: for example {{it was one}} of only a handful of counties (all in antebellum <b>slave</b> states) to <b>switch</b> from McCain to Obama in 2012 but it swung strongly to Donald Trump in 2016.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{issues for}} the establishment of multihop ad-hoc networks based on Scatternet formation using bluetooth. We describe a new approach of inter-piconet communication. Differing from existing protocols, the design allows the slave to establish contact with other slaves present in the piconet without passing through the master. All new piconet clock synchronization will depend on only one master leader. This will increase the capacity of <b>slave</b> to <b>switch</b> from one piconet to another every slot, increasing consequently the traffic data transfer. We perform a simulation that provides evidence of improving average throughput...|$|R
30|$|In {{the case}} if either the master or the slave {{receives}} two consecutive frames with CRC errors, the connection event is closed. The same happens if either device misses a radio packet. Once the connection event is closed, both master and <b>slave</b> might <b>switch</b> to low-power mode up {{to the start of}} the next connection event. The parameters of the connection (e.g., the connection event interval – connInterval or the list of used data channels) might be updated dynamically. The connection is closed either by the devices once the link is not required any more or automatically due to the connection timeout (ranges from 100 ms to 32 s). All of the above motivates our Assumption 5 on the connection closing interval.|$|R

Seeing a former slave in their commander's position, they cried [...] "Io Saturnalia!"

5000|$|Following the 2.7 Ga rifting or {{accretion}} event, the Slave underwent {{large scale}} extension at 2680 Ma {{resulting in the}} formation of the > 400x800 km Burwash Basin, widespread mafic sills, and other younger turbidites along the northwestern margin. The Burwash basin consists of turbidites interbedded with felsic to indermediate volcanic tuff. At 2634 Ma the <b>Slave</b> <b>switched</b> to a compressional regime and the Burwash Basin started to close, possibly due to shallow subduction from the NW or SE. By 2.6 Ga the Slave had collided with the much larger Sclavia, resulting in shortening and cross-folding over the craton. The presence of three rifted margins around the Slave, as well as similarly aged 3.3-3.5 Ga basement rocks, fuchsitic quartzite, and 2.9 Ga tonalites, suggest that the Dharwar, Zimbabwe, and Wyoming cratons were also part of Sclavia. The Slave broke off of Sclavia between 2.2 and 2.0 Ga, as noted by a host of dyke swarms at its margins. The Slave craton drifted for approximately 200 million years before its accretion with the Rae craton around 2.0 to 1.8 Ga in the Taltson-Thelon orogeny. The orogenic belt accreted smaller exotic terranes before the Slave was eventually subducted eastward under the Rae, resulting in a continental magmatic arc known as the Taltson magmatic zone. Continual eastward movement of the Slave province, along with collision of the Hottah terrane on the western margin of the Slave, lead to intense deformation of the Taltson magmatic zone. The Hottah terrane accreted with the Slave during the Wopmay orogeny at 1.88 Ga, shortly after the Thelon orogeny. This event produced another continental magmatic arc on the Slave's western margin, the Great Bear magmatic zone, as well as the Wopmay fault zone. [...] The Wopmay fault zone consists of thin skinned thrust belts that mark the suture between the Hottah terrane and Slave Craton. These two orogenies have emplaced the Slave craton within Laurentia, where it is still found today.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} BlueRelay, a novel protocol {{that extends}} the Bluetooth specification to support multi-hop wireless communication. Bluetooth is a wireless communication protocol originally designed for point-to-point communication within a small network called a piconet, where a master has centralized coordination over slave devices. The purpose of BlueRelay is to enable inter-piconet communication using existing Bluetooth mechanisms without any {{modifications to the}} Bluetooth link layer and its medium access control protocol. BlueRelay is a two-part protocol. First, the relay establishment process details how a slave device establishes communications with two master devices and acts as a forwarding node between two piconets. Second, the piconet switching scheme employs a Bluetooth mechanism called the HOLD mode to enable a <b>slave</b> to <b>switch</b> {{back and forth between}} two piconets. These two techniques allow Bluetooth devices to forward packets over multiple hops and beyond the communication range of the source's transmitter. BlueRelay is simulated in a Bluetooth simulator that was developed by IBM to simulate the Bluetooth protocol stack. By simulating the relay establishment process and th...|$|R
40|$|In United States v. Gooding, the Supreme Court quashed an {{indictment}} against John Gooding {{for engaging in}} international slave trading, {{a violation of the}} Slave Trade Act of 1818. The Slave Trade Act of 1818 modified the penalties for engaging the in <b>slave</b> trading, and <b>switched</b> the burden of proof to the defendant, to disprove the presumption that the defendant had engaged in the slave trade. This article looks at how United States v. Gooding stands as a step backwards toward condoning and legitimizing the international slave trade. This paper also examines the moral relativism expressed in the United States’ social and legal positions on both domestic and international slave trading, while exploring the uniqueness of Baltimore, Maryland’s role in the domestic and international slave trade...|$|R

He helped Simon the chimp (<b>slave</b> name Peanuts) <b>switch</b> places with a chimp in a zoo, so he could be re-united with his girlfriend. It was Jimmy who realised the real reason why Simon wanted to escape whereas The Lone Gunmen were following the idea that the chimps were being trained as assassins. Jimmy often became the heart of the group as he was more inclined to see the good in people, particularly Yves Adele Harlow and senator Jefferson. Contrary to Frohike and Langly, he also showed no disgust or prejudice towards Byers' transgender college roommate.|$|R
40|$|An {{apparatus}} and method is provided to enable precision and fast laser frequency tuning. For instance, a fast tunable slave laser may be dynamically offset-locked to a reference laser line using an optical phase-locked loop. The slave laser is heterodyned against a reference laser line {{to generate a}} beatnote that is subsequently frequency divided. The phase difference between the divided beatnote and a reference signal may be detected to generate an error signal proportional to the phase difference. The error signal is converted into appropriate feedback signals to phase lock the divided beatnote to the reference signal. The slave laser frequency target may be rapidly changed based {{on a combination of}} a dynamically changing frequency of the reference signal, the frequency dividing factor, and an effective polarity of the error signal. Feed-forward signals may be generated to accelerate the <b>slave</b> laser frequency <b>switching</b> through laser tuning ports...|$|R
50|$|In the Upper South in {{the late}} eighteenth century, {{planters}} had less need for <b>slaves</b> as they <b>switched</b> from labor-intensive tobacco cultivation to mixed-crop farming. Slave states such as Virginia made it easier for slaveholders to free their slaves. In the two decades following the American Revolutionary War, numerous slaveholders accomplished manumissions by deed or in wills, so that the percentage of free blacks to the total number of blacks rose from less than one percent to 10 percent in the Upper South. In Virginia, the proportion of free blacks increased from 1% in 1782 to 7% in 1800. Together with several northern states abolishing slavery during this period, the percentage of free blacks nationally increased to 13.5 percent of the total black population. New York and New Jersey adopted gradual abolition laws that kept the free children of slaves as indentured servants into their twenties.|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{analyze the}} {{influence}} of the excited states (ES) on the dynamics of optically injected quantum dot lasers. In our model carriers from the wetting layer are first being captured into the excited state and then relax to the ground state. Our results indicate that the dynamics of optically injected QD lasers are driven by the relaxation time {{in the sense that it}} scales the regions where the laser exhibits distinct behaviors. It also influences the size of the locking region. The capture time has minor effect and influences mainly static characteristics. Bifurcation maps are studied with the main focus on self-pulsations. In particular our results show that the dynamics of self-pulsations is consistent with experimental observations of excitable dynamics. To utilize the self-pulsations we propose and investigate properties and limitation of the system used for all-optical signal processing. In our approach the <b>slave</b> laser is <b>switched</b> by the information signal acting as a master laser between the locking region and the region of self-pulsations. The maximum bit rate of such a system has been estimated to be 0. 5 GHz. This value can be improved to 1 GHz by applying correction to the detection algorithm. The correction reflects the nature of self-pulsations and is calculated from the distribution of the time the system needs to fire a pulse...|$|R
