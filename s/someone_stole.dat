5|$|Soon {{after he}} {{acquired}} the acoustic guitar, Hendrix formed his first band, the Velvetones. Without an electric guitar, {{he could barely}} {{be heard over the}} sound of the group. After about three months, he realized that he needed an electric guitar in order to continue. In mid-1959, his father relented and bought him a white Supro Ozark. Hendrix's first gig was with an unnamed band {{in the basement of a}} synagogue, Seattle's Temple De Hirsch, but after too much showing off, the band fired him between sets. He later joined the Rocking Kings, which played professionally at venues such as the Birdland club. When <b>someone</b> <b>stole</b> his guitar after he left it backstage overnight, Al bought him a red Silvertone Danelectro.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of that year, <b>someone</b> <b>stole</b> a master tape of a rough draft of the album from one of Gaye's {{traveling}} musicians, Frank Blair, taking the master tape to Motown's Hollywood headquarters. Motown remixed the album and released it on January 15, 1981. When Gaye learned of its release, he accused Motown of editing and remixing the album without his consent, allowing the release of an unfinished production (Far Cry), altering the album art of his request and removing the album title's question mark, muting its irony. He also accused the label of rush-releasing the album, comparing his unfinished album to an unfinished Picasso painting. Gaye then vowed not to record any more music for Motown.|$|E
500|$|Two remixes of [...] "Juxtapozed with U" [...] are {{included}} on the DVD version of Rings Around The World. The first, by the Super Furry Animals themselves, is 3 minutes 23 seconds in length and largely follows {{the arrangement of the}} original with lengthy instrumental passages between each verse and chorus. Electronic drums and keyboards play alongside Gruff Rhys's vocals with barely any recognisable instrumentation from the version of the track which appears on Rings Around the World. The second remix by Lesser is 3 minutes 22 seconds long and begins with a short sample of Rhys singing the words [...] "All the people that you hate" [...] before breaking down to finger clicking and clapping. Rhys's vocals enter again, singing the title phrase, before samples of the original's string section and drums enter at 1 minute 11 seconds. The rest of the track continues with Rhys's vocals backed by disjointed drum and string samples, breaking down towards the end to just the lead vocals and a harp. The remix ends with Rhys singing the line [...] "Til <b>someone</b> <b>stole</b> my name" [...] a cappella.|$|E

500|$|There {{were several}} reasons the tournament went so badly for El Salvador. First of all, El Salvador took 20 players to the World Cup, leaving behind Gilberto Quinteros and Miguel González. According to Luis Guevara Mora, goalkeeper {{of the team}} by that time, the Salvadoran Football Federation decided to take members of the Federation, {{as well as the}} friends and family of many members of the Federation, and spent so much money they couldn't afford to bring a full 22-man squad. Some fellow players tried to gather money to pay to bring their {{teammates}} but couldn't get enough. Further heightening controversy, the team took many detours and stops throughout Europe {{under the direction of the}} Federation, taking 3 days to arrive in Spain and were the last team to do so. Once arrived, there was more trouble. Adidas sent four white and three blue uniforms for each player, but mysteriously only three white and one blue arrived. The remaining uniforms were said to have been taken away by the association. They decided to play with the white uniform and keep the blue as a keepsake. Next, <b>someone</b> <b>stole</b> the balls that the team would train with. The day prior to the match against Hungary, the Hungarians had the 25 balls the organization had given them and trained with them while El Salvador had none and was unable to train. To make things even worse, El Salvador had never seen Hungary play. The only knowledge that they had about the team was a lone outdated video that they had bought. On the field there were more problems. Hungary's fourth goal was caused by Francisco Jovel's sudden deafness. Jovel had received a heavy blow on the cheek and almost could not hear. So when Guevara Mora cried off to stop a ball, the defender did not hear him. Mora attempted to pass to Jovel, but Jovel wasn't looking and the ball went past him and went straight in front of the net. The Hungarian player only had to tap it in. After the match, the Salvadoran squad had a tense meeting with the coaching staff and Federation. The coach was dismissed immediately and the following matches against Belgium and Argentina were managed by players Jovel, Huezo and Fagoaga. Although the tournament overall was a big disappointment, there were also several bright spots. Jorge [...] "Mágico" [...] González was considered by the national and international press as the best player. [...] "Mágico" [...] González stayed in Spain after the tournament and played for Cádiz CF and Real Valladolid. Ricardo Guevara Mora, the goalkeeper, was the youngest player to play at the 1982 FIFA World Cup at 20 years old.|$|E

Breaking from his discussions with Amnon, Hani goes to visit his childhood home in Haifa, which has now become the holy site of Elija’s tomb. The day trip stirs up resentment and frustration in Hani, who is forced to remember his bitter, violent departure from the home {{that had been the}} peaceful sanctuary of his youth. Walking beside the stone walls, he remembers how Israeli Haganah soldiers spoke disrespectfully to his mother and abused him before forcing the family to leave their home. “Amnon always talks of trust,” Hani says, “but how can I trust <b>someone</b> who <b>stole</b> my land and who takes {{a little bit more of}} it every day?” ...|$|R
5000|$|However, it {{does not}} take long for Camoorians to realize that Domenico is not, in fact, related to any of the marshals of the city or the Grand Marshall thanks to Ciccio, so the word about him gets out, and he is soon dragged against his will to meet Marshall Federico Cezar, and his violent second-in-command, Miccinio. Federico {{questions}} Domenico about the money, wondering if Domenico killed <b>someone</b> and <b>stole</b> the money, but Domenico is adamant that this money was a gift from his father. Federico and Miccinio mock Domenico about his father, stating that if he were here, he would protect Domenico from them, and start pushing him around, saying [...] "Father does not exist". Frustrated, Domenico yells at his tormentors to kill him and get it over with, and while Federico is considering it, Miccinio tells him {{that it would be better}} to keep Domenico as a [...] "pet" [...] and make him sit on a shelf and make him pay for all of Marshall's women, food and wine instead of robbing him outright. Federico likes the idea, and although Domenico at first refuses to obey the Marshall's commands, Miccinio scares him into doing it. Domenico is forced to participate in Marshall's [...] "game" [...] because Miccinio scares him more than death itself, considering the rumors that he has heard about the man which imply that Miccinio is a sadist and a torturer and delights in killing the enemies of his city.|$|R

5|$|Along {{with those}} trivial messages, gandingans {{were also used}} in more seriously matters when {{signaling}} to others of imminent danger. During martial law, gandingans were used to warn villagers of incoming Marcos’ soldiers. Every time the villagers received the signal, they would disappear leaving the soldiers aloof until the soldiers themselves brought in a translator who told them, the gandingan {{was responsible for the}} scurry. So they arrested the gandingan player. A similar story talks about a brother of a man who <b>stole</b> <b>someone’s</b> carabao. In order to keep his brother from getting arrested, the brother set up a gandingan up in a tree and would clang it every time the police arrived to warn his brother to leave their house. But like Marcos’ soldiers, the police bought a translator and so they were finally able to arrest the theft for stealing and the brother on the gandingan for obstruction of justice.|$|R
5000|$|For the Carbolic Smoke Ball Co., two new barristers (Asquith QC {{had just}} become Home Secretary), Finlay QC and T. Terrell made similar {{submissions}} to the counsel in the Queen's Bench, but also relied on new authorities {{to argue the}} company out of any contract. They again argued that the contract was not like other reward cases, because catching the flu was not something you had control over, and that {{the words in the}} advertisement expressed a vague intention but in no way amounted to a promise. They said the terms were far too vague to make any contract. New arguments were that there was no [...] "consideration" [...] moving from the plaintiff - Mrs Carlill did nothing of value for the company - by getting the flu. They also argued that there was no communication of an intention by Mrs Carlill to accept the offer, and they relied on Brogden v. Metropolitan Ry. Co., where Lord Blackburn had said that to get a contract simply performing a private act is not enough to create obligations on other people. If one was honestly going to take the advertisement seriously, then it would allow <b>someone</b> that <b>stole</b> the Smoke Ball, and used it and got the flu, to get a reward. But that would be absurd because there would be no benefit given to the company. And, using the arguments from the Queen's Bench briefly, even if it was a contract between a purchaser and the company, it would still be void as a wagering (gambling) contract or as an insurance contract without the required form.|$|R

Then Joey and A$ton started talking about their dream of rapping and they instantly connected because they shared the same interests.

40|$|The terms aural {{skills and}} {{analysis}} often conjure {{a range of}} memories and perspectives among music educators and their students. Music educators often address aural skills and analysis in ways that echo their experiences in undergraduate music programs, drawing on strategies designed for the realm of Western classical music. When translated in K- 12 contexts this may {{take the form of}} using Curwen hand signs and having students identify aspects of standard notation in elementary general music classes or conducting Roman numeral analysis and iden-tifying chord qualities or intervallic relationships in prep-aration for an Advanced Placement (AP) music theory exam in high school music classes. Focusing solely on aural skills and analysis within para-digms of Western music, however, can limit students’ musical learning and engagement to particular ways of knowing music. To diversify and broaden the types of aural skills and analysis that students learn and engage with, music educators might consider contexts beyond Western classical music. This includes having students reflect on their experiences, asking questions, and highlighting aspects of their engagement to make what they are learn-ing, explicit. In this article, I outline several ways that music teachers might situate aural skills and analysis in the context of musical engagement related to popular music and culture. While the specific examples are designed with middle school or high school students in mind, the approaches can be applied in any music learning context if adjusted for developmental appropriateness. Along with broadening the types of aural skills and analysis we include in music programs, the forms of engagement addressed throughout this article might expand popular music peda-gogies that sometimes focus primarily on performing. 1 Engaging as Musical Detectives or Forensic Musicologists Throughout popular culture we can find instances where people identify similarities between two or more songs and wonder if one might have borrowed heavily or per-haps even copied the original song. In popular discourse people might debate over whether <b>someone</b> indeed <b>stole</b> another musician’s music. Searching the Internet usin...|$|R
50|$|The team {{takes on}} the case of a 16-year-old factory manager who fell ill when her lungs {{suddenly}} filled with fluid while at work. The teenager informs House and the team that she is an emancipated minor living on her own and supporting herself, and has been doing so ever since her parents died. The team begins treatment for suspected heart problems, but Kutner chooses to sympathize with the patient rather than follow House's directions and gives her steroids instead of beta-blockers. She has a psychotic break. An MRI shows that the patient lied about her parents' deaths. She says that she had emancipated herself because her father raped her and mother pretended it didn't happen. She then starts urinating blood then has a seizure, then brain lesions. This leads to a diagnosis of leukemia, which requires a bone marrow transplant.
