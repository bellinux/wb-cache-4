It presents the first part of the research entitled "Brazilian international insertion: FDI attraction policies" developed by the Directory of Sectorial Studies (Diset) and concluded in September 2005. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{differences in}} productivity of foreign affiliates of emerging market multinationals (EMNEs) from the BRICS against their counterparts from developed countries and domestic MNEs. Based {{on a large}} database on foreign affiliates in Europe, results find EMNEs {{at the bottom of}} the productivity ladder, with an average productivity gap of around 30 percentage points compared to more established competitors. The paper also shows that this effect is not homogeneously distributed since it varies in terms of <b>sectorial</b> <b>distribution</b> and technology intensity of activities performed, as well as by geographic destination. Moreover, firms' heterogeneity plays a key role given that productivity differentials are largely accounted for the least productive firms, while those at the top of the distribution tend to reach similar performances than their more established competitors, especially in services...|$|E
40|$|The {{factoring}} {{scheme was}} developed by the competition between the market operators and the need for the most favourable conditions of sale. The seller is constrained to provide loans on a broad scale therefore the seller may have liquidity problems. In cases of this kind, the seller can apply to a factoring company in order to access sources, instead of a bank loan. The factoring service has a price. Decision of the financial managers can largely contribute to choosing the appropriate funding form to retain the continuous liquidity situation of an enterprise. Aim of the article is to present the main tendencies of the factoring turnover in international comparisons, highlighting the characteristics of the financial service by its direction, <b>sectorial</b> <b>distribution</b> and customer size in Hungary. It has been estimated that the factoring financing approaches 10 % of the short-term loan stocks of SMEs required from banks which indicates that the factoring is now far beyond the marginal financial service but it is an essential element of the short-term financing toolkit...|$|E

40|$|Income {{distribution}} {{among social}} classes, a preferred topic by the classical economists, has not often been frequented by later scholars. Some recent studies show a new interest, and a generalized increase in income concentration {{in favor of}} the capitalist class, particularly in Latin America. This study uses a multisectoral dynamic simulation model to analize the effects of poverty reduction strategies on the different social classes. The model describes in detail the size income distribution by sector, and transforms it in a <b>sectorial</b> class <b>distribution</b> of incomes. A strategy includes two instruments: investment policy, and income distribution policy, influencing respectively output structure and personal income distribution. The study shows the effects on the different social classes of strategies aiming to achieve the Millennium objective of halving extreme poverty by 2015. ...|$|R
40|$|We study {{growth in}} an economy {{composed}} of sectors producing specific goods with advantage under fragmented competition. The government allocates public inputs. Sectorial political power defines government objectives and restrictions, and consists of passive resistance (bounding taxation), organized resistance (an effective minimum welfare demand), and socially organized power (pushing <b>Sectorial</b> objectives). Income <b>distribution</b> and growth, mechanisms and incentives for public investment allocation, and political organization incentives, are strikingly different functions of input dependence and political power in open and closed economies. Long-term political economy equilibria and tendencies in political transition due to technical or trade policy changes can be modeled. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn this study, {{types of}} {{renewable}} energy resources and usage level of these types based on countries were investigated. Usage {{of renewable energy}} systems and various countries using these systems {{are discussed in the}} study. Various information are also provided about the problems arise from energy needs of developing countries and preference of renewable energy resources by countries based on these problems. Economic, educational and environmental effects of developed and developing countries are also mentioned based on the types of renewable energy resources used in these countries. In the light of these information, advantages and disadvantages of the existing renewable energy resources for countries are discussed. Embodiment of these mentioned factors in the society is also discussed based on this information. Various business areas arise from the use of renewable energy resources in the countries and <b>sectorial</b> <b>distribution</b> of business areas are explained based on numerical data of the countries. In line with these explanations, steps of the business areas which are constituted through renewable energy resources, employment data provided by these steps and the mechanism of employment as a result of data in a sustainable manner are also explained. In this study, renewable energy resources of developed countries, sustainable employment vision and policy convenient for predicted renewable energy resources are also provided...|$|E
40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the causes of}} the modern negative phenomenon of electronic pseudo publications, the unethical publishers of which offer scientists to get the rapid publication of their research for a fee. However, they do not provide proper reviews of manuscripts, and often publish very unreliable research results or the outright nonsense in the journals. Such practices not only cause irreparable damage to the credibility of a scientist who rashly agreed to publish article in the journal, but also intoxicate academic information environment and undermine trust in science in general. On the ground of publication activity of Ukrainian, scientists in journals that were excluded from the database Scopus, certain conclusions from the dissemination of research results in dubious journals were made. The analysis included articles published in journals during 2001 - 2016. Ukrainian authors published the results of their research in 100 out of 300 excluded sources. <b>Sectorial</b> <b>distribution</b> of documents by Ukrainian authors who were published in the journals excluded from Scopus has showed that most scientific fields of these publications constitute {{a very small percentage of}} the total number of publications by local scientists. The threatening situation of dissemination of Ukrainian authors publications in excluded from Scopus journals is observed only in economics, econometrics, and finance, where such publication constitute 63 %. Also, the questionable journals and publishers represented in Ukrainian information space are reviewed and practical advice for scientists, librarians, and managers on how to detect and identify pseudo-scientific journals are provided...|$|E
40|$|In {{the period}} 1981 - 1992, the {{international}} flow of direct investments witnessed significant changes which affected their magnitude, geographical orientation, <b>sectorial</b> <b>distribution,</b> forms of investment {{and sources of}} financing. This happened {{in such a way}} that traditional distribution among industrialized and developing countries was modified as was the capacity for attraction of the different areas in development. In this sense, the main contrast could be seen in the growing importance of East and South East Asia and the decline of Latin American countries which traditionally have been the largest receivers of direct investments within the group of developing countries. The expansive phase of direct investments begun in 1986 threatened to exclude Latin American countries but the establishment of a new framework for the treatment of the problem of external debt -the Brady Plan-, the change in the context of theinternational economy in 1990 and the stability and economic growth of the countries of the region favoured, without a doubt, the recovery of the capacity for attraction for new flows of direct investments regarding Latin American countries. In this way, Latin America registered once again a growing participation in the international flow of direct investments. The evolution of direct Spanish investment in Latin America followed a path similar to that of wider international flows and, after the intense absorption of the first years of the Eighties, the rest of the decade registered a discreet attraction for investors which only began to change course from 1989 onwards with the reestablishment of the new phase of the economic cycle in the countries of the region...|$|E
40|$|This study, {{according}} to our knowledge is among the few ones dealing with the analysis of state aid impact and {{of the way it}} was used at national level. Firstly, the goal of our study is to analyze the evolution of state aid in Romania, the impact on regional development, on creating jobs and value added. Secondly it is intented to see the contribution of automotive sector which received the highest amount of state aid to the trade balance from the current account between 2008 - 2015. Automotive sector is a key sector for the development of Romanian economy in the last 10 years for the manufacturing and assembly of cars and for companies producing equipment or auto parts. The paper is structured in seven parts which deal with topics like the state aid in the European Union and Romania, state aid schemes and funded sectors in Romania, <b>sectorial</b> and geographical <b>distribution</b> of the state aid, the analysis of the automotive sector for Romania...|$|R
40|$|As {{biotechnology}} {{industries are}} knowledge-intensive, Research and Experimental Development (R and D) are key drivers of growth. Governments and businesses {{have an interest}} in creating an environment that stimulates R and D and the commercialisation thereof. Discourse relating to the best means to support biotechnology R and D is extensive. However, there has to date a paucity of quantitative data describing biotechnology R and D in South Africa. This paper therefore offers a brief quantitative profile of South Africa’s biotechnology R and D. These findings provide key indicators of scale, scope, ownership, <b>sectorial</b> division, geographical <b>distribution</b> and collaborative structure. Bibliometric and patent data are used, as well as data sourced from the National Survey of Research and Experimental Development Inputs. It is found that South Africa’s biotechnology R and D investment is small by international standards, but a leader in the African context. There are moreover certain collaborative networks, geographical clusters, and industry applications that demonstrate a high concentration of R and D, which may indicate a path towards achieving critical mass in these areas. Finally, the 2005 / 6 data used here may be used as baseline data to monitor and evaluate the national 2008 National Biotechnology strategy...|$|R
40|$|The {{knowledge}} base {{of an economy}} {{measured in terms of}} Triple Helix relations can be analyzed in terms of mutual information among geographical, <b>sectorial,</b> and size <b>distributions</b> of firms as dimensions of the probabilistic entropy. The resulting synergy values of a TH system provide static snapshots. In this study, we add the time dimension and analyze the synergy dynamics using the Norwegian innovation system as an example. The synergy among the three dimensions can be mapped as a set of partial time series and spectrally analyzed. The results suggest that the synergy at the level of both the country and its 19 counties shoe non-chaotic oscillatory behavior and resonates in a set of natural frequencies. That is, synergy surges and drops are non-random and can be analyzed and predicted. There is a proportional dependence between the amplitudes of oscillations and synergy values and an inverse proportional dependence between the oscillation frequencies' relative inputs and synergy values. This analysis of the data informs us that one can expect frequency-related synergy-volatility growth in relation to the synergy value and a shift in the synergy volatility towards the long-term fluctuations with the synergy growth.

40|$|As China’s economy becomes larger—naturally, {{the global}} outflow of China’s foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) has also been increasing at a rapid pace. One {{of the most popular}} regions for Chinese investment today is North America. Yet despite China’s great enthusiasm to invest in Canada and the US, Chinese firms have received much antagonism in North America. Often times, Chinese acquisitions are viewed in a negative light, and are even denied on grounds which appear to be erroneous. This study asks an important question: what are the political reasons and conditions behind the acceptance and rejection of recent Chinese FDI in North America? To answer this question, this study analyzed and compared Canada and the US in great detail. By observing the <b>sectorial</b> <b>distribution</b> of Chinese FDI, the institutional constructs, as well as the most controversial cases of Chinese takeovers in both countries, the study has found that hegemonic competition and institutional structure {{plays a major role in}} the evaluation of Chinese FDI. Hegemonic competition creates the perception that Chinese FDI is a threat in the US, while the institutional structure in US allows the negative perceptions of China to influence the FDI evaluation process. Derived from the two major factors, secondary factors such as the policy preference of lawmakers, as well as the type of FDI itself are also important determinants of Chinese FDI in North America. As a result, Chinese FDI is more likely to be denied in America. While in Canada, due to the absence of a Sino-Canadian rivalry, Chinese FDI is perceived with more normalcy. Hence, Chinese FDI is less likely to be denied in Canada...|$|E
40|$|For {{the most}} part {{of the last century}} the role of State owned {{enterprises}} was probably more pronounced, continuous and prolonged in Italy than elsewhere in the West. This was the response to the fact that Italian economic growth had long been penalized by structural frailties such as a narrow internal market, a shortage of capital, financial weakness and a decline of entrepreneurial initiative. Yet, the complexity of forms and organizations assumed by the State direct intervention in the economy (just to limit our analysis to the central level) reached heights of imagination and ingenuity in Italy that were probably unknown abroad: State companies, State monopolies, shareholding companies, State concerns and so on co-existed throughout the twentieth century. This helps to explaining why we do not yet have a precise and thorough measure of the weight of public enterprise on the entire economy, not to say of more specific data concerning their <b>sectorial</b> and/or regional <b>distribution.</b> Thus it has not been so far possible to identify precisely - at a micro level - the real dimension of Italian public enterprise, and hence assess a phenomenon whose actual magnitude remains unknown to us. The aim of our paper is to fill this gap by showing the basic features of the dimension, boundaries, structure, governance and location of Italian SOEs. Italy, State owned enterprise, size and structure, governance, economic history...|$|R
40|$|The Triple Helix {{model of}} university-industry-government {{relations}} {{allows us to}} use mutual information among geographical, <b>sectorial,</b> and size <b>distribution</b> of firms to measure synergy at various geographical scales in a nation. In this paper we decompose the synergy in Triple Helix relations and analyze the decomposition at the county level. We use micro-level data for all Norwegian firms from 2002 to 2014. This provides new and more detailed insight into the factors explaining the previously reported variation in synergy at county level in Norway. Furthermore, we analyze the county and city level distributions of all national as well as USPTO granted patents {{with at least one}} Norwegian inventor. Co-inventor networks for Norwegian USPTO patents are visualized using Google maps. The counties with technology-dominated synergies and strong knowledge institutions have a higher level of international co-inventor networks. Sectorial and geographical networks characterize the oil and gas dominated county, Rogaland. In contrast the knowledge institution dominated county of Sør-Trøndelag has broader networks both with regard to sectors and geography. In the small industry dominated county of Møre og Romsdal with high synergy, the lack of international co-inventor network is striking. This might be interpreted as a sign of industrial lock-in. The use of both firm level and patent data together give a broader and more precise picture of the innovation systems under study. The use of both national and international patent data also broadens the picture of the innovation activity of the nation...|$|R
