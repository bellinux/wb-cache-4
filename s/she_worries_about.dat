500|$|In {{addition}} to offering behind-the-scenes glimpses into Beyoncé's intimate world on tour, the film also features performances of over twenty songs with staging, choreography, lighting and production values. In between performances of [...] "If I Were a Boy", {{which included a}} medley with Alanis Morissette's [...] "You Oughta Know", viewers get glimpses of her childhood from old video footage. The footage transitions from Beyoncé dancing up a storm in her childhood home, to sleepless nights on tour where <b>she</b> <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> her health after nine consecutive days of touring, rehearsing, and recording. Despite her struggles, she sings Destiny's Child songs, [...] "Bootylicious" [...] and [...] "Survivor", and asks for a guest appearance from Kanye West. For [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", Beyoncé's performance is accompanied by YouTube footage of fans mimicking her moves, and a short video clip of US President Barack Obama.|$|E
500|$|Leslie is outraged when Jessica reveals {{her plans}} to {{demolish}} an old gazebo {{in the backyard}} of Turnbill Mansion, {{the site of a}} historic wedding between a Pawnee Native American and white woman, which became a [...] "bloodbath" [...] when knowledge of the wedding became public. Under Leslie's orders, Tom chains Leslie to the front gate to prevent construction crews from entering. However, she mistakenly assumes the gate opens from the middle, allowing the crews to enter right past Leslie and demolish the gazebo. At the end of the day, Ann and Mark (Paul Schneider) arrive to free her, and Leslie finally reveals to Tom the true source of her anxiety—Mark's intentions to marry Ann. Leslie feels emotional confusion over this fact. On the one hand, she wants her friends to be happy. On the other hand, she used to have romantic feelings for Mark, she feels insecure about being single, and <b>she</b> <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> losing her two friends. In response, Tom assures her not to worry, thus empowering Leslie to crash and ruin Jessica's party.|$|E

2500|$|Jud and Louis {{quickly become}} close friends. Since Louis' {{father died when}} he was three, he sees Jud as a {{surrogate}} father. A few weeks after the Creeds move in, Jud puts the friendship on the line when he takes the family on a walk in the woods behind their home. A well-tended path leads to a pet cemetery (misspelled [...] "sematary" [...] on the sign) where the children of the town bury their deceased animals. This provokes a heated argument between Louis and Rachel the next day. Rachel disapproves of discussing death, and <b>she</b> <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> how Ellie may be affected by what she saw at the [...] "sematary". (It is explained later that Rachel was traumatized by the early death of her sister, Zelda, from spinal meningitis—an issue that is brought up several times in flashbacks.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} would do something," [...] urged Almayer, moodily. [...] "You know, that woman is a perfect {{nuisance}} to me. She and her brat! Yelps all day. And the children don't get on together. Yesterday the little devil wanted to fight with my Nina. Scratched her face, too. A perfect savage! Like his honourable papa. Yes, really. <b>She</b> <b>worries</b> <b>about</b> her husband, and whimpers from morning to night. When she isn't weeping she is furious with me. Yesterday she tormented me to tell her when he would be back and cried because he was engaged in such dangerous work. I said something about it being all right--no necessity to {{make a fool of}} herself, when she turned upon me like a wild cat. Called me a brute, selfish, heartless; raved about her beloved Peter risking his life for my benefit, while I did not care. Said I took advantage of his generous good-nature to get him to do dangerous work--my work. That he was worth twenty of the likes of me. That she would tell you--open your eyes as to the kind of man I was, and so on. That's what I've got to put up with for your sake. You really might consider me a little. I haven't robbed anybody," [...] went on Almayer, with an attempt at bitter irony--"or sold my best friend, but still you ought to have some pity on me. It's like living in a hot fever. She is out of her wits. You make my house a refuge for scoundrels and lunatics. It isn't fair. 'Pon my word it isn't! When she is in her tantrums she is ridiculously ugly and screeches so--it sets my teeth on edge. Thank God! my wife got a fit of the sulks and cleared out of the house. Lives in a riverside hut since that affair--you know. But this Willems' wife by herself is almost more than I can bear. And I ask myself why should I? You are exacting and no mistake. This morning I {{thought she was going to}} claw me. Only think! She wanted to go prancing about the settlement. She might have heard something there, so I told her she mustn't. It wasn't safe outside our fences, I said. Thereupon she rushes at me with her ten nails up to my eyes. 'You miserable man,' she yells, 'even this place is not safe, and you've sent him up this awful river where he may lose his head. If he dies before forgiving me, Heaven will punish you for your crime [...] .' My crime! I ask myself sometimes whether I am dreaming! It will make me ill, all this. I've lost my appetite already." ...|$|E

60|$|Olive's eyes lingered {{a little}} on her own; then they turned away, vaguely, blindly, out of the carriage-window, and Verena made the {{reflexion}} that she looked strangely little like {{a person who was}} going to dine at Delmonico's. How terribly <b>she</b> <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> everything, and how tragical was her nature; how anxious, suspicious, exposed to subtle influences! In their long intimacy Verena had come to revere most of her friend's peculiarities; they were a proof of her depth and devotion, and were so bound up with what was noble in her that she was rarely provoked to criticise them separately. But at present, suddenly, Olive's earnestness began to appear as inharmonious with the scheme of the universe {{as if it had been}} a broken saw; and she was positively glad she had not told her about Basil Ransom's appearance in Monadnoc Place. If <b>she</b> <b>worried</b> so <b>about</b> what <b>she</b> knew, how much would <b>she</b> not have <b>worried</b> <b>about</b> the rest!
