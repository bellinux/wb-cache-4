5|$|Between 1973 and 1978, {{together}} with Dutch researcher Stan Tempelaars (1938–2010), Kaegi developed the VOSIM program. VOSIM, {{which stands for}} VOice SIMulator, is a system based on the digital sound synthesis of simple, sinusoidal square waves, allowing the modeling of vowel sounds, vocal fricatives and quasi-instrumental tones. It complemented, and was used in conjunction with, Gottfried Michael Koenig's own computer-generated music programs Project 1 (1964), Project 2 (1966) and SSP (1971). Werner Kaegi <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> VOSIM system in 1986 in a presentation for the scientific journal Interface.|$|E
5|$|By 15 March, Soviet commanders {{introduced}} preliminary {{plans for}} an offensive towards Kharkov, assisted by {{a large number of}} reserves.

The build-up of Soviet forces in the region of Barvenkovo and Vovchansk continued well into the beginning of May. Final details were settled following discussions between Stalin, Stavka and the leadership of the Southwestern Strategic Direction led by Timoshenko throughout March and April, with one of the final Stavka directives issued on 17 April.|$|E

5|$|In {{an article}} in the St. Paul Daily Globe, the {{reporter}} <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> events of Adams' exhibition on April 26, 1888:The great finger billiard exhibition came off last night at the Standard billiard hall to a packed house, and those who saw Yank Adams handle the spheres were more than delighted.... Shot after shot were made in lightning rapidity, spotting the ball, running the whole length of the rail, crossing over, with two cushions and counting, going under hats and in between them, cutting the letter S and making the carom, jump shots, masses and hundreds of others too complicated to put in type. Mr. A.M. Doherty played a game with the exhibitor, and at twenty-eight points left the balls in a scattered position, which were gathered at one shot by Mr. Adams, who made fifty shots in sixty seconds. What seemed his most difficult shot was that of placing fifteen balls in a line, and a piece of chalk on the last ball. The hand ball was then dropped a distance of two feet, described a semi-circle, making a carom on all of the balls and freezing against the last ball. Adams' finger shots discount Schaeffer, Slosson and J. Carter combined.|$|E
5|$|The {{project began}} after it emerged {{that the three}} IRA members shot in Gibraltar {{were found to be}} unarmed and not in {{possession}} of a bomb. The series' editor, Roger Bolton, dispatched journalists to Gibraltar and Spain, where they interviewed several people who witnessed the shootings as well as Spanish police officers who had been involved in surveillance of the IRA team. The journalists also filmed the funerals of the IRA members in Belfast. Satisfied by the journalists' findings, Bolton sought a conclusion to the programme; as the British government refused to comment, Bolton recruited a leading human rights lawyer to give his opinion on the findings. The documentary was broadcast on 28 April 1988 (just under two months after the shootings), despite two attempts by Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe to have the Independent Broadcasting Authority postpone the broadcast. Using the eyewitness statements, the documentary questioned the government's version of events, and suggested that the three IRA members may have been unlawfully killed. Reporter Julian Manyon <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> programme's findings: none of the witnesses interviewed for the programme heard the soldiers challenge the trio before opening fire, but variously believed they had seen the IRA members shot in the back, with their hands up, or after falling to the ground. The final contributor was the lawyer recruited by Bolton, who suggested that a judicial inquiry was necessary to resolve the conflicts.|$|E

25|$|To {{improve the}} {{measured}} signal in Auger electron spectroscopy, the gate voltage is scanned in a linear ramp. An RC circuit serves to derive the second derivative, {{which is then}} amplified and digitized. To reduce the noise, multiple passes are <b>summed</b> <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> first derivative is very large due to the residual capacitive coupling between gate and the anode and may degrade {{the performance of the}} circuit. By applying a negative ramp to the screen this can be compensated. It is also possible to add a small sine to the gate. A high Q RLC circuit is tuned to the second harmonic to detect the second derivative.|$|E
25|$|Public {{universities}} in Germany are {{funded by the}} federal states and do not charge tuition fees. However, all enrolled students do {{have to pay a}} semester fee (Semesterbeitrag). This fee consists of an administrative fee for the university (only in some of the states), a fee for Studentenwerk, which is a statutory student affairs organization, a fee for the university's AStA (Allgemeiner Studentenausschuss, students' government) and Studentenschaft (students' union), at many universities a fee for public transportation, and possibly more fees as decided by the university's students' parliament (e.g., for a cooperation with a local theater granting free entry for students). <b>Summed</b> <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> semester fee usually ranges between €150 and €350.|$|E
25|$|The {{last game}} of the round robin of the NatWest Series was, as expected, won by the Australians. However, it <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> {{improvement}} Bangladesh had made over the tour of England. In the first international, they were rolled over meekly by a no-balling, rusty English side – twice. In the last, Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie put the pressure on early, and {{with the aid of}} Shane Watson had them on the reels with 75 for 5. Yet, Bangladesh recovered to post 250 for 8, and were theoretically in with a chance for most of the game. Yet, they started very, very shakily. Javed Omar was dropped by Matthew Hayden in the third over, only to be out to Jason Gillespie in the next for an eight-ball duck – a disappointing end to a fine series for the Bangladeshi. Brett Lee had both Tushar Imran and Mohammad Ashraful beaten with full deliveries, Bangladesh were 19 for three wickets down – an all too familiar position.|$|E

25|$|Just {{what were}} the {{functions}} of the hakham is not clear. Rapoport's suggestion that he was the arbiter in matters of ritual prohibition and permission is highly improbable. Zecharias Frankel looks upon the hakham as a presiding officer whose duty it was to examine a case in question from all points of view, and, having <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> results, to present the matter for discussion. It is more probable, however, that the office of hakham was created in order to secure a majority in cases of difference of opinion between the nasi and the Av Beit Din in the affairs of the Sanhedrin; one of the most eminent scholars was always chosen for the post. A baraita leads to the inference that the hakham was always the director of a school ("bet ha-midrash"), for in addition to the Great Sanhedrin, which later came {{to take the place of}} an academy, there were also private academies under the direction of eminent scholars. The origin of the office of hakham is as doubtful as its duration.|$|E
25|$|McDonald's career {{led him to}} {{the highest}} levels of the United States Navy's command structure. He {{attended}} the National Defense University's National War College, graduating with the class of 1969. From 1970 to 1971, he commanded the USS Coral Sea. In 1972, as a rear admiral, McDonald was assigned as the carrier group commander. He later served as deputy chief of Naval Personnel in Washington, D.C. in 1975. In 1978, as Commander, U.S. Second Fleet, he embarked on the USS Arthur W. Radford on the way to NATO exercises in the North Atlantic. In 1982, McDonald was appointed Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT), one of two supreme commanders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. At the same time, he assumed command of the U.S. Atlantic Command (CINCLANT) and U.S. Atlantic Fleet (CINCLANTFLT). In 1983, McDonald, in his role as CINCLANT, was placed in overall command of Operation Urgent Fury—the invasion of Grenada to rescue U.S. nationals. He later <b>summed</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> success of the operation in an address before the House Armed Services Committee.|$|E
25|$|Some cities {{survived the}} Avar and Slav incursions {{and were able}} to {{maintain}} communications with Constantinople via sea and rivers. Chronicles mention a Roman commander of Singidunum in the middle of Heraclius' reign. But also on many Danube tributaries accessible by ship, Roman settlements survived, as for instance modern-day Veliko Tarnovo on the Yantra River, which even has a church built in the 7th century. Heraclius made use of the short time between {{the end of the last}} war against Persia in 628 and the commencement of Arab attacks in 634 to try to re-establish at least some sort of authority over the Balkans. Clear evidence is the construction of the fortress of Nicopolis in 629. Heraclius also allowed the Serbs to settle in the Balkans as foederati against the Avars, and the Croats in Dalmatia and Lower Pannonia; the Croats even pushed the frontier to the Sava in 630. Having to fight off the Arabs in the east, however, he could not finish his project. Roman rule in rural areas of the Balkans was limited to the successes attained in short summer campaigns. The cities of the Balkans, traditionally the major centres of Roman civilization, had degenerated from the populous, wealthy and self-sufficient polis of Antiquity to a limited, fortified kastron. They were unable to form a cultural and economic nucleus upon which the Roman state could build. Their population was consequently assimilated by the Slavic settlers. Even so, some cities along the Danube retained their Roman traits until the Proto-Bulgarian invasion of 679, also being under Byzantine rule until this date. The fact that the Proto-Bulgarians used a debased form of Greek as administrative language shows that Roman population and administrative structures existed there even after 679. In Dalmatia, Romance idioms (Dalmatian) persisted into the late 19th century, whereas in Macedonia, the ancestors of modern-day Aromanians survived as transhumant nomads. In central Albania, a small ethnic group, unnoticed over centuries of Roman rule, retained its pre-Roman language and also survived Slavic landfall, the ancestors of modern-day Albanians. <b>Summed</b> <b>up,</b> <b>the</b> decline of Roman power on the Balkans was a slow affair, only taking place due to the lack of Byzantine military presence. Being short on troops in the Balkans, there was no possibility for Byzantium to provide for safe communication between the cities. Byzantium could only locally impose a rule over the Balkan Slavs and only on a short-term basis, not enough to assimilate them. Byzantium, however, used any opportunity given by pauses of activity on the Arab front to subjugate the Slavs and resettle them en masse to Asia Minor. With a delay of two centuries, Thrace and Greece were re-hellenized, while, with the exception of the Albanians and the proto-Romanian Vlachs, the remainder of the Byzantine Balkans were permanently Slavicized.|$|E
