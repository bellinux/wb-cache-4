40|$|Humanitarian {{demining}} {{is a very}} dangerous, {{cost and}} time intensive work, {{where a lot of}} effort is usually wasted in inspecting <b>suspected</b> <b>areas</b> that turn out to be mine-free. The main goals of the project SMART (Space and airborne Mined Area Reduction Tools) is to apply a multisensor approach towards corresponding signature data collection, developing adapted data understanding and data processing tools for improving the efficiency and reliability of level 1 minefield surveys by reducing <b>suspected</b> mined <b>areas.</b> As a result, the time for releasing mine-free areas for civilian use should be shortened. In this paper, multisensor signature data collected at four mine <b>suspected</b> <b>areas</b> in different parts of Croatia are presented, their information content is discussed, and the first results are described. The multisensor system consists of a multifrequency multipolarisation SAR system (DLR Experimental Synthetic Apertur Radar ESAR), an optical scanner (Daedalus) and a camera (RMK) for CIR aerial views. ESAR data were acquired in X-, C-, L- and P- bands, the latter two being fully polarimetric interferometric. This provides independent information, ranging from high spatial resolution (X-band) to very good penetration abilities (P-band), together with possibilities for polarimetric and interferometric analysis. The Daedalus scanner, with 12 channels between visible and long infrared, has a very high spatial resolution. For each of the sensors, the applied processing, geocoding and registration is described. The information content is analysed in sense of the capability and reliability in describing conditions inside <b>suspected</b> mined <b>areas,</b> as a first step towards identifying their mine-free parts, with special emphasis set on polarimetric and interferometric information...|$|R

If the person is infected with scabies, the characteristic zigzag or S pattern of the burrow will appear across the skin; however, interpreting this test may be difficult, as the burrows are scarce and may be obscured by scratch marks.

The system consists of a matrix camera (visible and near infrared range of electromagnetic spectrum, 0. 4 - 1. 1 µm), thermal (thermal range of electromagnetic spectrum, 8 - 14 µm) and a hyperspectral linear scanner. Because of a specific purpose and seeking object on the scene, the flights for collecting the images took place at heights from 130 m to 900 m above the ground. The result of a small relative flight height and large MSPs was a large number of images which cover MSPs. Therefore, the need for merging images in largest parts, for a better perspective in whole MSPs and the interaction of detected object influences on the scene appeared. The mentioned system did not dispose of the module for automatic mosaicking and geocoding, so mosaicking and after that geocoding were done manually. This process made the classification of the scene (better distinguishing of objects on the scene) and fusion of multispectral and multiresolution images after that possible.
