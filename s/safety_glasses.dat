Interactions with tiny quantities of promethium-147 are not hazardous if certain precautions are observed. In general, gloves, footwear covers, <b>safety</b> <b>glasses,</b> and an outer layer of easily removed protective clothing should be used.|$|E

25|$|Glasses, {{also known}} as {{eyeglasses}} or spectacles, are devices consisting of glass or hard plastic lenses mounted in a frame that holds {{them in front of}} a person's eyes, typically using a bridge over the nose and arms which rest over the ears. Glasses are typically used for vision correction, such as with reading glasses and glasses used for nearsightedness. <b>Safety</b> <b>glasses</b> provide eye protection against flying debris for construction workers or lab technicians; these glasses may have protection for the sides of the eyes {{as well as in the}} lenses. Some types of <b>safety</b> <b>glasses</b> are used to protect against visible and near-visible light or radiation. Glasses are worn for eye protection in some sports, such as squash. Glasses wearers may use a strap to prevent the glasses from falling off during movement or sports. Wearers of glasses that are used only part of the time may have the glasses attached to a cord that goes around their neck, to prevent the loss of the glasses.|$|E

25|$|It is {{important}} to examine the types of materials to be used while handling the collection. If collection objects are to be moved, the use of flatbeds, carts, dollies, or pallet lifters may be warranted, with these objects being dubbed structurally sound prior to use. Tote pans or support trays are sometimes used for smaller objects, and liners such as polyethylene foam pads, quilted furniture pads, and acid-free tissue are commonly used as an added layer of protection. When necessary, handlers may also don lab coats, <b>safety</b> <b>glasses,</b> dust masks, or respirators.|$|E
25|$|Potassium {{ferrocyanide}} is used {{to achieve}} a blue color on cast bronze sculptures during the final finishing stage of the sculpture. On its own, it will produce a very dark shade of blue and is often mixed with other chemicals to achieve the desired tint and hue. It is applied using a torch and paint brush while wearing the standard safety equipment used for any patina application: rubber gloves, <b>safety</b> <b>glasses,</b> and a respirator. The actual amount of cyanide in the mixture varies according to the recipes used by each foundry.|$|E

25|$|Hazards {{to health}} and safety also exist from {{post-processing}} activities done to finish parts {{after they have been}} printed. These post-processing activities can include chemical baths, sanding, polishing, or vapor exposure to refine surface finish, as well as general subtractive manufacturing techniques such as drilling, milling, or turning to modify the printed geometry. Any technique that removes material from the printed part has the potential to generate particles that can be inhaled or cause eye injury if proper personal protective equipment is not used, such as respirators or <b>safety</b> <b>glasses.</b> Caustic baths are often used to dissolve support material used by some 3D printers that allows them to print more complex shapes. These baths require personal protective equipment to prevent injury to exposed skin.|$|E

Then, special effects shots of smoke and explosions were layered {{on top of the}} vehicle to give it a more life-like appearance. Bruce Harwood, who portrayed Byers, noted that the action sequences in the episode were a challenge. He explained, [...] "It's pretty difficult on a set when the stuntmen come up to you and go, 'Don't worry, you'll be safe, Nothing to worry about. Okay.

2500|$|<b>Safety</b> <b>glasses</b> {{are worn}} {{to protect the}} eyes in {{different}} situations. [...] They are made with break-proof plastic lenses to protect the eye from flying debris or other matter. Construction workers, factory workers, machinists and lab technicians are often required to wear <b>safety</b> <b>glasses</b> to shield the eyes from flying debris or hazardous splatters such as blood or chemicals. As of 2017, dentists and surgeons in Canada and other countries are required to wear <b>safety</b> <b>glasses</b> to protect against infection from patients' blood or other body fluids. There are also <b>safety</b> <b>glasses</b> for welding, which are styled like wraparound sunglasses, but with much darker lenses, for use in welding where a full sized welding helmet is inconvenient or uncomfortable. These are often called [...] "flash goggles", because they provide protection from welding flash. Nylon frames are usually used for protection eyewear for sports because of their lightweight and flexible properties. Unlike most regular glasses, <b>safety</b> <b>glasses</b> often include protection beside the eyes {{as well as in}} front of the eyes.|$|E

50|$|Chemically {{strengthened}} {{glass is}} a type of glass that has increased strength. When broken it still shatters in long pointed splinters similar to float (annealed) glass. For this reason, it is not considered a <b>safety</b> <b>glass</b> and must be laminated if a <b>safety</b> <b>glass</b> is required. Chemically strengthened glass is typically six to eight times the strength of annealed glass.|$|R

2500|$|Ultrasonic welding machines, {{like most}} {{industrial}} equipment, pose {{the risk of}} some hazards. [...] These include exposure to high heat levels and voltages. This equipment should be operated using the safety guidelines provided by the manufacturer to avoid injury. [...] For instance, operators must never place hands or arms near the welding tip when the machine is activated. [...] Also, operators should be provided with hearing protection and <b>safety</b> <b>glasses.</b> [...] Operators should be informed of government agency regulations for the ultrasonic welding equipment and these regulations should be enforced.|$|E
2500|$|The {{high energy}} beta {{particles}} from [...] penetrate skin and corneas and any [...] ingested, inhaled, or absorbed is readily incorporated into bone and nucleic acids. [...] For these reasons, Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the United States, and similar institutions in other developed countries require personnel working with [...] to wear lab coats, disposable gloves, and <b>safety</b> <b>glasses</b> or goggles {{to protect the}} eyes, and avoid working directly over open containers. [...] Monitoring personal, clothing, and surface contamination is also required. [...] Shielding requires special consideration. [...] The high energy of the beta particles gives rise to secondary emission of X-rays via Bremsstrahlung (braking radiation) in dense shielding materials such as lead. [...] Therefore, the radiation must be shielded with low density materials such as acrylic or other plastic, water, or (when transparency is not required), even wood.|$|E
