50|$|Seif dunes {{are thought}} to develop from barchans if a change of the usual wind {{direction}} occurs. The new wind direction {{will lead to the}} development of a new wing and the over development of one of the original wings. If the prevailing wind then becomes dominant for a lengthy period of time the dune will revert to its barchan form, with one exaggerated wing. Should the strong wind then return the exaggerated wing will further extend so that eventually it will be supplied with sand when the prevailing wind returns. The wing will continue to grow under both wind conditions, thus producing a <b>seif</b> <b>dune.</b> On a <b>seif</b> <b>dune</b> the slipface develops on the side facing away from the strong wind, while the slipface of a barchan faces the direction of movement.

Calculations of dune formation on an inclined surface under constant wind direction also lead to barchan asymmetry, however no <b>seif</b> <b>dune</b> is obtained from surface tilting alone. Asymmetric barchans migrating along a tilted surface move laterally, with transverse migration velocity proportional to the slope of the terrain. Limb elongation induced by topography can occur when a barchan crosses a topographic rise. Furthermore, transient asymmetric barchan shapes with extended limb also emerge during collisions between dunes or due to an asymmetric influx. Our findings can be useful for making quantitative inference on local wind regimes or spatial heterogeneities in transport conditions of planetary dune field...|$|E

40|$|This Sheet Description {{describes}} the geology of the Sweihan and Remah 1 : 100 000 scale geological map. The Sweihan and Remah district covers 2780 km 2 east of Abu Dhabi. Over 700 observation points were made throughout the district. Pre-Quaternary bedrock comprises Miocene conglomerate of the Barzaman Formation which probably underlies the entire area. It is poorly exposed in roughly east-west trending inter-dune areas {{and in a}} number of excavations in the northwest and eastern parts of the area. Over almost the entire area, the Barzaman Formation is overlain by deposits of the Quaternary (Pleistocene) Hili Formation, which is up to at least 20 m thick in places. Three facies of the Hili Formation were mapped; coarse fluvial channel gravels, fluvial sands, and siltstones (overbank deposits). They represent a complex fluvial outwash system draining from the Hajar Mountains in the east. As such, they tend to fine distally to the southwest, where the majority of the fluvial sands and siltstone/mudstones occur. They locally contain intercalated aeolian sand beds which were blown in from the north-west. Quaternary carbonate-cemented aeolianites of the Ghayathi Formation are well-developed in the north western corner of the district. These represent fossil <b>seif</b> <b>dune</b> systems which locally form the cores to fields of modern pale carbonate-dominated low dunes. The Quaternary deposits are overlain by various modern dune sands (Rub al Khali Formation) with various morphologies, mapped as dune ridges, locally culminating in star dunes, and barchanoid low dune fields. Interdune areas, floored either by Miocene or Quaternary rocks typically have continental sabkha veneers and, adjacent to the dune fields, thin sand veneer...|$|E

The area includes part of what was known to medieval Arab geographers as the Ṣayhad. It extends from al-Khawr {{to the edge of}} the Rub' al-Khālī or Empty Quarter.

5|$|The {{shape of}} the dune depends on the {{characteristics}} of the prevailing wind. Barchan dunes are produced by strong winds blowing across a level surface, and are crescent-shaped with the concave side away from the wind. When there are two directions from which winds regularly blow, a series of long, linear <b>dunes</b> known as <b>seif</b> <b>dunes</b> may form. These also occur parallel to a strong wind that blows in one general direction. Transverse dunes run at a right angle to the prevailing wind direction. Star dunes are formed by variable winds, and have several ridges and slip faces radiating from a central point. They tend to grow vertically; they can reach a height of , making them the tallest type of dune. Rounded mounds of sand without a slip face are the rare dome dunes, found on the upwind edges of sand seas.|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} dune {{morphology}} represents {{a valuable tool}} {{in the investigation of}} planetary wind systems—the primary factor controlling the dune shape is the wind directionality. However, our understanding of dune formation is still limited to the simplest situation of unidirectional winds: There is no model that solves the equations of sand transport under the most common situation of seasonally varying wind directions. Here we present the calculation of sand transport under bimodal winds using a dune model that is extended to account for more than one wind direction. Our calculations show that dunes align longitudinally to the resultant wind trend if the angle θw between the wind directions is larger than 90 °. Under high sand availability, linear <b>seif</b> <b>dunes</b> are obtained, the intriguing meandering shape of which is found to be controlled by the dune height {{and by the time the}} wind lasts at each one of the two wind directions. Unusual dune shapes including the “wedge dunes” observed on Mars appear within a wide spectrum of bimodal dune morphologies under low sand availability...|$|R
40|$|The {{very young}} Wabar craters formed by impact of an iron {{meteorite}} and {{are known to}} the scientific community since 1933. We describe field observations made {{during a visit to}} the Wabar impact site, provide analytical data on the material collected, and combine these data with poorly known information discovered during the recovery of the largest meteorites. During our visit in March 2008, only two craters (Philby-B and 11 m) were visible; Philby-A was completely covered by sand. Mapping of the ejecta field showed that the outcrops are strongly changing over time. Combining information from different visitors with our own and satellite images, we estimate that the large <b>seif</b> <b>dunes</b> over the impact site migrate by approximately 1. 0 – 2. 0 m yr − 1 southward. Shock lithification took place even at the smallest, 11 m crater, but planar fractures (PFs) and undecorated planar deformation features (PDFs), as well as coesite and stishovite, have only been found in shock-lithified material from the two larger craters. Shock-lithified dune sand material shows perfectly preserved sedimentary structures including cross-bedding and animal burrows as well as postimpact structures such as open fractures perpendicular to the bedding, slickensides, and radiating striation resembling shatter cones. The composition of all impact melt glasses can be explained as mixtures of aeolian sand and iron meteorite. We observed a partial decoupling of Fe and Ni in the black impact glass, probably due to partitioning of Ni into unoxidized metal droplets.

The creation and destruction of secondary porosity {{is the result of}} changes in porewater chemistry during burial and subsequent uplift. Three pore-fluid regimes can be identi-fied: (1) alkaline, oxidizing conditions during shallow to intermediate burial; (2) acid, reducing conditions during intermediate to deep burial; (3) alkaline, reducing conditions during deep burial and uplift. The transition from stage 1 to stage 2 was probably caused by expulsion of waters from the underlying Carboniferous shales. The transition to stage 3 probably began when faulting associated with uplift allowed invasion by alkaline fluids derived from Zechstein sediments. The Upper Rotliegend sandstones in the Southern Permian Basin of the North Sea form an important gas reservoir ock with proven recoverable reserves of 4. 1 • 1012 m 3 (Glennie, 1984). As a result, their depositional environment and diagenetic history have been intensively investigated. Three major facies have been identified in the Upper Rotliegend: fluvial (wadi), aeolian, and a sabkha-desert lake association (Seemann, 1982). The three facies occur in belts roughly parallel to the Variscan mountain front, but {{in the western part of}} the Basin the aeolian facies is more extensively developed at the expense of the wadi and sabkha facies. Dune sands form the main reservoir ock. Studies of the sedimentary structures have shown that both transverse and <b>seif</b> <b>dunes</b> are represented, with associated inter-dune deposits characterized by the presence of adhesion ripple...|$|R
40|$|The {{transport}} and deposition of sand {{is the most}} prevalent agent of landscape modification on Mars today, with fluxes comparable to some sand dunes on Earth. Until now, the relationship between sand flux and dune field morphology has been poorly constrained. By tracking dune movement over ∼ 10 km-long dune fields in Herschel Crater and Nili Patera, representative of many dune fields on Mars, we find a downwind flux decrease that correlates with a sequence of changing morphology from barchans to barchanoids and <b>seifs</b> (longitudinal <b>dunes)</b> to isolated dome dunes and ending with sand sheets. We show empirical consistency with atmospheric Internal Boundary Layer (IBL) theory which can describe these broad flux and morphology changes in Martian dune fields. Deviations from IBL flux predictions are from wind streamline compressions up slopes, leading to a speedup effect. By establishing a dune field morphology type example and correlating it with measured and predicted flux changes, we provide an integrated morphology and flux model {{that can be applied}} to other areas of Mars and be used to infer paleo-environmental conditions from preserved sandstone...|$|R
40|$|We used a {{hydraulic}} flume to conduct analog model experiments to elucidate {{the effects of}} alternating orientations of bidirectional flows (intersection angle θ) on the morphology and evolution of isolated sand dunes. An initial cone of fine-grained quartz sand was exposed to bidirectional water flows {{with a range of}} intersection angles (45 °, 90 °, 135 °, and 180 °) for 20 cycles of flow alternation, with a cycle duration of 2 min. Experimental trials showed two types of deformation of the crest line: (1) “independence type”, in which a new crest line formed at a different location from the existing one; and (2) “reverse type”, in which an existing crest line reversed its migration direction and a new slip face was generated on the new stoss side of the existing crest. The independence type was observed at θ = 45 ° and the reverse type was observed at θ = 180 °. At intermediate values of θ, the two types occurred contemporaneously. Due to the cumulative effect of deformation of the crest line, three types of topographies developed, with features characteristic of dome, longitudinal (<b>seif),</b> and reversing <b>dunes.</b> These results yield insights into the processes and conditions required for the formation of sand dune types. 移動砕屑物量が少ない場で発達する孤立砂丘地形と流れ環境との関係を調べる水中モデル実験をおこなった．初期の孤立地形に作用させる流れを交互二方向流としたところ，峰線の挙動にふたつの類型があることが分かった．既存の峰線とは異なる位置に新たな峰線が形成される独立型と，既存の峰線に沿って逆方向のスリップフェイスが形成され，峰線の移動方向が逆転する反転型である．両者は二方向流の方位差θに対応し，θ＝ 45 °の場合は独立型のみが，θ＝ 180 °の場合は反転型のみが生じた．θ＝ 90 °とθ＝ 135 °の場合，独立型と反転型とが地形上の異なる部位で同時に進行した．これらの峰線の挙動が長い時間に渡って繰り返されると，その累積的な影響の結果として， 3 種類の地形が発達した．これらの地形は，それぞれ天然のドーム砂丘，縦列（セイフ）砂丘，リバーシング砂丘と共通する形態を持っていた．この成果は，天然の各種孤立砂丘の形成要因解明に寄与するものである...|$|R
40|$|Calcrete {{has been}} shown to contain {{significant}} Au, derived from nearby mineralisation, and this has led to its current use as an exploration sampling medium. Calcretes are secondary carbonates, principally consisting of calcite and dolomite that may precipitate in regolith in a semi-arid climate. They overprint existing regolith material and commonly contain this material (e. g. soil, colluvium, laterite, saprolite and rock) on, and within, which they form. Vadose (pedogenic) and phreatic (formed by groundwater) are the two principal types of calcrete. Pedogenic calcretes are those that form in unsaturated soil horizons and are widely distributed in southern Australia and in all continents of the world. They may dissolve and re-precipitate within soil horizons, giving rise to several generations of carbonates, depending on changing climate conditions. This thesis will be restricted to pedogenic calcretes. Despite the common use of pedogenic calcrete as a sampling medium there is a paucity of published research on how Au anomalies actually form in this material. Thus fundamental research is required to be undertaken {{on the nature of the}} Au-in-calcrete association, which will promote better understanding of how, when and where calcrete sampling is applicable for the exploration industry. In order to investigate the relationship between Au and calcrete several Au prospects from South Australia were selected for field and laboratory study, including Challenger, Barns, and Edoldeh Tank. Additional samples were investigated from the Bounty Deposit (Western Australia) where Au concentrations in calcrete are an order of magnitude higher than the South Australian counterparts. At Challenger, the origin of the calcrete that is associated with Au was investigated. Pre-Cambrian rocks, such as the Archaean at Challenger, have very high 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios compared to rocks that have only recently been formed such as those derived from marine sources. Strontium isotopes were determined at Challenger and demonstrated to be derived from a marine source rather than the bedrock, despite the association of Sr (and, by inference, Ca) with Au. It was concluded that pedogenic processes (e. g. capillarity, bioturbation, evapotranspiration) caused exotic alkaline earth metals to become associated with residual Au. At Challenger, more than 95 % of the Sr (Ca) was derived from marine sources (dust, rainfall and/or aerosol). The relationship between marine-derived calcrete and Au has never been established for auriferous calcrete before and is significant since it suggests that the origin of the alkaline earth metals (Sr and Ca) is not important for its association with Au; Au is clearly originally derived from the regolith underlying the calcrete. Furthermore, a strong correlation with distance from the coast showed that the nearer to the ocean then the greater the contribution of marine Sr (low 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio) occurs. In a companion study, stable C isotopes were examined from the same auriferous calcrete samples and it was demonstrated, for the first time, that both C 3 and C 4 plants (trees and grasses) were equally dominant contributors to the inorganic C in the calcrete. Thus, the calcite in the soil (Ca and carbonate ion) is derived principally from marine and plant sources. At Barns, disseminated Au mineralisation has created a contiguous Au-in-calcrete anomaly developed immediately above and within the saprolite. However, linear (<b>seif)</b> sand <b>dunes</b> have buried the anomaly in places. A biogeochemical survey was undertaken along and across the sand dunes over mineralisation at Barns to examine the role of vegetation in creating the Au-in-calcrete anomaly. A clear biogeochemical anomaly was identified in plant foliage, bark and litter demonstrating that Au was being taken up by roots that were tapping into buried calcrete, or mineralisation beneath it, in some cases, at least 8 m below the surface, and then depositing the Au at the surface on top of the dune. Having demonstrated the uptake of Au by plants, a dune was excavated and powdery calcrete developed in a rhizosphere within the dune was investigated. Significantly, the calcrete was shown to be highly anomalous in Au (five times above background) and thus, for the first time, it was shown that plants have had a key role in the development of a Au-in-calcrete anomaly, and, importantly, in transported regolith. Furthermore, thermoluminescence of quartz grains was commissioned and shown that the emplacement of sand above the calcrete was about 26 000 years old, indicating that the anomaly was younger than this. Mass balance calculations were performed and showed that the Au in the sand dune may have accumulated in less than 10 000 years; calcrete around the root has developed during the life of the tree. Clearly, Au-in-calcrete anomalies can form relatively rapidly compared with the age of sediments themselves. As Au concentrations were generally low (< 20 ppb) at Barns, the nature of the Au-in-calcrete was investigated in samples from Bounty where concentrations reach 1 ppm. Having established a causal relationship between Au-in-calcrete and vegetation at Barns, direct evidence of the role of plants at the micron scale was sought. Samples were chosen 6 from a soil profile that showed a strong positive correlation between Au and Ca and thus a minimal effect of detrital Au. Using LA-ICP-MS, SXRF (synchrotron X-ray fluorescence) and XANES (micro-X-ray absorption near-edge structure), it was shown for the first time that (i) the distribution of Au-in-calcrete at the micron scale was variable and (ii) Au occurs in both particulate and ionic form. Furthermore, ionic Au associated with Br was found in a root tubule. These observations are evidence of an evapotranspiration model for the formation of the strong, down-profile relationship between Au and calcrete i. e. Au has been mobilised then precipitated with the carbonate as vadose water has been removed from the soil by vegetation. Bromine is a typical element (with chloride and sulphate) found in evaporates. There is no chemical affinity between Au and Ca in the soil profile since further detailed analyses on sub-samples using wet chemical, LA-ICP-MS (laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry) and SXRF techniques show that a Au-Ca relationship is not apparent at the sub-millimetre scale. Gold and Ca are behaving similarly but independently and they do not (at the μm scale) form a chemical bond with carbonate minerals. At Edoldeh Tank (ET) Au prospect the distribution of Au on a tenement-scale was investigated. It was shown that geomorphological factors influence the shape and tenor of Au-in-calcrete anomalies. By their very nature Au-in-calcrete anomalies are dispersed over a wide area (to make them an effective sample medium) and this study served to document the factors involved. The ET prospect (Gawler Craton, South Australia) hosts one of the largest Au-in-calcrete anomalies in Australia and is typical of many such prospects identified in the region. For in situ regolith, Au is concentrated in surficial calcrete and above an upper saprolite zone depleted in Au. The Au anomaly extends downslope from a ridge of calcrete and silcrete covered saprolite into adjacent and transported regolith dominated by thin (~ 5 m) aeolian sand cover. The anomaly is locally broadened by downslope hydromorphic dispersion and cemented within laminated calcrete in the transported regolith. The laminated calcrete was examined in detail and the nature of the Au was found to be similar to that found at Bounty i. e. the Au in the calcrete occurs in nano-scale particulate and possibly ionic forms. In field experimental studies indicate that Au and also Ag are actively dispersing in the soil. The Ag content may be a means of distinguishing transported anomalies from those developed in situ and the calcrete is much older (120 000 years) than that found at Barns. The combined individual site studies at Challenger, Barns, ET and samples from Bounty advance our understanding of the formation of Au-in-calcrete anomalies. The work has shown that an association between Au and calcrete can form at the sub-micron (ionic) to profile scale from both abiotic (geomorphology, climate, mineralisation style) and biotic (vegetation) factors; abiotic factors can shape the overall form, tenor and evolution of the Au-in-calcrete anomaly. No direct evidence was found of the role that micro-organisms play in the formation of Au-in-calcrete anomalies although experimental results from elsewhere suggest that this may be plausible, at least, in the laboratory. Further work on the role of bacteria on the formation of Au-in-calcrete anomalies in the natural environment should be encouraged. The size and shape of Au-in-calcrete anomalies may be influenced by mineralisation style, hydrology and topography and while these were briefly investigated further work is needed...|$|R
