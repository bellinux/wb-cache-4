500|$|Solid-propellant rocket: The medieval Song dynasty Chinese {{invented the}} <b>solid-propellant</b> <b>rocket</b> {{at a time}} when bows, arrows, and catapult-based {{projectile}} launchers were state of the art military technology in medieval Europe. Illustrations and descriptions in the 14th century Chinese military treatise [...] Huolongjing by the Ming dynasty military writer and philosopher Jiao Yu confirm that the Chinese in 1232 used proto-solid propellant rockets then known as [...] "fire arrows" [...] to drive back the Mongols during the Siege of Kaifeng. Each arrow took a primitive form of a simple, <b>solid-propellant</b> <b>rocket</b> tube that was filled gunpowder. One open end allowed the gas to escape and was attached to a long stick that acted as a guidance system for flight direction control.|$|E
2500|$|In 1943, Cook {{was asked}} to provide an expert opinion on {{military}} intelligence that the Germans were developing long-range rockets. Cherwell, Crow and Cook were agreed that a long-range liquid-propellant rocket was technologically infeasible, and a <b>solid-propellant</b> <b>rocket</b> using cordite would be impractically large. Wernher von Braun proved them wrong, with the successful deployment of the V-2 rocket. Cook {{then turned to the}} study of missile guidance mechanisms for the British Liquid Oxygen-Petrol / Guided Aerial Projectile [...] (LOP/GAP) liquid-propellant rocket. After the war he became director of the Ministry of Supply's Rocket Propulsion Establishment at Westcott, Buckinghamshire.|$|E
2500|$|The first concerted Mongol {{invasion}} of Jin occurred in 1211 and total conquest was not accomplished until 1234. In 1232 the Mongols besieged the Jin capital of Kaifeng and deployed gunpowder weapons {{along with other}} more conventional siege techniques such as building stockades, watchtowers, trenches, guardhouses, and forcing Chinese captives to haul supplies and fill moats. Jin scholar Liu Qi (劉祈) recounts in his memoir, [...] "the attack against the city walls grew increasingly intense, and bombs rained down as [...] advanced." [...] The Jin defenders also deployed gunpowder bombs as well as fire arrows (huo jian 火箭) launched using a type of early <b>solid-propellant</b> <b>rocket.</b> Of the bombs, Liu Qi writes, [...] "From within the walls the defenders responded with a gunpowder bomb called the heaven-shaking-thunder bomb (震天雷). Whenever the [...] troops encountered one, several men at a time would be turned into ashes." [...] A more fact based and clear description of the bomb exists in the History of Jin: [...] "The heaven-shaking-thunder bomb is an iron vessel filled with gunpowder. When lighted with fire and shot off, it goes off like a crash of thunder that can be heard for a hundred li , burning an expanse of land {{more than half a}} mu , and the fire can even penetrate iron armor." [...] A Ming official named He Mengchuan would encounter an old cache of these bombs three centuries later in the Xi'an area: [...] "When I went on official business to Shaanxi Province, I saw on top of Xi'an's city walls an old stockpile of iron bombs. They were called 'heaven-shaking-thunder' bombs, and they were like an enclosed rice bowl with a hole at the top, just big enough to put your finger in. The troops said they hadn't been used for a very long time." [...] Furthermore, he wrote, [...] "When the powder goes off, the bomb rips open, and the iron pieces fly in all directions. That is how it is able to kill people and horses from far away." ...|$|E

50|$|A ramjet generates no {{static thrust}} and needs a booster {{to achieve a}} forward {{velocity}} high enough for efficient operation of the intake system. The first ramjet-powered missiles used external boosters, usually <b>solid-propellant</b> <b>rockets,</b> either in tandem, where the booster is mounted immediately aft of the ramjet, e.g. Sea Dart, or wraparound where multiple boosters are attached alongside {{the outside of the}} ramjet, e.g. SA-4 Ganef. The choice of booster arrangement is usually driven {{by the size of the}} launch platform. A tandem booster increases the overall length of the system, whereas wraparound boosters increase the overall diameter. Wraparound boosters will usually generate higher drag than a tandem arrangement.|$|R
50|$|An {{attachment}} to the Aberdeen Proving Ground in 1932 gave him the chance to experiment with <b>solid-propellant</b> <b>rockets,</b> the only rocket research in the US Armed Forces at that time. After a spell at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to complete a Master of Science degree, Skinner became an instructor at Aberdeen and continued his experiments in his spare time, often reusing discarded artillery propellants and scrap parts.
