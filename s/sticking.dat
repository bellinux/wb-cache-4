40|$|A {{geometric}} construction {{called the}} star move is introduced. Given the correct setup, the star move {{can be used}} to add 2 <b>sticks</b> and 3 crossings to a <b>stick</b> knot. In particular, the star move may be preformed on an 8 <b>stick</b> 8 crossing <b>stick</b> knot to obtain a 10 <b>stick</b> 11 crossing <b>stick</b> knot. Previously, the smallest knot known to have fewer <b>sticks</b> than crossings was an 11 <b>stick</b> 12 crossing knot [1]. ...|$|R
5|$|To deter pursuits of marching {{infantry}} or riding cavalry, the Han Chinese made caltrops (barbed iron balls {{with sharp}} spikes <b>sticking</b> {{out in all}} directions) that could be scattered {{on the ground and}} pierce the feet or hooves of those who were unaware of them.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{determined}} {{resistance of}} the 99th Division, which was composed of relatively inexperienced troops, along with the experienced 2nd and 30th Divisions, the northern shoulder of the Battle of the Bulge was a <b>sticking</b> point for the entire offensive operation.

5|$|Exotic species (also {{known as}} {{invasive}} or non-native species) are often unintentionally introduced by people traveling {{from outside the}} forest by <b>sticking</b> to vehicle tires, shoes, or cattle and are usually found near roadways, campgrounds, and other areas used by people. The Forest Service has an invasive species control effort that identifies and attempts to contain the further spread of non-native plants. Invasive plants of particular concern in the forest include spotted knapweed, yellow starthistle, rush skeletonweed, leafy spurge, and cheatgrass.|$|E
50|$|The {{manipulation}} of the devil <b>stick</b> (also devil-sticks, devilsticks, flower <b>sticks,</b> gravity <b>sticks,</b> or juggling <b>sticks)</b> {{is a form of}} gyroscopic juggling or equilibristics, consisting of manipulating one <b>stick</b> ("baton") between one or two other <b>sticks</b> held one in each hand. The baton is lifted, struck, or stroked by the two control <b>sticks</b> ('handsticks' or 'sidesticks'), stabilising the baton through gyroscopic motion.|$|R

5|$|Meibomian glands, in the eyelids, secrete {{a form of}} sebum called meibum {{onto the}} eye, that slows the {{evaporation}} of tears. It also serves to create an airtight seal when the eyes are closed and its lipid quality also prevents the eyelids from <b>sticking</b> together. The meibomian glands are also known as tarsal glands, Zeis glands and palpebral glands. They attach directly to the follicles of the eyelashes, which are arranged vertically within the tarsal plates of the eyelids.|$|E

5|$|A {{strategy}} {{for dealing with}} seasonal plenty is to eat {{as much as possible}} and store the surplus nutrients as fat. Marmots do this, and may be 50% heavier in the autumn than in the spring. They rely on their fat reserves during their long winter hibernation. Beavers feed on the leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees, as well as aquatic plants. They store food for winter use by felling small trees and leafy branches in the autumn and immersing them in their pond, <b>sticking</b> the ends into the mud to anchor them. Here, they can access their food supply underwater even when their pond is frozen over.|$|E
5|$|Arrested and exposed, Sideshow Bob confesses that {{he hated}} Krusty {{and the reason}} he framed Krusty was because he spent years {{constantly}} being {{on the receiving end}} of the clown's humiliating gags.

Homer then apologizes to Krusty for fingering him in court, and Krusty thanks Bart for standing up for the truth and <b>sticking</b> to his convictions, and a picture is taken of the two shaking hands (which Bart later hangs in his bedroom, refilled with Krusty decor).|$|E

The fourth <b>stick</b> represents a hitching post because Dan got a black hose named Henry. The fifth and sixth <b>sticks</b> are Dan’s fiddle and bow that he taught himself to play. The seventh <b>stick</b> stands for a 3D image contraption that Dan traded for. The eighth <b>stick</b> represents the law coming for Dan. Flossie, then ninth <b>stick,</b> hides him and his horse. Frankie, Flossie’s daughter, is the tenth <b>stick</b> that Dan and his best friend Swinn, the eleventh <b>stick,</b> fought over.

50|$|To {{play this}} game, two (2) pieces of bamboo <b>sticks</b> (one long, one short) are required. A player {{acts as a}} batter and stands {{opposite}} the others players at a distance. The batter holds the long bamboo <b>stick</b> {{with one hand and}} tosses the short one with the other hand. The batter then strikes the shorter <b>stick</b> with the longer <b>stick.</b> The other players will attempt to catch the flying shorter <b>stick.</b> Whoever catches the <b>stick</b> gets the turn to be the next batter. If nobody catches the <b>stick,</b> any player can pick it up. The batter then puts down the longer <b>stick</b> on the ground. The holder of the shorter <b>stick</b> will throw it with the attempt to hit the longer <b>stick</b> on the ground. If the longer <b>stick</b> is hit, the hitter becomes the next batter. If the player with the shorter <b>stick</b> misses to hit the longer one, the same batter will continue.|$|R

5|$|Dust {{particles}} tend {{to stick}} {{to each other in}} the dense disk environment, leading to the formation of larger particles up to several centimeters in size. The signatures of the dust processing and coagulation are observed in the infrared spectra of the young disks. Further aggregation can lead to the formation of planetesimals measuring 1km across or larger, which are the building blocks of planets. Planetesimal formation is another unsolved problem of disk physics, as simple <b>sticking</b> becomes ineffective as dust particles grow larger.|$|E
5|$|Having honed his {{personal}} style {{as a young}} man, and <b>sticking</b> broadly with {{it for the rest}} of his career, Massenet does not, as some other composers do, lend himself to classification into clearly defined early, middle and late periods. Moreover, his versatility means that there is no plot or locale that can be regarded as typical Massenet. Another respect in which he differed from many opera composers is that he did not work regularly with the same librettists: Grove lists more than thirty writers who provided him with librettos.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, three fossilized Tiktaalik skeletons were {{discovered}} in rock formed from late Devonian river sediments on Ellesmere Island, Nunavut, in northern Canada. Estimated ages reported at 375 MYA, 379 MYA, and 383 MYA. At {{the time of the}} species' existence, Ellesmere Island was part of the continent Laurentia (modern eastern North America and Greenland), which was centered on the equator and had a warm climate. When discovered, one of the skulls was found <b>sticking</b> out of a cliff. Upon further inspection, the fossil was found to be in excellent condition for a 375-million-year-old specimen.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Sticks</b> have {{traditionally}} been made from wood, but in recent years, <b>sticks</b> made of more expensive materials such as aluminum, Aramid (kevlar), fiberglass, carbon fiber, and other composite materials have become common. In addition to weighing less, composite <b>sticks</b> can be manufactured with more consistent flexibility properties than their wooden counterparts. They also {{do not have the}} natural variations that wooden <b>sticks</b> possess therefore a batch of the same <b>sticks</b> will all perform roughly the same. There are die-hard NHL professionals that still like the feel of wood <b>sticks</b> such as Paul Stastny (Son of ice hockey Hall-of-Famer Peter Stastny). Some of these <b>sticks</b> have replaceable wood or composite blades, while others are one piece <b>sticks</b> without a replaceable blade. Composite <b>sticks,</b> despite their greater expense, are now commonplace at nearly all competitive levels of the sport, including youth ice hockey. Some of the top brands of composite <b>sticks</b> include Bauer, Easton, Reebok/CCM, and Warrior. Many professionals are using composite <b>stick</b> technology rather than wooden <b>sticks.</b> These new <b>sticks</b> are lighter and provide a quicker release of the puck, resulting in a harder, more accurate shot. Although the new materials do enable harder shots, the improved durability and lighter materials can make the transition from wooden to composite <b>stick</b> more difficult for less experienced players. A shortcut used by numerous players is to use a weighted system, such as kwik hands, to quickly adjust to the new <b>sticks.</b> More expensive ice hockey <b>sticks</b> (such as the Bauer Vapor APX 2, Bauer Supreme TotalOne NXG, Bauer Nexus 8000, Reebok 20k, Reebok Ribcore, Easton Stealth RS 2, Easton V9 & V9E, Warrior Covert DX1 [...] ) usually are the lightest <b>sticks</b> on the market (390-470 grams in a senior <b>stick).</b> In addition to the increased torque that these composite <b>sticks</b> possess, the <b>sticks</b> do not warp or absorb moisture like their wooden counterparts.|$|R
