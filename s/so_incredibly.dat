Oscar Moralde from Slant Magazine complimented the production of the video by calling it [...] "visually stunning", while adding that [...] "'Judas' is the work of a repertory, not a revolutionary.

[...] Phil Fox Rose, while reviewing the video for The Washington Post, gave it a positive review stating that he found it [...] "moving, both artistically and spiritually."

Two methods of clustering are considered here. K-means clustering defines clusters {{in relation to}} the centroid, or center, of a cluster. Spectral clustering establishes connections between all of the data points to be clustered, then eliminates those connections that link dissimilar points. This is represented as an eigenvector problem where the solution is given by the eigenvectors of the Normalized Graph Laplacian. Spectral clustering establishes groups so that the similarity between points of the same cluster is stronger than similarity between different clusters. K-means and spectral clustering are used to analyze adolescent data from the 2009 California Health Interview Survey. Differences were observed between the results of the clustering methods on 3294 individuals and 22 health-related attributes. K-means clustered the adolescents by exercise, poverty, and variables related to psychological health while spectral clustering groups were informed by smoking, alcohol use, low exercise, psychological distress, low parental involvement, and poverty.

ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) softwares are increasingly being used by businesses to streamline their operations. One of the leading ERP platforms is SAP and is used worldwide. Usage of softwares, be it a simple music player or an ERP software, requires updates and migrations. While the end-user only gets the final products in case of openware or commercial off the shelf software, ERP involves the end-user in the testing phase of the software development lifecycle. The outcome of such tests determines the future performance of the technical solutions and <b>so</b> is <b>incredibly</b> important.

40|$|The {{amount of}} medical digital {{images that are}} {{produced}} in hospitals is increasing <b>incredibly</b> <b>so,</b> the need for systems that can provide efficient segmentation and retrieval of images of particular interest is becoming very high. Image segmentation partitions an image into non overlapping regions, which ideally should be meaningful for a certain purpose. In recent years, many image segmentation algorithms have been developed, but they are often very complex and some undesired results occur frequently. In this paper, we present an effective color image segmentation approach based on pixel classiﬁcation with modified least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM). In this technique, firstly the images are segmented using proposed LS-SVM approach and then its results are compared with performance matrices. This image segmentation not only can fully {{take advantage of the}} local information of color image, but also the ability of LS-SVM classiﬁer and removes the problem of over segmentation. Experimental evidence shows that the proposed method has very effective segmentation results and computational behavior, and decreases the time, increases the quality of color image segmentation and eliminates the problem of over segmentation in comparison with the state-of-the-art segmentation methods recently proposed in the literature...|$|R
