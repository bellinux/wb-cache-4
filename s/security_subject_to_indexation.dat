50|$|HELP debts do not attract {{interest}} (in {{the normal}} sense), but are instead indexed to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) on 1 June each year, {{based on the}} annual CPI to March of that year.

Thus, indexation is calculated on the opening HELP debt balance on 1 July of the previous year plus any debt incurred {{in the first half of}} the current year (usually for first semester courses) less any compulsory and voluntary repayments, with bonus. Any HELP debt incurred on second semester courses (usually determined in June) will not be <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> <b>indexation</b> until the next year.

2500|$|Due to the {{religious}} and cultural values in Pakistan, women who do try to enter the workforce are often pushed into the lower of the three employment structures. This structure level, unorganized services sector, has low pay, low job security and low productivity. In order to improve this situation, governmental organizations and political parties need to push for the entrance of women into the organized services sector. Conservative interpretations of Islam have not promoted women's rights in the workforce, since they value women as keepers of the family honor, support gender segregation, and institutionalization of gender disparities.

40|$|Convertible {{bonds are}} complex hybrid <b>securities</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> {{multiple}} sources of risk. Many exhibit exotic path dependent features. Monte Carlo simulation methods {{are usually the}} favorite choice for solving high-dimensional problems and pricing path dependent securities. This paper breaks away from the tradition established {{in the literature of}} pricing convertible bonds with finite difference and lattice methods, and suggests a simulation methodology for convertible bond pricing. We introduce the dividend process for convertible bonds, and formulate the pricing problem according to the probabilistic martingale approach. The proposed methodology deals with callable and puttable convertible bonds. The early exercise rules are estimated by means of least squares regressions as in Longstaff and Schwartz (2001). The accuracy of the simulation algorithm is tested {{in the context of a}} two factor model. The algorithm performs fairly well, and shows potential for further extension to include many complexities inherent in convertible bonds, as well as additional risk factors. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we test the {{empirical}} {{performance of the}} Das and Sundaram model [2006]. This model is for the pricing of <b>securities</b> <b>subject</b> <b>to</b> equity, interest rate and credit risks. The model is embedded on a bivariate recombining lattice in a risk-neutral setting for the joint evolution of equity prices and forward interest rate curve. Assuming that the stock price drops to zero {{in the event of}} a default, the evolution of the credit risk process is captured on this bivariate lattice by the possibility of the stock price dropping to zero. The probability of this happening at different nodes of the lattice is estimated from the observed credit default swap spreads. We test this model on a sample of risky non-convertible bonds in the American and European markets. We also extend this model to price convertible bonds which are convertible not into the issuer’s stock but the stock of some other company. This paper is preliminary and incomplete.
