5|$|So Beautiful or <b>So</b> <b>What</b> <b>is</b> {{the twelfth}} solo studio album by American folk rock singer-songwriter Paul Simon. For the album, he reunited with former {{collaborator}} and record producer Phil Ramone. Having experimented with rhythm-based textures {{for much of}} the previous two decades, Simon returned to composing songs rather traditionally using only his acoustic guitar. These songs were further augmented by experimental recording practices in the studio. The album was largely recorded in a small cottage at Simon's home in New Canaan, Connecticut.|$|E
5|$|So Far, So Good... So What! (stylized as so far, so good... <b>so</b> <b>what</b> !) <b>is</b> {{the third}} studio album by the American thrash metal band Megadeth, {{released}} on January 19, 1988 by Capitol Records. It is the band's only album recorded with drummer Chuck Behler and guitarist Jeff Young, {{both of whom}} were fired immediately after its subsequent tour. So Far, So Good... So What! features music performed at very fast tempos with technical ability; lyrically, frontman and guitarist Dave Mustaine addresses a variety of topics, including nuclear holocaust and freedom of speech.|$|E
5|$|The chronicle {{continues}} {{by stating}} that Óláfr then {{took control of the}} fleet whereupon he led it to Mann, where he and Guðrøðr divided the kingdom between themselves—with Óláfr retaining Mann, and Guðrøðr controlling the Hebridean portions; in fact, it is possible that Hákon may have originally intended for Óláfr and Guðrøðr to split the kingdom of Mann and the Isles between themselves. According to the saga the Norwegians left in the spring, sailing north to Kintyre where they encountered and battled a strong force of Scots with both sides losing many men during the ensuing battle. The saga then recounts how the fleet sailed north to Lewis and displaced a certain Þórmóðr Þórkelson, before travelling to Orkney, from where most of the fleet sailed back to Norway. Páll, however, is stated to have remained behind, and to have been slain by Guðrøðr several weeks later. The saga notes that Guðrøðr was also slain in the Isles a short time after this. The Chronicle of Mann specifically places Guðrøðr's death on Lewis, although it does not cast any light upon the circumstances. Even <b>so,</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> certain is that it was only after Guðrøðr's death that Óláfr's kingship was safe from any rival claim.|$|E

25|$|Few {{details of}} cricket matches in the 17th and early 18th centuries have survived and <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> known about Bedle's {{career has been}} pieced {{together}} by historical analysis as contemporary newspaper reports rarely mentioned a player by name. The reason for this lack of surviving data is that {{freedom of the press}} was not allowed in England until 1696, when Bedle was 16, and the infant newspaper industry gradually introduced coverage of sporting events, though for many years their emphasis was on betting rather than on the matches themselves. During Bedle's career, cricket reports were not only brief but few and far between.|$|E

500|$|The protein {{products}} of the regulatory toolkit are reused not by duplication and modification, but by a complex mosaic of pleiotropy, being applied unchanged in many independent developmental processes, giving pattern to many dissimilar body structures. The loci of these pleiotropic toolkit genes have large, complicated and modular cis-regulatory elements. For example, while a non-pleiotropic rhodopsin gene in the fruit fly has a cis-regulatory element {{just a few hundred}} base pairs long, the pleiotropic eyeless cis-regulatory region contains 6 cis-regulatory elements in over 7000 base pairs. The regulatory networks involved are often very large. Each regulatory protein controls [...] "scores to hundreds" [...] of cis-regulatory elements. For instance, 67 fruit fly transcription factors controlled on average 124 target genes each. All this complexity enables genes involved {{in the development of the}} embryo to be switched on and off at exactly the right times and in exactly the right places. Some of these genes are structural, directly forming enzymes, tissues and organs of the embryo. But many others are themselves regulatory genes, <b>so</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> switched on is often a precisely-timed cascade of switching, involving turning on one developmental process after another in the developing embryo.|$|E
