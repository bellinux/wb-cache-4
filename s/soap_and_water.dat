Other treatments include washing the stung area with <b>soap</b> <b>and</b> <b>water,</b> and if continuous pain remains for several days, antihistamine tablets are taken for one to three days.|$|E
5|$|Burns are {{generally}} preventable. Treatment {{depends on the}} severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with <b>soap</b> <b>and</b> <b>water,</b> followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection. Tetanus toxoid should be given if not up to date.|$|E

25|$|The Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA {{recommends}} {{hand washing}} over hand sanitizer rubs, particularly when hands are visibly dirty.

25|$|Some {{studies suggest}} that {{antimicrobial}} hand soaps containing triclosan provide a slightly greater bacterial reduction on the hands compared to plain soap. , the US FDA had found clear benefit to health for some consumer products containing triclosan, but not in others; for example the FDA had no evidence that triclosan in antibacterial soaps and body washes provides any benefit over washing with regular <b>soap</b> <b>and</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
25|$|Rigorous {{infection}} protocols {{are required}} to minimize this risk of transmission. Infection control measures, such as wearing gloves and noncritical medical devices used for a single person with CDI, are effective at prevention. This works by limiting the spread of C. difficile in the hospital setting. In addition, washing with <b>soap</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> will eliminate the spores from contaminated hands, but alcohol-based hand rubs are ineffective.|$|E

25|$|Hand washing with <b>soap</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> is an {{effective}} method for reducing the transmission of norovirus pathogens. Alcohol rubs (≥62% ethanol) {{may be used as}} an adjunct, but are less effective than hand-washing, as norovirus lacks a lipid viral envelope. Surfaces where norovirus particles may be present can be sanitised with a solution of 1.5% to 7.5% of household bleach in water, or other disinfectants effective against norovirus.|$|E
25|$|Many organizations, {{including}} the American Medical Association and American Red Cross, recommend washing the bite with <b>soap</b> <b>and</b> <b>water.</b> Australian recommendations for snake bite treatment recommend against cleaning the wound.

30|$|Chloride for {{influent}} was 69.15 [*]±[*] 5.07  mg/l while as for effluent {{the value}} increased to 82.83 [*]±[*] 6.59  mg/l {{with an increase}} of 19.78 %. Significant variation in chloride was recorded within (F 11 [*]=[*] 10.18, P[*]<[*] 0.05) and among (F 1 [*]=[*] 74.85, P[*]<[*] 0.05) the influent and effluent. Higher concentration of chloride in sewage may result from the higher usage of washing agents like detergents, <b>soaps</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> filtering units, sodium chloride and also by discharging fecal matter (Von Sperling 1996). Chloride ion concentration {{is an important factor}} to be considered if the effluent is used for irrigation. Cl exhibited significant negative correlation with Ca (r[*]=[*]−[*] 0.646; P[*]<[*] 0.05) which indicates there are different sources as Ca is mainly attributed by catchment.|$|R
25|$|If stung, {{the site}} will appear red and may remain itchy and swollen for many days. The best {{treatment}} of stings is to first wash the area with <b>soap</b> <b>and</b> <b>water,</b> then use an antiseptic, and if swelling remains apply an ice pack. Many people are allergic to wasp venom, {{and if this is}} the case, a sting can result in severe anaphylactic shock. Symptoms of this include swelling of airways, including mouth lips and tongue, troubled breathing, dizziness and tightness of chest. If an individual exhibits any of these symptoms after acquiring a sting from R. romandi seek medical attention immediately.|$|E
25|$|Medical hand-washing is for {{a minimum}} of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of <b>soap</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> or gel to lather and rub each part of the hands. Hands should be rubbed {{together}} with digits interlocking. If there is debris under fingernails, a bristle brush may be used to remove it. Since germs may remain in the water on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe dry with a clean towel. After drying, the paper towel should be used to turn off the water (and open any exit door if necessary). This avoids re-contaminating the hands from those surfaces.|$|E
25|$|Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers {{can cause}} dry skin unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers {{are added to}} the formula. The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or {{eliminated}} by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula. In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused substantially less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents. Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in alcohol hand rubs rarely occur. The lower tendency to induce irritant contact dermatitis became an attraction as compared to <b>soap</b> <b>and</b> <b>water</b> hand washing.|$|E
25|$|If latex or root juice {{gets on the}} skin, {{the victim}} should {{immediately}} wash with <b>soap</b> <b>and</b> warm <b>water.</b> If latex or juice gets in the eye, continuous rinsing with fresh water {{should be the first}} course of action. Topical steroids are indicated for skin or eye contact. Intravenous fluids are often administered to counteract the fluid loss due to vomiting and diarrhea.|$|R
50|$|Side effects include dry skin, stinging, redness, and itchy rash (urticaria), with {{recommended}} usage is 2 {{times per}} day, {{once in the}} morning and once in the evening, or as prescribed by a doctor. The affected area should be washed with <b>soap</b> <b>and</b> warm <b>water,</b> rinsed, <b>and</b> gently dried before applying the gel. Using an oil-free face moisturizer in conjunction with Benzamycin is recommended.|$|R
50|$|Avoiding food {{or water}} that may be {{contaminated}} with stool can help prevent the infection of Cystoisospora (Isosporiasis). Good hand-washing, and personal-hygiene practices should be used as well. One should wash their hands with <b>soap</b> <b>and</b> warm <b>water</b> after using the toilet, changing diapers, and before handling food (CDC.gov). It {{is also important to}} teach children the importance of washing their hands, and how to properly wash their hands.|$|R
