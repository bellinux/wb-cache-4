5|$|Unlike {{most other}} land carnivorans, bears are plantigrade. They {{distribute}} their weight toward the hind feet, {{which makes them}} look lumbering when they walk. They are capable of bursts of speed but soon tire, {{and as a result}} mostly rely on ambush rather than the chase. Bears can stand on their hind feet and <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> with remarkable balance. Their front paws are flexible enough to grasp fruit and leaves. Bears' non-retractable claws are used for digging, climbing, tearing, and catching prey. The claws on the front feet are larger than those on the back and may be a hindrance when climbing trees; black bears are the most arboreal of the bears, and have the shortest claws. Pandas are unique in having a bony extension on the wrist of the front feet which acts as a thumb, and is used for gripping bamboo shoots as the animals feed.|$|E
25|$|Following the marriage, Tudor {{transferred}} to the 3rd Battalion, the Royal Tank Corps, which was based at Lydd, Kent, England. Larissa was ill with pulmonary tuberculosis and spinal caries {{and was unable to}} <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight.</b> She spent her days reclining in an elongated bath chair. The couple lived privately, but were often overheard laughing in the garden of their house. Though Tudor's income had been reduced when he left the Hussars and he had no personal fortune, he had enough money to pay for a nurse for Larissa and to keep a horse stabled at a nearby farm.|$|E
25|$|As a young child, Gould {{was taught}} piano by his mother. At {{the age of}} 10, he began {{attending}} The Royal Conservatory of Music (known until 1947, when it received a Royal Charter from King George VI, as the Toronto Conservatory of Music) in Toronto. He studied music theory with Leo Smith, the organ with Frederick C. Silvester, and piano with Alberto Guerrero. Around the same time, he injured his back {{as a result of}} a fall from a boat ramp on the shore of Lake Simcoe. This incident is almost certainly related to the adjustable-height chair his father made shortly thereafter. Gould's mother would urge the young Gould to <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> at the keyboard. He used this chair for the rest of his life and took it with him almost everywhere. The famous chair was designed so that Gould could sit very low at the keyboard. The chair allowed him to pull down on the keys rather than striking them from above, a central technical idea of his teacher at the Conservatory, Alberto Guerrero.|$|E

Then {{of a sudden}} he caught sight of {{something}} that made him <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> <b>straighter</b> than ever and open his eyes very wide. Something was following Peter Rabbit. Yes, Sir, something was bobbing along right at Peter Rabbit's heels.|$|R
60|$|When {{they reached}} the patch of tender, sweet, young clover, Johnny Chuck would <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> very <b>straight</b> and still, {{watching}} as sharp as he knew how for the least sign of danger. When the three little stomachs were full of sweet, tender, young clover, he would proudly lead the way home again, and then as before he would <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> very <b>straight</b> and watch for danger, while the three baby Chucks sprawledout on the doorstep for a sun-nap.|$|R
2500|$|Wesley was {{initially}} {{designed to be}} a foil for the character of Rupert Giles. Actor Alexis Denisof comments that Wesley and Giles come from very similar backgrounds, but have gone in different directions [...] "with the tools that they had"; he was conceived as a [...] "nemesis" [...] for Giles and Buffy. Co-executive producer Doug Petrie, who wrote Wesley's first episode [...] "Bad Girls", explains, [...] "The way Faith is a reflection of Buffy, Wesley takes up a lot of the space that Giles traditionally occupies." [...] He elaborates that, because Giles is usually the [...] "stuffy guy from England who tells you to <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> and obey the rules", introducing Wesley, who embodies those traits [...] "to the nth degree", allows Giles to become [...] "subversive" [...] and [...] "cool". Writer Jane Espenson claims that the character was intended for viewers to have antipathy towards, since he was trying to undermine Giles.|$|E

60|$|So Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck {{lay down}} in the grass to rest while Johnny Chuck {{recovered}} his breath. Every minute or two Peter would <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> very <b>straight,</b> prick <b>up</b> his long ears and look this way and look that way as if he expected to see something unusual. It made Johnny Chuck nervous.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile {{three or}} four more are {{swimming}} about the dam, surveying the damage there. One dives to the bottom, but comes up in a moment to report all safe below. Another is tugging at a thick pole just below you. Slowly he tows it out in front, balances a moment and lets it go--good!--squarely across the break. Two others are cutting alders above; and here come the bushes floating down. Over at the damaged house two beavers are up on the walls, raising the rafters into place; a third appears to be laying on the outer covering and plastering it with mud. Now and then one <b>sits</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> like a rabbit, listens, stretches his back to get the kinks out, then drops to his work again.|$|R
60|$|So Clote Scarpe, {{the great}} chief who was kind to all animals, gave Upweekis a soft gray coat {{that is almost}} {{invisible}} in the woods, summer or winter, and made his feet large, and padded them with soft fur; so that indeed he is like the shadows that play, for you can neither see nor hear him. But Clote Scarpe remembered Moktaques the rabbit also, and gave him two coats, a brown one for summer and a white one for winter. Consequently he is harder than ever to see when he is quiet; and Upweekis must still depend upon his wits to catch him. As Upweekis has few wits to spare, Moktaques often sees him close at hand, and chuckles in his form under the brown ferns, or <b>sits</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> under the snow-covered hemlock tips, and watches the big lynx at his hunting.|$|R
60|$|LESBIA. The Chinese {{know what}} a man is like when he is cut into a {{thousand}} pieces, or boiled in oil. That sort of knowledge is of no use to me.

6000|$|He arrives just as {{regularly}} as {{the clock}} strikes nine in the morning. And so he even beats the editor sometimes, and the porter must leave his work and climb two or three pairs of stairs to unlock the [...] "Sanctum" [...] door and let him in. He lights one of the office pipes--not reflecting, perhaps, that the editor {{may be one of}} those [...] "stuck-up" [...] people who would as soon have a stranger defile his tooth-brush as his pipe-stem. Then he begins to loll--for a person who can consent to loaf his useless life away in ignominious indolence has not the energy to <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{happened}} to be reading a book many hundreds of years old, which told of remedies {{for all kinds of}} diseases. Most of them, he knew, were merely invented by old women, who sought to prove themselves wiser than other people; but at length he came to something which caused him to <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> in his chair, and made his eyes brighten. This was the description of a balsam--which would cure every kind of sore or wound--distilled from a plant only to be found in a country so distant that it would take a man on foot two months to go and come back again.|$|E
60|$|Look {{under the}} crimson sumach yonder, {{there in the}} bit of brown grass, with the purple asters hanging over, {{and you will find}} his form, where he has been sitting all the morning and where he watched you {{all the way up the}} hill. But you need not follow; you will not find him again. He never runs straight; the swaying leaves there where he {{disappeared}} mark the beginning of his turn, whether to right or left you will never know. Now he has come around his circle and is near you again--watching you this minute, out of his bit of brown grass. As you move slowly away in the direction he took, peering here and there among the bushes, Bunny behind you <b>sits</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> in his old form again, with his little paws held very prim, his long ears pointed after you, and his deep brown eyes shining like the waters of a hidden spring among the asters. And he chuckles to himself, and thinks how he fooled you that time, sure.|$|R
6000|$|Then each little Chuck would <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> very <b>straight</b> and {{not move}} the teeniest, weeniest bit, so {{that from a}} little {{distance}} they looked {{for all the world}} like tiny stumps. But all the time their sharp little eyes would be looking this way and that way, to see what the danger might be. After a while Johnny would give another little whistle, which meant [...] "Danger past." [...] Then they would once more begin to fill their little stomachs with sweet, tender, young clover.|$|R
60|$|After frisking about {{he would}} stop to rest. Then he would <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> very <b>straight</b> and fold his hands across his breast, where they would get nice and warm in the fur of his coat. His beautiful, great gray tail would be arched up over his back. His bright eyes would snap and twinkle, {{and then he would}} shout just for joy, and every time he shouted he jerked his big tail. Farmer Brown's boy called it barking, but it was Happy Jack's way of shouting.|$|R

"'Mr. Rabbit,' {{continued}} old Mother Nature, 'because your curiosity is so great, {{your ears}} shall be made long, {{that every one}} who sees you may {{know that it is}} not safe to talk when you are near. Because you are a sneak and steal up to people unseen, your-hind legs shall be made long, so that whenever you <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> you will be tall and every one can see you, and whenever you run, you will go with great jumps, and every one will know who it is running away. And because you are shiftless and your house leaks, you will hereafter live in a hole in the ground.' ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{although}} {{we could see}} so much sitting on benches, I didn't give up Jone and the bath-chairs, and day before yesterday I {{got the better of}} him. [...] "Now," [...] said I, [...] "it is stupid for you to be sitting around in this way as if you was a statue of a public benefactor carved by subscription and set up in a park. The only sensible thing for you to do is to take a bath-chair and go around and see things. And if you are afraid people will think you are being taken to a hospital, you can put down the top of the thing, and <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> and smoke your pipe. Patients in ambulances never smoke pipes. And if you don't want me walking by your side like a trained nurse, I'll take another chair and be pulled along with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{gave it up}} at last; I said I’d row bow. Bow {{thought the}} {{arrangement}} would be better too, and we changed places. The ladies gave an involuntary sigh of relief when they saw me go, and quite brightened up for a moment. Poor girls! they had better have put up with me. The man they had got now was a jolly, light-hearted, thick-headed sort of a chap, with about as much sensitiveness in him as there {{might be in a}} Newfoundland puppy. You might look daggers at him for an hour and he would not notice it, and it would not trouble him if he did. He set a good, rollicking, dashing stroke that sent the spray playing all over the boat like a fountain, and made the whole crowd <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> <b>straight</b> in no time. When he spread more than pint of water over one of those dresses, he would give a pleasant little laugh, and say: ...|$|E
6000|$|And when we bury {{our face}} {{in our hands}} and wish we had never been born, they don't <b>sit</b> <b>up</b> very <b>straight</b> and observe that we have brought it all upon ourselves. They don't even {{hope it will be}} a warning to us. But they come up softly and shove their heads against us. If it is a cat she stands on your shoulder, rumples your hair, and says, [...] "Lor,' I am sorry for you, old man," [...] as plain as words can speak; and if it is a dog he looks up at you with his big, true eyes and says with them, [...] "Well you've always got me, you know. We'll go through the world {{together}} and always stand by each other, won't we?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Later that year, AVIE also {{released}} Sorrell's disc of Vivaldi concertos, La Follia (Madness). The Independent wrote, “Under the inspired {{direction of}} Sorrell, Apollo’s Fire {{has become one}} of the pre-eminent period-instrument ensembles, causing one to hear familiar baroque material anew.” [...] The American Record Guide called it [...] "an outstanding collection, performed by a terrific early instrument orchestra" [...] while the Cleveland Plain Dealer described it as [...] "vivid, earthy and ardent… Be prepared to <b>sit</b> <b>straight</b> <b>up.</b> Baroque chestnuts sound utterly new in the crisp, vital performances that Sorrell shapes.” ...|$|R

I see one little girl who is looking out of the window--I am afraid she thinks I am out there somewhere--perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech to the little birds. [Applausive titter.] I want to tell you how good it makes me feel to see so many bright, clean little faces assembled in a place like this, learning to do right and be good." [...] And so forth and so on. It is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration. It was of a pattern which does not vary, and so it is familiar to us all.|$|R

5000|$|Embodied {{space is}} the way males and females {{familiarize}} with their bodies in their surroundings and often compare to each other. [...] The area of personal and interpersonal space tends to be diverse and has various levels for different genders {{and how it is}} used to disciple one’s self and others. Males and females also experience their bodies in different ways such as females are more guarded in the way they experience their bodies than males who are less guarded. The size of personal space also had to do with gender. Females compared to males take up less space and males tend to spread out. An example would be when a female sits in a chair they normally <b>sit</b> <b>straight</b> <b>up</b> with legs crossed and when male sits in the chair they sprawl out and legs are spread.|$|R
