5|$|John N. <b>Shive</b> {{was born}} in Baltimore, Maryland, on February 22, 1913, {{and grew up in}} New Jersey. <b>Shive</b> {{graduated}} from Rutgers University with a BS in physics and chemistry in 1934. He also earned a PhD from Johns Hopkins University, submitting a dissertation Practice and theory of the modulation of Geiger counters in 1939. <b>Shive</b> became a fellow of the American Physical Society, a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and {{was a member of the}} Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi fraternities.|$|E

5|$|In {{this new}} role, he invented the <b>Shive</b> wave machine (also {{known as the}} <b>Shive</b> wave {{generator}}). The wave generator illustrates wave motion using a series of steel rods joined by a thin torsion wire which transmits energy from one rod to the next. The high moment of inertia of each rod ensures the wave takes several seconds to traverse the entire series of rods, making the dynamics easily visible. The motion is analogous to high-frequency waves that are invisible to the human eye, such as electromagnetic waves on a transmission line. The wave generator could illustrate wave reflection, standing waves, resonance, partial reflection, and impedance matching. <b>Shive</b> made two educational films in which he demonstrated the machine, Simple Waves and Similarities in Wave Behavior, and wrote a book with the same name as the latter.|$|E
5|$|<b>Shive</b> was {{a gifted}} lecturer, and became Director of Education and Training at Bell Telephone Laboratories. He was {{responsible}} for curriculum and administration of educational programs provided to employees of Bell Laboratories.|$|E
5|$|In 1948 <b>Shive</b> {{invented the}} {{phototransistor}} that used {{a beam of}} light, instead of a wire, as the emitter of a point contact transistor, generating holes that flow to the collector. It was not announced until 1950. This invention embodies the modern day nationwide direct distance dialing system.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the most effective technique for extraction of phenolics present in flax <b>shives</b> and to assess their effect on human fibroblasts. Flax <b>shives</b> are by-products of fibre separation, but they were found to be a rich source of phenolic compounds and thus might have application potential. It was found that the optimal procedure for extraction of phenolics was hydrolysis enhanced by the ultrasound with NaOH for 24 [*]h at 65 °C and subsequent extraction with ethyl acetate. The influence of the flax <b>shives</b> extract on fibroblast growth and viability was assessed using the MTT and SRB tests. Moreover, the influence of flax <b>shives</b> extract on the extracellular matrix remodelling process was verified. The 20 % increase of the viability was observed upon flax <b>shives</b> extract treatment and the decrease of mRNA collagen genes, an increase of matrix metalloproteinase gene expression, and reduction in levels of interleukin 6, interleukin 10, and suppressor of cytokinin signaling 1 mRNA were observed. Alterations in MCP- 1 mRNA levels were dependent on flax <b>shives</b> extract concentration. Thus, we suggested the possible application of flax <b>shives</b> extract in the wound healing process...|$|R

50|$|While nursing {{him back}} to health, Kaaya is {{attracted}} to <b>Shiven,</b> an exciting feeling she has never experienced before. <b>Shiven</b> too finds himself drawn to Kaya, a girl unlike any he has ever known. Kaya is caught in a dilemma for she has too long subdued her basic instincts and desires in her search for the 'ultimate truth'. A sexual attraction is one that her conditioned mind sees as a sin (paap), but one she cannot deny. <b>Shiven</b> sees this dilemma and tries to show Kaya {{that there is a}} life out there which she has a full right to live. In the meantime, Kaya's father finds out about what has been going on under his roof and is furious with <b>Shiven.</b> He sees <b>Shiven</b> as a polluting influence upon his peaceful life, a man who has brought defiling things like pistols into their home. At this juncture, Shiven's past catches up with them and Mehra's men are close on his heels.|$|R
50|$|The Setralit {{techniques}} are applied either on crushed dry straw of bast fiber plants (mechanical fiber extraction) or on decorticated fibers (long fibers, flax tow). In {{the first case}} the fiber has to be separated mechanically, after the ultrasonic break-down, from its non-fibrous components (<b>shives).</b> As a benefit one gets clean <b>shives</b> as a byproduct which {{can serve as a}} raw material for high quality fiber powder. With the help of modified Setralit techniques the <b>shives</b> may also be upgraded separately.|$|R
25|$|Hemp <b>shives</b> are {{the core}} of the stem, hemp hurds are broken parts of the core. In the EU, they are used for animal bedding (horses, for instance), or for horticultural mulch.

25|$|A {{phototransistor}} is a light-sensitive transistor. A {{common type}} of phototransistor, called a photobipolar transistor, is in essence a bipolar transistor encased in a transparent case so that light can reach the base–collector junction. It was invented by Dr. John N. <b>Shive</b> (more famous for his wave machine) at Bell Labs in 1948, {{but it was not}} announced until 1950. The electrons that are generated by photons in the base–collector junction are injected into the base, and this photodiode current is amplified by the transistor's current gain β (or hfe). If the base and collector leads are used and the emitter is left unconnected, the phototransistor becomes a photodiode. While phototransistors have a higher responsivity for light they are not able to detect low levels of light any better than photodiodes. Phototransistors also have significantly longer response times. Field-effect phototransistors, also known as photoFETs, are light-sensitive field-effect transistors. Unlike photobipolar transistors, photoFETs control drain-source current by creating a gate voltage.|$|E
25|$|The soft spile in the <b>shive</b> allows gas to vent off. This {{can be seen}} by {{the bubbles}} foaming around the spile. The {{landlord}} will periodically check the bubbles by wiping the spile clean and then watching to see how fast the bubbles reform. There still has to be some life in the beer otherwise it will taste flat. When the beer is judged to be ready, the landlord will replace the soft spile with a hard one (which doesn't allow air in or gas out) and let the beer settle for 24 hours. They will also knock a tap into the end of the cask. This might simply be a tap if the cask is stored behind the bar. The beer will then be served simply under gravity pressure: turn on the tap, and the beer comes out. But if the cask is in the cellar, the beer needs to travel via tubes, or beer lines, and be pumped up to the bar area, normally using a handpump also known as a 'beer engine'.|$|E
50|$|The fiber {{containing}} <b>shives</b> and knots {{are separated}} {{from the rest of}} the reject and reprocessed either in a refiner or is sent back to the digester. The content of knots is typically 0.5 - 3.0% of the digester output, while the <b>shives</b> content is about 0.1- 1.0%.|$|R

500|$|John Northrup <b>Shive</b> (February 22, 1913 [...] June 1, 1984) was an American {{physicist}} and inventor. [...] He made notable contributions in electronic engineering and solid-state physics {{during the early}} days of transistor development at Bell Laboratories. [...] In particular, he produced experimental evidence that holes could diffuse through bulk germanium, and not just along the surface as previously thought. This paved the way from Bardeen and Brattain's point contact transistor to Shockley's more-robust junction transistor. <b>Shive</b> is best known for inventing the phototransistor in 1948 (a device that combines the sensitivity to light of a photodiode and the current gain of a transistor), and for the <b>Shive</b> wave machine in 1959 (an educational apparatus used to illustrate wave motion).|$|E
500|$|John N. <b>Shive</b> joined Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1939. <b>Shive</b> worked {{initially}} {{on physical}} research and device development, {{and later on}} education and training.

[...] The spherical sundial on campus, in front of the bookstore and next to the library, is dedicated to his memory for his lifelong desire and service toward improving the teaching of physics.|$|E
