CA19-9 (carbohydrate antigen 19.9) is a tumor marker that is frequently elevated in pancreatic cancer.

40|$|Serologic {{analyses}} of antisera raised in mouse strain combinations differing {{at the major}} histocompatibility complex (H- 2) indicate that each H. 2 haplotype is characterized by numerous antigenic <b>specificities.</b> It has been proposed that the data are most easily {{explained in terms of}} two tightly linked loci, H- 2 K and H- 2 D (1 - 3). This "two-gene " model implies that the product of each H- 2 K or H- 2 D region bears several alloantigenic <b>specificities.</b> Antigenic <b>specificities</b> unique for a single H- 2 K or H- 2 D region, or regions presumed to be of a common origin, have been designated "private " <b>specificities,</b> while antigenic <b>specificities</b> shared between different regions or different alleles of a region have been designated "public " <b>specificities.</b> The molecules determined by the H- 2 K and H- 2 D region are glycoproteins of an apparent mol wt of 45, 000 daltons. Cullen et al.

5|$|One {{reason for}} the {{popularity}} of the local protein synthesis hypothesis is that it provides a possible mechanism for the <b>specificity</b> associated with LTP. Specifically, if indeed local protein synthesis underlies L-LTP, only dendritic spines receiving LTP-inducing stimuli will undergo LTP; the potentiation will not be propagated to adjacent synapses. By contrast, global protein synthesis that occurs in the cell body requires that proteins be shipped out to every area of the cell, including synapses that have not received LTP-inducing stimuli. Whereas local protein synthesis provides a mechanism for <b>specificity,</b> global protein synthesis would seem to directly compromise it. However, as discussed later, the synaptic tagging hypothesis successfully reconciles global protein synthesis, synapse <b>specificity,</b> and associativity.|$|E

30|$|Kirk (1964) first {{identified}} two family patterns which differ {{according to the}} recognition of the adoption <b>specificities,</b> highlighting the relevance of open communication between adopters and adoptees. Parents who rejected adoptive family <b>specificities</b> avoided talking about the adoptees’ origins and showed less empathy towards the child’s birth family. Parents who acknowledged the adoption <b>specificities</b> accepted the adoptee’s connection with both families, and empathised more with his/her birth family. This last family pattern predicted a more positive family dynamic. Later on, Brodzinsky (1990) showed that some parents exaggerated in acknowledging the adoption <b>specificities</b> by insisting on the differences specially when facing conflicts. In these cases, the message that was put across focused on the adoptive status as a problem for the family (Palacios & Sanchez-Sandoval, 2005). Thus, parents’ attitudes should vary across different moments of the family lifespan. Sometimes, it is necessary to reject or minimise the adoption <b>specificities,</b> while in other situations, it is better to acknowledge the existing differences (Brodzinsky 1990).|$|R
40|$|Fifteen {{hybridoma}} anti-poly(Glu 60 Ala 30 Tyr 10) (anti-GAT) antibodies {{were analyzed}} {{for the presence}} of a common set of idiotypic <b>specificities</b> associated with murine anti-GAT antibodies, termed CGAT idiotype, which are present on the anti-GAT antibodies of all mouse strains. Thirteen of these monoclonal anti-GAT antibodies expressed a major fraction of CGAT idiotypic <b>specificities.</b> However, the remaining fraction of CGAT idiotypic <b>specificities</b> were not detected in individual or pooled hybridoma anti-GAT antibodies. Anti-idiotypic antisera made against each of the 15 hybridoma anti-GAT antibodies preferentially bound homologous ligand and showed minimal binding activity to specifically purified serum anti-GAT antibodies. Furthermore, the diversity of the hybridoma anti-GAT antibodies was demonstrated by the presence of individual idiotypic <b>specificities</b> on each of the hybridoma anti-GAT antibodies. However, relatedness among some of the hybridoma antibodies was also apparent since idiotypic analysis revealed that some hybridoma anti-GAT antibodies shared cross-reactive idiotypic <b>specificities</b> not associated with CGAT idiotype. The genetic mechanisms which could account for the generation of such antibody diversity are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Glycan arrays {{have enabled}} {{detailed}} {{studies of the}} <b>specificities</b> of glycan-binding proteins. A challenge {{in the interpretation of}} glycan array data is to determine the specific features of glycan structures that are critical for binding. To address this challenge, we have developed a systematic method to interpret glycan array data using a motif-based analysis. Each glycan on a glycan array is classified according to its component sub-structures, or motifs. We analyze the binding of a given lectin to each glycan in terms of the motifs in order to identify the motifs that are selectively present in the glycans that are bound by the lectin. We compared two different methods to calculate the identification, termed intensity segregation and motif segregation, for the analysis of three well-characterized lectins with highly divergent behaviors. Both methods accurately identified the primary <b>specificities</b> as well as the weaker, secondary <b>specificities</b> of all three lectins. The complex binding behavior of wheat germ agglutinin was reduced to its simplified, independent <b>specificities.</b> We compiled the motif <b>specificities</b> {{of a wide variety of}} plant lectins, human lectins, and glycan-binding antibodies to uncover the relationships among the glycan-binding proteins and to provide a means to search for lectins with particular binding <b>specificities.</b> This approach should be valuable for rapidly analyzing and using glycan array data, for better describing and understanding glycan-binding <b>specificities,</b> and as a means to systematize and compare data from glycan arrays...|$|R

5|$|The {{efficiency}} of an enzyme {{can be expressed}} in terms of kcat/Km. This is also called the <b>specificity</b> constant and incorporates the rate constants for all steps in the reaction up to and including the first irreversible step. Because the <b>specificity</b> constant reflects both affinity and catalytic ability, it is useful for comparing different enzymes against each other, or the same enzyme with different substrates. The theoretical maximum for the <b>specificity</b> constant is called the diffusion limit and is about 108 to 109 (M−1 s−1). At this point every collision of the enzyme with its substrate will result in catalysis, and the rate of product formation is not limited by the reaction rate but by the diffusion rate. Enzymes with this property are called catalytically perfect or kinetically perfect. Example of such enzymes are triose-phosphate isomerase, carbonic anhydrase, acetylcholinesterase, catalase, fumarase, β-lactamase, and superoxide dismutase. The turnover of such enzymes can reach several million reactions per second.|$|E

40|$|Proteins with sequence-specific DNA binding {{function}} {{are important}} {{for a wide range}} of biological activities. De novo prediction of their DNA-binding <b>specificities</b> from sequence alone would be a great aid in inferring cellular networks. Here we introduce a method for predicting DNA-binding <b>specificities</b> for Cys 2 His 2 zinc fingers (C 2 H 2 -ZFs), the largest family of DNA-binding proteins in metazoans. We develop a general approach, based on empirical calculations of pairwise amino acid–nucleotide interaction energies, for predicting position weight matrices (PWMs) representing DNA-binding <b>specificities</b> for C 2 H 2 -ZF proteins. We predict DNA-binding <b>specificities</b> on a per-finger basis and merge predictions for C 2 H 2 -ZF domains that are arrayed within sequences.

5|$|Despite the {{similarity}} in how proteins bind the two coenzymes, enzymes almost always show {{a high level}} of <b>specificity</b> for either NAD or NADP. This <b>specificity</b> reflects the distinct metabolic roles of the respective coenzymes, and is the result of distinct sets of amino acid residues in the two types of coenzyme-binding pocket. For instance, in the active site of NADP-dependent enzymes, an ionic bond is formed between a basic amino acid side-chain and the acidic phosphate group of NADP. On the converse, in NAD-dependent enzymes the charge in this pocket is reversed, preventing NADP from binding. However, there are a few exceptions to this general rule, and enzymes such as aldose reductase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase can use both coenzymes in some species.|$|E
