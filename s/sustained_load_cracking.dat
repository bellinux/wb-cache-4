Both material anisotropy and the tetragonal {{nature of the}} distortion induced in the iron crystal structure by interstitial hydrogen were incorporated. Results show that, unlike {{the case of a}} spherical distortion, a strong coupling exists between the strain field of the interstitial hydrogen and the stress field of the crack for orientations of the crack plane that are not coincident with the cube axes of the lattice.

40|$|Abstract. Hydride-induced {{embrittlement}} is {{one type}} of material deterioration caused by hydrogen in metals such as zirconium, titanium, magnesium, niobium and vanadium. According to in-situ electron microscopy studies, embrittlement may occur by the precipitation of brittle hydrides at stress concentration locations. The fracture of the hydrides could lead to delayed hydride cracking, which is a sub-critical crack growth mechanism operating by the repetition of hydride precipitation and fracture near the crack tip. In the present work, steady-state sub-critical crack growth in α-titanium is investigated. It is confirmed that hydride precipitation has a strong effect on the hydrostatic stress level ahead of the propagating crack and leads to significant deviations from the well-known near-tip stress distributions in elastic-plastic materials. The threshold stress intensity factor for <b>sustained</b> <b>load</b> <b>cracking</b> is predicted by considering {{the distribution of the}} hoop stress on the crack plane. The extent of the hydride-rich zone near the crack tip is also calculated and used for the estimation of the velocity of the crack within stage-II regime.

40|$|AbstractThe present {{investigation}} aims {{to clarify the}} mechanisms behind hold-time fatigue crack growth in Alloy 718 by using well designed tests where the crack length is carefully monitored. The results indicate {{that there is a}} significant embrittlement in a zone ahead of the crack tip during the hold-time, which is cracked open on the next load reversal. This leads to a very large cyclic contribution to the total crack length increment during a cycle, orders of magnitude larger than expected from purely cyclic tests at higher frequencies. During the hold-time follows the growth determined from pure <b>sustained</b> <b>load</b> tests, with the exception of an initial transient after the opening of the embrittled zone. An attempt to model the crack growth rate was made using a superposition model where the crack growth increments from high frequency da/dN testing and <b>sustained</b> <b>load</b> tests were added. The predictions of the total crack growth rate are generally adequate, but when the predictions of the individual contributions are scrutinized, {{it is obvious that the}} simple model does not correlate with the physical reality. Therefore both inter- and extrapolations from such a model are uncertain. Further, the test results show a decreased <b>sustained</b> <b>load</b> <b>crack</b> growth immediately after unloading/reloading of the crack.

40|$|A high γ' volume {{fraction}} Ni-base superalloy (RR 1000) {{has been studied}} and its microstructural and mechanical response to the inertia welding process assessed. The bond line microstructure has been characterised in terms of process parameters and associated modelled temperature distributions. The high temperature mechanical behaviour has been interrogated via <b>sustained</b> <b>load</b> <b>crack</b> growth testing in air and vacuum. The weld microstructure is characterised by a uni-modal distribution of ultrafine γ' and a meta-dynamically recrystallised grain structure. The recrystallised grain size {{is determined by the}} width of the shear zone and the associated deformation behaviour, which varies with process parameter selection. Of particular importance is the welding pressure, which controls the upset rate, thereby limiting the shear zone width. A restricted shear zone can be related to increases in the peak bond line temperature and cooling rate. The high temperature crack growth behaviour is controlled by grain boundary oxide formation and crack tip stress state. In inertia welded RR 1000 this stress state is governed by the reprecipitated γ'. The steady state crack growth rate increases with temperature, which is due to an increased rate of oxide formation. Near threshold growth behaviour is also dependent on localised microstructural features. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} improve aero engine {{efficiency}} there has been continuing development on materials to enable engine components such as turbine discs to be operated successfully under more rigorous conditions (Ewing et al., 2003).

However, the main threat to turbine disc life is the initiation and propagation of fatigue cracks and so an understanding of crack nucleation and growth under mechanical loading is vital if in service failures are to be avoided.

40|$|The {{high-temperature}} <b>sustained</b> <b>load</b> <b>crack</b> growth behaviour of a Ni-base superalloy {{was investigated}} {{using a combination}} of mechanical testing in controlled atmosphere, fractographical and microanalytical investigations, and finite element modelling. The results show that the local crack front geometry is un-even on two scales - jaggedness on the scale of 100. μm was observed in all specimens, whereas mm-scale waviness could occasionally be observed. The jaggedness can be explained by a percolation-type crack growth along weaker grain boundaries, whereas the large-scale waviness is presumably due to larger regions of the material having specific grain texture with high crack growth resistance. The un-even crack front is shown to potentially have considerable effects on the loading conditions at the crack tip, whereas ligaments of un-cracked material in the crack wake are deemed to have less effect on the <b>crack</b> tip <b>loading</b> due to their low area fraction. The ligaments fail intergranularly in the wake as the crack grows in the present case, as opposed to by creep fracture as previously proposed.

A large amount of (SCC) stress corrosion cracking data accumulated at SNL and BNL for the WIPP program and by the Canadian Waste Management Program on titanium grades 2 and 12 indicates that there is no SCC at naturally occurring potentials in various brines. Hydride-induced cracking of titanium is a possibility and therefore, further investigation of this phenomenon under credible repository conditions is warranted.

Similar welds of each alloy and one dissimilar weld, IN 718 -IN 713, are studied in this project.

The crack propagation tests were conducted using a baseline cyclic triangular waveform with a frequency of 1 3 Hz. Various hold times were imposed at the maximum load of a fatigue cycle to study the hold time effect. The results show that a linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) parameter, stress intensity factor (K), is sufficient to describe the FCP and SLCG behavior at the testing temperatures ranging from 873 K to 1073 K (600 C to 800 C). As observed in the precipitation-strengthened superalloys, both INCONEL 617 and HAYNES 230 exhibited the time-dependent FCP, steady SLCG behavior, and existence of a damage zone ahead of crack tip. A thermodynamic equation was adapted to correlate the SLCG rates to determine thermal activation energy. The fracture modes associated with crack propagation behavior were discussed, and the mechanism of time-dependent FCP as well as SLCG was identified. Compared with INCONEL 617, the lower crack propagation rates of HAYNES 230 under the time-dependent condition were ascribed to the different fracture mode and the presence of numerous W-rich M 6 C-type and Cr-rich M 23 C 6 -type carbides. Toward the end, a phenomenological model was employed to correlate the FCP rates at cycle/time-dependent FCP domain.

However, without FRP lateral confinement, the interfacial bond strength and ductility would be weakened by <b>sustained</b> <b>load...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{relates to}} the behaviour of plain concrete specimens with a single crack subjected to a <b>sustained</b> shear <b>loading.</b> The <b>crack</b> plane is crossed perpendicularly by four steel bars having no bond with the concrete. These bars provide for the restraint stiffness of the crack. The normal stress on the crack plane is measured via strain gauges that have been axially attached to the bars. The variables of the tests were: the concrete grade; the initial crack width; the shear stress; the initial restraining stress normal to the crack plane; {{the diameter of the}} steel bars. Four static tests and eight sustained tests were performed. Experiments started at a concrete age of 28 days at 20 ° C and 50 % RH. The shear stress was applied in a load-controlled manner. The duration of the sustained tests was at least 90 days. Periodically the crack width and the shear slip of the opposing crack faces as well as the normal stress were measured. All the measuring data are presented in this report. The measured displacement-paths have been described by non-linear regression analysis. Moreover, the directly occurring and the time-dependent displacements were statistically determined as functions of the experimental variables. This approach is closely related to the mathematical method which is presented in Stevin-report 5 - 85 - 7 concerning push-off specimens with embedded reinforcing bars.

40|$|This study {{presents}} {{a series of}} 4 -point bending tests performed to describe the delayed behavior of unreinforced pre-cracked beams under low, moderate and high <b>sustained</b> <b>loading</b> levels. The deflection creep rate, the failure time and the load level were assessed. A linear relation, in a semi-log scale, was found for the deflection creep rate at high load levels. In addition, a linear relation, in a log-log scale, between the secondary deflection creep rate and failure time was observed. Besides, it was shown that the secondary creep deflection rate increases with the <b>sustained</b> <b>loading</b> level and the macrocrack propagation rate when macrocrack propagation occurs during the <b>sustained</b> <b>loading.</b> Physical mechanisms are proposed to explain these results and may be summarized as follows: the delayed behavior of an unreinforced cracked concrete specimen under <b>sustained</b> <b>loading</b> is mainly due to the cracking evolution, thus the creation of microcracks and/or the propagation of a macrocrack...|$|R
40|$|The dwell {{fatigue crack}} growth {{behaviour}} of coarse grained RR 1000 {{has been studied}} using advanced mechanical testing and characterization techniques. <b>Crack</b> growth under <b>sustained</b> <b>loading</b> has also been considered. Environmentally enhanced crack growth at high temperatures in air follows a stress assisted grain boundary oxidation (SAGBO) mechanism, with a 100 - 300 nm long Al 2 O 3 intrusion ahead of the crack tip. When its thickness of reaches a critical value, this intrusion fails and crack advance ensues. The crack growth process is discontinuous and highly uneven. The dwell fatigue/sustained <b>loading</b> <b>crack</b> growth rates {{are affected by the}} stress relaxation ability of the materials, which is related to the size and distribution of tertiary γ' precipitates, testing temperature and stress state. Oxidation damage is deduced to be a dominant factor affecting crack growth over a range of temperature from 600 to 700 °C. At 700 °C oxidation damage begins to have an effect on fatigue crack growth at a dwell time of 30 s. Creep damage is suggested to make the dominant contribution to crack growth at 750 and 775 °C both in air and in vacuum. ...|$|R
