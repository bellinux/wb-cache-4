40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the spatial}} distribution of <b>seat</b> <b>capacity</b> in the EU from 1990 to 2009 and sheds light on the contrasting results in the literature. It contributes to {{the debate on the}} deregulation and whether the rise of hub-and-spoke networks and the success of low-cost carriers lead to concentration or deconcentration. We use the Gini index and its decomposition to evaluate the contribution of airport subgroups and airline networks to the overall concentration of <b>seat</b> <b>capacity.</b> We conclude that, overall, <b>seat</b> <b>capacity</b> follows a spatial deconcentration pattern. While intra-EU <b>seat</b> <b>capacity</b> became more spatially deconcentrated, extra-EU <b>seat</b> <b>capacity</b> concentrated. However, our results do not support the general view that network carriers tend to increase concentration levels and low-cost carriers to decrease them, leading us to a reinterpretation of the impacts of air transport deregulation. The results show the increasing importance of foreign carriers and new strategies such as hub-bypassing...|$|R

5|$|The 747 {{line was}} further {{developed}} with {{the launch of}} the 747-300 in 1980. The 300 series resulted from Boeing studies to increase the <b>seating</b> <b>capacity</b> of the 747, during which modifications such as fuselage plugs and extending the upper deck over {{the entire length of the}} fuselage were rejected. The first 747-300, completed in 1983, included a stretched upper deck, increased cruise speed, and increased <b>seating</b> <b>capacity.</b> The -300 variant was previously designated 747SUD for stretched upper deck, then 747-200 SUD, followed by 747EUD, before the 747-300 designation was used. Passenger, short range and combination freighter-passenger versions of the 300 series were produced.|$|E

The result of the numerical study shows that the <b>seat</b> <b>capacity</b> allocation is effective even without information exchanging completely and the twofold revenue shares method shows more excitation for the airlines...|$|R
