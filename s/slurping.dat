Nolan and David S. Goyer had originally considered using Dent in Batman Begins, but they replaced him with the new character Rachel Dawes when they realized they [...] "couldn't do him justice." [...] Before Eckhart was cast in February 2007, Liev Schreiber, Josh Lucas, and Ryan Phillippe had expressed interest in the role, while Mark Ruffalo auditioned. Matt Damon stated that he was considered for the role, but could not accept due to scheduling conflicts. Hugh Jackman was also considered for the part. Nolan chose Eckhart, whom he had considered for the lead role in Memento, citing his [...] "extraordinary" [...] ability as an actor, his embodiment of [...] "that kind of chiselled, American hero quality" [...] projected by Robert Redford, and his subtextual [...] "edge." [...] Eckhart was [...] "interested in good guys gone wrong," [...] and had played corrupt men in films such as The Black Dahlia, Thank You for Smoking, and In the Company of Men. Whereas Two-Face is depicted as a crime boss in most characterizations, Nolan chose to portray him as a twisted vigilante to emphasize his role as Batman's counterpart. Eckhart explained, [...] " [...] is still true to himself. He's a crime fighter, he's not killing good people. He's not a bad guy, not purely." [...] For Dent, Eckhart [...] "kept on thinking about the Kennedys," [...] particularly Robert F. Kennedy, who was [...] "idealistic, held a grudge and took on the Mob." [...] He had his hair lightened and styled to make him appear more dashing. Nolan told Eckhart to not make Dent's Two-Face persona [...] "jokey with <b>slurping</b> sounds or ticks." ...|$|E

40|$|Mutations in <b>SLURP</b> 1 cause mal de Meleda, a rare palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK). <b>SLURP</b> 1 is a {{secreted}} {{protein that}} is expressed highly in keratinocytes but {{has also been}} identified elsewhere (e. g., spinal cord neurons). Here, we examined <b>Slurp</b> 1 -deficient mice (<b>Slurp</b> 1 −/-) created by replacing exon 2 with β-gal and neo cassettes. <b>Slurp</b> 1 −/- mice developed severe PPK characterized by increased keratinocyte proliferation, an accumulation of lipid droplets in the stratum corneum, and a water barrier defect. In addition, <b>Slurp</b> 1 −/- mice exhibited reduced adiposity, protection from obesity on a high-fat diet, low plasma lipid levels, and a neuromuscular abnormality (hind-limb clasping). Initially, {{it was unclear whether}} the metabolic and neuromuscular phenotypes were due to <b>Slurp</b> 1 deficiency, because we found that the targeted <b>Slurp</b> 1 mutation reduced the expression of several neighboring genes (e. g., <b>Slurp</b> 2, Lypd 2). We therefore created a new line of knockout mice (<b>Slurp</b> 1 X−/- mice) with a simple nonsense mutation in exon 2. The <b>Slurp</b> 1 X mutation did not reduce the expression of adjacent genes, but <b>Slurp</b> 1 X−/- mice exhibited all of the phenotypes observed in the original line of knockout mice.

2500|$|Female {{elephant}} seals forage in {{the open}} ocean, while male elephant seals forage along the continental shelf. [...] Males usually dive straight down to the ocean floor and stay at the bottom foraging for benthic prey. [...] The females hunt for pelagic prey {{in the open}} ocean, and dive deeper (up to 1000 m) and stay down longer than the males. [...] Northern elephant seals eat a variety of prey, including pelagic, deep-water squid, Pacific hake, pelagic crustaceans, sharks, rays, and ratfish. Octopoteuthis deletron squid are a common prey item, one study found this species in the stomachs of 58% of individuals sampled {{off the coast of}} California.

40|$|<b>SLURP</b> 1 is a {{secreted}} {{member of}} the LY 6 /PLAUR protein family. Mutations in the <b>SLURP</b> 1 gene are the cause of Mal de Meleda (MDM), a rare autosomal recessive genetic disease, characterized by inflammatory palmoplantar keratoderma. In this study, we have analyzed the expression of <b>SLURP</b> 1 in normal and MDM skin. <b>SLURP</b> 1 {{was found to be}} a marker of late differentiation, predominantly expressed in the granular layer of skin, notably the acrosyringium. Moreover, <b>SLURP</b> 1 was also identified in several biological fluids such as sweat, saliva, tears, and urine from normal volunteers. In palmoplantar sections from MDM patients, as well as in their sweat, mutant <b>SLURP</b> 1, including the new variant R 71 H-SLURP 1, was either absent or barely detectable. Transfected human embryonic kidney 293 T cells expressed the MDM mutant <b>SLURP</b> 1 containing the single amino-acid substitution G 86 R but did not tolerate the MDM mutation W 15 R located in the signal peptide. Thus, most MDM mutations in <b>SLURP</b> 1 affect either the expression, integrity, or stability of the protein, suggesting that a simple immunologic test {{could be used as a}} rapid screening procedure...|$|R
