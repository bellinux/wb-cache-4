Following {{the end of the war}} with Greece, the government decided to begin a naval reconstruction program. Asar-i Şevket and Necm-i Şevket proved to be in too poor a condition to merit rebuilding, and they were not included in the program. The former was decommissioned in 1903 and sold for scrap in 1909. Necm-i Şevket lingered on in service as a barracks ship until the outbreak of the First Balkan War in 1912. Bulgarian forces threatened to capture Constantinople, and so the Navy pressed the ship back into service to provide gunfire support to the Ottoman defenders. After the threat passed, she returned to barracks ship duties, a role <b>she</b> <b>filled</b> until 1929, when she was decommissioned after nearly sixty years in service.|$|E
