2500|$|The {{life cycle}} of F. magna is {{relatively}} complex and {{is similar to the}} development of the related fluke, F. hepatica. A detailed account of the F. magna life cycle was given by Swales (1935), Erhardová-Kotrlá (1971), and reviewed by Pybus (2001).Adult flukes occur in pairs or groups within a fibrous [...] in the liver parenchyma of the definitive host. Mature flukes release eggs which are collected in the cavity of the capsule. The capsule contains a great mass of eggs and has duct connections to bile ducts. The eggs are passed together with bile into the bile collecting <b>system,</b> <b>enter</b> the small intestine, and leave the definitive host along with the faeces. The eggs which are passed out in the faeces into the environment are undeveloped and undergo embryonation outside the host. Several physical-chemical factors, especially temperature, humidity and oxygen tension, are known to influence embryonation. During the embryonation of the egg, a larva called a miracidium develops from germinal cells. Fully developed miracidium releases the operculum of the egg using several proteases. The embryonation period varies from 27 to 44 days in natural conditions. Ciliated miracidia hatch in water and actively seek suitable intermediate hosts that are freshwater snails from family Lymnaeidae. After attaching to a suitable snail host, the miracidium penetrates into the snail body. After shedding its ciliated cell layer it is called a sporocyst. The sporocysts are found in the foot, the snail body, digestive glands, reproductive organs, and in the pulmonary sac of the snail. The sporocysts contain germinal cells that give rise to 1-6 mother rediae (a trematode larval form with an oral sucker). Developed mother rediae are released from the sporocyst and migrate into digestive glands, renal organ, reproductive organs, and pulmonary sac of the snail body. Each mother redia can asexually produce up to 10 daughter rediae. However, only 3 to 6 daughter rediae complete their development and leave the mother rediae. In turn, each daughter redia may produce 1-6 Trematode lifecycle stages#Typical lifecyle stagescercariae in experimentally infected snails and 16-22 cercariae under natural conditions. Cercariae emerge from the rediae and mature usually in digestive glands of the snail. Mature cercarie spontaneously emerge from the snail host and swim actively in water for up to two hours before encysting on vegetation. After encystment the flukes are called metacercariae. Development within the snail takes 40 to 69 days depending upon the temperature and the species of snail. The definitive host ingests vegetation containing the metacercariae. In the stomach and the intestine, the metacercariae are stimulated to emerge from the cyst (excystation). Newly excysted juvenile flukes penetrate the wall of the intestine and migrate in the abdominal cavity. Juvenile flukes penetrate the Glisson’s capsule of the liver and continue migrating in the liver tissue. Rarely juvenile flukes penetrate other organs, such as lungs or kidneys. In these organs, however, flukes do not survive and not attain maturity. In the liver, flukes migrate within the parenchyma to search another fluke. If the fluke meet another one, they stop moving, and the fibrous capsule is formed around them. In the capsule, the parasite completes its development and starts egg-laying. Prepatent period varies 3–7 months and is dependent on host species. Adult F. magna can survive in the liver of the host up to 7 years.|$|E

The main aim of the work is to use these stereotypical patterns as the basis of a system that can select appropriate strategies for interacting with the user, eliciting further information, and modifying the direction of a search session by assigning the user's information need and the intermediate search successes and failures to the appropriate abstract cate [...] ...|$|E

Simulated sample paths on the three generators’ terminal voltage and current waveforms, rotor angles, and angular speed deviations are displayed that contain consecutive durations at normal, fault-on, protection false trip, and post-fault operations. The system starts with a normal operation. A mid-point short to ground fault in line 5 - 7 occurs at 0.3 s. into the simulation. Line 7 - 8 is falsely removed at 0.4 s., which renders the <b>system</b> <b>enter</b> insecure state m. The fault is cleared at 0.5 s. by reconnecting line 7 - 8 and removing line 5 - 7. The recovered system enters and stays at state d (post-fault) from 0.5 s. {{till the end of}} the simulation. The electro-mechanical states of the three generators are estimated based on the measurement model in (13). The estimates are obtained using the local PMU-like sensor input waveforms at 24 samples/cycle at the high side terminals of the step up transformer of a generator. The estimation algorithm does not involve any swing dynamics.|$|E

Actually, the problem is the adjustment certain input control of nonlinear plant so the variable state system reaches the equilibrium point.

By defining an area of certain surface, many researchers succeed in using this sliding mode method to determine adjustment certain input control for both linear and nonlinear systems. The main disadvantage of controller of this method is the chattering effect caused by forcement of system to enter the area or sliding surface. This research is to develop a controller synthesis method of new sliding mode in order to produce or to determine adjustment input control by deleting or smoothing chattering effect without decreasing the performance. Replacing the sign function by tan inverse function may deleting or smoothing chattering effect. It is done by ordering the system parameters by considering stability aspects and uncertainty of the system.
