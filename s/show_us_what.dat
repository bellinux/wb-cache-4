500|$|Close-Up, for example, {{contains}} {{scenes from}} the real-life trial of a man charged with fraudulently impersonating a film director. To make the film, however, Kiarostami coaxed the antagonists to re-stage scenes occurring between them, including the arrest. While such a technique clearly precludes labeling the film as a documentary, by re-staging events between the deceiver and the deceived Kiarostami implicitly poses questions about the validity and significance of what the audience sees. Because these are the actual participants in a drama played out in criminal court, it dawns on the audience that these re-stagings {{are also part of}} the real life of these people, especially since both the impersonator and the family he fooled were interested in working in cinema. If these re-enactments constitute a kind of [...] "evidence", this is less because they <b>show</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> took place to cause the arrest than because the audience is witness to a scene in which the actors are in fact continuing the story of their confrontation and/or reconciliation.|$|E
500|$|David Sims of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} a 'B-', stating [...] "I've defended this show against {{complaints}} that it’s terminally bland, but formulaic material like this really does expose its flaws. It’s definitely not an unwatchably bad show ... In short: don’t be shy, Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. <b>Show</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> you can do." [...] He did praise the visual {{effects in the}} episode though, saying, [...] "This week’s episode {{had a couple of}} very nicely-staged set pieces and, especially for broadcast TV, some excellent special effects. Fire is hard to pull off, even in a blockbuster movie, but this episode revolved around a character ... who can generate and manipulate fire, and everything he did looked pretty cool." [...] Morgan Jeffrey at Digital Spy scored the episode 3 stars out of 5, calling it a [...] "slow burn", and concluding that [...] "Skye's arc is easily the weakest aspect of [...] "Girl in the Flower Dress" [...] but there's a decent villain and a strong climax to help compensate." [...] Will Salmon of SFX also scored the episode 3 stars out of 5, stating [...] "a shade more mature than the initial installments. It’s a welcome growth, and it does feel like Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. is getting itself together. They found the right levels of warmth and humanity last week, and humour and drama this time around. Now they just need to start going on some genuinely compelling missions against decent enemies." [...] Jim Steranko, known for his work on Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., felt the series [...] "has settled into a pragmatic, if sometimes predictable comfort zone", and said that the episode [...] "delivered enough premise, pace, and patter to get its audience through a mellow hour — and set the bar higher {{for the rest of the}} season." ...|$|E
2500|$|He paints, {{or rather}} regards, {{things in a}} way that is {{different}} from that of other artists. He sees only the essential, and that, naturally, is all he paints. For this reason Munch's pictures are as a rule [...] "not complete", as people are so delighted to discover for themselves. Oh, yes, they are complete. His complete handiwork. Art is complete once the artist has really said everything that was on his mind, and this is precisely the advantage Munch has over painters of the other generation, that he really knows how to <b>show</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> he has felt, and what has gripped him, and to this he subordinates everything else.|$|E

5000|$|Sir Joseph Banks said of him: [...] "Others have <b>shown</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> {{they thought}} these remains {{ought to have}} been, but Fowler has <b>shown</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> they are, {{and that is what}} we want." [...] According to the Dictionary of National Biography his works are {{distinguished}} by a strict fidelity especially remarkable at the time. Whenever it was possible he worked from tracings, rubbings, etc. It is claimed that he was the first to introduce the lead-lines in representations of painted glass. There is a characteristic portrait of him by W. Bond, from a painting by George Francis Joseph, A.R.A., dated 4 June 1810.|$|R
2500|$|In {{a review}} from Rickey.org, Nick Roman said, [...] "All in all, while “Broken Heart” had its shortcomings, I {{thought it was}} a fun episode for Once Upon a Time. Everyone has their {{memories}} back, and we’re right at the point the season started. So, presumably, we won’t be getting any more flashbacks. Rather, the story will move forward, hopefully, and show us just how the Darkness and the Light will clash. Knowing Once Upon a Time, there will probably be some sort of compromise, but I think it’d be bold if the show snuffed out one or the other, just to <b>show</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> a world without Light, or a world without plot-driving evil, looks like." ...|$|E

5000|$|Admired for its uncompromising realism, The Gross Clinic has an {{important}} place documenting the history of medicine—both because it honors the emergence of surgery as a healing profession (previously, surgery was associated primarily with amputation), and because it <b>shows</b> <b>us</b> <b>what</b> the surgical theater looked like in the nineteenth century.|$|R
