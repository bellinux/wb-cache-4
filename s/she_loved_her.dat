5|$|Meyer {{was born}} Selina Catherine Eaton to mother Catherine Calvert Eaton and Gordon Dunn Eaton. In her childhood, <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>her</b> father (whom she affectionately called Daddy), but resented her narcissistic mother. It is later {{revealed}} that Selina's {{father was an}} adulterer who died {{from a heart attack}} while having sex with his secretary, and that her mother only stayed with him to provide for her. Selina attended Smith College, and Yale Law School. As a young woman, she married Andrew Meyer, a shady real estate developer, with whom she has a daughter, Catherine. She eventually divorces Andrew for repeatedly cheating on her, and shows little (if any) maternal instinct towards her daughter.|$|E

25|$|In 1738, Montagu {{wrote to}} Harley {{explaining}} {{that she had}} no desire for men or marriage. She saw marriage as a rational and expedient convention and did not suppose it possible to love a man. In 1742 she married Edward Montagu, grandson of the Edward Montagu, 1st Earl of Sandwich, who owned numerous coal mines and had several rents and estates in Northumberland. She was twenty-two and he was fifty years old. The marriage was advantageous, but it was apparently not very passionate. All the same, she bore a son, John, the next year, and <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>her</b> child immensely. When he died unexpectedly in 1744, she was devastated. She and Edward remained friendly throughout their remaining time together, but there were no more children or pregnancies. Prior to the loss of her son, she had not been very religious, but his death brought her to consider religion more and more. Meanwhile, her sister, Sarah Scott, was growing increasingly devout.|$|E

500|$|Contact often {{suggests}} that cultural conflicts {{between religion and}} science would {{be brought to the}} fore by the apparent contact with aliens that occurs in the film. A [...] point of discussion is the existence of God, with several different positions being portrayed. A description of an emotionally intense experience by Palmer Joss, which he describes as seeing God, is met by Arroway's suggestion that [...] "some part of [...] needed to have it"—that it was a significant personal experience but indicative of nothing greater. Joss compares his certainty that God exists to Arroway's certainty that <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>her</b> deceased father, despite her being unable to prove it.|$|E
500|$|Outhwaite {{had long}} {{been a fan of}} Inside No. 9 and the work of Pemberton and Shearsmith, the former of whom she had worked with in an episode of Hotel Babylon. She was {{particularly}} pleased to appear alongside Hadland, as the pair are old friends, and characterised her duet with Hadland as her favourite scene. Outhwaite, like some of the other performers, expressed her enjoyment of the fancy dress aspect of the episode, and <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>her</b> [...] "selfish, sad and manipulative" [...] character, Connie. The filming process was, for her, extremely enjoyable and memorable. Pemberton said that Hadland and Outhwaite [...] "brought a bubbly energy which injected into the hysteria of that room", naming the episode's production his favourite filming experience from the series. Shearsmith pointed to the scene in which [...] "a hen party invades the karaoke room and they start singing. The music was pumped up and we had a mini party, with mad dancing – that was a memorable scene to film." ...|$|E

On June 27, 1994, 26-year-old Smith and 89-year-old Marshall were married in Houston. This resulted in a great deal of gossip about her marrying him for his money.

Smith, however, maintained that <b>she</b> <b>loved</b> <b>her</b> husband, and age did not matter to her.
