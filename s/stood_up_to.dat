Maurice Vincent became a pilot and served in the Royal Air Force (RAF) until he retired through illness in 1933. He died of colitis the following year, leaving a widow and small daughter.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{exploited}} the accident {{to undermine the}} IK-1 concept, with Bajdak joining those criticising the aircraft. The three flights were not considered sufficient to give a verdict on the design, and the debate over its future was fierce. This placed significant pressure on the designers, as every element of the aircraft design was subsequently attacked. Eventually, it was generally agreed that the aircraft was well-designed, but it needed more testing. At this point, Ikarus decided to build a second prototype, as {{it was evident that}} the hand-sewn fabric seam on the wing had not <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the strain of aerobatics, and their workmanship was in question. The second prototype took 10 months to build, with the two designers closely involved.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} at Cambridge Vaughan Williams {{continued}} his weekly lessons with Parry, and studied composition with Charles Wood and organ with Alan Gray. He graduated as Bachelor of Music in 1894 and Bachelor of Arts the following year. After leaving the university he returned to complete his training at the RCM. Parry had by then succeeded Sir George Grove {{as director of the}} college, and Vaughan Williams's new professor of composition was Charles Villiers Stanford. Relations between teacher and student were stormy. Stanford, who had been adventurous in his younger days, had grown deeply conservative; he clashed vigorously with his modern-minded pupil. Vaughan Williams had no wish to follow in the traditions of Stanford's idols, Brahms and Wagner, and he <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> his teacher as few students dared to do. Beneath Stanford's bluster lay a recognition of Vaughan Williams's talent and a desire to help the young man correct his opaque orchestration and extreme predilection for modal music.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, most of {{the women}} and {{children}} had gathered in the sacristy of the church. As Mexican soldiers entered the room, a boy, thought to be the son of defender Anthony Wolf, <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> rearrange a blanket around his shoulders. Mistaking him for a Texian soldier, the Mexican soldiers bayoneted him. In the confusion, {{at least one of the}} women was lightly wounded. Bowie's family, including Gertrudis Navarro, Juana Navarro Alsbury and her son, were hiding in one of the rooms along the west wall. Navarro opened the door to their room to signal that they meant no harm. A Mexican officer soon arrived and led the women to a spot along one of the walls where they would be relatively safe. All of the women and children were eventually placed under the protection of an officer and escorted out of the Alamo and imprisoned in the home of the Musquiz family.|$|E
5|$|Ninety {{seconds after}} Wallace shoved Artest, most of both teams' {{players and coaches}} were huddled at midcourt, {{attempting}} to calm down Wallace (Tayshaun Prince was the only player on either team to not leave the bench during the entire incident; others became automatically eligible for one-game suspensions). While Artest {{was lying on the}} table, Wallace threw a towel at him, causing Artest to briefly stand up before being held back by coaches. A spectator, John Green, then threw a plastic cup of Diet Coke at Artest, hitting him in the chest. Artest jumped off the table, ran into the stands, and grabbed a man, Michael Ryan, who he mistakenly believed was responsible. Boyle <b>stood</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> try and hold back Artest and was trampled in the effort, suffering five fractured vertebrae and a gouge on his head. Jackson followed Artest into the stands and punched a fan, William Paulson, in the face in retaliation for the man throwing another drink in Artest's face while he was being restrained by other spectators. Pacers players Eddie Gill, David Harrison, Reggie Miller (who was not dressed for the game due to injury), Fred Jones, and Jamaal Tinsley, the Pistons' Rasheed Wallace, and numerous personnel (including Pistons radio analyst and former player Rick Mahorn) also quickly entered the stands to retrieve Artest and Jackson, and to break up the fighting. Green punched Artest twice in the head from behind, as did Ben Wallace's brother, David, to Jones. More fans then began throwing drinks and other objects, while a number of fans spilled out onto the court.|$|E

Let this teach us <b>to</b> <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> plead for him before men, to plead for him against the enemies of his person and gospel. This is but reasonable; for if Christ <b>stands</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> plead for us, why should not we <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> plead for him? He also expects this at our hands, saying, [...] "Who will rise up for me against the evil doers? Who will <b>stand</b> <b>up</b> for me against the workers of iniquity?" [...] (Psa 94:16). The apostle did it, and counted himself engaged to do it, where he saith, he preached [...] "the gospel of God with much contention" [...] (I Thess 2:2). Nor is this the duty of apostles or preachers only, but every child of God should [...] "earnestly contend for the faith which was once {{delivered}} unto the saints" [...] (Jude 3).|$|R

Browne further alienated the middle ground in 1986 with the publishing of his autobiography Against the Tide. Historians like Dr. Ruth Barrington, who had written extensively about Irish health policy and had access to the files from the 1940s and 1950s, questioned the book's reliability.|$|E

Arrangements were made with the oxygen-producing plant in Manila, which supplied the U.S. Navy's shipyard at Cavite, to buy any surplus for pursuit units, but output was so small that only the squadron at Nichols (which reopened on 17 October) could be supplied, and on a limited basis.|$|E
