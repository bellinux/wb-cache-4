40|$|This study {{discusses}} the phases involved {{for the development}} of OER-based course materials namely the OER course integration using Wikibooks; evaluation of Quality Assurance (QA) in OER learning content; promoting and exploring OER repositories; CC licensing discussions and establishment of collective feedback sessions at Wawasan Open University (WOU), Penang, Malaysia. The learning design for the computing courses with engagement of learning experiences and feedbacks from different stake-holders in Open Distance Learning (ODL) environment are taken into consideration as one of the major components in the OER-based course development and revision phases. The OER-based computing course comprises of course units, <b>self-test,</b> <b>unit</b> practice exercises, assessments, mini project and activities are delivered in ODL mode in three consecutive semesters span from 2013 till 2014. Evaluations and studies are being carried out at end of each semesters for the by the course team members on the primary aspects focusing on learners ’ participation rate of OER resources; LMS learners ’ activities and assessments evaluation. The OER development engagement involved multiple stakeholders (i. e. learners, instructors, course coordinators and External Course Assessors) from different levels aiming to promote the use and understanding of OER in ODL environment...|$|E
40|$|We {{define a}} new class of {{parallel}} counters, Saturating Counters, which provide the exact count of the inputs that are 1 only if this count is below a given threshold. Such counters are useful in, for example, a <b>self-test</b> and repair <b>unit</b> for embedded memories in a system-on-a-chip. We describe this application and present several alternatives for the design of the saturating counter. We then compare the delay and area of the proposed design alternatives. 1...|$|R
40|$|On modem {{semiconductor}} assemblies, it {{is becoming}} increasingly common to include a built-in <b>self-test</b> (BIST) <b>unit</b> in the design which can be used to help test the assembly during manufacturing. Unfortunately, these BIST routines often provide only minimal fail data. With increasing speeds, shrinking die, and a shift to fine ball grid array (FBGA) leads on devices, replacement of faulty semiconductor chips is becoming more difficult, and therefore more costly. When incomplete test data does not clearly show which component is faulty, even more cost stands to be added if a non- faulty device is replaced first. Current best-guess fault diagnosis is likely performed with a rules-based approach which can be time-consuming and difficult to maintain. This thesis will show that an Artificial Neural Network implemented in VHDL, using Backpropagation methods for training, can correctly diagnose most-likely failing components based on historical fault data while providing several advantages over a rules-based approach in the form of adaptability, scalability, and generality...|$|R
40|$|Saturating {{counters}} are a newly defined {{class of}} generalized parallel counters {{that provide the}} exact number of inputs which are equal to 1 only if this number is below a given threshold. Such counters are useful in, for example, <b>self-test</b> and repair <b>units</b> for embedded memories. This paper defines saturating counters for arbitrary threshold values and presents several alternatives for their implementation. The delay and area of the proposed design alternatives are then estimated using a 0. 25 µm cell library. Finally, we study the behavior of saturating counters when the threshold approaches the number of input bits, i. e., the special case of non-saturating parallel counters. 1...|$|R
40|$|Variability {{of process}} {{parameters}} in nanometer CMOS circuits makes standard worst-case design methodology waste {{much of the}} advantages ofscaling. A common-case design, though, is a perilous alternative, as it gives up much of the design yield. Better than worst-case (BTWC) design methodology reconciles performance and yield. In this paper we present a BTWC RISC processor that tolerates worst-case extra delays of critical paths without {{significant impact on the}} overall performance. We obtain this result by coupling latency-insensitive design and variable-latency (VL) units. A software built-in <b>self-test</b> checks VL <b>units</b> individually to determine whether to activate them or not. Compared to a worst-case approach, the RISC clock frequency increases by 23 % in a 45 nm CMOS technology. The impactof VL on instructions per cycle is circumscribed to the worst process case only and very limited, as we show through a set of benchmark...|$|R
