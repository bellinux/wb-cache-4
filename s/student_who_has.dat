The learning model compared were TPS, TTW, and TSTS. The type of the research was a quasi-experimental research. The population were all of the students in grade 8 th of Junior High School in Sleman regency. Sampling was done by stratified cluster random sampling. The samples were students of SMPN 1 Kalasan, SMPN 4 Kalasan, and SMPN 2 Ngemplak. The instruments used were mathematics achievement tests and self-efficacy questionnaire. The data was analyzed by using unbalanced two-ways Anova. The conclusions were as follows. (1) TPS gives better mathematics achievement than TTW, and both gives better mathematics achievement than TSTS.

Tami is faced with a struggle as the principal of West Dillon. A new character on the show, Becky, is introduced when Tim Riggins rents a trailer on her mother's property. Although she is in love with Tim, she and Luke are both shopping at a convenience store and she allows Luke to drive her home. The two have sex and Becky becomes pregnant. Even though she is a student at East Dillon, she seeks out Tami's help with the situation. Tami discusses all of the options with her and Becky decides to get an abortion. Her mother goes with her to the procedure. Parents find out about this and led by Luke's mother, seek Mrs. Taylor's dismissal as principal. When Tami refuses to apologize, as she followed procedure, she is put on leave. She decides to return to her role as a guidance counselor, but at East Dillon.|$|E
5|$|The film {{focuses on}} Jack Goodwin, a young {{chemistry}} <b>student</b> <b>who</b> <b>has</b> discovered a novel compound {{that allows a}} person {{to be put in}} a state of sleep for any length of time. The compound causes an effect similar to suspended animation, with no ill-effects or bodily changes. Jack tests the compound on himself for a period of a week and desires to test it for a century. In preparation for this, he obtains a safety deposit vault and provides instructions to be presented before the mayor in a hundred years. Jack's experiment works and he awakes in the year 2010 to a very different future. Transportation has been radically changed to pneumatic tubes allowing him to be transported to the mayor. The woman mayor takes an interest in him and invites her over to her home. In the intervening years, the world has become ruled by women and Jack is now out of place, but the two fall in love. Her father is an advocate for men's rights and Jack joins their society. The group soon appears before the mayor and she sends all of them to jail through the pneumatic tube, except for Jack. She proposes to him, but Jack only consents if the rights of men would be granted. The mayor is true to her word and signs a decree to give the men their liberty. During the ceremony, she attempts to lead Jack to the altar, but Jack shows her that the man must lead. When the bridal veil is placed on Jack, he places it on his new wife.|$|E

First, the average mark in Principles of Finance for all <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> completed Business Statistics was compared to the average mark of all <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not completed Business Statistics. Second, the average pass mark for all students in Principles of Finance <b>who</b> <b>had</b> passed Business Statistics was compared to the average pass mark of all <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not passed Business Statistics. Third, the average pass mark for <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> been granted exemption from Business Statistics, based on prior learning, was compared to the average pass mark of <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> passed Business Statistics.

Analysis of the pretest data showed that there were no significant differences among the three groups on age, sex, religion, father’s education, father’s occupation, participation in class, birth position, grade average, relationships with others, help-seeking behaviour, level of assertiveness, the proportion having career goals or attitude toward marriage and woman’s role. The control group had a significantly higher level of self-esteem at pretest. At posttest, this significant difference had disappeared. We also found that there had been a significant increase in the proportion of comparison group respondents who felt that trial marriages was acceptable for others. The experimental group, at posttest, showed a significant increase in help-seeking behaviour with siblings. There were also two significant findings which were in the opposite direction to that hypothesized. The control group showed a significantly less traditional attitude toward marriage and woman’s role on two counts; there was a significant increase in the number of control group respondents who were undecided about having children, and there was a significant increase in the percentage <b>who</b> <b>had</b> a positive attitude toward trial marriage for themselves. Only one of the hypotheses predicting greater effectiveness for the innovative teaching method was supported; that <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> taken the innovatively taught family life education program would be more likely to seek help from siblings with their personal problems. The traditionally taught family life educationa program proved significantly more effective in increasing the proportion of <b>students</b> <b>who</b> found trial marriage acceptable for others. These findings give tentative support ot the proposition that the family life education program at Sir John A. Macdonald High School in Hamilton, Ontario meeting its stated objectives, as outlined in the text. They also suggest that the traditional teaching method and the innovative roleplaying method are equally effective with this particular course material and these particular teachers...|$|R
40|$|Using {{a sample}} of 446 {{secondary}} <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> participated in a vocational education and training in school (VETiS) program, compares the experiences and perceptions of <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> undertaken a work placement with those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not. Shows that <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> participated in work placement enjoyed the VETiS experience more than those <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not, and that the work placement had assisted them in their decision whether to stay at school or not. A factor analysis of results showed a factor associated with self-confidence about employability, and a factor associated with assistance in achieving specific post-school employment. <b>Students</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> completed a work placement were significantly higher on both these factors than <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> not. Results are consistent with other research in the field, and {{it is argued that}} the work placement experience plays a considerable part in developing student agency in the decisions and the journey that they make in their transition from school to work. <br /...|$|R
