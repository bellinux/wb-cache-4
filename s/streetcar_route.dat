5|$|Chester {{station is}} served by the Bloor-Danforth line which {{operates}} between Kennedy and Kipling stations. The station {{was designed to be}} serviced with side platforms as it mainly serves the surrounding neighbourhood. As it is the only station in the system that is not connected to a regular bus or <b>streetcar</b> <b>route</b> {{it is one of the}} least used subway stations in Toronto. The 300 Bloor-Danforth Night Bus operates on Danforth from 1:30-5:30 a.m. after the line is shut down for nightly maintenance.|$|E

25|$|On June 19, 2016, the TTC {{launched}} a new <b>streetcar</b> <b>route</b> operating (alongside route 504 King) along King Street between Dufferin and Sumach streets, dubbed the 514 Cherry. The route operates every 15 minutes or better, and uses the Commission's new accessible Flexity streetcars. The eastern end of the new route runs over the Cherry Street streetcar line, a branch constructed starting in 2012 and running on a reserved side-of-street right-of-way.|$|E
25|$|Changes to {{the transit}} service through Jamaica Plain were {{followed}} with a change to the <b>streetcar</b> <b>route</b> as well. The Arborway line, which had been in service since 1903, had long been considered for replacement with bus service by the transportation authority. In 1977, trolley service on the Arborway line from downtown Boston was stopped at Heath Street, with buses continuing to Forest Hills. Service resumed, but were cut again in the 1980s, {{and has not been}} resumed since. This decision has been challenged by citizen groups in Jamaica Plain in the courts, and is still in dispute.|$|E

25|$|On December 12, 2012, {{a ballot}} {{initiative}} {{to construct a}} $102 million, 2-mile (3200 m) modern streetcar line in downtown Kansas City was approved by local voters. The <b>streetcar</b> <b>route</b> runs along Main Street from the River Market to Union Station; it debuted on May 6, 2016. A new non-profit corporation made up of private sector stakeholders and city appointees – the Kansas City Streetcar Authority – operates and maintains the system. Unlike many similar systems around the U.S., no fare is to be charged initially. Residents within the proposed Transportation Development District are determining {{the fate of the}} KC Streetcar's southern extension through Midtown and the Plaza to UMKC. The Port Authority of Kansas City is also studying running an extension to Berkley Riverfront Park.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} {{discontinued}} use of street rail occurred on Grand River on May 5, 1947 to alleviate rush hour congestion, which was alleviated further {{with the addition}} of two center lanes which were reserved for downtown-bound traffic during the morning and in the other direction in the evening. On September 15, 1949, the Crosstown (Warren Avenue) was converted experimentally into trolleybus service from Saint Jean Street to the Pierson Loop, although from 1955 to 1959 it operated to Ann Arbor Trail. Trolleybus service on the Crosstown line ended on March 31, 1961. The Grand River line was also converted experimentally to trolleybus operation partially in July 1951 and completely on September 5, 1951 and operated until November 16, 1962, when the vehicles were replaced by diesel buses. The General Manager of the DSR, Leo J. Nowicki, justified discontinued use of rail on Jefferson in January 1954, citing that the cost of replacing worn-out track and maintaining overhead wires would cost around $1,647,500 while the cost of purchasing 40 new 51-passenger diesel buses would only be around $800,000. On September 5, 1951, the Jefferson Carhouse closed, which resulted in the transferring of the Jefferson PCCs to the Gratiot Carhouse. Then on February 7 the Jefferson line was replaced by buses while the PCCs that operated the Jefferson line were used as backup cars for the remaining three lines. Then on September 8, 1954 the Gratiot Carhouse closed and the remaining PCC cars were transferred to the Woodward and Wyoming carhouses, resulting in Gratiot-assigned cars being forced to deadhead along Woodward followed by the Michigan portion of the Michigan-Gratiot line on September 7, 1955 and the closure of the Wyoming Carhouse on the same day, resulting in the PCCs being transferred to the Woodward Carhouse, resulting in the construction of two temporary tracks across Second Avenue into the Highland Park Shops. By 1956 only the Gratiot and Woodward line remained. On September 12, 1955, the Detroit Street Railway Commission approved the replacement of Detroit's last <b>streetcar</b> <b>route</b> for the spring of 1956. The commission argued that replacing streetcars with buses would allow more flexibility in route scheduling; eliminate mid-street loading zones and allow curbside passenger pick-up, increasing safety; and reduce operating cost.|$|E
2500|$|Originally, {{the route}} ran in a {{dedicated}} right-of-way. [...] The route {{was transferred to}} the Toronto Transportation Commission upon its creation in 1921, which removed the dedicated right of way in 1928. It is the northernmost <b>streetcar</b> <b>route</b> still in operation, and was the first to make an underground connection with the subway at St. Clair West Station. It formerly continued beyond St. Clair Station and up Mount Pleasant Road to Eglinton Avenue, but this portion was later made a separate route that was subsequently converted to bus operation in the 1970s.|$|E

2500|$|The Toronto {{streetcar}} {{system is}} a network of eleven streetcar routes in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, operated by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC). It is both the largest and busiest light-rail system in North America {{as well as the}} largest tramway in the Americas in terms of ridership, number of cars, and track length. The network is concentrated primarily in Downtown Toronto and in proximity to the city's waterfront. Much of the <b>streetcar</b> <b>route</b> network dates from the 19th century. Most of Toronto's streetcar routes operate on street trackage shared with vehicular traffic, and streetcars stop on demand at frequent stops like buses.|$|E

The remaining [...] of round-trip route length are sections where the NS <b>streetcar</b> <b>route</b> uses a single street (or private right-of-way) for both directions of travel. The CL Line, similarly, follows separate streets in opposite directions over most of its length. The only exceptions are a length of about [...] near the OMSI terminus (mostly on a streetcar-only viaduct over the Union Pacific Railroad main line) and the route sections nearest to, and across, the Broadway Bridge.

2500|$|The Q85 {{begins at}} Bay B of the Jamaica Center Bus Terminal, running down Merrick Boulevard to Baisley Boulevard and 120th Avenue in St. Albans. It then runs down Baisley Boulevard, Bedell Street (adjacent to {{the tracks of}} the Long Island Rail Road's Montauk Branch near Rochdale Village), and 140th Avenue to Springfield Boulevard. The route then turns south along Springfield Boulevard to Conduit Avenue, then east along Conduit Avenue, along the former Brooklyn-Freeport Line <b>streetcar</b> <b>route.</b> At Francis Lewis Boulevard near the Rosedale LIRR station, the Q85 splits into two branches. The {{full-time}} Rosedale branch turns south along 243rd Street and terminates {{at the intersection of}} 147th Avenue and Huxley Street, with a transfer to the [...] to continue farther east along 147th Avenue.

2500|$|Around this time, many {{streetcar}} {{lines in}} Queens {{and the rest}} of the city began to be replaced by buses, particularly after the unification of city's three primary transit companies in June 1940. On April 21, 1931, Jamaica Central created a subsidiary known as Jamaica Buses, Inc. to convert its trolley lines to bus franchises. The Rockaway-Nassau portion of the Far Rockaway route began operating as a bus line (without a franchise) in September 1930, with the streetcar line between Jamaica and the county line continuing to operate. On November 12, 1933 the full route began operations as a single bus line. The Jamaica-Far Rockaway service would become [...] "Route B". Due to the length of the route, it originally operated on a two-zone (then-ten cent) fare, as did the <b>streetcar</b> <b>route</b> before it. Additional buses were run between Jamaica and Baisley Boulevard at the Jamaica Racetrack. Beginning on June 15, 1935, during summer months (June to September) the route was extended south from Far Rockaway station to Seagirt Avenue (now Seagirt Boulevard) to serve Ostend Beach, Roche Beach, and other beaches on the southern coast of the Rockaway peninsula. The northern terminal was moved from Jamaica Avenue to the Parsons Boulevard station of the IND Queens Boulevard Line on Hillside Avenue on April 24, 1937. On October 10, 1938, overnight service was initiated on the route, running between Jamaica and either Farmers Boulevard or the Nassau County line at Hook Creek.|$|E
