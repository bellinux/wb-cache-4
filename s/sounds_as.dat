5|$|Karlheinz Stockhausen {{employed}} {{noise in}} vocal compositions, such as Momente (1962–64/69), {{in which the}} four choirs clap their hands, talk, and shuffle their feet, in order to mediate between instrumental and vocal <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> well as to incorporate sounds normally made by audiences into those produced by the performers.|$|E
5|$|Several {{anti-noise}} {{and electric}} car advocates have opposed {{the introduction of}} artificial <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> warning for pedestrians, as {{they argue that the}} proposed system will only increase noise pollution. They also opposed U.S. pending legislation that would require generated warning sounds with no off switch for the driver.|$|E
5|$|The team fielded in 1980 was {{recognized}} as one of the 100greatest minor league teams of all time. The 2006 team tied the record for the longest game in PCL history (24innings). Of the three nine-inning perfect games in the history of the PCL, two have been pitched by members of the Sounds. In 2016, Forbes listed the <b>Sounds</b> <b>as</b> the 19th-most valuable Minor League Baseball team with a value of $30.5 million.|$|E

5|$|Moving {{from the}} PlayStation Portable to the PlayStation 3 allowed the {{development}} team {{to add more}} details to the character designs, additional atmospheric <b>sounds,</b> <b>as</b> well as slightly tweak the gameplay system, now allowing camera control with the right analog stick. In addition, the Mirage Arena (a multiplayer component from the original game) has been reworked to only be a single-player experience. Yasue said enemy strengths and AI in the arena were adjusted to account for this. The inclusion of the Final Mix version in the collection {{marked the first time}} for this version to be released outside Japan.|$|E
5|$|On October 27, 1998, Rhino Entertainment {{issued a}} four-disc box set {{entitled}} The Complete Country & Western Recordings: 1959–1986, which chronicles Charles's {{country and western}} recordings. The collection features the two volumes of Modern <b>Sounds,</b> <b>as</b> well as his later country singles for Warner Bros. Included in the set is a hardcover booklet of essays by producer Sid Feller, writer Daniel Cooper, and Ray Charles, along with liner photography by Howard Morehead and Les Leverett. On June 2, 2009, both volumes of Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music were reissued as a single package by Concord Music. The reissue was also included as a download in the iTunes Store.|$|E
5|$|Predators may {{identify}} their prey by sound {{as well as}} sight; mimics have accordingly evolved to deceive the hearing of their predators. Bats are nocturnal predators that rely on echolocation to detect their prey. Some potential prey are unpalatable to bats, and produce an ultrasonic aposematic signal, the auditory equivalent of warning coloration. In response to echolocating red bats and big brown bats, tiger moths such as Cycnia tenera produce warning sounds. Bats learn to avoid the harmful moths, but similarly avoid other species such as some pyralid moths that produce such warning <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> well. Acoustic mimicry complexes, both Batesian and Müllerian, may be widespread in the auditory world.|$|E
50|$|Rattles may be {{the primary}} cause of the instrument's <b>sound,</b> <b>as</b> in the maraca, or they may modify its <b>sound,</b> <b>as</b> in the sizzle cymbal, or they may be used for both {{purposes}} depending on how it is played, as in the tambourine.|$|R
5000|$|Srini cites bands such as The Clean, The Folk Implosion, Wire and Guided by Voices as influences. [...] Jacques Wait {{described}} the band's <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> [...] "dance-y, garage-y indie rock that kicks ass {{but is also}} fun" [...] Journalist David Hansen {{described the}} <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> [...] "jagged-edged pop-rock".|$|R
5000|$|Portions of the Vedantic {{literature}} {{elucidate the}} use of <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> a spiritual tool. They assert that the entire cosmic creation began with sound: [...] "By His utterance came the universe." [...] (Brihadaranyaka Upanishad 1.2.4). The Vedanta-sutras add that ultimate liberation comes from <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> well (anavrittih shabdat).|$|R
5|$|The {{soundtrack of}} Solaris {{features}} Johann Sebastian Bach's chorale prelude for organ, Ich ruf' zu dir, Herr Jesu Christ, BWV 639, played by Leonid Roizman, and an electronic score by Eduard Artemyev. The prelude {{is the central}} musical theme of Solaris. Tarkovsky initially wanted the film to be devoid of music and asked composer Artemyev to orchestrate ambient <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> a musical score. The latter proposed subtly introducing orchestral music. In counterpoint to classical music as Earth's theme is fluid electronic music as the theme for the planet Solaris. The character of Hari has her own subtheme, a cantus firmus based upon J. S. Bach's music featuring Artemyev's composition atop it; it is heard at Hari's death and at story's end.|$|E
5|$|Larry Schmittou had {{originally}} been encouraged by the New York Yankees organization to establish the <b>Sounds</b> <b>as</b> a Triple-A team, {{but he refused to}} go back on his previous promise to partner with the Reds at Double-A. After the split with Cincinnati, the Sounds made their first affiliation switch in 1980, becoming the Double-A affiliate of the Yankees. Under manager Stump Merrill, the 1980 Sounds finished {{the first half of the}} season one-and-a-half games behind the Memphis Chicks. In the second half, the team finished in first place, 14 games ahead of the second-place Montgomery Rebels. In the Western Division championship series, Nashville lost to Memphis, three games to one. Nine Southern League records were set during the season, the team's pitching staff led the league in ERA and strikeouts, and Steve Balboni, the league MVP, led the league with 101runs, 34home runs, 122RBI, and 288total bases. Pitcher Andy McGaffigan was selected as the league's top pitcher. The team also set a league attendance record, when a total of 575,676fans visited Greer Stadium. This record still stands as of the completion of the 2016 season. Their 97–46 record is the franchise's all-time best. In 2001, the 1980 Sounds were ranked as the sixty-ninth greatest minor league baseball team of all-time by baseball historians.|$|E

Rather than letters being put together to make <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> in Western languages, Baybayin uses symbols to represent syllables.|$|E
40|$|This article traces <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> it echoes through {{approaches}} to displaying the Science Museum’s acoustics collection {{over the course}} of the twentieth century. Focusing on three key moments in the collection’s historical development, the article explores the role of <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> both medium and object of museum display. Each moment exposes how the practice of using sound to interpret sounding objects was articulated and problematised by past generations of museum practitioners. Each moment, too, exposes the problem of <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> a potential threat to the cultural politics of a national museum, disrupting the economies of the senses governing the museum as a consecrated space for learning. Thinking historically, this article excavates a body of practical experience and expertise which has the potential to support a growing body of modern museum practitioners using <b>sound</b> <b>as</b> a medium for, and object of, museum display...|$|R

25|$|Enthusiasts {{consider}} EVP to {{be a form}} of paranormal phenomenon {{often found}} in recordings with static or other background noise. However, psychologists regard EVP as a form of auditory pareidolia (interpreting random <b>sounds</b> <b>as</b> voices in one's own language) and a pseudoscience promulgated by popular culture. Rational explanations for EVP include apophenia (perceiving patterns in random information), equipment artifacts, and hoaxes.|$|E
