5000|$|<b>Sulfalene</b> (INN, USAN) or sulfametopyrazine (BAN) is a long-acting sulfonamide {{antibacterial}} {{used for}} the treatment of chronic bronchitis, urinary tract infections and malaria. As of 2014 there were only two countries in which it is currently still marketed: Thailand and Ireland.|$|E
50|$|Two {{trials in}} Northern Nigeria {{combined}} multiple rounds of MDA and insecticide spraying. The first trial, in Kankiya, included 11 rounds of MDA combined with 8 rounds of DDT indoor spraying. The study {{was based on}} computer-aided models that showed that MDA could eradicate malaria {{in the study area}} if combined with an appropriate ‘insecticide attack’. Following MDAs, parasite prevalence dropped from 19% to 1%. The investigators did not consider this a success because parasite prevalence increased again after the interventions were stopped. Entomological indices also showed only a temporary reduction in transmission, which was completely reversed after the control measures ceased. Because the investigators felt that the failure of the trial to interrupt transmission was due to operational inadequacies, they recommended a much larger and more sophisticated evaluation of insecticide spraying combined with MDA. This recommendation helped to launch the Garki project, also in Northern Nigeria, in 1969. In the Garki project, all 164 study villages in the catchment area were sprayed with propoxur, a residual insecticide. In addition, in 60 villages, MDA with <b>sulfalene</b> / pyrimethamine was given at 10-week intervals for two years. In two small village clusters, house spraying was supplemented with larvicide and MDA every two weeks. With biweekly MDA, parasite prevalence fell to 1% in the dry season and to 5% in the rainy season. MDA given every 10 weeks resulted in a parasite prevalence of 2% in the dry season and 28% in the rainy season. Transmission was not interrupted with either MDA regime. The authors concluded that spraying of residual insecticides and MDA did not result in a sustainable interruption of malaria transmission.|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{detection}} {{and analysis of}} a suspected counterfeit sample of the antimalarial medicine Metakelfin through developing Nitrogen- 14 Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (14 N NQR) spectroscopy at a quantitative level. The sensitivity of quadrupolar parameters to the solid-state chemical environment of the molecule enables development of a technique capable of discrimination between the same pharmaceutical preparations made by different manufacturers. The 14 N NQR signal returned by a tablet (or tablets) from a Metakelfin batch suspected to be counterfeit was compared with that acquired from a tablet(s) from a known-to-be-genuine batch from the same named manufacturer. Metakelfin contains two active pharmaceutical ingredients, <b>sulfalene</b> and pyrimethamine and NQR analysis revealed spectral differences for the <b>sulfalene</b> component indicative of differences in the processing history of the two batches. Furthermore, the NQR analysis provided quantitative information that the suspected counterfeit tablets contained only 43 ?? 3 % as much <b>sulfalene</b> as the genuine Metakelfin tablets. Conversely, conventional nondestructive analysis by FT-Raman and FT-NIR spectroscopies only achieved differentiation between batches, but no ascription. HPLC-UV analysis of the suspect tablets revealed a <b>sulfalene</b> content of 42 ?? 2 % of the labelled claim. The degree of agreement shows the power of NQR {{as a means of}} the non-destructive identification and content-indicating first-stage analysis of counterfeit pharmaceuticals...|$|E
40|$|Potentiating {{combinations}} of 4 -aminobenzoic acid (PABA) competitors, such as sulfadoxine, <b>sulfalene,</b> or dapsone, and dihydrofolate dehydrogenasea (1. 5. 1. 4) inhibitors, such as pyrimethamine or proguanil, {{have been subjected}} to various trials over the last decade. By and large they have proved to be effective agents against drug-resistant strains of malaria parasites, and with the small doses required they have been free of toxic effects. Parasite resistance to such combinations has seldom occurred but may be associated with cross-resistance to other combinations. These combinations should be reserved for the treatment of chloroquine-resistant infections and for use as adjuvants in organized malaria eradication campaigns...|$|E
40|$|Sulfadimethoxine (SDM) is an {{antibiotic}} commonly added to animal feeds. Anti-SDM antibodies {{are useful for}} the detection of residual SDM in foods, feeds and biological fluids by ELISA. In this study, we show that SDM is immunogenic in rabbits when it is conjugated with soy 11 S globulin or with β-amylase. Rabbit anti-SDM antibodies obtained by immunization with SDM- 11 S and SDM-beta-amylase displayed low cross-reactivity against other sulfonamides, including sulfamethazine (SM 2), sulfasulfonamides (SN), sulfadiazine (SD), sulfamethoxypyrazine (SMP), <b>sulfalene</b> (SMZ), sulfaquinoxaline (SQX). Thus, soy 11 S globulin and β-amylase are suitable carriers for the induction of anti-SDM antibodies and have the advantage of being cheaper that BSA...|$|E
40|$|The latest {{developments}} and {{ideas in the}} therapy of leprosy are discussed, the need for long-term studies being stressed. The therapeutic efficacy and effective dosages of some sulfones (especially diaphenylsulfone), thiambutosine and long-acting sulfonamides such as sulfamethoxine and <b>sulfalene,</b> are considered. The possibilities for two newer drugs, 4, 4 ′-diacetyldiaminodiphenylsulfone and clofazimine (B- 663), both still {{in the early stages}} of evaluation, are also described and the potential value of thalidomide in treatment of the lepra reaction is discussed. The authors make a number of recommendations for controlled trials and lines of investigation and, in particular, favour a biochemical approach to the correction of defective host defences. Diaphenylsulfone is still considered the drug of choice for use in the therapy of leprosy...|$|E
40|$|For the {{treatment}} of malaria, combinations of drugs with antifolic action have the great advantage, compared with other drug associations, of synergic action, which increases {{the effectiveness of the}} preparation, limits its toxicity, and reduces the risk of resistance. The associations of a sulfonamide (<b>sulfalene,</b> S) with a diaminopyrimidine derivative (pyrimethamine, P, or trimethoprim, T) have given good immediate clinical results. An analysis of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics of the three components explains the relative ease with which relapse is encountered with the association ST. The association SP is, from this point of view, more logical and effective and its importance in prophylaxis is surveyed in the light of a critical discussion of the arguments that are at present throwing doubt on the usefulness of its wider employment...|$|E
40|$|The {{progressive}} {{spread in}} Asia and South America of falciparum malaria resistant to 4 -aminoquinolines, and the focal occurrence in all malarious regions of infections resistant to dihydrofolate dehydrogenase inhibitors such as pyrimethamine and proguanil, make it everywhere {{necessary to be}} alert {{to the failure of}} accepted curative, prophylactic, or sporontocidal chemotherapeutic agents. Resistance to 4 -aminoquinolines may be met curatively with courses of treatment lasting 1 - 14 days, or more, the longer courses relying on quinine, often with a sulfonamide, or on tetracyclines, and the shorter courses on associations of sulfonamides or sulfones with pyrimethamine or trimethoprim. Suppressive prophylaxis of these infections is obtained by the injection at 3 -month intervals of a repository mixture of acedapsone and cycloguanil, or by the weekly ingestion of sulfadoxine, <b>sulfalene,</b> or diformyl-dapsone associated with pyrimethamine, or the daily ingestion of dapsone with proguanil. Primaquine, although continuing to be an efficient sporontocide of P. falciparum when pyrimethamine and proguanil no longer suffice, is becoming less effective in preventing relapses of P. vivax in countries around New Guinea...|$|E
40|$|As serious but {{neglected}} {{public health}} problems, poor quality medicines, i. e. for antimalarial medicines, urged to be fought. One of the approaches {{is to consider}} the analytical chemistry and separative techniques. In this study, a generic liquid chromatographic method was firstly devel-oped {{for the purpose of}} screening 8 antimalarial active ingredients, namely amodiaquine (AQ), piperaquine (PPQ), <b>sulfalene</b> (SL), pyrimethamine (PM), lumefantrine (LF), artesunate (AS), artemether (AM) and dihydroartemisinine (DHA) by applying DoE/DS optimization strategy. Since the method was not totally satisfying in terms of peak separation, further experiments were undergone applying the same development strategy while splitting the 8 ingredients into five groups. Excellent prediction was observed prior to correlation between retention times of predicted and observed separation conditions. Then, a successful geometric transfer was realized to reduce the analysis time focusing on the simultaneous quantiﬁcation of two WHO's recommended ACTs in anti-malarial fixed-dose combination (AM-LF and AS-AQ) in tablets. The optimal separation was achieved using an isocratic elution of methanol-ammonium formate buffer (pH 2. 8; 10 mM) (82. 5 : 17. 5, v/v) at 0. 6 ml/min through a C 18 column (100 mm× 3. 5 mm, 3. 5 μm) thermostated at 25 °C. After a successful validation stage based on the total error approach, the method was applied to determine the content of AM/LF or AS/AQ in seven brands of antimalarial tablets currently marketed in West, Central and East Africa. Satisfying results were obtained compared to the claimed contents. Peer reviewe...|$|E
