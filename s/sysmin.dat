40|$|With the {{discovery}} in the 1970 s of two-billion year old nuclear reactor in Oklo, Gabon, the Paleoproterozoic of the Franceville basin (Gabon), neglected for many years, {{attracted the attention}} of the international community. This led to the intensive study of the basin for about ten years. Between 2006 and the present time, our studies have focused on the interaction between the Paleoproterozoic sediment filling (Francevillian) and tectonics. The work has been done in the frame of a large mapping project sponsored by the European Union (<b>SYSMIN</b> funds). Here we have reviewed the lithostratigraphy of the Francevillian and carbonate rocks of this series for a sedimentological and stable isotope study. Although the Francevillian series has been known for a long time, many difficulties, including access in the region, prevented such a scientific study. Our analysis establishes the palaeoenvironments of deposition with the first report of a sebkha series in the Francevillian, and also reveals a large positive excursion of carbon- 13 in the carbonates. This excursion is known on a worldwide scale in the 2. 22 - 2. 06 Ga time interval and is reported {{here for the first time}} in Gabon. The detailed analysis of this excursion coupled with the lithostratigraphy has considerable consequence on the regional stratigraphy and on the functioning of the basins or sub-basins which were drived by differential subsidence regimes. The inferred time interval of the excursion is in good agreement with the ages obtained from new radiometric dating of the series...|$|E
40|$|New {{field and}} geochronological data {{obtained}} {{in the course of}} a mapping project financed by the European Union (<b>Sysmin</b> Funds) and by the Gabonese Republic enable precise chronological constraints to be placed on the timing and context of BIF deposition in Gabon. Field and petrographic observations allow the BIF-hosting greenstone belts to be related to a single lithostratigraphic unit: the "Belinga Group" (Chevallier et al., 2002; Thiéblemont et al., 2009; Thiéblemont, 2009). This group was affected by a generalized Neoarchean tectono-metamorphic event which culminated at 2746 ± 7 Ma in Northeastern Gabon. Dating of detrital zircons from the BIF and related coarse-grained detrital rocks from 2918 ± 7 Ma to 2868 ± 9 Ma implies that the deposition and further deformation of the Belinga Group took place in the interval 2868 - 2750 Ma, close to the Mesoarchean - Neoarchean boundary. The Mesoarchean in Gabon was a period of intense plutonic activity, with a wide range of granitoids dated between ca. 3 Ga and 2. 8 Ga. Plutonism started with mainly intermediate rocks of dioritic to granodioritic composition and ended with the emplacement of pink granitoids of monzogranitic to syenogranitic composition. Precise geochronological data show that these granites were emplaced between 2870 and 2810 Ma. In addition to granitic plutonism and BIF deposition, the existence of vast charnockitic domains within the Mesoarchean basement attests for a period of intense heating of the recently accreted crust around the Mesoarchean - Neoarchean boundary. Repeated geochronological measurements (U/Pb on zircon, U-Th-Pb on monazite) on a syn- to late-charnockitic leucogranite from Northeastern Gabon enable this HT metamorphism to be precisely dated around 2820 Ma (~± 10 Ma). This implies that the emplacement of BIF around the Mesoarchean - Neoarchean boundary was correlative with an intense heat transfer from the mantle to the crust which preceded a major orogenic event around 2. 75 Ga...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} propose methodological {{solutions}} for reducing seismic risk in Caribbean urban zones, efforts concentrate on applying research activities. For example, elaborating seismic risk scenarios allows a better {{assessment of the}} consequences of an earthquake affecting the organization of social structures, in order to highlight sensitive sectors where considering seismic risk must be given priority. Because of its primary objectives, the <b>SYSMIN</b> II program in Dominican Republic takes place in this context. In this paper, we show how methodologies developed during seismic microzonation studies in the French West Indies, were suitable to be applied to the case of Hispaniola, the second island in the Greater Antilles. The north of Hispaniola is threatened by the eventual rupture of a major seismogenic fault zone, named Septentrional. The town of Santiago de los Caballeros in the Dominican Republic is particularly exposed because of its close location to this fault (< 10 km). The paper gathers results obtained from the seismic hazard and microzonation studies developed in the city of Santiago: i) quantification of regional seismic hazard dominated by the Septentrional fault, ii) a new geological mapping of superficial formations at the scale 1 : 10. 000, and iii) mapping of zones of homogeneous seismic response and liquefaction susceptibility. These interpretations are based on field geotechnical and geophysical measures, but also on the geological expertise achieved over several years in the Cibao region by the consortium IGME-BRGM-INYPSA. On the French West Indies, the volcanic origin of the geological formations punctuated by sedimentary episodes, gives a particular signature to the amplification phenomena of seismic vibrations due to site effects. The investigations carried out in Santiago revealed a new issue: surprisingly minor site effects (based on the H/V method of ambient noise) in the plastic continental argillaceous unit that represents the main layer for foundations in the whole city area...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is twofold: to make a {{geological}} interpretation of available ground gravity and high resolution airborne magnetic surveys carried out over the Dominican Republic, and to define the spatial limits of key tectonic units of the Central Cordillera. Potential fields and petrophysical data allow the establishment of the spatial limits and the relationships of the key tectonic units at local and regional scale. Therefore, gravity and magnetic data have been integrated to produce models of the upper crustal structure across the Central Cordillera following corresponding geological cross-sections that have been extended in depth. Since there are no seismic or borehole data to constrain the models in our study area, modelling is based on potential field data and the analysis of the physical properties that have been measured from surface rocks (586 density and magnetic susceptibility samples). The main features of the potential fields maps are: (1) NW-SE-trending anomalies delineating the main tectonic units, which coincide with the major strike-slip fault zones that limit those units; (2) exceptional geophysical mapping examples of volcano-sedimentary units; and (3) significant anomalies due to a magmatism widely spread all over Hispaniola Island. The modelling results reveal the petrophysical heterogeneities and subsurface geometry of the tectonic units, faults and shear zones. The model shows that Tireo Fm extends up to 7 km in depth. The Duarte Complex has been modelled as a layer of c. 5 - 7 km in thickness beneath the Tireo Fm and the S. Juan Basin. Some of the intrusive bodies may reach depths of c. 8 km. © 2017, Instituto Geologico y Minero de Espana. All rights reserved.

40|$|We present new {{regional}} petrologic, geochemical, Sr–Nd isotopic, and U–Pb geochronological {{data on the}} Turonian–Campanian mafic igneous rocks of Central Hispaniola that provide important clues {{on the development of}} the Caribbean island-arc. Central Hispaniola is made up of three main tectonic blocks—Jicomé, Jarabacoa and Bonao—that include four broad geochemical groups of Late Cretaceous mafic igneous rocks: group I, tholeiitic to calc-alkaline basalts and andesites; group II, low-Ti high-Mg andesites and basalts; group III, tholeiitic basalts and gabbros/dolerites; and group IV, tholeiitic to transitional and alkalic basalts. These igneous rocks show significant differences in time and space, from arc-like to non-arc-like characteristics, suggesting that they were derived from different mantle sources. We interpret these groups as the record of Caribbean arc-rifting and back-arc basin development in the Late Cretaceous. The> 90 Ma group I volcanic rocks and associated cumulate complexes preserved in the Jicomé and Jarabacoa blocks represent the Albian to Cenomanian Caribbean island-arc material. The arc rift stage magmatism in these blocks took place during the deposition of the Restauración Formation from the Turonian–Coniacian transition (~ 90 Ma) to Santonian/Lower Campanian, particularly in its lower part with extrusion at 90 – 88 Ma of group II low-Ti, high-Mg andesites/basalts. During this time or slightly afterwards adakitic rhyolites erupted in the Jarabacoa block. Group III tholeiitic lavas represent the initiation of Coniacian–Lower Campanian back-arc spreading. In the Bonao block, this stage is represented by back-arc basin-like basalts, gabbros and dolerite/diorite dykes intruded into the Loma Caribe peridotite, as well as the Peralvillo Sur Formation basalts, capped by tuffs, shales and Campanian cherts. This dismembered ophiolitic stratigraphy indicates that the Bonao block is a fragment of an ensimatic back-arc basin. In the Jicomé and Jarabacoa blocks, the mainly Campanian group IV basalts of the Peña Blanca, Siete Cabezas and Pelona–Pico Duarte Formation, represent the subsequent stage of back-arc spreading and off-axis non-arc-like magmatism, caused by migration of the arc toward the northeast. These basalts have geochemical affinities with the mantle domain influenced by the Caribbean plume, suggesting that mantle was flowing toward the NE, beneath the extended Caribbean island-arc, in response to rollback of the subducting proto-Caribbean slab.

40|$|New field, petrographical, geochemical (major {{and trace}} element analyses) and geochronological (U/Pb zircon ages) data were {{obtained}} {{in the course of}} a mapping project financed by the European Union (<b>Sysmin</b> Funds) and by the Gabonese Republic. They enable precise constraints to be placed on the timing and characteristics of the Neoproterozoic evolution of SW-Gabon. The studied terrains lie at the northwestern end of the West Congo Belt. They are attributed to the West Congolian Group; the upper part of the Neoproterozoic series in this Panafrican belt. The magmatism in SW-Gabon is much less developed than in W-Congo where extensive accumulations of Neoproterozoic basic and felsic lavas exist. Until now, the only reported magmatic complex of possible Neoproterozoic age in SW-Gabon was a gabbroic intrusion from the Mayumba region, close to the Atlantic shore line. New geological mapping at the 1 / 200, 000 scale reveals possible extensions of this basic plutonism at the base of the West Congolian Group where it occurs as dispersed doleritic bodies and isolated ultrabasic rocks. As a whole, magmatism indeed appears to constitute a subordinated part of the Neoproterozoic terrains. A precise U/Pb zircon age of 904 ± 6 Ma obtained on the Mayumba Gabbro is similar to that of extensive basaltic lavas forming the lower-intermediate part of the neoproterozoic series in Congo (Mayumbian Group). Likewise, a 867 ± 4 Ma age has been obtained on discrete occurrences of biotite granite mapped around the Mayumba Gabbro. The Mayumba Gabbro displays a tholeiitic and strongly depleted signature consistent with emplacement in an extensional zone (rift) away from any convergent margin. Likewise, the biotite granite shows a typical within-plate signature of alkaline and rather "enriched" type. Following tholeiitic to alkaline magmatism, extension in the West Congo Belt of SW-Gabon appears to have occurred all along the Neoproterozoic resulting in the deposition of a thick series of alternating detrital and carbonated rocks. Possible volcanic-derived materials in this series are limited and restricted to its lower part, which is consistent with Gabon has having been located aside the major zone of extension within the West Congolian Belt. An U/Pb zircon age of 713 ± 49 Ma obtained on an isolated occurrence of tuffaceous rock from the upper part of the lower detrital group (Louila unit) places a first constraint on the timing of the filling of the basin in Gabon. This age is consistent with attribution of a subsequent tillitic unit (Niari Tillite) to the Marinoan (ca. 635 Ma) glaciation. Following this event, the mainly carbonated Schisto-calcaire Sub-group and subsequent detrital Schisto-gréseux Sub-group (equivalent to the Mpioka Sub-group of Congo) emplaced between 635 and ca. 600 Ma. Thus sedimentation in the West-Congolian basin of SW-Gabon appears to have occurred over a period of about 300 Ma, and ended in response to compressional movements induced by the West Congolian orogenesis...|$|E
