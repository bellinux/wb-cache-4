25|$|Melba made {{numerous}} gramophone (phonograph) {{records of}} her voice in England and America between 1904 (when she was already in her 40s) and 1926 for the Gramophone & Typewriter Company and the Victor Talking Machine Company. Most of these recordings, consisting of operatic arias, duets and ensemble pieces and songs, have been re-released on CD. The poor audio fidelity of the Melba recordings reflects {{the limitations of the}} early days of commercial sound recording. Melba's acoustical recordings (especially those made after her initial 1904 session) fail to capture vital overtones to the voice, leaving it without the body and warmth it possessed– albeit to a limited degree– in life. Despite this, they still reveal Melba to have had an almost seamlessly pure lyric soprano voice with effortless coloratura, a smooth legato and accurate intonation. Melba had perfect pitch; the critic Michael Aspinall <b>says</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> complete London recordings issued on LP, that there are only two lapses from pitch in the entire set. Like Patti, and unlike the more vibrant-voiced Tetrazzini, Melba's exceptional purity of tone {{was probably one of the}} principal reasons why British audiences, with their strong choral and sacred music traditions, idolised her.|$|E
500|$|Ayola's {{first film}} {{appearance}} {{was in the}} 1993 film Great Moments in Aviation, written by Jeanette Winterson, in which she starred alongside Jonathan Pryce and John Hurt. Variety magazine's David Rooney said of her performance: [...] "In the film's most naturalistic turn, Ayola is a constant pleasure to watch. Unforced and appealing, she often succeeds in pulling the fanciful fireworks momentarily back down to Earth." [...] Ayola recalls having been daunted {{at the prospect of}} working alongside so many established names, but has deemed it to have been a [...] "wonderful experience". Her subsequent film credits are romantic comedy The Secret Laughter of Women, set in Nigeria and starring Colin Firth, thriller The i Inside, filmed in Sully Hospital, Cardiff, and starring Ryan Phillippe, and Sahara, filmed in Morocco whilst Ayola was pregnant with her first child, starring Penélope Cruz. Ayola <b>says</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> film career: [...] "I really like doing film [...] I've not done enough big films though to really know the difference between film and television." ...|$|E

2500|$|Holliday {{has been}} married twice. In March 1991, just two months after she met keyboardist Billy Meadows in a nightclub where she was singing, they married. [...] "He had {{a great sense of}} humor and he made me laugh all the time," [...] Holliday <b>says</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> first husband. [...] "I had been feeling bad for so long, I wanted to laugh." [...] But in December 1991, just nine months later, they divorced; the marriage, {{according}} to Holliday, [...] "ran out of steam." [...] She explained of Meadows: [...] "We just didn't know each other well enough." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1881, in New York, she {{performed}} in Esmerelda, a play written by Frances Hodgson Burnett and William Gillette. This play {{would later become}} {{one of her most}} successful and popular performances. Notwithstanding, reviews for the play, and for Russell's performance, were becoming unfavourable by the ninth month of the play's run—the reviewer <b>says</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> performance: [...] "If she cares for her future, she will not waste time in spoiling her voice. ...Lacking knowledge and training, she screams in a most unhappy fashion." [...] It ran for a year at the Madison Square Theatre and had over two hundred showings.|$|E
2500|$|Two female mannequins {{in a scene}} {{somewhat}} like a supermarket checkout. One mannequin sits naked on a lavatory with items dangling from her head: a nurse's cap, rusty horseshoes, a deflated balloon, charred bits of wood. The other's head is enclosed in a bird cage. The scene is covered with detritus: unwashed bowls and spoons with porridge and salad dried on. The everyday items are from the artist's own home, as are the leftovers. Wilkes <b>says</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> work that it [...] "apprehends an end point {{in our understanding of}} things as they area point at which words become insufficient, and the naming of objects is disconnected from our experience of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jacqueline also didn't {{like the}} {{atmosphere}} at Ann Summers, which was David Gold's [...] "upmarket clean" [...] sex shop. Gold <b>says</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> introduction: [...] "It wasn't a very nice atmosphere to work in. It was all men, it was the sex industry as we all perceive it to be". But, a chance invitation and visit to a Tupperware party at an East London flat in 1981 changed everything– Jacqueline saw the potential of selling sexy lingerie and sex toys to women {{in the privacy of}} their own homes. Jacqueline launched the Ann Summers Party Plan– a home marketing plan for sex toys, with a strict [...] "no men allowed" [...] policy. This type of party, which provides women with a forum to meet and talk about sex (and other matters), became so popular that such parties are now regarded as part of British popular culture; this format also provides the company with a convenient way of circumventing legal restrictions about displaying sex toys for sale.|$|E

2500|$|Eliot {{originally}} considered entitling {{the poem}} He do the Police in Different Voices. In {{the version of}} the poem Eliot brought back from Switzerland, the first two sections of the poem—'The Burial of the Dead' and 'A Game of Chess'—appeared under this title. This strange phrase is taken from Charles Dickens' novel Our Mutual Friend, in which the widow Betty Higden <b>says</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> adopted foundling son Sloppy, [...] "You mightn't think it, but Sloppy is a beautiful reader of a newspaper. He do the Police in different voices." [...] Some critics use this working title to support the theory that, {{while there are many}} different voices (speakers) in the poem, there is only one central consciousness. What was lost by the rejection of this title Eliot might have felt compelled to restore by commenting on the commonalities of his characters in his note about Tiresias, stating that 'What Tiresias sees, in fact, is the substance of the poem.' ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2003, Dushku {{starred in}} the horror film Wrong Turn and The Kiss, an {{independent}} comedy-drama. Starting that same year, she starred in a new Fox supernatural drama, Tru Calling, where she played the main character, medical student Tru Davies. After having a grant pulled out from under her, Tru is forced {{to take a job}} at a local morgue where she discovers her power to [...] "re-live" [...] the previous day over again if one of the deceased asks for her help to change what has happened. Dushku turned down a role in a spin-off of Buffy The Vampire Slayer which would have been about Faith. She has had many roles as a [...] "bad girl" [...] in movies and relishes the opportunities. In an interview with Maxim in May 2001, Dushku <b>says</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> roles, [...] "It's easy to play a bad girl: You just do everything you've been told not to do, and you don't {{have to deal with the}} consequences, because it's only acting." ...|$|E
2500|$|Having {{failed to}} perform Roman masculinity and virtue, Antony's only means {{with which he}} might [...] "write himself into Rome's {{imperial}} narrative and position himself at the birth of empire" [...] is to cast himself in the feminine archetype of the sacrificial virgin; [...] "once [...] understands his failed virtus, his failure to be Aeneas, he then tries to emulate Dido". Antony and Cleopatra {{can be read as}} a rewrite of Virgil's epic, with the sexual roles reversed and sometimes inverted. James J Greene writes on the subject: [...] "If one of the seminally powerful myths in the cultural memory of our past is Aeneas' rejection of his African queen in order to go on and found the Roman Empire, than it is surely significant that Shakespeare's ... depicts precisely and quite deliberately the opposite course of action from that celebrated by Virgil. For Antony... turned his back {{for the sake of his}} African queen on that same Roman state established by Aeneas". Antony even attempts to commit suicide for his love, falling short in the end. He is incapable of [...] "occupying the... politically empowering place" [...] of the female sacrificial victim. The abundant imagery concerning his person—"of penetration, wounds, blood, marriage, orgasm, and shame"—informs the view of some critics that the Roman [...] "figures Antony's body as queer, that is, as an open male body... not only 'bends' in devotion' but... bends over". In reciprocal contrast, [...] "in both Caesar and Cleopatra we see very active wills and energetic pursuit of goals". While Caesar's empirical objective can be considered strictly political, however, Cleopatra's is explicitly erotic; she conquers carnally—indeed, [...] "she made great Caesar lay his sword to bed;/ He plough'd her, and she cropp'd" [...] (2.2.232–233). Her mastery is unparalleled when it comes to the seduction of certain powerful individuals, but popular criticism supports the notion that [...] "as far as Cleopatra is concerned, the main thrust of the play's action might be described as a machine especially devised to bend her to the Roman will... and no doubt Roman order is sovereign at the end of the play. But instead of driving her down to ignominy, the Roman power forces her upward to nobility". Caesar <b>says</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> final deed, [...] "Bravest at the last,/ She levelled at our purposes, and, being royal,/ Took her own way" [...] (5.2.325–327).|$|E
5000|$|Anne's snobbery {{and pride}} were {{considered}} to be intolerable, yet she was highly intelligent and determined. Antonio de Guaras, a Spanish merchant living in London, would later <b>say</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> that she was [...] "more presumptuous than Lucifer".|$|R
60|$|What chiefly {{surprised}} Edmund was, that Crawford's sister, {{the friend}} and companion {{who had been}} so much to her, should not be more visibly regretted.

I find in her a quantity of shrewd observation, an excellent fund of criticism, but I cannot connect them into any peculiar vision. Her sarcasm at the expense of her friends is delightful, but I doubt whether it is more than an attempt to mould herself from outside, by the impact of hostilities, to emphasise her isolation.
