5|$|Caudal scutes {{have been}} {{preserved}} on struthiosaurines. The osteoderms are compressed inwards from the side, have a slope positioned anteriorly, and a <b>square-shaped</b> posterior edge.|$|E
5|$|The {{two arms}} of the {{cruciform}} plan contains different thrones for use in different royal functions; these included the Mother-of-Pearl Throne (พระแท่นราชบัลลังก์ประดับมุก) which stands almost at {{the centre of the}} hall between the intersecting points of the four arms. The <b>square-shaped</b> throne is entirely inlaid with mother-of-pearl, dating from the reign of King Rama I. It was saved from the Amarinthara Pisek Maha Prasat, when the throne hall burnt down in 1789. The throne is topped by the Royal Nine-tiered Umbrella.|$|E
5|$|A quadrangular castle, Bodiam {{is roughly}} <b>square-shaped.</b> This type of castle, {{with a central}} {{courtyard}} and buildings against the curtain wall, was characteristic of castle architecture in the 14th century. Bodiam Castle {{has been described by}} military historian Cathcart King as the most complete surviving example of a quadrangular castle. There are circular towers at each of the four corners, with square central towers in the south, east, and west walls. The main entrance is a twin-towered gatehouse in the north face of the castle. There is a second entrance from the south; the postern gate is through a square tower {{in the middle of the}} south wall. The towers are three storeys high, taller than the curtain walls and the buildings in the castle which are two storeys high.|$|E
5|$|On {{the west}} (rear) of the Ellwood House, the {{circular}} limestone water tower is about 50 feet (15.2 m) tall {{and has a}} diameter of 18 feet (5.5 m). The tower has windows occurring at different levels, which are arched and include keystones in their design. The water tower was built in 1879, {{the same year as}} Ellwood House, and at that time the structure was topped with a wooden water tank with a conical roof. Between 1897 and 1910 the wooden tank was removed and replaced with an additional 30 courses of stone which matched the original structure. The arched door {{at the base of the}} water tower was replaced with a larger <b>square-shaped</b> double door. The roof remained conical and of wood construction until about 1950 when it was replaced with sheet metal.|$|E
5|$|Archaea and {{bacteria}} are generally similar {{in size and}} shape, although a few archaea have very strange shapes, such as the flat and <b>square-shaped</b> cells of Haloquadratum walsbyi. Despite this morphological similarity to bacteria, archaea possess genes and several metabolic pathways that are {{more closely related to}} those of eukaryotes, notably the enzymes involved in transcription and translation. Other aspects of archaeal biochemistry are unique, such as their reliance on ether lipids in their cell membranes, including archaeols. Archaea use more energy sources than eukaryotes: these range from organic compounds, such as sugars, to ammonia, metal ions or even hydrogen gas. Salt-tolerant archaea (the Haloarchaea) use sunlight as an energy source, and other species of archaea fix carbon; however, unlike plants and cyanobacteria, no known species of archaea does both. Archaea reproduce asexually by binary fission, fragmentation, or budding; unlike bacteria and eukaryotes, no known species forms spores.|$|E
5|$|Mississippian {{society was}} complex, dense, and highly developed; the largest Mississippian city of Cahokia (in Illinois) {{contained}} {{as many as}} 30,000 inhabitants. They had a class society with certain groups specializing as artisans. The elite held related political and religious positions. Their cities were typically sited near rivers. Representing their cosmology, the central developments were dominated by a large central mound, several smaller mounds, and a large open plaza. Wooden palisades were built later around the complex, apparently for defensive purposes. The remains of a major settlement known as Angel Mounds lie east of present-day Evansville. Mississippian houses were generally <b>square-shaped</b> with plastered walls and thatched roofs. For reasons that remain unclear, the Mississippians disappeared {{in the middle of}} the 15thcentury, about 200years before the Europeans first entered what would become modern Indiana. Mississippian culture marked the high point of native development in Indiana.|$|E
5|$|Since retirement, three early-generation Comet {{airframes}} {{have survived}} in museum collections. The only complete remaining Comet 1, a Comet 1XB with the registration G-APAS, is {{displayed at the}} RAF Museum Cosford. While painted in BOAC colours, it never flew for the airline, having been first delivered to Air France {{and then to the}} Ministry of Supply after conversion to 1XB standard; this aircraft also served with the RAF as XM823. The sole surviving Comet fuselage with the original <b>square-shaped</b> windows, part of a Comet 1A registered F-BGNX, has undergone restoration and is on display at the de Havilland Aircraft Museum in Hertfordshire, England. A Comet C2 Sagittarius with serial XK699, later maintenance serial 7971M, has been on display at the gate of RAF Lyneham in Wiltshire, England since 1987. In 2012, with the planned closure of RAF Lyneham, the aircraft was slated to be dismantled and shipped to the RAF Museum Cosford where it will be re-assembled for display.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of black}} and white line art for the game's {{graphics}} was an attempt to differentiate it from other games and catch the interest of gamers. Implementing it presented some challenges for the design staff. The design of Qbby, the player character, came after the idea of creating boxes was established; he was designed from a functional perspective. At one point in development, while brainstorming BoxBoy!s visual style, the team had considered making Kirby the main character. It become difficult trying to make Kirby, a round character, look natural in the box-producing action, so they settled with a character that had a <b>square-shaped</b> body, the same as the boxes. Feet were added to Qbby so he could move and jump, and eyes were added so the player could recognise which direction he was facing. Since Qbby had a simple design, the team focussed on making his animations expressive to ensure the character was engaging and had a personality.|$|E
5|$|A game {{is played}} between two teams, each {{composed}} of nine players, that take turns playing offense (batting and baserunning) and defense (pitching and fielding). A pair of turns, one at bat {{and one in the}} field, by each team constitutes an inning. A game consists of nine innings (seven innings {{at the high school level}} and in doubleheaders in college and minor leagues). One team—customarily the visiting team—bats in the top, or first half, of every inning. The other team—customarily the home team—bats in the bottom, or second half, of every inning. The goal of the game is to score more points (runs) than the other team. The players on the team at bat attempt to score runs by circling or completing a tour of the four bases set at the corners of the <b>square-shaped</b> baseball diamond. A player bats at home plate and must proceed counterclockwise to first base, second base, third base, and back home in order to score a run. The team in the field attempts both to prevent runs from scoring and to record outs, which remove opposing players from offensive action until their turn in their team's batting order comes up again. When three outs are recorded, the teams switch roles for the next half-inning. If the score of the game is tied after nine innings, extra innings are played to resolve the contest. Many amateur games, particularly unorganized ones, involve different numbers of players and innings.|$|E
5|$|BoxBoy! is {{a puzzle}} {{platform}} video {{game in which}} players control a <b>square-shaped</b> character named Qbby. The goal {{of the game is}} to guide Qbby through a series of obstacle-filled stages that are divided into sets called worlds. Each world is focussed on a particular gameplay theme; for example one world introduces stages that contain deadly lasers, and another introduces cranes for transporting Qbby around. The central gameplay mechanic is Qbby's ability to create boxes and make use of them to clear the obstacles. Boxes are created one at a time as a connected string and the maximum number of boxes in a string varies between each stage. Qbby can detach the string of boxes then push it to different positions. The boxes can be used to overcome obstacles, such as creating a bridge to pass bottomless pits or building staircases to reach higher platforms. Additionally, Qbby can keep the string of boxes attached to his body. He may then use the boxes as a shield to block hazards such as deadly lasers. He is also able to grapple onto ledges and pull himself up by retracting through the boxes. Creating a new string of boxes causes the previous string to disappear. If Qbby dies, he will respawn at a nearby checkpoint.|$|E
25|$|A mousepad {{is a hard}} surface, <b>square-shaped</b> and {{rubberized}} mat {{for enhancing}} the usability of a computer mouse. Jack Kelley invented the mousepad in 1969.|$|E
25|$|The VeSFET (vertical-slit field-effect transistor) is a <b>square-shaped</b> junctionless FET with {{a narrow}} slit {{connecting}} the source and drain at opposite corners. Two gates occupy the other corners, and control the current through the slit.|$|E
25|$|Fort Willem I is {{situated}} {{in the middle of}} a rice field. The main building is a <b>square-shaped</b> fort of 178 x 178 meter. Small storage buildings were situated around 94 meter away from the fort at each cardinal points.|$|E
25|$|The AirPort Extreme was updated on January 9, 2007, {{to support}} the 802.11n protocol. This {{revision}} also adds two LAN ports {{for a total of}} three. It now more closely resembles the <b>square-shaped</b> 1st generation Apple TV and Mac Mini, and is about {{the same size as the}} mini.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} courtyard has a Roman arch {{entrance to}} the south (São Salvador Gate), consisting of two rows of staves, the inner more narrow and wide, guarded by two rectangular towers: the left is partially destroyed and the other the keep tower, to the north, <b>square-shaped</b> with two floors, flanked by a smallTraitors' Gate.|$|E
25|$|The <b>square-shaped</b> bell-tower, {{which is}} the main {{entrance}} the municipal offices and cloister, extends to three-floors, and topped by a railing of balusters, with ornate cornices and parapet with pinnacles. Access to the building is made through a gated archway, while successive floors continue the Roman archway theme in windows and narrow, double bell-tower openings.|$|E
25|$|Its body is round, {{particularly}} when well fed, and tapers less smoothly {{to the head}} than the tail. The sudden tapering {{to the base of}} its neck gives it the appearance of shoulders, unique among cetaceans. The tailfin grows and becomes increasingly and ornately curved as the animal ages. The flippers are broad and short—making them almost <b>square-shaped.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Short 330 was {{developed}} by Short Brothers of Belfast from Short's earlier Short Skyvan STOL utility transport. The 330 had a longer wingspan and fuselage than the Skyvan, while retaining the Skyvan's <b>square-shaped</b> fuselage cross section, allowing it to carry up to 30 passengers while retaining good short field characteristics. The first prototype of the 330 flew on 22 August 1974.|$|E
25|$|In {{the weeks}} before Passover, matzos are {{prepared}} for holiday consumption. In many Orthodox Jewish communities, men traditionally gather in groups ("chaburas") to bake handmade matzo for use at the Seder, the dough being rolled by hand, resulting in a large and round matzo. Chaburas also work together in machine-made matzo factories, which produce the typically <b>square-shaped</b> matzo sold in stores.|$|E
25|$|The {{fig tree}} (ficus carica) grew {{well in the}} hill country and {{produced}} two crops a season. Early ripening figs were regarded as delicacy because of their sweetness and were eaten fresh. Figs ripening in the later harvest were often dried and strung into a chain, or pressed into hard round or <b>square-shaped</b> cakes called a develah, and stored as {{a major source of}} winter food. The blocks of dried fig were sliced and eaten like bread.|$|E
25|$|Not all coins are round. The Australian 50 cent coin, for example, has twelve flat sides. Some coins have wavy edges, e.g. the $2 and 20-cent coins of Hong Kong and the 10 cent coins of Bahamas. Some are <b>square-shaped,</b> {{such as the}} 15 cent coin of the Bahamas and the 50 cent coin from Aruba. During the 1970s, Swazi coins were minted {{in several}} shapes, {{including}} squares, polygons, and wavy edged circles with 8 and 12 waves.|$|E
25|$|In the {{architecture}} of Cistercian churches the transept is usually quite wide and the lateral aisles are covered with groined vaults that help to sustain the longitudinal central nave. There is a clear preference for <b>square-shaped</b> apses, more simple and economical to build. The columns and piers supporting pointed-arched arcades (already a proto-Gothic feature), have big strong capitals and stand on rectangular blocks on the ground floor. Although Tarouca Abbey was clearly inspired in the Burgundian abbeys of Clairvaux and Fontenay and Salzedas still have some similarities with Fontfroide, their authentic and magnificent Cistercian architectural features are mixed with local Portuguese decorative motifs.|$|E
25|$|The mosque is {{much larger}} than the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque of Delhi. The {{exterior}} of the building is <b>square-shaped,</b> with each side measuring 259 feet. There are two entrances, one at the south, and another at the east. The prayer area (the actual mosque) is located in the west, while the north side faces a hill rock. The actual mosque building on the western side has 10 domes and 124 pillars; there are 92 pillars on the eastern side; and 64 pillars on each of the remaining sides. Thus, there are 344 pillars in the entire building. Out of these, only 70 pillars remain standing now.|$|E
25|$|The site of {{the mosque}} was {{originally}} a Sanskrit college building commissioned by Vigraharaja IV (alias Visaladeva), a king of the Shakambhari Chahamana (Chauhan) dynasty. The original building was <b>square-shaped,</b> with a tower-chhatri (dome-shaped pavilion) at each corner. A temple dedicated to Sarasvati was located on the western side. A tablet dated to 1153 CE was found at the site in the 19th century; based on this, it can be inferred that the original building must have been constructed sometime before 1153 CE. According to the local Jain tradition, the building was originally constructed by Seth Viramdeva Kala in 660 CE as a Jain shrine to celebrate Panch Kalyanaka.|$|E
25|$|Square step cuts whose corners are not {{truncated}} {{are known}} as carré; they are also characteristic of antique jewelry. They may resemble the <b>square-shaped</b> Princess cut in passing, but a carré's lack of fire and simpler facets are distinctive. They {{may or may not}} have a culet. In Western jewelry dating to before the advent of brilliant-type cuts, very shallow step-cut stones were used as lustrous covers for miniature paintings: these are known in the antique trade as portrait stones. Characteristic of Indian jewelry are lasque diamonds, which may be the earliest form of step cut. They are flat stones with large tables and asymmetric outlines.|$|E
25|$|The Moors built strong castles and fortifications in {{many cities}} but, {{although}} many Portuguese mediaeval castles originated in the Islamic period, {{most of them have}} been extensively remodelled after the Christian reconquest. One of the best-preserved is Silves Castle, located in Silves, the ancient capital of the Al-Garb, today's Algarve. Built between the 8th and 13th centuries, Silves Castle has preserved its walls and <b>square-shaped</b> towers from the Moorish period, as well as 11th-century cisterns– water reservoirs used in case of a siege. The old Moorish centre of the city– the Almedina– was defended by a wall and several fortified towers and gates, parts of which are still preserved.|$|E
25|$|The Museum has {{exhibition}} {{rooms and}} store rooms for works of art, distributed across three floors. The upper floor is {{the location of}} the cafeteria/restaurant, esplanade and multi-purpose rooms, the entrance floor has exhibition rooms and a bookshop and the lower floor houses the library and auditorium. Access to these spaces is facilitated via a <b>square-shaped</b> atrium located next to the reception, complemented by a cloakroom and information area, in an area adjacent to the Museum entrance. The Museum building also has a workshops area and another area for activities of the Educational Service, together with complementary areas such as a shop and a large terrace overlooking the Park.|$|E
25|$|The chest tombs {{date from}} the early to mid-19th-century and are of {{limestone}} ashlar. They contain, variously, moulded plinths, slate tablets or panels either <b>square-shaped</b> or oval, and hipped tops. One is topped by a slate slab. Two are coffin shaped. Three contain at their corners, either buttresses, pilasters, or half-balusters. One has an arch-shaped headstone attached. Another, large and shaped like a sarcophagus, has rebatescontinuous notch cut into an edgeat corners, a deep cornice, and a gabled top. Ascribed tombs are one to 'R Brewin of Grantham', and two to 'Green of Denton'. A chest tomb, dated 1813, is to Henry Blakelock (and family), who was the upholsterer for the Duke of Rutland.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} 1641 from Glasgow {{was made to}} replace the ancient Saint Mungo's. This bell had the Chapter of Glasgow's seal on it, a tree and a salmon, {{together}} with a representation of an ancient <b>square-shaped</b> bell; like that of Saint Mungo, which still existed at that date. Saint Mungo's bell was rescued by a Glasgow magistrate, James Laing, after the reformation and the Glasgow officials purchased it for the substantial sum of £10 Scots in 1577. In 1640 the council had a new dead bell made, Saint Mungo's bell probably having become too worn. This was then used {{for many years and}} then lost; however in 1867 it was recovered and returned to the Glasgow corporation. The present whereabouts of Saint Mungo's bell is unknown.|$|E
25|$|The plan of {{the castle}} is quadrangular with a semicircular wall. The ruins of the highest part, as well as forming {{the core of the}} building, belong to what was once the {{residential}} area of the castle. Indeed, there is a chapel with a vaulted apse, a belfry and a cistern that was used as a warehouse Another area, offset from the chapel, retains many features, including a vaulted roof, a small partly walled embrasure, and an arched opening. Finally, there is a room with an iron-beamed roof. Built of local stone, the fort has vaulted roofs and tiled floors. The most significant architectural features are its two towers, indicating the military function of the castle. One of them, <b>square-shaped,</b> was built in the Swabian period, the other, however, is circular and was built in the Angevin period.|$|E
25|$|The building's {{lower level}} has been {{historically}} used for commercial purposes. As a corner lot, {{the first floor}} L-elevation has one <b>square-shaped</b> volume facing west towards Paseo Atocha, while the other two commercial spaces occupy the longitudinal axis that runs east-to-west along Castillo Street. The commercial spaces are of different sizes. In all three sections, the original floors were replaced with native tiles, product of an early 20th century intervention. The 12-foot high ceiling in the <b>square-shaped</b> section is covered with pressed tin panels, a decorative addition very frequently used during the 1920s among the upper class' residences and social/civic buildings in different cities in Puerto Rico. Meanwhile, the 17-foot high ceiling {{in the other two}} commercial areas have kept the original exposed ausubo (manilkara bidentata tree) beams, sustaining the pichipen rafters, which support three layers of thin bricks that make-up the foundation for the upper level floor. Throughout the entire first floor's interior, the stucco has been removed, leaving the brick walls completely exposed. Each commercial section has its own service room. The 110 feet 5 inches long longitudinal elevation that faces Castillo Street has a very public exposure with four large clear glass windows and an equal number of clear-glass-metal-framed doors. The axis that faces Paseo Atocha has an additional glass door and two large glass windows. All three spaces at the first floor have access to a narrow backyard limited by a seven-foot high brick and masonry wall, which runs east-to-west, and separates the commercial space, physically and visually, from a large open garden-like interior patio only accessible to the upper-level residents. The Castillo Street axis has, on its eastern end, an arched wooden gate, that provide access to the cochera (carport), which by the time Casa Vives was built in the 1860s, served to properly house the family's horse stagecoach, and later, during the early twentieth century, housed the Ford's model T's and Model A's.|$|E
25|$|In 1632 a tow canal between Haarlem and Amsterdam, the Haarlemmertrekvaart was opened, {{the first}} tow canal in the country. The empty {{areas in the}} city that were a result of the fire of 1576 were filled with new houses and {{buildings}}. Even outside the city wall buildings were constructed—in 1643 about 400 houses were counted outside the wall. Having buildings outside the city walls was not a desirable situation to the city administration. Not only because these buildings would be vulnerable in case of an attack on the city, but there was also less control over taxes and city regulations outside the walls. Therefore, a major project was initiated in 1671: expanding the city northwards. Two new canals were dug, and a new defensive wall was constructed (the current Staten en Prinsenbolwerk). Two old city gates, the Janspoort and Kruispoort, were demolished. The idea that a city had to be <b>square-shaped</b> was abandoned.|$|E
25|$|The first {{departure}} within mosque design {{started in}} Persia (Iran). The Persians had inherited a rich architectural legacy {{from the earlier}} Persian dynasties, and they began incorporating elements from earlier Parthian and Sassanid designs into their mosques, influenced by buildings such as the Palace of Ardashir and the Sarvestan Palace. Thus, Islamic architecture witnessed the introduction of such structures as domes and large, arched entrances, referred to as iwans. During Seljuq rule, as Islamic mysticism was on the rise, the four-iwan arrangement took form. The four-iwan format, finalized by the Seljuqs, and later inherited by the Safavids, firmly established the courtyard façade of such mosques, with the towering gateways at every side, as {{more important than the}} actual buildings themselves. They typically took the form of a <b>square-shaped</b> central courtyard with large entrances at each side, giving the impression of gateways to the spiritual world. The Persians also introduced Persian gardens into mosque designs. Soon, a distinctly Persian style of mosques started appearing that would significantly influence the designs of later Timurid, and also Mughal, mosque designs.|$|E
25|$|A {{diagnosis}} {{is a statement}} of the anatomical features of an organism (or group) that collectively distinguish it from all other organisms. Some, but not all, of the features in a diagnosis are also autapomorphies. An autapomorphy is a distinctive anatomical feature that is unique to a given organism or group. According to Ezcurra (2006) and Ezcurra and Novas (2006), Zupaysaurus can be distinguished based on the following characteristics: the maxillary fenestra is within the antorbital fossa (according to Ezcurra, 2006), the rostral process of the lacrimal is ventrally bowed (according to Ezcurra, 2006), the ventral process of the squamosal is kinked (according to Ezcurra, 2006), wide contact between squamosal and quadratojugal (according to Ezcurra, 2006). The maxillary-jugal ventral margin describes an obtuse angle in lateral view (according to Ezcurra and Novas, 2006), a notch on the dorsal margin of the ascending process of the maxilla, relating to horizontal ramus of the lacrimal is rostrally tapering onto the forked caudal tip of the ascending process of the maxilla; (according to Ezcurra and Novas, 2006), a lacrimal with a highly pneumatized antorbital recess (according to Ezcurra and Novas, 2006), a short and <b>square-shaped</b> retroarticular process of the mandible (according to Ezcurra and Novas, 2006), the cnemial crest is poorly developed (according to Ezcurra and Novas, 2006).|$|E
