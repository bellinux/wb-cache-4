This effect was studied in a system where nitrogen was the adsorbate and tungsten was the adsorbent by Paul Kisliuk (1922–2008) in 1957. To compensate for the increased probability of adsorption occurring around molecules present on the substrate surface, Kisliuk developed the precursor state theory, whereby molecules would enter a precursor state at the interface between the solid adsorbent and adsorbate in the gaseous phase. From here, adsorbate molecules would either adsorb to the adsorbent or desorb into the gaseous phase.

40|$|Gas-grain and gas-phase {{reactions}} {{dominate the}} formation of molecules in the interstellar medium (ISM). Gas-grain reactions require a substrate (e. g. a dust or ice grain) on which the reaction is able to occur. The formation of molecular hydrogen (H$_ 2 $) in the ISM is the prototypical example of a gas-grain reaction. In these reactions, an atom of hydrogen will strike a surface, stick to it, and diffuse across it. When it encounters another adsorbed hydrogen atom, the two can react to form molecular hydrogen and then be ejected from the surface by the energy released in the reaction. We perform in-depth classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of hydrogen atoms interacting with an amorphous water-ice surface. This study focuses on {{the first step in}} the formation process; the sticking of the hydrogen atom to the substrate.

The aim of this work is to characterize quantitatively the physical processes {{that are involved in}} the desorption kinetics of CO-O 2 ices by interpreting laboratory temperature programmed desorption (TPD) data. This information is used to simulate the behavior of CO-O 2 ices under astrophysical conditions. Methods. The TPD spectra have been recorded under ultra high vacuum conditions for pure, layered and mixed morphologies for different thicknesses, temperatures and mixing ratios. An empirical kinetic model is used to interpret the results and to provide input parameters for astrophysical models. Results. Binding energies are determined for different ice morphologies.

Binding energies and temperature-dependent <b>sticking</b> <b>probabilities</b> for CO–CO, O 2 –O 2 and CO–O 2 are determined.

40|$|Film-like and thread-like systems are, respectively, {{defined by}} the {{property}} {{that one of the}} constituting homogenous phases has a constant thickness (δ) or a constant normal cross section (of largest chord δ).

This CF closely approximates the generating <b>stick</b> <b>probability</b> function in the range of distances larger than δ. The surface and the curve CFs, respectively, behave as 1 /r and as 1 /r 2 as r approaches zero. This result implies that the relevant small-angle scattering intensities behave as PS}/q^ 2 or as P C/ q in the intermediate range of the scattering vector magnitude (q) and as l Pq^ 4 in the outermost q range. Similarly to P, pre-factors PS and PC simply depend on some structural parameters. Depending on the scale resolution it may happen that a given sample looks thread like at large scale, film like at small scale and particulate at a finer scale. An explicit example is reported. As a practical illustration of the above results, the surface and the curve CFs of some simple geometrical shapes have been explicitly evaluated.
