2500|$|After the game, many sports writers {{commented on}} Warner's rise from an unknown backup to a Super Bowl MVP, but Warner himself wasn't {{impressed}} by it. [...] "How {{can you be}} in awe of something that you expect yourself to do?" [...] Warner pointed out. [...] "People think this season {{is the first time}} I touched a football; they don't realize I've been doing this for years – just not on this level, because I never got the chance. <b>Sure,</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> my tough times, but you don't sit there and say, 'Wow, I was stocking groceries five years ago, and look at me now.' You don't think about it, and when you do achieve something, you know luck {{has nothing to do with}} it." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Michael Lewis in Vanity Fair: [...] "Many of the {{articles}} attacking her accused her of making a very specific forecast — {{as many as a}} hundred defaults within a year! — that failed to materialize... But that's not at all what she had said: her words were being misrepresented so that her message might be more easily attacked. 'She was referring to the complacency of the ratings agencies and investment advisers who say there is nothing to worry about,' said a person at 60 Minutes who reviewed the transcripts of the interview for me, to make <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> heard what I thought I had heard. She says there is something to worry about, and it will be apparent to everyone in the next 12 months." ...|$|E
2500|$|Davis {{became the}} first player through to the last 16 when he {{defeated}} Drago 5–1, after which he expressed his surprise {{he was still in}} the tournament. O'Sullivan overcame a chest infection to beat Joe Swail 5–1, but missed his post-match press conference. Hunter came from 2–4 down with a score of 0–39 in the seventh to beat Ali Carter, compiling a century break in the decider. Preston's Ian McCulloch beat White 5–4 with a break of 73 in the deciding frame. After beating Robert Milkins 5–3, Hendry expressed dissatisfaction with his performance. Maguire, the Snooker Writers' Association Young Player of the Year, saw off Walden 5–3 and said of the chalk incident [...] "I made <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> it this time." [...] In the match between Fu and Hawkins Fu led 4–2, before Hawkins forced a deciding frame, which Fu won. Judge continued his run by defeating Campbell 5–4 with breaks of 76, 61, and 52, and said his victory over Williams had given him confidence. Wattana beat Doherty 5–3 by fluking the final brown from a , before potting blue and pink for the victory. Doherty said [...] "It was a cruel blow. ... I had James in a really good snooker and from where I was sat it did not even look as though he could hit it." [...] Of the other seeds, Lee enjoyed a 5–1 victory over Hamilton, Dott defeated Dale 5–2, Ebdon beat Joe Jogia 5–4, Perry beat David Gray 5–3 and McManus lost 4–5 against Nigel Bond. The other non-seeded victors were Selby and Australian Robertson.|$|E

2500|$|... "Let me shed a bit {{of light}} on things here. Martin and Frazer had this band called Hydra back in 84/85. The most {{impressive}} thing about the band {{was the fact that}} Frazer had already printed some 2 colour t shirts and he had a car! I met Frazer at a local Hell gig in Long Eaton and it turned out they were thinking of getting a second guitarist. I heard a tape (which I still have, it's priceless) of a show they did in a pub in Nottingham and decided to have a jam as I was wanting to get some experience playing, after all I was the ripe old age of 15. Hell, two weeks after I joined, the original guitarist quit (i think this was on the cards) and the drummer left (thankfully) after we did our first demo a couple of months later, I think due to me having a go about his girlfriend being in the studio (you see, good work ethic back then!). It was Tim Bowler (the drummer from Hell) who introduced us to Simon Negus. The name Sabbat came from a book on witchcraft, but I actually found some old school books of mine with ideas doodled on them so I'm <b>sure</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> some doing in suggesting it, but I do remember we liked the way the word looked in the scrawly type of writing so we went with it. Yeah the flexi disc for white dwarf was an odd one, John Blanche, the art editor painted our first cover so it all came about quite easy, it does sound shockingly bad though." ...|$|E

"I am <b>sure,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> {{no wish to}} {{separate}} from my child"--so Mrs. Willoughby always spoke of, and so she always felt towards Maud--"I am <b>sure,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> no wish {{to separate}} from my child; but as we cannot always remain, it is perhaps better this one should marry, like the other. There is young Verplanck much devoted to her; he is everyway a suitable match; and then he is in Evert's own regiment." ...|$|R
