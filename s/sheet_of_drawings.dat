40|$|Nine Quarter City The {{project for}} second {{semester}} advances {{the themes of}} assemblage and transformation from first semester, but with greater emphasis on the generation of a single architectural proposal in a complex urban context. It commences at an urban scale. A ‘generic city’ of strict geometry has been fused with 9 actual cities (Dubrovnik, Madrid, Isfahan, Tunis, Tokyo, Bern, Venice, Jerusalem and New York) to create 9 distinct ‘quarters’ which are nevertheless woven into an overall urban order that is stabilized by two major diagonal axes, one water and one land. Each studio group is allocated a different ‘quarter’ of the city comprising 16 adjacent blocks. A figure-ground plan (built form represented as black, and open space as white) has been created and serves {{as the basis for}} the initial tasks that will be undertaken as a ‘conversation’ with the other members of your group. You are charged with elaborating on the basic plan, deciding on a range of buildings that your quarter of the city needs, then deciding on a specific program for your allocated city block and developing a concrete architectural proposal for one building on your block. The work should be seen as a series of transformations based on an understanding that all architecture (including one’s own) is constituted by other architecture, which one appropriates, reconfigures, transforms, and makes one’s own. Once again the projected will be conducted as a series of related exercises with an emphasis on practical experimentation. The work will be drawn together into a final presentation, comprising a well-crafted model and one A 1 <b>sheet</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawings</b> of an exhibition standard.

Education {{in the field}} of HVAC The subject of the project was comparison of Russian and Finnish {{educational systems}} of higher education {{in the field of}} HVAC. The system of higher education in Russia is represented by federal, municipal, and private universities and institutions. Higher education in Finland is provided by special institutions, vocational institutions, polytechnics, and universities.

40|$|The {{exhibition}} comprised 61 {{works on}} paper by Leonardo and five models based on his designs, accompanied {{by a series of}} computer-generated animations which combining words and images to demonstrate the way he worked things out. Our approach to the exhibition was to tackle how Leonardo thought on paper, an approach to presenting Leonardo’s work which has not been attempted in an exhibition before. Many <b>of</b> the <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawings</b> we selected are relatively unknown and have not been exhibited. This is because we selected works, which might be classed, as ‘difficult’, as they are filled with notes or diagrams and drawings not immediately understandable. Although we take for granted the surviving 6, 000 drawings and manuscripts, they were very unusual for the time. No one had used paper to think things out in this way. No one had taken notes, drawn analogies, and exercised lateral thinking to such a degree. We traced Leonardo’s thought processes by examining his words and images and presented them classified into in four groups. For example, the ‘Minds Eye’ described his interest in how we come to understand the world and how our knowledge of it is interpreted. The second section shows Leonardo’s deep interest in the microcosm and macrocosm, a view of the world, which he developed to a new and complex level. ‘Force’ described Leonardo’s study of movement, through the study of man and birds in action. ‘Making Things’ demonstrated some of the practical applications of his knowledge from furnaces to set designs for theatrical presentations. A book to accompany the exhibition was written by Martin Kemp. The exhibition was attended by 120, 000 visitors, a high number for the V&A and for this kind of exhibition.

40|$|The archetypal Renaissance figure Leonardo da Vinci {{was truly}} a {{universal}} man (Ital. – uomo universale). There is no area of human activity that failed to attract his attention, or that does not bear a trace of his deliberations. In the field of fine art, Leonardo is famous for his masterpieces: the Mona Lisa, the Last Supper, the Virgin of the Rocks, and other, unfinished works, for example, St. Jerome in the Wilderness, and the Adoration of the Magi. He did not leave any works of sculpture, though he did create sketches and drawings. His legacy includes approximately 13, 000 <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> notes and <b>drawings</b> <b>of</b> anatomy, architecture, war and flying machines, plants and animals, all annotated in a reversed mirror-script. In his works of art, he brought his compositions to perfection by using the principles of perspective and the techniques of chiaroscuro and sfumato. Leonardo designed war machines and produced several plans and topographical maps for the powerful men of his time, under whose patronage he worked, such as dukes, kings and popes. This article presents a brief account of his most famous cartographical works: the plan of Imola, three topographic maps of Tuscany, the Chiana valley, the Pontine Marshes and western Tuscany, and a world map (Mappa Mundi).

40|$|Analizom triju projektnih zadataka uz objavljivanje stotinjak nacrta iznose se nove spoznaje o trogirskoj klasicističkoj arhitekturi. Zahvaljujući naručiteljima, obitelji Garagnin, za Trogir početkom XIX. stoljeća rade arhitekti G. Selva i B. Mazzoli. Nadopunjuje se opseg i sadržaj Selvinih, te po prvi put donose Mazzolijevi arhitektonski projekti za Garagnine. Interpretira se tijek projektiranja preoblikovanja sklopa palače Garagnin, od uputa naručitelja I. L. Garagnina do rješenja Selve i Mazzolija. Drugu temu predstavljaju novootkriveni projekti za preoblikovanje palače Cega kod južnih gradskih vrata, također za obitelj Garagnin, od kojih se jedan pripisuje Mazzoliju. Trećom se analizom Mazzoliju atribuira i poznati prijedlog obnove gradske lože, pa proizlazi da se njegovo projektiranje za Trogir može mjeriti s onim za Zadar i Split. At the {{beginning}} of the 19 th century, Giannantonio Selva and Basilio Mazzoli, important names in Neo-Classicist architecture, were making designs for the Trogir Garagnin family. The scope of Selva’s architectural work for the Garagninis has been partially discussed to date, but that of Mazzoli is completely unknown. Their drawings, which we include, are unsigned; they constitute a part of the creative process, mapping out the way between the desires of the client and the architects’ final plans. Thanks to the ample archival material and the identifiability of the architectural styles, this work has been able to put their drawings in a chronological sequence and according to authors. The designs at issue relate to the remodelling of the complex of the Garagnin Palace by the northern city gate, and to the renovation of the Cega Palace at the southern city gate on the Trogir waterfront. A third topic is the design for the reconstruction of the city loggia in the main piazza of Trogir. Important additional persons show up within the course of the architectural cogitations of Selva and Mazzoli. Earlier on it was completely unknown that subsequent ideas for the Garagnin Palace complex to Selva’s designs had been given by the architect Andrea Rigato, previously not known for his work in Dalmatia. The investigation has brought out the role of the client, Ivan Luka Garagnin, who guided the designers {{in the direction of the}} solutions he wanted with his own drawings. We have also established that basic plans were drawn up to ideas by Ivan Luka Garagnin by the surveyor Ivan Danilo. Smaller designs for part of the family palace were done by Giovanni Printz, and one design for the Cega Palace was drawn by the many-faceted surveyor Ivan Miotto, who also worked as botanist and architect. It is a happy circumstance that the drawings are accompanied by letters that have been of assistance in a more complete insight, arrived at via a comparison with the <b>drawings</b> and analysis <b>of</b> them. Finding a large amount of unsigned letters from the Garagnin-Fanfogna Fonds in the Trogir City Museum, we first of all divided them according to sites, and then arranged them into sequences according to the way given ideas were worked out in architectural terms. When these sequences were once established, it became clear that there were several different hands inside the same design process, even within individual drawings. Having established this division of labour, it was then necessary to identify the artists. Then we started a comparative analysis <b>of</b> <b>drawings</b> and the research into the written documents and additional sketches from the Garagnin-Fanfogna Family Archive in the State Archives in Split, in addition to books from the Garagnin- Fanfogna Library in Trogir. This helped in determining the time when the drawing was created. Analysis of the manner of drawing and writing, kind of pa 436 per and dimensions <b>of</b> <b>drawings,</b> was accompanied by computer enlargement of the details and overlaying <b>of</b> the <b>drawings</b> with renderings <b>of</b> the existing state of the site, and with each other. The result of this work is an attempt at the attribution and dating of a hundred or so unpublished <b>sheets</b> <b>of</b> <b>drawings</b> and sketches from the great family archive. As well as this, additional drawings and documents related to the topic of the work are given. In the first analysis, the course of the design of the renovation of the Garagnin Palace complex is explained – from the instructions of client Ivan Luka Garagnin to the designs of Selva and Mazzoli, what was actually built from their designs has also been determined. Many of the features that were planned are reconstructed from the drawings and written documents. A second analysis is based on a new fact about the commissioning of designs for the reconstruction of the Cega Palace, by the Garagnin family, via two designs, one of which we can unhesitatingly attribute to Mazzoli. In a third analysis, a known design for the reconstruction of the loggia in the main Trogir piazza is also identified as Mazzoli’s work, and after this understanding has been arrived at, it is possible to compare his work in Trogir with his activities in Zadar and Split...|$|R
