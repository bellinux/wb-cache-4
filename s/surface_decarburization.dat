40|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>decarburization</b> of high silicon {{spring steel}} in ambient air was studied. The {{experimental}} results confirmed the decarburized mechanism under AC 1 temperature, in the temperature range of AC 1 -AC 3 and AC 3 -G. Under AC 1 temperature, pearlite spheroidization and <b>surface</b> <b>decarburization</b> {{are carried out}} simultaneously and pearlite spheroidization is reinforced. Considering the oxidation loss depth, the “true ferrite decarburized depth” at 850 °C (AC 3 -G) is still smaller than that at 760 °C (AC 1 -AC 3). That is because an “incubation period” must pass away before ferrite decarburization occurs in the temperature range of AC 3 -G, and the ferrite decarburized rate is limited to being equal to the partial decarburized rate...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{consequences}} of <b>surface</b> finish and <b>decarburization</b> on the fatigue performance of cast and forged steel {{components in the}} railway industry is substantial, and means that fatigue cracking is an ongoing issue across the industry. Examples of loading spectra for coupler forces and track loads are presented, along with data from past investigations showing the severe penalty in terms of fatigue life caused by inadequate surface finish at critical locations of components under fatigue loads. Managers in railway industry {{need to understand the}} technical case for increased manufacturing requirements, as costs from operational losses may well have made the economic case for increased requirements more compelling. Various options for improving the surface finish at critical locations that are prone to fatigue are available, and should be explored to reduce the vulnerability of these components to failure via fatigue cracking...|$|R
40|$|A {{homogenous}} {{intensity distribution}} along the cube texture fibre {{is important to}} achieve an easy magnetization in non-oriented electrical steels. Several alternatives have been discussed in literature {{to achieve this goal}} namely, tertiary recrystallization (<b>surface</b> energy controlled), <b>decarburization</b> annealing, two step cold rolling (strain induced boundary migration), twin-roll thin strip casting (directional solidification), phase transformation (surface energy anisotropy) and columnar grains formation (selective grain growth). In the present study, a hypoeutectic Al-Si alloy was deposited on the surface of cold rolled Fe-Si steels with a hot dipping simulator and subsequently annealed at 1000 °C for different times. This procedure was developed previously in order to enrich the substrate with Al and/or Si and consequently improve their resistivity. Of specific interest was the formation of columnar grains in the low Fe-Si steel after annealing. These columnar grains were found to grow from the surface towards the centre of the substrate. The microstructure and texture in the columnar grains were significantly different than those {{in the middle of the}} material. Therefore, the evolution of these features during processing was studied in detail in this work...|$|R
40|$|Using coating on the {{hot forming}} steel can {{effectively}} avoid the surface defects such as <b>surface</b> oxidation and <b>decarburization</b> in the thermoforming process, and make the workpiece have {{a certain degree of}} corrosion resistance after molding. This paper studies the effect of the variation of microstructure and heat treatment process in the heating process of 22 MnB 5 hot forming steel with Zn plating layer on coating microstructure and properties. The microstructure and morphology of 22 MnB 5 with zinc based coatings by different pre-alloying and austenitizing technology are analyzed by SEM, EDS, and glow spectrum analyzer. The results show that under the same pre-alloying time, with the temperature improved, the coating's phases change from ζ phase, δ phase, Γ 1 phase and Γ phase to mainly Γ phase; under the same temperature, as the pre-alloying process time goes by, the contents of Fe gradually increases but Zn decreases, finally the Fe content could reach 88 %, and Zn reaches 8 % in the coating; the coating is almost all α-Fe (Zn) with only a small amount of Γ phase on the surface, and the thickness of the coating is about 12 μm; high quality coatings could be obtained under the pre-alloying process of heating at 550 ℃ for 30 min and austenitizing at 920 ℃ for 4 min. The result provides important reference for developing new hot forming steel coating...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. While {{predicting}} {{internal stresses}} in steels via Barkhausen Noise (BN) along with high sensitivity there exist several influencing factors, which arose uncertainties and falsify measurement results. These factors are micro structure, surface non uniformity, <b>surface</b> <b>decarburization,</b> etc. In this paper {{we deal with}} some new opportunities to minimize uncertainties in stress prediction. The first approach {{is based on the}} observation, that, while increasing the amplitude of a driving magnetic field, the BN appears step-wise at some “field of start ” (FoS) value. This value is approved to be weakly dependent on some influencing factors. The second approach is based on extracting a specific information about stresses from the diagrams of BN variation through angular and amplitude scanning of driving magnetic field value respectively. The experiments have been made using “Introscan ” analyzer...|$|E
40|$|<b>Surface</b> <b>decarburization</b> {{is one of}} {{important}} issues in spring steel production. The novel decarbonization-resistant nano-coating has been successfully fabricated, by using a low-cost, and easily accessible bauxite minerals and other additional components, including magnesia, silicon carbide, glass powder and agglomerant, {{which is used to}} prevent spring steels from being decarburized during the hot-rolling process. The microstructure of the protective nano-coating is observed by means of X-ray diffraction, TG-DTA, metalloscope and so on. It is found that even if some glass ceramic exists within the coating in the initial lower temperature (950 degrees C similar to 1000 degrees C) the decarbonization-preventing coating still presents decarburization resistance up to 72. 2 %. Furthermore, the protective ration reaches to 100 % when the heating temperature rises to range (1050 degrees C similar to 1100 degrees C). The excellent decarbonization preventing properties are attributed to the formation of glass ceramic and pleonaste, which hinders the second interdiffusion of oxygen and carbon...|$|E
40|$|Introduction {{and current}} state of the problem. Common and {{undesirable}} defects in microstructures include <b>surface</b> <b>decarburization</b> which compromises the quality of HC wire rods hot-wound into coils (coil rod) and performance of products made there from. Resistance of metal to alternating loads is determined by the depth of the decarburized layer, i. e. actual difference between surface microstructure and base metal structure. As we know [1, 2], for decarburization process to occur on the metal surface when heated in a furnace, the gaseous atmosphere shall not produce a very strong oxidizing effect. If the rate of oxidation is higher than that of carbon diffusion in steel, it enhances scale build-up whereby oxygen can oxidize both carbon and iron. Although decarburized layer is mostly deemed to be detrimental, {{it has been argued that}} decarburization of wire rod surface can be advantageous to useful qualities of wire rods. Soft decarburized surface ensures improved flextural (bending) or torsional (twisting) dictility of metal resulting from low sensitivity to stress concentration factors, high resistance to crack propagation and higher corrosion resistance [3]. Compressive residual stresses occurring in a decarburized skin improve the fatigue life and increase the durability of steel-wire ropes [4]. Wire rods with more pronounced <b>surface</b> <b>decarburization</b> are less likely to form the hardened structures (martensite) in drawing operations due to surface cracking and cupping of the martensitic layer. However, in the process of cold drawing whereby metal is deformed by pulling wire rods through a serious of drawing dies (monolithic system), maximum stresses develop on the surface of rolled products[3 – 5]. Therefore uniform distribution of structure on the surface and in the boundary layers is essential. This means that minimum and uniform depth of decarburization on the metal surface is a prerequisite for the production of high-quality HC rolled stock [3 – 7]. The paper [11] acknowledges the influence of micro-additives of boron on changes in the austenite grain size and accordingly the length of borders in high-carbon steels with austenitizing temperature increase within the range of 900 … 1 100 ºС. The purpose of work is to research the effect of austenite grain size on the decarburization depth in carbon (base) steel and boron micro-alloyed steel...|$|E
40|$|Tests were {{conducted}} {{in order to determine}} the effect of <b>surface</b> <b>decarburization</b> on the notch sensitivity and rate of fatigue crack propagation in 12 MoV stainless-steel sheet at room temperature. Three specimen configurations were utilized in the course of the investigation: standard tensile specimen, 9 -inch-wide specimens containing fatigue cracks or thread-cut notches of 0. 005 -inch radius, and 2 -inch-wide specimens containing fatigue cracks. The 12 MoV stainless-steel sheet in the normal condition was found to have an ultimate tensile strength of 251 ksi and to be extremely notch sensitive. The material in the decarburized condition was found to have an ultimate tensile strength of 210 ksi and to be considerably stronger than the normal material in the presence of fatigue cracks. Decarburization did not appear to have any significant influence on the rate of fatigue crack propagation in the 2 -inch-wide specimens at the stress levels considered. In addition to the tests, two methods for predicting residual static strength and their application to the material are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A clear {{transition}} in the tensile ductility behavior {{has been observed}} for grain sizes D {{in the range of}} 15 μm - 20 μm (1. 50 μm ≤ D < 50 μm) in a 22 % Mn, 0. 6 % C (in mass %) TWIP steel. This behavior is a combination of the intrinsic effect of grain size D on strength and work hardening rate of the material, with an extrinsic effect, superficial decarburization and Mn depletion processes occurred during annealing treatments at T ≥ 1000 ºC. In the present work, this extrinsic effect happened in TWIP steel has been studied in depth. GDOES (Glow Discharge Optical Emission Spectrometry) analyses have been carried out in order to study quantitatively the C and Mn concentration profiles. The depth of <b>surface</b> <b>decarburization</b> has been modeled by using Birks-Jackson theory. Two micro-constituents have been observed via Ferritoscope into decarburized volume: α’-martensite and α-austenite. The ductility of coarse-grained TWIP steel, subjected for high annealing temperatures and long annealing times, declines {{as a consequence of the}} formation of α’-martensite and less stable α-austenite with lower stacking fault energy, SFE, due to the Mn depletion in the decarburized volume...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSteel alloys are the {{material}} that is most used in protective constructions today. The reason is the overall good properties of steels, with its high strength and hardness, high ductility, high formability and relatively low cost compared to other materials. Even though armour steels are affordable, work is done to limit expenses from production or {{come up with new}} and less expensive alloys. Case hardening is a technique for production of steel with a very hard and durable surface while still maintaining a tough and ductile core. Case hardened products have hard, durable and fatigue resistant surfaces and tough and durable cores. Case hardening is typically applied to machine parts that are exposed to heavy wear and high loads such as gears, bearings, screws and nuts, shafts, etc	In 2010, Lou et al. managed to significantly increase the penetration resistance of a low-cost steel (NVE 36) by case hardening. Encouraged by this, Hans Magne Thorseth wrote his master s thesis Optimalisering av stål i beskyttelseskonstruksjoner in 2010. His attempt to improve the ballistic strength of Hardox 450 steel by case hardening did not have the desired results. The ballistic limit velocity was reduced from approximately 800 m/s for the original Hardox 450 to approximately 770 m/s for the case hardened steel. The probable reasons for the reduction of the ballistic limit velocity was a too low carbon content increase from the carburizing and thus a too low hardness increase, in addition to deterioration of the metal core properties from the heat treatment. The objective of this master s thesis was to improve the case hardening process used by Hans Magne Thorseth in his master s thesis. The improvement work was divided into two parts, a preliminary project work and this master thesis. The project was carried out in the autumn of 2010, and the aim was to find the optimum case hardening process to produce steel with improved ballistic properties. This involved testing of different carburizing potentials to increase the surface carbon content of the metal and to find carburizing heat treatments that would retain the core properties of the carburized steel. Based on the results from the preliminary project it seemed possible to produce case hardened steel with surface hardness over 1000 HV, but a slight reduction of core hardness was difficult to avoid. The present master s thesis was written during the spring of 2011. The key results from the preliminary project work were used to determine a range of case hardening courses. A total of 11 case hardening courses were tested, of which six courses employed carbon potential of 0. 9 % and five courses employed a carbon potential of 1. 1 %. Different hardening courses were tested, including direct hardening, a modified single hardening process and traditional and modified versions of double and triple hardening. Before the case hardening the plates were sandblasted to remove a corrosion-resistant primer that was applied to the plates. The primer was believed to limit the diffusion of carbon into the steel. In the preliminary project the primer was ground away and grinding was the preferred solution in this work as well, however, due to capacity issues sandblasting was employed. The ballistic limit velocity of the case hardened and the original Hardox 450 target plates were calculated from results obtained by ballistic experiments. The ballistic limit velocities of the case hardened samples, with approximately 787 m/s as the highest, were lower than that of the original Hardox 450, being approximately 800 m/s. 	Surface hardness measurements of the steel revealed a poor effect from the carburization, the hardest surface was measured at 735 HV. This could be explained by a probable <b>surface</b> <b>decarburization</b> of the original Hardox 450, which was discovered by microstructure examinations and hardness measurements. In contrary to in the preliminary project where this layer was ground away, the sandblasting did not remove the decarburized layer. Due to this, the case hardening did not have the desired effect on the steel surface, resulting in a too low surface hardness. 	The core hardness proved difficult to retain, the highest core hardness value obtained was below 460 HV, compared to the original Hardox 450 with core hardness of 475 HV. This could be another reason for the lower ballistic limit velocity of the carburized steel plates. However, the original Hardox 450 did not have the highest cross-sectional hardness integral value, so the ballistic properties probably also depend to some degree on ductility. A main reason for the superior ballistic limit velocity of the original Hardox 450 was therefore believed to be related to cracking of the rear side of the case hardened target plates during projectile penetration. The cracking seemed to be a result of the harder, and thus more brittle, outer surface layer...|$|E
