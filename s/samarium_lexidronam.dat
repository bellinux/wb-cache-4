5000|$|... 153Sm has a {{half-life}} of 46.3 hours, undergoing β− decay into 153Eu. As {{a component}} of <b>samarium</b> <b>lexidronam,</b> it is used in palliation of bone cancer. It is treated by the body {{in a similar manner}} to calcium, and it localizes selectively to bone.|$|E

50|$|<b>Samarium</b> (153Sm) <b>lexidronam</b> (chemical name Samarium-153-ethylene diamine {{tetramethylene}} phosphonate, abbreviated Samarium-153 EDTMP, {{trade name}} Quadramet) is a chelated complex of a radioisotope of the element samarium with EDTMP. It {{is used to}} treat pain when cancer has spread to the bone.|$|R
25|$|A major use of {{systemic}} radioisotope therapy {{is in the}} treatment of bone metastasis from cancer. The radioisotopes travel selectively to areas of damaged bone, and spare normal undamaged bone. Isotopes commonly used {{in the treatment of}} bone metastasis are strontium-89 and <b>samarium</b> (153Sm) <b>lexidronam.</b>|$|R
5|$|The major {{commercial}} {{application of}} samarium is in samarium–cobalt magnets, which have permanent magnetization {{second only to}} neodymium magnets; however, samarium compounds can withstand significantly higher temperatures, above , without losing their magnetic properties, due to the alloy's higher Curie point. The radioactive isotope samarium-153 is the active component of the drug <b>samarium</b> (153Sm) <b>lexidronam</b> (Quadramet), which kills cancer cells {{in the treatment of}} lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer and osteosarcoma. Another isotope, samarium-149, is a strong neutron absorber and is therefore added to the control rods of nuclear reactors. It is also formed as a decay product during the reactor operation {{and is one of the}} important factors considered in the reactor design and operation. Other applications of samarium include catalysis of chemical reactions, radioactive dating and an X-ray laser.|$|R
40|$|Bone pain {{associated}} with advanced prostate and other cancers {{is a frequent}} and significant complication, and the effective management of metastatic bone disease and accompanying symptoms continues {{to be one of}} the major problems facing patients and their physicians. Treatment is in part dependent on prior treatments; usually a combination of systemic and local modalities is used because no single treatment regimen is effective for an extended period of time. The 3 radionuclides currently approved for treatment of bone pain (phosphorus- 32, strontium- 89, and samarium- 153) are discussed in this review as viable treatment options, with emphasis on the third-generation agent in this category, <b>samarium</b> Sm 153 <b>lexidronam.</b> Clinical trial data are described that support the use of this agent in patients with hormone-refractory prostate cancer with painful metastatic bone disease, and the efficacy of and role for combination therapies are also discussed...|$|R
