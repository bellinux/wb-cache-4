5|$|Julian also {{extracted}} <b>stigmasterol,</b> {{which took}} {{its name from}} Physostigma venenosum, the west African calabar bean that he hoped could serve as raw material for synthesis of human steroidal hormones. At about this time, in 1934, Butenandt and Fernholz, in Germany, had shown that <b>stigmasterol,</b> isolated from soybean oil, could be converted to progesterone by synthetic organic chemistry.|$|E
5|$|In 1940 Julian {{was able}} to produce 100lb of mixed soy sterols daily, which had a value of $10,000 ($ today) as sex hormones. Julian was soon ozonizing 100 pounds daily of mixed sterol dibromides. The soy <b>stigmasterol</b> was easily {{converted}} into commercial quantities of the female hormone progesterone, and the first pound of progesterone he made, valued at $63,500 ($ today), was shipped to the buyer, Upjohn, in an armored car. Production of other sex hormones soon followed.|$|E
5|$|Sterol lipids, such as {{cholesterol}} and its derivatives, {{are an important}} component of membrane lipids, along with the glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelins. The steroids, all derived from the same fused four-ring core structure, have different biological roles as hormones and signaling molecules. The eighteen-carbon (C18) steroids include the estrogen family whereas the C19 steroids comprise the androgens such as testosterone and androsterone. The C21 subclass includes the progestogens as well as the glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. The secosteroids, comprising various forms of vitamin D, are characterized by cleavage of the B ring of the core structure. Other examples of sterols are the bile acids and their conjugates, which in mammals are oxidized derivatives of {{cholesterol and}} are synthesized in the liver. The plant equivalents are the phytosterols, such as β-sitosterol, <b>stigmasterol,</b> and brassicasterol; the latter compound is also used as a biomarker for algal growth. The predominant sterol in fungal cell membranes is ergosterol.|$|E
25|$|The pentacyclic triterpenoids ursolic {{acid and}} oleanolic acid have been {{extracted}} from Astianthus. So have cinnamic acid, p-methoxycinnamic acid, and <b>stigmasterol.</b>|$|E
25|$|Within {{soybean oil}} or the lipid {{portion of the}} seed is {{contained}} four phytosterols: <b>stigmasterol,</b> sitosterol, campesterol, and brassicasterol accounting for about 2.5% of the lipid fraction; and which can be converted into steroid hormones. Additionally soybeans are {{a rich source of}} sphingolipids.|$|E
500|$|Julian's {{research}} at Glidden changed direction in 1940 {{when he began}} work on synthesizing progesterone, estrogen, and [...] testosterone from the plant sterols <b>stigmasterol</b> and sitosterol, isolated from soybean oil by a foam technique he invented and patented. At that time clinicians were discovering many uses for the newly discovered hormones. However, only minute quantities could be extracted from hundreds of pounds of the spinal cords of animals.|$|E
500|$|Syntex {{reduced the}} cost of steroid {{intermediates}} more than 250-fold over twelve years, from $80 per gram in 1943 to $0.31 per gram in 1955. Competition from Upjohn and General Mills, which had together made very substantial improvements {{in the production of}} progesterone from <b>stigmasterol,</b> forced the price of Mexican progesterone to less than $0.15 per gram in 1957. [...] The price continued to fall, bottoming out at $0.08 per gram in 1968.|$|E
500|$|Percy Lavon Julian (April 11, 1899 – April 19, 1975) was an African American {{research}} chemist and {{a pioneer}} in the chemical synthesis of medicinal drugs from plants. He was the first to synthesize the natural product physostigmine, and {{a pioneer in}} the industrial large-scale chemical synthesis of the human hormones [...] progesterone and testosterone from plant sterols such as <b>stigmasterol</b> and sitosterol. His work laid the foundation for the steroid drug industry's production of cortisone, other corticosteroids, and birth control pills.|$|E
500|$|On April 13, 1949, {{rheumatologist}} Philip Hench at the Mayo Clinic {{announced the}} dramatic effectiveness of cortisone in treating rheumatoid arthritis. The cortisone {{was produced by}} Merck at great expense using a complex 36-step synthesis developed by chemist Lewis Sarett, starting with deoxycholic acid from cattle bile acids. On September 30, 1949, Julian announced an improvement {{in the process of}} producing cortisone. This eliminated the need to use osmium tetroxide, which was a rare and expensive chemical. [...] By 1950, Glidden could begin producing closely related compounds which might have partial cortisone activity. Julian also announced the synthesis, starting with the cheap and readily available pregnenolone (synthesized from the soybean oil sterol <b>stigmasterol)</b> of the steroid cortexolone (also known as Reichstein's Substance S), a molecule that differed from cortisone by a single missing oxygen atom; [...] and possibly 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and pregnenetriolone, which he hoped might also be effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis, but unfortunately they were not.|$|E
2500|$|Poppy {{seeds are}} notable for being {{especially}} high in tocopherols other than vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol). [...] Poppyseed oil from one source {{has been reported}} to contain 30.9mg gamma-tocopherol per 100 g. [...] It also contains alpha and gamma tocotrienols, but not others. [...] Compared to other vegetable oils, poppyseed oil has a moderate amount of phytosterols: [...] higher than soybean oil and peanut oil, lower than safflower oil, sesame oil, wheat germ oil, corn oil, and rice bran oil. [...] Sterols in poppyseed oil consist almost entirely of campesterol, <b>stigmasterol,</b> sitosterol and delta 5-avenasterol. [...] Poppyseed oil is high in linoleic acid. Although not generally higher than safflower oil, it can be as high as 74.5%. [...] Other triglycerides present in notable quantities are oleic acid and palmitic acid.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Stigmasterol</b> is {{also found}} in various vegetables, legumes, nuts, seeds, and unpasteurized milk. Pasteurization will {{inactivate}} <b>stigmasterol.</b> Edible oils contains higher amount than vegetables. [...] Phytosterols normally are broken down in the bile.|$|E
50|$|Two {{chemical}} compounds {{found in the}} plant are labellenic acid and beta-Sitosterol. As well, the plant contains oleanolic acid, 7-oxositosterol, 7-oxostigmasterol, 7alpha-hydroxy <b>stigmasterol,</b> <b>stigmasterol,</b> 5-hydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxy flavone, pillion, gonzalitosin I, tricin, cosmosin, apigenin-7-O-beta-D-(6-O-p-coumaryl)glucopyranoside, anisofolin A and luteolin.|$|E

50|$|Sitosterol and <b>stigmasterol</b> common {{compounds}} {{found in}} almost all plant species.|$|E
50|$|Total {{synthesis}} of β-sitosterol {{has not been}} achieved. However, β-sitosterol has been synthesized from <b>stigmasterol</b> 1, which involves a specific hydrogenation of the side-chain of <b>stigmasterol</b> (See Figure Below). The {{first step in the}} synthesis forms <b>stigmasterol</b> tosylate 2 from <b>stigmasterol</b> 1 (95% purity) using p-TsCl, DMAP, and pyridine (90% yield). The tosylate 2 then undergoes solvolysis as it is treated with pyridine and anhydrous MeOH to give a 5:1 ratio of i-stigmasterol methyl ether 3 (74% yield) to <b>stigmasterol</b> methyl ether 4, which is subsequently removed by chromatography. The hydrogenation step of a previously proposed synthesis involved the catalyst Pd/C and the solvent ethyl acetate. However, due to isomerisation during hydrolysis, other catalysts, such as PtO2, and solvents, such as ethanol, were tested. There was little change {{with the use of a}} different catalyst. Ethanol, however, prevented isomerisation and the formation of the unidentified impurity to give compound 5. The last step of the synthesis is deprotection of the β-ring double bond of 5 with p-TsOH, aqueous dioxane, and heat (80 °C) to yield β-sitosterol 6. The cumulative yield for the final two steps was 55%, and the total yield for the synthesis was 37%.|$|E
