If diet overlap did occur, it mainly involved prey species that are dominant in the surf zone of Belgian beaches, such as shrimps and mysids. These results suggest an opportunistic utilization by flatfish of the available food resources in surf zone ecosystems. Also, two strategically different feeding habits could be distinguished between the five flatfish <b>species.</b> <b>Turbot</b> and brill mainly fed on large, highly mobile prey (e. g. fish, mysids) and had a rather narrow prey spectrum, whereas plaice, dab and sole ate more benthic prey (e. g.

40|$|International audienceThis work {{assesses the}} present {{knowledge}} on Pacific oyster sperm biology {{in comparison to}} two marine fish <b>species</b> (<b>turbot</b> and seabass) whose sperm characteristics are well described. Sperm morphology mainly differs {{by the presence of}} an acrosome in Pacific oyster which is absent in both fish species. In turbot as in Pacific oyster, a sperm 'maturation process' along the genital tract is observed. Sperm motility is triggered by changes in osmolality for seabass and turbot and in pH for Pacific oyster. However, complementary factors are involved to maintain sperm immotile in the genital tract. Sperm movement duration is very long in Pacific oyster (20 - 24 h), compared to turbot (3 - 5 min) and seabass (40 - 50 s). A high capacity of ATP regeneration is observed in Pacific oyster sperm, sustained by the limited changes in its morphology observed {{at the end of the}} swimming phase. Then, the total distance covered by spermatozoa is very different among the studied species (seabass: 2 mm, turbot: 12 mm, Pacific oyster: 1 m). Considering the main characteristics of sperm movement, the three studied species can be separated in two groups: the sprint racer group (seabass: high velocity and short distance covered) and the marathonian racer one (Pacific oyster: low velocity but covering long distances). To an intermediate extent, turbot sperm belongs to the sprint racer group. Then, the two different sperm movement strategies observed in the three species, are compensated by the behaviour of the breeders...|$|E
40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to assess the pathogenicity of Enterococcus sp. strains isolated from diseased turbot for several fish <b>species</b> (<b>turbot,</b> salmon, trout, and seabream), {{as well as for}} mice. The intraperitoneal injection assays indicated that the tested strains showed host specificity for turbot, {{with a high degree of}} virulence (50 % lethal dose of 10 (4) cells per g of fish). The Spanish Enterococcus sp. isolates were nonpathogenic for the other fish species studied and for mice. The possible routes of infection were determined by bath exposure (with and without prior abrasion of the skin) and by intragastric inoculations with food and feces contaminated with the pathogen. The bath challenges indicated that the Enterococcus isolates were able to overcome the defense mechanisms present on the surface of the turbot only if the skin was abraded prior to the exposure. The antibacterial activities of components of a glycoprotein nature present in the turbot skin mucus are probably responsible in part for the resistance in noninjured fish to infection. On the other hand, we demonstrated the capacity of this pathogen to overcome adverse conditions in the stomachs of fish when associated with food or fecal material, since it is able to establish an infective state and to produce mortalities after 16 to 20 days postingestion. From all of these findings, we can conclude that horizontal transmissions through water and the fecal-oral route are the main avenues of infection of turbot streptococcosis...|$|E

40|$|First paragraph: Since {{the first}} report of an {{outbreak}} of a streptococcal infection in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) in Japan in 1958 (Hoshina, Sano, & Morimoto, 1958), streptococcosis {{has been responsible for}} significant mortalities resulting in considerable losses to the aquaculture industry (Noga, 2010; Salati, 2006). Numerous species from the family Streptococcaceae have been identified as aetiological agents of streptococcosis in fish (Noga, 2010; Salati, 2006; Toranzo, Magariños, & Romalde, 2005), susceptibility to which was documented in both food (Inglis, Roberts, & Bromage, 1993) and ornamental fish species (Russo, Mitchell, & Yanong, 2006). Streptococcus parauberisis a coccoid, non-motile, alpha-haemolytic Gram-positive bacterium belonging to theStreptococcaceafamily (Nho etal., 2011) and has been reported as the aetiological agent of streptococcosis in a few fish <b>species,</b> including <b>turbot</b> (Scophthalmus maximus), olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus), sea bass (Sebastes ventricosus) and striped bass (Morone saxatilis) (Baeck, Kim, Gomez, & Park, 2006; Domeénech etal., 1996; Haines etal., 2013; Mata etal., 2004; Oguro etal., 2014; Park etal., 2009).

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{describe}} a novel flow-through respirometer with automated and semi-continuous detection of key water variables. The recirculating aquaculture system was designed to house aquatic organisms in culture-like conditions and allow long-term, high-precision measurements. Nine respirometry tanks (250 L in volume each) housed animals, and a tenth (without animals) acted as a reference tank. A single measurement unit made sequential measurements of each tank to eliminate the problem of sensor variation associated with multi-probe setups. The accuracy of the analyzers in relation to measurement range was: O- 2 = 1 %; CO 2 < 1 %; NH 3 = 2 %; temperature <= 0. 25 %; and pH +/- 0. 01. Dissolved CO 2 was measured using air-water equilibration coupled with non-dispersive infrared detection of carrier gas, and NH 3 was quantified using a reagent-based assay and spectophotometric autoanalyzer. Though expensive and not common in aquaculture or physiology research, these two automated metabolite analyzers could operate in both fresh and seawater, and offered high precision and accuracy. We report {{on the performance of}} these instruments for aquaculture research in two trials using a freshwater (rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss) and seawater fish <b>species</b> (<b>turbot,</b> Scophthalmus maximus). One of the main constraints imposed by the sequential measurement of multiple tanks was the measurement frequency of each tank. In the aforementioned system, NH 3 analyzes took the longest (12 min), followed by CO 2 (7 min), O- 2 (6 min), and pH (3 mm). (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Vitellogenin (Vg), the {{estrogen}} inducible protein {{precursor to}} egg yolk, {{serves as an}} indicator of exposure to estrogen mimicking environmental contaminants. Vg was isolated by size exclusion and ion exchange chromatography from plasma of California halibut (Paralichthys californicus) treated with estrogen. MALDI TOF mass spectrometry (MS) analysis resulted in a molecular mass of 188 kDa. MS/MS de novo sequencing provided evidence that California halibut has more than one form of Vg. Similar analysis on white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontamus) Vg did not reveal adequate evidence to suggest that sturgeon has more than one Vg. The potential of using other MS methods to understand the structure and function of Vg are discussed. An ELISA for measurement of California halibut plasma Vg was optimized and validated using a commercially available antibody developed for another flatfish <b>species,</b> <b>turbot.</b> Inclusion of overnight preincubation was critical for low detection limits. Increasing the amount of Tween- 20 to 0. 05 % in buffers was most effective for improving recoveries of spiked plasma samples. At the IC 50, the average recovery of spiked plasma samples was 104 % and the interplate CV was 12 %. The working range of the assay was 33 - 1000 ng/mL, while the detection limit in a plasma sample is 2. 2 µg/mL. The response to the model compounds 17 beta-estradiol and/j-nonylphenol show that this is a suitable model for further studies of estrogen mimicking contaminants. White sturgeon are native to the Sacramento River and subject to agricultural, municipal and industrial waste water effluents that likely contain different classes of endocrine-disrupting contaminants. Reductions in 17 beta-estradiol-induced vitellogenin levels were observed in white sturgeon co-injected with beta-naphthoflavone (BNF, 50 mg/kg), an Ah receptor agonist. The inhibition was maximal when the compounds were injected simultaneously versus prior treatment offish with BNF. This timing of the effect compared to increases in ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity suggests that the effect is not directly due to enhanced estrogen metabolism by the Ah receptor-induced enzymes. Results of this study will be relevant for those with monitoring programs who measure vitellogenin, as {{it is important to understand}} how Ah (dioxin) receptor active environmental contaminants can influence this endpoint...|$|E
40|$|Commercial {{flatfish}} {{captured in}} demersal fisheries {{along the west}} coast of Ireland include quota species such as plaice (Pleuronectes platessa L), in addition to high value non-quota <b>species,</b> <b>turbot</b> (Psetta maxima L.) and brill (Scophthalmus rhombus L.). Important non-commercial angling species of interest include flounder (Platichthys flesus L.). However, knowledge of the population dynamics of these flatfishes along {{the west coast of}} Ireland is lacking, and considered to be inadequate for the establishment of any population trends. In light of this, habitats along the west coast of Ireland serving as nursery grounds for the juveniles of these species were investigated (2000 - 2009). Correctly distinguishing between pairs of recently settled flatfish species, which are morphologically similar in appearance, was a prerequisite to this research. Counts of the meristic characters, fin rays, which are species specific, proved to be a reliable identification tool for juveniles. Plaice were the most abundant flatfish species present on nursery grounds, followed by turbot, {{and to a lesser extent}} brill. Assessment of nursery grounds over the eight year period, revealed both inter-annual and spatial variability in the relative abundance, growth, and condition of plaice, turbot and brill. Certain trends were revealed in these parameters, indicating the existence of both high and low quality nursery habitats. Abundances of both plaice and turbot on nursery grounds were negatively correlated with sea water temperatures during the pelagic stage. Baseline data on the timing of critical events, including hatching, larval durations, and settlement, in addition to growth experienced during early life, were established from the otolith microstructure of turbot. Post-settlement growth rate estimates of turbot also indicated certain locations as high quality nurseries. The feeding ecology of juvenile turbot and brill on nursery grounds was described, with temporal and resource partitioning revealed, implying that competition is unlikely to arise between these two morphologically similar species. A high incidence of prey was observed in the gut content of all turbot and brill, suggesting that food was not limited on Irish nursery grounds. Turbot fed on a much wider range of prey in contrast to brill, which fed almost exclusively on one prey organism. This observation may be one reason for the general sparse distribution of brill. The improved understanding of the early life history of plaice, turbot and brill may aid in the development and implementation of effective management strategies in the future; at the very least for the protection of important nursery grounds, as any loss, or decline in the quantity or quality of these areas, will undoubtedly have a negative impact on the recruitment of these species...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{elucidate}} the transmission and dispersion routes {{used by the}} myxozoan parasite Enteromyxum scophthalmi Palenzuela, Redondo et Alvarez-Pellitero, 2002 within its host (Scophthalmus maximus L.), a detailed study of the course of natural and experimental infections was carried out. Purified stages obtained from infected fish were also used in in vitro assays with explants of uninfected intestinal epithelium. The parasites can contact and penetrate loci in the intestinal epithelium very quickly. From there, they proliferate and spread {{to the rest of}} the digestive system, generally in an antero-posterior pattern. The dispersion routes include both the detachment of epithelium containing proliferative stages to the intestinal lumen and the breaching of the subepithelial connective system and local capillary networks. The former mechanism is also responsible for the release of viable proliferative stages to the water, where they can reach new fish hosts. The finding of parasite stages in blood smears, haematopoietic organs, muscular tissue, heart and, less frequently, skin and gills, suggests the existence of additional infection routes in transmission, especially in spontaneous infections, and indicates the role of vascular system in parasite dispersion within the fish. The very high virulence of this <b>species</b> in <b>turbot</b> and the rare development of mature spores in this fish may suggest it is an accidental host for this parasite. This may also question the existence of a two-host life cycle involving an actinosporean stage in this species. Further studies are needed to clarify this open point of the life cycle.

40|$|A {{full-length}} clone of {{the growth}} hormone receptor (GHR) was isolated from a cDNA library constructed from the liver of black seabream (Acanthopagrus schlegeli). The seabream GHR (sbGHR) cDNA sequence encodes a transmembrane protein of 640 amino acids (aa) possessing the characteristic motifs and architectural design of GHRs of other species. When {{compared to the other}} fish GHRs, it is most homologous to another marine fish <b>species,</b> the <b>turbot,</b> where the aa identity is 79. 3 %. But the sbGHR sequence is more remotely related to the goldfish GHR (51. 6 % aa identity) and the salmonid GHRs (∼ 46 - 48 % aa identities). Phylogenetic comparison with other known GHRs indicates that the fish GHRs constitute a distinct group among the different vertebrate classes. The aa identities between sbGHR and other GHRs are low, being around 40 % with mammalian GHRs, around 45 % with avian and reptilian GHRs, and less than 35 % with Xenopus GHR. CHO cells transfected with the sbGHR cDNA can be stimulated to proliferate by recombinant seabream growth hormone (sbGH). In addition, the transfected cells can transactivate a co-expressed mammalian serine protease inhibitor (Spi) 2. 1 promoter upon stimulation by sbGH. These functional assays indicated that the fish receptor can interact with its homologous ligand to evoke the downstream post-receptor events. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and genomic PCR using a pair of gene-specific primers revealed the expression of two alternatively spliced forms of sbGHR in various tissues of the fish. A 93 -bp intron, unique to the sbGHR gene and not found in any other known GHR genes, is alternatively spliced to give rise to two forms of receptor mRNA transcripts. The two forms of the receptor are differentially expressed among the different tissues of the fish. © 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} morphology and sequenced {{nuclear and}} mitochondrial genes from 11 populations of a previously genetically unstudied "Baja California disjunct" <b>species,</b> the diamond <b>turbot</b> (Hypsopsetta guttulata). This species exhibits very limited adult movement and restriction to soft-bottom habitats {{but has a}} moderately long pelagic larval duration. Therefore, if pelagic larval duration is correlated with gene flow between Gulf of California and Pacific populations, we expect a reduced level of genetic and morphological differentiation. However, if adult habitat and ecology have more effect on gene flow, we expect the populations in the two bodies of water to be more highly differentiated. We used logistic regression to compare morphological features and phylogenetic and population genetic analyses to compare nucleotide sequence data. Gulf of California H. guttulata are different from Pacific populations in morphology and both mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences. MtDNA shows reciprocal monophyly, and nuclear sequences from the Gulf of California formed a monophyletic group. Population genetic analyses also suggest further population subdivision within the Pacific and within the Gulf of California.

In empirical terms we draw attention to the diplomatic efforts between the EU and Canada to overcome disagreements that led to war and to promote a cooperative agreement that would avoid the problem of overfishing on the High Sea. The rationale and substance of the 1995 UN Agreement on Transboundary Resources and Highly Migratory Species, its strengths and weaknesses, is presented and discussed.

40|$|As a {{contribution}} to the ecosystem approach to fisheries management, we estimated the effects of spawning closures on stock status, ecosystem impacts and economic performance. We focused on the flatfish fishery in the North Sea and explored how spawning closures for plaice and sole contribute to sustainable management of 4 target <b>species</b> (sole, plaice, <b>turbot</b> and brill). Seasonal patterns in fishing effort and catchability by age group and area were estimated to quantify the effect of different spawning closure scenarios on the selection pattern. The scenario performance was evaluated using indicators of stock status (spawning stock biomass), economic performance of the fishery (yield, revenue) and ecosystem impact (discards, bycatch of cod and rays, seabed integrity, fisheries-induced evolution). In a single-species context, spawning closures may be beneficial for the target species, while in a mixed fisheries and ecosystem context, negative effects may occur. A spawning closure for plaice combines positive effects on the plaice stock and the revenue with reductions of the negative impact for several ecosystem indicators and only a small negative effect on sea bed integrity. The effects did not differ when evaluated at current levels of effort or at maximum sustainable yield (MSY) effort. Tailor-made solutions are required that need to be developed in stakeholder consultation to trade-off the ecological and economic objectives.

Furthermore, the North Sea is used {{on a large scale}} for fisheries, military purposes and the extraction and suppletion of sand. Sand suppletion is used in the Netherlands to protect the beaches along the coast. In recent years, underwater sand levees or sand suppletion near shore has been performed for coastal protection. It has been suggested that new areas created as the result of sand suppletion offshore can create new opportunities for fish, because of an increase of the suitable habitat. In near future, major sand nourishments are planned at the Dutch coast of the Delfland area (‘zandmotor’). In order to study the effect on (mostly juvenile) fish and epifauna, a sampling strategy was designed to monitor the potentially affected species. The aim of this project is: to monitor the reference situation concerning fish and epifauna in the shallow coastal waters (2 - 7 m water depth); to monitor the reference situation concerning potential habitat for fish and epifauna in the shallow coastal waters (i. e. depth, grain size, water temperature, salinity, water visibility); and to link fish abundance to habitat characteristics.

40|$|Intensive {{aquaculture}} of Atlantic cod is fast {{developing in}} both Northern Europe and Canada. The {{last six years}} have seen major improvements in the larval rearing protocols and husbandry techniques for this species. Although breeding programmes are currently being developed by both governmental and private institutions in the main cod producing countries (i. e. Norway, Iceland and Canada), most hatcheries still rely on the mass spawning of their own broodstock. Mass spawning tanks are complex systems where fish are left to spawn naturally and fertilised eggs are collected with the overflowing water, {{with little or no}} control over the matings of the animals. Few published studies in other commercial marine <b>species</b> (i. e. <b>turbot</b> and sole) have attempted to analyse the output from such systems using microsatellite markers and several parentage analysis software programs. A review of these publications exposed a lack of consistency in the methods used to analyse such complex datasets. This problem was addressed by carrying out a detailed comparison of two analytical principals (i. e. assignment by strict exclusion and assignment by probabilities) and four parentage software programmes (i. e. FAP, VITASSIGN, CERVUS and PAPA), using the DNA profiles, at 5 loci, from 300 cod fry issued from the mass spawning of a large hatchery cod broodstock tank (consisting of 99 fish). This study revealed large discrepancies in the allocation outcomes between exclusion-based and probability-based assignments caused by the important rate of typing errors present in the dataset. Out of the four softwares tested, FAP (Taggart, 2007) was the most appropriate to use for handling such a dataset. It combined the most conservative method of assignment with the most informative output for the results displayed. In an attempt to study the breeding dynamics in a cod commercial hatchery, parental contributions to five groups of 300 fry (from five single days of spawning and from two commercial mass spawning cod tanks) were analysed, based on the genotyping data from eight loci.

40|$|The {{studies which}} form the {{background}} for this synoptic presentation aimed {{to contribute to}} the investigation of the reason for great yearly fluctuations in recruitment in marine fish stocks. In order to evaluate if mass mortality due to starvation in the larval stage contributes to these fluctuations, trypsin activity was suggested as an appropriate indicator to assess individually both the nutritional condition and feeding activity of fish larvae of all age stages. Based on the principle of conventional chromogenic methods a highly sensitive fluorometric measurement was developed, which allows the individual assessment of tryptic activity even in the youngest larval stages. In order to evaluate species-specific features of tryptic activity, larvae of six different marine species were reared under laboratory conditions (herring, Clupea harengus, turbot, Scophthalmus maximus, cod, Gadus morhua, sea bass, Dicentrarchus labrax, gilthead seabream, Sparus aurata, and Brazilian sardine, Sardinella brasiliensis). The exemplary application of the laboratory calibration in field surveys clearly demonstrates that the tryptic activity is appropriate to evaluate the nutritional condition of larvae from field samples. Examples for some species are presented (herring, cod and sprat). The most significant results from laboratory experiments: Larval age and larval size were chosen as the standard for comparison to relate to tryptic activity. Tryptic activity was found even in yolk sac stages of the investigated species. Tryptic activity increases with age in continuously fed larvae following a non-linear pattern which is supposed to be determined in the ontogenetic development of each species. Increase in tryptic activity persists until larvae develop a functional stomach. The amount of maximum tryptic activity at a given size and age is <b>species</b> specific: <b>turbot</b> larvae show the highest whereas herring larvae have the lowest values at a given age. The amount of trypsin which has its origin in the ingested food oganism is of minor significance for the measurement. Tryptic acticity reacts very sensitive on variations in food density. Not only fed and starved larvae can be separated but also larvae kept at high and low food concentration. Differences in tryptic activity between fed and starved larvae are statistically significant in the majority of the investigated species, but differences in larvae kept at high and low food densities are not always significant. In yolk sac stages and beyond, while adapting to exogenic food sources, differences in tryptic activity are insignificant in larvae with and without food supply. This stage can last until ten days after hatching, depending from the species. When relying completely on external food sources, differences in tryptic activity occurs within hours when fed and starving larvae are compared. However, significant differences arise only after 1 - 3 days, depending on species, size and age. Species with their origin in temperate latitudes shows a slower decrease in tryptic activity compared to species from subtropical or tropical areas. If food deprivation persists, tryptic activity levels off to zero within days; the number of days is depending from the species, age and size. Individual variability of tryptic activity is large in continuously fed larvae, moderate in larvae kept on low food density and disappears in starving larvae. A diurnal rhythm in tryptic activity was identified. In addition, tryptic activity increases as a consequence of active feeding and decreases thereafter within hours to the pre-feeding level; however, those level is always well above the tryptic activity level of starving larvae. Starving larvae show a very weak diurnal oscillation in tryptic activity. 196 Laboratory calibration was used to estimate the number of starving larvae in field samples. For this purpose, tryptic activity was related to the larval size and the values for starving larvae were fitted to a linear regression. The upper 99...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this thesis is to evaluate and optimize a stock enhancement program of natural population of flatfish in which artificially reared fish are released in coastal areas using turbot (Psetta maxima) as model. Biological and ecological criteria are developed to evaluate the likelihood for success, i. e. increasing the stock size, based on ecological knowledge. Special reference is given to processes involved in the regulation of the natural population, such as density-dependent and density-independent mortality and growth. Field data on the temporal and spatial variation in the abundance of age- 0 turbot is analyzed and implications for stock enhancement are discussed. It is concluded {{that there is a}} solid theoretical background indicating that stock enhancement through releases of artificially reared juvenile individuals is a viable option for the turbot stock. Support for the hypothesis that stock enhancement is a viable option is provided by the results of a series of filed experiments conducted under a stock enhancement program {{in the southern part of}} Denmark. The focus of these experiments was on the growth and mortality of released fish in comparison to wild fish, and the importance of the characteristics of the release habitat. The growth of the released fish was similar to, or higher than, that of their wild counterparts, and the mortality, even though highly variable, was on a comparable level. No indication of replacement of the wild individuals with released ones was found. The importance of the release habitat was investigated by releasing turbot into three areas that differed in wind exposure. The area with the highest degree of wind-exposure was, as predicted, the area where the highest abundance of wild juvenile turbot was found. The highest growth of released individuals was not found in this area but was found in the one characterized by the lowest degree of wind-exposure, an atypical nursery ground for turbot. The effect of the release habitat on the growth could be related to the quality of the prey items observed in the stomachs of wild turbot sampled in the three areas. Besides the choice of a suitable release habitat, the release size of the fish and the conditioning to the release habitat was shown to be critical for survival of released fish. In order to study the mortality of the released fish, a methodology applying diffusion theory was developed and tested. Using this method the post-release mortality was found to be as high as 14 %•day– 1 for the 9 day period examined in 7. 5 cm sized fish. Mortality decreased with increasing release size and became negligible at a release size of 17 cm. After conditioning reared fish to the release environment allowing fish to develop their natural burrowing behavior prior to release, the post-release mortality was found to be insignificant. Since it was possible to enhance the turbot stock through releases of artificially breed individuals, stock enhancement may be considered as a supplement to traditional stock management. It can be applied in <b>species</b> with a <b>turbot</b> like life cycle where density-dependent regulation occurs early in life, and where the cost of production young fish is less than the gain in fisheries yield. As long as the artificially reared juveniles are added to the population after the stage where density-dependent regulation occurs, it can be expected that the released fish will contribute to the natural stock. Further, in order to optimize the outcome when stock enhancing, two aspects should be given special attention, 1) finding a proper release habitat where not only the food quantity but also its quality provides optimal growth conditions and 2) the risk of a server loss of fish during the post release period which can be avoided either by manipulating the size of the individuals released or by applying a conditioning period prior to the release...|$|R
40|$|In 1883, Thomas Huxley {{put forward}} {{that all the}} great sea {{fisheries}} are inexhaustible. This illustrates the classical notion that marine environments tend to be demographically open without any chance of complete extinction. Such belief {{was based on the}} wide distribution of many marine species with extensive larval and adult dispersal, and large population sizes, even after heavy exploitation. However, the classical view of inexhaustible fisheries has proven incorrect after major declines in many world fisheries the last decades, prompting for a better understanding of fishery stock demography and connectivity using multidisciplinary approaches. Fisheries research has gained from the integration of genetic studies showing the various mechanisms explaining the evolution of population structure in the ocean. The resilience of fish populations and the maintenance of genetic diversity has important implications for the viability and stability of entire ecosystems under heavy exploitation. In this thesis, I aim at integrating novel knowledge on the genetic composition of flatfish stocks with fisheries management tools. Therefore, the genetic structure was investigated of the flatfish turbot and brill, in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean. A combination of conventional population genetic analyses and multivariate statistics was used to assess how environmental factors influence the genetic variation at various spatio-temporal scales. The focus was on several flatfish species with a synchronic sampling design. The seascape genetic approach made it possible to identify the interaction between oceanography and species-specific traits, and their effect on the true dispersal of the species. In the case of turbot, the combination of anonymous and gene-based nuclear markers proved useful for elucidating potential population units as each shows a different level of differentiation. This approach is highly valuable from a conservation perspective, as it allows one to infer the effect of community-wide fragmentation. Common geographic patterns were identified in the genetic structure. However, differences in sensitivity to gene flow barriers were reported. This discrepancy was driven by species-specific traits, particularly reproductive behavior. Within the Northeast Atlantic Ocean, I could distinguish two large groups: one comprising the Skagerrak-Kattegat area and a second along the Irish shelf. For turbot, another population might even be present in the Baltic Sea. Seascape genetic analyses based on putatively selective markers suggest an additional gene flow barrier within the North Sea, linked to the Friesian frontal zone. For a <b>species</b> like <b>turbot,</b> with a wider distribution range in the North Sea than flatfish such as sole and brill, the identification of this barrier has an important implication for the delineation of management units. At present, the incorporation of genetic data into statistical fisheries models has been limited. This is mainly because genetic research draws inferences about populations on an evolutionary time scale, while fisheries management is more interested in short-term demographic independence. Fisheries models usually lead management instruments towards short-term gains. But the long-term vision of sustainable fisheries management also needs to take evolutionary consequences into account. Our findings suggest that turbot could serve as a so-called umbrella species, i. e. a vulnerable species whose environmental requirements encapsulate the needs of most other species. It represents a foundation for appropriately managing seascapes in order to preserve diversity. Using turbot for that purpose has two advantages: 1) the impact of environmentally driven connectivity is most straightforward in turbot, and 2) turbot seems most vulnerable to the negative effects of fisheries and can therefore serve as the proverbial canary in the coal mine  an indicator of declining environmental quality. This implies that policymakers will have to make trade-offs to serve all marine stakeholders in the best possible way without jeopardising the long-term gains. Scientists can help to address these trade-offs. They can {{meet the needs of the}} stakeholders by communicating scientific results on all administrative levels as well as informing policy-makers of these results and the impact they may have on the ecosystem. Scientific research results are normally communicated via peer-reviewed publications and participation in conferences. At the same time, scientists must communicate through their national fisheries institutes, because these institutes play a key role in communicating between politicians, stakeholders and scientists. Such a communication strategy would not only transfer knowledge but will also help to tackle the problems related to a mismatch between the knowledge produced and the knowledge that policymakers actually need. Finally, it has become clear in recent years that unexpected management outcomes stem from human behavior related to uncertainty. The ecosystem is not yet sufficiently understood, and it shall never be completely understood because of its inherent variability and associated uncertainties. To address and reduce uncertainty, managers will have to incorporate information about resource user behavior provided by the social sciences. Such information depends largely on improved interdisciplinary communication among scientists. Often uncertainty in scientific results is reduced via the peer review process for high-level journals, usually restricted to a specific field. By expanding research to involve other disciplines and increasing efforts to improve communication between scientists and other actors, more and better knowledge will be produced and uncertainty will be further reduced. The ICES structure and workflow play a crucial role in creating an atmosphere for trans- and multi-disciplinary research. Working in a transnational context to stimulate interdisciplinary research and communication will encourage rapid and sure progress towards improved sustainability of sea fisheries. <w:latentstyles deflockedstate="false" defunhidewhenused="true"  <w:lsdexception="" locked="false" priority=" 0 " semihidden="false"  Table of contents Summary Samenvatting Abbreviations and definitions Chapter 1 General introduction and aims 1 Part I Chapter 2 Fylogeography of two congeneric species 27 Chapter 3 Regional Environmental pressure influences population differentiation in turbot 55 Chapter 4 Evaluating common environmental and biological drivers of population structure in commercial flatfish species 85 Part II Chapter 5 Global fisheries management 119 Chapter 6 Reform of the CFP and likely changes after revision of the Council and Parliament 157 Chapter 7 Why is the current management so challenging? 171 Chapter 8 The role of science 189 Chapter 9 General Discussion 199 Supplementary information 219 References 255 nrpages: 304 status: publishe...|$|R
