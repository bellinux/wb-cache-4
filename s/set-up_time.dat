25|$|Sea shanties are {{a type of}} work song {{traditionally}} sung by sailors. Derived {{from the}} French word 'chanter', meaning 'to sing', they may date from {{as early as the}} 15th century, but most recorded examples derive from the 19th century. Shanties were usually slow rhythmic songs designed to help with collective tasks on labour-intensive sailing and later steam ships. Many were call and response songs, with one voice (the shantyman) singing a lead line {{and the rest of the}} sailors giving a response together. There were derived from varied sources, including dances, folk songs, polkas, waltzes and even West African work-songs. Since different songs were useful for different tasks they are traditionally divided into three main categories, short haul shanties, for tasks requiring quick pulls over a relatively short time; halyard shanties, for heavier work requiring more <b>set-up</b> <b>time</b> between pulls; and Capstan shanties, for long, repetitive tasks requiring a sustained rhythm, but not involving working the lines. Famous shanties include, the 'Drunken Sailor' and 'Blow the Man Down'. There was some interest in sea shanties in the first revival from figures like Percy Grainger. In the second revival A. L. Lloyd attempted to popularise them, recording several albums of sea songs from 1965.|$|E

40|$|Findings {{from recent}} {{implementations}} of Workload Control (WLC) {{have called for}} research to investigate how sequence-dependent <b>set-up</b> <b>times</b> can best be handled within {{the design of the}} concept. In response, this study assesses the performance of four of the best-performing release methods from the literature in a job shop with sequence-dependent <b>set-up</b> <b>times</b> by simulation. First, the four methods are compared without considering set-up requirements at release. Second, the methods are refined to consider set-up requirements before being compared against the original methods. A release method that combines continuous and periodic release emerges as the best-performing method. Findings further suggest that considering set-up requirements at release do not have a significant positive effect on performance and may even be counterproductive: conflicting goals between the selection rules employed at release and dispatching may lead to an increase in the percentage of tardy jobs. Future research should consider whether the results hold if <b>set-up</b> <b>times</b> are not distributed equally across job types and work centres...|$|R

40|$|International audienceGroup Technology {{exploits}} {{similarities in}} product and process design to effectively meet {{the diversity of}} customer demand. In this paper we consider one of the implementations of this concept - heuristics for family based dispatching. Intrinsic to family based dispatching is the grouping of similar types of products for joint processing. Hence the number of set-ups may be reduced. Consequently, lead-time performance of the shop can be improved. Unfortunately, variances of processing and <b>set-up</b> <b>times</b> - as found in practice - have received little attention in heuristics' construction and testing. To address this issue we propose several new, non-exhaustive heuristics. Whereas existing exhaustive heuristics set batch contents equal to all products available for a family, non-exhaustive heuristics allow for switching families, even when the current family queue is not empty. An extensive simulation study shows how this flexibility in batch composition improves shop performance, especially in case of high variances of processing and <b>set-up</b> <b>times...</b>|$|R

The ergodicity implies the weak convergence of station times, intervisit times and cycle times.
