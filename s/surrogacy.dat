25|$|The {{character}} {{has been involved}} in many of the show's stories of her time. She has portrayed numerous kidnappings, fights, feuds and stunts. She has feuded with Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe), Big Bob (Vincent Ebrahim), Joe Roscoe (Ayden Callaghan) and Freddie Roscoe (Charlie Clapham). She has been pushed from a balcony, held hostage, shot, electrocuted, nearly killed Joe with a wrecking ball and has also been stalked by her secret lover Kim Butterfield (Daisy Wood-Davis). Grace's storylines have been both topical and dramatic – her relationship with Trevor and Esther explored the issue of <b>surrogacy,</b> while her affair with Kim culminated in a dramatic car crash stunt. In 2016, writers brought about the end of Grace's relationship with Trevor. They played Trevor having an affair with Sienna Blake (Anna Passey) and later murdered by Sienna's teenage daughter Nico Blake (Persephone Swales-Dawson) during his wedding to Grace. Producers then introduced Grace's extended family, consisting of three half-brothers and her mother.|$|E
25|$|Embryo {{transfer}} {{may be used}} where a {{woman who}} has eggs but no uterus and wants to have a biological baby; she would require the help of a gestational carrier or surrogate to carry the pregnancy. Also, {{a woman who has}} no eggs but a uterus may utilize egg donor IVF, in which case another woman would provide eggs for fertilization and the resulting embryos are placed into the uterus of the patient. Fertilization may be performed using the woman's partner's sperm or by using donor sperm. 'Spare' embryos which are created for another couple undergoing IVF treatment but which are then surplus to that couple's needs may also be transferred (called embryo donation). Embryos may be specifically created by using eggs and sperm from donors and these can then be transferred into the uterus of another woman. A surrogate may carry a baby produced by embryo transfer for another couple, even though neither she nor the 'commissioning' couple is biologically related to the child. Third party reproduction is controversial and regulated in many countries. Persons entering gestational <b>surrogacy</b> arrangements must make sense of an entirely new type of relationship that does not fit any of the traditional scripts we use to categorize relations as kinship, friendship, romantic partnership or market relations. Surrogates have the experience of carrying a baby that they conceptualize as not of their own kin, while intended mothers have the experience of waiting through nine months of pregnancy and transitioning to motherhood from outside of the pregnant body. This can lead to new conceptualizations of body and self.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Kevin S. Bright and co-written by series creators David Crane & Marta Kauffman. The producers wanted to mark the landmark episode with a major event, choosing to bring a culmination to Phoebe's <b>surrogacy</b> storyline. Earlier scripts had the character insistent on keeping hold of the babies, with the writers later deciding {{it would be better}} off having a sendoff, to keep it dramatic. In its original broadcast on NBC, [...] "The One Hundredth" [...] acquired a 17.7 Nielsen rating, finishing the week ranked second and received good reviews since airing.|$|E
500|$|... "Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)" [...] was {{performed}} by Jay-Z with black and white shots of Brooklyn. Beyoncé appeared on stage again to perform [...] "Pretty Hurts" [...] in a leather-studded jacket with the word [...] "Texas" [...] emblazoned across the back. The pair moved to the mini-stage for the performances of [...] "Part II (On the Run)" [...] and [...] "Young Forever". Home videos of the couples' daughter Blue Ivy {{appeared on the screen}} and an image of [...] "The Carters" [...] written in the sand followed. One of the short projections on the screen showed footage of the pair's wedding ceremony in April 2008 along with their [...] "IV" [...] tattoos, as well as a pregnant Beyoncé showing her bare stomach, with Jay-Z behind, putting the <b>surrogacy</b> and fake pregnancy rumors that have appeared since 2011 to rest. [...] "Lift Off" [...] {{was performed}} as the last song on the set, serving as an outro. During the performance, Beyoncé changed her costumes numerous times.|$|E
500|$|Jill Deans, in a 2000 article, {{used the}} book in a {{discussion}} of adoption, <b>surrogacy,</b> and particularly, embryo donation. She noted that it is [...] "a classic tale of surrogacy" [...] and that it [...] "evokes the intricacies of the nature/nurture debate". She contends that the book celebrates adoptive parents and caregivers, in the form of Horton, but vilifies birth mothers, in the form of Mayzie. Both Deans and Philip Nel point to the book's real-life implications for Geisel and his wife. Deans draws a connection between the elephant-bird in Horton and the Infantograph, a failed invention Geisel created that combined two photos and was meant to give couples an idea of what their children would look like. Nel, meanwhile, connected the book to the short story [...] "Matilda the Elephant". Noting that the Geisels could not have children, Nel argued that [...] "Matilda", and by extension Horton, may have been manifestations of the Geisels' longing for children.|$|E
500|$|... "The One Hundredth" [...] was co-written by show creators David Crane and Marta Kauffman and {{directed}} by Kevin S. Bright. The episode {{takes place in a}} hospital, meaning none of the usual filming sets were used, thus surprising several members of the audience. Crane commented that the hundred episode was a [...] "big milestone" [...] for the series and to mark the major event, Lisa Kudrow's character Phoebe would give birth to triplets. This brought a culmination to the <b>surrogacy</b> story arc, which began in the fourth season; it was developed to accommodate Lisa Kudrow's real life pregnancy. When Kudrow accepted the surrogate mother storyline, the idea of having more than one baby was [...] "comically funny" [...] to Kauffman, and giving birth to triplets or [...] "their brother's children" [...] was something never seen on television. Phoebe's pregnancy gave the writers incredible license for her to [...] "be just outrageously mean and still have it be funny". In order to prepare for the labor and birthing scenes, Kauffman watched a video of her cousin giving birth.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the failed}} <b>surrogacy,</b> Susan decides to enroll on a media course at Eden Hills University. In June 2010, she begins {{receiving}} threats via text messages and emails, {{telling her to}} stay away from the university. She is later followed by an unseen person in a car. Susan later spots the car outside her house and she is very frightened. The cyber bully brings up some of Susan's personal issues within their threats and this make her feel vulnerable. They also make places that Susan has previously felt safe in, feel unsafe. Of this Woodburne said [...] "To feel so vulnerable in your own neighbourhood would be just awful. I think I would be equally frightened". As Susan suffers from multiple sclerosis, the stress has a big impact upon her health. Woodburne said that Susan is usually a very strong person mentally, but she feels out of control because the situation is distressing her. She becomes a victim. Susan tries to stand up to the bully and refuses {{to stay away from}} the university. However, when she arrives for her lesson, she receives another threatening message. This terrifies her and she locks herself in the toilets.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2009, {{a change}} {{occurred}} in Susan's personality. During the <b>surrogacy</b> storyline, viewers saw Susan become the [...] "mother-in-law from hell". Woodbune {{said that it was}} challenging trying to change the character of Susan. During clashes with her son-in-law Daniel Fitzgerald (Brett Tucker), Susan was seen becoming controlling and bossy. Woodburne said [...] "As the story progressed it became apparent {{that we were going to}} have to go to the extremes of the less attractive qualities of our characters. We talked about it and decided to go for it – he would be the overbearing husband and Susan the mother-in-law from hell". Woodburne added that Susan is acting out of love for her daughter and for Libby's desire to have a child. In July 2011, Woodburne told a writer for Channel 5 that she still found the role of Susan challenging. She explained that she likes Susan because she adapts well and takes all the things that happen to her in her stride. Woodburne said Karl and Susan are now less naive and exuberant due to the things they have gone through. When asked what the future holds for her character, Woodburne stated [...] "You know, I'm kind of with Susan. I like the Kennedy house when it's full of noisy kids, being naughty and creating havoc. I like it loud and messy. So that would be my hope, that we get a bit of that happening again." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Susan {{was seen}} {{offering}} {{to become a}} surrogate for her daughter Libby. Following a fight with the hospital board, Susan became pregnant. However, this causes friction with her son-in-law. Following a fall, Susan loses the baby. Woodburne called the scenes [...] "difficult" [...] to film. Alan Fletcher said the storyline [...] "could have been dreadful in the wrong hands", but he was pleased {{at the way the}} scenes were handled. He added [...] "The notion of a mother being a surrogate for their daughter is something you can't pretend is not controversial. The writers embraced that and showed how Susan's decision divided the community, and has potential to divide the family". Neighbours timeslot presented difficulties for the storyline. The writers were forced to tone the plot down to comply with guidelines. Woodburne said [...] "Because of the time of day that our show is on—it's on at 6.30 here and day time in the UK—obviously doing something as controversial as <b>surrogacy</b> at that time slot we would be so restricted by censorship". The storyline received mixed reactions from viewers. Woodburne said that people believe Susan is [...] "such a good mother and it's awesome she's prepared to do this for Libby and Dan". Other viewers have said that Susan should not have got involved and that the storyline was ridiculous as Susan is too old. Neighbours executive producer Susan Bower also spoke out about the storyline and said [...] "I've had quite a few letters from people in England who'd heard about it before it was even in the papers in Australia saying they disagree and think it's shocking".|$|E
2500|$|Altruistic <b>surrogacy</b> {{is legal}} for {{same-sex}} couples in all jurisdictions within Australia, {{with the exception}} of Western Australia, which restricts this service to opposite-sex couples. Some have suggested such restrictions create an inequality for gay couples wanting children. Commercial <b>surrogacy</b> is illegal nationwide in Australia for all couples, though some same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples employ the services of a surrogate in foreign countries. In Australia, the TV drama House Husbands which brings, [...] "the idea of gay relationships, gay marriage and <b>surrogacy,</b> to the forefront" [...] has used altruistic <b>surrogacy</b> for a gay couple as a storyline.

It is believed that only 1 in 20 <b>surrogacy</b> arrangements occur in Australia, with almost all involving foreign surrogates mainly from South-East Asia and the United States. Assisted reproductive technology/treatment (ART) is accessible to same-sex couples in all states and territories, with South Australia being the final jurisdiction to pass such a law, in March 2017.
