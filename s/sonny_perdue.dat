25|$|In early April 2009, the Georgia General Assembly {{created a}} budget crisis for MARTA {{by failing to}} pass a bill that would allow it to access its own capital reserve account, in order to {{compensate}} for a severe drop in sales-tax revenue during the late-2000s recession. MARTA stated that this could force the agency to discontinue operations one day out of the week, possibly a weekday. The agency's budget crisis forced MARTA to lay off 700 employees. Service cuts and other budget-stabilizing measures began in fiscal year 2011, with the first affected service mark-up in September 2010.

2500|$|For {{the past}} two decades, Georgia's {{leadership}} has failed to produce significant agreements with Alabama and Florida. Many people blame {{the leaders of the}} state for this failure. The old course of [...] "Conflict, Conceal, and Capture" [...] has not resulted in any progress. In December 2009 Governor <b>Sonny</b> <b>Perdue's</b> Water Contingency Planning Task Force recommended greater water conservation in the Atlanta region and further negotiation regarding the reallocation of portions of Lake Lanier to supply the needs of metro Atlanta. Nathan Deal, Governor of Georgia in 2011, wanted to resolve the conflict with Alabama by finding new solutions to Atlanta's need for water.|$|R
25|$|National Republicans such as Richard Nixon {{began to}} develop their Southern {{strategy}} to attract conservative white Southerners, especially {{the middle class and}} suburban voters, in addition to migrants from the North and traditional GOP pockets in Appalachia. The transition to a Republican stronghold in the South took decades. First, the states started voting Republican in presidential elections, except for native sons Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Bill Clinton in 1992 and 1996. Then the states began electing Republican senators and finally governors. Georgia was the last state to do so, with <b>Sonny</b> <b>Perdue</b> taking the governorship in 2002. In addition to its middle class and business base, Republicans cultivated the religious right and attracted strong majorities from the evangelical or Fundamentalist vote, mostly Southern Baptists, which had not been a distinct political force prior to 1980.|$|E

A violent EF4 was also confirmed near Darien in McIntosh County where numerous buildings near Interstate 95 were heavily damaged or destroyed. This was the first violent tornado in Georgia since an F4 hit four counties north of Atlanta on March 27, 1994.

The referendum was originally a two-part referendum pitting the 2001 version of the flag against the proposed version and conditional on failed ratification of a new flag considering other flags including the 1956 version. Under this format if the legislators did not approve the newly designed flag over the existing one they could have pursued other designs including the one with the controversial 1956 version of the flag. Reed and a contingent of black legislators from Atlanta limited the referendum to a single vote of preference between the 2003 version and the 2001 version.|$|R

2500|$|Davis's case gained {{increasing}} {{public exposure}} {{and support from}} organizations and prominent individuals. Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu urged the courts to agree {{to hear the evidence}} of police coercion and recanted testimony. An appeal to Governor of Georgia <b>Sonny</b> <b>Perdue</b> urging him to spare Davis's life was sent on behalf of Pope Benedict XVI. Similar appeals were sent by singer Harry Belafonte, Sister Helen Prejean, author of Dead Man Walking, and actor Mike Farrell. Amnesty International published a report about Davis's case characterizing it as a miscarriage of justice and a [...] "catastrophic flaw in the U.S. death penalty machine." [...] The human rights group initiated a letter-writing campaign and delivered 4,000 letters to the clemency board. William S.

Politicians and others such as Jesse Jackson, Jr. and Sheila Jackson Lee, and former Texas District Attorney Sam D.

U.S. Congressman John Lewis spoke to the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles, suggesting that Coles – one of the witnesses who had not recanted – was the real killer. Representatives from the Council of Europe and European Parliament also spoke out on Davis's case, asking U.S. authorities to halt the planned execution and calling for a new trial.|$|E
