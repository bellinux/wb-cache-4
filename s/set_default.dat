50|$|A table (called the {{referencing}} table) {{can refer}} to a column (or a group of columns) in another table (the referenced table) by using a foreign key. The referenced column(s) in the referenced table must be under a unique constraint, such as a primary key. Also, self-references are possible (not fully implemented in MS SQL Server though). On inserting a new row into the referencing table, the relational database management system (RDBMS) checks if the entered key value exists in the referenced table. If not, no insert is possible. It is also possible to specify DRI actions on UPDATE and DELETE, such as CASCADE (forwards a change/delete in the referenced table to the referencing tables), NO ACTION (if the specific row is referenced, changing the key is not allowed) or SET NULL / <b>SET</b> <b>DEFAULT</b> (a changed/deleted key in the referenced table results in setting the referencing values to NULL or to the DEFAULT value if one is specified).|$|E

40|$|International audienceA {{collection}} of formulae, {{regarded as a}} set of prerequisite-free normal defaults, generates a nonmonotonic inference relation through its Reiter skeptical extension. The structure of the initial set totally determines the behavior of the associated inference relation, and the aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate in two directions the link that exists between a <b>set</b> of <b>defaults</b> and its induced inference relation. First, we determine the structural conditions corresponding to the important property of rationality. For this purpose, we introduce the notion of stratification for a <b>set</b> of <b>defaults,</b> and prove that stratified sets are exactly those that induce a rational inference relation. This result is shown to have interesting consequences in belief revision theory, as it can be used to define a nontrivial full meet revision operator for belief bases. Then, we adopt a dynamic point of view and study the effects, on the induced inference relation, of a change in the <b>set</b> of <b>defaults.</b> In this perspective, the <b>set</b> of <b>defaults,</b> considered as a knowledge base, together with its induced inference relation is treated as an expert system. We show how to modify the original <b>set</b> of <b>defaults</b> in order to obtain as output a rational relation. We propose a revision procedure that enables the user to incorporate a new data in the knowledge base, and we finally show what changes can be performed on the original <b>set</b> of <b>defaults</b> in order to take into account a particular conditional that has to retracted from or added to the primitive induced inference relation...|$|R
