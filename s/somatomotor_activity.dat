50|$|In Acute Oral Toxicity Study, no {{mortality}} {{was found}} {{at the end of}} study and sign of toxicity like change in skin and fur, eyes and mucous membrane, and also respiratory, circulatory, autonomic, and central nervous system and <b>somatomotor</b> <b>activity,</b> behavior pattern, sign of tremors, convulsions, salvation, lethargy, sleep, coma were also not found.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Energy {{expenditure}} {{was determined}} in male Fischer 344 rats (235 - 246 g) fed by intravenous (IV) or intragastric (IG) infusion with total parenteral nutrition solutions providing 65 % of nonprotein energy as fat from long-chain triglycÃ©ride(LCT) or a 3 : 1 ad mixture of medium-chain triglycÃ©ride (MCT) and LCT emulsions. Respiratory gas exchange and <b>somatomotor</b> <b>activity</b> were assessed continuously for 24 h during d 5 and 11 of infusion feeding. The MCT infusion resulted in one-third the weight gain noted with LCT infusion (MCT, 10 Â± 2 g/ 14 d; LCT, 32 Â± 4 g/ 14 d; P < 0. 0001). Insulin concentration was 60 % higher with IV than with IG infusion and- 100 % higher with IV-MCT than with IG-MCT or LCT infusion (P < 0. 05). Rats receiving IV in fusion of MCT displayed similar levels of motor activit...|$|E
40|$|The {{midbrain}} {{superior and}} inferior colliculi have critical roles in generating coordinated orienting or defensive behavioral responses to environmental stimuli, {{and it has}} been proposed that neurons within the colliculi can also generate appropriate cardiovascular and respiratory responses to support such behavioral responses. We have previously shown that activation of neurons within a circumscribed region in the deep layers of the superior colliculus and in the central and external nuclei of the inferior colliculus can evoke a response characterized by intense and highly synchronized bursts of renal sympathetic nerve activity and phrenic nerve activity. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that, under conditions in which collicular neurons are disinhibited, coordinated cardiovascular, somatomotor, and respiratory responses can be evoked by natural environmental stimuli. In response to natural auditory, visual, or somatosensory stimuli, powerful synchronized increases in sympathetic, respiratory, and <b>somatomotor</b> <b>activity</b> were generated following blockade of GABAA receptors in a specific region in the midbrain colliculi of anesthetized rats, but not under control conditions. Such responses still occurred after removal of most of the forebrain, including the amygdala and hypothalamus, indicating that the essential pathways mediating these coordinated responses were located within the brain stem. The temporal relationships between the different outputs suggest that they are driven by a common population of "command neurons" within the colliculi. 11 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Several sleep {{disorders}} have a genetic basis. These conditions include the narcoleptic syndrome, sleep walking, periodic movements in sleep, circadian delay syndromes and familial insomnia. These disorders illustrate different control mechanisms involved in sleep and wakefulness, including those determining the prevalence {{and timing of}} NREM and REM <b>activity,</b> <b>somatomotor</b> inhibition and excitation, autonomic discharge, and the circadian framework of sleep. The genetic defect in narcolepsy has been localised to the short arm of chromosome 6, but the chromosomal localisations of the genetic basis for the other disorders are not known. Also, {{with the possible exception}} of acetylcholine, no definite neurotransmitter involved in any aspect of sleep regulation has been positively identified and the biochemical defect in narcolepsy is not known...|$|R
