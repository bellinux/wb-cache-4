Such inflation effects are referred to as "Demand Surge " effects. It is important for insurance companies to properly account for these effects when calculating insurance premiums and determining the economic capital. The paper at hand presents the first econometric model of the Demand <b>Surge</b> <b>effect.</b> Based on 188 catastrophe events in the United States we find that the proposed model is able to explain more than 75 % of variance of the Demand <b>Surge</b> <b>effect</b> and should allow insurance companies to forecast future Demand Surge effects and to incorporate these results in their premium calculations. Demand Surge is positively influenced by the total amount of repair work, however, a possible reconstruction backlog from previous events worsens the situation additionally. The model also deduces a positive relationship between the number of insurance claims per event and the Demand <b>Surge</b> <b>effect,</b> which is due to a less restrictive regulation policy. Furthermore, the Demand <b>Surge</b> <b>effect</b> is more pronounced if the construction sector is in a growth stage. In contrast, a higher capacity of the construction sector has a restraining effect on Demand Surge.

The procedure is carried out up to coastal waters {{by means of a}} grid nesting procedure. During the analysis period, an underestimation of wave parameters and <b>surge</b> <b>effect</b> was observed, mainly {{as a result of the}} misrepresentation of the wind field. The effect of coupling on wave height (Hs) and wave period (Tm- 0. 2) is about 3 % and more than 20 %, respectively.

40|$|A new {{approach}} {{to the study of}} the parametric rolling of ships in a following sea is presented. The new aspect is the consideration of the interference of surge with the roll dynamics. When the waves are long and steep, the oscillatory component of the surge velocity can become large when compared with the mean value. As the oscillatory surge grows in amplitude, it tends also to become asymmetric due to the existence of nonlinearity The nature of asymmetric surging is such that a ship spends more time on the crests than on the troughs of the waves. This means, however, that the probability of capsize is increased because a ship's roll-restoring capability around the crest is at a minimum. We propose a new second-order differential equation of roll which incorporates automatically the <b>surge</b> <b>effect</b> through appropriate position-dependent coefficients. We explore numerically how this asymmetry in surge influences the build up of parametric rolling. The layout of the stability transition lines of the coupled system was found to be notably different from that of a Mathieu-type system.

Data obtained during two time periods are presented. The first data set describes cross-track winds measured between 170 and 210 km during a 5 -day period (25 to 29 March 1979) of mostly high geomagnetic activity. In the second data set, cross-track winds and neutral densities from SETA and exospheric temperatures from the Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar are examined during an isolated magnetic substorm occurring on 21 March 1979. A polar thermospheric wind circulation consisting of a two cell horizontal convection pattern is reflected in both sets of cross-track acceleration measurements. The density response is highly asymmetric with respect to its day/night behavior. Latitude structures of the density response at successive times following the substorm peak suggest the equatorward propagation of a disturbance with a phase speed between 300 and 600 m/s. A deep depression in the density at high latitudes (less than 70 deg) is evident in conjunction with this phenomenon.

40|$|The study about wave-current {{interaction}} is usually carried {{out through the}} use of coupled systems that consider the interaction processes in one way (waves modified by currents). During the PROMISE project, a two-way coupled model was tested and disseminated for the North Sea shelf region. The applicability of such a study was restricted to offshore areas as the used spatial resolution was relatively coarse. In this study, the implementation of an improved version of that system was used in order to reach the coastal area by means of successive nested grids. Attention is focussed on the effect of using a high resolution {{for the study of the}} wave evolution in coastal areas, specifically the Belgian coastal area. A systematic approach is used to take the original coupling system to coastal areas. First, the performance of the coupled system in an ideal basin, whose dimensions resemble the North Sea basin, was assessed. Results of this experiment indicate that tides and surges induce oscillations of Hs and Tm 02 by 5 % and 15 %, respectively, with respect to the typical values computed from an uncoupled version. The modulations of Hs depend on the depth (they increase in shallower areas), while the TM 02 oscillations are more dependent on the sea state and the current field. The spectral shape is also modified. lt was observed that considering a wave dependent sea surface stress in the hydrodynamic model under variable wind conditions increases the computed <b>surge</b> <b>effect.</b> Then, after the implementation of a nesting procedure to the hydrodynamic model, the coupled system was applied to the North Sea region. During the analysis period, an underestimation of wave parameters and <b>surge</b> <b>effect</b> was observed, mainly as a result of the misrepresentation of the wind field. The effect of coupling on Hs and TM 02 is about 3 % and more than 20 %, respectively. The nesting procedure (which is equivalent to increase the spatial resolution of the simulation) tends to improve the qualitative agreement between computed wave parameters and measurements. The same trend is observed for the computed <b>surge</b> <b>effect.</b> Spectral characteristics, like directional spreading and energy distribution, are also improved when nesting is included. In the fine grid, which covers the Belgian coastal area, the radiation stress effect was quantified and was found to be as important as considering the effect of a wave dependent surface stress in the fully coupled system. The order of magnitude of the residual current (with respect the uncoupled version) produced by this latter effect is about 10 cm/s. Concerning the specification of an open boundary conditions in the grid that covers the Belgian coastal region, it is found that the wave evolution in this area is more dependent on the consideration of the coupling between waves and hydrodynamics than on the source of boundary conditions (i. e., either obtained from a coupled or an uncoupled coarser model). Finally, the effect of considering a high spatial and spectral resolution in the wave evolution is studied. This experiment was assessed for the Belgian coastal area implementation. Comparison between measured and computed time series of Hs and TM 02 at two stations indicate that the use of a higher spatial resolution is important to account for the right energy dissipation rate. The spectral energy distribution and directional spreading is clearly improved when a higher spatial resolution is included. Also important is to consider the coupling effect on the spatial distribution of the energy. Difference maps of Hs indicate that the time varying watercolumn induces changes in the order of 10 % compared to the Hs computed from the uncoupled implementation. Most of these variations are found at the sand banks region, and the sign of the differences depend on the phase of the elevation field. The use of a high directional resolution has a comparable effect as considering the coupling. Again, the main effect is observed at the sand banks and at the entrance of the Scheldt river when waves and currents are collinear. The Hs differences pattern is dependent on the wave regime and almost independent on the phase of the hydrodynamic fields...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a solution for}} battery-less power management circuits for micro-power energy converters, allowing energy harvesting systems to operate under continuous and intermittent conditions. The proposed trigger circuit is a fully passive, normally open, single pole, single throw, analog switch driven by a nano-power CMOS control unit. The trigger circuit starts in an OPEN state until the voltage, at its input terminal, reaches a high threshold, when it toggles to the CLOSED state. Once the input voltage drops below a low threshold, the trigger circuit returns to the OPEN state. In the CLOSED state, the trigger circuit creates a low resistance path between the input and output terminals, while at the OPEN state the input is isolated from the output. A first prototype was breadboarded by using discrete components {{for the sake of}} performance evaluation. Low threshold voltages (2. 15 V and 1. 15 V), sub-ohm CLOSED-state resistance, and power consumption requirements (in the order of 55. 9 and 167. 7 nW), coupled with relatively high energy extraction capabilities are confirmed by experimental results. These features put our proposed circuit among the best {{of its kind in the}} state-of-the-art circuits.

40|$|Failure {{of coastal}} {{protection}} due to flooding is {{mainly caused by}} a combination of high water level and waves. If one considers these as independent variables, the probability of failure can be calculated easily, but this would be an incorrect assumption. These two variables are de-pendent, so a method suitable for multivariate statistics is to be applied, if one does not want to over- of underestimate the probability of failure. 'Method de Haan' is a method that is suit-able for extrapolation of dependent variables. In general this method shifts a cloud of observa-tions in exponential space into the area of failure or other relevant area. Because this method does not have a physical basis {{it is important that the}} relation between the variables that are used, holds in cases of extreme events if one wants to determine events with a very low fre-quency of occurrence. In this study the relation between (skewed) set-up and wind speed is examined. Most impor-tant reason to examine these variables is that at RIKZ (National Institute for Coastal and Ma-rine Management) these variables are used to determine the hydraulic variables in case of extreme events. A relation between water level and wave height is used to determine the cor-responding wave heights. Because the highest water levels are of importance skewed set-up is used as a variable instead of water level. By using this variable a more homogeneous data set is generated and the high-est water level can be constructed afterwards. Skewed set-up is the <b>surge</b> <b>effect</b> determined by the highest water level around during a tidal cycle, where this moment does not necessarily coincides with the moment the astronomical tide occurs. Data of four locations are used, covering a period of 23 years of simultaneous data. In order to use homogeneous data selections based on wind speed and set-up are carried out. Three dif-ferent thresholds are imposed for these selection procedures. The extrapolation path with method de Haan using these data sets is compared with a reference situation and results of hydrodynamic model runs where manipulated storm fields are used as input. In 'WAQUA', over 80 model runs are carried out, where a wind and atmospheric pressure field of the 1953 storm, is manipulated. The intensities, storm duration and phase of the storm relative to the astronomical tide are varied. Based on model runs with WAQUA the relation between skewed set-up and aver-age/maximum wind speed at a certain location appears to hold under extreme circumstances. However, only one wind drag relation (Charnock) is used in the model runs. The relation be-tween skewed set-up and average/maximum wind speed with method de Haan (extrapolation path) is physically more plausible if the asymptotic dependence is good, judged by the asymp-totic plots. The extrapolation path also is better if data are selected based on thresholds re-garding set-up. These paths lie closer to the reference situation, although strongly varying with different thresholds that were used. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} dynamic effects {{that the recent}} growth in supply of Distiller Dried Grains (DDGs), due to the ethanol {{production}} surge from corn consumption, has had {{in relation to other}} market feeds, specifically corn, grain sorghum and soybean meal. Prior to the U. S. ethanol surge, more than a half of corn’s production was consumed as feed for livestock. This amount has dropped to around 40 %, as corn is increasingly being used – about 1 / 3 of U. S. supply- for ethanol production. Ethanol’s by-product for feed, DDGs, contains more proteins than corn and serves as substitute in feed rations for livestock, and may likewise affect soybean meal, a protein feed component. In addition, increased corn demand may impact grain sorghum (milo), a similar carbohydrate substitute. A multivariate regime-switching model is applied to two different periods, pre and post- ethanol mandates (Energy Acts of 2005 and 2007), to gauge the dynamic correlations among these markets. Results are consistent with previous literature regarding increasing relationship (correlation) between DDGs and corn, among others. More importantly, an improved characterization of the dynamic inter-relationships between these feed markets not only empirically identifies ethanol <b>surge</b> <b>effects,</b> but serves to assess cross-hedging potential with current corn and soybean meal futures markets.

These effects will be intensified in urban agglomerations as the concentration of population and allied activities are more pronounced there compared to the inland regions. Indian coastal cities are no exception, and {{it is high time}} to delineate these hazard-prone regions and implement proper mitigation and adaptation strategies at city scale. This review article provides an assessment regarding quantification, management and climate change impacts of flood risks in Surat, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata, which are the most populated coastal cities in India. The flood impacts considered in the existing or prevailing analyses are associated with adverse effects on population, land use of cities, transportation and economy caused by different types of riverine and urban flooding, though coastal flooding, tsunami and storm <b>surge</b> <b>effects</b> are less studied. Mumbai and Kolkata are relatively progressive in the assessment of flood risks and adaptation. The present article also suggests strategies to evaluate the relative progress in the assessment of past and future risks and adaptation.

We propose that the strategies should be implemented considering public opinion and should be initialized at the grass root level. Though it is technically difficult to re-plan the city structures in the current scenario, it is possible to adapt to and mitigate the effects of natural hazards through suitable planning and management with the integrated cooperation and involvement of citizens and government as well.|$|R

In these experiments we examined the effects of aggressive encounters and physical restraint in a primate chair on the patterns of LH secretion in ovariectomized, oestrogen-primed female marmosets. Receipt of aggression from a female conspecific, followed by physical restraint for collection of blood samples (at 10 -min intervals for 4 h), resulted in marked declines in LH concentrations during oestradiol-induced LH surges in five animals(from 112 =+- 4 =m/lto 45 =+- 2 =m/l;group means =+- s. e. m.; P< 0 =. 5). This was due to reductions in LH pulse amplitude rather than to changes in pulse frequency. Decreases in plasma concentrations of LH were reversed by treating females with exogenous LH-releasing hormone (LHRH). Cortisol treatment had no effect on LH levels during oestrogen-induced LH <b>surges.</b> <b>Effects</b> of aggressive encounters and physi-cal restraint on plasma LH were not therefore due to reduced pituitary responsiveness to LHRH or to increased plasma concentrations of cortisol. In separate experiments it was found that physical restraint alone had no effect on plasma LH in habitu-ated subjects, and that decreases in plasma LH after receipt of aggression only occurred if animals were subsequently placed in the restraint chair. A sum-mation of stressful effects is therefore required to pro-duce the fall in circulating LH.

5000|$|Hurricane Ike caused [...] {{destruction}} of the peninsula, reducing the region to rubble and causing severe, permanent change in the shoreline. Entire communities along the upper Texas coast were simply wiped out by Ike’s catastrophic storm <b>surge.</b> Ike’s <b>effects</b> were disproportionally felt near the long, low-lying Bolivar Peninsula which has typical elevations around 2 m. Despite being only a strong category 2 storm with maximum winds at landfall of 95 knots (49 m/s, Berg, 2009), Ike’s extremely large, long-lasting surge and waves devastated the peninsula. In Gilchrist, Texas, NOAA aerial photography reveals complete destruction. The Rollover Pass bridge was reduced to one lane. Of the 1,000 buildings in Gilchrist, 99.5% of them were knocked off of their foundations. Of the buildings off of the foundations, the storm demolished some and washed others onto swamplands behind Gilchrist.|$|R
40|$|The {{coastline}} of Bangladesh {{is mostly}} exposed to extreme meteorological and hydrological conditions where cyclones and storm <b>surges</b> cause devastating <b>effects</b> including loss of human lives {{and destruction of}} properties. Coastal vegetation has been considered as a low-cost and natural protection to reduce the energy of current and surge. Present study explored the effectiveness of coastal vegetation against cyclonic storm surge based on species composition, forest width and near-shore run-up slope revealed by field investigations and numerical simulations. A calibrated hydrodynamic numerical model based on modified one-dimensional depth-averaged non-linear long wave differential equations was used to simulate the storm <b>surge</b> mitigation <b>effected</b> by the coastal vegetation. Considering {{two different types of}} coastal species, mangrove species, Rhizophora apiculata and beach species, Casuarina equisetifolia, numerical simulations were conducted to assess the effect of coastal forest on the storm surge mitigation. This analysis showed that double layers of wide vegetation belt (300 m) in the vertical direction with R. apiculata and C. equisetifolia on mild slope (1 : 500) exhibited a strong potential to decrease surge wave height and velocity. However, water depth reduction was low compared with flow velocity reduction. The maximum water depth and current velocity reduced to 1. 4 m (22 % reduction) and 1. 2 m/s (49 % reduction), respectively, behind the vegetation in comparison with the case without vegetation. Wide coastal vegetation belt with mild slope might be suitable for storm surge energy reduction; however, a doubling or tripling of forest width (from 100 m to 200 m o...|$|R
40|$|A field {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} to assess the effect of tillage on water advance and water distribution in the root zone area (0. 5 m) under continuous and surge flow irrigation in a cotton field. The experiment was conducted at the Agriculture Experimental Station, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt. The location was classified as clay soil. The furrows with blocked ends were 76 cm long and 0. 70 m wide with 0. 0024 m m- 1 of slope. To monitor the advance time, six points were established along the furrows at 9, 18, 27, 36, 45 and 76 m from the inlet. In order to study the water distribution along the furrows, soil moisture content was measured using the gravimetric method at 0 - 0. 25 and 0. 25 - 0. 50 m depths at the beginning, middle {{and end of the}} furrows. A hand hoeing tillage system (HH) was compared with a weed control tillage system (WC) under continuous flow (CF) and surge flow irrigation (SF). Hand hoeing tillage decreased the water advance time compared to weed control tillage either under continuous or surge flow irrigation. Surge flow also decreased the advance time compared to continuous flow. The greatest effect on the advance time reduction resulted from the combined <b>effect</b> of <b>surge</b> flow with tillage (SFHH), which reduced the total supplied water by 22. 4 and 25. 7 % during the first and second irrigation, respectively. The single effect of either tillage (CFHH) or surging (SFWC) also reduced the total amount of supplied water compared to continuous flow with weed control tillage (CFWC), but the reduction was less than that in the combined treatments. Due to tillage and <b>surge</b> <b>effects,</b> soil water was efficiently used and distributed uniformly along the furrow length. Combining surge irrigation and tillage could be an efficient method to use irrigation water efficiently and ensure uniform distribution of soil wate...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental investigations on drag force characteristics of vegetation in mitigating {{the impact of}} tsunami and other <b>surge</b> <b>effects</b> by the resistance offered to the flow. The experiment was conducted in a laboratory towing tank of 50 m x 2 m x 2 m. Three types of vegetation species used were the trees with small thin broad leaves (Wetakeyya), large broad leaves (Kottamba) and stick type leaves (Kasa). The drag force characteristics of the vegetations mainly depend on {{the differences in the}} distribution of foliation, different streamlining mechanism of the leaves against flow, the roughness and the shape of the tree trunk. Drag coefficient of vegetation varies with the flow velocity; the lower flow velocities show higher drag coefficients because of the maximum frontal projected area of the plant. The drag coefficients for the canopies show higher values for the Reynolds numbers less than 106. For canopies with large broad leaves (Kottamba), it ranges from 0. 02 to 0. 2. The drag coefficients for small thin broad leaves (Wetakeyya) and stick type leaves (Kasa) range from 0. 1 to 1. 7 and 0. 18 to 0. 7. Comparatively the drag coefficient of Wetakeyya is greater than Kottamba and Kasa at larger Reynolds numbers (Re > 106). Previous studies on vegetal drag are mainly focused on the single rigid cylinders and colony of rigid cylinders. The studies with single rigid cylinders show an almost linear relationship between drag force and square of the mean velocity of flow. However, the limited studies with natural flexible vegetation show a linear relationship between drag force and mean velocity. Drag coefficient for the trunks of above three types of trees were found less than the smooth cylinder for the region of Re > 60000. For this region the drag coefficient for Kasa trunk ranged in between 0. 9 to 1. 0 while for the smooth PVC pipe it ranged in between 1. 2 – 1. 4. For Kottamba it was in between 0. 8 – 0. 9 and for Wetakeyya it was around 0. 6...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a paucity}} of facts {{about the effects of}} the recent {{military}} "Surge" on conditions in Iraq and whether it is paving the way for a stable Iraq. Selective, anecdotal and incomplete analyses abound. Policy makers and defense planners must decide which measures of success or failure are most important, but until now few, if any, systematic analyses were available on which to base those decisions. This paper applies modern statistical techniques to a new data file derived from more than a dozen of the most reliable and widely-cited sources to assess the Surge's impact on three key dimensions: the functioning of the Iraqi state (including violent civilian casualties); military casualties; and financial markets' assessment of Iraq's future. The new and unusually rigorous findings presented here should help inform current evaluations of the Surge and provide a basis for better decision making about future strategy. The analysis reveals mixed evidence on the <b>Surge's</b> <b>effect</b> on key trends in Iraq. The security situation has improved insofar as violent civilian fatalities have declined without any concurrent increase in casualties among coalition and Iraqi troops. However, other areas, such as oil production and the number of trained Iraqi Security Forces have shown no improvement or declined. Evaluating such conflicting indicators is challenging. There is, however, another way to assess the Surge. This paper shows how data from world financial markets can be used to shed light on the central question of whether the Surge has increased or diminished the prospect of today's Iraq surviving into the future. In particular, I examine the price of Iraqi state bonds, which the Iraqi government is currently servicing, on world financial markets. After the Surge, there was a sharp decline in the price of those bonds, relative to alternative bonds. This decline signals a 40 % increase in the market's expectation that Iraq will default. This finding suggests that, to date, the Surge is failing to pave the way toward a stable Iraq and may in fact be undermining it. ...|$|R
