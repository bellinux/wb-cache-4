50|$|The Indian government's Freight Equalisation Scheme (FES) {{which sought}} to {{neutralize}} the geographical advantages of Bihar. A tonne of coal or steel in Dhanbad was sought to be priced the same as, say, in Kanyakumari, some 3,000 km away in Tamil Nadu. Sadly, FES was applied for only those items which gave advantage to Bihar, viz coal and steel; not, for example, the advantage that Chennai enjoyed due to being a port city. This thoroughly ill conceived policy was kept in operation until it managed to break {{the back of the}} most industrialized region of India which was referred as the 'Ruhr' of India at the time of independence. The scheme was in operation till the mid nineties. Another unfortunate example is the <b>sugar</b> <b>policy.</b> At the time of independence and well into the fifties, Bihar produced 25% of India's sugar. However, due to discriminatory policies and lack of research into the local sugar cane varieties, the sugar industry of Bihar and east Uttar Pradesh was brought to its knees. Today Bihar produces less than 2% of the sugar of India.|$|E
40|$|Developing {{countries}} can produce sugar at much lower cost {{than in the}} EU, yet reform of the EU <b>sugar</b> <b>policy</b> will result in both winners and losers among them.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of contemporary <b>sugar</b> trade <b>policy</b> in Indonesia highlights {{problems in the}} institutional framework for trade policy making. The institutions through which <b>sugar</b> trade <b>policy</b> is formulated entrench the interests of rent-seeking bureaucrats, import licence holders and traders {{to the detriment of}} consumers and downstream producers of processed products. Moreover, the resulting trade policy regime has problematic effects on sugarcane farmers. The structure of regulatory intervention is due less to democratic pressures than to the inclusion of vested interests in the institutions that formulate policy. Further, the lack of effective mechanisms for inter-ministerial coordination and for resolving conflicting policy preferences among ministries hinders the development of coherent trade policy and obstructs reform efforts. An institutional framework that facilitates representation of all interests affected by <b>sugar</b> trade <b>policies</b> and public scrutiny of the effects of policy intervention is likely to deliver better outcomes for consumers and producers alike. ...|$|R

40|$|The changes {{recently}} {{introduced in the}} EU Common Market Organization for sugar will interact with preferential imports from developing countries and least developed countries that enjoy preferential treatment for exports to the EU, {{as well as by}} trade and adjustment costs. This paper focuses on the impact of the EU Commissions <b>sugar</b> <b>policy</b> reform and the Everything But Arms initiative on the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries and the Least Developed Countries. Simulations are run with an empirical model structure comprising a partial equilibrium model for the world sugar market and a gravity model to replicate least developed countries bilateral trade with Europe. Particularly, the gravity approach is employed to model the abolition of import tariffs for sugar originating in least developed countries, subject to trade costs, while the partial equilibrium approach is employed to assess the effects of EU Commissions <b>sugar</b> <b>policy</b> reform and the Everything But Arms initiative on world markets. Results suggest that the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries will experience significant reduction in their export revenue, whilst the initial impact on least developed countries may be limited but increasing in the medium run.

Empirical results indicate that changes in consumer preferences and the availability of closer and cheaper sweeteners in food processing, especially high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), are exerting a downward pressure on sugar demand. As the U. S. demand for sugar decreases and the food industry adjusts faster to sweetener choices, the U.

40|$|Sugar {{is one of}} {{the most}} policy {{distorted}} of all commodities, and the European Union, Japan, and the United States are among the worst offenders. Producers in these countries receive more than double the world market price due to production quotas, import controls, and government guaranteed prices. Such high protection has converted this group of OECD producers from net importers of half of the world’s internationally traded sugar to net exporters, in aggregate, over the past thirty years. In the process, lower-cost developing county producers have been deprived of export opportunities. Efforts to reduce protection have met with stiff opposition from well-funded and entrenched supporters of existing policies, while consumers who pay high prices have voiced little opposition because of the small share of their food budgets spent on sugar. However, internal changes in the E. U. and U. S. sugar and sweeteners markets and international commitments make change unavoidable and provides the best opportunity for policy reform in several decades. While pressures for change are less in Japan, it may be the right time to press for global reform of <b>sugar</b> <b>policies</b> focusing on the worst offenders.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} removal of current market {{interventions}} in world sugar markets using a partial-equilibrium international sugar model calibrated on 2002 market data and current policies. We analyze the impact of trade liberalization and {{the removal of}} production subsidies and consumption distortions. The removal of trade distortions alone induces a 27 percent price increase {{by the end of the}} decade relative to the baseline level for sugar. The removal of all trade and production distortions induces a 48 percent price increase by the end of the outlook period. Aggregate trade expands moderately, but location of production and trade patterns are substantially affected. Protectionist countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) (the European Union, Japan, and, to a lesser extent, Mexico and the United States) experience an import expansion or export reduction and significant contraction in production in unfettered markets. World beet production decreases by 21 percent by the end of the decade, whereas world cane production increases by 8 percent.

40|$|The world {{sugar market}} {{has long been}} {{characterized}} by volatile prices and widespread intervention. Controls on domestic prices, demand, and supply have created an inefficient pattern of world production, consumption, and trade. Without government controls, production would shift from the coun-tries with higher-cost, subsidized production (especially the European Commu-nity, Japan, and the United States) to the countries with lower costs (such as Australia, Brazil, and Thailand). The resources saved could then be directed to other activities. <b>Sugar</b> <b>policies</b> in countries with high costs reduce world sugar prices quite substantially {{in the long run}} and increase price variability significantly; produc-tion controls in countries with low costs increase world prices somewhat and also increase their variability. What would happen if all interventions ceased? Average world sugar prices would probably—but not definitely—rise. World prices would definitely vary less, and economic conditions would definitely improve, especially in developing countries that depend heavily on sugar exports. But the prospects for substantial reform of the sugar market are not promising, even though the GAIT Uruguay Round continues. This article puts forward some modest proposals for changing the existing interventions to lessen economic distortions and reduce costs.
