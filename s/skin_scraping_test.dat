25|$|They {{are very}} prone to Demodex Mange due to culling for performance. There are two {{different}} types of Demodex Mange, namely Localized and Generalized Demodex. Although it is not contagious it is sometimes difficult to treat due to immunodeficiency in some puppies. The Localized symptoms are usually loss of hair in small patches on the head and feet of the puppies. This type will usually heal as the puppies grow and their immune systems grow stronger. The second type which is Generalized Demodex mange is a more severe form of the sickness. The symptoms are more severe and include loss of hair throughout the entire body and the skin may also be scabby and bloody. Generalized are usually hereditary due to immunodeficiency genes that are passed on from Sire and Dam to their puppies. A simple <b>skin</b> <b>scraping</b> <b>test</b> will allow the vet to diagnose demodex mange. The most widely used method to treat Demodex Mange is ivermectin injections or oral medications. Since Demodex Mange lives in the hair follicles of the dog, Ivermectin will kill these mites at the source.|$|E
40|$|This study {{compares the}} {{efficacy}} of skin impression with acetate tape and the deep <b>skin</b> <b>scraping</b> <b>test</b> to find D. canis and S. scabiei in dogs. During six months, 134 samples were collected by both techniques from 115 dogs treated at the dermatology service of the Veterinary Hospital of the Federal University of Santa Maria (HVU-UFSM). Of these patients, 27 had demodicosis and 12 had scabies. The impression with acetate tape test (ITT) was shown to be significantly superior to the deep <b>skin</b> <b>scraping</b> <b>test</b> (DSST) in finding D. canis and S. scabiei mites (p = 0. 007). Based on our results we could conclude that acetate tape impression is a reliable method for diagnosing and monitoring therapy of dermatopathies caused by mites {{and can be used}} to replace the traditional deep skin scraping method. In addition, since it is less traumatic for the dog, this method shows more acceptance by the owner...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Dermoscopy is a useful, {{widely used}} tool for {{examining}} pigmented lesions, especially helpful {{in cases of}} an uncertain nature. Nevertheless, doctors may experience diagnostic difficulties while using this method. An example of this {{may be found in}} the examination of subcorneal hematoma, dark nevi with black lamella or lesions of acral volar skin. In such cases, a few diagnostic tricks have proven to be helpful in achieving diagnostic accuracy. This paper reviews various methods of performing dermoscopy, suggesting a number of simple, yet helpful tests. These include the adhesive tape test, the <b>skin</b> <b>scraping</b> <b>test</b> and the ink furrow test. The adhesive tape test is helpful in differentiating between dark melanocytic nevi and melanoma. Hematoma may be more easily differentiated {{with the use of the}} so-called <b>skin</b> <b>scraping</b> <b>test.</b> The confirmation of benign and melanocytic lesions of acral volar skin, on the other hand, is more accurate when using the ink furrow test. These methods have been discussed here based upon a series of literature reviews, the authors’ own experience and, also, iconography. The present article describes novel methods used in dermoscopy, helping to bring about a faster, more accurate diagnostics of those lesions which have proven to be more difficult to recognize. Helpful tricks, such as have been known to professional literature, as well as the authors’ own experience (for instance, applying urea cream to hyperkeratotic lesions or using photographs of skin lesions taken with the aid of a mobile phone camera – all prior to surgery) will surely be considered beneficial to the practitioner, be it dermatologist or any other physician. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Background: Skin {{testing is}} a {{mainstay}} in allergology, and its importance is increasing in several fields. The ability {{to choose the}} most suitable technique according to the clinical setting is an advantage for the medical team. Objectives: To describe in detail an alternative technique of the coetaneous allergy <b>test</b> (<b>skin</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>test)</b> conceived as {{a variation of the}} former skin scratch test; to evaluate its value as a tool for diagnosis of immune sensitization; and to com-pare its accuracy with the skin prick <b>test.</b> Methods: The <b>skin</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>test</b> and <b>skin</b> prick test were performed {{side by side with the}} same allergen extracts in 162 hu-man subjects classified in two groups according to the known presence or absence of serum specific-IgE to these aller-gens. Results: The sensitivity of the <b>skin</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>test</b> to detect immediate reactions was 85. 0 %. The sensitivity of the skin prick test was 86. 5 %.

40|$|Background: Demodex mites are {{involved}} in different skin diseases and are commonly detected by <b>skin</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>tests</b> or superficial biopsies. A new high-definition optical coherence tomography (HD-OCT) with high lateral and axial resolution in a horizontal (en-face) and vertical (slice) imaging mode might offer the possibility of noninvasive and fast in vivo examination of demodex mites. Methods: Twenty patients with demodex-related skin diseases and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were examined by HD-OCT. Mites per follicle and follicles per field of view were counted and compared to <b>skin</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>tests.</b> Results: HD-OCT images depicted mites in the en-face mode as bright round dots in groups of 3 - 5 mites per hair follicle. In the patients with demodex-related disease, a mean number of 3. 4 mites per follicle were detected with a mean number of 2. 9 infested follicles per area of view compared to a mean of 0. 6 mites in 0. 4 infested follicles in the controls. The <b>skin</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>tests</b> were negative in 21 % of the patients. Conclusion: The innovative HD-OCT enables fast and noninvasive in vivo recognition of demodex mites and might become a useful tool in the diagnosis and treatment monitoring of demodex-related skin diseases.

40|$|SummaryObjectiveThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the interleukin 10 (IL- 10) concentrations in the sera of dogs suffering from demodicosis. MethodsTwenty-six dogs were distributed into three groups: demodicosis groups G 1, n= 11 (recurring disease) and G 2, n= 6 (first time occurrence), and a control group, G 3, n= 9 (healthy dogs). All the animals were subjected to <b>skin</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>tests</b> and blood harvesting for serum extraction. In G 1 and G 2 only those animals with Demodex canis positive skin tests were included, while healthy dogs were included in G 3. To assess IL- 10 levels the commercial Quantikine Canine IL- 10 Immunoassay® (R&D Systems) kit was used. ResultsThe mean IL- 10 level obtained for G 1 was 269. 4 pg/ml (sd= 290. 8 pg/ml), for G 2 it was 28. 5 pg/ml (sd= 19. 7 pg/ml) while the mean for G 3 was 11. 9 pg/ml (sd= 2. 3 pg/ml). There was a significant difference between G 1 and the other two groups. ConclusionsAccording to our results, dogs with reoccurring demodicosis have higher IL- 10 levels than healthy dogs and those suffering the disease for the first time...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundPityriasis versicolor is a {{superficial}} fungal {{infection of the}} skin. Multiple modalities of therapy have been used including both topical and systemic agents, such as imidazoles, triazoles and allylamines. ObjectiveTo {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} topical 1 % diclofenac gel in the treatment of pityriasis versicolor in comparison with topical clotrimazole cream and aqua rosa cream as a placebo control. Patients and methodsThis is a single-blinded, comparative therapeutic trial of topical 1 % diclofenac gel in the treatment of pityriasis versicolor in comparison with topical 1 % clotrimazole cream and aqua rosa cream as a placebo control group was conducted at the Department of Dermatology – Baghdad Teaching Hospital during November 2006 –November 2008. This study included 75 patients (39 males and 36 females). They were divided randomly into three groups, each containing 25 patients. Group A patients treated with diclofenac gel: include 15 (60 %) males and 10 (40 %) females. Their ages ranged from 15 to 44 (23. 72 ± 6. 52) years, while the duration of the disease ranged from 1 to 24 (4. 28 ± 5. 79) months. Group B patients treated with clotrimazole cream: composed of 13 (52 %) males and 12 (48 %) females, their ages ranged from 15 to 38 (22. 56 ± 5. 09) years, and the duration of the disease ranged from 1 to 18 (3. 76 ± 3. 98) months. Group C patients treated with aqua rosa cream: contain 11 (44 %) males and 14 (56 %) females, their ages ranged from 16 to 33 (23. 68 ± 4. 98) years and the duration of the disease ranged from 1 to 18 (3. 26 ± 3. 53) months. Detailed history, close clinical examination, <b>skin</b> <b>scraping</b> <b>test</b> and Wood’s light examination were done for all patients. Patients with immune suppression conditions or who received treatment during the last 2 months before the beginning of the study were excluded. Every patient was instructed to apply the drug twice daily for 1 -month and to be seen every 2 weeks during the treatment and the follow up which is another 1 -month. All patients were assessed clinically; <b>skin</b> <b>scraping</b> <b>test</b> and Wood’s light examination were done at each visit. ResultsThe result of this study revealed {{that at the end of}} 4 weeks: in Group A 14 (56 %) patients had complete improvement (P value= 0. 00004), while in Group B 23 (92 %) patients had complete improvement (P value < 0. 00000001) and no one achieved complete improvement in Group C. Mild side effects were recorded as itching in few patients, which do not need to discontinue the therapy. ConclusionDiclofenac gel proved to be an effective, new topical treatment for pityriasis versicolor infections, and it is safe with no important side effects and well tolerated by the patients, but in the present concentration (1 %) it cannot compete with other much superior topical drugs...|$|E

40|$|Fur mites are a {{persistent}} problem in contemporary laboratory mouse colonies. We conducted several studies to evaluate fur mite diagnostic methodologies {{and interpretation of}} results. Retrospective analysis of test results from sentinel mice exposed to soiled bedding collected from colonies infested with Myobia musculi and Myocoptes musculinus revealed the <b>skin</b> <b>scrape</b> <b>test</b> to be more reliable than pelt examination, provided that both the head and dorsal thoracolumbar regions were sampled. To assess their diagnostic accuracy, 3 commercial laboratories were sent positive control slides containing mites, mite parts, or eggs in sets of slides containing diagnostic skin scrapings in varying ratios. Laboratory B correctly identified the positive control slide. Laboratory A identified 1 of 3 positive control slides, whereas laboratory C failed to identify both positive control slides submitted. To determine the time required for a mouse to shed its entire hair coat, fur of Crl:CD 1 (ICR), BALB/cAnNCrl, and Crl:CFW(SW) albino mice was dyed black {{and the presence of}} dyed fur evaluated monthly for 8 mo. Limited dyed hair was still present at 8 mo; therefore, finding eggs or egg casings many months after treatment cessation does not necessarily imply treatment failure. To evaluate the effectiveness of soiled bedding sentinels for detection of fur mites in a mite-infested colony, we exposed naïve mice to varying amounts (100 %, 50 %, 25 %, 2. 5 %, and 0 %) of soiled bedding in clean bedding.

40|$|We {{read with}} {{interest}} Mello and Madeira’s comments on our article 1 and herein we discuss the points they raised. They emphasized <b>skin</b> <b>scraping</b> for the diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis. We agree that <b>skin</b> <b>scraping</b> is a good method for the diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis; however, it has shown to be less sensitive than press imprint smear (PIS), 2 – 5 and <b>skin</b> <b>scraping</b> should not be done in clearly infected ulcers {{and should not be}} performed in non-ulcerated lesions. On the other hand, local anesthesia is recommended for the comfort of the patient. As <b>skin</b> <b>scraping</b> does not elucidate a large proportion of cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis, neither does it allow the diagnosis of several other diseases, so we recom-mend that a skin biopsy should be performed at the same time. To do it, one will need all things used in PIS, plus a scalpel blade or a curette, making its cost a little higher than with PIS. Suturing is not necessary for a 3 -mm punch biopsy. We understand that a microscopy technician with a short train-ing course can learn to identify amastigotes, because he or she is someone already used to see other microorganisms. We are not referring to a lay person on microscopy. On the other hand, the performance of procedures (<b>skin</b> <b>scraping</b> or other) by technicians, is a matter that concerns us because before doing scraping or other procedures, it is necessary to evaluate the patient and the lesion: if the lesion is infected, if it is close to varicose veins, and other aspects of it. These interventions require training and qualification that a technician does not have to perform the tasks Mello and Moreira suggest. We should make all efforts to guarantee that even in poor-resource areas, any intervention in humans, even the simplest one should be done in accordance with the best practices, by quali-fied professional and under good supervision...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare the sensitivity of deep <b>skin</b> <b>scraping,</b> hair plucking, and exudate microscopy for the diagnosis of canine demodicosis. Sixty-seven dogs diagnosed with demodicosis were enrolled in the study. Thirty dogs had localized and 37 had generalized demodicosis. Twenty-seven of the 67 dogs had complicated (secondarily infected) and 40 had noncomplicated form. On each dog, a single lesion was randomly selected to obtain one deep <b>skin</b> <b>scraping,</b> hair plucking, and, when present (n = 13) exudate. For <b>skin</b> <b>scraping</b> and exudate microscopy, an area under a cover slip measuring 2. 2 x 2. 2 mm was examined, while trichography included the evaluation of 100 hair shafts. At least one parasitic element was found in 85. 1 % of trichograms, and 100 % of exudate preparations. The number of parasitic elements was higher in skin scrapings compared to the other two methods. The diagnostic sensitivity of skin scrapings was higher than that of hair pluckings for the total number of samples (P = 0. 002) and for those obtained from dogs with the localized (P = 0. 004) and the noncomplicated (P = 0. 002) forms of the disease. The diagnostic sensitivity of hair pluckings was higher in generalized and complicated demodicosis compared to the localized and noncomplicated variants.

Conventional direct optical examination on <b>skin</b> <b>scraping</b> and histological examination were later performed. RESULTS: Mucormycetes observed by EVCM presented as hyper-reflective elongated 20 μm in diameter structures with perpendicular ramifications. Fungi were found both under reflectance and fluorescence mode and were better visible with acridine orange under fluorescence EVCM. Conventional direct optical examination on <b>skin</b> <b>scraping</b> and histological examination found the same elongated and branching structures confirming the presence of Mucormycetes.
