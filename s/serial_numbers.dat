5|$|In late 1971 the FBI {{distributed}} {{lists of}} the ransom <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> to financial institutions, casinos, race tracks, and other businesses that routinely conducted significant cash transactions, and to law enforcement agencies around the world. Northwest Orient offered a reward of 15% of the recovered money, {{to a maximum of}} $25,000. In early 1972 U.S. Attorney General John Mitchell released the <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> to the general public. In 1972 two men used counterfeit 20-dollar bills printed with Cooper <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> to swindle $30,000 from a Newsweek reporter named Karl Fleming in exchange for an interview with a man they falsely claimed was the hijacker.|$|E
5|$|Any firearm {{collected}} {{during the course of}} an investigation could yield viable evidence if examined. For forensic firearm examination specific evidence that can be recovered include weapon <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> and potentially fingerprints left on the weapon's surface.|$|E
5|$|Billy Clanton {{was armed}} with Colt Frontier 1873 revolvers which were {{identified}} by their <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> at the Spicer hearing. C.S. Fly found Billy Clanton's empty revolver in his hand where he lay and took it from him.|$|E
50|$|<b>Serial</b> <b>number</b> {{comparisons}} {{are intended to}} use <b>Serial</b> <b>Number</b> Arithmetic as defined in RFC 1982. However, this was not clearly specified in RFC 1034, resulting in not all clients perform the <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> check, in the preamble, in the same way. Some clients check merely that the <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> supplied by the server {{is different from that}} known by the client, or non-zero. Other clients check that the <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> supplied by the server is within a given range of the <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> already known by the client. Yet other clients still perform the latter check and additionally check that the <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> supplied by the server is not zero.|$|R
50|$|Each {{machine was}} given a <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> and user manuals were printed. At first, Thomas {{differentiated}} machines by capacity and therefore gave the same <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> to machines of different capacities. This was corrected in 1863 and each machine was given its own unique <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> starting with a <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> of 500.|$|R
50|$|During {{the early}} part of manufacturing, Thomas {{differentiated}} machines by capacity and therefore gave the same <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> to machines of different capacities. He corrected this in 1863, giving every machine its own unique <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> starting with a <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> of 500. This is why there isn't any machine with a <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> in between 200 and 500.|$|R
5|$|Stamp {{booklets}} {{were first}} put on sale on 21 August 1931. Booklet construction was a lightweight cardboard cover stitched on the left-hand side with panes of stamps (usually four panes), advertising panes and interleaving bound in. Until 1956 most booklets had {{half of the}} front cover devoted to advertising, and until 1963 booklets also had <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> on the front cover: two numbers indicated the year of issue and serial number (in that order on the early issues but with the order reversed for later issues), until 1963 when the <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> ceased.|$|E
5|$|The final {{production}} revolvers were possibly produced after the Great Kantō earthquake and possibly only 325 of these revolvers were produced. Known examples have <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> ranging from 58,903 and 59,227.|$|E
5|$|The medallions {{were struck}} in {{sterling}} silver {{two to three}} months prior to the scheduled mission, though it is unclear whether <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> were added pre or post-flight. The medallions were stored in the Command Service Module during flight and on missions involving a lunar landing, a small number were brought to the lunar surface aboard the Lunar Module. The flown medallions were returned to the Robbins Company after the flight to have the dates engraved and for a final polishing. Except where noted, all medallions struck for Apollo 7–14 were flown, and <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> for Apollo 14–17 medallions appear on the rim.|$|E
50|$|The <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> {{is always}} four digits, 0-9. Leading zeros are {{included}} in the <b>serial</b> <b>number.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{check digit}} is derived by {{dividing}} the 7 digit <b>Serial</b> <b>Number</b> by 7. The remainder determines the Check Digit. Example: <b>Serial</b> <b>Number</b> 8114074 divided by 7 is 1159153 with remainder 4. Therefore the <b>Serial</b> <b>Number</b> + Check Digit is 81140744.|$|R
50|$|On 20 July 2007 Diamond Aircraft {{announced}} the roll {{out of its}} second D-JET, <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> 002. <b>Serial</b> <b>number</b> 002 is the first D-JET intended {{to conform to the}} expected production configuration in its structural layout and aerodynamic design. D-JET prototype <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> 002 first flew on 14 September 2007. It was joined by D-JET <b>Serial</b> <b>Number</b> 003, which first flew on 15 April 2008.|$|R
5|$|Early {{production}} Type 26s have no external markings. The revolvers have markings {{that indicate}} they were arsenal re-worked and {{believed to have}} been produced in late 1893 or early 1894 before official adoption. It is possible that around 300 revolvers with no external marking were produced. No known examples of Type 26 revolvers have duplicate <b>serial</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 2007 DragonFly BSD {{received}} a new device file system (devfs), which dynamically adds and removes device nodes, allows accessing devices by connection paths, recognises drives by <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> and removes {{the need for}} pre-populated /dev file system hierarchy. It was implemented as a Google Summer of Code 2009 project.|$|E
5|$|The State Bank was {{not sure}} how much it {{actually}} lost from the robbery, but the best estimates were around 341,000 rubles, worth around 3.4million US dollars as of 2008. About 91,000 rubles were in small untraceable bills, with the rest in large 500-ruble notes that were difficult to exchange because their <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> were known to the police.|$|E
50|$|Today, the Cloudboy is an {{extremely}} rare aircraft; only four Model 6 Cloudboys are still registered. Known examples include: N787H, <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> 6002, owned by Ronald Alexander and displayed at the Candler Field Museum in Williamson, Georgia; N788H, <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> 6003, {{on display at the}} Golden Wings Flying Museum in Blaine, Minnesota; N795H, <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> 6004, on display at the Yanks Air Museum in Chino, California; N786H, <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> 6010.|$|R

5|$|The unmarked {{bills from}} the robbery {{were easy to}} exchange, but the <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> of the 500-ruble notes were known to the authorities, making them {{impossible}} to exchange in Russian banks. By the end of 1907, Lenin decided to exchange the remaining 500-ruble notes abroad. Krasin had his forger try to change some of the <b>serial</b> <b>numbers.</b> Two hundred of these notes were transported abroad by Martyn Lyadov (they were sewn into his vest by the wives of Lenin and Bogdanov at Lenin's headquarters in Kuokkala). Lenin's plan was to have various individuals exchange the stolen 500-ruble notes simultaneously {{at a number of}} banks throughout Europe. Zhitomirsky heard of the plan and reported it to the Okhrana, who contacted police departments throughout Europe asking them to arrest anyone who tried to cash the notes.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{variants}} of the $10 million denomination, the primary difference being the typeface {{and size of}} the serial number. Those with slightly larger <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> bear the prefix DA. The $25 million banknote is larger in dimension out {{of the rest of the}} 2008 series.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, after {{protracted}} negotiations, the recovered {{bills were}} divided equally between Ingram and Northwest Orient's insurer; the FBI retained 14 examples as evidence. Ingram sold fifteen of his bills at auction in 2008 for about $37,000. To date, {{none of the}} 9,710 remaining bills have turned up anywhere in the world. Their <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> remain available online for public search.|$|E
50|$|As {{quality control}} finds {{defective}} {{notes in the}} printing process after the <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> has been overprinted, they are taken out with their <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> written down and replaced with another banknote printed specifically for this purpose, so {{that the number of}} banknotes being printed stays the same in each production batch. This saves time and money compared to re-printing exactly the same <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> that was used before. It is rare that the replacement banknote has the same <b>serial</b> <b>number</b> as the original faulty one. A replacement note will have its own <b>serial</b> <b>numbering</b> system that separates it from the normal numbering system.|$|R

5|$|Other {{security}} features include lithographic print (the resulting background hinders camera counterfeiting), anti-copying line structures, perfect registration, microprinting, asymmetrical <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> and windowed security threads (thin ribbons {{woven into the}} paper). Polymer versions of the banknote include two clear windows and other {{security features}} that substitute its paper version. Several features that are invisible {{to the naked eye}} appear when both versions of the banknote are exposed under UV light.|$|E
5|$|Two {{variations}} {{that were}} issued for the $10000 and $100000 denominations are {{recognised in the}} Standard Catalog of World Paper Money: the difference between them {{was the use of}} digit grouping.

5|$|At {{the police}} station, Hank tells his rehearsed story to real FBI agents. As Sarah predicted, the agents {{do not believe}} that Hank, an {{upstanding}} member of the community, would be capable of such wrongdoing. Although he is ruled out as a suspect, Hank is told that the money was part of a ransom and that many of the bills' <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> were written down to track the cash. Hank realizes he cannot use the money without being caught; he goes home and burns it all. In a closing narration, Hank reflects on his losses; as he tries to move on with his life, the murderous events constantly haunt him.|$|E

5|$|Brackman {{claims that}} despite the arrests, Lenin {{continued}} his attempts to exchange the 500-ruble notes and did manage to trade some of them for 10,000 rubles from an unknown woman in Moscow. According to Nicolaevsky, however, Lenin abandoned attempts to exchange the notes after the arrests, but Bogdanov tried (and failed) to exchange some notes in North America, while Krasin succeeded in forging new <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> and managed to exchange several more notes. Soon after, Lenin's associates burned all the 500-ruble notes remaining in their possession.|$|E
5|$|Forensic firearm {{examination}} is {{the forensic}} process of examining {{the characteristics of}} firearms {{as well as any}} cartridges or bullets left behind at a crime scene.

Examiners can also look for fingerprints on the weapon and cartridges, and then viable prints can be processed through fingerprint databases for a potential match.|$|E
5|$|In early 1973, {{with the}} ransom money still missing, The Oregon Journal republished the <b>serial</b> <b>numbers</b> and offered $1,000 {{to the first}} person to turn in a ransom bill to the {{newspaper}} or any FBI field office. In Seattle, the Post-Intelligencer made a similar offer with a $5,000 reward. The offers remained in effect until Thanksgiving 1974, and though there were several near-matches, no genuine bills were found. In 1975 Northwest Orient's insurer, Global Indemnity Co., complied with an order from the Minnesota Supreme Court and paid the airline's $180,000 claim on the ransom money.|$|E
