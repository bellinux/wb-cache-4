50|$|Under {{the fork}} {{there is a}} {{projecting}} guard pin which passes through a notch in a separate <b>safety</b> <b>roller</b> disk on the balance shaft. In normal operation it doesn't have a function. Its purpose {{is to make sure}} the fork is in the right position to receive the impulse pin if a jar to the watch prematurely 'unlocks' the lever from the escape wheel.|$|E
50|$|Markey drew some {{controversy}} through {{his proposal to}} introduce legislation that deals with amusement parks' roller coasters, believing that newer, faster rides that exert greater G-pressures on the human body are dangerous mentally and physically, {{despite a lack of}} concrete evidence to support these claims, and contrary to studies that affirmed the <b>safety</b> of <b>roller</b> coasters in general.|$|R
30|$|For {{the rotary}} kiln, the roller shafts {{are among the}} main parts {{that make up the}} kiln. They are {{considered}} the most important items related to <b>safety</b> because a <b>roller</b> shaft that has damage can directly cause an accident (Chapman 1985).|$|R
25|$|On 14 May 2011, a 48-year-old {{man died}} while riding Black Mamba, an {{inverted}} roller coaster. According to German <b>safety</b> inspectors the <b>roller</b> coaster and all safety features were sound and passed extensive testings by the TÃœV. Autopsy {{showed that the}} death {{was caused by a}} heart attack.|$|R
5000|$|In 2001, the Six Flags Entertainment Corporation {{promoted}} Chickola {{to chief}} corporate engineer. He {{is responsible for}} the design, maintenance and <b>safety</b> of 120 <b>roller</b> coasters and over 600 other amusement park rides. [...] Chickola redesigned the Texas Giant, a wooden roller coaster, into the world's first hybrid roller coaster.|$|R
5000|$|In 2006 many renovations {{took place}} at the park, of which were focused more on its {{aesthetics}} than actual ride <b>safety.</b> The <b>roller</b> coaster had $10,000 dollars worth of wood repairs done and was renamed [...] "The Nightmare". The Log Jam, the only water ride, had pumps replaced and systems checked. The noticeable difference to the park after the 2006 restoration was the baby blue and pink paint that covers it. The Restore Hope organization got involved to regain support to rebuild it with an emphasis on a community effort and involvement in the restoration process. The plan was to restore it {{within the next few years}} and begin a five step expansion process to help it grow and become an integral part of the Wichita community.|$|R
50|$|However, {{those whose}} {{claustrophobia}} {{is caused by}} the fear of restriction would have the hardest time staying calm in situations where they are unable to move, such as when their hands are tied behind their back or they are tied to a chair. These {{people are more likely to}} have coasterphobia than those fearing suffocation. The <b>safety</b> harnesses on <b>roller</b> coaster seats stimulate the feeling of claustrophobia, causing severe anxiety and panic due to the confined space and inability to escape.|$|R
5000|$|Competing {{parks and}} theaters were {{maintaining}} parity or lowering prices to Luna's rates of admission. Luna's tickets were {{set at a}} dime for adults and a nickel for children for gate admission, plus ten cents admission to each attraction. To compete with these venues, Luna management ran promotional advertisements with local vendors, such as Kolb's Pan-Daddy bread to distribute free gate tickets; tried bundling tickets, that is, offering free admission and waiving fees for certain venues; advertised out of state; and copied ideas found in other parks, such as the [...] "Baby Incubator", all with modest success. Through these marketing efforts, they discovered dancing {{as a source of}} revenue. With the sound of orchestrated music played by the park's band, they could charge ten cents per person per dance in the Dance pavilion, {{and by the end of}} the evening with a repertoire of 30 songs, and over 300 minimum visitors, could earn significant daily revenue. The park enhanced this strategy by hiring dance instructors encouraging people to [...] "get out on the floor" [...] and [...] "try dancing lessons" [...] before regular dancing started and charging for private lessons. Dancing was very popular in this era and quickly became the principal money-maker at the park until its end. Accidents in the amusement industry induced changes in 1914 to enhance <b>safety.</b> Reportedly <b>roller</b> coasters in other parks had taken a yearly toll in [...] "maimed and crippled limbs". Direction by the Board of Directors to enhance safety [...] "to make doubly sure it is nigh impossible for anything to go wrong at the park" [...] to park management came [...] "with an immense sum spent".|$|R
