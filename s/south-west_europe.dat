40|$|Dust storms have a {{great many}} {{environmental}} implications in the world's dry lands where they are particularly common. Four main classes of dust event are identified and defined: dust storms, dust haze, blowing dust and dust devils. The geography of dust storms is analysed in each of eight major world regions: Africa, the Middle East, <b>South-west</b> Asia, <b>Europe</b> and the USSR, China, Australia, North America and Latin America. Terrestrially observed meteorological data and data from remote sensing platforms are employed to identify the major source areas in each region, their seasonality, diurnal patterns of activity and trajectories of long-range transport. Among the important controls on the frequency distribution of dust storm activity are the meteorological conditions that generate dust-raising winds, {{and a number of}} meteorological systems commonly cause dust storms in all global regions. These include low pressure fronts with intense baroclinal gradients, pressure gradient winds between moving or stationary air masses, katabatic winds and convectional cells. The nature of the surface upon which deflation occurs is also important; typical dust-producing geomorpholological units include alluvial spreads, lacustrine deposits, desert depressions, loess deposits and reactivated fossil dunes. Dust storm activity is prone to considerable variation. The seasonal characteristics are explicable with reference to the meteorological systems generating dust, the state of ground cover, particularly vegetation, and the effects of seasonal rainfall. Substantial variations also occur from year to year, and land use and climatic variations can substantially affect their occurrence. </p...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAim We {{explore the}} {{relationship}} between current European distributions of amphibian and reptile species and observed climate, and project species potential distributions into the future. Potential impacts of climate warming are assessed by quantifying the magnitude and direction of modelled distributional shifts for every species. In particular we ask, first, what proportion of amphibian and reptile species are projected to lose and gain suitable climate space in the future? Secondly, do species projections vary according to taxonomic, spatial or environmental properties? And thirdly, what climate factors might be driving projections of loss or gain in suitable environments for species? Location Europe. Methods Distributions of species are modelled with four species–climate envelope techniques (artificial neural networks, generalized linear models, generalized additive models, and classification tree analyses) and distributions are projected into the future using five climate-change scenarios for 2050. Future projections are made considering two extreme assumptions: species have unlimited dispersal ability and species have no dispersal ability. A novel hybrid approach for combining ensembles of forecasts is then used to group linearly covarying projections into clusters with reduced inter-model variability. Results We show that a great proportion of amphibian and reptile species are projected to expand distributions if dispersal is unlimited. This is because warming in the cooler northern ranges of species creates new opportunities for colonization. If species are unable to disperse, then most species are projected to lose range. Loss of suitable climate space for species is projected to occur mainly in the <b>south-west</b> of <b>Europe,</b> including the Iberian Peninsula, whilst species in the south-east are projected to gain suitable climate. This is because dry conditions in the south-west are projected to increase, approaching the levels found in North Africa, where few amphibian species are able to persist. Main conclusions The impact of increasing temperatures on amphibian and reptile species may be less deleterious than previously postulated; indeed, climate cooling would be more deleterious for the persistence of amphibian and reptile species than warming. The ability of species to cope with climate warming may, however, be offset by projected decreases in the availability of water. This should be particularly true for amphibians. Limited dispersal ability may further increase the vulnerability of amphibians and reptiles to changes in climate...|$|R

40|$|Hybridization is a {{widespread}} phenomenon, which plays crucial roles in the speciation of living beings. However, unnatural mixing of historically isolated taxa due to human-related activities has increased in recent decades, favouring levels of hybridization and introgression that can {{have important implications for}} conservation. The wild red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa, Phasianidae) populations have recently declined and the releases of farm-reared partridges have become {{a widespread}} management strategy. The native range of the red-legged is limited to the <b>south-west</b> of <b>Europe</b> (from Italy to Portugal). This species does not breed in sympatry with the chukar partridge (A. chukar), whose range is Eurasian (from Turkey to China). However, red-legged partridges have often been hybridized with chukar partridges to increase the productivity of farmed birds, and game releases may have spread hybrid birds into the wild. In this study, we investigated the fitness (survival and breeding) differences between hybrid and >pure> red-legged partridges in a wild population located in central Spain. Incubation probability was similar in hybrids and >pure> partridges. Hybrid females laid larger clutches than >pure> ones, but hatching success did not differ between hybrid and >pure> partridges. Hybrid birds had lower survival rate than >pure> ones, mainly because of higher predation rates. Our results show that, despite lower survival, hybrid partridges breed in natural populations, so this could increase extinction risk of wild pure partridge populations, through releases of farmed hybrid birds. The consequences of continued releases could be of vital importance for the long term conservation of wild red-legged partridges. F.

5000|$|The ancestry {{of modern}} Iberians (Spanish and Portuguese) is {{consistent}} with the geographical situation of the Iberian Peninsula in the <b>south-west</b> corner of <b>Europe.</b> The strongest prehistoric connection is with Atlantic Europe as suggested by the predominance of Y-Chromosome Haplogroup R1b throughout the peninsula. There is also a connection with the Eastern Mediterranean region. However, this is lesser than that of the Southeast of the European continent (i.e. the Balkans and Southern Italy) due to Iberia being the farthest away from the Bosphorus, the main bridge of population expansions from Anatolia into Europe during prehistoric times. Indeed, studies point to Eastern Mediterranean genetic contribution to Iberia to have been driven primarily by historical rather than prehistorical population movements (i.e. Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Jews and Levantine Arabs rather than earlier Neolithic farmers). Iberia stands out among other southern European populations as having the highest levels of ancestry originating in North Africa as well as in Sub-Saharan Africa, with the concentration of both being highest on the western and southern parts of the peninsula, which is largely ascribed to the long Islamic presence in the Iberian peninsula and possibly African slavery. [...] Significant genetic differences are found among, and even within, Spain's different regions, which {{can be explained by the}} wide divergence in their historical trajectories and Spain's internal geographic boundaries. The Basque Region in Northern Spain, is the most genetically distinct and typically Atlantic European. Furthermore, the Basque region and Catalonia hold the least Eastern Mediterranean ancestry in Iberia. African influence is largely concentrated in the Southern and Western regions of the peninsula. Germanic influence is small and limited to Catalonia, Galicia and Northern Portugal.|$|R

5000|$|In 1204, {{after the}} Fourth Crusade conquered Constantinople, the crusaders {{established}} a Latin Empire (1204-1261) in that city, while the defeated Byzantine Empire's descendants established two smaller, short-lived empires in Asia Minor: the Empire of Nicaea (1204-1261) and the Empire of Trebizond (1204-1461). Constantinople was retaken in 1261 by the Byzantine successor state centered in Nicaea, re-establishing the Byzantine Empire until 1453, {{by which time}} the Turkish-Muslim Ottoman Empire (ca. 1300-1918), had conquered most of the region. The Ottoman Empire was a successor of the Abbasid Empire {{and it was the}} most powerful empire to succeed the Abbasi empires at the time, as well {{as one of the most}} powerful empires in the world. The Ottoman Empire centered on modern day Turkey, dominated the eastern Mediterranean, overthrew the Byzantine Empire to claim Constantinople and it would start battering at Austria and Malta, which were countries that were key to central and to <b>south-west</b> <b>Europe</b> respectively [...] - [...] mainly for their geographical location. The reason these occurrences of batterings were so important was because the Ottomans were Muslim, and the rest of Europe was Christian, so there was a sense of religious fighting going on. This was not just a rivalry of East and West but a rivalry between Christians and Muslims. Both the Christians and Muslims had alliances with other countries, and they had problems in them as well. The flows of trade and of cultural influences across the supposed great divide never ceased, so the countries never stopped bartering with each other. These epochal clashes between civilizations profoundly shaped many people's thinking back then, and continues to do so in the present day. Modern hatred against Muslim communities in South-Eastern Europe, mainly in Bosnia and Kosovo, has often been articulated in terms of seeing them as unwelcome residues of this imperialism: in short, as Turks. Moreover, Eastern Orthodox imperialism was not re-established until the coronation of Peter the Great as Emperor of Russia in 1721. Likewise, with the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815), the Austrian Empire (1804-1867) emerged reconstituted as the Empire of Austria-Hungary (1867-1918), having [...] "inherited" [...] the imperium of Central and Western Europe from the losers of said wars.|$|E

40|$|From the Introduction]. This paper {{sets out}} the {{beginnings}} of an argument, namely that the Western Mediterranean {{can be seen as}} a region that is starting to develop traits characteristic of security complexes in terms of the security dynamics that are at play within it [...] particularly in relation to the interactions (both positive and negative) existing between North Africa and <b>south-west</b> <b>Europe,</b> and especially in light of the agenda generated by the end of the Cold War, by the aftermath of the Gulf War and by the developments taking place within the European Union (EU). My hypothesis is that the security interactions and interdependence existing within the Western Mediterranean warrant the investigation of this region in terms of a security complex that comprises North Africa and <b>south-west</b> <b>Europe</b> as two sub-complexes that belong respectively to the Middle East as a lower-level security complex and the EU as a higher-level security complex. Thus, my contention is that the Western Mediterranean can function as a link between the EU and the Middle East as two parent complexes. Hence I wish to label it a liaison security complex. First, before considering actual Western Mediterranean security problems, this paper briefly discusses the dominant literature dealing with regional security, focusing in particular on the Copenhagen School. Second, it raises issues that are relevant to the discussion of the Western Mediterranean as a security complex with special reference to the current questions and dilemmas that are plaguing relations in the region at the economic, political, societal/social, military and environmental levels. Then it seeks to relate them to the nature of the Western Mediterranean as a new genre of security complex, a liaison security complex. Finally, it evaluates the importance of liaison security complexes and judges their merits in reconciling some of the problems and difficulties encountered on account of the interdependence that exists, often increasingly today, between higher-level and lower-level security complexes...|$|E

In turn, longer migration correlates with lower reproductive success in both populations. In spoonbills, this effect is most pronounced in older male birds, while young individuals show little difference in breeding success with respect to migration distance.
