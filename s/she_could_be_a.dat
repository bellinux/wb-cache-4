5|$|Governor David Paterson's {{selection}} process {{began with a}} number of prominent names and high-ranking New York Democrats, including Andrew Cuomo, Fran Drescher and Caroline Kennedy, vying for the spot. Gillibrand quietly campaigned for the position, meeting secretly with Paterson on at least one occasion. She said that she made an effort to underscore her successful House elections in a largely conservative district, adding that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good complement to Chuck Schumer. Gillibrand was presumed a likely choice {{in the days before the}} official announcement. On January 23, 2009, Paterson held a press conference to announce Gillibrand as his choice.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Hepburn filmed The African Queen, {{her first}} movie in Technicolor. She played Rose Sayer, a prim {{spinster}} missionary living in German East Africa at {{the outbreak of}} World War I. Costarring Humphrey Bogart, The African Queen was shot mostly on location in the Belgian Congo, an opportunity Hepburn embraced. It proved a difficult experience, however, and Hepburn became ill with dysentery during filming. Later in life, she released a memoir about the experience. The movie was released {{at the end of}} 1951 to popular support and critical acclaim, and gave Hepburn her fifth Best Actress nomination at the Academy Awards. The first successful film she had made without Tracy since The Philadelphia Story a decade earlier, it proved that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> hit without him and fully reestablished her popularity.|$|E

5|$|The {{sex scenes}} were choreographed by feminist writer and sex {{educator}} Susie Bright. The Wachowskis were fans of Bright {{and sent her}} {{a copy of the}} script with a letter asking her to be an extra in the film. When she read the script she loved it, particularly as it was about women enjoying having sex and not apologizing for it. Disappointed that they never described exactly {{what was happening in the}} sex scenes, she asked if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> sex consultant for the film and they agreed. The main sex scene set in Corky's apartment was filmed in one long shot. The Wachowskis believed that this would look more realistic than several shots edited together. Although it should have been a closed set, there were actually many people present, moving the walls of the set in order to allow full movement of the camera around the actors.|$|E

25|$|According to one {{hypothesis}} {{there was}} another daughter of Mieszko, married to a Pomeranian Slavic Prince; <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> daughter of Dobrawa or {{of one of the}} previous pagan wives. Also, a theory exists (apparently based on Thietmar and supported by Oswald Balzer in 1895) that Vladivoj, who ruled as Duke of Bohemia in 1002–1003, was a son of Mieszko and Dobrawa. Although most modern historians reject this claim, Bohemian historiography supported the Piast parentage of Vladivoj.|$|E
500|$|Pollin finds no {{evidence}} that Imlay had been refused a position at her aunts' school, only that such a scheme may have been [...] "in contemplation", as Godwin later wrote, although Seymour grants this explanation some plausibility. St Clair claims that Imlay {{was on her way}} to join her maternal aunts in Ireland when she decided to commit suicide. He believes that it was to be a probationary visit, to see if <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> teacher in their school. Godwin's modern biographer, Richard Holmes, dismisses this story.|$|E

2500|$|Not {{only did}} Dunham {{shed light on}} the {{cultural}} value of black dance, but she clearly contributed to changing perceptions of blacks in America by showing society that as <b>a</b> black woman, <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> intelligent scholar, a beautiful dancer, and a skilled choreographer. As Julia Foulkes pointed out, [...] "Dunham's path to success lay in making high art in the United States from African and Caribbean sources, capitalizing on a heritage of dance within the African Diaspora, and raising perceptions of African American capabilities." ...|$|R
500|$|... "She {{was unhappy}} with the whole damn thing, so I went in and {{sweetened}} {{up a lot of}} music for her, adding some guitars to 'Lucky Star', some voices, some magic.

500|$|The {{first song}} {{featured}} in the episode is [...] "The Most Beautiful Girl (In the Room)."

Jemaine details his seduction of Sally, describing her as being so beautiful <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> [...] "part-time model".

500|$|The {{identity}} of Jon's mother has created much speculation among {{readers of the}} series, and guessing her identity was the test Martin gave Benioff and Weiss when they approached him in March 2006 about adapting his novels into a TV series. In the novels, Martin hints that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> servant named Wylla, or the noblewoman Ashara Dayne. The popular fan theory—called [...] "R+L=J", an abbreviation of [...] "Rhaegar + Lyanna = Jon"—proposes that Jon is not the son of Ned at all, but is actually the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Ned's younger sister Lyanna Stark.|$|E

500|$|In its anniversary story, Variety {{argued that}} it had benefited all three of its lead actresses. In {{addition}} to Streep's record-setting Oscar nomination, the magazine observed, it had proven that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> box-office draw by herself, opening doors up {{for her to be}} cast as a lead in later summer movies such as Julie & Julia and Mamma Mia!. For Hathaway, it was her first leading role in a film intended for an adult audience. Subsequent producers were impressed that she had held her own playing opposite Streep, which led eventually to her being cast in more serious roles like Rachel Getting Married and Les Misérables, for which she won an Oscar.

500|$|Curry {{stated that}} the [...] "first few drafts of [...] focused on a 12-year-old boy and a mother's trial {{of trying to get}} her son out of this boy's clutches, and gradually, it became {{something}} else". In the original script, Claire was [...] "happily married", but Curry chose to have her separated due to her husband's infidelity, so that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> [...] "more sympathetic character". Curry was influenced by the real-life story of Mary Kay Letourneau, a teacher who became involved with her underage student, causing her to be convicted for rape charges. Director Rob Cohen revealed that in Curry's draft, the character of Noah was younger, but he made the conscious decision to age him to 19, because he felt as if it was [...] "not healthy" [...] and that audiences would lose sympathy for the protagonist. Explaining her character, Lopez stated that Claire was feeling [...] "worthless" [...] after her husband cheated, and [...] "People can understand that. They can understand making a mistake in a moment like that." ...|$|E

Bertha Hill's obituary records [...] "William, Dolly and baby Shirley" [...] and on Shirley's fifth birthday the local Skegness newspaper noted that she invited {{many of her}} friends to her father's holiday camp for her party. Little reference is made to her after this time, and her name is not listed on her father's grave with her still-living siblings. Sandra died in 1976 {{at the age of}} 34 (the same year Butlin's second wife Norah died.) William Jr died of cancer in 2003. Robert took over from his father, running the company from 1968 to 1984, and died of lung cancer on 31 December 2008. Jacquie lives on Jersey, where she runs a clothes shop.

500|$|Rae {{ultimately}} learnt of the affair; Richardson characterised {{her response}} as being [...] "shocked and angry", and Barlow told Inside Soap magazine that the revelation left her character [...] "more torn than ever." [...] The discovery prompted Rae to consider having an abortion, but Brendan convinced her not to, and {{revealed that he}} once lost his own child. Barlow called the scenes [...] "really heartfelt stuff", and explained that Ste saw no problem with Rae having the baby, as he already had a son and considered himself a good father, whereas it was [...] "a bigger deal" [...] for Rae, who was childless. Discussing Rae and Ste's relationship, Barlow said that Rae truly loved Ste, {{and that they had}} a special connection formed through the hardships they had faced together. Despite this, Rae rebuffed Ste's attempt to rekindle their relationship. Barlow said that her character could not return to Ste because she knew that he was gay, that Rae was [...] "determined to keep the baby" [...] and wanted to prove that <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good single mother. However, during an argument with Brendan, Rae suffered a miscarriage. Barlow found the filming of these scenes difficult.|$|E
