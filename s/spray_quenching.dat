In comparison with other cooling systems, there are many process parameters involved in <b>spray</b> <b>quenching,</b> which make it versatile, effective and able to adapt the quenching upon different cross sections of heavy parts. Simulation can represent a useful tool in properly designing the spray process for a specific forging and its reliability depends on the proper definition of input data, in particular of the heat transfer coefficient between the water and the part. Volumetric spray flux has been proposed as one of the preeminent factors on determining the heat transfer coefficient during <b>spray</b> <b>quenching,</b> in industrial processes, the volumetric spray flux is affected by the overlap of sprays on the forging surface due to the use of multi-nozzles systems.

40|$|AbstractAluminum allay A 6061 is {{commonly}} applied T 6 heat treatment and {{ultimate tensile strength}} above 300 MPa is obtained by solid solution strengthening. The T 6 treatment consists of solution treatment, water quenching and artificial aging. Lower cooling rate during quenching is very important because impurity phase deposition in solution phasedue to longer quenching delay results in growth of grains in the aging process and less strengthening. The quenching delay time strongly depends on boiling transition from film boiling to nucleate boiling as well as heat capacity of the solid. Stable wetted situation hardly occurs in the film boiling region and film boiling heat transfer coefficient is one or two digit {{lower than that of}} the nucleate boilingheat transfer. In this research, dip (bath) and <b>spray</b> <b>quenches</b> were applied to thick A 6061 hollow cylinders to get comparable spray cooling rate with the conventional dip quenching. Temperature histories in the cylinder were measured during quenching and inside temperature distribution was estimated with inverse heat conduction analysis. After the T 6 treatment, tensile test pieces were cut away from the cylinder and effectiveness of the <b>spray</b> <b>quench</b> was accessed. The spray quenchingtests were done for water temperature of 10 - 22 oC and the maximum total spray flow rate of 20 L/min with four or eight spray nozzles around the cylinder. For the dip quenching, test piece was soaked into well stirred water pool at a fixed temperature of 18 oC. From the <b>spray</b> quenchtests, the <b>quenching</b> delay time was difficult to keep within the allowable maximum delay time requested from existing metallurgical studies. It was found that higher water flow rate or larger number of nozzle arrangement will be required to obtain comparable cooling rate with the dip quenching result.

5000|$|In {{traverse}} hardening systems {{the work}} piece is passed through the induction coil progressively and a following <b>quench</b> <b>spray</b> or ring is utilised. Traverse hardening is used extensively {{in the production of}} shaft type components such as axle shafts, excavator bucket pins, steering components, power tool shafts and drive shafts. The component is fed through a ring type inductor which normally features a single turn. The width of the turn is dictated by the traverse speed, the available power and frequency of the generator. This creates a moving band of heat which when quenched creates the hardened surface layer. The quench ring can be either integral a following arrangement or a combination of both subject to the requirements of the application. By varying speed and power it is possible to create a shaft which is hardened along its whole length or just in specific areas and also to harden shafts with steps in diameter or splines.

40|$|Heat-treating {{of solid}} alloy {{cylinders}} and tubes {{is an important}} practical problem for which no optimal production methods have been developed, {{especially in terms of}} the most crucial quenching stage. This study explores the use of <b>spray</b> <b>quenching</b> {{as an alternative to the}} commonly used bath quenching, which is known to yield relatively slow quench rates and provide few options for spatial optimization of cooling rate. A carefully configured spray cooling system is examined, which provides maximum coverage of the surface of a solid alloy cylinder and that of an alloy tube with full-cone pressure sprays. A new analytical model is derived to determine the shape and size of the spray impact zone, as well as the distribution of volumetric flux across the curved surface of the cylinder and tube. This distribution is combined with heat transfer correlations for all spray boiling regimes to generate a local boiling curve for every location across the impact surface. Using these boiling curves as boundary conditions, a transient analysis is conducted for aluminum alloy and steel cylinders and tubes. Increasing the nozzle pressure drop or decreasing the orifice-to-surface distance are shown to hasten the exit from the poor film boiling regime to the more efficient transition boiling regime, resulting in a quicker quench. Relatively high thermal diffusivity causes faster transmission of the spray cooling effect through the curved surface and milder temperature gradients in aluminum compared to steel. This also causes the outer surface to cool earlier but deeper points much slower for steel. Large temperature gradients are encountered on the surface during the quench because of different boiling regimes occurring at different locations exposed to the spray. This study highlights several practical advantages of <b>spray</b> <b>quenching</b> compared with bath quenching, including the ability to achieve a wide range of fast quench rates, uniformity and predictability of quench rate, and the ability to predict and guard against imperfections caused by thermal stresses. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper dwells on {{the nature}} of the highly {{non-linear}} interactions occurring during heat treatments with the aim of developing an improved understanding of the process and of the residual strains and stresses formed in heat-treated components during processing. As an example, two industrial quench processes are analysed. A general analytical strategy is presented to study not only these processes, but is formulated in such a way that it may also be extended to other thermomechanical processes. This strategy may therefore serve as a roadmap for industrial designers to analyse thermomechanical processes for optimization. Results in the broad framework of thermomechanical processing indicate that careful characterization and correct representation of the heat transfer conditions leads to significant improvements in accuracy over the current quench modelling techniques. In addition to this, the nature of the thermomechanics involved in <b>spray</b> and bath <b>quench</b> processes is analysed. Neutron diffraction experiments and finite element analyses indicate that the use of water sprays reduces the depth of permanent deformation in quenched components compared to those treated in a water bath.

In this contribution, we investigate an attractive technological alternative to recombine SiO 2 and ZrO 2 into ZrSiO 4 by laser treatment with a scanning continuous wave CO 2 laser. By carefully adjusting the CO 2 laser treatment parameters (laser power density and scanning velocity), we show that the SiO 2 and ZrO 2 phases indeed recombine into ZrSiO 4, however, with a very low recombination rate. Thus, we have investigated the addition of SiO 2 -rich glassy particles to the plasma spray powders to facilitate the recombination of ZrO 2, and SiO 2 into ZrSiO 4 during the laser treatment. Furthermore, the beneficial role of the glassy particles addition to substantially lower the annealing temperature during classical heat treatments has been studied.

Typically one would begin with known (or at least postulated) microscopic flow relations that hold on the “small” scale. These include continuum level conservation of mass, balance of species mass and momentum, conservation of energy, and a statement of the second law of thermodynamics often {{in the form of}} an entropy inequality (such as the Clausius-Duhem inequality). The averaged or macroscopic conservation equations and entropy inequalities are then obtained from the microscopic equations through suitable averaging procedures. At this stage a stronger form of the second law may also be postulated for the mixture of phases or materials. To render the evolutionary material flow balance system unique, constitutive equations and phase or material interaction relations are introduced from experimental observation, or by postulation, through strict enforcement of the constraints or restrictions resulting from the averaged entropy inequalities. These averaged equations form the governing equation system for the dynamic evolution of these mixture flows. Most commonly, the averaging technique utilized is either volume or time averaging or a combination of the two. The flow restrictions required for volume and time averaging to be valid can be severe, and violations of these restrictions are often found. A more general, less restrictive (and far less commonly used) type of averaging known as ensemble averaging can also be used to produce the governing equation systems. In fact volume and time averaging can be viewed as special cases of ensemble averaging. Ensemble averaging is beginning to gain some notice, for example the general-purpose multi-material flow simulation code CFDLib under continuing developed at the Los Alamos National Laboratory [Kashiwa and Rauenzahn 1994] is based on an ensemble averaged formulation. The purpose of this short note is to give an introduction to the ensemble averaging methodology and to show how ensemble averaged balance equations and entropy inequality can be obtained from the microscopic balances. It then details some seven-equation, two-pressure, two-velocity hyperbolic, well-posed models for two-phase flows.

40|$|Research was {{undertaken}} {{to determine if}} Low Carbon Bainitic-Martensitic (LCBM) steels {{can be used as}} railway wheels since they are expected to provide significant benefits both in longer life and improved performance compared with conventional pearlitic-ferritic steels. Railway wheel standards require that compressive stresses are formed in the tread region of as- manufactured railway wheels to retard the initiation and propagation of cracks due to fatigue. However, when LCBM railway wheels are produced in a similar fashion as pearlitic-ferritic railway wheels, unfavourable tensile residual stresses are formed in the tread region rendering this process unsuitable. Dilatometric studies were undertaken to characterise the strains associated with volumetric changes during austenite to martensite phase transformation in LCBM steels. The results were incorporated in a thermo-mechanical Finite Element (FE) model to study changes in microstructure and stress distribution in LCBM railway wheels for different quenching conditions and configurations. A novel quenching method was developed and found to give the desired compressive residual stresses in the tread region of LCBM wheels. Experiments were undertaken to verify the predictions of the FE model which relied on estimated Heat Transfer Coefficients (HTCs). A full-size experimental railway wheel quenching rig was constructed and embedded with thermocouples to measure cooling rates in various locations of a LCBM wheel for different quenching conditions. Experimental values of HTCs were determined for different <b>quenching</b> <b>spray</b> intensities and the novel quenching process was optimised by preferentially quenching selected regions of the wheel and evaluating different spray intensities. vi Residual stress measurements were undertaken to confirm the presence of compressive stresses in the tread region of LCBM railway wheels, thereby validating the novel quenching process. The risks of quench cracking in LCBM railway wheels were investigated and the results showed that adopting a low coolant spray intensity with a low carbon grade LCBM steel is expected to reduce the likelihood of quench cracking without adversely affecting standard wheel requirements for compressive stresses in the tread region. A crack growth model was also developed to investigate the fatigue performance of LCBM railway wheels produced using this novel quenching process. The level and distribution of as- manufactured rim residual stresses were shown {{to play an important role}} in retarding stress reversal due to thermal stresses from tread braking. Under similar service loadings, LCBM wheels were found to possess longer fatigue lives (by approx. 50 %) compared to conventional pearlitic-ferritic wheels. There is potential for wider applications of LCBM steels if quenching processes can be developed to promote compressive stresses in fatigue prone regions. A critical review of large gear failures and mechanical requirements concluded that steels with good hardenability, core strength and toughness are beneficial for use in large gears. The FE model was used to develop a two-stage quenching process for LCBM large gears and the compressive stresses at the base of the teeth of the gear were predicted to exceed those of conventional induction hardened SAE gear steels, potentially extending the life and performance of large gears...|$|R

Thermal data was acquired through K-type thermocouples placed in the sample at three positions, 1 mm below surface, mid-radius and at center of the specimen, connected to a data acquisition system. High thermal gradients were observed in both systems, being the high-speed chamber the severest cooling. The maximum cooling rate obtained at the surface was 470 and 300 °C/s for the high-speed chamber and the spray system, respectively. In addition, 5160 spring steel samples were quenched for short times in both systems; the cooling was interrupted to avoid through transformation and to produce a case-core type microstructure. Different cooling times were used for the interrupted quenching to modify the martensite case thickness. No cracks were observed. Thermal results and microstructures are discussed...|$|E

This paper discusses the residual deformation modelling of a complex shaped stainless steel AISI 316 L component heated to 900 C and quenched with a water spray subcooled to 80 K. The paper shows that accurate deformation modelling of the problem necessitates not only an adequate mathematical formulation of the physical system but also the application of precise thermal and mechanical boundary conditions. Correlations of experimentally measured spatio-temporal heat transfer coefficients found valid for spray Reynolds numbers, Res  Gdd  f, of 6 × 10 - 2 < Re < 3 and spray Weber numbers, 2 s d f We  G d  , of 4. 6 × 10 - 7 < We < 4. 1 × 10 - 2 used in the calculation are presented. These boundary conditions are used in a finite element model (FEM) to enable predictions of the deformation history of a complex geometry subjected to <b>spray</b> <b>quenching.</b> The results of the modelling are compared to the deformed shape of the processed component. The excellent agreement between the modelling and experiment suggest that the method used to analyse this problem is consistent and may be applied to determine the residual stress and strain formation of complex shaped components subjected to a spray quench with great accuracy. The {{results of this study}} provide the opportunity to do life assessments with reliable residual stress and strain predictions which may be applied to components such as electronic chips, aluminium extrusions or metal sheet rollers. dc 201...|$|E
40|$|Gas {{quenching}} {{has been}} known for centuries as a convenient, affordable method to heat treat ferrous alloys. Heated parts are taken out of the furnace and quenched at ambient pressure, casually using a blower to increase the heat exchange. Technical developments in the metal industry, over the last decades, have seen a constant improvement of the ratio of heat exchange, e. g. by using pressured chambers, specific blowers, and a variety of gases and gas mixtures. The current gas quenching technologies are adapted to heat treatable metals found in the automotive industry, requesting a minimum heat exchange ratio, also depending on the part geometry. Little has been however investigated concerning the quenched batch, defined as the arrangement of the heated parts onto a single- or multiple-layer charge carrier. The present work, through a combination of experimental and numerical techniques, provides guidelines to adapt the batch to a specific gas flow pattern (spatial fitting), and to adapt the gas flow pattern to the batch structure (temporal fitting). Measurement techniques have been developed to assess the flow patterns inside industrial quenching chambers. Evaluated flow structures have been converted to numerical boundary conditions for extended simulations tools. Simulations have helped implementing technical solutions for flow correction in industrial gas quenching chambers. Furthermore, simulations have served the design of batches of various geometries, to improve both quenching homogeneity and intensity. Both experimental and numerical results confirmed the advantages of gas quenching for the homogeneous heat treatment of automotive steel grades, and demonstrated the potential of various flow correcting devices, such as perforated plates and cylindrical flow ducts. Heat treatment gas and <b>spray</b> <b>quenching</b> has also been integrated into the forging and the turning process chains of single components, successfully optimizing the lean process flow (automation, quality, and time), for various high-performance materials and part geometries...|$|E
