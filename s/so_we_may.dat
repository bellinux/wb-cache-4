5|$|The {{dimensions}} of Christian meditation develop from God's having completed his self-revelation in two directions: Speaking {{out of his}} own, and speaking as a man, through his Son, disclosing the depths of man.... And this meditation can take place only where the revealing man, God's Son, Jesus Christ, reveals God as his Father: in the Holy Spirit of God, <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> join in probing God's depths, which only God's Spirit probes.|$|E
25|$|Part four charts {{the task}} ahead, which Unger says {{is to find}} the {{collective}} equivalents to the personal experiences of love, faith, and hope. We must strive to discover the structures that can realize these passions in the everyday world. All too often visions of the future human and environment exclude from social life the personal connections represented in the passions, choosing instead to focus on the recreation of the material world. Unger’s call, however, is to take full account of the passions <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> transcend our context and become more godlike.|$|E

He was offering a 19th century imperialist vision and [...] "Lazer Beam" [...] offers an end to Hollywood romantic comedies and imperial colonialist bastards".

500|$|The old [...] "Painter's Passage", {{parallel}} to the South Drawing Room was renovated after the Second World War when glass cases were installed along its length to showcase the Spencer crockery, {{with a range of}} porcelain including Meissen, Sèvres, Kangxi, Chelsea and Derby pieces. Charles Spencer remarked that his grandfather Albert was trying to say, [...] "This part of Althorp will never be lived in again; <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> as well use it to show off the treasures in an orderly way". Today, most of the collection has been moved to the China Museum which lies {{on the east side of}} the house, between the Sutherland Room and the Great Dining Room, and the passage now contains a series of busts and paintings in its place, including a self-portrait of Sofonisba Anguisciola, and portraits of the dramatist Molière and the actor David Garrick. Charles Spencer highlights a pair of late 17th century blue and white tulipieres, special vases to hold tulips which were fashionable at the time, as his favourite in the museum.|$|E

2500|$|Set in the {{critical}} year of 1945, this novel focuses on farmer Mat Feltner's struggle over the news that his son Virgil has been listed as missing in action while also telling multiple tales {{of the lives of}} other Port William residents, such as Burley Coulter, Jack Beechum, Ernest Finley, Ida and Gideon Crop. Reprinting by North Point Press in 1983 allowed Berry to radically revise the novel, removing almost a third of its original length. Jeffrey Bilbro believes that these substantial changes marked growth in Berry's approach. [...] "In Berry's revised edition, his technique caught up with his subject. He allows us, as readers, to participate in the ignorance of his characters, and in doing <b>so,</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> be able to understand more fully the painful difficulty of choosing fidelity to the natural order while living in the midst of mystery." ...|$|E
2500|$|A third {{uprising}} {{took place}} in December 1988. This time the uprising was led by Lieutenant-Colonel Mohammed Alí Seineldín and was supported by 1,000 rebel troops. This uprising proved successful. Several of the demands of Seineldin and his followers were met. Caridi was forced into retirement and replaced by General Francisco Gassino, who {{had served in the}} Falklands/Malvinas War and was held in high esteem by the carapintadas. On 5 October 1989 as part of a sweeping reform, the newly elected president, Carlos Menem, pardoned those convicted in the human right trials and the rebel leaders imprisoned for taking part in the military uprisings. Menem also pardoned the leftist guerrilla commanders accused of terrorism. In a televised address to the nation, President Menem said, [...] "I have signed the decrees <b>so</b> <b>we</b> <b>may</b> begin to rebuild the country in peace, in liberty and in justice ...
