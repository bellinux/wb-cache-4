5|$|On 14 February 1879, Chilean forces entered Antofagasta to {{the welcome}} {{of most of}} the local population, {{beginning}} the War of the Pacific against Bolivia and Peru. Many locals enlisted in the Chilean Army, and Morales enlisted as a soldier to avenge her husband by disguising herself as a man and <b>slipping</b> <b>in</b> unnoticed amid the frenzy of patriotism.|$|E
5|$|The P90 can {{be fitted}} with a sling for greater ease of carry, and since the weapon has a fixed stock (as opposed to having a {{collapsing}} or folding stock), it can be quickly deployed when needed. The weapon's smooth, rounded contours prevent it from snagging on the shooter's clothing or equipment, and a small vertical protrusion is provided at {{the front end of}} the weapon's frame to prevent the shooter's hand from accidentally <b>slipping</b> <b>in</b> front of the muzzle while shooting. A hollow compartment inside the rear of the weapon's frame—accessed by removing the buttplate—allows for convenient storage of a cleaning kit.|$|E

25|$|Returning to Watkins Glen, Ambrose started {{fifth and}} {{dominated}} {{part of the}} race but was passed in a three-wide move by Kyle Busch with 20 laps remaining. When the white flag was about to wave he saw that Busch was <b>slipping</b> <b>in</b> oil; in {{the entrance to the}} esses he and Brad Keselowski passed him; Ambrose then saw that Keselowski was <b>slipping</b> <b>in</b> oil too and he took the lead in the final turn, holding off Keselowski {{for the second time in}} a row and defending his win from the previous year. Ambrose was very emotional about his win due to his father seeing it on television in a hospital for an illness and due to his luck that day. The win moved Ambrose up one position in the standings from 18th to 17th. Ambrose still has promised the racing world for a future oval win since his #1 goal currently is to prove he can win at places other than road courses.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fourth}} quarter of 2012, Dell and Hewlett Packard came under {{pressure}} from Asian PC manufacturers Lenovo, Asus, and Acer, all of which had lower production costs and willing to accept lower profit margins. In addition, while the Asian PC vendors had been improving their quality and design, Dell's customer service and reputation had been <b>slipping.</b> <b>In</b> {{the fourth quarter}} of 2012, Dell remained the second-most profitable PC vendor, as it took 13% of operating profits in the PC industry, behind Apple Inc.'s Macintosh that took 45%, 7% at Hewlett Packard, 6% at Lenovo and Asus, and 1% for Acer.|$|E

25|$|His procedure, {{widely known}} as the Nuss procedure, {{involves}} <b>slipping</b> <b>in</b> one or more concave steel bars into the chest, underneath the sternum. The bar is flipped to a convex position so as to push outward on the sternum, correcting the deformity. The bar usually stays in the body for about two years, although many surgeons are now moving toward leaving them in {{for up to five}} years. When the bones have solidified into place, the bar is removed through outpatient surgery. Although initially designed to be performed in younger children (less than 10 years of age) whose sternum and cartilage is more flexible, there are successful series of Nuss treatment in patients well into their teens and twenties. The Nuss procedure is a two-stage procedure.|$|E
25|$|At the party's 1981 convention, 33.5% of {{the delegates}} {{supported}} a leadership review; they felt that Clark {{would not be able}} to lead the party to victory again. At the January 1983 convention in Winnipeg, 33.1% supported a review. The fact that Clark had been able to increase his support among party members by only 0.4% was likely a contributing factor to his decision to resign as leader and seek a renewed mandate from the membership through a leadership convention. This was also considering that the governing Liberals under Pierre Trudeau were <b>slipping</b> <b>in</b> polls, and although the PCs had built up a substantial lead in popularity, Trudeau was expected to retire before the election and a new Liberal leader could have been able to pull off a victory.|$|E
25|$|The Buccaneers and St. Louis Rams renewed a rivalry {{that was}} popular from 1999–2004. The {{early part of}} the game was a field {{position}} battle, with Rams running back Steven Jackson rushing effectively in the first half. All of St. Louis' first half drives, however, came up empty on the scoreboard. Tampa Bay's first quarter drivers were also scoreless, with kicker Matt Bryant missing a 54-yard field goal short after <b>slipping</b> <b>in</b> the damp grass. Just before the two-minute warning, Rams kicker Jeff Wilkins missed a 42-yard field goal, setting up Tampa Bay's first score. After driving to the 17-yard line, a heavy downpour drenched the stadium. Matt Bryant connected on 27-yard field goal for the game's first points and concluded the first half. Tampa Bay received the second half kickoff, and rolled into the endzone with a 7-yard touchdown run by Carnell Williams. St. Louis drove to the Tampa Bay 10-yard line, aided by two uncharactaristic defensive penalties by Derrick Brooks (late hit) and Ronde Barber (taunting). The threat was moot, however, as Phillip Buchanon intercepted Marc Bulger in the endzone. In the fourth quarter, Carnell Williams, aggravated his sore ribs, and fumbled the ball while Oshiomogho Atogwe recovered for St. Louis. The Rams finally got on the scoreboard with a 25-yard field goal, narrowing the lead to 10–3 with 12 minutes to play. Back up running back Earnest Graham took over for Williams, and iced the game with two rushing touchdowns, the first of his career outside of the preseason.|$|E
25|$|Peat {{is common}} {{on the islands}} and has {{traditionally}} been exploited as a fuel. Uncontrolled exploitation of this natural resource led to peat <b>slips</b> <b>in</b> 1878 and 1886.

500|$|Despite these {{critical}} successes, in 1996, World News Tonight started gradually <b>slipping</b> <b>in</b> {{the ratings}} race. Bolstered by strong viewership of {{its coverage of}} the 1996 Summer Olympic Games, NBC's Nightly News overtook the ABC newscast for two weeks in late July and early September. This short bump provided momentum for NBC, which started making steady gains in the ratings. Worried, Jennings and ABC decided {{to cut back on}} international reporting and give more air time to [...] "soft stories", in an effort to emulate the success of Nightly News. The changes provoked a backlash from regular viewers, and ratings plummeted. [...] "We did very badly with it," [...] Jennings said. [...] "The audience kicked us in the teeth." [...] Although changes were made to World News Tonight to restore its luster and stop the hemorrhaging, Nightly News ended 1997 as the number-one evening newscast.|$|E
500|$|As Artest {{walked out}} of the stands, he was confronted by two more fans, Alvin [...] "A.J." [...] Shackleford and Charlie Haddad, who ran onto the court. Artest punched Shackleford in the face, causing Haddad to {{intervene}} by pushing away Artest, before both fans fell over. While Haddad was on the ground, Anthony Johnson struck him {{in the back of the}} head. As Haddad stood up, Jermaine O'Neal punched him in the jaw after a running start, while <b>slipping</b> <b>in</b> liquid and falling backwards, causing witnesses Scot Pollard, ESPN sideline reporter Jim Gray, and a Pistons executive, Tom Wilson, to briefly fear that O'Neal would kill Haddad. O'Neal later claimed that Haddad had been asked to leave the arena earlier that night, and was well-known to security because of claims that he wanted to fight an NBA player in order to receive compensation. William Wesley, Austin Croshere, and Miller pulled Artest away from the fans, but the scene became chaotic as outnumbered arena security struggled to reestablish order. Although Auburn Hills police had plans to handle many disorders, and had three officers in the arena, they were unprepared for players entering the stands.|$|E
500|$|Many {{specimens}} also {{accumulated in}} natural traps, such as sinkholes and tar pits. The Hot Springs Mammoth Site in South Dakota is a 26,000-year-old, approximately -long sinkhole that functioned for 300 to 700 years before filling with sediment. The site {{is the opposite}} scenario of that in Waco; {{all but one of}} the at least 55 skeletons—additional skeletons are excavated each year—are male, and accumulated over time rather than in a single event. It is assumed that like modern male elephants, male mammoths primarily lived alone, were more adventurous (especially young males) and more likely to encounter dangerous situations than the females. The mammoths may have been lured to the hole by warm water or vegetation near the edges, <b>slipping</b> <b>in</b> and drowning or starving. Isotope studies of growth rings have shown that most of the mammoths died during spring and summer, which may have correlated with vegetation near the sinkhole. One individual, nicknamed [...] "Murray", lies on its side, and probably died in this pose while struggling to get free. Deep footprints of mammoths attempting to free themselves from the sinkhole's mud can be seen in vertically-excavated sections of the site.|$|E

500|$|Dougan {{was signed}} by Aston Villa in July 1961 for a fee of £15,000. He {{was signed by}} manager Joe Mercer as a {{replacement}} for Gerry Hitchens, who had been sold on to Inter Milan earlier in the summer for £85,000. Teammate Peter McParland later commented that [...] "when Derek came to us at Aston Villa I think it was {{at a time when he}} was not taking the game particularly seriously". After returning from watching his [...] "Villans" [...] teammates win the 1961 League Cup Final at Villa Park on 5 September, Dougan was a passenger in a car accident which killed fellow passenger Malcolm Williams and left Dougan with a broken arm and head injuries; driver and teammate Bobby Thomson was charged but found 'Not Guilty' of careless driving. In November 2010 – three years after Dougan's death, Thomson claimed that Dougan had drunkenly pulled a deerstalker hat over his eyes, causing him to crash the car. Dougan recovered after three months on the sidelines and ended the 1961–62 season with 12 goals in 27 matches. He twisted his knee midway through the 1962–63 campaign after <b>slipping</b> <b>in</b> the street, and ended the season with 14 goals from 33 games.|$|E

Brown began <b>slipping</b> <b>in</b> and out of consciousness, {{but in spite of}} being in great pain, did not complain to Hudner. A rescue helicopter arrived around 15:00, and Hudner and its pilot, Lieutenant Charles Ward, were unable to put out the engine fire with a fire extinguisher and tried {{in vain to}} free Brown with an axe for 45 minutes. They briefly considered, at Brown's request, amputating his trapped leg. Brown lost consciousness for the last time shortly thereafter. His last known words, which he told Hudner, were [...] "tell Daisy I love her." [...] The helicopter, which was unable to operate in the darkness, was forced to leave at nightfall with Hudner, leaving Brown behind. Brown is believed to have died shortly thereafter of his injuries and exposure to the extreme cold. No Chinese forces threatened the site, likely because of the heavy air presence of the VF-32 pilots.|$|E

500|$|Marvel Comics' {{incorporation}} of LGBT themes has been unfavorably {{compared with that}} of DC; its use of gay characters has been described as [...] "less prolific but more deliberate". Marvel reportedly had a [...] "No Gays in the Marvel Universe" [...] policy during Jim Shooter's 1980s tenure, and Marvel's policy from the 1990s had stated that all series emphasizing solo gay characters must carry an [...] "Adults Only" [...] label, in response to conservative protests. However, these policies did not stop creators from <b>slipping</b> <b>in</b> gay characters and themes; J.M. DeMatteis introduced Arnie Roth, a childhood friend of Steve Rogers, who comes to Cap seeking help in rescuing his [...] "roommate" [...] Michael. Later, Arnie himself is captured by Baron Zemo and forced to dress in flamboyant clothes and stage make-up and give a speech about how his love for Michael is false and unnatural. Cap rescues Arnie and reassures him that his love for Michael is as genuine as Cap's own love for his girlfriend, Sharon. The story appears to have gone under the radar purely because DeMatteis did not use the word [...] "gay". Subsequent official character biographies have confirmed Arnie Roth as gay. As of 2006, these policies are no longer enforced and LGBT characters appear regularly in Marvel comics. Although same-sex couples are depicted occasionally kissing, intimate or sexual scenes have not been shown, even in Marvel's [...] "Adult only" [...] imprint. The use of mutants and the discrimination they face in the X-Men comics has been seen {{as a metaphor for the}} real-world discrimination directed at minority groups including LGBT people.|$|E
