In the first variant, the forwarder was first used for extracting industrial roundwood, and then for all the remaining parts of the tree as energy wood. The second method was the common practice, i. e. the forwarder was used for transporting industrial roundwood and large logs, {{and then in the}} second phase 1 -m firewood was processed from the remaining part of the tree, and it was extracted by the tractor assembly. In the third phase, the prepared (bunched) biomass was extracted by the forwarder. Environmental viability of the forwarder and tractor assembly for 1 -m firewood was analyzed based on CI*NGP– 1 ratio, i. e. index that represents the ratio between soil bearing strength, as the soil characteristics, and nominal wheel load, as the vehicle characteristics, so that it has a clear physical sense. This factor has been chosen because it consists of values that can be measured relatively easily or calculated with the use of semi-empirical models. The obtained values were compared with the recommended limit values from EcoWood project, which were based on the allowed 10 -cm depth of the wheel rut. The analysis showed that the reference wheel of the tractor assembly semitrailer was the most unfavorable and that no environmentally viable wood extraction can be expected from such a vehicle, but only economic mobility. This is why the use of a non-drive bogie axle is recommended for them. The wheels of the farming tractor have the most favorable indicators of environmental viability, and particularly so the front wheels, whose load gets considerably lower with the increase of the semitrailer load. The indicators of the forwarder are considerably better, and however in this case, too, for achieving an environmentally acceptable maneuverability, according to EcoWood classification, the soil must be very strong with the cone index between 700 kPa for ~ 50 % load and up to 900 kPa for the nominal load value. During measurement and analysis of results, great dispersion was observed of the measuring data of the soil cone index obtained by cone penetrometer, sampled on a relatively non-homogenous forest soil. Searching for an acceptable measurement procedure by cone penetrometer or the application of any other measuring method for the assessment of the soil bearing strength is a significant task of scientific research. The assessment of the skidder environmental viability will be a still greater challenge, because they are characterized by a considerably more complex travel dynamics than moving on slopes, dynamic redistribution of axle loads, achievement of tractive force, etc. This is also the opinion of Horvat et al. (2007) with the emphasis on the fact that with skidders it is also necessary to analyze the impact of the winched and <b>skidded</b> <b>load</b> on the soil...|$|E

U prvoj je inačici forvarderom izvožena prvo tehnička oblovina, a zatim sav preostali dio stabala kao energijsko drvo. U drugoj se metodi radilo na uobičajen način, tj. prvo se forvarderom transportirala tehnička oblovina i višemetarsko drvo, zatim je od preostaloga dijela stabala izrađeno jednometarsko ogrjevno drvo koje je izvoženo traktorskom ekipažom, a u trećoj je fazi pripremljenu (uhrpanu) biomasu izvozio forvarder. Okolišna pogodnost kretanja tih šumskih vozila po šumskom bespuću ocjenjivana je na temelju prepuruka projekta EcoWood pomoću kvocijenta CI*NGP– 1. Raščlamba je pokazala da je okolišno daleko najnepovoljnija šumska poluprikolica te da njezinu osovinu treba graditi kao bogi. Okolišni pokazatelji forvardera povoljniji su od poluprikolice traktorske ekipaže, no njegovo kretanje po šumskom bespuću zahtijeva tlo visoke čvrstoće. U uvjetima nizinskih šuma, koje odlikuje česta ograničena nosivost tla, to je teško postići.

40|$|Forest {{harvesting}} {{with animals}} is a labor-intensive operation. It is expensive to use machines on smaller woodlots, which require frequent moves if mechanically logged. So, small logging systems using animals {{may be more}} cost effective. In this study, work sampling was used for five animal logging operations in Alabama to measure productive and non-productive time elements to determine utilization with respect to operators, functions (felling and processing of trees, <b>skidding,</b> <b>loading,</b> and forwarding of logs), animals, and machines. Cost of log production was calculated from the figures reported by owners and the crew members. Average utilization of crew was 58 percent, animals (horses and mules) were utilized only 22 percent and the machines were utilized from 5 to 74 percent of scheduled time. Average cost of log production per m 3 was $ 11. 28. There {{appears to be an}} opportunity to reduce cost of log production by coordinating functions, increasing scheduled work hours, utilization of machines and animals, and reducing labor cost.

40|$|Time {{equations}} {{are derived}} for felling with chainsaw, skidding with cable wheeled skidder, loading with grapple hydraulic loader and trucking of logs within a cut-to-length harvesting method. The continuous time study method {{was applied to}} collect data for felling, <b>skidding,</b> <b>loading</b> and a transportation model. Multiple regression analysis via SPSS software was applied to develop the time models. Felling time {{was found to be}} highly dependent on diameter at breast height. Skidding distance, winching distance, slope of the trail and piece volume were significant variables for the skidding time prediction model. The loading time model was developed considering piece volume. Transportation distance and load volume were used as independent variables in modeling the transportation time. The net production of felling was estimated at 12 trees/h (56. 65 m 3 /h). The net production rates for <b>skidding,</b> <b>loading</b> and traveling averaged 18. 51, 41. 90 and 3. 32 m 3 /h respectively. The total cost of harvesting from stand to mill was estimated 19. 70 €/m 3. The skidding phase was the most expensive component of the cut-to-length method. The bucking and delimbing components were less costly than the other logging phases. The results of this study can be used for harvesting planning and productivity optimization...|$|R

40|$|The {{logging system}} {{consists}} of five subsystems; namely, felling, bucking, <b>skidding,</b> <b>loading,</b> and hauling. Productivity of the felling and bucking subsystems depends largely upon {{the skill of}} the men doing the work and can be subjected to a minimum amount of analysis. Skidding represents a materials handling system that is being subjected to {{a great deal of}} technical analysis. Loading and hauling, however, stand in need of investigation. Both are materials handling systems that need analysis of the best equipment for a particular situation. This thesis presents a simulation model that investigates the many variable combinations existing in the loading and hauling subsystems. Development of the model required two steps: (1) identi- fication of the events and activities common to loading and hauling subsystems and (2) definition of owning and operating costs relevant to the two sub-systems. Calculation of relevant costs resulted in the criteria used to compare the numerous variable combinations. The criteria is a ratio of investment to output expressed in dollars per thousand board feet of merchantable timber. Identification of appropriate events and activities allowed use of the simulation language, GASP II, in testing various alternatives. The result of this investigation is a fully developed model capable of testing alternatives of the many logging situations in existence.

To plan the logging optimally considering different logging sites, various harvesting times and machineries under different costs, the modern algorithms have been developed to solve the forestry problems with different constraints. In this paper, firstly the skidding sites were classified considering the slope constraint for wheeled skidder and tractor. Secondly, the <b>skidding</b> cost, <b>loading</b> and secondary transportation costs were computed per cubic meter and road cost for each node of transportation network of logging district considering three destinations. The best solution was found by shortest path algorithm. The results gave the delivery plan, discounted costs and time plan for logging and road construction for each logging site of the a district under selective cutting. These results help forest engineers easily know; (a) where and when they should log the compartments and what roads they need to build, (b) what would be the costs for each logging site and (c) where the logs of each site should be delivered to...|$|R
40|$|Skidder {{mobility}} during timber extraction {{is defined}} by: 1) basic dimensional {{features of the}} vehicle, 2) ability to overcome obstacles during movement, 3) traction performance and 4) environmental soundness. Traction performance depends on the ground conditions (soil bearing capacity) and the total effect of all forces on the vehicle. In downhill skidding, the skidder is under great influence of parallel component of forces, adhesion weight and longitudinal terrain slope, which combined result in negative traction force, torque and thrust force. When the horizontal component of rope force is equal to zero i. e. {{the moment when the}} weight of the load and resistance to traction are in equilibrium, the slope angle α is a function of load mass distribution factor and skidding resistance factor. This is a »turning point« that can be defined as a critical slope because the load starts to push the vehicle downhill, which results in negative horizontal component of rope force. Depending on skidder Ecotrac 120 V dimensional features, centre of gravity, load mass distribution factor, skidding resistance factor of previous research, five different loads were analyzed (1 to 5 tonnes) in order to define the critical slope angle for each of them. Critical slope for downhill skidding of 1 tonne timber is on longitudinal slope of – 26 %, for 2 tonne timber on – 30 %, 3 tonne timber on – 34 %, 4 timber on – 38 % and for 5 tonne timber on – 43 % of terrain longitudinal slope. Even though <b>skidding</b> bigger <b>load</b> increases vehicle mobility to even greater slope angles, the most important in downhill skidding, is to avoid blocking of the wheels, which will lead to a complete vehicle slippage and the driver must be constantly aware of that fact. The general recommendation should be that <b>skidding</b> small <b>loads</b> (1 to 3 tonnes) downhill is suitable for smaller longitudinal terrain slopes (up to maximum – 34 %), while the heavier the load, the further down the slope the skidder can go. The load of 5 tonnes »anchors« the skidder better and therefore it can go on terrain slopes up to – 43 %, during which less traction force is used (torque is used for braking) and skidder pulls the load by its own weight. It can be concluded that extending the operating range of skidder onto steeper slopes with heavier loads has the potential to decrease harvesting costs and increase productivity...|$|R
40|$|Using {{forest biomass}} to {{generate}} energy has been started {{in recent years}} in Australia. There is a pelletizing plant in Western Australia which utilizes some of the forest biomass as source of energy. In this project, a poor quality stand of Eucalyptus with small tree size was harvested with a tracked Tigercat feller buncher. Then the whole trees where extracted by grapple skidder. A chipper was used to chip whole trees into containers of the trucks. Time study method was applied to collect the data to evaluate the production rates for the machines of biomass system. Working delays were recorded in three categories; personal, mechanical and operational delays. Using the multiple regression approach a productivity predicting model was developed. <b>Skidding</b> distance and <b>load</b> weight were significant parameters affecting the productivity of grapple skidder. The results of analysing productive and non-productive time of the equipments indicated that the percentage of the working delays are relatively high which requires more appropriate logistic management.

40|$|Matang Mangrove Forest {{is under}} {{systematic}} management since 1902 and still considered {{as the best}} managed mangrove forest in the world. This research was conducted to measure the time and productivity of forest harvesting operation and also to analyze the cost and revenue of mangrove forest harvesting operation at Matang mangrove forest. This project had been carried out in cooperation with Seri Sepetang Enterprise, one of the harvesting licenses in Kuala Sepetang, Perak. Data collections were taken in every station starting from standing tree until to the Kiln-Drying jetty. The data then calculated by using the formulas of productivity and cost analysis. As the result, the productivity for felling, bucking and debarking, the manual skidding using wheel-barrow and the water transportation are 1. 84 tan/hour, 3. 82 tan/hour and 4. 64 tan/hour respectively. The cost for each operation of 9 tan log volume for felling, bucking and debarking, the manual skidding using wheel-barrow and the water transportation are RM 56. 88, RM 10. 80 and RM 36. 72 respectively. As the revenue, the company paid RM 260 per 9 tan of log for the in-forest operation (felling, manual <b>skidding</b> and <b>loading</b> to the ship) and pay RM 80 per 9 tan for the water transportation, and they gained the net profit of RM 192. 32 and RM 43. 28 respectively. The average of forest harvesting operation is twice operation in a day (equal with 2 x 9 -ton volume of log production a day), so they will gain a double profit. In conclusion, the forest harvesting operation is sustainably managed for supplying the raw material of charcoal industries in Matang mangrove forest. Since, they work manually and spend much energy in this forest harvesting operation, so for further study it recommends to conduct the ergonomics evaluation during forest harvesting operation at Matang Mangrove Forest...|$|R
40|$|Harvest traffic {{with heavy}} {{equipment}} causes damage to forest soils. Whereas increased soil {{damage has been}} reported with increasing harvest equipment traffic and on increasing slope gradients, {{it is unclear how}} much soil damage is caused by different directions of skidding. We examined the effects of traffic frequency, skid trail slope and skidding direction on the dry bulk density and total porosity of skidding trail soil in an Iranian temperate forest. The studied treatments included combinations of three different traffic frequencies (3, 7, and 12 passes of a rubber-tired skidder), three levels of slope (20 %) and two skidding directions (uphill and downhill). The impact on soil properties was greatest during the skidder initial passes. On steep slopes, only three skidder passes were required to cause substantial increases in soil bulk density relative to control plots, regardless of skidding direction. Independently of the traffic frequency and trail slope, uphill skidding caused substantially greater increases in dry bulk density and greater decreases in soil porosity than did downhill skidding. Total porosity was significantly lower on steep slopes than on gentle slopes regardless of traffic intensity and skidding direction. In general, fewer uphill skidder passes were required to achieve substantial soil disturbance than was the case for downhill skidding, possibly because skidders move more slowly when travelling upwards and uphill <b>skidding</b> places greater <b>loads</b> on the skidder rear axle...|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we compare climber {{abundance}} and size in centres of post-logging skid tracks and log loading areas to their adjacent relatively undisturbed border zones, in a selectively logged forest in the west-centre of Me d'Ivoire. We also evaluate the effect of time after logging (age) on these climber parameters. In 19 plots, 3 months to 17 years after logging we counted and measured climber individuals and shoots by species. <b>Skid</b> tracks and <b>loading</b> areas had similar abundance and size of climbers, only the densities of herbaceous species and of pioneer species were both higher in <b>loading</b> areas. <b>Skid</b> tracks had the same abundance and size of climbers as their adjacent border areas. Densities of long climbers (> 3 m length), woody species and non-pioneer species {{were higher in the}} border areas, and densities of herbaceous species and pioneer species were lower, compared to centre areas. With the exception of density of long climbers (higher in the border areas), climber abundance and size in loading areas were similar to those in their adjacent border areas. Climber species richness in skid tracks decreased with time after logging. All other climber parameters studied were not correlated with time after logging. We conclude that despite the mechanical damage in logging related areas most climbers were not much affected, and that time since logging only affects climber species richness in skid tracks.

50|$|The six boats of {{this class}} were {{straight}} forward derivations {{of the later}} boats of the preceding Porpoise class. Although considered {{to be successful in}} most respects, valuable lessons had been learned from the Porpoises and operating experience showed the need to expand the operating envelope. The Salmons were longer, heavier, and faster versions with a better internal arrangement and a heavier armament. Two additional torpedo tubes were added to the aft torpedo room, for a total of four forward and four aft. The development of the Torpedo Data Computer, making broadside attacks practical, had made stern tubes more desirable. Some submariners wanted six tubes forward, but design philosophy and tactics of the day did not yet support this; additionally, for years the tonnage required to provide the extra tubes was over-estimated. However, in an effort {{to increase the number of}} torpedoes carried, four non-firing torpedo stowage tubes were installed in the superstructure below the main deck, stacked vertically, two each on either side of the conning tower. In order to access the weapons in these tubes, the boat had to surface and remove a portion of the decking on either side of the deck gun. Small boats stowed there for running sailors ashore for liberty were removed and set in the water. The weapons were extracted from the tubes one by one and winched up to the main deck. They were then placed on a raised <b>loading</b> <b>skid</b> and carefully lowered on an angle through a hatch into the forward torpedo room. This whole process took several hours to complete. The impracticality of spending several hours on the surface in enemy waters moving torpedoes below was lost on the designers. War experience led to the removal of these tubes during the boats' first wartime overhauls.|$|R
40|$|Several topics {{related to}} lifting {{gantries}} have been studied. These are the modelling of the structure, the structural behaviour of the gantry, the input {{parameters of the}} model and the standards used for the design. A hand calculation model, based on the analysis of built-up compression members in EN 1993 - 1 - 1, has been developed that describes the behaviour of a portal like gantry structure. The model executes geometrically non-linear calculations, that {{take into account the}} second order effects from the deformation of the gantry, and determines the resistance of the gantry based on the axial forces in its chords and on stability checks. Three different mast sections, out of which the gantry columns are made, have been investigated: MSG, DS and NYW. The latter is currently under developed by Mammoet and is called a New York Wheel mast section. The focus is on the application of this section type. The gantry in the model is subject to a vertical load from the self-weight of the mast sections, a vertical load from the weight of the payload and a horizontal point load {{at the top of the}} gantry. The latter accounts for operational loads and wind loads on both the structure and the payload. In the model the horizontal load is expressed as a percentage of the weight of the payload. The resistances obtained from the hand calculation model are within 5 % of the resistances obtained from a numerical benchmark model, for the gantry configurations considered. Therefore, the model is considered accurate enough for a preliminary design. It is able to represent a rigid and a flexible foundations, as well as a hinged and a rigid connection between the columns and beam(s) of the gantry. From the calculations with the hand calculation model several conclusions were drawn. The horizontal load is of large influence for the maximum payload, much larger than the influence of the global imperfection. The difference can easily be between 10 -to- 30 % for the NYW mast sections, between 2 % and 4 % horizontal load. Also, the influence is larger for a gantry with a rigid beam-column connection than for a hinged connection. Calculating with a different imperfection, for example no imperfection instead of 1 / 250 of the gantry height, result in a 6 -to- 10 % resistance difference. The resistance of a gantry with a rigid connection at the top is considerably larger than for a hinged connection, for an asymmetric section like the NYW mast sections. A rigid connection yields a 1. 5 to 4 times higher resistance than a hinged connection, when NYW sections are used on a rigid foundation. The resistance for the three mast section types under consideration has been compared for a rigid foundation. It turns out that for both a hinged and a rigid beam-column connection the NYW sections can bear the highest payload, by far. The resistance to tensile forces, mostly governed by the strength of the connections, is much lower for the MSG sections than for the DS sections. Also, a rigid connection significantly improves the asymmetrical DS sections. For relevant gantry heights the MSG sections can bear a payload that is roughly 50 % of the payload that the DS sections can carry, for a hinged top connection. For a rigid connection it is around 30 %. The DS sections can carry 15 -to- 25 % of the load the NYW sections can carry, for a hinged connection. For a rigid connection it is 25 -to- 35 %. The stiffness of the foundation has been modelled with the method of Pais and Kausel (1988). It appeared that the stiffness of the foundation can have a significant influence on the resistance of the gantry. The MSG sections are more susceptible to a flexible foundation, because of their relatively small base frame. This results in a much smaller rotational stiffness at the bottom of the gantry columns. A foundation on dense sand leads to a resistance decrease around 5 % for the NYW sections and around 35 % for the MSG sections. One of the goals of this thesis was to incorporate the use of guy lines into the model and to investigate their influence on stability, stiffness and ultimately resistance. A preliminary study showed great potential for the use of guy lines. The buckling length can be reduced by around 50 %, almost to the point where a column with a fixed end at the top is resembled. Also, the first order deflection can be reduced significantly, as over 75 % of the horizontal load is taken by the guy lines. This means that the second order effects are drastically reduced. The reduction also has a positive effect on the first order bending moments in the column. A guy line that is installed under a 60 degree angle with the foundation turns out to be effective in both supporting the column and minimizing the gantry footprint. The behaviour of guy lines is highly non-linear. Therefore, it was found challenging to incorporate them in the final hand calculation model accurately. However, the evidence from the preliminary design leads to the recommendation to further investigate the application of guy lines. Several standards have been studied for the design of the gantry. It was concluded that the European crane standard EN 13001 - 1 is best suited to take into account the loads on the structure and that the structural behaviour of the gantry is best described using the European building standard EN 1993 - 1 - 1. The global imperfection of the gantry is a parameter of interest. Mammoet wants to calculate with an imperfection that equals one thousandth of the height of the gantry, since they believe their gantries can be erected with such high precision. The standards under consideration prescribe a larger imperfection, typically 1 / 500. The fabrication and erection tolerances are however much tighter for the mast sections than provided by the standards. Therefore, a smaller imperfection (1 / 1000) can be justified, except for very tall gantries and gantries in storm conditions. The horizontal load on the gantry varies between 2. 5 % and 4 % of the weight of the payload, depending on the direction, the weight of the payload and whether or not <b>skidding</b> of the <b>load</b> is involved. A larger portion of the horizontal load comes from wind loads, of which the load on the object to be lifted is a substantial part. It is therefore recommended to further investigate the wind load.
