40|$|In {{order to}} fulfil the European Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) {{requirements}} for the reduction of energy consumption, European national requirements have been created for building envelope thermal properties and calculation methodology to determine if building energy efficiency is created. This is however not true in all methodologies. The necessity of building air tightness appears only for new A class buildings, {{and there are no}} requirements for air tightness for other building classes. Therefore, the aim of this work is to improve the methodology for the calculation of energy efficiency of buildings, while taking into account the air tightness of the buildings. In order to achieve this aim, the sum energy consumption of investigated buildings was calculated, energy <b>efficiency</b> <b>classes</b> were determined, air tightness of the buildings was measured, and reasons for insufficient air tightness were analyzed. Investigation results show that the average value of air tightness of A energy <b>efficiency</b> <b>class</b> buildings is 0. 6 h− 1. The results of other investigated buildings, corresponding to B and C energy <b>efficiency</b> <b>classes,</b> show insufficient air tightness (the average n 50 value is 6 h− 1); herewith, energy consumption for heating is higher than calculated, according to the energy efficiency methodology.

All measurements have been performed using modern measurement systems based on a personal computer, data acquisition cards and LabVIEW software. According to the measured results for the stray load losses, the efficiency of the induction motor has been calculated. The efficiency obtained has been compared with the IEC standard <b>efficiency</b> <b>classes,</b> in order to determine the <b>efficiency</b> <b>class</b> of the tested motor.
