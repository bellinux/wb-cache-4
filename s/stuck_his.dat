5|$|Glastonbury {{has been}} {{described}} as a New Age community which attracts people with New Age and Neopagan beliefs, and is notable for myths and legends often related to Glastonbury Tor, concerning Joseph of Arimathea, the Holy Grail and King Arthur. Joseph is said to have arrived in Glastonbury and <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> staff into the ground, when it flowered miraculously into the Glastonbury Thorn. The presence of a landscape zodiac around the town has been suggested but no evidence has been discovered. The Glastonbury Festival, held in the nearby village of Pilton, takes its name from the town.|$|E
5|$|Glencross reached several {{milestones}} in the lock-out-shortened 2012–13 season {{en route}} to leading the Flames with 15 goals. After scoring his 100th career goal, he recorded both his 100th assist and 200th point in a 5–4 victory over the Phoenix Coyotes on February 24, 2013. His season was ended prematurely by a knee injury after Anaheim's Ben Lovejoy <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> leg out to cause a knee-on-knee collision. The injury forced Glencross out of the team's final four games of the season.|$|E
5|$|Joseph {{is said to}} {{have arrived}} in Glastonbury by boat over the flooded Somerset Levels. On {{disembarking}} he <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> staff into the ground and it flowered miraculously into the Glastonbury Thorn (or Holy Thorn). This is said to explain a hybrid Crataegus monogyna (hawthorn) tree that only grows within a few miles of Glastonbury, and which flowers twice annually, once in spring and again around Christmas time (depending on the weather). Each year a sprig of thorn is cut, by the local Anglican vicar and the eldest child from St John's School, and sent to the Queen.|$|E

5|$|While Tszyu {{celebrated in}} his corner, Judah was in disbelief of what just {{happened}} and became infuriated. Judah picked up his stool and hurled it towards center ring. While being restrained by his father and trainer, Yoel Judah, he broke loose and walked up to Nady and <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> gloved fist into his neck {{and had to be}} pulled off by cornermen. A few minutes later, Jimmy Lennon, Jr. announced the official decision and Judah screamed out and again had to be restrained by a growing number of security guards and cornermen. Judah was fined $75,000 and suspended for six months by the Nevada State Athletic Commission.|$|E
5|$|A book {{published}} in November 2011, Seal Target Geronimo, by Chuck Pfarrer, a former SEAL, contradicted the account {{as given by}} U.S. government sources. According to Pfarrer, neither helicopter crashed {{at the beginning of}} the raid. Instead, the SEALs jumped onto the roof from the hovering Razor 1 helicopter and entered a third-floor hallway from the roof terrace. Osama's third wife, Khairah, was in the hallway, headed towards the SEALs. She was blinded by a strobe light and pushed to the floor as the SEALs went past her. Osama bin Laden <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> head out of a bedroom door, saw the SEALs, and slammed the door closed. At the same time, Osama's son Khalid bin Laden ran up the stairs to the third floor and was killed with two shots.|$|E
25|$|By all accounts, Smith was a well-respected and even-tempered man. However Bogan's taunts {{began to}} wear on Smith, who {{eventually}} climbed down from his wagon and headed toward Bogan. As Smith walked toward Bogan, the latter <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> hand into his coat. Smith told {{him that if he}} pulled his gun, he'd knock him to the ground. Bogan did pull his pistol, at which point Smith did knock him down with one punch. The two then wrestled briefly before Smith was able to take the young man's gun from him. As he did this, Kemp ran over producing his own handgun, and hit Smith {{in the back of the}} head. Smith then turned and pointed his pistol at Kemp, and pulled the trigger. However, the pistol misfired, according to witnesses, and Kemp fled at top speed. Smith turned Bogan's pistol over to the town marshal.|$|E

25|$|The loyal dog, {{that could}} not wake up his owner but still kept trying to save his life, soaked himself in a nearby stream and {{extinguished}} the fire near Kim. The dog repeated this behavior until he saved Kim's life, but died of burns. Kim woke up after a while and {{found that there was}} a fire and that his dog was burnt to death near him, but that the grassland on and around which he slept was still wet, safe from the fire. Kim realized what his dog had done for him, cried bitterly, buried his dog in a nearby sunny place, and <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> walking staff in front of the grave instead of a tombstone. The story states that the wooden staff became a very large tree after several years, resulting {{in the name of the}} story (the Tree of a Dog). There still stands a huge tree in Osu-Myun to this day, aged about a thousand years.|$|E
500|$|His {{given name}} was Norman Alexander Dutton, but his birth names were quickly ignored. [...] A family {{friend of the}} Duttons refused to call him Norman as the name had a {{negative}} connotation for her, so she instead called him [...] "Mervyn", a name that <b>stuck.</b> <b>His</b> friends called him [...] "Red" [...] after the colour of his hair, and to most, {{he was known as}} Mervyn [...] "Red" [...] Dutton.|$|E
500|$|In July 1994, 29-year-old Australian tourist Kathryn Warburton {{jumped over}} two safety rails {{to get a}} {{close-up}} photograph of Binky in his cage. [...] When Binky <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> head through the bars and grabbed her, she suffered a broken leg and bite wounds. Another tourist caught the event on tape. [...] Binky kept the woman's shoe for three days {{before it could be}} retrieved by zoo officials, and the day after the attack Alaska Star photographer Rob Layman took a photo of Binky, holding the shoe in his mouth, that was printed in almost every press account of the incident. Warburton gave the other shoe to the Bird House, a bar in nearby Bird Creek that has since burned down.|$|E

500|$|On December 21, Patton {{met with}} Bradley {{to review the}} {{impending}} advance, starting the meeting by remarking, [...] "Brad, this time the Kraut's <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> head in the meat grinder, and I've got hold of the handle." [...] Patton then argued that his Third Army should attack toward Koblenz, cutting off the bulge at the base and trap {{the entirety of the}} German armies involved in the offensive. After briefly considering this, Bradley vetoed this proposal, as he was less concerned about killing large numbers of Germans than he was in arranging for the relief of Bastogne before it was overrun. Desiring good weather for his advance, which would permit close ground support by U.S. Army Air Forces tactical aircraft, Patton ordered the Third Army chaplain, Colonel James Hugh O'Neill, to compose a suitable prayer: ...|$|E
500|$|Everton manager David Moyes and Liverpool midfielder Steven Gerrard {{analysed}} {{the match}} on Sky Sports, and both agreed Ferdinand {{was fortunate to}} remain on the pitch. Although Moyes believed there was minimal contact between Rooney and Campbell in the lead-up to United's penalty award, he sympathised with the referee's decision as Campbell <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> leg out. He added: [...] "If the referee hadn't given the penalty he might have had to book Wayne. He chose to give the penalty." [...] Alan Hansen suggested Arsenal's defeat was a great result for their rivals, but felt they were strong favourites to win the league. He praised Ferguson for getting his tactics right, and lauded the performances of defenders Ferdinand and Campbell. On Match of the Day 2, Hansen was critical of Van Nistelrooy's tackle on Cole, calling it [...] "nasty and cynical." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I sneaked {{up there}} a few times. And under the bright, unforgiving lights of television, I was able to {{encounter}} the real Michelangelo. I {{was so close to}} him I could see the bristles from his brushes caught in the paint; and the mucky thumbprints he'd left along his margins. The first thing that impressed me was his speed. Michelangelo worked at Schumacher pace. Adam's famous little penis was captured with a single brushstroke: a flick of the wrist, and the first man had his manhood. I also enjoyed his sense of humour, which, from close up, turned out to be refreshingly puerile. If you look closely at the angels who attend the scary prophetess on the Sistine ceiling known as the Cumaean Sibyl, you will see that one of them has <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> thumb between his fingers in that mysteriously obscene gesture that visiting fans are still treated to today at Italian football matches." ...|$|E

500|$|Nixon speechwriter William Safire {{had been}} told of the sign by a friend of Nixon, Richard Moore, who left the train at {{campaign}} stops to mingle with the crowd and seek items of local color for the speechwriters to use. Safire stated in his book on {{the early days of}} the Nixon administration (originally published in 1975) that at Deshler, [...] "Moore boarded the train with that mystic look that a writer gets when he has something delicious to work with, some piece of color that could be more than a gimmick." [...] According to Safire in a 2007 column, Moore <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> head into the compartment occupied by Nixon's speechwriters and stated, [...] "There's a little kid out there with a hand-lettered sign that I think says 'Bring Us Together'." [...] Safire wrote in that column that he inserted the phrase into Nixon's remarks for the speech to be given at the next stop.|$|E
500|$|Patroclus' {{early life}} is obscure; nothing {{is known of}} his family apart from {{the name of his}} father, Patron. He {{certainly}} held various offices in the service of Ptolemy II, in which he must have distinguished himself for his ability and loyalty, particularly to Ptolemy's sister and second wife, Arsinoe II, before being appointed to the prestigious post of eponymous priest of the deified Alexander the Great and the Sibling Gods (Theoi Adelphoi, the deified Ptolemy II and Arsinoe) in 271/270 BC. His appointment to that office has been seen by some scholars as either a reward, or an incentive, for his execution of the poet Sotades, who in his compositions denounced the incestuous marriage between Ptolemy II and Arsinoe. Sotades was imprisoned in Alexandria, but managed to escape to the [...] "island of Kaunos", until Patroclus captured him, <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> feet in a leaden jar, and dropped him into the sea.|$|E
500|$|According to folk {{tradition}} Marko never died; he {{lives on in}} a cave, in a moss-covered den or in an unknown land. A Serbian legend recounts that Marko once fought a battle in which so many men were killed that the soldiers (and their horses) swam in blood. He lifted his hands towards heaven and said, [...] "Oh God, what am I going to do now?" [...] God took pity on Marko, transporting him and Šarac to a cave (where Marko <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> sabre into a rock and fell asleep). There is moss in the cave; Šarac eats it bit by bit, while the sabre slowly emerges from the rock. When it falls {{on the ground and}} Šarac finishes the moss, Marko will awaken and reenter the world. Some allegedly saw him after descending into a deep pit, where he lived in a large house in front of which Šarac was seen. Others saw him in a faraway land, living in a cave. According to Macedonian tradition Marko drank [...] "eagle's water", which made him immortal; he is with Elijah in heaven.|$|E

500|$|In the CFL's initial seasons, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats {{were the}} league's {{dominant}} team, appearing in nine Grey Cups and winning four titles between 1957 and 1967. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers opposed Hamilton on six of those occasions, winning four titles. The two teams {{were involved in}} a series of bizarre incidents, the first occurring during the 1957 Grey Cup. Toronto-based lawyer and fan David Humphrey had talked his way past stadium security and had been allowed to watch the game from the sidelines. Ten minutes into the fourth quarter, Hamilton's Ray Bawel intercepted a pass and it appeared he would return the ball for a touchdown when Humphrey <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> leg out and tripped Bawel as he ran up the sideline. Unsure how to handle the situation as there was no rule designed to cover it, referee Paul Dojack invented one on the spot. He placed the ball half the distance to the Winnipeg goal line from the point Bawel was tripped. The incident did not affect the final score, as Hamilton won 32–7. The league also created a new rule during the 1961 Grey Cup as it was the first in history to end regulation time in a tie: CFL Commissioner Sid Halter determined the teams would play an overtime period that consisted of two five-minute halves. [...] That rule remained the CFL standard into the 2000s. Winnipeg scored the lone touchdown in overtime to defeat Hamilton 21–14.|$|E
500|$|The session, {{held the}} evening of July 5, 1954, proved entirely unfruitful {{until late in the}} night. As they were about to give up and go home, Presley took his guitar and {{launched}} into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup's [...] "That's All Right". Moore recalled, [...] "All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them. Sam, I think, had the door to the control booth open... he <b>stuck</b> <b>his</b> head out and said, 'What are you doing?' And we said, 'We don't know.' 'Well, back up,' he said, 'try {{to find a place to}} start, and do it again.'" [...] Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for. Three days later, popular Memphis DJ Dewey Phillips played [...] "That's All Right" [...] on his WHBQ Red, Hot, and Blue show. Listeners began phoning in, eager to find out who the singer was. The interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the last two hours of his show. Interviewing Presley on-air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended in order to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed he was black. During the next few days, the trio recorded a bluegrass number, Bill Monroe's [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky", again in a distinctive style and employing an audio delay echo effect that Sam Phillips dubbed [...] "slapback". A single was pressed with [...] "That's All Right" [...] on the A side and [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky" [...] on the reverse.|$|E
