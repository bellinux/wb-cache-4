The {{tabernacle}} is situated on the chapel's altar. The church's main altar is faced with a dark green marble, and houses relics of Saints Andrew, Zenon of Verona, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, Cosmas, Damian and Anastasia, as well as the Virgin Mary's scarf and a donation from the Diocese of Verona. The ambo—a projection coming out from the soleas—is on the right side of the altar, and is faced with the same marble. Behind the altar, on the wall of the apse, there is a nine-metre high stone crucifix with a three-metre high figure of Christ. Plaster figures depicting the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist by architect Svyatoslav Sakhlebin are located on the left and the right sides (respectively) of the corbels. On the opposite side of the altar and above the cathedral's vestibule is the organ loft, which had originally room for 50choristers; a large part of it is now occupied by the organ.|$|E
500|$|The cathedral, {{built in}} a neo-Gothic style, is a three-aisled cross-shaped pseudo-basilica, which has three naves and an apse. It was {{constructed}} entirely from red brick, and was not rendered externally. The five-bay main aisle extends for , each with lateral arms [...] long. The octagonal lantern tower above the crossing is [...] high. The façade {{is based on the}} design of Westminster Abbey, and the tower loosely on that of Milan Cathedral. Typically for old-style church buildings, each <b>side</b> <b>aisle</b> is strengthened by five buttresses, the ten together symbolising the Ten Commandments. Crosses were erected, as part of the renovation, surmounting each principal tower; the central façade pinnacle and two other façade pinnacles feature the crests of John PaulII and archbishop Tadeusz Kondrusiewicz.|$|E
2500|$|The {{interior}} of the approximately oriented prayer hall is covered by cross vaults, on its northern side a pipe organ was installed on a loft. The tower, housing a staircase, flanks the northern <b>side</b> <b>aisle</b> and the westernmost bay of the main nave.|$|E
50|$|Within the walls, {{the body}} of the church is divided into a six bay nave and <b>side</b> <b>aisles.</b> The <b>side</b> <b>aisles</b> are formed by two heavy brick faced arcades. They {{comprise}} compound columns supporting six round arched openings. The compound columns are capped with white painted concrete capitals embellished with mouldings of foliage. The <b>side</b> <b>aisles</b> are further divided by round archways defining each of the bays of the nave and springing from the compound columns of the principal arcades.|$|R

The church is built {{from the south and}} west Surrey yellow ironstone-sandstone (Bargate stone) with 10 consecutive round windows, grouped in pairs, towards the simple string course eave. [...] Above immediately is guttering of equal height before the ascent of a long hipped slate roof surmounted by a simple yellow stone cross on the west end. [...] Its north lower, long vestry and <b>side</b> <b>aisle</b> with west-facing main door is between the height of the main building culminating in a transept matching the width of the square porch tower to which it joins and running equally to the south where it forms the vestry. A square belfry tower with flagpole surmount the chancel in lighter stone than all but the northern additions.|$|E

50|$|St. Marien is a three-aisled hall church {{without a}} transept. The main aisle is three bays long. The bays {{in the central}} nave are {{slightly}} rectangular. Both <b>side</b> <b>aisles</b> are four bays deep, these having a slight oblong shape. The central nave is separated from the <b>side</b> <b>aisles</b> by archways consisting of large compound piers. The extension of the <b>side</b> <b>aisles</b> by one bay each enables {{the inclusion of the}} western tower in the interior architecture. On the eastern side, the nearly-quadratic hall is appended by the polygon-shaped basilican chancel. Attached to the chancel on the north side is the quadratic sacristy, covering four bays. This has four arches, all buttressed by one central compound pier. The Gothic hall is overlaid by ribbed vaults. The nave is 20.56 metres long in total, which represents only a slight difference from the length and width measurements (roughly 25.5 and 24.5 metres respectively). This gives the nave an almost-cubical shape. The central nave is only slightly wider than the <b>side</b> <b>aisles.</b> This results in merely a weak accentuation of the longitudinal axis of the church. The bays of the <b>side</b> <b>aisles</b> counteract this slight longitudinal alignment by opening up their broadsides to the central nave, thus emphasising the lateral alignment. This gives the impression of undirected space. St. Marien is thus characterised by the overall appearance of its nave.|$|R

[35] Like Sir Gilbert Pickering, he was {{a member}} of the Northamptonshire {{committee}} of sequestration, and his deeds are thus commemorated in Walker's [...] "Sufferings of the Clergy:"--"Sir J---- D----n was never noted for ability or discretion; was a puritan by tenure, his house (Canons Ashby) being an ancient college, where he possessed the church, and abused most part of it to profane uses: the chancel he turned to a barn; the body of it to a corn-chamber and storehouse, reserving one <b>side</b> <b>aisle</b> of it for the public service of prayers, etc. He was noted for weakness and simplicity, and never put on any business of moment, but was very furious against the clergy." ...|$|E

Tingling and perspiring, Wetherell leaned out over the railing as the Speaker rapped calmly for order.
