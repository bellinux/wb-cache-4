5000|$|Other {{forms of}} Charter defence can lead {{not to the}} {{exclusion}} of evidence but to the termination <b>of</b> the <b>proceedings,</b> known as a <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings.</b> For example, if the accused is not brought to trial within a reasonable time, the proceedings must be stayed for delay by virtue of ss.11(b) and 24(1) <b>of</b> the Charter. <b>Stays</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> can also take place {{in the absence of a}} Charter violation. For example, the familiar [...] "defence" [...] of entrapment is neither a true defence nor necessarily a Charter breach. When entrapment is successfully established, the proceedings are deemed to be an [...] "abuse of process" [...] for which the remedy is a <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings.</b> Cases <b>of</b> abuse of process arise in certain other circumstances, and they can also can involve Charter breaches, and there is significant overlap.|$|R

50|$|Several U.S. {{statutes}} directly confer {{the right}} to interlocutory appeals, including appeals from orders denying arbitration, , and some judicial actions against the debtor upon filing bankruptcy proceedings, (a). There is a major split in the United States courts of appeals as to whether a <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> should issue in the district court while interlocutory appeals on the arbitrability of disputes are decided. Compare Bradford-Scott Data Corp., Inc. v. Physician Computer Network, 128 F.3d 504 (7th Cir. 1997), and Britton v. Co-op Banking Group, 916 F.2d 1405 (9th Cir. 1990). An interlocutory appeal under the collateral order doctrine usually merits a <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> while the appeal is being decided. Currently, the Second and Ninth Circuits have refused to stay proceedings in the district court while an arbitration issue is pending Motorola Credit Corp. v. Uzan, 388, F.3d 39, 53-4 (2d Cir. 2004; Britton v. Co-Op Banking Group, 916 F.2d 1405, 1412 (9th Cir. 1990). The Seventh, Tenth and Eleventh Circuit courts conversely hold that a non-frivolous appeal warrants a <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings.</b> See, Bradford-Scott Data Corp. v. Physician Computer Network, Inc., 128 F.3d, 504, 506 (7th Cir. 1997); Blinco v. Green Tree Servicing, LLC, 366 F.3d 1249, 1251-2 (11th Cir. 2004); McCauley et al. v.
