60|$|And he {{told her}} of a whole world, or rather of several intermingled worlds, set apart in this sleepy hollow in the hills, of beast lore and wood lore and farm craft, at times {{touching}} almost the border of witchcraft--passing lightly here, not with the probing eagerness of those who know nothing, but with the averted glance of those who fear to see too much. He told her {{of those things that}} slept and those that prowled when the dusk fell, of strange hunting cats, of the yard swine and the <b>stalled</b> <b>cattle,</b> of the farm folk themselves, as curious and remote in their way, in their ideas and fears and wants and tragedies, as the brutes and feathered stock that they tended. It seemed to Elaine as if a musty store of old-world children's books had been fetched down from some cobwebbed lumber- room and brought to life. Sitting there in the little paddock, grown thickly with tall weeds and rank grasses, and shadowed by the weather-beaten old grey barn, listening to this chronicle of wonderful things, half fanciful, half very real, she could scarcely believe that a few miles away there was a garden-party in full swing, with smart frocks and smart conversation, fashionable refreshments and fashionable music, and a fevered undercurrent of social strivings and snubbings. Did Vienna and the Balkan Mountains and the Black Sea seem as remote and hard to believe in, she wondered, to the man sitting by her side, who had discovered or invented this wonderful fairyland? Was it a true and merciful arrangement of fate and life that the things of the moment thrust out the after-taste of the things that had been? Here was one who had held much that was priceless in the hollow of his hand and lost it all, and he was happy and absorbed and well-content with the little wayside corner of the world into which he had crept. And Elaine, who held so many desirable things in the hollow of her hand, could not make up her mind to be even moderately happy. She did not even know whether to take this hero of her childhood down from his pedestal, or to place him on a higher one; on the whole she was inclined to resent rather than approve the idea that ill- health and misfortune could so completely subdue and tame an erstwhile bold and roving spirit.|$|E

50|$|There are {{religious}} and social festivals celebrated {{by the people}} of Balochistan. Two major religious festivals are Eid-ul-Azha and Eid-ul-Fiter. On these festivals people adorn their houses, wear new dresses, cook special dishes and visit each other. Eid-Meladun-Nabi is another religious festival. It is a celebration of the Holy Prophet’s birthday. Numerous colorful social festivals are also source of jubilation. Sibi festival that traces its roots to Mehergar, an archeological site of ancient human civilization, attracts people from across the country. It is attended by common folks, ministers and other government officials. Folk music performance, cultural dances, handicrafts <b>stalls,</b> <b>cattle</b> shows {{and a number of other}} amusing activities present a perfect riot of color.

50|$|By 1951, {{through the}} {{incorporation}} of former Army buildings, the showground facilities had expanded to include three exhibition halls, a grandstand, extended agricultural and pastoral <b>stalls</b> for <b>cattle</b> and horses, dairy stalls and milking shed, as well as poultry and dog enclosures, a caretaker's office, association offices, a Pacific Ice cream booth, re-positioned entrance and side gates, as well as ticket offices and the Curly Bell stand. During this period the North Queensland pastoral industry renewed its breeding effort to produce a breed of cattle resilient to northern climatic conditions. As a result, the Townsville Show hosted the Brahman cattle breed {{for the first time}} in 1952 and the Santa Gertrudis in 1953. Both breeds were received by an enthusiastic crowd.|$|R
5000|$|Sometime in the 15th century, an iron age farming {{community}} with a large continuous village area on the footslopes of the Rift Valley escarpment, housing several thousand people developed an intricate irrigation and cultivation system, involving a stone-block canal channelling water from the [...] "Crater Highlands" [...] rift escarpment to stonelined cultivation terraces (Stump, Daryl 2006, Laulumaa, Vesa 2006). Measures were taken to prevent soil erosion and the fertility of the plots was increased by using the manure of <b>stall</b> fed <b>cattle.</b> For an unknown reason Engaruka was abandoned at latest in the mid-18th century.

60|$|It {{was a long}} barn indeed. Rollo {{thought he}} had never seen so large a building.

They walked down the barn floor, and in one place Rollo passed a large bull chained by the nose in one of the stalls. The bull uttered a sort of low growl or roar, as Rollo and his father passed, which made him a little afraid; but his attention was soon attracted to some hens, a little farther along, which were standing {{on the edge of the}} scaffolding over his head, and cackling with noise enough to fill the whole barn.|$|R

50|$|The {{plan of the}} Abbey of Saint Gall (719 AD) {{indicates}} the general arrangement of a Benedictine monastery of its day. According to the architect Robert Willis (architect) (1800-1875) the Abbey's lay out {{is that of a}} town of individual houses with streets running between them. The abbey was planned in compliance with the Benedictine rule that, if possible, a monastery should be self-contained. For instance, there was a mill, a bakehouse, stables, and <b>cattle</b> <b>stalls.</b> In all, there were thirty-three separate structures; mostly one level wooden buildings.|$|R
50|$|Extensive cattle yards are {{contained}} in 8 sections which include over 100 <b>cattle</b> <b>stall</b> partitions.

50|$|At this {{transitional}} stage, the baserri buildings {{consisted of}} timbered structures that are barely reminiscent of dwellings, made up often in oak {{from the surrounding}} forests. In fact, the central position {{in the house was}} occupied by the press, since cider was a very important economic activity for the family's economy. Then, families started to move in for the initially cider producing mill, <b>cattle</b> <b>stall</b> and granary, eventually complementing or even replacing its original function with the dwelling. A well-known example of this type of baserri is the Igartubeiti baserri (built 1530), now an interactive museum and exhibition space, hosting events related to cider making (e.g. txalaparta) and traditional rural live.|$|R
50|$|A {{good example}} of a long house is Cilewent Farmhouse from Llansanffraid Cwmteuddwr, nr Rhayader, Radnorshire which has been reconstructed at St Fagans. This is a long-house, with cattle being {{accommodated}} {{at one end and}} humans at the other, with a passageway between the two parts. This type of farmhouse was once common in mid- and south Wales. This cruck and timber-framed house was originally built about 1470 as an open hall house. The original timber walls were rebuilt in stone in 1734, with the date being carved on the head of the entrance door frame. All that remains of the original house are the two cruck trusses in the cow house and the timber-framed partition between the cow house and the dwelling. Another re-construction at St Fagans is Hendre'r-ywydd Uchaf Farmhouse from Llangynhafal in Denbighshire. This a cruck-framed hall-house dendrochronologically dated to 1508 and typical of the better class of Welsh farmhouse in the late Middle Ages. The building is divided into five bays, the lower two used for housing for cattle and horses, the centre bay serving as a work-room and the upper two comprising the open hall and a bedroom. The outside walls are timber-framed, the panels being in-filled with wattle and daubed with clay. Both the daubed panels and the timber work are limewashed as was common in the Middle Ages. The open hearth is placed in the centre of the hall, smoke from the fire escaping through the roof and the unglazed windows. Excavations in 2003 by Bill Britnell at Tŷ Draw at Llanarmon Mynydd Mawr in north Powys have done much to elucidate the relationship of the cow house with the hall of a longhouse. This is a classic three unit hall house of longhouse type. It has an open hall of two bays set between inner and outer rooms, the outer room acting as an cow byre. Dendrochrononology on the roof purlins suggest that Tŷ Draw was completed shortly after 1479/80 and it has been possible to suggest from this dating that the house was built by Hywel ap Rees. In the byre area, which was accessed by door, a series of small post holes were noted, that have been interpreted as wickerwork hurdles. These would have provided <b>stalls</b> for <b>cattle</b> which were overwintered from November to March each year. Similar evidence for <b>stalls</b> for <b>cattle</b> have been found at Tŷ Mawr and Tyddyn Llwydion in Montgomeryshire.|$|R

One of Marshall's men then fires on the truck, spraying the detainees with bullets. [...] "See, now they won't suffocate to death", he says. When the soldier threatens {{to report the}} incident, he is promptly shot. In Abu Ghraib, a group of American soldiers, among them the sole female Westerner in the film (a clear reference to Lynndie England and the Abu Ghraib torture scandal), is making naked human pyramids from those arrested in the wedding, aided by an Arab interpreter.

50|$|Batak Toba culture centres on Lake Toba and {{the sacred}} island of Samosir that lies within it. Jabu is the Toba {{language}} word for rumah adat. The houses {{are made up}} of three sections. A substructure of large wooden pillars resting on flat stones (or concrete nowadays) protects the structure from rising damp. Some of these pillars support longitudinal beams known as labe-labe, which run the length of the house at head height to carry the massive roof. Other pillars carry two large beams with carved singa heads which, with two lateral beams mortised into them, form a great ring beam bearing the small living area. The substructure is strengthened by beams mortised into the piles which double as night <b>stalls</b> for <b>cattle.</b> Walls are lightweight and lean outwards and provide additional stability to the structure. The wall and the wall plate supporting the rafters hang from the labe-labe with rattan cord, while the base of the wall sits on the ring beam. The rafters spring from the wall plate and are angled outwards producing the roof curve. In lieu of horizontal bracing battens, diagonal ties - running {{from the middle of the}} labe-labe to the gable ends - provide reinforcement.|$|R
50|$|A {{central drive}} runs {{from north to}} south, {{connecting}} the two lower level doors. On either side are pens for horses and cows, with four horse stalls on either side {{at the north end}} and six <b>cattle</b> <b>stalls</b> on either side at the south end. There is a small walkway between the horse and <b>cattle</b> <b>stalls</b> and another walkway next to the outside walls {{at the south end of}} the barn. Behind the stalls on both the east- and west sides are smaller open areas with feed alleys that served as low pens for sheep and calves. Additionally, there is a set of stairs to the upper level in the northeast corner of the barn and a bull stall in the northwest corner. The upper level consists of a large haymow for the storage of hay and straw and the roof's system is readily visible. Windows help to provide light to the upper level where laminated beams serve as the main means of support between the two different roof sections. Additionally, another laminated beam is placed near the roof's apex to offer support for the metal aerator that successfully ventilates the upper reaches of the barn. The only door on the upper level is the one on the east that is serviced by the ramp and the stairs to the lower level are located in the northeast quadrant.The ground level is composed of many pens on either side of a main walkway running north to south. There is a shorter walkway that connects this main walk to the twelve-sided barn, with the smaller walk running east-west. The upper floors are open for the storage of hay and straw. The northern barn, being one story, has only attic space above the lower level.|$|R

25|$|Originally the Low German house {{took its}} {{simplest}} and basic form, the Zweiständerhaus or two-post farmhouse. This had {{two rows of}} uprights on which the ceiling joists rested. The two rows of posts {{ran the length of}} the building and created the great central threshing floor or Diele characteristic of this type of farmhouse. On the outside of the rows of uprights, underneath the eaves, low side rooms or bays known as Kübbungen were often built with non load-bearing external walls. These Kübbungen acted as stables or <b>stalls</b> for the <b>cattle</b> and gave this type of house its alternative name of Kübbungshaus. A classic feature of the Zweiständerhaus is that the loft is not supported by the outside walls but only by the two rows of uprights that form part of the hall sides or walls.|$|R

Along the wall, larger and more comfortable blue-painted pew boxes with wooden floors, often also serving as barn <b>cattle</b> <b>stalls,</b> would have served wealthier families who would sometimes bring straw, blankets, hot bricks, or dogs to keep them warm. To reflect the simplicity of such meeting places, the ceiling beams are made of poplar and flooring suggests a typical capel dirt floor.

5000|$|Within the Northern Bronze Age context, many {{important}} reasons are mentioned to {{the custom of}} storing cattle inside a building and, moreover, inside the proper house. This could point to a new emphasis on milk production and making cheese, especially since drinking milk {{was made possible by}} a gene against lactose intolerance, first to emerge amongst neolithic Northern European populations. <b>Cattle</b> <b>stalling</b> was necessary to avoid cows giving less milk in cold conditions (Sherratt, 1983; Zimermann, 1999, 314; Olausson 1999, 321). Social exchange and a role in the supernatural would have been important as well (Fokkens 1999), supported by, for instance, stacks of cowhides in graves and the offerings of animals attested in both Sweden and Denmark (Rasmussen 1999: 287). Protection against cattle raids would fit the circumstances—proven by grave goods, rock engravings and hoards—of a strong martial ideology in this era (Fokkens 1999).|$|R
50|$|Historically {{there were}} three main types of German farmhouses, many of which survive today. The Low German house or Niedersachsenhaus (Lower Saxony house) is found mainly on the North German Plain, but also in {{large parts of the}} Netherlands.

The large barn door at the gable end opens into a spacious hall, or Deele, with <b>cattle</b> <b>stalls</b> and barns on either side and living accommodation at the end. The Middle German house may also be a single unit, but access is from the side, and the roof is supported by the outside walls. Later this type of mitteldeutsches Haus was expanded to two or more buildings around a rectangular farmyard, often with a second story. The South German house is found in southern Germany and has two main variants, the Swabian or Black Forest house and the Bavarian farmstead.|$|R

It was excavated again between 1953 and 1957 by J. R. C. Hamilton, who proposed a complex chronology for it. The earliest occupation of the site, according to Hamilton, was a small Late Bronze Age farmstead of the 7th or 6th centuries BC which (he said) was superseded by a larger circular Iron Age farmhouse built about the 5th century BC. In the 4th, or early 3rd century BC, Hamilton continued, a stone-walled fort consisting of the block-house and ringwork was constructed, which was in turn superseded by the broch in about the 1st century AD. In the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD a large wheelhouse was built within the reduced tower and with minor outhouses, storage pits and <b>cattle</b> <b>stalls</b> dug in the debris inside the older defences.|$|R

50|$|The typical Gulf house {{consisted}} of a living space (fööeräen) and an adjoining working area (achteräen) with stable and barn. By extending the roof downwards in the rear part of the house, side bays (Abseiten) were created, the so-called ūtkübben, so that the barn area became wider than the living area. The centre of the stable and barn section formed the Gulf, a storage area for hay, harvest products and tools, which gave this type of house its name.In {{one of the side}} bays were compartments or <b>stalls</b> for keeping <b>cattle</b> (kaustâl). The walkway running in front of them was called the kaugâng ("cow passage"). At the far end there was traditionally the privy (gemak).At the gable end of the working area were two doors: a large barn door (sğüerdööer) on one side, that gave access for wagons to the threshing floor (dösdêl) and the Gulf, and a small, double door (messeldööer) on the other side. The latter derived its name because it was the door through which cattle dung was carried from the kaugâng (dung = mäers; remove dung = messen).|$|R
