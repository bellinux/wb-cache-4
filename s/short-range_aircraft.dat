25|$|The Luftwaffe did {{end up with}} an {{air force}} {{consisting}} mainly of relatively <b>short-range</b> <b>aircraft,</b> {{but this does not}} prove that the German air force was solely interested in ’tactical’ bombing. It happened because the German aircraft industry lacked the experience to build a long-range bomber fleet quickly, and because Hitler was insistent on the very rapid creation of a numerically large force. It is also significant that Germany's position in the centre of Europe to a large extent obviated the need to make a clear distinction between bombers suitable only for ’tactical’ and those necessary for strategic purposes {{in the early stages of}} a likely future war.|$|E
2500|$|Hei-type {{landing craft}} {{carriers}} included a flight deck with {{a capacity for}} 28 aircraft, but no hangar deck, since the deck beneath the flight deck was used to carry 25 landing craft launched through stern doors. Akisu Maru was completed in time {{to participate in the}} invasion of Java; but she and the other Hei-types were thereafter used primarily as ferries to transport <b>short-range</b> <b>aircraft</b> to distant bases. The first two were completed from 11,800-ton, [...] Nippon Kaiun, K. K. passenger ships under construction by Harima Shipbuilding. They operated two Kayaba Ka-1 autogyros. Both were sunk by submarines in 1944.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{airports}} {{existed in}} Newfoundland, and Britain built an airfield in Reykjavik, Iceland (1940), the only {{practical way to}} get <b>short-range</b> <b>aircraft</b> to Europe was by cargo ship.|$|E

25|$|The Hs 123 was not {{employed}} in the subsequent Battle of Britain as the English Channel proved a formidable obstacle for the <b>short-ranged</b> <b>aircraft.</b> The sole operator, II.(Schl)/LG 2 went back to Germany to re-equip with the Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighter bomber (Jabo) variant. The Bf 109E fighter bomber was not capable of carrying any more bombs than the Hs 123. It did, however, have a greater range and was far more capable of defending itself. On the downside were the notoriously tricky taxiing, ground handling and takeoff/landing characteristics, especially exacerbated with a bomb load.|$|R
50|$|Project Cedar (also {{known as}} Operation Cedar) was a World War II project to deliver <b>short-range</b> <b>aircraft</b> from the United States to the USSR via Abadan, Iran in the Persian Gulf.|$|E
50|$|The medium- and {{long-range}} passenger- {{and cargo}} aircraft of Aeroflot were {{also part of}} the strategic air transport reserve, ready to provide immediate airlift support to the armed forces. <b>Short-range</b> <b>aircraft</b> and helicopters were available for appropriate military support missions.|$|E
50|$|Another {{widespread}} type of airstair is {{used for}} forward doors. The stair folds and stows under {{the floor of the}} door and is deployed from the fuselage immediately below the forward door. This type of airstair is found on many <b>short-range</b> <b>aircraft</b> such as Boeing 737s, DC-9s, and some Airbus A320 series aircraft. The mechanism is also quite heavy; as a result, many airlines have removed this system to reduce aircraft weight.|$|E
5000|$|The {{versatility}} of {{the carrier}} was demonstrated in November 1940 when [...] launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at Taranto signalling {{the beginning of}} the effective mobile <b>aircraft</b> strikes, by <b>short-ranged</b> <b>aircraft.</b> This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships in the harbour at a cost of two of the 21 attacking Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers. Carriers also played a major part in reinforcing Malta, both by transporting planes and by defending convoys sent to supply the besieged island. The use of carriers prevented the Italian Navy and land-based German aircraft from dominating the Mediterranean theatre.|$|R
50|$|External drop tanks {{turned the}} Republic P-47 Thunderbolt from a <b>short-range</b> {{interceptor}} <b>aircraft</b> into a long-range escort and air superiority fighter, enabling it to accompany bombers from British Isles into Germany, {{and made it}} possible for heavy bomber formations to undertake daylight raids under escort by North American P-51 Mustangs.|$|R
25|$|The Aichi F1A (designated AB-13 by its {{designers}} and manufacturers at Aichi) was a prototype Japanese floatplane of the 1930s. A single-engined biplane, the F1A {{was intended as}} a <b>short-range</b> observation <b>aircraft</b> suitable for operation off the Imperial Japanese navy's warships, but only two were built, the Mitsubishi F1M being selected instead.|$|R
5000|$|On 20 June 2011, SAS {{announced}} {{an order for}} 30 new A320neo aircraft {{as part of its}} fleet harmonisation plan. SAS had earlier announced that the fleet will be harmonized. Its <b>short-range</b> <b>aircraft</b> consists of two types from 2016: Airbus A320 family at the bases in Copenhagen and Stockholm and Boeing 737NG at the bases in Oslo and in Stockholm [...]There were six leased A320s in the SAS fleet at the beginning of May 2013.|$|E
5000|$|No. 269 Squadron {{completed}} its deployment to RAF Lagens in the Azores with its Hudson Mk IIIA, Martinet, Walrus and Spitfire Mk V aircraft. The <b>short-range</b> <b>aircraft</b> were launched off the escort aircraft carrier [...] Later in October, some Warwick aircraft {{were added to}} the squadron. For the rest of the war it flew air-sea rescue missions, as well as meteorlogical and target towing sorties. Following the end of World War II, No. 269 Squadron was disbanded on 10 March 1946.|$|E
50|$|TWA's fleet-renewal program {{included}} adding newer and smaller, more fuel-efficient, longer-range aircraft {{such as the}} Boeing 757 and 767 and <b>short-range</b> <b>aircraft</b> such as the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 and Boeing 717. Aircraft such as the Boeing 727 and 747, {{along with}} the Lockheed L-1011 and older DC-9s, some from Ozark and the 1960s, were retired. TWA also {{became one of the}} early customers for the Airbus A318 through International Lease Finance Corporation. TWA, had it continued operating through 2003, would have been the first U.S. carrier to fly the type.|$|E
25|$|In 1930, Mitsubishi {{developed}} two {{designs to}} meet a Japanese Army requirement for a <b>short-range</b> reconnaissance <b>aircraft</b> to supplement the larger, long-range Kawasaki Type 88, the 2MR7, a biplane based on its earlier 2MR reconnaissance aircraft and B2M torpedo bomber developed for the Imperial Japanese Navy, and the 2MR8, a high-wing parasol monoplane.|$|R

50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the British, German and Italian main defence {{companies}} looked at developing a strike aircraft together. The West Germans and Italians wanted a more <b>short-range</b> battlefield <b>aircraft</b> (something like the current A-10), but the British, specifically Air Chief Marshal Derek Hodgkinson, {{argued for a}} more long range aircraft. Negotiations took place in London, Bonn and Munich.|$|R

50|$|During World War II, {{military}} aircraft fuel tanks were constructed out of plastic impregnated paper, {{and used to}} extend the range of aircraft. These tanks were plumbed to the regular fuel system via detachable fittings and dropped from the aircraft when the fuel was expended, allowing <b>short-range</b> <b>aircraft</b> such as fighters to accompany long-range aircraft such as bombers on longer missions as protection forces. Two types of paper tanks were used, a 200-gallon (758 l) conformal fuel tank made by the US for the P-47 Thunderbolt, and a 108-gallon (409 l) cylindrical drop tank made by the British and used by the P-47 and the P-51 Mustang.|$|E

5000|$|The {{unit had}} almost no {{opportunity}} for training because each of its squadrons was busily engaged in carrying out mapping missions for hemisphere defense. The Photographic Squadrons were largely equipped with <b>short-range</b> second-line <b>aircraft</b> from the 1930s.

5000|$|RAF Coastal Command, when it {{was created}} in 1936, was given {{responsibility}} for A/S (or ASW) patrol. It was equipped only with small numbers of <b>short-ranged</b> <b>aircraft,</b> the most common being the Avro Anson (which was obsolescent {{by the start of}} World War II) and Vickers Vildebeest (which was obsolete); for a time, shortages of aircraft were so severe, [...] "scarecrow patrols" [...] using Tiger Moths were even employed. Bomber Command routinely got higher priority for the best, longest-ranged aircraft. Only as Bomber Command transitioned to four-engined aircraft did Coastal Command receive the castoffs, such as Vickers Wellingtons, which finally had adequate range for A/S patrol. Moreover, Coastal Command's motley assortment of Ansons, Whitleys, and Hampdens were unable to carry the standard 450 lb (205 kg) depth charge; that needed Wellingtons or Sunderlands. (The other aircraft capable of carrying it, the Avro Lancaster, was Bomber Command's crown jewel.) ...|$|R
50|$|The Let L-410 Turbolet is a {{twin-engine}} <b>short-range</b> transport <b>aircraft,</b> {{manufactured by}} the Czech aircraft manufacturer LET, {{often used as}} an airliner. The aircraft is capable of landing on short and unpaved runways and operating under extreme conditions from +50 °C to -50 °C. In 2016, 1,200 L-410 have been built and over 350 are in service in more than 50 countries.|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 198 Me 323s were built before {{production}} ceased in April 1944. There were several production versions, {{beginning with the}} D-1. Later D- and E- versions differed {{in the choice of}} power plant and in defensive armament, with improvements in structural strength, total cargo load and fuel capacity also being implemented. Nonetheless, the Me 323 remained significantly underpowered. There was a proposal to install six BMW 801 radials, but this never came to pass. The Me 323 was also a <b>short-range</b> <b>aircraft,</b> with a typical range (loaded) of 1,000-1,200 km (620-750 mi). Despite this, the limited numbers of Me 323s in service were an invaluable asset to the Germans, and saw intensive use.|$|E
50|$|Finally, the {{industrial}} centers arrayed against the Axis - in the United States and the Urals and Siberia - were {{simply out of}} reach of strategic reconnaissance. As always it was at the tactical level that the Germans excelled, and <b>short-range</b> <b>aircraft</b> were able to hold their own in the East until fuel, pilots, and even aircraft became depleted. Experts generally hold that the top German leadership failed to understand air power, and Hitler has been especially blamed for lacking the strategic perspective that the West Allies adopted. But since {{the industrial}} mismatch was insurmountable, it is doubtful what difference a greater German emphasis on strategic reconnaissance and commensurate bombardment would have made.|$|E
5000|$|The Bristol Type 200 was a {{proposal}} for a <b>short-range</b> <b>aircraft</b> by the Bristol Aeroplane Company in 1956. Although it was designed in response to a specification issued by British European Airways (BEA), the Type 200 was larger than the airline's requirements and was closer to the Boeing 727 in size and range. The project was cancelled when BEA selected the Hawker Siddeley Trident instead. The Trident went on to have a production run of 117, while the 727 had a production run of over 1800. Along with the Vickers V-1000, it is seen by some {{as one of the great}} [...] "what ifs" [...] of British aviation, although it never got beyond the drawing board.|$|E
50|$|In 1930, Mitsubishi {{developed}} two {{aircraft to}} meet an Imperial Japanese Army Air Force requirement for a <b>short-range</b> reconnaissance <b>aircraft,</b> the 2MR7, a biplane developed from the 2MR and the B2M torpedo bomber and the 2MR8 parasol monoplane, with the 2MR8 being successful and ordered into service as the Type 92 Reconnaissance Aircraft. This aircraft was unrelated to the Navy 2MR aircraft.|$|R
2500|$|The Mitsubishi Type 92 Reconnaissance Aircraft (九二式偵察機) (company {{designation}} 2MR8) was a Japanese <b>short-range</b> reconnaissance <b>aircraft</b> of the 1930s {{designed by}} Mitsubishi [...] for the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force. A total of 230 were built, serving [...] between 1933 and 1936. A parasol monoplane, the Type 92 {{was the first}} military aircraft powered by an engine both designed and manufactured in Japan to enter service.|$|R
25|$|From 1983 to 1986, some Hawks were {{equipped}} as <b>short-range</b> interceptor <b>aircraft.</b> 88 T1s were {{modified to}} carry two AIM-9L Sidewinder air-to-air missiles {{in addition to}} a 30mm ADEN cannon gun pod; these aircraft were redesignated as Hawk T1A. In a wartime scenario, they would have worked in collaboration with the RAF's Tornado F3 interceptors, which would use their Foxhunter search radars and more sophisticated navigation systems to vector the Hawks against enemy targets.|$|R
50|$|On December 19, 1957, in {{accordance}} with a decree of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, the construction of Kurumoch Airport commenced. Construction was overseen and managed by N.P. Skrinsky, {{the chairman of the}} Kuybyshev airport from January 7, 1958, to December 14, 1959. The airport was at first named Kurumoch Airport, but was later renamed Kuybyshev Airport because Samara's official name from 1935 to 1991 was Kuybyshev. The airport did not have a domestic or international passenger status, because the initial purpose of the airport was for military practices and cargo imports/exports.On July 30, 1960, Kuybyshev Airport became operational for military purposes. On that same day, the first avionic practice was held with 13 Ilyushin Il-18s and seven Antonov An-10s. Kuybyshev Airport was also used as a transit aerodrome for <b>short-range</b> <b>aircraft</b> in need of refuelling.|$|E

50|$|The D.H.86 was conceptually a four-engined {{enlargement}} of the successful de Havilland Dragon, but of more streamlined appearance with tapered wings and extensive use of metal fairings around struts and undercarriage. The most powerful engine made by de Havilland, the new 200 hp (149 kW) Gipsy Six, was selected. For long-range work the aircraft was to carry a single pilot in the streamlined nose, with a wireless operator behind. Maximum seating for ten passengers was provided in the long-range type, however the <b>short-range</b> Holyman <b>aircraft</b> were fitted with twelve seats.|$|R
