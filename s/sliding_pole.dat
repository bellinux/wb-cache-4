50|$|A fireman's pole (also {{called a}} <b>sliding</b> <b>pole,</b> firepole, or tom) is a wooden pole or a metal tube or pipe {{installed}} between floors in fire stations, allowing firefighters responding to an alarm to quickly descend {{to the ground}} floor faster than by using a standard staircase.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} {{there are}} cabin wings, which extend between {{old and new}} entrances {{in the style of}} the 1930s. Several playgrounds are available, such as [...] "Gacetto", spider, <b>sliding</b> <b>pole,</b> table tennis and 2 match-fair Beach volleyball places. At the end of August the Saxonia championships are held here.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{the strong}} {{tradition}} and time advantage of <b>slide</b> <b>poles,</b> the National Fire Protection Association {{has called for}} the removal of all poles from US fire stations due to safety hazards. Many cities have removed poles from their stations, but some new multilevel fire stations include <b>slide</b> <b>poles</b> with appropriate safety features.|$|R
50|$|On {{the inside}} much {{original}} trim remains. The apparatus room has narrow wainscoting, {{part of which}} is now concealed by a dropped ceiling. Semicircular openings in the walls house the <b>sliding</b> <b>poles.</b> In the rear a row of large doors once served as the stables, with another set on the south opening into the former harness room.|$|R
50|$|<b>Slide</b> <b>poles</b> {{can be made}} safer. Cushions can {{be placed}} {{around the base of}} the pole to soften landings. Other safety {{features}} include railings, baskets or closets that surround part of the opening, weight-activated doors that open only when weight is applied to the pole to prevent accidental falls, and exhaust control systems that prevent fumes from the apparatus bay from coming into the living quarters.|$|R
50|$|The fire {{department}} in Hamilton {{dates back to}} 1879, when Alexander Aitchison was appointed Fire Chief of the city. Aitchison was responsible for radically reforming the department, and during his tenure, the department was changed into an entirely paid one, as well as introducing the first swinging harness and <b>sliding</b> <b>pole</b> in Canada.|$|E
50|$|Inside, {{the front}} of the {{building}} originally housed the fire fighting apparatus while the rear housed the horses. Personnel stayed on the second floor and could access the first floor via a brass <b>sliding</b> <b>pole.</b> A steep staircase, intended to keep horses from following firemen up to their quarters, also led to the second floor. Hay was stored on the third floor loft. The captain had a room of his own with a desk.|$|E
50|$|On playgrounds, several swings {{are often}} {{suspended}} from the same metal or wooden frame, known as a swing set, allowing more than one child to play at a time. Such swings {{come in a variety}} of sizes and shapes. For infants and toddlers, swings with leg holes support the child in an upright position while a parent or sibling pushes the child to get a swinging motion. Some swing sets include play items other than swings, such as a rope ladder or <b>sliding</b> <b>pole.</b>|$|E
50|$|Seconds {{before the}} final chorus, Tiffani, Sophie, Katie and Belinda <b>slide</b> down <b>poles</b> into Sally's set and spend the final chorus singing together.|$|R
5000|$|The rooms {{consist of}} {{platforms}} on various levels, connected by ladders and <b>sliding</b> <b>poles.</b> Doors lead from one room to another. Some doors are locked, and the player {{must find a}} key {{to be able to}} go through them. Most doors are not locked but may be opened by a doorbell. However, in some cases, the doorbell is only on one [...] "side" [...] of the door (i.e. in one connecting room but not the other), and sometimes the doorbell is difficult to reach.|$|R

5000|$|The former Engine Company 6 {{station is}} located in Hartford's southeastern Sheldon-Charter Oak neighborhood, {{on the east side}} of Huyshope Street at its {{junction}} with Nepaquash Street. It is a two story Moderne style brick and brownstone structure, with a foundation of brownstone and concrete, and a flat roof. It is three bays wide, with two equipment bays on the right. The left bay has a pedestrian entrance and windows, set in a slightly smaller opening. The second floor bays have bands of three sash windows. The interior retains some original fixtures and finishes, but the <b>sliding</b> <b>pole</b> has been removed. [...] The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 2, 1989.|$|E
50|$|Movement is {{achieved}} by jumping, running, <b>sliding</b> down <b>poles,</b> and climbing chains and ladders. Enemies are skulls, snakes, and spiders. A further complication arises in the bottom-most floors of each pyramid, which must be played in total darkness unless a torch is found.|$|R
50|$|His {{early life}} on the {{outskirts}} of Phnom Penh during the Khmer Rouge were plagued by tragedy and horror. His father disappeared in the early 1970s and was believed to have been killed. In starving conditions his aunt and uncle both died of disease. Tan was assigned different jobs at different times: planting rice, clearing forests, digging canals, building dikes. On one occasion he was among a group of people assigned to move a house to a new work site. Rather than disassemble the simple bamboo-and-thatch structure so that it could be loaded onto a truck or oxcarts, the cadre ordered the workers to <b>slide</b> <b>poles</b> below the floor, then lift the entire building and carry it to its new location almost 30 miles away.|$|R
50|$|The Engine Company 15 Fire Station {{is located}} in southwestern Hartford, at {{junction}} of Fairfield and New Britain Avenues. It is a two story brick building with Colonial Revival features. It is roughly rectangular in shape, three bays wide, with the leftmost pedestrian entrance bay recessed. The right two bays house equipment, and have rectangular garage door openings. Windows {{on the second floor}} are in groups of three, with splayed lintels that have stone keystones. Stone stringcourses run {{at the top of the}} first-floor windows and at the bottom of the second-floor windows. A stone panel above the equipment bays is carved with the company identification. The upstairs rooms feature original woodwork, including door and window trim. Wooden doors conceal the <b>slide</b> <b>pole,</b> and the rear of the story contains exposed elements of what originally served as a hay loft. Behind the equipment bays on the ground floor is a kitchen space that is built into what were originally horse stalls. The basement includes an area formerly used for hose drying.|$|R
50|$|Two Tetherball {{games were}} {{introduced}} {{but as of}} mid-2006, the ropes broke but were soon repaired by student Brayden Postma. Two Four Square games were also made and are used every recess. The baseball field is used rarely during recess. Twin soccer fields are used almost daily. There are 4 sand pits for track and field and two basketball courts. The playground consists of 2 <b>slides,</b> fire <b>pole,</b> monkey bars, and tic tac toe game.|$|R
50|$|At {{a nearby}} fire department, the alarm rings. The lead fireman, who {{is none other}} than Kiko the Kangaroo, leaps out of bed, and <b>slides</b> down the <b>pole.</b> He then heads his fellow firefighters toward the blazing building.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not so," [...] responded his dragoman. [...] "We {{climb to}} the top of the <b>pole,</b> <b>slide</b> imperceptibly down, and begin over again; but since we never really know whether we are {{climbing}} or sliding, this does not depress us." ...|$|R
60|$|For {{the first}} time in his life Seth enjoyed the {{pleasure}} of <b>sliding</b> down the <b>pole</b> to the floor below, and this method of descending served to strengthen certain portions of the air-castles he had built just before falling asleep.|$|R
5000|$|Tinikling is a {{traditional}} Philippine folk dance which originated during the Spanish colonial era. The dance involves two people beating, tapping, and <b>sliding</b> bamboo <b>poles</b> {{on the ground and}} against each other in coordination with one or more dancers who step over and in between the poles in a dance. It is traditionally danced to rondalla music, a sort of serenade played by an ensemble of stringed instruments which originated in Spain during the Middle Ages.|$|R

500|$|The {{building}} was an unusually narrow structure, only [...] wide but [...] deep stretching the entire distance from Fifth to Winston Streets. [...] The main floor was an arcade connecting Fifth and Winston Streets with stalls for ten horses, repressed vitrified brick, walls of white enamel tiling, and pressed steel ceilings [...] above the floor. [...] More than anything else, {{it was the}} extravagant third floor living quarters, described as [...] "the chief's boudoir" [...] and a [...] "palace for chiefs," [...] that drew the most attention. [...] Access {{to the third floor}} was by a private elevator that [...] "moves noiselessly and stealthily to the upper haven." [...] The third floor was covered in Peruvian mahogany with French bevel glass mirrors, a mantel of Vermont marble, polished inlaid oak floors, a private <b>slide</b> <b>pole,</b> a massive brass bed, private roof garden, and [...] "a tub big enough for two chiefs." [...] The Times reported: [...] "Notice the Peruvian mahogany carefully, and you will see that the heart of the log has been chosen and that its grain has been placed so that it gives the appearance of real flames. [...] Certainly the esthetic for the reception room of the engine-house de luxe." [...] The chief's apartment alone was reported to have cost $25,000. [...] The Times noted that the quarters rivaled the finest suites in the country, referred to it as a [...] "Sybaritic effort," [...] and offered its sarcastic speculation that the house captain would be expected to [...] "wear evening dress after 6 o'clock, at least." ...|$|R
2500|$|Also part of {{the same}} show was a sway pole {{performance}} by Nock and Wallenda's wife. [...] Using [...] poles that swayed as much as [...] in all directions, the couple did a series of tricks that included climbing up and <b>sliding</b> down the <b>poles,</b> swinging all around, and jumping from pole to pole. [...] In all, sixteen members of the Wallenda family were part of Bellobration.|$|R
50|$|Sidén {{created the}} {{4-channel}} video installation Same Unknown (2008) {{for the occasion}} of Fotografia Europea, in Reggio Emilia, Italy. She invited over 200 people to slide down a metallic pole, {{similar to the ones}} used in old firestations. The resulting video piece, with 4 large monitors mounted vertically in the windows of a multi-story building in Reggio Emilia, shows the participants <b>sliding</b> down the <b>pole</b> after announcing their name and place of birth.|$|R

50|$|The {{village is}} home to the Sea View Yacht Club, founded in 1893. In summer, the village hosts the Seaview Regatta, during which locals and {{tourists}} can take part in many traditional activities, such as the greasy pole where people line up and see how far they can <b>slide</b> along a <b>pole</b> covered in grease. Once they have slipped off, they drop into the sea below. There is also a diving competition and a firework display concludes the event each year.|$|R
2500|$|The New Bedford Fire Museum {{is housed}} in a {{handsome}} red-brick building, formerly Fire Station No. 4, which opened in 1867. [...] The fire station {{was one of the}} oldest continuously operating fire stations in the state when it was closed in 1979. The museum has a collection of old firefighting equipment and some old fire engines. Visitors can try on old uniforms and <b>slide</b> down the <b>pole.</b> Old city fire records dating to 1890 are available for research and review. Retired and active city firefighters act as docents.|$|R

50|$|In an {{interview}} with Chan, he discusses the stunt of <b>sliding</b> down the <b>pole</b> covered with lights. As with the clock tower stunt from Project A (1983), Chan described his fear {{at the thought of}} performing the stunt. However, during the filming of Police Story, there was the added pressure of strict time constraints, as the shopping mall had to be cleaned up and ready for business the following morning. One of Chan's stuntmen gave him a hug and a Buddhist prayer paper, which he put in his trousers before finally performing the stunt.|$|R

60|$|Hugh made no answer, but {{throwing}} the bridle to his master, and snatching his wig from his head, {{in a manner}} so unceremonious and hasty that the action discomposed Mr Willet not a little, though performed at his own special desire, climbed nimbly to the very summit of the maypole before the house, and hanging the wig upon the weathercock, sent it twirling round like a roasting jack. Having achieved this performance, he cast it on the ground, and <b>sliding</b> down the <b>pole</b> with inconceivable rapidity, alighted on his feet {{almost as soon as}} it had touched the earth.|$|R
50|$|Impalement was {{a method}} of torture and {{execution}} whereby a person is pierced with a long stake. The penetration can be through the sides, from the rectum, or through the mouth or vagina. This method would lead to slow, painful, death. Often, the victim was hoisted into the air after partial impalement. Gravity and the victim's own struggles would cause him to <b>slide</b> down the <b>pole.</b> Death could take many days. Impalement was frequently practiced in Asia and Europe throughout the Middle Ages. Vlad III Dracula and Ivan the Terrible have passed into legend as major users of the method.|$|R
5000|$|Dorothy, Button-Bright, the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman {{escape from}} Mombi by {{crossing}} a river on a raft. As {{in the original}} novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900), the Scarecrows barge-pole gets stuck in the river bed and leaves him stranded, until he is rescued by a bird. At one point in this sequence, the Scarecrow <b>slides</b> down the <b>pole</b> into the river, resulting a brief [...] "underwater" [...] sequence featuring puppet fish and a mermaid; throughout, the Scarecrow makes asides to the camera, mostly without intertitles. (At another point, the frozen Gloria even makes a malevolent stare directly into the camera.) ...|$|R
40|$|An {{improved}} {{control algorithm}} {{based on the}} theory of variable structural control or sliding mode control is presented. A method for determining the <b>sliding</b> surface by <b>pole</b> assignment algorithm using complex Fourier coefficients of the incoming earthquake signal applied to the structure is proposed. The design response spectrum is used for estimation of maximum control force for saturated control. Furthermore, a more general theoretical description of the sliding surface {{of the system is}} presented. The potential applications and the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm are demonstrated by numerical examples. The simulation results indicate that a trade-off between the control forces and the structural response is possible. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
