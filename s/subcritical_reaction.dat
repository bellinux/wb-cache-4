40|$|AbstractThe set {{of steady}} state {{solutions}} to a reaction–diffusion equation modeling an autocatalytic chemical reaction is completely determined, when the reactor has spherical geometry, and the spatial dimension is n= 1 or 2 for any reaction order, or n⩾ 3 for <b>subcritical</b> <b>reaction</b> order.

40|$|Consider a {{monotone}} local semiflow in {{the positive}} cone of a strongly ordered Banach space, for which 0 and ∞ are stable attractors, while all nontrivial equilibria are unstable. We prove that under suitable monotonicity, compactness, and smoothness assumptions, the two basins of attraction, B’ and B’’, {{are separated by}} a Lipschitz manifold M of co-dimension one that forms the common boundary of B’ and B’’. This abstract result is applied to a class of semilinear reaction-diffusion equations with superlinear, yet <b>subcritical</b> <b>reaction</b> terms...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a nonlinear parametric Robin problem {{driven by the}} p-Laplacian. We assume that the reaction exhibits a concave term near the origin. First we prove a multiplicity theorem producing three solutions with sign information (positive, negative and nodal) without imposing any growth condition near ± ∞ on the reaction. Then, for problems with <b>subcritical</b> <b>reaction,</b> we produce two more solutions of constant sign, {{for a total of}} five solutions. For the semilinear problem (that is, for p = 2), we generate a sixth solution but without any sign information. Our approach is variational, coupled with truncation, perturbation and comparison techniques and with Morse theory...|$|E
50|$|Another {{direction}} for development is an RTG assisted by <b>subcritical</b> <b>reactions.</b>|$|R
50|$|Because of the {{shortage}} of plutonium-238, {{a new kind of}} RTG assisted by <b>subcritical</b> <b>reactions</b> has been proposed. In this kind of RTG, the alpha decay from the radioisotope is also used in alpha-neutron reactions with a suitable element such as beryllium. This way a long-lived neutron source is produced. Because the system is working with a criticality close to but less than 1, i.e. Keff < 1, a subcritical multiplication is achieved which increases the neutron background and produces energy from fission reactions. Although the number of fissions produced in the RTG is very small (making their gamma radiation negligible), because each fission reaction releases almost 30 times more energy than each alpha decay (200 MeV compared to 6 MeV), up to a 10% energy gain is attainable, which translates into a reduction of the 238Pu needed per mission. The idea was proposed to NASA in 2012 for the yearly NASA NSPIRE competition, which translated to Idaho National Laboratory at the Center for Space Nuclear Research (CSNR) in 2013 for studies of feasibility.. However the essentials are unmodified.|$|R
50|$|The HTL process {{differs from}} {{pyrolysis}} {{as it can}} process wet biomass and produce a bio-oil that contains approximately twice the energy density of pyrolysis oil. Pyrolysis is a related process to HTL, but biomass must be processed and dried {{in order to increase}} the yield. The presence of water in pyrolysis drastically increases the heat of vaporization of the organic material, increasing the energy required to decompose the biomass. Typical pyrolysis processes require a water content of less than 40% to suitably convert the biomass to bio-oil. This requires considerable pretreatment of wet biomass such as tropical grasses, which contain a water content as high as 80-85%, and even further treatment for aquatic species, which can contain higher than 90% water content. Per Algal HTL, the properties of the resulting bio-oil are affected by temperature, reaction time, algae species, algae concentration, reaction atmosphere, and catalysts, in <b>subcritical</b> water <b>reaction</b> conditions.|$|R
50|$|Besides {{nuclear waste}} incineration, there is {{interest}} in this type reactor because it is perceived as inherently safe, unlike a conventional reactor.http://www.roanoke.com/news/nrv/wb/203552 In most types of critical reactors, there exist circumstances in which the rate of fission can increase rapidly, damaging or destroying the reactor and allowing the escape of radioactive material (see SL-1 or Chernobyl disaster). With a <b>subcritical</b> reactor, the <b>reaction</b> will cease unless continually fed neutrons from an outside source. However, the problem of heat generation even after ending the chain reaction remains, so that continuous cooling of such a reactor for a considerable period after shut-down remains vital {{in order to avoid}} overheating.|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a bibliographic review of research {{carried out on}} different alternative processes for biodiesel production. The supercritical and <b>subcritical</b> (non catalytic) <b>reaction</b> conditions, the use of solid basic, solid acid and other heterogeneous catalysts, {{including the use of}} immobilized enzymes and whole-cell catalysts are also critically compared with the traditional homogeneous alkaline or acid catalysts that are common on industrial applications. Advantages and limitations of all these processes for the transference from the laboratory to the industry are discussed. A correlation of the chemical composition with the quality parameters of the produced biodiesel is done with aim to stablish adequate procedures for the right selection of the raw-material. Castor bean oil is used as an example of inappropriate oil in order to produce a B 100 that fulfill all the international physico-chemical quality standards. In this article are presented research results to adequate the values of viscosity, density and iodine number of the castor and soybean biodiesel to the international standard limits by means blending these both biodiesels at the right ratio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Biodiesel is a {{potentially}} sustainably renewable fuel for diesel engines; transesterification {{is the most}} used method to produce it and high quality vegetable oils are the most usual raw material. Non-edible vegetable oils such as castor oil can provide an alternative feedstock. In this work biodiesel was obtained by transesterification of castor oil with <b>subcritical</b> methanol; the <b>reaction</b> {{was carried out in}} an hermetic reactor at temperatures higher than methanol boiling point and {{with a small amount of}} potassium methoxide as catalyst. The effect of methanol:oil molar ratios were analyzed, observing that high proportion of alcohol is needed to reach high ester content, the best results were reached with 24 : 1 MeOH:oil molar ratio. Regarding catalyst concentration, 8. 7 mM (0. 12 wt%) were enough to achieve good results. A temperature of 150 ºC and 1 h of reaction, at 10 bar, were the mildest conditions to reach an ester content higher than 90 wt %. The highest ester content, 94. 7 wt %, was achieved at 220 ºC, 36 bar and 4 h of reaction time. Hence good quality biodiesel from castor oil can be produced in subcritical methanol conditions, using a small amount of basic catalyst. Index Terms—Biodiesel, methanol, subcritical...|$|R
40|$|The most {{prevalent}} criticism of fission-fusion hybrids {{is simply that}} they are too exotic - that they would exacerbate the challenges of both fission and fusion. This is not really true. Intriguingly, hybrids could actually be more viable than stand-alone fusion reactors while mitigating many challenges of fission. This work develops a conceptual design for a fission-fusion hybrid reactor in steady-state L-mode tokamak configuration with a subcritical natural or depleted uranium pebble bed blanket. A liquid lithiumlead alloy breeds enough tritium to replenish that consumed by the D-T fusion <b>reaction.</b> <b>Subcritical</b> operation could obviate the most challenging fuel cycle aspects of fission. The fission blanket augments the fusion power such that the fusion core itself need not have a high power gain, thus allowing for fully non-inductive (steady-state) low confinement mode (L-mode) operation at relatively small physical dimensions. A neutron transport Monte Carlo code models the natural uranium fission blanket. Maximizing the fission power while breeding sufficient tritium allows for the selection of an optimal set of blanket parameters, which yields a maximum prudent fission power gain of 7. 7. A 0 -D tokamak model suffices to analyze approximate tokamak operating conditions. If {{the definition of a}} "reactor" is a device with a total power gain of 40, then this fission blanket would allow the fusion component of a hybrid reactor with the same dimensions as ITER to operate in steady-state L-mode very comfortably with a fusion power gain of 6. 7 and a thermal fusion power of 2. 1 GW. Taking this further can determine the approximate minimum scale for a steady-state L-mode tokamak hybrid reactor, which is a major radius of 5. 2 in and an aspect ratio of 2. 8. This minimum scale device operates barely within the steady-state L-mode realm with a thermal fusion power of 1. 7 GW. This hybrid, with its very fast neutron spectrum, could be superior to pure fission reactors in terms of breeding fissile fuel and transmuting deleterious fission products. It could operate either as a breeder, producing fuel for pure fission reactors from natural or depleted uranium, or as a deep burner, fissioning heavy metal and transmuting waste with a cycle time of decades. Despite a plethora of potential functions, its primary mission is deemed to be that of a deep burner producing baseload commercial power with a once-through fuel cycle. Although hybrids are often purported a priori to pose an elevated proliferation risk, this reactor breeds plutonium that could actually be more proliferation-resistant than that bred by fast reactors. Furthermore, a novel method (the "variable fixed source method") can maintain constant total hybrid power output as burnup proceeds by varying the neutron source strength. As for engineering feasibility, basic thermal hydraulic analysis demonstrates that pressurized helium could cool the pebble bed fission blanket with a flow rate below 10 m/s. The Brayton cycle thermal efficiency is 41 %. This device is dubbed the Steady-State L-Mode Non-Enriched Uranium Tokamak Hybrid (SLEUTH). The purpose of this work is not any sort of elaborate design, but rather the exploration of an idea coupled with corroborating numerical analysis. At this point in the hybrid debate, viable conceptual designs are persuasive while intricate build-ready designs are superfluous. This work conceives such a conceptual design, demonstrates its viability, and will perhaps, incidentally, spur a profusion of pro-fusion sentiment!by Mark Wilbert Reed. Thesis (S. M.)
