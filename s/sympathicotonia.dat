The author {{examined}} the autonomic functional state of preoperative and post-operative condition in urolithiasis with pharmacodynamic tests and mechanical tests. I. Pharmacodynamic test Varieties of the re s p onses manifested by {{the patients were}} classified into four groups according to the exhibited type of manifestation : Type V, Type VS, Type S and Type 0. Any subject responding to either adrenaline or pilocarpine or to both was labelled as autonomically dystonic. Name of <b>sympathicotonia</b> was given to those subjects who were more sensitive to adrenaline than to pilocarpine, while the name of vagotonia was given {{to those who were}} more sensitive to pilocarpine than to adrenaline. 1) Of 158 patients with urinary calculi, there were 6 1 cases (37. 9 %) with <b>sympathicotonia</b> and there were 130 cases (82. 2 %) with parasympathicotonia, including 44 cases (27. 8 %) of Type VS. 2) Of 158 pat i e nts with urinary calculi, there were 147 cases (93. 0 %) with positive signs of autonomic dystonia, including 86 cases (54. 4 %) of vagotonia. These autonomic dystonia of urolithiasis continured mo r e over in postoperative condition 3) In multiple or recurrent stone formating patients also the author recognized the autonomic dystonia with more sensitive to pilocarpine. 4) In urolithiasis, the type of respon s e of autonomic functional condition with pharmacodynamic tests was scarcely changed after and before operation. If the type was changed, its change was the transition from the unstable autonomic type to the other, and it scarcely happened that the change was to statable type. II.

40|$|Background. Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} (RA) {{belongs to}} the most common inflammatory diseases of the joints, {{and the number of}} these patients is increasing everywhere causing enormous medical, social and economic damage. An important role in the pathogenesis of RA is given to the violations of the autonomic neural system (ANS) functions, whose condition is closely related to the rheological properties of the blood serum (RPBS). The purpose and objectives. To evaluate the correlation between «vegetative passport» of RA patients and autonomic dysfunction with RPBS at different variations of the disease. Materials and methods. We have examined 173 patients aged 18 to 79 years (on the average 46 years), among them 21 % were males and 79 % — females. The duration of disease manifestation was 10 years, type of RA seropositive for rheumatoid factor and citrulline antibodies was detected in 3 / 4 of cases, extraarticular (systemic) form of the disease was diagnosed in 37 % of cases. The surface indicators of the blood serum — viscosity, elasticity, tension, relaxation and viscoelasticity modulus — were determined using digital tensio­meter PAT 2 -Sinterface (Germany). Results. «Ve­getative passport» defines the integral clinical, laboratory and instrumental signs of RA, wherein the severity of autono­mic dysfunction is directly correlated with the rate of joint pathology progression, and in <b>sympathicotonia</b> — with the baseline parameters of rheumatoid factor in the blood and the degree of RA activity. Changes in RPBS are accompanied by an increase in the steady-state (static) surface tension, which are recorded in 70 % of cases. Integral state of interfacial activity, relaxation and viscoelastic characteristics of the blood determine the type of ANS and the presence of autonomic dysfunction in patients (patients with vagotonia are characterized by increase in viscoelastic modulus and decrease of surface tension, with <b>sympathicotonia</b> — by increase in surface tension and reduced surface viscosity). RPBS parameters are associated with the severity of autonomic disorders, and the surface viscosity index has a prognostic value. Conclusions. The development of autonomic dysfunction is correlated not only with the features of the course of articular syndrome and extraarticular RA symptoms, but also with the state of ANS, which is involved in RPBS disorders. In the future, the assessment of ANS state will be useful for subsequent timely rehabi­litation measures of the disease...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{present a}} profile of panic {{disorder}} based on and generalized {{from the effects of}} acute and chronic hyperventilation that are characteristic of the respiratory panic disorder subtype. The review presented attempts to integrate three premises: hyperventilation is a physiological response to hypercapnia; hyperventilation can induce panic attacks; chronic hyperventilation is a protective mechanism against panic attacks. METHOD: A selective review of the literature was made using the Medline database. Reports of the interrelationships among panic disorder, hyperventilation, acidosis, and alkalosis, as well as catecholamine release and sensitivity, were selected. The findings were structured into an integrated model. DISCUSSION: The panic attacks experienced by individuals with panic disorder develop on the basis of metabolic acidosis, which is a compensatory response to chronic hyperventilation. The attacks are triggered by a sudden increase in (pCO 2) when the latent (metabolic) acidosis manifests as hypercapnic acidosis. The acidotic condition induces catecholamine release. <b>Sympathicotonia</b> cannot arise during the hypercapnic phase, since low pH decreases catecholamine sensitivity. Catecholamines can provoke panic when hyperventilation causes the hypercapnia to switch to hypocapnic alkalosis (overcompensation) and catecholamine sensitivity begins to increase.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{proposes a}} noninvasive method for {{estimating}} the viscoelastic characteristics of arterial walls using pulse waves measured {{in various parts}} of the body using a foil-type pressure sensor (FPS) and a photoplethysmogram. The FPS was employed to measure pulse waves based on the tonometry approach for its characteristics of high sensitivity and flexibility as well as its ability to continuously measure the alternating-current component of pulse waves. First, in order to accurately measure the amplitude variation of blood pressure waves, suitable mechanical forces externally applied to the FPS were examined, and it was found that values of 5 – 25 [N] yielded the best performance. Next, to verify the time characteristics of pulse waves, the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) was measured. The results showed that baPWV determined using the FPS and that found with a noninvasive vascular screening device were almost the same. Estimation was then performed to establish arterial viscoelastic indices for the radial artery and the dorsal pedis artery during the application of mechanical pain stimuli. The results suggested that the estimated indices could be used to quantitatively assess vascular response caused by <b>sympathicotonia.</b> Thus, it was concluded that the proposed method enabled noninvasive measurement of pulse waves and estimation of viscoelastic indices...|$|E

Chronodiagnostics, using non-linear symbolic dynamics method and redundancy quotient of ECG PI, RespI and R– R intervals; differential temperature survey to evaluate cellular immunity; biocontrolled laser therapy. Results Self-regulation reserve reduction of oxygen transfer body systems and increase in unfavourable response probability under stress load are accompanied by the amplitude and fluctuation increase of redundancy quotient in the ECG IPI, RespI and R–R intervals, as well as increase of hierarchical desynchronosis with dominating <b>sympathicotonia</b> and vagotonia, decrease in cellular immunity, reduction in rate spectrum of the ECG IPI and R–R intervals. Conclusion Symbolic dynamics method provides distinction between age-related and abnormal changes in hierarchy of cardiac rhythms. The amplitude and fluctuation increase of redundancy quotient indicates the increase of control intensity with oxygen transfer body systems and predicts the reduction of self-regulation reserve in cardiac rhythms and unfavourable response probability. ...|$|E

The duration of each test was 10 minutes. Synchronization was estimated as a phase difference between 0. 1 Hz-rhythms in heart rate and in filling of blood microcirculation. Quantitative measures of synchronization were also estimated. In addition frequency values of HRV spectrum in LF- and HF-ranges were assessed. Enalapril and Metoprolol had comparable effect on blood pressure reduction. Treatment with both Enalapril and Metoprolol in patients with significant vegetative dysfunction resulted in repair of functional interaction between 0. 1 Hz-regulation of heart and blood microcirculation. Enalapril was preferred in hypertensive patients with prevalence of disorders of vegetative regulation of blood microcirculation. Metoprolol influenced positively on 0, 1 Hz-rhythm synchronization in patients with predominance of heart vegetative regulation dysfunction and in patients with <b>sympathicotonia.</b> In patients with hypertension and initially normal level of synchronization of 0. 1 Hz-mechanisms treatment with Enalapril or Metoprolol caused functional dissociation.

At the second stage, the athletes (boys) of the initial training group were selected from the surveyed contingent, engaged in martial arts. The groups were formed: A – people with violation of myocardial repolarization processes (72 patients, the average age 10, 50 ± 0, 35 years), the control group – people without changes in an electrocardiogram (33 people, the average age 10. 36 ± 0, 62 years old). All underwent an electrocardiographic study at rest and after physical activity on the Innomed HS 80 GL apparatus with analysis of the main indicators. The vegetative status and the state of adaptation were estimated by Kerdo index and adaptive potential by Baevsky. After the examination, the subgroup A 1 (40 people) was prescribed metabolic and antioxidant drugs. Additionally, in the subgroup A 2 (32 people), a non-selective beta-blocker was included in the treatment regimen. The course of treatment is 10 days.

40|$|Exploring the {{mechanisms}} of vegetative regulation {{in children and adolescents}} of different somatotypes has a prognostic value in regard to the character of adaptive reactions of the organism, as it facilitates the identification of the risk factors of pathological processes and states of vegetative systems, which may cause chronic illness in adulthood. The author defines the pathogenic specifics of development of vegetative dysfunction in adolescents in relation to their morphological status. Cardiointervalography and anthropometric, mathematical and statistical methods of research were used. Based on the results of cardiointervalography, the structure of initial vegetative tonus was established, which was characterized by prevalence of eutonia (38. 4 ± 4. 9 %). The specific weight with background eutonia of adolescent boys and girls tended to be higher among the representatives of the thoracic and muscular somatotypes, compared to adolescents of the alimentive and osseous somatotypes (Р < 0. 001 – 0. 05). The established specifics indicate that thoracic and muscular somatotypes ensure optimal adaptation of organisms to the environment. <b>Sympathicotonia</b> was measured among the majority of boys of extreme constitutional variants (alimentive and osseous somatotypes) (36. 3 % and 30. 0 % respectively), which demonstrates the activation of adaptive mechanisms in the abovementioned category of examined adolescents, while among girls this phenomenon was evident among the representatives of the osseous and thoracic somatotypes (38. 5 % and 30. 8 % respectively). We found that the majority of examined adolescents (53. 4 %) had a normal vegetative reactivity. Gender differences in the structure of vegetative reactivity of adolescents could well be explained by the higher number of girls of asympaticotonic type (19. 2 %) compared to boys (7. 3 %, Р < 0. 05). Furthermore, we found that hypersympathicotonic and asympathicotonic types of vegetative reactivity were characteristic of the majority of representatives of the alimentive and osseous somatotypes irrespective of the gender, which indicates activation of functioning of the cardiovascular system, decreased adaptive capacity of the organism among the examined group. The research shows that the group at risk of developing functional deviations in vegetative systems is formed by the representatives of the alimentive and osseous somatotypes...|$|E
40|$|The study {{involved}} 32 children aged from 11 - 12 who were receiving training in sports schools in Sumy. The children {{were divided into}} three study groups with high, medium {{and low levels of}} sensorimotor reactivity, defined in terms of complex visual-motor response. The study methods were psychophysiological, cardiointervalography, mathematical and statistical. We found that the majority of individuals with a medium level of sensorimotor reactivity possessed vegetative tonus, characterized by background emphotony, while <b>sympathicotonia</b> was prevalent in the group of athletes {{with a high level of}} sensorimotor reactivity, in comparison with those with medium and low levels of sensorimotor reactivity. Vegetative imbalance that manifests via hypersympaticotonic reactivity occurred among athletes with high and medium levels of sensorimotor reactivity, which is the evidence of stress on the cardiovascular system, decline of adaptive capacity of the organism in the individuals investigated. Shorter latent periods of complex visual-motor responses (LP SR 1 – 3 and LP SR 2 – 3) were observed among athletes with hypersympaticotonic vegetative reactivity, compared to sportsmen with normal type of vegetative reactivity (P < 0. 05). Analysis of indicators of heart rate variability revealed an increased activity of the sympathoadrenal system in athletes with a high level of sensorymotor response, which is confirmed by significantly lower values of SDNN and RMSSD in comparison with athletes with a low level of sensorymotor response. The activation of central regulation in athletes with a high level of sensorimotor responses also show significantly higher values IN and Amo, in comparison with athletes with a low level of sensorymotor response. The figures IN (47. 7 %), and Amo (45. 3 %) were those most effected by the level of sensorimotor reactivity. Less effected were figures of SDNN (43. 1 %), which reflects general heart rate variability and RMSSD (43. 1 %), which reflects high frequency components of heart rate. Analysis of change in dynamics of figures of heart rate variability provides evidence of higher activity of the sympathoadrenal system in athletes with a high level of sensorimotor reactivity, which facilitates increased stress on heart rhythm vegetative regulation mechanisms, accompanied by decline of parasympathetic influences of the vegetative nervous system...|$|E
40|$|There are {{published}} many {{reports of the}} clinical tests of the autonomic nervous tonus. R. Exner (1948). emphasized that oxygen consumption and pulse rate vary with the correlation under the certain tonic states of the autonomic nervous system, moreover that, his method elucidates the autonomic tonicity from these two correlative values with special regards to in-, or decrease of body weight. As a rule, general <b>sympathicotonia</b> or vagotonia appears seldom in the clinical practice. The unsatisfactoriness of the tests hitherto in use depends upon that sympathico-, or parasympathicotropic hypertonus is rather confined to partial somatic symptoms or to functional states of several organs, {{and that there is}} usually found the intermingled condition of sympathico-, and parasympathicotonia. In order to investigate the clinical significance of Exner 2 ̆ 7 s test, author reexamined Exner 2 ̆ 7 s method and observed the influence of several autonomic agents upon the result of his test. Spirometer in the type of Benedict-Roth was used in this experiment as well as Exner 2 ̆ 7 s procedure. For the purpose to estimate oxygen consumption, the basal metabolism was determined with Knipping 2 ̆ 7 s apparatus. And the respiratory curves were analysed. Before the application of the autonomic agents according to Exner 2 ̆ 7 s proposal, the standard form (2 ̆ 2 Grundform 2 ̆ 2) was determined and thereafter studied the effects of the agents upon the patterns classified by Exner, moreover the fluctuation, of Manoiloff-Kroll reaction and of blood sugar and etc. were simultaneously examined. The types of the spirograms registered in 121 cases were devided into three. The 2 ̆ 2 irregular 2 ̆ 2 spirograms can be more frequently seen in patients suffered from essential and juvenile hypertension, hyperthyroidism, lastly functional cardiac diseases than in normal health. Fifty cases were classified into the standard forms according to Fxner 2 ̆ 7 s plan. Normal health and essential hypertension predominate in 2 ̆ 2 stenic normal 2 ̆ 2 form, hyperthyroidism in 2 ̆ 2 sympathicotropic 2 ̆ 2, functional cardiac diseases and hysteria in 2 ̆ 2 asthenic 2 ̆ 2, while 2 ̆ 2 parasympathicotropic 2 ̆ 2 is dominantly observed in various incretoric disorders, except for the 2 ̆ 2 undetermined 2 ̆ 2 form in 5 cases. Some corrections may be necessary as to the relationship pointed out by Exner between pulse rate and oxygen consumption; the reason can be explained as follows. (a) Normal pattern among 50 cases can be found only in one case suffered from pulmonary stenosis companied with palpitation as chief complain. As to pulse rate and basal metabolic value, 2 ̆ 2 sthenic normal 2 ̆ 2 pattern can be observed in 23 cases without tendency to decrease in body weight. So that, to speak strictly, it may not be classified to any group of patterns. (b) The interrelation between pulse and basal metabolic rates is studied on 288 cases. Both values run, in a certain extent, parallel with each other; however such cases are found lesser than those observed by Exner. (c) In organic heart diseases, pulse rates depend upon not only cardiac, but also extracardiac factors, consequently Exner 2 ̆ 7 s method can hardly be applied. (d) From the results of the responses to autonomic agents, it may be safe to say that both pulse and basal metabolic rates change almost indifferently from Exner 2 ̆ 7 s assumption. Responses to autonomic agents do not show a difinite characteristic correlation to the tonicity determined before the examination. (a) Norepinephrine, Priscol 2 ̆ 2 Ciba 2 ̆ 2, Reserpine (Serpasil 2 ̆ 2 Ciba 2 ̆ 2) and Deserpidine 2 ̆ 2 Ciba 2 ̆ 2 alter scarcely the patterns classified by Exner. (b) Atropine and Ansolysen 2 ̆ 2 Dai Nippon Seiyaku 2 ̆ 2 set up 2 ̆ 2 adynamic 2 ̆ 2 pattern accompanied with tachycardia. (c) Epinephrine elicites 2 ̆ 2 sympathicotropic 2 ̆ 2 type. (d) Chlorpromazine does not show a certain mode of response, nearly among a half of cases, but there occurs the slight decrease in basal metabolism. In hyperthyroidism, tachycardia as well as arrhythmia appear by means of this medication. (e) Mode of variation of either Manoiloff-Kroll 2 ̆ 7 s test or blood sugar does not always agree with that of results of Exner 2 ̆ 7 s test. So far as the limits above mentioned are considered into the interpretation of Exner 2 ̆ 7 s test, his method may be evaluated as one of the indication of the autonomic tonus at the given time-point...|$|E
