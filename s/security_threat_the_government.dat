5000|$|In 1956, Chen {{founded the}} Singapore Women's Federation (SWF) {{as a group}} to press for women’s rights and {{simultaneously}} fight against colonialism and a social order which favored the English. She and other radicals believed women’s struggle for equality was linked to social change and class struggle. The organization was shut down immediately and Chen was arrested, {{accused of being a}} <b>security</b> <b>threat.</b> <b>The</b> <b>government</b> issued a statement that she was to be deported to China, but some legislators argued that since she had lived in Singapore since she was five, she was not an alien. Both Chen and her parents plead for her to be sent to Britain to finish her studies. She spent 20 months in prison before her release in 1958. That same year she married Tan Seng Huat, who she had met during her student days. She became a lecturer in the History of Southeast Asia at Nanyang University and completed her masters with a thesis on Early Chinese Newspapers in Singapore: 1881-1912. She returned to women's rights issues and participated in the debates and planning for the Women's Charter to revise the marriage laws of Singapore.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, we {{consider}} the social welfare maximization problem facing a government confronting a potential future <b>security</b> <b>threat.</b> <b>The</b> <b>government</b> must choose how much to devote to long lead time military expenditures. The government must also choose whether to run fiscal surpluses or deficits. We show that the government may optimize social welfare by accumulating a precautionary surplus or (more surprisingly) a precautionary deficit. In {{the event that the}} government is constrained to maintain budget balance, however, the social optimum is achieved by either increasing long lead time defense expenditures above the level that minimizes expected social costs in the unconstrained case or (more surprisingly) by reducing long lead time expenditures to below the level that would otherwise minimize expected social costs...|$|E

The rise of Salafism also posed a growing <b>security</b> <b>threat.</b> <b>The</b> Troika <b>government</b> reasserted state control over 80 percent of the mosques that had {{been taken over by}} extremists in the chaotic period immediately after the revolution.|$|R
25|$|Back to the regained {{independence}} in 1961, Adnan Quwatli, {{a professor of}} Law linked to business community, was appointed Interior Minister; on 15 December 1961 Colonel Muhammad Hisham al-Samman was appointed Commander of Internal Security Forces, assisted by a Committee under his presidency and including the Directors-General of Police and Public Security and six provincial superintendents. <b>The</b> Kuzbari <b>government</b> pledeged to establish political liberties and to disestablish emergency laws; despite this, the civil police forces {{are believed to have}} been used extensively to combat internal <b>security</b> <b>threats</b> to <b>the</b> <b>government,</b> including pro-Nasserites Baathists and other secular socialists (opposed to the business-Islamist alliance), especially in the universities, which were subjected to several forms of control; also trade unions were harshly confronted by the police in 1962.|$|R
5|$|In 1996, John Howard led the Liberal Party's {{election}} campaign and became Prime Minister. Subsequently, {{there were significant}} reforms to the ADF's force structure and role. <b>The</b> new <b>government's</b> defence strategy placed less emphasis on defending Australia from direct attack and greater emphasis on working in co-operation with regional states and Australia's allies to manage potential <b>security</b> <b>threats.</b> From 1997 <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> also implemented a series of changes to the ADF's force structure {{in an attempt to}} increase the proportion of combat units to support units and improve the ADF's combat effectiveness.|$|R
40|$|Presented thesis {{analyzes}} the Icelandic fisheries {{as a national}} interest {{and its role in}} foreign policy. Importance of fisheries confirms {{the fact that in the}} first half of the twentieth century marine products accounted for over 90 % of Iceland's exports and the Icelandic economy was fully dependent on one sector. Gradual diversification of the economy in the seventies, however, caused a decline in exports of fish products to one-third of total exports. The thesis assumes that the Icelandic fisheries have a significant impact on foreign policy, even though its economic importance is declining. The research is carried out on three historical events, such as the cod wars in the fifties and the seventies, mackerel dispute in 2010 and the withdrawal of Iceland's application to the EU in 2015. It would be expected that due to the economic ties and Icelandic membership in international organizations (NATO, EFTA) <b>the</b> Icelandic <b>government</b> would primarily seek peaceful solutions in international conflicts. However, it could be observed in the Icelandic case that due to the pressure of the domestic politics <b>the</b> <b>government</b> does not respond as it would be expected. According to the neoclassical realism the thesis should verify a hypothesis that in a case of <b>security</b> <b>threat,</b> <b>the</b> Icelandic <b>government</b> will give [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The major {{impetus for}} the {{establishment}} of the KPRAF was <b>the</b> <b>security</b> <b>threat</b> faced by <b>the</b> <b>government</b> in Phnom Penh. Internally this <b>threat</b> consisted of <b>the</b> armed insurgents belonging to the three CGDK components. The total strength of the three forces was impossible to gauge with any precision; it may possibly have reached between 55,000 and 75,000 combatants, {{but it could have been}} considerably less than that figure. The insurgent forces were incapable of mounting a sustained offensive and of massing for any tactical operation beyond sporadic patrols in companies, because they could not overcome their destructive factional rivalries. Least of all were they able to bring down <b>the</b> Phnom Penh <b>government.</b> They were capable, however, of keeping Cambodia in a permanent state of insecurity; they raised the cost to Hanoi of its large military presence in the country; and, backed by China, they offered a persistent obstacle to the coalescence of an Hanoi-dominated Indochinese federation.|$|R
40|$|Transnational {{criminal}} investigations are being undertaken with increasing frequency. This {{is in part}} owing to the rising number of occasions in which any given domestic criminal investigation, particularly the investigation of serious crime involving the sourcing, transmission and distribution of illicit commodities, will encounter transnational criminal markets and so necessitate acquiring evidence from a foreign jurisdiction (Jones and Doobay 2005 : 362). Secondly, it is in part owing to the increasing political priority accorded to transnational organised crime as <b>governments</b> raise <b>the</b> profile of the phenomenon by incorporating it in their strategic assessments of national <b>security</b> <b>threats</b> (White House 1998, Cabinet Office 2008 : para 3. 14 - 3. 17). In articulating its official response to national <b>security</b> <b>threats,</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom <b>Government</b> identified <b>the</b> following core values as underpinning its strategy: protection of human rights; adherence {{to the rule of}} law; legitimate and accountable government; the related socio-political values of justice, freedom, tolerance; and opportunity for all (Cabinet Office 2008 : para 2. 1).

5000|$|The Party is {{regarded}} as a serious <b>security</b> <b>threat</b> and <b>the</b> Indian <b>government</b> is taking countermeasures, pulling the affected states together to co-ordinate their response. It says it will combine improved policing with socio-economic measures to defuse grievances that fuel the Maoist cause.In 2005, Chhattisgarh State sponsored an anti-Maoist movement called the Salwa Judum.

These allegations were rejected by a fact-finding commission of the National Human Rights Commission of India, appointed by the Supreme Court of India, who determined that the Salwa Judum was a spontaneous reaction by tribes against Maoist atrocities perpetrated against them. The camps are guarded by police officers, paramilitary forces and child soldiers empowered with the official title [...] "special police officer" [...] (SPO).However, on 5 July 2011, the Supreme Court of India declared the Salwa Judum as illegal and unconstitutional.
