5|$|The <b>Social</b> <b>Institutions</b> and Gender Index (SIGI) is a {{recently}} developed measure of gender inequality calculated by analyzing <b>social</b> <b>institutions,</b> societal practices, and legal norms {{and how these}} factors largely frame gender norms within a society. By combining these sources of inequality, SIGI is able to penalize high levels of inequality {{in each of the}} applicable dimensions, allowing for only partial compensation by the gaps between the remaining dimensions and the highly inequitable one. Through its analysis of the institutional sources of gender inequality in over 100 countries, SIGI has been proven to add new insights into outcomes for women, even when other factors such as religion and region of the world are controlled for.|$|E

However, the geographical insularity of Kerala from the rest of the country has resulted in the development of a distinctive lifestyle, art, architecture, language, literature and <b>social</b> <b>institutions.</b> Over 10,000 festivals are celebrated in the state every year.

5|$|Much of Durkheim's {{work was}} {{concerned}} with how societies could maintain their integrity and coherence in modernity; {{an era in which}} traditional social and religious ties are no longer assumed, and in which new <b>social</b> <b>institutions</b> have come into being. His first major sociological work was The Division of Labour in Society (1893). In 1895, he published The Rules of Sociological Method and set up the first European department of sociology, becoming France's first professor of sociology. In 1898, he established the journal L'Année Sociologique. Durkheim's seminal monograph, Suicide (1897), a study of suicide rates in Catholic and Protestant populations, pioneered modern social research and served to distinguish social science from psychology and political philosophy. The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life (1912) presented a theory of religion, comparing the social and cultural lives of aboriginal and modern societies.|$|E

40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{message of}} Nedelsky's {{book is that}} private property is a <b>social</b> <b>institution,</b> collectively defined and collectively enforced. Property is of course a <b>social</b> <b>institution,</b> not a natural right. But there is no inherent contradiction, as Nedelsky seems to believe there is, between the idea that property is a <b>social</b> <b>institution</b> {{and the idea that}} the law - another <b>social</b> <b>institution</b> - should protect reliance interests associated with specific property rights. Property is a <b>social</b> <b>institution</b> {{in the sense that it}} emerges from customary forms of interaction among people with respect to specific material resources, and then is defined and protected against private interference by state law. The constitutional protection of property is also a <b>social</b> <b>institution,</b> but it involves a different source of law (the federal Constitution rather than state law), different institutional actors (ultimately the federal courts), and different objectives (protecting specific entitlements against public rather than private interference). Thus, the fact that both processes are "social" does not mean that they collapse into a single undifferentiated mass. Moreover, neither the social origins of property as an <b>institution,</b> nor the <b>social</b> nature of the constitutional protections we recognize, tells us much about what collective measures may be adopted (at either the state or the federal level) to reallocate relative shares of fungible wealth. We are fortunate that the Founders of our nation, most prominently James Madison, understood these distinctions. What is puzzling is that so many contemporary American academics would like to obscure them...|$|R
