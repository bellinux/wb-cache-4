It has ignited huge interest, and many researchers were looking forward for its development (Blachut 1976, Kraus et al. 1976). However, after around twenty years, interest in stereo-orthophoto has shrunk, and during eighties of XX century it was almost extinct. Despite of fact that digital photogrammetry provides better conditions for it now than ever, it has never got chance for reactivation. There was but few papers about stereo orthoimage, and they are proposing continuous stereo ortho-mosaic generation while preserving its metric value (Li et al 2002, Wang 2004). Reasons of downfall of this interest were examined, and it has been concluded that the main cause was usage of this technique in conjunction with analog photogrammetry. The radiometric value of orthophotomaps and stereo components developed on photosensitive paper were very low during that time. Equipment for observation and measurement were simply very big and therefore impractical. Authors have concluded, that nowadays sum of gains outweighs its flaws and it is reason enough to go back to it. But in a time of digital vector 3 D models there is a need for proper strategy for popularization <b>stereo</b> <b>orthophoto.</b> Main point of this strategy would be encapsulating stereo orthoimage method into GIS tools, optimally open source. GIS have large numbers of consumers whom regard for orthophotomap (or orthoimage) is very high. If they were to be proposed with possibility of using stereo orthoimage inside a GIS tool, as a complementary to the orthophotomap, probably they would recon how much stereoscopy helps with interpretation of an image. Authors have planned to develop software for utilization of stereo orthoimage available from the Quantum GIS interface, and test version is to be based on anaglyph stereoscopy. Value of creating continuous stereo-mosaic composed from many 3 D models was assessed. Consensus was, however, that this solution surprises us with frequent perspective changes which leads to discomfort. As an outcome it was decided to focus on single stereo orthoimage pairs. When area constrains are specified for single model, one can load them as requested by an user. In case of increased lateral and longitudinal coverage, which is more common in modern aerial photogrammetric flights, every localization will be accessible for visualization using several models, and there will be less concealed areas. Few algorithms for generation of parallax are tested. After completion of sets from a dozen or so example models of interesting areas are gathered, there will be release. Authors are confident that stereo orthoimage may prove more useful for GIS users than true orthophotomap...|$|E
40|$|Digital {{orthoimage}} (or orthophoto) {{is a type}} of information-rich digital {{products and}} has found applications in many fields. However, digital orthoimage itself is a 2 -dimensional product and therefore it is insufficient for many applications. On the other hand, the traditional stereo model of photogrammetry formed from a pair of overlapping aerial photographs offer the possibility of both 3 D measurement of terrain surface and terrain objects. However, it cannot be used a plan like the case of digital orthoimage and the model size is usually limited to the stereo pair. To take the advantage of both, the concept of stereomate was introduced by Collins in 1968. It is a new image with additional relief displacement. The total amount of relief displacement at each point of the stereomate is exactly the same as the sum of two relief displacements at the same position on both images of the stereo pair. That is, if this stereomate is used together with the orthoimage, one is still able to reconstruct a 3 D surface of the area precisely. The main limitation with the current practice is that if more than one stereo pairs are used to generate the <b>stereo</b> <b>orthophoto</b> pair, the solution is not rigorous and thus leads to low accuracy of 3 D measurement in highly mountainous areas although reasonable accuracy of 3 D measurement can be achieved in areas with low relief. This paper introduces the concept of “measurable seamless stereo model”, which is formed by a mosaic orthoimage and a mosaic stereomate (i. e. mosaics of a whole block of aerial photographs), with the lineage (image coordinates on original photograph and the orientation parameters of the original photograph) of each pixel on both mosaic orthoimage and a mosaic stereomate recorded. Such a measurable seamless stereo model not only provides seamless 3 D landscape environment but also offers the rigorous and thus accurate 3 D measurement of any object and feature visible in the measurable seamless stereo model withou...|$|E
40|$|The Terrain Resources Inventory Mapping (TRIM) data {{standard}} in BC, Canada, includes speci cations for river data and elevation {{data that are}} typically met by interpretation of <b>stereo</b> <b>orthophotos.</b> It does not specify that breaklines for watersheds be interpreted from the photos, thus we must extract them from the data. We seek a system of watersheds that, while not exact due to errors in the data, is at least self-consistent { having no overlapping watersheds and no unclassi ed points. We build a TIN terrain model using a Delaunay triangulation that combines both river and elevation data. Based on the standard denition of water ow along steepest-descent paths, we create an algorithm that identies ridges and channels in the TIN, and extracts watersheds. Several unexpected geometric congurations, which {{we have not seen}} in the literature, follow from the standard denitions. These must be correctly computed to obtain a consistent system of watersheds. ...|$|R
40|$|Caused by the {{turbulent}} atmosphere, the original airborne line scanner images are partially strongly deformed against normal case images {{and the ground}} coordinate system. An automatic matching requires a special program which can use the available orientation information {{from a combination of}} relative kinematic GPS-positioning and inertial measurement system (IMU). Another possibility is the rectification of the line scanner images to a chosen height level using the camera orientation for every single line. Such rectified images are displaced by the actual ground height and the view direction – {{especially in the case of}} inclined lines. The geometry is very close to the geometry of <b>stereo</b> <b>orthophotos,</b> also a <b>stereo</b> view is possible. With these rectified images an automatic image matching is possible by programs based on the region growing method like program DPCOR and with a special program the ground coordinates of digital elevation models (DEM) can be computed with the matched corresponding pixel positions of the rectification’s and the sensor orientation. Exactly the same situation is given by the GEO-product of IKONOS-images. They are also rectified to a chosen height level. For the ortho-rectification of IKONOS GEO-products it is not necessary to use the full sensor orientation, the available nominal collection azimuth and elevation is totally sufficient. If control points in different height levels are available, also this information is not required for an optimal geometric correction shown at an example in...|$|R
40|$|Since December 2004 the Institut Cartogràfic de Catalunya (ICC) {{has taken}} more than 135 000 digital aerial images with two Digital Mapping Cameras (DMC) from ZEISS/INTERGRAPH (Z/I). After three years of {{experience}} and with the new, fully digital, production lines well established, this paper analyses {{the performance of the}} digital camera in a true production environment, specially compared to the older production lines based on digitized analogue images. The accuracy assessment is studied for every single step of the mapping production line: aerial triangulation, DEM (Digital Elevation Model) generation, <b>stereo</b> plotting and <b>orthophoto</b> quality (image resolution). DMC images of 45 cm and 7. 5 cm pixel size, from several production projects, are analysed and the results are compared to the respective results of analogue workflows (with the same pixel size when scanned at 15 μm). The accuracy assessment for the aerial triangulation and stereo plotting is done with independent check points and with Lidar data for the DEM evaluation. The analysis of the photointerpretation is based on the observations of experienced and well trained operators. To asses the resolution of DMC images, a tool based on the computation of the Line Spread Function has been developed. The method takes into account the distance of this kind of structures {{to the center of the}} image, both along and across flight direction, in order to quantify the effective resolution power of the DMC and the analogue images. Final conclusions are drawn from the performance analysis of the aerial triangulation, DEM generation, stereo plotting and image resolution in a production environment. 1...|$|R
40|$|Rover {{localization}} {{is essential}} to the exploration of space. The availability of sub-meter resolution satellite imagery, especially HiRISE imagery, has opened the possibility of computing rover locations at higher accuracy by making use of detailed features seen in the satellite orbital images. This paper describes a new development towards automation of the rover localization process using orbital and ground images. Using a rigorous sensor model and bundle adjustment (BA) of HiRISE <b>stereo</b> imagery, high-resolution <b>orthophotos</b> and DEMs can be generated as soon as the orbital stereo images are acquired. A ground image network is also constructed using intra- and inter-stereo matching. From both types of imagery, a few landmarks are identified to be used as ground control points for the integration of the orbital and ground image networks. Rocks detected from both orbital and ground imagery serve as tie points for rover localization. From orbital images, rocks are extracted based on brightness values and the shape of dark spots. Rocks in ground images are extracted through dense stereo matching, rock peak and surface point extraction, and rock modeling. To narrow down a precise rover position, terrain match is performed using DEMs generated from orbital and ground imagery. Finally, distribution pattern matching is implemented for rocks detected from orbital and ground imagery. The rover position is adjusted based on 2 D affine transformation obtained from rock pattern matching. The proposed method has been tested for the Spirit rover traverse. Experimental results show that the orbital/ground rock matching approach has performed successfully for MER rover localization...|$|R
40|$|Field investigations, {{including}} detailed geological and geomorphological mapping {{have been}} coupled with stratigraphic and structural {{studies of the}} Blais Creek Deep-seated Gravitational Slope Deformations (DsGSD), Monashee Mountains, British Columbia (BC). To reconstruct the DsGSD evolutionary stages and to evaluate its controlling factors, a complex methodology has been applied, integrating <b>orthophotos,</b> <b>stereo</b> models and 3 D models of the DsGSD with field and literature data concerning tectonic and glacial history of the Seymour Valley. General geomechanical properties of the deforming rock mass has been then evaluated for using in numerical models of the failure mechanism at Blais Creek and to define a broad geomechanical characterization of different portions of the DsGSD. The combination between the aerial and terrestrial photogrammetry was appropriate {{in terms of the}} quality of the information obtained more than the quantitative information. Several Ground Control Points (GCPs) and Tie Points (TPs) were selected from the original DEM received by the BC Government. The use of a multitemporal aerial triangulation gave the possibility to minimize the error relative to every single block of images. Couples of oriented photos were used to create stereoscopic models. Multitemporal variations of the Blais Creek slope were observed and compared to the actual situation of the slope. The use of terrestrial photogrammetry through Adamtech software confirmed some of the qualitative data obtained from aerial interpretation and from field survey. The limited use of terrestrial photogrammetry was due to the impossibility of orienting the 3 D terrestrial models. Anyway these models were also useful to confirm one of the possible mechanisms used to describe the evolution of Blais Creek. Geomechanical analysis was performed through field work and laboratory tests to characterize the entire slope and to produce some of the values useful for a possible numerical analysis of Blais Creek. It showed interesting differences in geomechanical properties between the calc-silicate and quartzite/gneiss. The kinematic analysis showed very the different instability areas along the slope, even if variations in landforms and rock masses volume weren’t widespread along Blais Creek slope during the time span covered by aerial photographs (1973 - 2007). Indeed, the multitemporal analysis outlined very active instability along the large upper trench and the lateral active slopes of Blais Creek. Even without significant level of risks in the area, considering the remote area involved in this instability, some relevant hazards could occur, related to the possible collapse of SE side of Blais Creek DsGSD. Regarding the long term evolution of the DsGSD, the extensive network of linear features at Blais Creek is of a large deforming rock mass. Movement probably began with the retreat of valley glaciers during deglaciation when the oversteepened valley sides were debuttressed. By these evidences it is possible to theorize that the post-glacial retreat of the rock face and removal of the ice buttress from both the Seymour and the Blais Creeek Valleys lowered the factor of stability of the mass as a whole, allowing a deep-seated shear surface to develop gradually over time by progressive creep...|$|R
