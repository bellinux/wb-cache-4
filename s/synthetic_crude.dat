5|$|Shale oil {{extraction}} process decomposes oil shale and converts its kerogen into shale oila petroleum-like <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude</b> oil. The process is conducted by pyrolysis, hydrogenation, or thermal dissolution. The efficiencies of extraction processes are often evaluated by comparing their yields {{to the results}} of a Fischer Assay performed on a sample of the shale.|$|E
5|$|Oil shale {{has been}} used for {{industrial}} purposes since the early 17th century, when it was mined for its minerals. Since the late 19th century, shale oil has also been used for its oil content and as a low grade fuel for power generation. However, barring countries having significant oil shale deposits, its use for power generation is not particularly widespread. Similarly, oil shale is a source for production of <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude</b> oil and it is seen as a solution towards increasing domestic production of oil in countries that are reliant on imports.|$|E
25|$|In Alberta, five bitumen upgraders produce <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude</b> oil and {{a variety}} of other products: The Suncor Energy upgrader near Fort McMurray, Alberta {{produces}} <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude</b> oil plus diesel fuel; the Syncrude Canada, Canadian Natural Resources, and Nexen upgraders near Fort McMurray produce <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude</b> oil; and the Shell Scotford Upgrader near Edmonton produces <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude</b> oil plus an intermediate feedstock for the nearby Shell Oil Refinery. A sixth upgrader, under construction in 2015 near Redwater, Alberta, will upgrade half of its crude bitumen directly to diesel fuel, with the remainder of the output being sold as feedstock to nearby oil refineries and petrochemical plants.|$|E

40|$|Physical {{properties}} and chemical compositions of six <b>synthetic</b> <b>crudes</b> were determined. The results {{were compared to}} those of typical petroleum crudes, with the interest being the feasibility of making jet fuels from oil shale and coal syncrudes. The specific gravity, viscosity, and pour point were measured, showing that these crudes would be described as heavier rather than lighter crudes. The boiling range distribution of the crudes was determined by distillation and by gas chromatography. In addition, gel permeation chromatograms were obtained, giving a unique molecular weight distribution profile for each crude. Analyses for carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and sulfur concentrations were performed, {{as well as for}} hydrocarbon group type and trace element concentrations. It was found that the range in concentration of vanadium, an element whose presence in turbine fuels is of major concern, was lower than that of petroleum crudes. Sodium and potassium, other elements of concern, were present in comparatively high concentrations...|$|R
25|$|Upon {{reaching}} a refinery, the <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude</b> is processed {{and a significant}} portion of the upgrading agent will be removed during the refining process. It may be used for other fuel fractions, but the end result is that liquid fuel has to be piped to the upgrading facility simply to make the bitumen transportable by pipeline.

25|$|In the Canadian oil sands, bitumen {{produced}} by surface mining is generally upgraded on-site and delivered as <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude</b> oil. This makes delivery {{of oil to}} market through conventional oil pipelines quite easy. On the other hand, bitumen {{produced by}} the in-situ projects is generally not upgraded but delivered to market in raw form. If the agent used to upgrade the bitumen to <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude</b> is not produced on site, it must be sourced elsewhere and transported {{to the site of}} upgrading. If the upgraded crude is being transported from the site by pipeline, and additional pipeline will be required to bring in sufficient upgrading agent. The costs of production of the upgrading agent, the pipeline to transport it and the cost to operate the pipeline must be calculated into the production cost of the <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude.</b>|$|E

As composed by D-amino acids, C-terminal alcohol, and disulfide bond, octreotide can be only prepared using chemistry synthesis method, which increases difficulty of the traditional reversed-phase separation. In this paper, we report a very fast separation of octreotide from <b>synthetic</b> peptide <b>crude</b> mixtures on a poly(styrene co-divinylbenzene) (PSt) -based reversed phases prepared by a quick membrane emulsification process. In general, fourier-transformed infrared resonance (FT-IR) spectroscopy, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) combined with electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy are routinely used for analyses of resultant peptides. Under the optimized conditions, the octreotide is purified from 42. 89 % to 99. 99 %. Consequently, the poly(styrene co-divinylbenzene) -based phase can provide more flexibility to improve separation efficiency for the octreotide from the <b>synthetic</b> peptide <b>crude</b> mixtures.

40|$|A fuel quality {{processing}} {{study to}} provide a data base for an intelligent tradeoff between advanced turbine technology and liquid fuel quality, and also, to guide the development of specifications of future synthetic fuels anticipated {{for use in the}} time period 1985 to 2000 is given. Four technical performance tests are discussed: on-site pretreating, existing refineries to upgrade fuels, new refineries to upgrade fuels, and data evaluation. The base case refinery is a modern Midwest refinery processing 200, 000 BPD of a 60 / 40 domestic/import petroleum <b>crude</b> mix. The <b>synthetic</b> <b>crudes</b> used for upgrading to marketable products and turbine fuel are shale oil and coal liquids. Of these syncrudes, 50, 000 BPD are processed in the existing petroleum refinery, requiring additional process units and reducing petroleum feed, and in a new refinery designed for processing each syncrude to produce gasoline, distillate fuels, resid fuels, and turbine fuel, JPGs and coke. An extensive collection of synfuel properties and upgrading data was prepared for the application of a linear program model to investigate the most economical production slate meeting petroleum product specifications and turbine fuels of various quality grades. Technical and economic projections were developed for 36 scenarios, based on 4 different crude feeds to either modified existing or new refineries operated in 2 different modes to produce 7 differing grades of turbine fuels. A required product selling price of turbine fuel for each processing route was calculated. Procedures and projected economics were developed for on-site treatment of turbine fuel to meet limitations of impurities and emission of pollutants...|$|R
40|$|Gas-To-Liquid (GTL) Diesel fuel {{produced}} from <b>synthetic</b> <b>crudes</b> obtained from natural gas that is converted by the Fisher Tropsch (FT) {{technology is a}} promising key player for the mobility industry future along with conventional diesel fuels. The main distinctive properties that distinguish between GTL Diesel and conventional Diesel fuels include density, viscosity, lubricity and Cetane Index. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify the effect of the change in GTL Diesel?s composition and boiling range on its market specifications, then to develop predictive models for the GTL Diesel properties based on the fuel?s composition. The study recommends how the industry can use these data for upgrading the fuel quality based on distribution market demand. Intensive testing to analyze many characteristics for GTL Diesel was done at Texas A&M University at Qatar (TAMUQ), and ORYX GTL Company provided the GTL Diesel samples. The study was divided into two sections; the first section consisted of the experimental and modeling work where multiple GTL Diesel cuts were initially prepared. The properties of the prepared cuts were analyzed for five critical GTL Diesel fuel market specifications: Density, Viscosity (kinematic and dynamic), Flash point, Cetane index and Cold properties (Pour and Cloud points). In the second section, these properties were compared with the original market specifications in order to identify whether an improvement in fuel characteristics is obtained. In the third section, the properties of these fuel cuts are used to generate mathematical models for properties-compositions relationships. Finally, we proposed certain modifications to the existing GTL Plants that will improve the separation of specific quality of fuels and value-added chemicals cut. This study also identified the potentials for the light cuts obtained from GTL Diesel fuel to be used for the production of Linear Alkyl Benzene (LAB), which is considered as an expensive value-chemical and a feedstock to detergents manufacturing plants...|$|R
25|$|The {{first step}} in {{upgrading}} is vacuum distillation to separate the lighter fractions. After that, de-asphalting is used to separate the asphalt from the feedstock. Cracking is used to break the heavier hydrocarbon molecules down into simpler ones. Since cracking produces products which are rich in sulfur, desulfurization {{must be done to}} get the sulfur content below 0.5% and create sweet, light <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude</b> oil.|$|E
25|$|Heavy crude oil, {{which is}} much more viscous than {{conventional}} crude oil, and tar sands, where bitumen is found mixed with sand and clay, are becoming more important as sources of fossil fuel. Oil shale and similar materials are sedimentary rocks containing kerogen, a complex mixture of high-molecular weight organic compounds, which yield <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude</b> oil when heated (pyrolyzed). These materials have yet to be exploited commercially. These fuels can be employed in internal combustion engines, fossil fuel power stations and other uses.|$|E
25|$|When {{the first}} oil sands plants were built over 50 years ago, most oil {{refineries}} in their market area {{were designed to}} handle light or medium crude oil with lower sulfur content than the 4–7% that is typically found in bitumen. The original oil sands upgraders were designed to produce a high-quality <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude</b> oil (SCO) with lower density and lower sulfur content. These are large, expensive plants which are much like heavy oil refineries. Research is currently being done on designing simpler upgraders which do not produce SCO but simply treat the bitumen to reduce its viscosity, allowing to be transported unblended like conventional heavy oil.|$|E
40|$|The {{authors have}} {{examined}} effects of blending a raw coal extract (EXT) with an extracted coal-tar pitch (ECTP). Previous reports {{were concerned with}} the addition of 15 wt% EXT, or less, on the physical characteristics of the blend and on the development of optical texture following carbonization. Two additional blends of ECTP and EXT were prepared at the 30 and 50 wt% EXT content using a procedure already described. The characteristics of the blends are presented. The density for these blended materials is not much different than the density for the blends reported earlier. The softening point temperature for the 30 wt% EXT increased to over 200 C while the softening point temperature for the 50 wt% EXT blend was too high to be determined by the Mettler method. Coke yields approximately follow the law of mixtures. The optical texture of the green cokes for the 30 and 50 wt% EXT blends is shown. Though the optical texture of the green cokes was not significantly affected where the level of EXT is 15 wt% or less, larger proportions of EXT exert a marked reduction in anisotropy. The co-processing of coal with petroleum residues or other heavy hydrocarbons at elevated temperature and pressure has received considerable attention in the research community as a means to upgrade simultaneously coal and byproducts. Heavy hydrocarbons can function as sources of hydrogen, as well as performing as a medium for dissolution and dispersion of coal fragments. However, the focus of much of the prior research has been on developing fuels, distillable liquids, or <b>synthetic</b> <b>crudes.</b> Comparatively little effort has been deliberately directed toward the production of heavier, non-distillable materials which could perform as binder and extender pitches, impregnants, or feedstocks for cokes and other carbons...|$|R

25|$|Discontinuous sand bodies at {{the base}} of the McMurray Formation in the Athabasca Oil Sands region of northeastern Alberta, Canada, are {{commonly}} referred to as the Basal Water Sand (BWS) aquifers. Saturated with water, they are confined beneath impermeable bitumen-saturated sands that are exploited to recover bitumen for <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude</b> oil production. Where they are deep-lying and recharge occurs from underlying Devonian formations they are saline, and where they are shallow and recharged by meteoric water they are non-saline. The BWS typically pose problems for the recovery of bitumen, whether by open-pit mining or by in situ methods such as steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD), and in some areas they are targets for waste-water injection.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to transporting gas via pipelines {{for use in}} power generation, other end uses for natural gas include export as liquefied natural gas (LNG) or conversion of natural gas into other liquid products via gas to liquids (GTL) technologies. GTL technologies can convert natural gas into liquids products such as gasoline, diesel or jet fuel. A variety of GTL technologies have been developed, including Fischer–Tropsch (F–T), methanol to gasoline (MTG) and STG+. F–T produces a <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude</b> that can be further refined into finished products, while MTG can produce synthetic gasoline from natural gas. STG+ can produce drop-in gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and aromatic chemicals directly from natural gas via a single-loop process.

25|$|Modernized and new large {{refineries}} such as {{are found}} in the Midwestern United States and on the Gulf Coast of the United States, as well as many in China, can handle upgrading heavy oil themselves, so their demand is for non-upgraded bitumen and extra-heavy oil rather than SCO. The main problem is that the feedstock would be too viscous to flow through pipelines, so unless it is delivered by tanker or rail car, it must be blended with diluent to enable it to flow. This requires mixing the crude bitumen with a lighter hydrocarbon diluent such as condensate from gas wells, pentanes and other light products from oil refineries or gas plants, or <b>synthetic</b> <b>crude</b> oil from oil sands upgraders to allow it to flow through pipelines to market.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between the molecular size of lignin in several preparations and extent of degradation (mineralization) by Xanthomonas sp. strain 99. The influence of ligninase pretreatment was also examined. Five synthetic lignins and one 14 C-methylated spruce lignin were used. The extent of mineralization to 14 CO 2 was greatest for the samples containing the most low-molecular-weight material, and the low-molecular-weight portions were preferentially (or perhaps solely) degraded. Pretreatment of the five <b>synthetic</b> lignins with <b>crude</b> ligninase increased their molecular size and decreased their degradability by the xanthomonad. Pretreatment of the methylated spruce lignin with crude ligninase caused both polymerization and depolymerization but resulted in a net decrease in bacterial degradability.

40|$|Humins {{are solid}} {{by-products}} formed during the acid-catalysed conversions of C- 6 sugars to platform chemicals like hydroxymethylfurfural and levulinic acid. We here report an experimental {{study on the}} liquefaction/depolymerisation of humins using catalytic pyrolysis. Synthetic humins (SH) and crude industrial humins (CIH, including purified industrial (PIH) samples) from the acid-catalysed conversion of C- 6 sugars to HMF/LA were tested. Thermal degradation patterns of both humin types vary significantly. Major thermal decomposition of the industrial humins was observed between 50 and 650 C (weight loss approx. 66 wt%), whereas, major weight loss was observed between 200 and 800 C for the synthetic humins (47 wt%). A series of catalytic pyrolysis tests with synthetic humins and different zeolites were performed using a PTV-GC/MS (humin to catalyst wt ratio of 0. 2, 550 C). Best results were obtained using HZSM- 5 (SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 = 50). For quantitative analysis, a gram scale pyrolysis unit was used, giving a product oil (9 - 11 wt% on humin intake) with approximately 1. 5 and 10 wt% aromatics from <b>synthetic</b> and <b>crude</b> industrial humins, respectively.

25|$|The Canadian Energy Research Institute (CERI) {{performed}} an analysis, estimating that in 2012 the average plant gate costs (including 10% profit margin, but excluding blending and transport) of primary recovery was $30.32/bbl, of SAGD was $47.57/bbl, of mining and upgrading was $99.02/bbl, and of mining without upgrading was $68.30/bbl. Thus, {{all types of}} oil sands projects except new mining projects with integrated upgraders {{were expected to be}} consistently profitable from 2011 onward, provided that global oil prices remained favourable.

A particular therapeutic focus for synthetic peptides is cancer treatment. 1, 2 In order {{to keep pace with the}} growing number of newly synthesized peptides, peptide purification should not represent the bottleneck in the drug discovery process. Since the target masses of synthetic peptides are well known, mass-based fraction collection represents an efficient technique for their purification. In contrast to fraction triggering with less specific detectors, employing a mass selective detector leads in each run only to the purification of the target mass.

40|$|This report investigates how the {{technique}} of small angle neutron scattering (SANS) helps elucidate the phenomenon of wax deposition in a petroleum crude oil. Specifically, we report SANS data, supplemented by results from dynamic light scattering (DLS), obtained from a <b>synthetic</b> petroleum <b>crude</b> oil: a mixture of commercial paraffin wax dissolved in an octane/cyclohexane solvent. The system is a gel below the cloud point. The onset and growth of this waxy gel, and changes in its nanostructure, are recorded here {{as a function of}} temperature over the range 10 ≤ T/°C ≤ 65. SANS indicates that the wax has a definite characteristic length of about 100 Å (10 nm) which can be observed at temperatures as high as 57 °C, but DLS indicates that the wax also contains very large structures - of the order of a micrometer - over the temperature range 30 ° - 50 °C. The structural studies are supplemented by corresponding sets of viscosity and stress data taken from the gelling wax when subjected to an applied shear. We observe that the stress will increase as the temperature falls - i. e. as the system gels - but, in general, will then reach a maximum and tend to decline. The wax results are compared with those from an equivalent system consisting of a major component of the wax: n-docosane, C 22. Significant differences between the behavior of the wax and the pure component in the solvents are noted. The SANS patterns to 20 °C from docosane do not give any indication of the nanoscale structure observed from the wax; the DLS patterns for docosane indicate that a solidification occurs over a very narrow temperature range between 10 °C and 12 °C, accompanied by a dramatic slowing of the dynamics; the large scale structure seen in the wax mixtures is not evident; and the rheological behavior of the two systems is markedly different. The paper also compares and contrasts the rheological behavior of the wax gel with that observed from defined system, gelled colloidal silica. Strong similarities are apparent...|$|R
