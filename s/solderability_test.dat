40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} dipping {{time to the}} {{intermetallic}} compound and free solder thickness of Sn-Cu-Ni (SN 100 C) lead-free solder has been investigated. Dipping of copper strips in molten solder was carried out using GEN 3 <b>solderability</b> <b>test</b> machine with 20 s, 60 s, 120 s, 180 s, and 240 s of dipping time. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was used to observe the solder coating on the copper strips. Thickness of IMC, free solder and total solder coating was calculated. The influence of dipping time was established. The results indicated that longer dipping time produced high IMC thickness while the free solder thickness reduced {{with the growth of}} IMC. <b>Solderability</b> <b>test</b> was also conducted to know the wettability of SN 100 C coating for the lowest dipping time which had resulted in 1. 571 s of wetting time and 4. 066 mN of maximum force...|$|E
40|$|A new <b>solderability</b> <b>test</b> {{method has}} been {{developed}} at Sandia National Laboratories that simulates the capillary flow physics of solders on circuit board surfaces. The <b>solderability</b> <b>test</b> geometry was incorporated on a circuit board prototype that was developed for a National Center for Manufacturing Sciences (NCMS) program. The work was conducted under a cooperative research and development agreement between Sandia National Laboratories, NCMS, and several PWB fabricators (AT&T, IBM, Texas Instruments, United Technologies/Hamilton Standard and Hughes Aircraft) to advance PWB interconnect technology. The {{test was used to}} investigate the effects of environmental prestressing on the solderability of printed wiring board (PWB) copper finishes. Aging was performed in a controlled chamber representing a typical indoor industrial environment. Solderability testing on as-fabricated and exposed copper samples was performed with the Sn-Pb eutectic solder at four different reflow temperatures (215, 230, 245 and 260 {degrees}C). Rosin mildly activated (RMA), low solids (LS), and citric acid-based (CA) fluxes were included in the evaluation. Under baseline conditions, capillary flow was minimal at the lowest temperatures with all fluxes. Wetting increased with temperature at both baseline and prestressing conditions. Poor wetting, however, was observed at all temperatures with the LS flux. Capillary flow is effectively restored with the CA flux...|$|E

40|$|The article {{presents}} the results of <b>solderability</b> <b>testing</b> of printed circuit boards. The aim {{of this paper is to}} compare different atmospheres for <b>solderability</b> <b>testing</b> with different finishes of printed circuit boards (PCB’s). The article contains method descriptions that were used for <b>solderability</b> <b>testing</b> of printed circuit boards. The method of wetting balance test was chosen for this experiment. The PCB can be made with several kinds of surface finishing. Copper is the most commonly used material in the manufacture of printed circuit boards. The negative copper property is its low chemical stability. When a contact is in an atmosphere that contains oxygen, the surface is covered with a layer of copper oxides. This layer deteriorates copper solderability. Another way how to prevent oxidation of copper soldering pads of printed circuit boards is an inert atmosphere. As an inert atmosphere does not contain oxygen and prevents oxidation of the material used on PCB’s. The increasingly frequent introduction of inert atmospheres into soldering processes encourages the introduction of a inert atmosphere also in <b>solderability</b> <b>testing</b> processes...|$|R

In 1998, <b>solderability</b> <b>test</b> results were published on Ni/Pd-finished components using a Sn/Ag/Cu/Sb lead-free (Pb-free) solder paste and printed wiring board (PWB) pads coated with organic solderability preservative (OSP).

40|$|This {{article will}} present results of {{activity}} testing of rosin fluxes. A good solderability of a component output and a soldering pad of PCB {{are important for}} the creation of a quality joint. Since it supports a melted solder wetting on a soldered surface, a flux has a definitive influence on the creation of a quality joint. Further, it removes oxides and other impurities from soldering alloys and prevents from a creation of a new oxide layer during soldering. According the technology of a solder joint creation, a flux is added into the soldering process in different ways. The aim of the test was to select a rosin flux having with the solder tube the best results during soldering of the copper surface on PCB's. Fluxes were compared by the help of two different tests.

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} the performance, the crystal microstructure, and defects of Au/Pd/Ni/Cu {{preplated}} lead frames (PPF). The wire pull test, the <b>solderability</b> <b>test,</b> and high-resolution {{transmission electron microscopy}} (HRTEM) are employed to characterize the PPFs {{in order to understand}} the relationship between performance and microstructure. The electroplated PPFs are composed of Au (3 nm) /Pd (5 to 15 nm) /Ni (0. 7 mu m) /Cu substrate. We optimize the electroplating profile and determine the minimum thickness of the Pd layer with the PPF performance satisfying the industry standards. Further increasing the Pd layer thickness beyond the critical thickness will not enhance the performance more, but increase the product cost. With the optimized electroplating profile, the electroplated Au layer is epitaxially deposited on the I'd layer, and so does the Pd layer on the Ni layer. The interface between the Au and Pd layers is in general coherent in spite of the about 4. 8 % mismatch strain between the An and Pd lattices because the Au layer thickness is only 3 nm small.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the effect of nitrogen and air atmospheres on the solderability testing of plasma-treated hot air solder level (HASL) finish printed circuit boards (PCBs). Design/methodology/approach – In this paper, the soldering performance of plasma-treated HASL finish PCBs in nitrogen and air atmospheres have been evaluated using the wetting balance technique. The results were compared with the performance of conventionally flux-treated samples soldered in air and nitrogen atmospheres and non-flux treated samples soldered in air. Auger chemical analysis results were also compared with the <b>solderability</b> <b>test</b> results in order to obtain a complete profile of the plasma-treated and non-treated surfaces. Findings – The results of the auger chemical analysis show high organic (carbon) levels in the control samples and a significant drop in organic levels in the plasma-treated samples. The significant drop in the level of carbon leads to a decrease in contact angle and an increase in both surface energy and solder wettability. The results indicate that plasma cleaning of PCBs prior to soldering is a viable alternative to the conventional use of flux.

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve a {{reduction}} in solderability related defects on electronic components and Printed Circuit Board’s (PCB’s) in electronics manufacturing, preventive controls such as “Dip & Look” and “Wetting Balance” solderability testing need to be fully optimised to screen out all poor soldering components and PCB’s. Components and PCB’s that pass these tests should solder correctly in volume production. This thesis initially investigates the variations and effects of the Dip & Look <b>solderability</b> <b>test</b> on components and PCB’s. Data from this analysis proved {{that no matter how}} extreme the oxidisation on the component termination or PCB pad, the visual inspection criteria of 95 % solder coverage is achieved each time. Dip & Look testing therefore serves no useful purpose to the electronics mass manufacturer in determining the solderability of a component or PCB. The second option available to screen components is the Wetting Balance Test. Due to the variation of parameter settings within the international standards for solder temperature, immersion speed, immersion depth, removal speed and dwell time, a complete analysis was required to determine the optimum settings for the MUST II Wetting Balance machine that would detect poor soldering components. The test specifications vary considerably between all the international standards. Design of Experiments conducted an in-depth analysis to determine the optimum Wetting Balance test settings using the range of test specifications stated within the standards. Within the range of specifications the least stringent and most stringent settings were developed which highlighted the difference in results when testing at the lower end and higher end of the current international standards. Prediction models were generated for each of the responses (Ta, Tb, Fmax, TFmax, F 1 and F 2) using Wetting Balance machine parameters solder temperature, immersion speed and immersion depth. To test these models, components with a history of solderability issues were tested and evaluated using the least stringent and most stringent settings. XRF measurements were conducted to ensure uniform plating thickness. Both components passed the Wetting Balance test criteria generated by the model equations using the least stringent settings but failed when using the most stringent settings. The current industrial specification for Ta (< 0. 6 seconds) and Tb (< 1 second) were also achieved on both components even though the components had known soldering issues on a series production line. It was proven that there was a 40 % difference in the Ta and Tb values when testing {{at the lower end of}} the international specification as opposed to testing at the higher end of the specification, which questioned the spread on the tolerance of the parameter settings within the current international standards. It was established through experimentation that the current F 1 criteria, which states no less than 50 % of Fmax, must be reviewed based on the analysis carried out in this thesis. To ensure completeness a component with no soldering issues was also tested using the same procedure. This component passed the Wetting Balance test using the least stringent and most stringent settings illustrating that the settings derived through this research are robust to detect good and poor soldering components. This research has developed an alternative set of Wetting Balance test specifications and has defined new model equations that will predict the Wetting Balance responses such as Ta, Tb, Fmax, TFmax, F 1 and F 2, which will result in components which are deemed acceptable under international and industrial standards...|$|E
40|$|Lead-free {{soldering}} {{technology is}} still in its infancy with technical and cost issues posing major challenges for the industry. It is expected that soldering in a nitrogen atmosphere might overcome some of the technical barriers and provide soldered products comparable to those using conventional lead-containing materials processed in air. But quantitative data regarding the soldering behaviour of lead-free solders under various atmospheres are sparse. As part of an ongoing study on the effects of inerting on the solderability of lead-free alloys an examination has been made of the solderability, as measured in a wetting balance, of three common board finishes using a 95. 5 / 3. 8 / 0. 7 SnAgCu solder. The board finishes used were ENIG, HASL, immersion silver and a copper OSP. To simulate typical lead-free soldering cycles the samples were subjected to multiple temperature cycles in a convection reflow oven before <b>solderability</b> <b>testing</b> using a Multicore MUST II tester. A peak reflow temperature of 250 °C and an R flux was used for the ENIG and Ag finishes. The OSP finish performed poorly under these conditions and OSP testing was done using a 235 °C peak temperature and a 0. 5 % activated R flux. During testing the atmospheres were controlled at levels of oxygen of 21 % (air), 10, 000, 1000 and 100 ppm. Although inerting improved the solderability of all three finishes, there were differences between the individual alloys.

Owing to the temperature-sensitivity of the solar cell structure, potential routes of low temperature interconnection methods for PV module integration are assessed. Textured wafers with a full area 2 μm PVD-Al metallization are divided into two groups: The first is capped with sputtered 100 nm Ti and 400 nm Ag for <b>testing</b> <b>solderability.</b> The second is capped with 400 nm Ag for electrically conductive adhesive (ECA) interconnection. Low temperature soldering with Sn 43 Bi 57 and Sn 41 Bi 57 Ag 2 coated ribbons and ribbon interconnection with two ECAs are evaluated in terms of peel strength, contact resistivity and accelerated aging properties. It is found that peel strength of soldered interconnections on the Al/Ti/Ag achieve between 1. 5 N mm- 1 to 2 N mm- 1 whereas glued interconnections on Al/Ag between 0. 5 N mm- 1 to 1 N mm- 1.

40|$|Au/Pd/Ni {{pre-plated}} leadframes (PPF) {{are high}} performance frames for accommodating high-end electronic packages. Cost and reliability are major concerns in their wide application. The present work, from a materials science point view, deepens {{the understanding of}} PPFs, optimizes the conventional PPFs, develops a novel PPF architecture and models the residual stress relaxation in heteroepitaxial thin films. The wire pull test, the <b>solderability</b> <b>test,</b> and High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) were employed to characterize the PPFs {{in order to understand}} the relationship between performance and microstructure. We optimized the electroplating profiles and determined the minimum thickness of the Pd layer with the PPF performance satisfying the industry standards. Further increasing the Pd layer thickness beyond the critical thickness will not enhance the performance more, but increase the product cost. With the optimized electroplating profile, the electroplated Au layer is epitaxially deposited on the Pd layer, and so does the Pd layer on the Ni layer. Misfit dislocations and nanotwins are present at the interface between the Pd and Ni layers, which are generated to release the about 10. 4 % misfit strain between the Pd and Ni lattices. This work demonstrates that the electro-deposition technique can electroplate epitaxy-like Pd films on the highly (200) textured Ni films, which are grown on the Cu substrates. A novel technique for impeding Cu out-diffusion in Cu alloy based pre-plated leadframes was developed by electroplating a 3 - 4 nm thick Sn layer on a Cu alloy base prior to electroplating a Ni layer. A 10 - 14 nm thick epitaxy-like and dense (Cu,Ni) 3 Sn intermetallic compound (IMC) layer is automatically formed en route of diffuse reaction, which leads to a drastic reduction in Cu out-diffusion and hence improves significantly the protection of the leadframes against oxidation and corrosion attack. The oxidation behaviours were quantified by Electron Diffraction X-ray (EDX) incorporated in Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) in the present work, which is a good complementary to the traditional weight gain test by a balance. A diffusion/oxidation model was developed to estimate the effective diffusion coefficient of Cu in the formed IMC nanolayers. The estimated Cu diffusion coefficient in the IMC interlayer is about 1. 6 x 10 - 22 m 2 / s at 250 °C, which is around 7 ~ 11 orders lower than the interdiffusion coefficients for η-Cu 6 Sn 5 and ε-Cu 3 Sn phases at corresponding temperatures. Based on the dislocation theory of twinning, analytical solutions by using the hybrid superposition and Fourier transformation approach were derived for the calculation of various energies involved in the misfit twinning process. For a given epilayer thickness and lattice mismatch strain, the twin formation energy should reach its minimum to determine the twin width and a zero minimum formation energy determines the critical thickness for misfit twinning. The effect of elastic mismatch between the epilayer and the substrate on the critical thickness was studied comprehensively, revealing that an elastically soft epilayer has a large critical thickness. Moreover, a misfit-twin-and-perfect-dislocation predominance chart is constructed to predict the predominant regions of misfit twinning and perfect dislocation in the mismatch strain and the specific twin boundary energy domain. Multiple misfit twins in epilayer/substrate systems were studied by summing up the stress and displacement fields of individual twins. In principle, the energy minimization approach can be applied to multiple misfit twins, although only periodic arrays of parallel and alternating twins were investigated here in detail. The equilibrium twin width and equilibrium twin spacing of a periodic array of twins represent the misfit twin morphology. The theoretical results indicate that the difference in elastic constants between an epilayer and its substrate has great effects on the morphology of equilibrium twins. The theoretical predictions agree with experimental observations...|$|E
