25|$|A <b>Single</b> <b>Audit</b> {{encompasses}} {{an examination}} of a recipient’s financial records, financial statements, federal award transactions and expenditures, the general management of its operations, internal control systems, and federal assistance it received during the audit period (the time period of recipient operations examined in the <b>Single</b> <b>Audit,</b> which is usually covers a natural or fiscal year). The <b>Single</b> <b>Audit</b> {{is divided into two}} areas: Compliance and Financial.|$|E
25|$|The {{compliance}} {{component of}} a <b>Single</b> <b>Audit</b> covers the study and understanding (planning stage) {{as well as the}} testing and evaluation (exam stage) of the recipient with respect to federal assistance usage, operations and compliance with laws and regulations. The financial component is exactly like a financial audit of a non-federal entity which includes the audit of the financial statements and accompanying notes. Depending on the recipient, the <b>Single</b> <b>Audit</b> can be simple and straightforward, or it could be complex and troublesome. This is because there are millions of federal grants awarded each year to thousands of recipients, each with its own independent way of operating. Therefore, the <b>Single</b> <b>Audit</b> differs from recipient to recipient and from federal program to program.|$|E
25|$|Before {{implementing}} the <b>Single</b> <b>Audit,</b> {{the federal government}} relied on numerous audits carried out on individual federally funded programs to ensure these funds were spent properly. Because the government had numerous agencies awarding hundreds of different programs, the task of auditing all programs became increasingly difficult and time consuming. To improve this situation, the <b>Single</b> <b>Audit</b> Act of 1984 standardized audit requirements for States, local governments, and Indian tribal governments that receive and use federal financial assistance programs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In Cloud Computing Public {{auditing}} on {{the integrity}} of shared data is very big issue, because the public auditing scheme will predictably reveal confidential information, and identity privacy to public verifiers. This survey, propose a new scheme called a novel privacy-preserving mechanism which supports public auditing on shared data stored in the cloud. In particular, this scheme takes advantage of ring signatures to compute verification metadata. The ring signature scheme is needed to audit the correctness of shared data. With this mechanism, {{the identity of the}} signer on each block in shared data is kept secret or private from public verifiers. Public verifiers are one who are able to efficiently verify shared data integrity without retrieving the entire file. In addition, this mechanism is able to perform multiple auditing tasks simultaneously instead of <b>single</b> <b>auditing</b> task. This survey shows the effectiveness and efficiency of our mechanism when auditing shared data integrity. Key Words—Public auditing, privacy-preserving, shared data, cloud computin...|$|R

25|$|As {{part of the}} <b>Single</b> <b>Audit,</b> {{the auditor}} must prepare and submit three {{individual}} reports to the recipient and to the federal government. The first report is an opinion, or a disclaimer thereof, on whether the recipient’s financial statements are presented in conformity with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, identical to a financial audit’s report on a non-recipient entity. The second report is {{about the status of}} internal controls relative to the financial statements and major programs. The third report is an opinion, or a disclaimer thereof, on {{the degree to which the}} recipient has complied with laws, regulations, and the terms and conditions of the federal assistance awards. Following the last two reports, if the <b>Single</b> <b>Audit</b> produced audit findings, the auditor must prepare the Schedule of Findings and Questioned Costs discussed earlier.|$|E
25|$|The auditor must {{understand}} the recipient’s internal control system {{to determine if the}} recipient has proper safeguards that help manage federal assistance responsibly. After obtaining sufficient knowledge of that system, the auditor must perform audit procedures to verify the recipient’s internal control system works properly, and the recipient’s federal program operations comply with laws and regulations (e.g., the compliance audit portion of the <b>Single</b> <b>Audit).</b>|$|E

Although the actual work necessary for a <b>Single</b> <b>Audit</b> is established by the auditor, the OMB has set a limit for auditing high-risk and low-risk recipients. For high-risk recipients, the auditor is required to audit not less than 40% of all the federal assistance received during the year. For low-risk recipients, that limit is decreased to 20%.|$|E
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of a large-scale accounting fraud, China implemented a dual audit system for listed companies issuing foreign stocks (B shares and H shares) from 2001 to 2006, before adopting Chinese-IFRS in 2007. At the end of 2010, the EU proposed that listed corporations over a certain size {{should be required to}} implement a joint audit system. However, only a few countries have implemented this system, and thus, data and references are extremely limited. The dual audit system is called the “twin” of the joint audit system. We analyze whether the dual system improves a company’s earnings quality. Earnings quality is studied by means of real earnings management, and the variable of loss aversion. We find that real earnings management of dual audited enterprises is lower than that of <b>single</b> <b>audited</b> (A-share) enterprises, and the inclination toward loss aversion of enterprises in the foreign share market has not increased significantly relative to the A-share enterprises after the abolition of the dual audit system. The results indicate that a dual audit system improves earnings quality. We expect that the conclusions of this research will resolve the issues and concerns about the joint audit system...|$|R

A <b>single</b> contract <b>audit</b> manual was issued on June 18, 1952, serving the three military service branches existing at that time.

25|$|The auditor is {{responsible}} for conducting the actual audit of the recipient in accordance with Generally Accepted Government Auditing Standards (GAGAS) and using the guidance provided by the OMB Circular A-133 and its Compliance Supplement, all of which establish certain rules to follow during the <b>Single</b> <b>Audit.</b> The auditor must establish audit objectives that determine whether the recipient complied with laws and regulations. They must research the recipient’s federal assistance awards and programs to determine applicability of specific laws and regulations. They must understand the recipient, its organization, operations, internal control systems, and ability to responsibly manage federal assistance. They must perform audit procedures (some of which are suggested by the Compliance Supplement) to meet these audit objectives.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, the <b>Single</b> <b>Audit,</b> {{also known}} as the OMB A-133 audit, is a rigorous, organization-wide audit or {{examination}} of an entity that expends $750,000 or more of Federal assistance (commonly known as Federal funds, Federal grants, or Federal awards) received for its operations. Usually performed annually, the Single Audit’s objective is to provide assurance to the US federal government as to the management and use of such funds by recipients such as states, cities, universities, and non-profit organizations. The audit is typically performed by an independent certified public accountant (CPA) and encompasses both financial and compliance components. The Single Audits must be submitted to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse along with a data collection form, Form SF-SAC.|$|E
25|$|This {{determination}} {{affects the}} entire <b>Single</b> <b>Audit</b> because the auditor adjusts the examination accordingly. Since the auditor must provide an opinion {{to the federal}} government on whether the recipient and its programs complied with laws and regulations, the auditor performs sufficient tests and audit procedures (also known as audit work) to confirm the opinion is correct. Normally, the auditor greatly increases the amount of auditing for high-risk auditees, to ensure their opinion is correct. For low-risk auditees, the auditor is not as rigorous; but still recognizes that a low-risk recipient may still have compliance issues. Conversely, a high-risk determination doesn't mean the recipient is non-compliant, just that they're more likely to be.|$|E

25|$|The federal {{government}} provides an extensive array of federal assistance to recipients reaching over $400 billion annually. This assistance is provided through thousands of individual grants and awards {{annually for the}} purpose of benefiting the general public in the areas of education, health, public safety, welfare, and public works, among others. However, as a condition of receiving this assistance recipients must comply with applicable federal and state laws and regulations, as well as any particular provisions tied with the specific assistance. The <b>Single</b> <b>Audit</b> provides the Federal government with assurance that these recipients comply with such directives by having an independent external source (the CPA) report on such compliance. However, it only applies to state, local government, and nonprofit recipients that expend $750,000 or more of such assistance in one year.|$|E
500|$|To {{facilitate}} a recipients' compliance with federal laws and regulations, {{and as well}} as its annual <b>Single</b> <b>Audit,</b> the OMB created fourteen basic and standard compliance requirements that recipients must comply with when receiving and using such federal assistance. The OMB also provides detailed explanations, discussions, and guidance about them in the OMB A-133 Compliance Supplement. Compliance requirements are only guidelines for compliance with the hundreds of laws and regulations applicable to the specific type assistance used by the recipient, and their objectives are generic in nature due to the large number of federal programs. 1-2 [...] Each compliance requirement is identified by a letter, in alphabetical order.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] is a {{large and}} {{extensive}} guide created by the OMB for Single Audits, and is considered the most important tool of both the auditor and the recipient when performing, or being subject to, a <b>Single</b> <b>Audit.</b> It was created following amendments in 1996 to the <b>Single</b> <b>Audit</b> Act and serves to identify existing important compliance requirements that the Federal Government expects to be considered {{as part of a}} <b>Single</b> <b>Audit.</b> Without it, auditors would need to research thousands of laws and regulations for each single program of a recipient to determine which compliance requirements are important to the Federal Government. For Single Audits, the Supplement replaces any agency audit guides and other audit requirement documents for individual Federal programs.|$|E
