500|$|Millburn is a biologist. Spall {{auditioned for}} another role, but Scott {{wanted him to}} play Millburn. On his casting, Spall said [...] "Alien {{is one of the}} best films ever made, and it's a real buzz to be in a space suit on an Alien set with Ridley Scott coming and <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> It's incredible. That's why I wanted to be an actor, to be in a space suit on an Alien set".|$|E
500|$|As audio director, Klepacki {{also created}} many sound effects for Universe at War. For the alien Hierarchy, he {{cultivated}} an [...] "unnatural" [...] aesthetic through an [...] "arsenal of mangled noises". Klepacki used a [...] "combination of heavy cranes recorded with overdriven impacts" [...] {{to give the}} faction's walkers a [...] "menacing machinelike breathing sound", and made up his own language to record [...] "various grunts, growls, mannerisms, and strange vocalizations. Since Hierarchy heroes needed to communicate to the player in English, Klepacki engineered dialogue to seem as if the aliens were [...] "telepathically <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> with a back-masking effect on their voices...as if the words are being channeled straight to your brain". The Novus effects were usually phased and involved [...] "mechanical movement, electricity, and metal sounds". He invented yet another language for two characters Viktor and Mirabel, who occasionally speak to one another. Lastly, he drew on weather and other natural sounds for the Masari, describing their ambience as having [...] "more weight, thunder, heavy bass rumblings, vortex gusts..." [...] Klepacki directed the voice-acting to have a [...] "noble and strong" [...] feel without appearing typically medieval or overly dramatic. He ultimately felt he did the work of [...] "three people" [...] with Universe at War, as the game's audio requirements changed constantly, requiring vigilance and programmer support. Divine Intervention was later nominated for a Game Audio Network Guild award, and the soundtrack was released as a free download after Petroglyph's efforts toward a traditional release were frustrated.|$|E
500|$|Kat George of VH1 gave a {{positive}} review for the album, describing the scenes as [...] "moving, inspirational and infectious" [...] while also calling them [...] "immaculately produced." [...] She further wrote that [...] "Tight and succinct, there's no filler in the Live At Roseland DVD — it's high {{energy from the}} beginning to the end, and doesn't {{give you a chance to}} lag or lose interest." [...] George went on to describe the album as [...] "intimate", which according to her gives [...] "the magic of Beyoncé — even when she's speaking to the masses, she's really <b>speaking</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> and you alone." [...] She finished her review saying that the album gives a personal evening with Beyoncé along with [...] "absolute grace and ultimate humility." [...] Sian-Pierre Regis of MTV described the album as a [...] "glitzy doc-style flick" [...] and noted that Beyoncé shows her [...] "softer" [...] side while also calling her a [...] "gift that keeps on giving." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Melissa Maerz wrote that [...] "According to... DVD Live at Roseland: Elements of 4... finds Beyoncé telling her life story through her songs... has done a whole lot of amazing things in her life." [...] Gordon Smart of The Sun praised the romance between Beyoncé and Jay-Z during the DVD, noting that it was interesting to see Beyoncé talking about her love life because she has always kept her private life in secret. J. J. Anisiobi and Donna Mcconnell of Daily Mail praised the fact that the DVD shows Beyoncé [...] "from eager five-year-old music fan to a consummate entertainer".|$|E
