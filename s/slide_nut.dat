5000|$|Other {{applications}} use a knuckle thread's rounded {{edges to}} reduce the stress on softer materials at a point of connection. Some linear actuators use a knuckle thread {{to reduce the}} wear of the steel leadscrew against a plastic <b>sliding</b> <b>nut.</b> Firefighting respirator standard EN 148-1 [...] "Respiratory protective devices - Threads for facepieces" [...] lists a knuckle thread to connect metal and rubber parts.|$|R
40|$|A screw {{threaded}} nut (1) comprises two interconnected halves (1 A, 1 B) moveable {{with respect to}} each other from an open position (figure 1) to a closed position (figure 2). In the open condition a screw threaded member (8) can be moved inside the nut (1) without turning. In figure 1, the <b>sliding</b> <b>nut</b> halves (1 A, 1 B) are closed by the action of a cam (6) on half 1 B. In figure 7, the pivoted nut halves (1 A, 1 B) are closed by engaging the end (15) of a lever (14) in a recess in the half 1 B. Further possible improvements include a detachable handle (7) and a means for locking the nut (1) and the cam (6) in the closed position...|$|R
50|$|A {{standard}} fitting can {{be installed}} using an ordinary wrench to tighten the surrounding nut. To remove it, a specialized puller {{is often used to}} <b>slide</b> the <b>nut</b> and ferrule off the tube. If the ferrule is difficult to remove it can be weakened with a cut, care being taken to not nick the pipe while cutting.|$|R

Their routine {{involves}} them slipping and <b>sliding</b> on <b>nuts</b> scattered on the floor. The Slipnutz also appeared on the program to promote their greatest-hits album, which included the songs [...] "Old West Cowboys Slipping on Nuts" [...] and [...] "Viking Raiders Slipping on Nuts".|$|R
50|$|A T-slot nut is {{used with}} a {{threaded}} clamp to position and secure pieces being worked on in a workshop. The T-slot <b>nut</b> <b>slides</b> along a T-slot track, which is set in workbench or table for a router, drill press, or bandsaw. T-slot nuts are also used with extruded aluminum framing, such as 80/20, to build a variety of industrial structures and machines.|$|R
40|$|The Department of Production and Industrial Administration of The College of Aeronautics {{has made}} a {{detailed}} analysis into the performance of numerically controlled machine tools, and this shows that when these machines are operating under light cutting loads, the total envelope tolerance is about 0. 003 ins. Further investigation into {{the source of the}} errors showed that about 80 per cent of this error was due to mechanical mechanisms in the machine tool. The electronic equipment operated inside a total band of 0. 0004 ins. over small distances, and 0. 0006 ins. over 10 inches. This situation appeared to justify a comprehensive survey into the methods which may be used to improve the mechanical performance of these machines. After due consideration had been given to a number of possible alternatives, it was decided to fit hydrostatic lubrication to the <b>slides,</b> <b>nut</b> and screw arrangement, and the thrust bearings used on the X and Y axes of an existing No. 3 Archdale Milling Machine. The Z axis {{was not included in the}} redesign, because analysis showed that a new head casting would have been necessary. It was thought that this additional expense was not justified and that the data obtained from an examination of the performance given by the X and Y axes would show whether the system could be used with advantage in the design of new machines. The paper gives details of the calculations used to establish the dimensions of the new features fitted to the machine to satisfy the target performance conditions which appeared to be possible and are given in the introduction. The authors would like to express their appreciation to James Archdale and Co. for making a machine available for this investigation, to the Staveley Research Department, and in particular to Mr. Graham, Mr. Harris, Mr. Huntley) M r. Cummings and Mr. Hayward...|$|R
50|$|The Type 97 is {{approximately}} 120 lb {{lighter than the}} Type 94 90-mm mortar. This weight saving was created largely by {{the elimination of the}} Type 94's recoil mechanism, which weighed 110 lb. The bipod assembly of the Type 97 is 14 lb lighter than that on the Type 94. There is a cover for the level on the yoke of the Type 97 which is not on the Type 94, and the sliding bracket of the Type 97 is hinged to permit its easy removal from the leg of the bipod, whereas it is integral on the Type 94.Certain compromises in material and workmanship were made in the manufacture of the Type 97. The bipod feet and chain hooks were held to the legs of the bipod by pins, joined with solder, whereas on the Type 94 they are welded. No welds were polished on the Type 97, although no indications of fractures were reported despite the poor quality of the welding. The adjusting <b>nut,</b> <b>sliding</b> bracket, and hand wheels of the Type 97 are made of steel, rather than brass which was utilized in the Type 94.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the design of}} Mini CNC Machine. This machine has 2 axes, namely the Xand Y axis. Mini CNC machine is a small CNC machine that can operate like a normal CNC machine with a limited area of the machining. The objectives of this project are to develop the mini CNC Machine and to develop the software to control the machine. This thesis describes {{the development of the}} machine and the criteria needed to build the machine. The Mini CNC Machine is initially sketched by referring to the criteria that was decided. The criteria are the travel path length, type of linear motion, type of linear drive, motor and controller, and type of material that used. This machineâ€™s travel on the X axis is 15 cm and Y axis is 15 cm. The linear motion was used is a round linear rail and the linear drive used was a <b>sliding</b> element, lead <b>nuts</b> and lead screws. The motor used is a stepper motor with specification 2. 1 V and 3. 0 A. The frame material used is aluminium. This material is used because it is light in weight, easy to handle and machine and it is rust proof. The design was sketched using SolidWork software. For the next step is developing the wiring for motor and develop the program to control the stepper motor. The ULN 2803 is used to convert the signal from parallel port to specific winding energizing sequences to step the motor. The Visual Basic software is used to program the motor movement...|$|R
