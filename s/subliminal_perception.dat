40|$|International audienceHow {{internal}} categories {{influence how}} we perceive {{the world is}} a fundamental question in cognitive sciences. Yet, the relation between perceptual awareness and perceptual categorization has remained largely uncovered so far. Here, we addressed this question by focusing on face <b>perception</b> during <b>subliminal</b> and conscious <b>perception.</b> We used morphed continua between two face identities and we assessed, through a masked priming paradigm, the perceptual processing of these morphed faces under subliminal and supraliminal conditions. We found that priming from subliminal faces followed linearly the information present in the primes, while priming from visible faces revealed a non-linear profile, indicating a categorical processing of face identities. Our results thus point to a special relation between perceptual awareness and categorical processing of faces, and support the dissociation between two modes of information processing: a subliminal mode involving analog treatment of stimuli information, and a supraliminal mode relying on discrete representation...|$|R
40|$|Following G. T.

With the advent of the theory of signal detection, however, discrete-state theory and the corresponding notion of threshold have been discounted. Consequently, phenomena such as <b>subliminal</b> priming and <b>perception</b> have a reduced theoretical basis. The authors propose a process-neutral definition of threshold that allows for graded perception and activation throughout the system. Thresholds correspond to maximum stimulus intensities such that the distribution of mental states does not differ from that when an appropriate baseline stimulus is presented. In practice, thresholds are maximum intensities such that the probability distribution on behavioral events does not differ from that from baseline. These thresholds, which the authors, call task thresholds, may be estimated with modified item response psychometric measurement models...|$|R

50|$|Langs revamped the psychoanalytic {{view of the}} {{unconscious}} mind, in accordance with his evolutionary approach. According to him, {{the unconscious}} mind operates {{on the basis of}} perceptions outside of awareness - <b>subliminal</b> or unconscious <b>perceptions</b> - much as the conscious mind operates on the basis of conscious perceptions, i.e. perceptions within awareness. The unconscious mind evolved, according to Langs, due to the development of language acquisition, which brought with it the uniquely human awareness of the future and, correspondingly, the sense of our own mortality and other death-related issues. This realization of mortality is often evoked by traumatic incidents and, thus, the anxiety-provoking ramifications of those experiences are barred from consciousness, though perceived unconsciously and then adaptively processed towards resolution. In contrast to classical psychoanalytic theory, which tends to view the unconscious mind as a chaotic mix of drives, needs, and wishes (see psychoanalysis), Langs sees the unconscious mind as an adaptive entity functioning outside of direct awareness.|$|R
40|$|What is {{the perceptual}} fate of {{invisible}} stimuli—are they processed {{at all and}} does their processing have consequences for the perception of other stimuli? As has been shown previously in the somatosensory system, even stimuli that are too weak to be consciously detected can influence our perception: <b>Subliminal</b> stimulation impairs <b>perception</b> of near-threshold stimuli and causes a functional deactivation in the somatosensory cortex. In a recent study, we showed that subliminal visual stimuli lead to similar responses, indicated {{by an increase in}} alpha-band power as measured with electroencephalography (EEG). In the current study, we investigated whether a behavioral inhibitory mechanism also exists within the visual system. We tested the detection of peripheral visual target stimuli under three different conditions: Target stimuli were presented alone or embedded in a concurrent train of subliminal stimuli either at the same location as the target or in the opposite hemifield. Subliminal stimuli were invisible due to their low contrast, not due to a masking procedure. We demonstrate that target detection was impaired by the subliminal stimuli, but only when they were presented at the same location as the target. This finding indicates that subliminal, low-intensity stimuli induce a similar inhibitory effect in the visual system as has been observed in the somatosensory system. In line with previous reports, we propose that the function underlying this effect is the inhibition of spurious noise by the visual system...|$|R
40|$|In human {{perception}} studies, visual backward masking {{has been}} used to understand the temporal dynamics of <b>subliminal</b> versus conscious <b>perception.</b> When a brief target stimulus is followed by a masking stimulus after a short interval of < 100 ms, performance on the target is impaired when the target and mask are in close spatial proximity. While the psychophysical properties of backward masking have been studied extensively, there is still debate on the underlying cortical dynamics. One prevailing theory suggests that the impairment of target performance due to the mask is the result of lateral inhibition between the target and mask in feedforward processing. Another prevailing theory suggests that this impairment is due to the interruption of feedback processing of the target by the mask. This computational study demonstrates that both aspects of these theories may be correct. Using a biophysical model of V 1 and V 2, visual processing was modeled as interacting neocortical attractors, which must propagate up the visual stream. If an activating target attractor in V 1 is quiesced enough with lateral inhibition from a mask, or not reinforced by recurrent feedback, it is more likely to burn out before becoming fully active and progressing through V 2 and beyond. Results are presented which simulate metacontrast backward masking with an increasing stimulus interval and with the presence and absence of feedback activity. This showed that recurrent feedback diminishes backward masking effects and can make conscious perception more likely. One model configuration presented a metacontrast noisy mask in the same hypercolumns as the target, and produced type-A masking. A second model configuration presented a target line with two parallel adjacent masking lines, and produced type-B masking. Future work should examine how the model extends to more complex spatial mask configurations...|$|R

[...] Stanislas Dehaene, Consciousness and the Brain, p. 53 Dehaene reviews unconscious brain processing of various forms: <b>subliminal</b> <b>perception,</b> Édouard Claparède's pinprick experiment, blindsight, hemispatial neglect, subliminal priming, unconscious binding (including across sensory modalities, as in the McGurk effect), etc. Dehaene discusses a debate over whether meaning can be processed unconsciously and concludes based on his own research that it can be. An N400 meaning-based wave occurs for unexpected words even when masked or not attended to. Unconscious processing is not just bottom-up but can be enhanced when top-down attention is directed toward a target, even if the target never becomes conscious. Brains can even do some mathematical operations unconsciously, and sitting on a problem to let the unconscious mind work out an answer has proved helpful in several experiments.|$|E

40|$|Functional {{connectivity}} {{networks that}} integrate remote {{areas of the}} brain as working functional units are thought to underlie fundamental mechanisms of perception and cognition, and have emerged as an active area of investigation. However, traditional approaches of measuring functional connectivity are limited in that they rely on a priori specification of one or a few brain regions. Therefore, the development of data-driven and exploratory approaches that assess functional connectivity on a large-scale are required in order to further understand the functional network organization of these processes in both health and disease. In this thesis project, I investigate the roles of functional connectivity in visual search (Chapter 2, (Pantazatos, Yanagihara et al., 2012)) and bistable perception (Chapter 3, (Karten et al., 2013)) using traditional functional connectivity approaches, and develop and apply new approaches to characterize the large-scale networks underlying the processing of supraliminal (Chapter 4, (Pantazatos et al., 2012 a)) and subliminal (Chapter 5, (Pantazatos, Talati et al., 2012 b)) emotional threat signals, speech and song processing in autism (Chapter 6, (Lai et al., 2012)), and face processing in social anxiety disorder (Chapter 7, (Pantazatos et al., 2013)). Finally, I complement the latter study with an investigation of structural morphological abnormalities in social anxiety disorder (Chapter 8, (Talati et al., 2013)). Each of these chapters has been or is about to be published in peer reviewed journals and this thesis provides an overview of the entire body of investigation, based on advances in understanding the role of large-scale neural processes as fundamental organizational units that underlie behavior. In Chapter 2, Independent Components Analysis (ICA), Psychophysiological Interactions (PPI) and Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) analyses were used to investigate the hypothesis that expectation and attention-related interactions between ventral and medial prefrontal cortex and association visual cortex underlie visual search for an object. Results extend previous models of visual search processes to include specific frontal-occipital neuronal interactions during a natural and complex search task. In Chapter 3, PPI analyses revealed percept-dependent changes in connectivity between visual cortex, frontoparietal attention and default mode networks during bistable image perception. These findings advance neural models of bistable perception by implicating the default mode and frontoparietal networks during image segmentation. In Chapters 4 and 5, an exploratory approach based on multivariate pattern analysis of large-scale, condition-dependent functional connectivity was developed and applied in order to further understand the neural mechanisms of threat-related emotion processing. This approach was successful in extracting sufficient information to "brain-read" both unattended supraliminal (Chapter 4) and subliminal (Chapter 5) fear perception in healthy subjects. Informative features for supraliminal fear perception included functional connections between thalamus and superior temporal gyrus, angular gyrus and hippocampus, and fusiform and amygdala, while informative features for <b>subliminal</b> fear <b>perception</b> included middle temporal gyrus, cerebellum and angular gyrus. In psychiatric disorders, large-scale functional connectivity is typically assessed during resting-state (i. e. no task or stimulus). However, disorder-dependent alterations in functional network architecture may be more or less prominent during a stimulus or task that is behaviorally relevant to the disorder, as is exemplified by enhanced long-range, frontal-posterior connectivity during song (vs. speech) perception in autism (Chapter 6). In the case of social anxiety disorder (SAD), pattern analysis of large-scale, functional connectivity during neutral face perception was sensitive enough to discriminate individual subjects with SAD from both healthy controls and panic disorder (Chapter 7). The most informative feature was functional connectivity between left hippocampus and left temporal pole, which was reduced in medication-free SAD subjects, and which increased following 8 -weeks SSRI treatment, with greater increases correlating with greater decreases in symptom severity. This finding parallels results from observed neuroanatomical abnormalities in SAD, which include reduced grey matter volume in the temporal pole, in addition to increased grey matter volume in cerebellum and fusiform (Chapter 8). The above findings suggest promise for emerging functional connectivity and structural-based neurobiomarkers for SAD diagnosis and treatment effects...|$|R

50|$|Alaya {{consciousness}} of the Yogacara Buddhists is Buddhist Unconsciousness. The Yogacara Buddhists were able to recognize the unconscious structuring of experience; {{they were able to}} conceptualize the awareness of awareness and differentiate a dimension of unconscious mental process called - Alayavijnana, from the processes of conscious cognitive awareness - called Pravrittivijnana. The concept of Alayavijnana or Abhutaparikalpa arose, as a <b>subliminal</b> <b>perception</b> of the world, in response to the Abhidharmic developments of earlier Buddhist doctrines. It arose by means of twofold ever-present subtle objective support: a) by the perception of inner appropriation (upādāna-vijñapti) and b) by the outward perception of the receptacle world whose aspects are not clearly delineated (bahirdā apariccinnākāra bhājana-vijñapti). The term, Alaya, means - that which is clung to, adhered to or dwelled in, and is closely connected with bodily existence. Chogyam Trungpa explains that resting in the nature of Alaya means - going beyond the six sense consciousness, and even beyond the seventh consciousness, the fundamental discursive thought process which brings about the other six. Alaya consciousness has as its characteristics of being both cause and effect; as cause it perishes and as fruit it is born, it never remains a single entity.|$|E
50|$|<b>Subliminal</b> <b>perception</b> {{refers to}} the {{individual}} ability to perceive and respond to stimuli that are below the threshold or level of consciousness, which proved to influence thoughts, feelings or actions altogether or separately. There are four distinct methods of communicating subliminally. These are visual stimuli in movies, accelerated speech, embedded images in a print advertisement, and suggestiveness which is not normally seen at first glance.Focussing on Subliminal Communication through visual stimuli, Marketing people have adopted this method even incorporating it films and television shows.Subliminal method of communication first made its debut in a 1957 advertisement, during which a brief message flashed, telling viewers to eat popcorn and drink Coca-Cola. Since that time, subliminal communication has occupied a controversial role in the advertising landscape, with some people claiming it's omnipresent, while others emphasize it's not real. As of publication, there is still an ongoing scientific debate about whether subliminal advertising works.Subliminal messaging {{is a form of}} advertising in which a subtle message is inserted into a standard ad. This subtle message affects the consumer's behavior, but the consumer does not know she's seen the message. For example, a marketer might incorporate a single frame telling consumers to drink tea in a movie. In print media, advertisers might put hidden images or coded messages into ad text.|$|E
5000|$|Since mental {{states are}} {{conscious}} only {{if one is}} aware of those states, every mental state can occur without being conscious. That includes states that exhibit mental qualities, such as the perceptions and bodily sensations that occur in <b>subliminal</b> <b>perception</b> and in blindsight. This view goes against many contemporary views, on which mental qualities are tied inextricably to consciousness. So Rosenthal has developed a [...] "quality-space theory" [...] (also [...] "homomorphism theory") of the mental qualities, which explains what qualitative mental states without appeal to consciousness. All mental qualities are individuated by their positions in a quality space that pertains to their sensory modality. More specifically, we can define a quality space of the physical perceptible properties that mental qualities enable access to, relying just {{on the ability to}} discriminate among those perceptible properties. Mental qualities, then, are the properties of mental states that make that discriminative capacity possible; so they are fixed by the positions they occupy in a quality space corresponding to the quality space of accessed perceptible properties. Because the quality spaces of perceptible properties are determined solely by the ability to discriminate among sample properties, independently of whether the perceptual states are conscious, mental qualities themselves can occur without being conscious. They occur consciously only when one is aware of oneself as being in the relevant qualitative state, on the HOT theory, when one has the relevant HOT.|$|E
40|$|Considerable {{confusion}} {{surrounds the}} notion of ‘subliminal perception’. While empirical findings from <b>subliminal</b> <b>perception</b> experiments appear to demonstrate that <b>subliminal</b> <b>perception</b> can both occur and lead {{to a variety of}} (often dramatic) effects, the present conceptualisations of <b>subliminal</b> <b>perception</b> are problematic since they fail to clarify specifically what is, and is not, known when perceiving subliminally. Consequently, accounts of <b>subliminal</b> <b>perception</b> are vulnerable to sceptical disbelief and criticism, since the coherency of the theoretical framework has not been adequately established. This paper reviews the current accounts and evidence of <b>subliminal</b> <b>perception</b> and proposes a framework for clarifying existing thinking. ‘Knowing’ is discussed as a relation between a cognising subject and a cognised object term, which provides a platform for clarifying the questions concerning the subject and object terms involved when discussing <b>subliminal</b> <b>perception.</b> On this view, in knowing one does not automatically know that one knows (ie, one can know something without having knowledge of knowing it). Furthermore” ‘becoming conscious’ (knowing that one knows) requires a second mental act, independent of the first act of knowing. This theoretical position unifies the competing accounts of <b>subliminal</b> <b>perception,</b> and provides a clear conceptualisation of perception and its objects when perceiving sublimely. Additionally, this account provides an avenue for investigating experimental manipulations of <b>subliminal</b> <b>perception,</b> as well as explaining why subliminal stimuli presentations and not supraliminal ones, lead to the specific variety of empirical findings found in <b>subliminal</b> <b>perception</b> research.
