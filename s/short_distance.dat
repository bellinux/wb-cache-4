5|$|Now in the Erie County town of Wales, NY78 changes monikers from Main Street to Strykersville Road, {{paralleling}} Buffalo Creek northwest {{through the}} rural section of Wales. A <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> northwest, NY78 intersects with CR175 (Center Line Road), which {{connects to the}} Wyoming County line a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> east. For a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> after the intersection, the two routes parallel, with NY78 bypassing the hamlet of Wales Hollow and intersecting with the northern terminus of CR387 (East Creek Road). Still known as Strykersville Road, NY78 parallels Buffalo Creek into the southern terminus of CR385 (Schang Road). The two-lane rural roadway remains the same for several miles to the northwest, crossing an intersection with CR382 (Hunters Creek Road).|$|E
5|$|A {{moderately}} strong hurricane with {{winds of}} 105mph (165km/h) was first spotted on October 6 east of Jamaica. Passing a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> {{south of the}} island, the hurricane tracked northwestward and brushed the Yucatán Peninsula before turning north-northeastward into the Gulf of Mexico. Late on October 9, it made landfall a <b>short</b> <b>distance</b> east of Apalachicola, Florida at peak winds with an estimated pressure of 969mbar. Rapidly weakening to tropical storm status, the cyclone continued northeastward and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from North Carolina on October 11.

40|$|Abstract <b>Shortest</b> <b>distance</b> {{queries are}} {{essential}} {{not only in}} graph analysis and graph mining tasks but also in database applications, when a large graph needs to be dealt with. Such <b>shortest</b> <b>distance</b> queries are frequently issued by end-users or requested as a subroutine in real applications. For intensive queries on large graphs, it is impractical to compute <b>shortest</b> <b>distances</b> on-line from scratch, and impractical to materialize all-pairs <b>shortest</b> <b>distances.</b> In the literature, 2 -hop distance labeling is proposed to index the all-pairs <b>shortest</b> <b>distances.</b> It assigns distance labels to vertices in a large graph in a pre-computing step off-line and then answers <b>shortest</b> <b>distance</b> queries on-line by making use of such distance labels, which avoids exhaustively traversing the large graph when answer-ing queries. However, the existing algorithms to generate 2 -hop distance labels are not scalable to large graphs. Finding an optimal 2 -hop distance labeling is NP-hard, and heuris-tic algorithms may generate large size distance labels while still needing to pre-compute all-pairs shortest paths. In this paper, we propose a multi-hop distance labeling approach, which generates {{a subset of the}} 2 -hop distance labels as index off-line. We can compute the multi-hop distance labels effi-ciently by avoiding pre-computing all-pairs shortest paths. In addition, our multi-hop distance labeling is small in size to b...|$|R
