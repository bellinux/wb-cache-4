50|$|<b>Miss</b> Catherine <b>Spring</b> is a lonely, {{elderly woman}} {{who lives in}} Brookton, among the {{mountains}} and country. She had grown up {{as part of a}} big family, but everyone had died years before, and she had become accustomed to the solitude. She had been struggling financially, and no one had responded to her advertisement for summer boarders, so she had to think of other options. She writes to a niece in Lowell, requesting to stay with her, but soon learns that her niece will already have a relative staying with them for the summer. Spring’s nephew and his wife come to have dinner with <b>Miss</b> <b>Spring</b> without notifying her beforehand. Her nephew, Joseph, requests some cream for his tea, so <b>Miss</b> <b>Spring</b> crosses the street to her neighbor’s house to accommodate him. Spring's neighbor gives her the cream, but on her walk back across the road, Spring has to cross a train platform, hurrying through the train that is stopped there. Before <b>Miss</b> <b>Spring</b> can climb down the stairs on the other side, however, the train departs, leaving her in a train car with two strangers: Miss Ashton and her niece, Alice West. <b>Miss</b> <b>Spring</b> is concerned that her guests will be worried about her absence, but feels extremely comfortable with these two welcoming women. In fact, the women pay for <b>Miss</b> <b>Spring’s</b> train fare back to Brookton, but Spring promises to return the money, writing down their address.|$|R
