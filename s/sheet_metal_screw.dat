40|$|In this research, {{effects of}} screw diameter, screw type, panel type, and end {{distance}} on lateral {{resistance of the}} joints made with drywall and <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>screws</b> were studied in bagasse particleboard {{and the results were}} compared to those obtained from commercial medium density fiberboard (MDF). The accuracy of EYM in prediction of lateral resistance was then investigated. The drywall screws comprised of size 8 with coarse thread and size 10 with fine thread; the <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>screws</b> comprised of size 8 and 10 with normal thread. Results indicated that lateral resistance increased with the increase in the diameter of both screw types, although not statistically significant. The lateral resistance obtained from MDF specimens was 20 % more than that of bagasse specimens. Increase in the end distance also resulted in an increase in the lateral resistance. In all cases, <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>screws</b> showed higher lateral resistance in comparison to those obtained from drywall screws. It can be concluded that Mode IIIs is more accurate than Mode Is in the prediction of lateral resistance in two-member screwed joints (single shear plane) for both MDF and bagasse boards...|$|R

5000|$|After {{hundreds}} {{of the original}} TBF-1 models were built, the TBF-1C began production. The allotment of space for specialized internal and wing-mounted fuel tanks doubled the Avenger's range. By 1943, Grumman began to slowly phase out production of the Avenger to produce F6F Hellcat fighters, and the Eastern Aircraft Division of General Motors took over production, with these aircraft being designated TBM. The Eastern Aircraft plant was located in Ewing, NJ. Grumman delivered a TBF-1, held together with <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>screws,</b> so that the automotive engineers could disassemble it, a part at a time, and redesign the aircraft for automotive style production. This aircraft {{was known as the}} [...] "P-K Avenger" [...] (P-K = Parker-Kalon, manufacturer of <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>screws).</b> Starting in mid-1944, the TBM-3 began production (with a more powerful powerplant and wing hardpoints for drop tanks and rockets).

40|$|In this study, screw {{and nail}} {{withdrawal}} strengths parallel and perpendicular longitudinal to grain of some hardwoods; oak (Quercus castaneifolia), hornbeam (Carpinus betulus), beech (Fagus orientalis), Sycamore (Platanus oriantalis) and poplar (Populus deltoids) were investigated. The {{tests were conducted}} following ASTM D 1761 with specimen dimension of 15 × 5 × 5 (T×R×L). Three kinds of screws namely <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>screw,</b> wood screw and coarse drywall screw with diameter of 4 and 5 mm were used. Three different nails with nominal diameter of 2. 5, 3. 25 and 3. 75 mm were also used. The highest screw withdrawal strengths parallel and perpendicular to grain were related to hornbeam, beech, oak, Sycamore and poplar respectively. Furthermore, the highest nail withdrawal strengths parallel and perpendicular to grain were related to hornbeam, oak, beech, Sycamore and poplar respectively for nails with 3. 75 mm diameter.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to present {{regression}} models for predicting resistance of joints made with screw and plywood members.

Two types of screws including coarse and fine thread drywall screw with 3. 5, 4 and 5 mm in diameter and <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>screw</b> with 4 and 5 mm were used. Results have shown that withdrawal resistance of screw was increased by increasing of screws, diameter and penetrating depth. Joints fabricated with coarse thread drywall screws were higher than those of fine thread drywall screws. Finally, average joint withdrawal resistance of screwed could be predicted by means of the expressions Wc= 2. 127 ×D 1. 072 ×P 0. 520 for coarse thread drywall screws and Wf= 1. 377 ×D 1. 156 ×P 0. 581 for fine thread drywall screws by taking account the diameter and penetrating depth.

40|$|The study {{aimed at}} {{predicting}} bending moment resistance plywood of screw (coarse and fine threads) joints using regression models. Thickness {{of the member}} was 19 mm and compared with medium density fiberboard (MDF) and particleboard with 18 mm thicknesses. Two types of screws including coarse and fine thread drywall screw with nominal diameters of 6, 8 and 10 mm and 3. 5, 4 and 5 cm length respectively and <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>screw</b> with diameters of 8 and 10 and length of 4 cm were used. The {{results of the study}} have shown that bending moment resistance of screw was increased by increasing of screws diameter and penetrating depth. Screw Length was found to have a larger influence on bending moment resistance than screw diameter. Bending moment resistance with coarse thread drywall screws was higher than those of fine thread drywall screws. The highest bending moment resistance (71. 76 N. m) was observed in joints made with coarse screw which were 5 mm in diameter and 28 mm in depth of penetration. The lowest bending moment resistance (12. 08 N. m) was observed in joints having fine screw with 3. 5 mm diameter and 9 mm penetrations. Furthermore, bending moment resistance in plywood was higher than those of medium density fiberboard (MDF) and particleboard. Finally, it has been found that the ultimate bending moment resistance of plywood joint can be predicted following formula Wc = 0. 189 ×D 0. 726 ×P 0. 577 for coarse thread drywall screws and Wf = 0. 086 ×D 0. 942 ×P 0. 704 for fine ones according to diameter and penetrating depth.

50|$|This {{self-locking}} {{property is}} {{one reason for the}} very large use of the screw in threaded fasteners such as wood <b>screws,</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>screws,</b> studs and bolts. Tightening the fastener by turning it puts compression force on the materials or parts being fastened together, but no amount of force from the parts will cause the screw to untighten. This property is also the basis for the use of screws in screw top container lids, vises, C-clamps, and screw jacks. A heavy object can be raised by turning the jack shaft, but when the shaft is released it will stay at whatever height it is raised to.|$|R

40|$|Most {{air duct}} system {{components}} are {{assembled in the}} field and are mechanically fastened by <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>screws</b> (for <b>sheet</b> metal-to-sheet <b>metal)</b> or by drawbands (for flex duct-to-sheet metal). Air sealing is separate from this mechanical fastening and is usually achieved using tape or mastic products after mechanical fastening. Field observations have shown that mechanical fastening rarely meets code or manufacturers requirements and that sealing procedures are similarly inconsistent. To address these problems, Proctor Engineering Group (PEG) is developing a system of joining ducts (called PEGIT) that combines the mechanical fastening and sealing into a single self-contained procedure. The PEGIT system uses a shaped flexible seal between specially designed <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> duct fittings to both seal and fasten duct sections together. Figure 1 shows the inner duct fitting complete with rubber seal. This seal provides the air seal for the completed fitting and is shaped to allow the inner and outer fittings to slide together, and then to lock the fittings in place. The illustration in Figure 2 shows the approximate cross section of the rubber seal that shows how the seal has a lip that is angled backwards. This angled lip allows the joint to be pushed together by folding flat but then its long axis makes it stiff in the pulling apart direction. This study was undertaken to assist PEG in some of the design aspects of this system and to test the performance of the PEGIT system. This study was carried out in three phases. The initial phase evaluated the performance of a preliminary seal design for the PEGIT system. After the first phase, the seal was redesigned and this new seal was evaluated in the second phase of testing. The third phase performed more detailed testing of the second seal design to optimize the production tolerances of the <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> fittings. This report summarizes our findings from the first two phases and provides details about the third phase of testing...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop and evaluate methods of improving fastener and joint performance in wood-based composite case furniture. In general, several types of joints and fasteners were tested and evaluated. This study, accordingly, provides much of the information needed for the product engineering of case furniture constructed of particleboard and medium density fiberboard. In order to achieve the desired objective and to produce practical results, the boards chosen for the project were representative of the quality of the material usually used in the construction of case furniture. Results of the edge breaking strength tests indicated that breaking strength of the corner joints increased approximately in proportion to the square root of both IB and MOR properties. A clear relationship between edge breaking strength and MOE, MOR, and IB could not be found in either the tension or the compression tests. Edge pull-out test results indicated that edge distance and hole diameter have a significant effect on the edge pull-out strength of the particleboard and medium density fiberboard. Test results for withdrawal strength of screws indicate that both face and edge withdrawal strength of screws were close to what have been obtained in the previous studies done by Eckelman. Using adhesive with screw, withdrawal strength resistance was increased in both MDF and particleboard panels. It is clear that the performance of the joints is not related to the cost of the fasteners. In many cases, joints with low performance were the most expensive. Cap screws, for example, had the highest cost but low performance. On the other hand, <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>screws</b> with glue were cheaper but higher in performance. ...|$|R
5000|$|The Armalite AR-16 {{appeared}} in the later 1950s. The AR-16, a 7.62mm NATO selective-fire rifle, was Eugene Stoner's final design for ArmaLite. The AR-16 and its predecessor, the AR-12 were designed by Stoner in response to demands by the military forces of smaller, less developed nations for a less expensive, yet state-of-the-art selective-fire military rifle that unlike the AR-10 and AR-15, could be produced inexpensively of heavy-gauge <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> using automatic <b>screw</b> machines, lathes, and presses. The AR-12 originally featured a direct-impingement (DI) gas operation system, but this was changed to a more conventional short-stroke gas piston in the AR-16 after ArmaLite sold the production rights to the DI system to Colt Firearms. The AR-16 had a short, 15-inch barrel, hinged wooden butt, and weighed 8.75 pounds empty; only three examples were built. [...] Eugene Stoner left ArmaLite in 1961, shortly before Fairchild divested itself of ownership.|$|R
40|$|PhDAbstract: The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to investigate the interaction of local and overall flexural buckling in cold-formed stainless steel columns. Literature study exposes a lack of understanding of this subject and a need for experimental data, particularly on the local-overall interaction buckling of stainless steel open sections. Two separate experimental programs were therefore carried out. The first program included 36 tests on pin-ended lipped channel columns. Three alloys were considered: AISI 304, AISI 430 and 3 Cr 12. The specimens were designed to fail by local-overall interaction buckling in the inelastic stress range, thus highlighting the non-linear behaviour of stainless steel. Half of the specimens were tested under a concentric load. The other half had the load applied with a nominal eccentricity of Le/ 1500. The test results demonstrate the imperfection sensitivity of local-overall interaction buckling and illustrate the shift in effective centroid in pin-ended columns with singly symmetric cross-section. The second experimental program studied local-overall interaction buckling in 24 pin-ended stainless steel I-section columns. The specimens consisted of plain channels connected back-to-back using <b>sheet</b> <b>metal</b> <b>screws.</b> Two alloys were considered: AISI 304 and AISI 404. Local and overall imperfections were carefully measured in both experimental programs. Extensive material testing was carried out on the alloys employed in the experimental program, in order to determine tensile and compressive material properties, anisotropic parameters and enhanced corner properties. A detailed finite element model is presented, which includes non-linear material behaviour, anisotropy, increased material properties of the corner areas and local and overall imperfections. The model was verified against the two aforementioned experimental programs and against additional data available in literature on stainless steel SHS columns. The model yielded excellent predictions of the specimen failure mode, ultimate strength and load-deformation behaviour. The finite element model was used to generate additional data for stainless steel columns with lipped channel, plain channel, SHS and I-shaped cross-section, failing by local-overall interaction buckling. The parametric studies covered the practical ranges of overall and cross-sectional slenderness values. The Australian/New Zealand, European and North American standards for stainless steel were evaluated using the available data. The comparison reveals an inability of the design codes to properly account for the interaction effect as the cross-sectional slenderness increases. Predictions are unsafe for I-section columns with intermediate or high cross-sectional slenderness. A direct strength method is proposed for stainless steel columns, accounting for the local-overall interaction effect. The method offers a simple design solution which fits {{within the framework of the}} current Australian and North-American standards...|$|R
