The system, which {{was introduced in}} September 2010 on its test fleet of BlueOn electric hatchbacks, provides synthetic audio feedback mimicking the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> idling internal combustion engine.|$|E
5|$|Dust {{kicked up}} by the winds of the parent thunderstorm, heavy rain and hail, and the {{darkness}} of night are all factors which can reduce the visibility of tornadoes. Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only weather radar observations, or possibly the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> approaching tornado, serve as any warning {{to those in the}} storm's path. Most significant tornadoes form under the storm's updraft base, which is rain-free, making them visible. Also, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even the thickest clouds. Night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.|$|E
5|$|Night on Bald Mountain by Modest Mussorgsky and Ave Maria by Franz Schubert. At midnight {{the devil}} Chernabog awakes and summons evil spirits and restless souls from their graves to Bald Mountain. The spirits dance and {{fly through the}} air until driven back by the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Angelus bell as night fades into dawn. A chorus is heard singing Ave Maria as a line of robed monks is {{depicted}} walking with lighted torches through a forest and into {{the ruins of a}} cathedral.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Voice {{was later}} adapted into an opera with {{libretto}} by Hwang and music by Philip Glass and as <b>a</b> film-- <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Voice, directed by Susan Hoffman and written by Lane Nishikawa and Natsuko Ohama.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Voice is a 2002 {{short film}} {{based upon the}} play The <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Voice by American playwright David Henry Hwang.

50|$|The <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> gunshot {{may have}} two sources; the muzzle blast itself, and any sound {{produced}} by a transonic or supersonic projectile. Suppressors help to reduce the level <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> firearm, by providing a large area for the propellant gas to expand and cool before release.|$|R
5|$|The Tiger also {{featured}} in the 2008 film adaptation of the Get Smart TV series. A replica Tiger had to be constructed using a stock Sunbeam Alpine and re-created Tiger badging as no available Tiger {{could be found in}} Canada, where the film was produced. The production team recorded the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> authentic Tiger owned by a collector in Los Angeles and edited it into the film.|$|E
5|$|The film {{begins with}} the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{orchestra}} tuning and Deems Taylor's introduction from Fantasia. Panels showing various segments from Fantasia fly in outer space and form the set and stage for an orchestra. Musicians take their seats and tune up and animators draw at their desks before James Levine approaches the conductor's podium and signals {{the beginning of the}} first piece.|$|E

25|$|Flanging, chorus and {{reverberation}} (reverb) are all delay-based sound effects. With flanging and chorus, {{the delay}} time is very short and usually modulated. With reverberation {{there are multiple}} delays and feedback so that individual echoes are blurred together, recreating the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> acoustic space.|$|E
25|$|Habituation – This is {{a process}} in which the brain learns to ignore repetitive, {{meaningless}} stimuli while remaining sensitive to others. A good example of this is a person who can sleep through loud traffic in a large city, but is awakened promptly due to the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> alarm or crying baby. Reticular formation nuclei that modulate activity of the cerebral cortex are part of the ascending reticular activating system.|$|E
50|$|The percussive <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> col legno battuto {{has a clear}} pitch element {{determined}} by {{the distance of the}} bow from the bridge at the point <b>of</b> contact. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> group <b>of</b> players will never strike the string in exactly the same place, the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> section <b>of</b> violins playing col legno battuto is dramatically different from the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single violin doing so.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Voice is a 2003 operatic {{adaptation}} of the play The <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Voice by American playwright David Henry Hwang. The music is written by composer Philip Glass and the libretto is written by Hwang. The opera is actually made up of two short operas: The <b>Sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Voice and Hotel of Dreams. The opera is notable for being specifically written for the theatre and not an opera house. It had its premiere on May 24, 2003 at the American Repertory Theatre. It was directed by Robert Woodruff and featured Eugene Perry.|$|R
25|$|However, {{the highest}} death toll was caused during an {{accident}} at Bethnal Green tube station on 8 March 1943, when 1,500 people entered the station. The crowd suddenly panicked on hearing the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unfamiliar explosion (in fact {{this was a}} top-secret anti-aircraft rocket). Someone stumbled on the stairs, and the crowd pushing on, were falling {{on top of one}} another, and 173 people were crushed to death in the disaster.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the splash}} pool are several effects {{such as a}} giant water tower which {{periodically}} releases a torrent of water, and the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> organ coming from the spire of a supposedly submerged church. Until 2006, the effects included a damaged gas tank firing a large flame approximately every 10 minutes, but the gas tank no longer operates because the cylinders {{that were used to}} fuel the flame were removed {{to make way for the}} construction of Stealth. The other effects are also currently nonoperational and have been out of order for several years.|$|E
25|$|Spatial {{location}} (see: Sound localization) {{represents the}} cognitive placement {{of a sound}} in an environmental context; including the placement of a sound on both the horizontal and vertical plane, {{the distance from the}} sound source and the characteristics of the sonic environment. In a thick texture, it is possible to identify multiple sound sources using a combination of spatial location and timbre identification. It is the main reason why we can pick the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> oboe in an orchestra and the words of a single person at a cocktail party.|$|E

25|$|On 14 July 2009, Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh was the Guest of Honour for the Bastille Day Celebrations held in Paris. The 2009 Bastille Day {{military}} parade {{opened with}} a contingent of Indian troops drawn from the three services (Indian Army, Indian Navy and Indian Air Force). Soldiers including Jawans of Maratha Light Infantry Regiment Centre (MLIRC) marched down the Avenue Champs-Élysées to the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Indian military band playing Indian martial tunes including Saare Jahan Se Achcha, Haste Lushai and Kadam Kadam Badaye Ja.|$|E
25|$|To tune a violin, the A string {{is first}} tuned to a {{standard}} pitch (usually 440Hz). (When accompanying or playing with a fixed-pitch instrument such as a piano or accordion, the violin tunes to it.) The other strings are then tuned {{against each other in}} intervals of perfect fifths by bowing them in pairs. A minutely higher tuning is sometimes employed for solo playing to give the instrument a brighter sound; conversely, Baroque music is sometimes played using lower tunings to make the violin's sound more gentle. After tuning, the instrument's bridge may be examined to ensure that it is standing straight and centered between the inner nicks of the f-holes; a crooked bridge may significantly affect the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> otherwise well-made violin. After extensive playing, the holes into which the tuning pegs are inserted can become worn, which can lead the peg to slip under tension. This can lead to the pitch of the string dropping, or if the peg becomes completely loose, to the string completely losing tension. A violin in which the tuning pegs are slipping needs to be repaired by a luthier or violin repairperson. Peg dope or peg compound, used regularly, can delay the onset of such wear, while allowing the pegs to turn smoothly.|$|E
25|$|During lulls in the shelling, Hemingway {{repeatedly}} told Walton {{how much}} he hated his mother. Hemingway loathed her because she had accepted money from him, even while she condemned the books he wrote on moral grounds. Hemingway later saved Walton's life during the battle. Hemingway recognized the <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> oncoming German plane, and threw Walton out of the jeep they were riding in just moments before it was strafed. The two men parted, but met again on New Year's Eve in London. Walton told Hemingway {{that he was going}} to have dinner with Hemingway's wife, Martha Gellhorn. Hemingway and Gellhorn were on the verge of divorce after several rocky years of marriage. Hemingway invited himself to the dinner. Hemingway ridiculed and taunted his wife all night, and Walton stood up for her. In the early hours of the next morning, Hemingway stripped to his underwear, put a bucket on his head, and banged on Gellhorn's door with a mop, demanding to be let in. Walton moved into the Hôtel Ritz in Paris in January 1945, covering the war from the liberated city. Hemingway, now openly dating Mary Welsh even though his divorce was not yet final, was in one of the happiest moods of his life. He bragged openly to Walton about his powerful sex life and happiness.|$|E
