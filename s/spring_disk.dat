This research sought to determine whether long-term agricultural practices affect the baseline erodibility properties of a soil. Two soils from Throckmorton-Purdue Agricultural Center in Tippecanoe County, Indiana were used during this experiment. One soil was treated with a long-term conventional tillage (fall chisel, <b>spring</b> <b>disk)</b> system and the other soil was treated with a long-term no-till system. The soils’ interrill erodibility, and rill erodibility and critical hydraulic shear stress were measured under a rainfall simulator using soil boxes without crop residue, and in miniature-flumes respectively. The soil treated with a long-term conventional tillage (fall chisel, <b>spring</b> <b>disk)</b> system had a greater baseline interrill erodibility compared to the soil treated with a long-term no-till system.

Moldboard plow, chisel plow, <b>spring</b> <b>disk,</b> ridge-tillage, and no-tillage systems were evaluated after 32 {{years of a}} corn (Zea mays L.) and soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr. ] rotation and 27 years of continuous corn in central Iowa, U. S. A. Productivity was quantified using yield, while soil fertility status was evaluated by collecting four, 5 -cm diameter soil cores {{to a depth of}} 0. 9 m from each treatment, dividing them into four depth increments (0 – 15 -, 15 – 30 -, 30 – 60 -, and 60 – 90 -cm), analyzing them for bulk density (BD), NO 3 -N, NH 4 - N, electrical conductivity (EC), pH, Mehlich- 3 extractable P, K, Ca, Mg and DTPA-extractable Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn, and interpreting the data using Iowa State University (ISU) guidelines. Production costs for each tillage and cropping system were also computed. To account for genetic and agronomic changes during the 30 -year study period, yields were examined for establishment, maintenance, and intensification/ recovery phases. Rotated corn yield averaged 8. 6, 8. 8, and 11. 6 Mg ha- 1 and soybean yield averaged 2. 7, 3. 2, and 3. 4 Mg ha- 1, respectively, for each of the phases. Continuous corn from 1988 to 2006 averaged 7. 5 and 10. 1 Mg ha- 1 for the maintenance and intensification/recovery phases, respectively. Fixed plus variable machinery costs for corn ranged from 233 to 354 USD ha- 1, while for soybean they ranged from 194 to 280 USD ha- 1. Net returns to land, labor and management ranged from 233 to 269, 560 to 620, and 437 to 483 USD ha- 1 for continuous corn, rotated corn, and rotated soybean, respectively. Based on 9 - year (2003 – 2011) average grain prices and yields from this study, the corn–soybean rotation was twice as profitable as continuous corn. Soil-test P and K measurements, as well as calculated P and K removal, suggest that nutrient mining occurred {{during the course of this}} study. The soil-test data also indicate that further studies are needed regarding plant availability of subsoil K and its impact on fertilizer recommendations.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of aqueous soil extracts from the soil of a spring wheat monoculture on seed germination energy and capacity, the length of the first leaf and of the longest radicle as well as the number of radicles. Moreover, the content of 0 -dihydroxyphenols in the soil was compared in the last year of the study. The soil used to prepare the solutions came from a field experiment established on medium heavy mixed rendzina soil. Spring wheat, cv. Zebra, was grown using plough tillage and two conservation tillage methods in the presence of undersown crops (red clover, Westerwolds ryegrass) and stubble crops (lacy phacelia, white mustard). Germination energy of the seeds watered with the soil extracts from the ploughed plots was significantly higher than this trait in the seeds watered with the extracts from the conservation tillage treatments with <b>spring</b> <b>disking</b> of the catch crops. Germination energy and capacity of spring wheat in the control treatment watered with distilled water were significantly higher compared to the other treatments under evaluation. Spring wheat watered with the aqueous extract prepared from the soil obtained from the plough tillage treatment produced a significantly longer first leaf compared to the treatments in which both conservation tillage methods had been used. The shortest leaf and the lowest number of radicles were produced by the seedlings watered with the soil extract from the treatment with the white clover stubble crop. Radicle length was not significantly differentiated by the soil extracts under consideration.

This component consists of two profiled rock bolt washers, two <b>disk</b> <b>springs,</b> and three guide bars. The <b>disk</b> <b>spring</b> and <b>disk</b> washer material differs in stiffness. The construction materials ensure that at first the springs under loading are partially compressed, and then the rock bolt washer is plastically deformed.

Three herbicides (atrazine, metolachlor, and cyanazine) were applied to the source area in each spring. Six vegetative buffer strips, 1. 52 m wide ¥ 20. 12 m long, were isolated with metal borders downslope of the source area in a well established bromegrass (Bromus inermis) waterway. These strips provided for three replications of two drainage to buffer area ratio treatments of 15 : 1 and 30 : 1. Herbicide retention was dependent on the antecedent moisture conditions of the strips. These retentions ranged from 11 to 100 % for atrazine, 16 to 100 % for metolachlor, and 8 to 100 % for cyanazine. Herbicide retention by the buffer strips for the two treatments {{were not significantly different}} for the observed storm events. Herbicide concentrations in solution in outflow from the strips were less than the inflow concentrations for all the three herbicides. Infiltration was the key process for herbicide retention by the buffer strips, although there was some adsorption to in-place soil and/or vegetation. Metolachlor concentrations in sediment increased in outflow for the two treatments; however, the opposite was true for atrazine and cyanazine. Herbicide retention by sediment deposition in the strip represented about 5 % of the total herbicide retention by the buffer strips. The buffer strips were found to have high percent sediment retention, ranging from 40 to 100 %; thus, the strips would be more effective for retaining strongly adsorbed herbicides...|$|R

The static {{characteristics of the}} <b>disk</b> <b>spring</b> and the QZS isolator are investigated. The optimal combination of the configurative parameters is derived to achieve a wide displacement range around the equilibrium position in which the stiffness has a low value and changes slightly. By considering the overloaded or underloaded conditions, the dynamic equations are established for both force and displacement excitations. The frequency response curves (FRCs) are obtained by using the harmonic balance method (HBM) and confirmed by the numerical simulation. The stability of the steady-state solution is analyzed by applying Floquet theory. The force, absolute displacement, and acceleration transmissibility are defined to evaluate the isolation performance. Effects of the offset displacement, excitation amplitude, and damping ratio on the QZS isolator and the equivalent system (ELS) are studied. The results demonstrate that the QZS isolator for overloaded or underloaded can exhibit different stiffness characteristics with changing excitation amplitude. If loaded with an appropriate mass, excited by not too large amplitude, and owned a larger damper, the QZS isolator can possess better isolation performance than its ELS in low frequency range...|$|R

The objectives {{of this research}} were to investigate {{the influence of a}} winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) cover crop on selected soil physical properties and early development of corn in a corn (Zea mays) -soybean (Glycine max) crop rotation. The measurements were conducted on two Indiana research farms, both with dominant silt loam soil types during seasons 2000, 2001 and 2002. The experimental design was a split-split plot, with tillage treatment as the main effect (<b>spring</b> <b>disking</b> conventional till (CT) and no-till (NT)), two cash crops as the first split (soybean (B) and corn (C)), and three cover crop treatments as the second split (no cover crop (N), early (E) and regular (R) cover crop desiccation). Soil aggregation was usually increased by either E or R relative to N cover crop, and more consistently so in CT than NT. Both the R and E treatments tended to decrease bulk density, cone resistance and soil temperature, but increase total porosity, air-filled porosity, water retention and vane shear strength in both tillage systems, whereas K sat tended to improve with E or R cover treatments only in CT. Steady-state infiltration, measured on N and R only, tended to improve with R in both tillage systems. For both tillage treatments, both E and R increased soil water content, when compared with N, except in the case of early spring drought, when R transpired more water than E and was similar in water content to N. In years without early spring drought, early corn shoot and root growth following E in CT was either greater or not different than the other two treatments, whereas in NT the R 3 ̆e E 3 ̆e N pattern was frequently observed. In case of early spring drought, the E treatment on both tillage systems had better corn growth than both R and N treatments. The results suggest that despite generally comparable soil structure improvements by both E and R treatments in both tillage systems, early desiccation is the more desirable treatment prior to corn production due to better soil water conservation in droughty weather. ...|$|R

It took Digital a long time to achieve adequate MTBF (mean time before failure) performance standards for the RA-90, which delayed its time to market sufficiently to be undersold by competitors, who, by then, had introduced smaller form factors (smaller disks) at higher capacities and greater reliability. RA-90 drives were built at Digital's 1 million square foot (93,000 m²) facility in Colorado <b>Springs</b> and the <b>disks</b> were made in Tempe, Arizona.|$|R
5000|$|Classical Brookfield viscometers {{employ the}} {{principle}} of rotational viscometry - the torque required to turn an object, such as a spindle, in a fluid indicates the viscosity of the fluid. Torque is applied through a calibrated <b>spring</b> to a <b>disk</b> or bob spindle immersed in test fluid and the spring deflection measures the viscous drag of the fluid against the spindle. [...] The amount of viscous drag {{is proportional to the}} amount of torque required to rotate the spindle, and thus to the viscosity of a Newtonian fluid. [...] In the case of non-Newtonian fluids, Brookfield viscosities measured under the same conditions (model, spindle, speed, temperature, time of test, container, and any other sample preparation procedures that may affect the behavior of the fluid) can be compared. When developing a new test method, trial and error is often necessary {{in order to determine the}} proper spindle and speeds. Successful test methods will deliver a % torque reading between 10 and 100. The rheological behavior of the test fluid can be observed using the same spindle at different speeds, but because the geometry of the fluid around a rotating bob or disk spindle in a large container does not allow a single shear rate to be assigned, proper rheometry is not feasible using this setup.|$|R

Their timely surgical removal or complex of conservative measures allow to correct the processes of development and growth, improve the health of grown-up population. Research purpose was to learn the development and becoming of intervertebral disks in the prenatal period of ontogenesis of man and their anatomic features at new-born. The terms of the enlarge of the intervertebral disks, the peculiarities of the development, differentiation of their cells, fibers and vessels have been elucidated by means of the microscopy methods of serial histological sections of 65 spine specimens {{on the site of the}} spine column of embryos, prefetuses and 45 fetuses and human neonates. Research conclusions: 1. At the end of early period of ontogenesis basic structural components of disk are determined. 2. There are dense fibred plates of fibrous ring in the external area of disk, in a middle area is a fibrous cartilage, and a gel kernel is formed in a center. The external s more differentiated dense fibred tissue and fibrous cartilage provide the dense attaching of disk to the bodies of vertebrae, and the less differentiated, but resilient tissue of gel kernel provides a <b>spring</b> function of <b>disk...</b>|$|R
40|$|The article {{represents}} {{a summary of}} findings of various research projects aimed at the optimization of specific items of small size machines developed and pilot tested {{at different stages of}} construction operations. For 15 years, Department of Mechanization of Construction Processes, Kharkiv National University of Civil Engineering and Architecture has been engaged in design, pilot testing and monitoring of practical application of small size construction machinery. All machines and items of equipment have adsorbed numerous research findings, and no similar products are available in Ukraine and worldwide. The authors analyze different items of construction machines that have already been tested in the course of construction operations. They include a twin-piston coun- terflow mortar-and-concrete pump, two-piston direct-flow mortar-and-concrete pumps equipped with ball valves, <b>spring</b> valves and <b>disk</b> valves, advanced cascade concrete mixing machines. Each of the above machines can operate in pursuance of a pre-set pattern of shotcrete operations. All machines are universal, as twin-piston concrete pumps may pump concrete mixes having different workability rates; they {{can also be used to}} transport building mixes in horizontal and vertical directions; they are applied for shotcrete operations. They are efficiently used in the preparation of different mixes. All machines and items of equipment are protected by Ukraine-wide patents. They are recommended for wide-scale use due to sophisticated structural solutions invested into their design.
