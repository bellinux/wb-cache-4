40|$|Red macroalgae produce UV screen photoprotectors (Mycosporine like amino acids, MAAs) in {{response}} to increased UV radiation. They are low-molecular weight water-soluble nitrogen enriched molecules, absorbing UV radiation in the wavelength range 310 - 365 nm due to their cyclohexenone or cyclohexenimine chromophores. MAAs were quantified by means of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The photoprotection capacity in the macroalgae has been inferred by their accumulation under increased UV radiation (spatial and temporal changes), by the correlation with reduced photoinhibition and decreased photodamage and by the increase of antioxidant activity in the cells. Despite the fact MAAs are nitrogen compounds, only few studies on nitrogen enrichment have been conducted. In this study, the influence of inorganic nitrogen on the accumulation of MAAs both under artificial and solar UVR in several macroalgae is presented. Both MAAs and biliproteins contents of several species increased in ammonium enriched seawater. Algae with high internal N content presented a higher photoprotection capacity, estimated as in vivo chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, than those growing under N depletion conditions. The relative composition of MAAs changed both under high irradiance and blue light, increasing the content of palythine and asterina- 330 in relation to porphyra- 334 and shinorine. In bifactorial experiments of UVR and nitrate, a positive synergic response of both variables on the production of MAAs was found. MAA content also increased under ammonium enrichment, obtained from fishpond effluents. The highest MAA-productivity was observed in outdoor-grown algae, indicating a positive effect of increased PAR and UVR on MAA accumulation. In conclusion, the accumulation of MAAs is favoured by inorganic nitrogen enrichment {{in the presence of}} UVR. MAAs can protect the algae against increased UV radiation through a double function: (1) UV <b>screen</b> <b>capacity</b> in both UVA and UVB radiation and (2) Antioxidant capacity of both oxo- and imino-MAAs.

METHOD: Using the 28 -item version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 28), we examined two samples: a random sample (n = 854) and a sample of clients of a psychosocial support programme in these camps (n = 23). Sensitivity, specificity and positive- and negative predictive values were estimated for several cut-off scores of the GHQ- 28.

As a proof-of-concept, this workflow was applied to discriminate between Escherichia coli mutants with gradual expression of the glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase.

40|$|Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) {{radiation}} {{can have}} a negative impact on the growth and development of plants. Plants tolerant to UV-B alleviate these effects using UV-screening pigments that reduce the penetration of UV-B into mesophyll tissue. Little is known about the relative contribution of specific phenolic compounds to the <b>screening</b> <b>capacity</b> of leaves. The D 1 and D 2 proteins constituting the photosystem (PS) II reaction center heterodimer are targets of UV-B radiation and can be used as an in situ sensor for UV penetration into photosynthetic tissue. Degradation of these proteins occurs under very low fluences of UV-B, and is strongly accelerated in the presence of visible light. Using the D 1 -D 2 degradation assay, we characterized UV-B sensitivity of Arabidopsis mutants (tt 4, tt 5, and fah 1) that are genetically altered in their composition of phenolic compounds. We found that changes in phenol metabolism result in altered rates of PSII reaction center heterodimer degradation under mixtures of photosynthetically active radiation and UV-B. A comparison of D 2 degradation kinetics showed increased UV sensitivity of the Landsberg (Landsberg erecta) tt 5 mutant relative to the Landsberg tt 4 mutant and the Landsberg wild type. Despite a lack of flavonoid accumulation, the tt 4 mutant is not particularly UV sensitive. However, the tolerance of this mutant to UV-B may reflect the increased accumulation of sinapate esters that strongly absorb in the UV range, and may thus protect the plant against environmentally relevant UV-B radiation. This sinapate-mediated protection is less obvious for the tt 4 mutant of Columbia ecotype, indicating that the relative contribution of particular phenolics to the total <b>screening</b> <b>capacity</b> varies with the genetic background. The role of sinapate esters in UV screening is further substantiated by the results with the fah 1 mutant where absence of most of the sinapate esters results in a significantly accelerated degradation of D 2 under mixed light conditions. Because the latter mutant is not expected to be deficient in flavonoids, the relative contribution of flavonoids as protectants of PSII reaction center heterodimer against UV-B damage in Arabidopsis needs to be re-evaluated vis-a-vis screening by simple phenolics like sinapate esters...|$|R

In this article, the authors describe a cell-based, high-throughput assay that can identify gene products capable of modulating the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) signaling pathways in human endothelial cells. The assay uses real-time PCR technology to measure downstream re-porter mRNA transcripts induced upon cytokine stimulation in a 96 -well plate format and has been adapted for use with re-combinant adenoviruses.
