25|$|There {{are many}} options for rotor mounting. IS is a six-bolt mount {{and is the}} {{industry}} standard. Centerlock is patented by Shimano and uses a <b>splined</b> interface along with a lockring to secure the disc. The advantages of centerlock are that the <b>splined</b> interface is theoretically stiffer, and removing the disc is quicker because it only requires one lockring to be removed. Some of the disadvantages are that the design is patented requiring a licensing fee from Shimano. A Shimano cassette lockring tool (or an external BB tool in case of through-axle hub) is needed to remove the rotor and is more expensive and less common than a Torx key. Advantages of IS six-bolt are {{that there are more}} choices when it comes to hubs and rotors.|$|E

They rapidly became well established in the bicycle and motor tricycle world but were not common on cars until around 1907.

These wheels owed their resistance to braking and accelerative stresses to their two inner rows of tangential spokes. An outer row of radial spokes gave lateral strength against cornering strains. These wheels were deeply dished so that steering pivot pins might lie as near {{as possible to the}} center-line of the tires.
