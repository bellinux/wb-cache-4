40|$|This {{publication}} {{is primarily}} {{intended for use}} by NASA personnel engaged in managing or implementing <b>trend</b> <b>analysis</b> programs. 'Trend analysis' refers to the observation of current activity {{in the context of}} the past in order to infer the expected level of future activity. NASA <b>trend</b> <b>analysis</b> was divided into 5 categories: problem, performance, supportability, programmatic, and reliability. Problem <b>trend</b> <b>analysis</b> uncovers multiple occurrences of historical hardware or software problems or failures in order to focus future corrective action. Performance <b>trend</b> <b>analysis</b> observes changing levels of real-time or historical flight vehicle performance parameters such as temperatures, pressures, and flow rates as compared to specification or 'safe' limits. Supportability <b>trend</b> <b>analysis</b> assesses the adequacy of the spaceflight logistics system; example indicators are repair-turn-around time and parts stockage levels. Programmatic <b>trend</b> <b>analysis</b> uses quantitative indicators to evaluate the 'health' of NASA programs of all types. Finally, reliability <b>trend</b> <b>analysis</b> attempts to evaluate the growth of system reliability based on a decreasing rate of occurrence of hardware problems over time. Procedures for conducting all five types of <b>trend</b> <b>analysis</b> are provided in this publication, prepared through the joint efforts of the NASA <b>Trend</b> <b>Analysis</b> Working Group...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{defines a}} program-level <b>trend</b> <b>analysis</b> effort {{that can be}} applied to large solid rocket motors. The effort is {{especially}} applicable to large segmented rocket motors such as the Space Transportation System's solid rocket boosters. Five types of <b>trend</b> <b>analysis</b> are discussed for different aspects of a rocket motor program, (performance, reliability, problem, supportability, and programmatic). Ideas are offered for implementing and performing a program-level <b>trend</b> <b>analysis</b> effort by giving suggestions for selecting computer capabilities, choosing parameters, selecting statistical processes, routine screening for trends, analyzing significant trends (for example, looking for related trends and determining if adverse trends are resolved), and reporting results of <b>trend</b> <b>analysis.</b> The use of program-level trending allows for the ability to easily transfer data between organizations and easily use the data to correlate trends from the various organizations to find causal relationships. Efficiency is enhanced from upper level management to the shop floor at vendor locations by using the same <b>trend</b> <b>analysis</b> software and methodology at all organizations...|$|R

40|$|This {{advice is}} {{situated}} in a self-tasking dossier aimed at formulating recommendations to optimize the methodology of the control program of the FASFC in order to enable the study of trends. In this regard a distinction {{has to be made}} between trend watching and <b>trend</b> <b>analysis.</b> It is examined to what extent the results of the control program can be used for <b>trend</b> <b>analysis.</b> On one hand, a model is developed to calculate the sampling sizes needed in order to determine statistically, at a particular assumed initial prevalence, the existing of a <b>trend</b> (<b>trend</b> <b>analysis).</b> On the other hand, a model is developed to calculate the sample sizes in order to confirm, with a particular confidence, an observed trend in a particular prevalence during subsequent years. These models are applied to several case studies.

40|$|The Thermal Control Surfaces Experiment (TCSE) on the LDEF was a {{comprehensive}} experiment that combined in-space measurements with extensive pre- and post-flight analyses of thermal control surfaces {{to determine the}} effects of exposure to the low earth orbit (LEO) space environment. The TCSE is the first space experiment to directly measure in-situ total hemispherical reflectance of thermal control surfaces in the same way they are routinely measured in the laboratory. In-space optical measurements performed by the TCSE provide the unique opportunity for <b>trend</b> <b>analysis</b> of the performance of materials in the space environment. Such <b>trend</b> <b>analysis</b> of flight data offers the potential to develop an empirical life time prediction model for several thermal control surfaces. For material research, <b>trend</b> <b>analysis</b> of the TCSE flight data, particularly the spectral data, can provide insight into the damage mechanisms of space exposure. <b>Trend</b> <b>analysis</b> for the TCSE samples has been limited to those materials that were not significantly eroded by the atomic oxygen (AO) environment. The performance of several materials on the LDEF mission was dominated by AO effects. <b>Trend</b> <b>analysis</b> was performed on both the detailed spectral reflectance measurements (in-space, pre-flight, and post-flight) and on the integrated solar absorptance. Results of this analysis for the five selected TCSE materials are presented along with the spectral flight data. Possible degradation and effects mechanisms will be discussed to better understand and predict the behavior of these materials in the LEO space environment...|$|R
40|$|Prevention, not reaction, is {{normally}} {{recognized as one}} of the best defense strategy against malicious hackers or attackers. The desire of deploying better prevention mechanism motivated many security researchers and practitioners to develop a threat <b>trend</b> <b>analysis</b> model. However, threat trend is not directly revealed from the time-series data because it {{is normally}} implicit in its nature. Besides, traditional time-series analysis, which predicts the future trend pattern by relying exclusively on the past trend pattern, is not appropriate for predicting a trend pattern in the dynamic network environment. Thus, supplemental environment information is required to discover a trend pattern from the implicit (or hidden) raw data.
