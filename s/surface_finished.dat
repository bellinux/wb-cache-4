The quality of <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> was studied at various cutting parameters and at the two extreme stages of the machining process, i. e. {{at the beginning and}} end of the process. The objective is to evaluate the effect of a worn-out tool on the quality of <b>surface</b> <b>finish.</b> PVD-coated carbide tools were used in this study. Experiments were conducted at two cutting speeds, 35 and 55 m/min, two depths of cut, 0. 2 and 0. 25 mm, and a constant pitch of 2. 0 mm. The tool wear and the quality of <b>surface</b> <b>finish</b> were inspected visually by microscope. The tool’s flank wear was measured gradually and machining was stopped when the flank wear reached the rejection criterion of 0. 3 mm. The microstructure beneath the machined surface was also evaluated.
