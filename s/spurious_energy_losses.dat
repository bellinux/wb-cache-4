40|$|Seismic {{interferometry}} is {{a relatively}} new technique to estimate the Green 2 ̆ 7 s function between receivers. <b>Spurious</b> <b>energy,</b> not part of the true Green 2 ̆ 7 s function, is produced because assumptions are commonly violated when applying seismic interferometry to field data. Instead of attempting to suppress all <b>spurious</b> <b>energy,</b> we show how <b>spurious</b> <b>energy</b> associated with refractions contains information about the subsurface in field data collected at the Boise Hydrogeophysical Research Site. By forming a virtual shot record we suppress uncorrelated noise and produce a virtual refraction that intercepts zero offset at zero time. These two features make the virtual refraction easy to pick, providing an estimate of refractor velocity. To obtain the physical parameters of the layer above the refractor we analyse the cross-correlation of wavefields recorded at two receivers for all sources. A stationary-phase point associated with the correlation between the reflected wave and refracted wave from the interface identifies the critical offset. By combining information from the virtual shot record, the correlation gather and the real shot record we determine the seismic velocities of the unsaturated and saturated sands, as well as the variable relative depth to the water-table.

40|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>loss</b> {{from the}} {{translational}} motion of an atom or molecule impinging {{on a metal}} surface to the surface may determine whether the incident particle can trap on the surface, and whether it has enough energy left to react with another molecule present at the surface. Although this is relevant to heterogeneous catalysis, the relative extent to which <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> of hot atoms takes place to phonons or electron-hole pair (ehp) excitation, and its dependence on the system's parameters, remain largely unknown. We address these questions for two systems that present an extreme case of the mass ratio of the incident atom to the surface atom, i. e., H + Cu(111) and H + Au(111), by presenting adiabatic ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) predictions of the <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> and angular distributions for an incidence energy of 5 eV. The results are compared {{to the results of}} AIMDEFp calculations modeling <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> to ehp excitation using an electronic friction (“EF”) model applied to the AIMD trajectories, so that the <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> to the electrons is calculated “post” (“p”) the computation of the AIMD trajectory. The AIMD calculations predict average <b>energy</b> <b>losses</b> of 0. 38 eV for Cu(111) and 0. 13 - 0. 14 eV for Au(111) for H-atoms that scatter from these surfaces without penetrating the surface. These energies closely correspond with <b>energy</b> <b>losses</b> predicted with Baule models, which is suggestive of structure scattering. The predicted adiabatic integral <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> spectra (integrated over all final scattering angles) all display a lowest energy peak at an energy corresponding to approximately 80 % of the average adiabatic <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> for non-penetrative scattering. In the adiabatic limit, this suggests a way of determining the approximate average <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> of non-penetratively scattered H-atoms from the integral <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> spectrum of all scattered H-atoms. The AIMDEFp calculations predict that in each case the lowest <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> peak should show additional <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> in the range 0. 2 - 0. 3 eV due to ehp excitation, which should be possible to observe. The average non-adiabatic <b>energy</b> <b>losses</b> for non-penetrative scattering exceed the adiabatic losses to phonons by 0. 9 - 1. 0 eV. This suggests that for scattering of hyperthermal H-atoms from coinage metals the dominant energy dissipation channel should be to ehp excitation.

We aimed to correlate <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> with ascending aortic aneurysm size and histopathologic findings to elucidate the pathophysiology of aneurysm complications. MethodsAneurysmal ascending aortic specimens were obtained during surgery. Control specimens were obtained from autopsy and organ donors. Biaxial tensile tests were performed on the 4 quadrants of the aortic ring. <b>Energy</b> <b>loss</b> was calculated using the integral of the stress–strain curve during loading and unloading. It was compared with the size and the traditional biomechanical parameter, stiffness (apparent modulus of elasticity). Elastin, collagen, and mucopolysaccharide content were quantified using Movat pentachrome staining of histology slides. ResultsA total of 41 aortas were collected (34 aneurysmal, 7 control). The aneurysms exhibited increased stiffness (P < . 0001) and <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> (P < . 0001) compared with the controls. <b>Energy</b> <b>loss</b> correlated significantly with aortic size (P < . 0001, r 2  = . 60). A hinge point was noted at a diameter of 5. 5 cm, after which <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> increased rapidly. The relationship between <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> and size became strongly linear once the size was indexed to the body surface area (P < . 0001, r 2  = . 78). <b>Energy</b> <b>loss</b> correlated with the histopathologic findings, especially the collagen/elastin ratio (P = . 0002, r 2  = . 49).

40|$|AbstractTurbo-generator shafts {{are often}} {{subjected}} to complex dynamic torsional loadings, resulting in generation and propagation of circumferential cracks. Mode III fatigue crack growth generally {{results in a}} fracture surface consisting of peaks and valleys, resembling a factory roof. The fracture surface roughness depends on the material microstructure, the material yield strength, and the applied cyclic torque amplitude. This crack pattern can severely affect the vibration characteristics of the shafts. The accurate evaluation of the torsional dynamic response of the turbo-generator shafts entails considering the local sources of <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> in the crack vicinity. The two most common sources of the <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> are the local <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> due to the plasticity at the crack tip and frictional <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> due to interaction of mutual crack surfaces. A theoretical procedure for evaluating {{the values of the}} system loss factors corresponding to these sources of <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> is presented. Furthermore, the local flexibility is obtained by evaluating the resistance of the cracked section of the shaft to the rotational displacement.

40|$|Electronic {{friction}} {{and the ensuing}} nonadiabatic <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> {{play an important role}} in chemical reaction dynamics at metal surfaces. Using molecular dynamics with electronic friction evaluated on the fly from density functional theory, we find strong mode dependence and a dominance of nonadiabatic <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> along the bond stretch coordinate for scattering and dissociative chemisorption of H 2 on the Ag(111) surface. Exemplary trajectories with varying initial conditions indicate that this mode specificity translates into modulated <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> during a dissociative chemisorption event.

40|$|The Weinberg-Salam {{model is}} applied to {{quantify}} the <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> of antineutrinos and neutrinos encountering polymers. The scattering cross-sectional energy due to encounters with electrons is calculated, along with the probability that an antineutrino will remain the same particle. The <b>energy</b> <b>loss</b> reaches a maximum, i. e., stopping occurs, when the probability is unity. The technique {{is applied to}} study the <b>energy</b> <b>losses</b> in kapton, a solid organic insulator used for antennas on spacecraft exposed to solar neutrinos with energies ranging from 0. 5 - 10 MeV.
