5|$|Moveable sails: By {{the time}} of the Zhou Dynasty ship {{technologies}} such as stern mounted rudders were developed, and by the Han Dynasty, a well kept naval fleet {{was an integral part of}} the military. The Chinese used the complex moving technology behind the kite allowed then to develop the worlds first moving <b>sails</b> (in comparison with the mounted <b>sails</b> used in the West) around 200 AD. These moving <b>sails</b> allowed ships to sail into the wind for the first time in human history. Civilizations around the world soon emulated the Chinese technology and eventually moving <b>sails</b> became the standard on ships.|$|E
5|$|Although {{only the}} lower {{fittings}} of the rigging survives, a 1514 inventory {{and the only}} known contemporary depiction of the ship from the Anthony Roll {{have been used to}} determine how the propulsion system of the Mary Rose was designed. Nine, or possibly ten, <b>sails</b> were flown from four masts and a bowsprit: the foremast and mainmast had two and three square <b>sails</b> respectively; the mizzen mast had a lateen sail and a small square sail and the bonaventure mizzen had at least one lateen sail, and possibly also a square sail, and the bowsprit flew a small square spritsail. According to the Anthony Roll illustration (see top of this section), the yards (the spars from which the <b>sails</b> were set) on the foremast and mainmast were also equipped with sheerhooks, twin curved blades sharpened on the inside, that were intended to cut an enemy ship's rigging during boarding actions.|$|E

5|$|Around noon, as {{a result}} of poor {{coordination}} and signaling, the Swedish line unexpectedly turned toward the allied fleet. When the flagship Kronan came about in the maneuver it suddenly heeled over and began to take in water. According to master gunner Anders Gyllenspak, the <b>sails</b> were not reefed and the ship leaned over so hard that water flooded in through the lower gunports. As the ship was leaning over, a gust of wind pushed the ship on her side, bringing her masts and <b>sails</b> down in line with the surface of the sea. Shortly afterwards, the gunpowder store exploded and ripped the forward section of the starboard side apart. Kronan quickly lost buoyancy and sank, taking most of her 850-man crew with her.|$|E
5|$|As {{pointed out}} by Jack Bailey (1997), the spines resembled those of sail-bearing pelycosaurs like Dimetrodon. According to Bailey, Amargasaurus might also have possessed such a sail, {{which might have been}} used for display. Unlike those of pelycosaurs, the neural spines of Amargasaurus were bifurcated, forming a double row along the neck and back. As the space between both rows was merely , the {{existence}} of two parallel <b>sails</b> seems unlikely. Instead, Bailey suggested the spines represented a scaffold which was completely enveloped by a single skin. Paul argued against the sail hypothesis, noting that neck <b>sails</b> would have reduced neck flexion, and that the spines were circular in cross-section rather than flattened {{as is the case in}} sail-bearing animals.|$|E
5|$|At 21:30 Forte and the {{captured}} merchant ships were visible from Sybille, Forte brilliantly illuminated {{in the tropical}} night. Cooke brought Sybille westwards {{in order to take}} the weather gage before wearing and bearing down on the French ship, under a light wind from the southwest. Despite the illumination on the French ship, Sybilles <b>sails</b> were clearly identified on Forte but Beaulieu gave no orders to prepare for action: he seems to have thought that the <b>sails</b> belonged to an approaching East Indiaman despite the concerns of his officers, or that he wished to lure Sybille close enough to ensure its defeat in the coming engagement.|$|E

5|$|In 2009 the <b>sails</b> were {{replaced}} and the mill re-thatched and restored by local craftsmen {{at a cost}} of a £100,000; the mill was re-opened later that year. The work was funded by the Grantscape Community Heritage Fund. Although the <b>sails</b> do not rotate with the wind, they are moved 90 degrees four times per year for maintenance. Before the restoration work was undertaken surveys revealed that the mill was used as a roost for long-eared and lesser horseshoe bats. It was ensured that the bats would still have access after the restoration.|$|E

5|$|The first udema {{was built}} in 1760 and had two masts (mainmast and foremast) that were {{originally}} rigged with lateen <b>sails.</b> It was later provided with a square sail rig {{similar to that of}} a polacca bark without topgallant <b>sails.</b> It had a low hull with a small quarterdeck structure and an arrangement of guns that was unique for its time. Its main armament consisted of a single line of eight 12-pound guns along the centerline of the ship and two 12-pounders in the bow facing forwards. The centerline guns used pivoting carriages that could be rotated 360 degrees and aimed to either side of the ship, similar to the main guns of the dreadnought battleships of the 20th century.|$|E

50|$|To {{catch the}} energy, Forward used a 1,000-km-diameter, {{circular}} aluminum <b>sail.</b> The <b>sail</b> resembled a flattened disk with a 300-km diameter removable center portion. When traveling to Rocheworld, the entire <b>sail</b> was used. When the ship needed to decelerate, the smaller <b>sail</b> {{was separated from}} the larger outer <b>sail.</b> The large <b>sail</b> {{was used as a}} reflecting lens, focusing light onto the smaller <b>sail,</b> slowing the craft.|$|R
5|$|American forces boarded Diana {{and rapidly}} removed {{everything}} of value, including guns, rigging, <b>sails,</b> clothing, and money. They laid hay under the stern {{to serve as}} kindling, and the vessel was set on fire at about 3 am {{to prevent it from}} falling back into British hands. The guns recovered were probably used in the American positions during the Battle of Bunker Hill.|$|E
5|$|As coal was {{extremely}} expensive on the West Coast of the Americas, HMS Zealous generally used her <b>sails</b> and covered more miles under sail {{than any of}} the other Victorian sailing ironclads, and in her whole career never once travelled in company with another ironclad. She was also the first British ironclad to sail further from Britain than the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|At 10:00, Soleil {{accepted}} that his remaining ships would rapidly be overhauled by Monarch and drew them together, forming a compact group {{with which to}} receive the British attack. He also ordered his captains to focus their fire on the enemy <b>sails,</b> rigging and masts, hoping to inflict enough damage to delay the pursuit and allow his force to escape. Within minutes Monarch was heavily engaged with Armide and Minerve but Captain Lee found himself at a disadvantage: the heavy swell that had suited his ship during the chase also prevented him from opening his lower gunports in case of flooding. This halved his available cannon {{and as a result}} his isolated ship began to suffer severe damage to its rigging and <b>sails</b> from the frigates' gunnery. Within 20 minutes, Monarch was unable to manoeuvree, but Lee continued fighting until Centaur could reach the melee, the flagship opening fire at 11:00. Hood passed the battling Monarch and Minerve, concentrating his fire on Armide and the flagship Gloire. For another 45 minutes the battle continued, Centaur suffering damage to her rigging and <b>sails</b> from the French shot and taking casualties from musket fire from the soldiers carried aboard. Among the wounded was Commodore Hood, who was shot in the right forearm, the ball eventually lodging in his shoulder. Hood retired below and command passed to his second in command, Lieutenant Case.|$|E

5|$|Elaborate body {{structures}} of many modern-day animals usually serve to attract {{members of the}} opposite sex during mating.

5|$|Firing {{began at}} 15:29 when Prudente {{unleashed}} a close range broadside at Centurion, followed immediately by {{fire from the}} ships of both sides. Centurion was damaged in the opening exchanges and by 16:00 had most of her <b>sails</b> and rigging torn. At this Renaud ordered his squadron to pull back to leeward out of range, each firing on Centurion as they passed.|$|E
5|$|For {{additional}} maneuverability, the udema carried 14 to 18 {{pairs of}} oars.
