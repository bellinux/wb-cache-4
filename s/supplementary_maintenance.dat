40|$|The Texas Southern University {{case study}} {{describes}} an innovative conceptual approach to comprehensive energy management involving {{an agreement with}} a qualified energy services company to install a building automation system (BAS) and energy conservation measures (ECMs) campus wide and provide staff training, <b>supplementary</b> <b>maintenance</b> and guarantees of savings achieved. This is accomplished through a three-stage process of qualification, preliminary selection, and contract negotiation. TSU's approach relies on the service company to provide the engineering, but uses an oversight engineer to provide project integrity. In TSU's case, financing was not required and <b>supplementary</b> <b>maintenance</b> has been rebid.

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} anaesthesia on circulatory physiology and their implications regarding improvement in perioperative anaesthetic management. Changes to current anaesthetic practice, recommended recently, {{such as the use}} of flow monitoring in high risk patients, are already beginning to have an impact in reducing complications but not mortality [1]. Better understanding of the patho-physiology should help improve management even further. Analysis of selected individual clinical trials has been used to illustrate particular areas of patho-physiology and how changes in practice have improved outcome. There is physiological support for the importance of achieving an appropriate rate of oxygen delivery (DO 2), particularly following induction of anaesthesia. It is suggested that ensuring adequate DO 2 during anaesthesia will avoid development of oxygen debt and hence obviate the need to induce a high, compensatory, DO 2 in the post-operative period. In contrast to the usual assumptions underlying strategies requiring a global increase in blood flow [1] by a stroke volume near maximization strategy, blood flow control actually resides entirely at the tissues not at the heart. This is important as the starting point for understanding failed circulatory control as indicated by ‘volume dependency’. Local adjustments in blood flow at each individual organ – auto-regulation – normally ensure the appropriate local rate of oxygen supply, i. e. local DO 2. Inadequate blood volume leads to impairment of the regulation of blood flow, particularly in the individual tissues with least capable auto-regulatory capability. As demonstrated by many studies, inadequate blood flow first occurs in the gut, brain and kidney. The inadequate blood volume which occurs with induction of anaesthesia is not due to blood volume loss, but probably results from redistribution due to veno-dilation. The increase in venous capacity renders the existing blood volume inadequate to maintain venous return and pre-load. Blood volume shifted to the veins will, necessarily, also reduce the arterial volume. As a result stroke volume and cardiac output fall below normal with little or no change in peripheral resistance. The resulting pre-load dependency is often successfully treated with colloid infusion and, in some studies, ‘inotropic’ agents, particularly in the immediate post-operative phase. Treatment during the earliest stage of anaesthesia can avoid the build up of oxygen debt and may be supplemented by drugs which maintain or restore venous tone, such as phenylephrine; an alternative to volume expansion. Interpretation of circulatory patho-physiology during anaesthesia confirms the need to sustain appropriate oxygen delivery. It also supports reduction or even elimination of <b>supplementary</b> crystalloid <b>maintenance</b> infusion, supposedly to replace the “mythical” third space loss. As a rational evidence base for future research it should allow for further improvements in anaesthetic management...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 35 herds of cattle from 2 inistitutional farms, and 6 privately-owned farms which were semi-intensively managed, and 17 nomadic Fulani herds were studied between January 1984 and December 1993 to {{evaluate}} the age of first calving (AFC) in the three major indigenous breeds of the Savannah zone of Northern Nigeria: the White-fulani (bunaji), Sokoto-Gudali (Bokoloji) and red Fulani (Rahaji). The AFC of heifers at first calving ranged from 30 to 42 months (mean, 37 ± 0. 57 months) with no breed differences. The AFC of heifers from Semi-intensively managed herds (institutional and privately-owned farms) was 30 to 40 months (mean, 36 ± 1. 05 months) and that from nomadic herds was 33 to 42 months (mean, 37 ± 1. 31 months). The much lower AFC range observed in this studycompared to the highervalues (33 – 60 months) reported by pervious investigators {{is due to the}} increased awareness of livestock owners for the need to improve feed supplementation for livestock in particular during the dry season. The nomadic herdsmen ensure a ready supply of cereal bran, cotton seed (meal or cake) crop residues such as groundnut and bean hulls, corn stalks in addition to salt (mineral) licks during the harsh dry season. Institutional and private herds are provided with legumes and grass silages and hay in addition to cereal bran, cotton seed meal and salt licks during the dry season. Nomadic herdowners now realize the importance of <b>supplementary</b> feeding and <b>maintenance</b> of good herd health in the prevention of malnutrition and diseases. This results in a consistent improvement in growth and productivity as evidenced by the lower AFC values observed in this study...|$|R
40|$|Context: Anganwadi worker (AWW) is an {{important}} functionary in integrated child development scheme (ICDS). Aim: To study perceived responsibilities, workload, operational difficulties, and satisfaction level of AWWs. Materials and Methods: Prospective observational cross-sectional study of 66 AWWs using a pre-designed proforma: Analysis using Statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 11. 5. Results: Pre-school education, house visits, records-keeping were perceived as important activities by 92. 4 %, 60. 6 %, and 57. 6 %, respectively, growth monitoring and immunization by 3 % and 4. 5 %, respectively; 51. 5 % did not have adequate time for duties, and 74. 2 % were doing non-ICDS duties. Heavy workload was the major perceived operational difficulty for 66. 7 % of the respondents. Timely supplementary food was available as per 92. 4 %. Inadequacies in equipments, workspace, training, and staffing were noted by 47 %, 18. 2 %, 7. 6 %, 7. 6 %, respectively. No operational difficulties were seen by 10. 6 %. Induction job training was provided to 36 (54. 5 %), and 17 / 66 (25. 8 %) felt they were inadequately trained despite yearly refresher courses. Dissatisfaction with monthly honorarium, availability of equipment, <b>supplementary</b> food, and <b>maintenance</b> of registries was reported by 89. 4 %, 53 %, 54. 6 %, and 43. 9 %, respectively. Despite this, 62. 1 % (40 / 66) were satisfied. Conclusions: Supplementary nutrition, growth monitoring, and immunization of children along with health education though being primary duties were given less emphasis. Heavy workload was the major perceived operational difficulty. Adequate staff, workspace, equipments, timely monthly honorarium should be provided along with training and avoidance of non-ICDS duties would help in achieving the objectives of ICDS...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Listeria monocytogenes is an {{important}} food-borne pathogen and model organism for host-pathogen interaction, thus representing an invaluable target considering research on the forces governing the evolution of such microbes. The diversity of this species has not been exhaustively explored yet, as previous efforts have focused on analyses of serotypes primarily implicated in human listeriosis. We conducted complete genome sequencing of 11 strains employing 454 GS FLX technology, thereby achieving full coverage of all serotypes including the first complete strains of serotypes 1 / 2 b, 3 c, 3 b, 4 c, 4 d, and 4 e. These were comparatively analyzed in conjunction with publicly available data and assessed for pathogenicity in the Galleria mellonella insect model. Results The species pan-genome of L. monocytogenes is highly stable but open, suggesting an ability to adapt to new niches by generating or including new genetic information. The majority of gene-scale differences represented by the accessory genome resulted from nine hyper variable hotspots, a similar number of different prophages, three transposons (Tn 916, Tn 554, IS 3 -like), and two mobilizable islands. Only a subset of strains showed CRISPR/Cas bacteriophage resistance systems of different subtypes, suggesting a <b>supplementary</b> function in <b>maintenance</b> of chromosomal stability. Multiple phylogenetic branches of the genus Listeria imply long common histories of strains of each lineage as revealed by a SNP-based core genome tree highlighting the impact of small mutations {{for the evolution of}} species L. monocytogenes. Frequent loss or truncation of genes described to be vital for virulence or pathogenicity was confirmed as a recurring pattern, especially for strains belonging to lineages III and II. New candidate genes implicated in virulence function were predicted based on functional domains and phylogenetic distribution. A comparative analysis of small regulatory RNA candidates supports observations of a differential distribution of trans -encoded RNA, hinting at a diverse range of adaptations and regulatory impact. Conclusions This study determined commonly occurring hyper variable hotspots and mobile elements as primary effectors of quantitative gene-scale evolution of species L. monocytogenes, while gene decay and SNPs seem to represent major factors influencing long-term evolution. The discovery of common and disparately distributed genes considering lineages, serogroups, serotypes and strains of species L. monocytogenes will assist in diagnostic, phylogenetic and functional research, supported by the comparative genomic GECO-LisDB analysis server ([URL]). </p...|$|R
