5|$|The phylum has a {{wide range}} of body forms, {{including}} the flattened, deep-sea platyctenids, in which the adults of most species lack combs, and the coastal beroids, which lack tentacles and prey on other ctenophores by using huge mouths armed with groups of large, stiffened cilia that act as teeth. Almost all ctenophores are predators, taking prey ranging from microscopic larvae and rotifers to the adults of small crustaceans; the exceptions are juveniles of two species, which live as parasites on the <b>salps</b> on which adults of their species feed. Most species are hermaphrodites, and juveniles of at least some species are capable of reproduction before reaching the adult size and shape. This combination of hermaphroditism and early reproduction enables small populations to grow at an explosive rate.|$|E

The lateral line system on its underside allows it to detect the minute water jets produced by buried bivalves and spoon worms, which are then extracted via suction; the excess water is expelled through the spiracles. Fishes and invertebrates from open water, including <b>salps</b> and hyperiid amphipods, are also eaten in significant quantities. Off South Africa, this ray has been observed patrolling the egg beds of the chokka squid (Loligo vulgaris reynaudii) during mass spawnings, capturing squid that descend to the bottom to spawn.

40|$|Lyme {{disease is}} the most {{prevalent}} vector-borne disease in the United States. Lyme disease is mediated by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted by Ixodes scapularis ticks. Recently, critical protein-protein interactions responsible for the unique host:vector:pathogen symbiosis have been identified. A key protein involved in both transmission and persistence of the spirochete is the antigenic tick salivary protein <b>Salp</b> 15. <b>Salp</b> 15 {{has been shown to}} be important in host immunosuppression by interaction with the CD 4 glycoprotein as well as spirochete protection by interaction with a bacterial outer surface protein, OspC. Although these critical protein-protein interactions have been identified, a more in-depth biophysical analysis is lacking. To better understand the mechanism of action of these proteins, we have studied the interaction of <b>Salp</b> 15 with CD 4 and OspC using a variety of biochemical techniques. ^ We have isolated two forms of <b>Salp</b> 15, monomeric and dimeric <b>Salp</b> 15. The binding interaction of <b>Salp</b> 15 with CD 4 is only observed with D-Salp 15. D-Salp 15 is a disulfide mediated multimer of <b>Salp</b> 15. Additionally, we do not observe a direct interaction between <b>Salp</b> 15 and OspC in our experimental procedures, perhaps due to the oligomeric state of <b>Salp</b> 15. The protein-protein interaction experiments have significantly contributed to the understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of Lyme disease and warrant further structural investigation. The isolation and characterization of the active form of <b>Salp</b> 15 is the first step in creation of potential factors to modulate immune responses.

40|$|SummaryTraditionally, {{vaccines}} directly {{target a}} pathogen or microbial toxin. Lyme disease, caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, is a tick-borne illness {{for which a}} human vaccine is not currently available. B. burgdorferi binds a tick salivary protein, <b>Salp</b> 15, during transmission from the vector, and this interaction facilitates infection of mice. We now show that <b>Salp</b> 15 antiserum significantly protected mice from B. burgdorferi infection. <b>Salp</b> 15 antiserum also markedly enhanced the protective capacity of antibodies against B. burgdorferi antigens, such as OspA or OspC. Mice actively immunized with <b>Salp</b> 15 were also significantly protected from tick-borne Borrelia. In vitro assays showed that <b>Salp</b> 15 antiserum increased the clearance of <b>Salp</b> 15 -coated B. burgdorferi by phagocytes, suggesting a mechanism of action. Vaccination with a vector molecule that a microbe requires for infection of the mammalian host suggests a new strategy {{for the prevention of}} Lyme disease, and this paradigm may be applicable to numerous arthropod-borne pathogens of medical importance...|$|R

40|$|AbstractTicks {{transmit}} numerous pathogens, including borreliae, {{which cause}} Lyme disease. Tick saliva contains a complex mix of anti-host defense factors, including the immunosuppressive cysteine-rich secretory glycoprotein <b>Salp</b> 15 from Ixodes scapularis ticks and orthologs like Iric- 1 from Ixodes ricinus. All tick-borne microbes {{benefit from the}} immunosuppression at the tick bite site; in addition, borreliae exploit the binding of <b>Salp</b> 15 to their outer surface protein C (OspC) for enhanced transmission. Hence, <b>Salp</b> 15 proteins are attractive targets for anti-tick vaccines that also target borreliae. However, recombinant <b>Salp</b> proteins are not accessible in sufficient quantity for either vaccine manufacturing or for structural characterization. As an alternative to low-yield eukaryotic systems, we investigated cytoplasmic expression in Escherichia coli, even though this would not result in glycosylation. His-tagged <b>Salp</b> 15 was efficiently expressed but insoluble. Among the various solubility-enhancing protein tags tested, DsbA was superior, yielding milligram amounts of soluble, monomeric <b>Salp</b> 15 and Iric- 1 fusions. Easily accessible mutants enabled epitope mapping of two monoclonal antibodies that, importantly, cross-react with glycosylated <b>Salp</b> 15, and revealed interaction sites with OspC. Free <b>Salp</b> 15 and Iric- 1 from protease-cleavable fusions, despite limited solubility, allowed the recording of 1 H‚Äì 15 N 2 D NMR spectra, suggesting partial folding of the wild-type proteins but not of Cys-free variants. Fusion to the NMR-compatible GB 1 domain sufficiently enhanced solubility to reveal first secondary structure elements in 13 C/ 15 N double-labeled Iric- 1. Together, E. coli expression of appropriately fused <b>Salp</b> 15 proteins may be highly valuable for the molecular characterization of the function and eventually the 3 D structure of these medically relevant tick proteins...|$|R

Sera from sensitized guinea pigs strongly recognized 3 of 4, 500 library clones in an initial screening. The open reading frames of all 3 clones encoded a putative 16. 4 -kD acidic protein, designated <b>Salp</b> 16, with an N-terminal signal sequence and signal peptidase cleavage sites specific for secretory proteins. The <b>salp</b> 16 mRNA and <b>Salp</b> 16 protein were detected in the salivary glands of engorged, but not unfed, nymphal and adult ticks, and <b>Salp</b> 16 was {{also found in the}} saliva of engorged ticks. Immunization with recombinant <b>Salp</b> 16 induced high antibody titers in guinea pigs, but did not elicit tick-immunity. <b>Salp</b> 16 is the first feeding inducible gene that has been cloned from I. scapularis. Molecular characterization of I. scapularis salivary antigens that are induced upon tick feeding should help to facilitate our understanding of tick-host interactions. Ticks are important vectors of a variety of medically sig-nificant bacterial, protozoan, and viral diseases. To help fa-cilitate attachment and engorgement, ticks produce biologi-cally active components with anti-hemostatic, anti-inflam...|$|R

We now describe a feeding-inducible protein in Ixodes scapularis saliva, <b>Salp</b> 15, that inhibits CD 4 + T cell activation. The mechanism involves the repression of calcium fluxes triggered by TCR ligation and results in lower production of interleukin- 2. <b>Salp</b> 15 also inhibits the development of CD 4 + T cell-mediated immune responses in vivo, demonstrating the functional importance of this protein. <b>Salp</b> 15 provides a molecular basis for understanding the immunosuppressive activity of I. scapularis saliva and vector-host interactions...|$|R
