25|$|Anne Stanhope, Somerset's proud wife, disliked Catherine and Thomas {{and began}} to turn many people in court against them. To {{demonstrate}} her hatred, Anne kept the Queen's jewels, which by right were Catherine's. In turn, Catherine was annoyed at the appointment of Edward Seymour (Duke of Somerset) as Protector regent, since as King Edward's stepmother, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> to be appointed regent.|$|E
60|$|His quiet answer {{threw her}} off her balance. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> no more <b>expected</b> an answer than does a preacher when he exclaims from the pulpit, 'Do {{you feel your}} sin?' <b>She</b> <b>had</b> clearly <b>expected</b> a sudden alarm.|$|R

25|$|The Court overrules him, {{stating that}} more torture {{should be applied}} until the truth is spoken. Again, Filippo changes his mind and {{supports}} the Court's decision. Agnese pleads with Filppo for Beatrice and Orombello, confessing her own behaviour in defaming them. The couple is led away, with Filippo and Agnese, full of remorse, left alone. She realises that things have gone much further than <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> and begs Filippo to drop all the charges. However, not wishing to look weak, he dismisses the idea and orders her to leave.|$|E
25|$|On 16 August, after {{receiving}} a first-round bye at the Tier I Rogers Cup in Montreal, Clijsters faced Canadian Stéphanie Dubois in the second round. Having won the first set 6–1 and trailing 2–3 in the second set, Clijsters slipped and fell on her left wrist {{and was forced to}} retire from the match. On 18 August 2006, Clijsters announced on her official website that the condition of her wrist was worse than <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> and that she would be unable to defend her title at the US Open. She also missed the Fed Cup final against Italy, which Italy won 3–2.|$|E
25|$|Louisa Ulrika could, however, never settle {{with the}} {{position}} of queen dowager. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> {{to be the real}} ruler behind the throne, and when her son {{made it clear that he}} would rule independently from her, their relationship worsened. In 1772, he prevented her plans to marry off her second son Charles to Philippine of Brandenburg-Schwedt, and in 1774, Charles was married to Hedwig Elizabeth Charlotte of Holstein-Gottorp instead. Gustav III paid her debts with the condition that she established her own separate court at Fredrikshof Palace. In 1777, she was forced to sell Drottningholm Palace to her son Gustav.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, she co-starred {{opposite}} Orlando Bloom in Cameron Crowe's romantic tragicomedy Elizabethtown as Claire Colburn, {{a flight}} attendant. The film premiered at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival. Dunst revealed that working with Crowe was enjoyable, but more demanding than <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected.</b> The movie garnered mixed reviews, with the Chicago Tribune rating it {{one out of}} four stars and describing Dunst's portrayal of a flight attendant as [...] "cloying." [...] It was a box office disappointment.|$|E
500|$|Stone {{supported}} the amendment. [...] <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected,</b> however, that progressive forces would {{push for the}} enfranchisment of African Americans and women {{at the same time}} and was distressed when they did not. [...] In 1867, she wrote to Abby Kelley Foster, an abolitionist, to protest the plan to enfranchise black men first. [...] "O Abby", she wrote, [...] "it is a terrible mistake you are all making... There is no other name given by which this country can be saved, but that of woman." ...|$|E
500|$|The censors {{ended up}} pulling [...] "I'll See You in Court", {{preventing}} it from airing in the United States during the series' original run. Terry Rakolta, a political activist from Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, had launched a letter-writing {{campaign against the}} program after viewing the Season 3 episode [...] "Her Cups Runneth Over" [...] in January 1989. Offended by the episode's content, she urged advertisers to boycott the show, several of whom did or pledged to more carefully screen the episodes for which they provided advertising. The campaign garnered more media attention than <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> and the advertisers' more careful scrutiny of the individual episodes that they supported was a significant factor {{that led to the}} pulling of [...] "I'll See You in Court". [...] Contributing to this was that the overall topic, sex, was not seen as a topic to be vocally and openly discussed on television.|$|E

500|$|On 24 July 1999, Climbié {{was taken}} by Kouao to the accident-and-emergency {{department}} at North Middlesex Hospital with severe scalding to her head and other injuries. The hospital {{found no evidence of}} scabies. Consultant Mary Rossiter felt Climbié was being abused but still wrote 'able to discharge' on her notes. According to Maureen Ann Meates, another doctor at the hospital, when Rossiter had written that note, she had noted that Climbié was exhibiting signs of neglect, emotional abuse and physical abuse. Later, in the inquiry, Rossiter said that by writing 'able to discharge', she did not mean she wanted Climbié to go home, merely that she was physically fit to leave. Garnham said, [...] "quite how the subtlety of that distinction was to be ascertained from the notes is far from obvious". Rossiter admitted to the inquiry that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> police and social services to follow up on the case. For a brief period while Climbié was in hospital, Enfield social services took up the case before passing it to Haringey.|$|E
500|$|Kai Owen {{describes}} Thomas, Morgan and Hughes collectively with Robin Griffith (Barry Williams) as a [...] "good old-fashioned Welsh cast {{who know}} what it's all about". Jonathan Lewis Owen was cast as Rhys' best man [...] "Banana Boat" [...] a character referred to sporadically since Torchwoods first series premiere [...] "Everything Changes" [...] (2006). In keeping with the character's name {{he was given a}} pair of banana patterned cuff links to compliment his costume. As a joke, Eve Myles (who Jonathan Owen had previously worked with in other projects) left a banana skin on his car on his first day of filming. Collette Brown played [...] "Carrie", the original human form of the mother Nostrovite. To transform her into the alien creature the actress was required to spend approximately an hour having make-up applied. Brown was surprised at the efficiency of the make-up artists as <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> the transformation process to take longer. Originally, the human versions of the Nostrovite shapeshifter were intended to be more monstrous but Davies felt it was important that the audience would still be able to recognise the actor underneath once the make up had been applied.|$|E
500|$|In 1984, {{she entered}} private practice, joining the {{commercial}} litigation practice group of Pavia & Harcourt in Manhattan as an associate. One of 30 attorneys {{in the law}} firm, she specialized in intellectual property litigation, international law, and arbitration. [...] She later said, [...] "I wanted to complete myself as an attorney." [...] Although she had no civil litigation experience, the firm recruited her heavily, and she learned quickly on the job. [...] She was eager to try cases and argue in court, rather than {{be part of a}} larger law firm. Her clients were mostly international corporations doing business in the United States; much of her time was spent tracking down and suing counterfeiters of Fendi goods. In some cases, Sotomayor went on-site with the police to Harlem or Chinatown to have illegitimate merchandise seized, in the latter instance pursuing a fleeing culprit while riding on a motorcycle. She said at the time that Pavia & Harcourt's efforts were run [...] "much like a drug operation", and the successful rounding up of thousands of counterfeit accessories in 1986 was celebrated by [...] "Fendi Crush", a destruction-by-garbage-truck event at Tavern on the Green. At other times, she dealt with dry legal issues such as grain export contract disputes. In a 1986 appearance on Good Morning America that profiled women ten years after college graduation, she said that the bulk of law work was drudgery, and that while she was content with her life, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> greater things of herself coming out of college. [...] In 1988 she became a partner at the firm; she was paid well but not extravagantly. She left in 1992 when she became a judge.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed {{over a number}} of afternoons at the end of 2007, with each day's filming {{beginning}} with a repeat of the last section from the previous day, to help blend each scene into the next. It was filmed with a [...] "single camera mentality" [...] but with up to five cameras running to give Brown a [...] "freedom of performance away from hitting marks or favouring one particular camera position." [...] This also helped in the case of technical problems, meaning that second takes were not necessary. Brown cried when she read the script and though she did not cry during fiming, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> to, planning to pause the tape recorder if she did. She stated that {{the most difficult part of}} the script was the line about Jim being [...] "here, but not here" [...] because she felt that way about Bardon. Arnold admitted to [...] " [...] away the tears" [...] many times and noted that several other crew cried, and that one of the toughest things about it was that it mirrored real-life events. Brown found the episode easy to film due to the fact there were no other cast members to make mistakes, and because she [...] "knew the character backwards" [...] and [...] "exactly how she'd behave and what she'd feel and [...] her history." [...] She praised Arnold and the crew, stating that the episode was [...] "lovely" [...] to make and she felt [...] "very fortunate to be given the opportunity." [...] The performance was edited in post production after being committed to tape, where usually all scenes are vision mixed, and the usual EastEnders theme tune was replaced at the end of the episode with Tony Jackson's [...] "Pretty Baby".|$|E
2500|$|Her third {{husband was}} John C. Heenan, a popular Irish-American prizefighter whom she married in 1859.

2500|$|A 2003 {{study of}} college {{students}} by Naomi Baron found {{that the use of}} these initialisms in computer-mediated communication (CMC), specifically in instant messaging, was actually lower than <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected.</b> The students [...] "used few abbreviations, acronyms, and emoticons". Out of 2,185 transmissions, there were 90 initialisms in total; 76 were occurrences of LOL.|$|E

2500|$|Early {{portrayal}} of the furries in magazines such as Wired, Loaded, Vanity Fair, and the syndicated sex column [...] "Savage Love" [...] focused mainly on the sexual aspect of furry fandom. Fictional portrayals of furry fandom have appeared on television shows such as ER, , The Drew Carey Show, Sex2K on MTV, Entourage, 1000 Ways to Die, Tosh.0, and 30 Rock. Most furry fans claim that these media portrayals are misconceptions, while the recent coverage focuses on debunking myths and stereotypes {{that have come to}} be associated with the furry fandom. A reporter attending Anthrocon 2006 noted that [...] "despite their wild image from Vanity Fair, MTV and CSI, furry conventions aren't about kinky sex between weirdos gussied up in foxy costumes", that conference attendees were [...] "not having sex more than the rest of us", and that the furry convention was about [...] "people talking and drawing animals and comic-book characters in sketchbooks." [...] In October 2007, a Hartford Advocate reporter attended FurFright 2007 undercover because of media restrictions. She learned that the restrictions were intended to prevent misinformation, and reported that the scandalous behavior <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> was not evident. Recent coverage of the furry fandom has been more balanced. According to Ian Wolf, a 2009 article from the BBC entitled [...] "Who are the furries?" [...] was the first piece of journalism to be nominated for an Ursa Major Award, the main awards given in the field of anthropomorphism.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the aid of}} Peter Guagenti, Fisher {{obtained}} a [...]25 caliber pistol and then went out to steal a set of license plates off a neighbourhood car. On May 19, 1992, Guagenti helped Fisher put the license plates on his Pontiac Firebird and then drove her to the Buttafuoco home in Massapequa, New York. Fisher later explained to the police that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> Guagenti {{to carry out the}} shooting, but he refused. When Mary Jo Buttafuoco answered the door, Fisher told her that Joey Buttafuoco {{was having an affair with}} Fisher's (imaginary) younger sister, providing a T-shirt advertising Buttafuoco's auto body shop for her [...] "proof." [...] The conversation lasted about 15 minutes, but Buttafuoco became increasingly angry with Fisher's claims. She finally told her to leave and then turned her back to go back into the house. Fisher then produced the gun, struck Buttafuoco in the head with it, and then aimed at her temple and fired. Buttafuoco fell to the ground, severely wounded. Fisher dropped the shirt and the gun and ran towards the car, but Guagenti told her to take the evidence with her, so she ran back to retrieve both items and then they both fled the scene. Neighbors called 911 and came to Buttafuoco's aid. She was operated on all night, and although unable to remove the bullet, the doctors were able to save her life.|$|E
2500|$|When King Edward {{heard of}} the violent {{reception}} his consort was given by Margaret, he was predictably outraged and personally mustered a sizeable force of men [...] "aged between sixteen and sixty", including at least six earls, {{to join him in}} a military expedition which he promptly led against Margaret and her garrison at Leeds Castle to avenge the grievous insult delivered to the Queen by one of his subjects. Following a relentless assault of the fortress, which persisted for more than five days and with the King's troops using ballistas, Margaret surrendered at curfew on 31 October having received a [...] "promise of mercy" [...] from Edward. Throughout the siege, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> the Earl of Lancaster to arrive with his soldiery to relieve her, but this he had refused to do; nor had any of the other Contrariants or the Marcher Lords come to her assistance, which left her to defend the castle with merely her husband's nephew, Bartholomew de Burghersh, and the garrison troops. Baron Badlesmere, although supportive of Margaret's conduct, had during that crucial time, sought refuge at Stoke Park, seat of the Bishop of Lincoln; however he did manage to despatch some knights from Witney to augment the garrison troops in the defence of Leeds. Once King Edward had gained possession of the castle and the Badlesmere treasure within, the seneschal, Walter Colepepper and 12 of the garrison were hanged from the battlements. Margaret was arrested and sent as a prisoner, along with her five children and Bartholomew de Burghersh, to the Tower of London; she therefore became the first recorded woman imprisoned in the Tower. On her journey to the fortress, she was insulted and jeered at by the citizens of London who, out of loyalty to Isabella, had followed her progression through the streets to vent their fury against the person who had dared maltreat their queen.|$|E
