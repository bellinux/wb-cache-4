5|$|Chaltin's column {{advanced}} north {{with the}} Nile river protecting his right flank and the Azande cavalry contingent on his left. At <b>seven</b> <b>o'clock,</b> Belgian scouts sighted the two-thousand strong Mahdist force assembled along a two-mile line that spanned {{a range of}} hills between the Nile and a parallel river. There was one clear path through the hills, which was especially well defended. Commandant Chaltin brought forward five companies for the attack, leaving his remaining three in reserve.|$|E
5|$|The Mahdists withdrew to the {{fortified}} town of Rejaf, while Chaltin's column {{marched in}} pursuit for seventeen miles until the occupied town was sighted at about one-thirty in the afternoon. A battery of artillery pieces fired on the Belgians {{as they came}} within range, but the effect was negligible. As the Belgians approached, a hidden force of Mahdists emerged from a ravine near {{the bank of the}} Nile and attacked Chaltin's flank. The commandant realized the threat in time and repulsed the attack without much loss. Chaltin's companies then turned to begin the attack on the town. For several hours Chaltin's companies pushed through the streets and houses of Rejaf, forcing the Mahdists back until by <b>seven</b> <b>o'clock</b> they had been nearly expelled entirely. Only the citadel remained occupied, but by dawn the next morning the remaining Mahdist forces retreated, leaving behind their weapons and munitions.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of 18 June, one of the {{greatest}} ever feats of British arms began: The Battle of Waterloo. The British, Dutch, Belgian, Nassau and German troops were posted on higher ground south of Waterloo. There had been heavy rain overnight and Napoleon chose not to attack until almost midday. The delay meant that the Prussians had a chance to march towards the battle, but in the meantime, Wellington had to hold on. The French started their attack with an artillery bombardment. The first French attacks were then directed against the Chateau of Hougemont down from the main ridge. Here British and Nassau troops stubbornly defended the Hougomont buildings all day; the action eventually engaging a whole French Corps which failed to capture the Chateau. At half past one, the Anglo-Allied Army was assaulted by d'Erlon's infantry attack on the British left wing but the French were forced back with heavy losses. Later in the afternoon, British troops were amazed to see waves of cavalrymen heading towards them. The British troops, as per standard drill, formed infantry squares (hollow box-formations four ranks deep) after which the French cavalry was driven off. As the Prussian advance guard began to arrive from the east, Napoleon sent French units to stabilise his right wing. At around <b>seven</b> <b>o'clock,</b> Napoleon ordered his Old and Middle Guard to make a final assault on the by now fragile Allied line. The attack was repulsed. At that point Wellington stood up and waved his hat in the air to signal a general advance. His army rushed forward from the lines in a full assault on the retreating French. Napoleon fled the scene.|$|E

500|$|At {{approximately}} <b>seven</b> <b>oâ€™clock</b> on {{the night}} of November 23, the news began to spread around the Lafayette campus as a caravan of students traversed the school grounds to recruit more protesters. Soon after, a mass of nearly 1,000 students holding flaming newspapers in hand made its way to the college's central quadrangle, which housed the materials for a bonfire. [...] This bonfire was previously constructed for a pep rally to be held before the football game against Lafayette's rival, Lehigh University, but was never used due to a rain storm. Therefore, the student mob ignited the fire to continue its demonstration.|$|E

The officiating {{chaplain}} Humphrey Tyndall later remarked that the bride wore a [...] "loose gown" [...] (an informal morning dress), which has triggered modern speculation {{that she was pregnant}} and that the ceremony happened under pressure from her father. The marriage was, however, in planning between Leicester and his wedding guests for almost a year. While Lettice Devereux may well have been pregnant, there is no further indication as to this.

500|$|On January 25, 1865 the Shenandoah made harbor at Williamstown, Victoria, near Melbourne, {{in order}} to repair damage {{received}} while capturing Union whaling-ships.

[...] The United States consul, William Blanchard, insisted that the Victorian government arrest the Confederates as pirates, but Victoria's governor, Sir Charles Henry Darling, ignored his pleas, satisfied with the Shenandoahâ€™s pleading of neutrality when requesting {{to be allowed to}} undertake repairs. [...] Aside from a few fist fights between Americans, there was no direct conflict between the two warring sides in Melbourne.

[...] Speaking about his youth appeal, he noted, [...] "They donâ€™t sit and watch TV and turn the programs on at <b>seven</b> <b>o'clock</b> to watch us like that â€“ so I thought the technology was there.

500|$|By {{the time}} Braidwood {{and his men}} had arrived on the scene, the House of Lords had been destroyed. A strong south-westerly breeze had fanned the flames along the wood-panelled and narrow {{corridors}} into St Stephen's Chapel. Shortly after his arrival {{the roof of the}} chapel collapsed; the resultant noise was so loud that the watching crowds thought there had been a Gunpowder Plot-style explosion. According to The Manchester Guardian, [...] "By half-past <b>seven</b> <b>o'clock</b> the engines were brought to play upon the building both from the river and the land side, but the flames had by this time acquired such a predominance that the quantity of water thrown upon them produced no visible effect." [...] Braidwood saw {{it was too late to}} save most of the palace, so elected to focus his efforts on saving Westminster Hall, and he had his firemen cut away the part of the roof that connected the hall to the already burning Speaker's House, and then soak the hall's roof to prevent it catching fire. In doing so he saved the medieval structure at the expense of those parts of the complex already ablaze.|$|E

60|$|Of {{course it}} would have been folly to look for the {{attorney}} in his office at such an hour, and the possibility of doing any business before <b>seven</b> or eight <b>o'clock</b> was so slight that Carrots, with the recklessness of a spendthrift, invited his friend to a breakfast at Mose Pearson's, even though it involved an expenditure of fully one-fifth of his entire wealth.|$|R
60|$|From {{the moment}} when the troops fell in on the 10th, till they reached Barkai on the 14th, there was a general action from front to rear.

Serious opposition, however, did not take place until five and a half miles of the valley had been passed.|$|R
500|$|Still in {{a shallow}} dive, I {{observed}} another P-38 and an Me 109 going round and round. It seemed that the 38 needed help so I started down.

By this time I was traveling in excess of [...] My left window blew out, scaring {{the hell out of}} me. I thought I had been hit by some of the ground fire I had observed in the vicinity. I regained control of the aircraft and pulled out above a wheat field. I tried to contact the flight to get myself recognized, but observed an Me 109 making a pass at me from about <b>seven</b> <b>o'clock</b> high. I broke left as well as my plane could and the Jerry overshot. I straightened out and gave him a burst. He chandelled steeply to the left and I shot some more. He passed right over me and I slipped over in an Immelmann. As I straightened out at the top, I saw the pilot bail out.|$|E
500|$|Without a map, {{the route}} they chose was largely conjectural. By dawn they had ascended to [...] {{and could see}} the {{northern}} coast. They were above Possession Bay, which meant {{they would need to}} move eastward to reach their intended destination of Stromness. This meant the first of several backtrackings that would extend the journey and frustrate the men. At the close of that first day, needing to descend to the valley below them before nightfall, they risked everything by sliding down a mountainside on a makeshift rope sledge. There was no question of restâ€”they travelled on by moonlight, moving upwards towards a gap in the next mountainous ridge. [...] Early next morning, 20 May, seeing Husvik Harbour below them, they knew that they were on the right path. At <b>seven</b> <b>o'clock</b> in the morning they heard the steam whistle sound from Stromness, [...] "the first sound created by an outside human agency that had come to our ears since we left Stromness Bay in December 1914". After a difficult descent, which involved passage down through a freezing waterfall, they at last reached safety.|$|E

2500|$|Soon, {{administrators of}} the agency which managed the habous as well as various other Tunisian notables arrived, and told the crowd that the {{municipality}} had decided to drop its application to register the land.

60|$|Usually it cooled {{off toward}} <b>seven</b> or eight <b>o'clock,</b> {{even though the}} sun still shone well up in the sky, but this night proved as warm as the day had been, {{and most of the}} party went to sleep outdoors, unable to stand it inside of the close tents.

Basil would have eked out the business of checking the trunks into an affair of some length, but the baggage-master did his duty with pitiless celerity; and so Basil, in the mere excess of his disoccupation, bought an accident-insurance ticket. This employed him half a minute, and then he gave up the unequal contest, and went and took his place beside Isabel, who sat prettily wrapped in her shawl, perfectly content.|$|R
