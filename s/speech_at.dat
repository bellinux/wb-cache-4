His influence at the Labour Club, more than anyone else's, I think, explains {{the failure of the}} Communists to make headway there. [...] There were so many naive people around who could have been taken in." [...] He increased the Labour Club's membership by three quarters by the time he left.|$|R

5|$|After the crisis, superpower {{relations}} improved, as Kennedy gave a conciliatory <b>speech</b> <b>at</b> American University on 10 June 1963, {{recognizing the}} Soviet people's suffering during World War II, and paying tribute to their achievements.
