25|$|The first ARM {{application}} {{was as a}} second processor for the BBC Micro, where it helped in developing simulation software to finish development of the <b>support</b> <b>chips</b> (VIDC, IOC, MEMC), and sped up the CAD software used in ARM2 development. Wilson subsequently rewrote BBC BASIC in ARM assembly language. The in-depth knowledge gained from designing the instruction set enabled the code to be very dense, making ARM BBC BASIC an extremely good test for any ARM emulator. The original aim of a principally ARM-based computer was achieved in 1987 {{with the release of}} the Acorn Archimedes. In 1992, Acorn once more won the Queen's Award for Technology for the ARM.|$|E
500|$|Microsoft imposed {{tight control}} on the {{development}} and production of Windows RT devices: they were designed {{in cooperation with the}} company, and built to strict design and hardware specifications, including requirements to only use [...] "approved" [...] models of certain components. To ensure hardware quality and control the number of devices released upon launch, the three participating ARM chip makers were only allowed to partner with up to two PC manufacturers to develop the first [...] "wave" [...] of Windows RT devices in Microsoft's development program. Qualcomm partnered with Samsung and HP, Nvidia with Asus and Lenovo, and Texas Instruments with Toshiba. Additionally, Microsoft partnered with Nvidia to produce Surface (retroactively renamed [...] "Surface RT") – the first Windows-based computing device to be manufactured and marketed directly by Microsoft. Windows RT was designed to <b>support</b> <b>chips</b> meeting the ARMv7 architecture, a 32-bit processor platform. Shortly after the original release of Windows RT, ARM Holdings disclosed that it was working with Microsoft and other software partners on supporting the new ARMv8-A architecture, which include a new 64-bit variant, in preparation for future devices.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s and early 1980s General Instrument, like nearly every {{microelectronics}} manufacturer, was rolling {{out their own}} series of microprocessors and <b>support</b> <b>chips</b> in hopes of gaining {{a share of the}} then-new and rapidly exploding market for increasingly sophisticated consumer and industrial electronics. One of the peripheral and <b>support</b> <b>chips</b> introduced for G.I.'s microprocessors was the SP0256 Narrator speech synthesizer chip. Since the Intellivision was already based on General Instrument's CP1610 microprocessor and <b>support</b> <b>chips,</b> and talking electronic products (such as Texas Instruments' Speak & Spell) had already captured the public's fascination, it didn't take long for someone at Mattel Electronics to get the idea that a speech-synthesis module might be an interesting add-on for the console. Engineer Ron Carlson was put in charge of designing a device capable of utilizing the chip. Programmer Ron Surratt was hired to write the software for the module, and Patrick Jost would analyze the voice data for the device.|$|E
5000|$|A {{key factor}} {{in the success of}} the 8080 was the broad range of <b>support</b> <b>chips</b> available, {{providing}} serial communications, counter/timing, input/output, direct memory access, and programmable interrupt control amongst other functions: ...|$|E
40|$|The EU FP 7 funded project Chip 2 Foil aims {{to realise}} a {{technology}} platform allowing {{a radically different}} implementation of the assembly process for ultra-thin chips (UTCs) to polymer foils. The process is based on redistribution of the tolerance budget, and consists of two major steps: self-assembly <b>supported</b> <b>chip</b> placement followed by an adaptive circuitry approach for realising the electrical interconnects. The concept accepts non-contact, low precision presentation of a UTC to the self-assembly force field, which brings the chip to a final position with moderate precision. Next, in an adaptive interconnection process the chip position is measured {{with respect to the}} circuitry on the foil and interconnects are created on an individual chip and IO basis. The main technology building blocks are described and the current performance is demonstrated, including chip thinning, fast UTC release from wafer tape, self-assembly <b>supported</b> <b>chip</b> placement using magnetic forces and adaptive electrical interconnection by laser scribing of a screen-printed silver patch...|$|R

50|$|The VDC is {{the main}} {{component}} of the video signal generator logic, responsible for generating the timing of video signals such as the horizontal and vertical synchronization signals and the blanking interval signal. Sometimes other <b>supporting</b> <b>chips</b> were necessary to build a complete system, such as RAM to hold pixel data, ROM to hold character fonts, or some discrete logic such as shift registers.|$|R
50|$|The {{complete}} system included <b>support</b> <b>chips</b> co-designed {{with the}} CPU, {{such as a}} dynamic memory controller, keyboard controller with timers, printer controller and CRT controller. A special buffer chip connected to the expansion slots.|$|E
5000|$|Inmos also {{produced}} {{a variety of}} <b>support</b> <b>chips</b> for the transputer processors, such as the C004 32-way link switch and the C012 [...] "link adapter" [...] which allowed transputer links to be interfaced to an 8-bit data bus.|$|E
50|$|Acorn's silicon partner, VLSI, {{had been}} tasked with finding new {{applications}} for the ARM CPU and <b>support</b> <b>chips.</b> Hauser's Active Book company had been developing a handheld device and for this the ARM CPU developers had created a static version of their processor, the ARM2aS.|$|E
50|$|An {{improvement}} on the PAL was the generic array logic device, or GAL, invented by Lattice Semiconductor in 1985. This device {{has the same}} logical properties as the PAL but can be erased and reprogrammed. The GAL is very useful in the prototyping stage of a design, when any bugs in the logic can be corrected by reprogramming. GALs are programmed and reprogrammed using a PAL programmer, or by using the in-circuit programming technique on <b>supporting</b> <b>chips.</b>|$|R
50|$|In general, the {{enhancements}} {{are aimed}} at improving quality of service for video streaming and high-priority interrupts. In addition, the standard continues to support distances up to one meter. The newer speeds may require higher power consumption for <b>supporting</b> <b>chips,</b> though improved process technologies and power management techniques may mitigate this. The later specification can use existing SATA cables and connectors, though it was reported in 2008 that some OEMs were expected to upgrade host connectors for the higher speeds.|$|R
5000|$|The Original Amiga Chipset {{included}} a <b>support</b> <b>chip</b> {{known as the}} [...] "Copper" [...] that handled interrupts and other timing and housekeeping duties independently of the CPU and the video system. Using the Copper, {{it was possible to}} call back into the CPU to run short tasks while the video display was handling the vertical or horizontal blank interrupt (HBI). This allowed programmers to tie machine code to the display without causing visual artifacts, which makes many video effects much simpler to implement.|$|R
50|$|The 8080 {{requires}} two <b>support</b> <b>chips</b> {{to function}} in most applications, the i8224 clock generator/driver and the i8228 bus controller, and it is implemented in NMOS using non-saturated enhancement-mode transistors as loads, therefore demanding a +12 V and a −5 V voltage {{in addition to the}} main TTL-compatible +5 V.|$|E
50|$|Processors of {{this era}} {{required}} {{a number of}} <b>support</b> <b>chips</b> to be included outside of the processor. RAM and EPROM were separate, often requiring memory management or refresh circuitry for dynamic memory. I/O processing might {{have been carried out}} by a single chip such as the 8255, but frequently required several more chips.|$|E
50|$|The CVAX is a {{microprocessor}} chip set developed and fabricated by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) that implemented the VAX instruction set architecture (ISA). The chip set {{consisted of the}} CVAX 78034 CPU, CFPA floating-point accelerator, CVAX clock chip, and the associated <b>support</b> <b>chips,</b> the CVAX System Support Chip (CSSC), CVAX Memory Controller (CMCTL), and CVAX Q-Bus Interface Chip (CQBIC).|$|E

50|$|Even {{though it}} is {{generally}} accepted that chipping is a bad practice, some climbing areas allow it. Some climbers {{in areas such as}} Riggins, Idaho have accepted the use of chipping for the creation of new routes. Those who <b>support</b> <b>chipping</b> in these select few climbing areas accept this practice because the area's rock face is blank and climbs would be physically impossible without manufactured holds. The general consensus in these areas seems to be that the common belief against chipping is less important than having areas to climb.|$|R
5000|$|For this role, the Atari 2600 used an {{all-in-one}} <b>support</b> <b>chip</b> {{known as}} the TIA to provide graphics and sound support to its stripped down MOS Technology 6502-derivative, the 6507. Due to {{the high price of}} computer memory, the TIA was designed to use almost no traditional RAM, which led to both a quirky design as well as surprising programming flexibility. It was some time before programmers learned the knack of [...] "racing the beam", but when they did, 2600 games began to rapidly improve compared to early efforts.|$|R
