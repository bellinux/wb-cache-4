40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} designing {{a model of the}} effective <b>sociotherapy</b> in the system of rehabilitation of the prisoners. So far the classes of the <b>sociotherapy</b> were recognized and they are still treated as a field of a separate, specialized psychological help for young addicts or young people coming from families neglecting their educational functions. This is reflected in the history of <b>sociotherapy</b> in Poland. In the model proposed in the article, <b>sociotherapy</b> {{is an integral part of}} the system of psychological support. This system is important part of support for the activities, impacts and interventions of a purely rehabilitative nature. In the presented text author has outlined the shape of this system, with a particular focus on <b>sociotherapy</b> – consistent with an axiology of the rehabilitative pedagogy. He has adopted a cardinal thesis that the role of psychological help in the prison rehabilitation should be a gradual, processual and phased outputting of the convicted from the specific social excluding isolation, connected with the prohibited acts committed by him, to actively functioning in the different societal circles. The essential content of the psychological influence is a relatively controlled, escalating build-up and implementation of the socializing incentives. In the next part of this article the author pointed out, according to research of the research team led by the author as part of research and development project, the importance of an individual diagnosis, qualifying for the <b>sociotherapy.</b> Then he focused on the principles of the diagnosis of the individual in the socio-therapeutic group and of the diagnosis of the group as a resultant of the diagnosis of single units that create it. The main part of the article, on the basis of the integrated <b>sociotherapy,</b> shows the cardinal principles that should be used by the sociotherapeutic teams that are organized and operated in the prison, both organized from among prisoners and for Prison Service officers. The described principles can be also applied to the sociotherapies organized and operated in the open environments with socially unfit adults, whose primary concern is a criminal behavior. The summary indicated what are the central and boundary conditions for <b>sociotherapy</b> to gained rehabilitative function and that it could be its leading function. Author has also drawn an attention to the need of research and dialogue between researchers – theorists and therapists working in practice, centralized around the problem of constructing the statements of the <b>sociotherapy</b> praxeology with the prisoners and persons because of their criminal activities. 3919322012 Studia Edukacyjn...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In post-genocide Rwanda, many {{different}} kind of interventions have been implemented on different levels of society focusing on the healing of psychological problems and reconciliation between victims and perpetrators of the previous political violence. This article presents the practice of community-based <b>sociotherapy</b> and its impact in terms of healing and reconciliation {{as well as its}} specificity compared to other interventions. Methodology: A variety of qualitative research methods were used with an emphasis on the most significant-change-stories method. Results: <b>Sociotherapy</b> was introduced in Rwanda in 2005. <b>Sociotherapy</b> groups of 10 - 12 people living in the same neighborhood meet once a week during 2 - 3 hours for a period of 15 weeks. The most significant problems people suffer from due to the political violence is the destruction of social relations. It is in the phase of care that is usually reached during the 4 th of 5 th session that a change in people’s behavior and interaction with others, including former enemies, takes place. This change results in a rerouting of their personal, family and community life which is experienced as a release of problems previously buried in people’s hearts. While many of the interventions in Rwanda which are specifically aimed at reconciliation result at most, in ‘thin’ reconciliation, <b>sociotherapy</b> resulted, in many cases, in ‘thick’ reconciliation. Conclusion: Justice and care should complement each other when the aim is healing from the wounds of a violent past and reconciliation along ethnic lines...|$|E

In sociotherapeutic practices children and adolescents are engaged in joint activities, which are, to a large extent, artificial, and built on symbolic values. Therefore, it is important to be guided not only by goals, means, and regulations, but also by evidence-based helpfulness. As a result of phenomenological analysis of reflexive texts written by adolescents at the end of a six-month sociotherapeutic program the main themes and meanings of the experience of identification and authentification were singled out...|$|E

There are different approaches to <b>sociotherapy,</b> from the original one of Rudolf Steiner (1924), to those of Marshal Edelson (1970) and John Stuart Whiteley (1986), {{but it is the}} more recent one of Leonardo Benvenuti (2002) to fully integrate the concepts of “culture,” “discourse” and “representation. ” This author, underlining the limited range of psychoanalysis, focuses his idea of therapy both on “culture,” interpreted as identification of the peculiar form of psychological organization of the patient as precondition to any intervention, and on “discourse” as method of interaction based on a dialogue supported by the phenomenological tool of “empathy. ” The whole dialogue between the therapist and the patient is aimed to reach a complete knowledge of the system of “representations” of the latter. Benvenuti defines a “representation” as the combination of a cognitive element, the “image,” and an affective element, the “affective investment. ” He looks for the roots of hardship or addiction in one or more “representations” of the patient, and this is the reason why they always must be unveiled and investigated.

40|$|To date, reviews show {{inconclusive}} {{results on}} the association between social capital and mental health. Evidence that social capital can intentionally be promoted is also scarce. Promotion of social capital may impact post-conflict recovery through both increased social cohesion and better mental health. However, studies on community interventions and social capital have mostly relied on cross-sectional study designs. We present a longitudinal study in Rwanda on the effect on social capital and mental health of <b>sociotherapy,</b> a community-based psychosocial group intervention consisting of fifteen weekly group sessions. We hypothesized that the intervention would impact social capital and, {{as a result of}} that, mental health. We used a quasi-experimental study design with measurement points pre- and post-intervention and at eight months follow-up (2007 - 2008). Considering sex and living situation, we selected 100 adults for our experimental group. We formed a control group of 100 respondents with similar symptom score distribution, age, and sex from a random community sample in the same region. Mental health was assessed by use of the Self Reporting Questionnaire, and social capital through a locally adapted version of the short Adapted Social Capital Assessment Tool. It measures three elements of social capital: cognitive social capital, support, and civic participation. Latent growth models were used to examine whether effects of <b>sociotherapy</b> on mental health and social capital were related. Civic participation increased with 7 % in the intervention group versus 2 % in controls; mental health improved with 10 % versus 5 % (both: p < 0. 001). Linear changes over time were not significantly correlated. Support and cognitive social capital did not show consistent changes. These findings hint at the possibility to foster social capital and simultaneously impact mental health. Further identification of pathways of influence may contribute to the designing of psychosocial interventions that effectively promote recovery in war-affected populations.

The effectiveness of psychiatric day hospital care for this condition remains disputed. We report here the assessment of a psychotherapeutic day hospital program {{in a series of}} elderly people with dementia and concomitant BPSD. METHODS: Treatment setting: The day hospital program combined music, movement, psychodynamic group therapies, <b>sociotherapy</b> as well as individual interviews and family interventions. Participants: 76 individuals with mild to moderate dementia. Outcome measures: The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), Therapeutic Community Assessment scale including staff (SAS) and client assessments (CAS) and a Group Evaluation Scale (GES) were administrated at admission, 3, 6 and 12 months and discharge. RESULTS: Linear regression analysis showed that SAS (but not CAS) and GES scores significantly increased while the NPI total scores decreased across the different time points. NPI item score modifications were significant for anxiety and apathy. These changes remained significant when demographic variables, drug treatment changes and occurrence of life events were also considered.

40|$|Background: The “treatment gap” (TG) {{for mental}} {{disorders}} {{refers to the}} difference that exists {{between the number of}} people who need care and those who receive care. The concept is strongly promoted by the World Health Organization and widely used in the context of low- and middle-income countries. Although accepting the many demonstrable benefits that flow from this approach, it is important to critically reflect on the limitations of the concept of the TG and its implications for building capacity for mental health services in Rwanda. Objective: The article highlights concerns that the evidence base for mental health interventions is not globally valid, and problematizes the preponderance of psychiatric approaches in international guidelines for mental health. Specifically, the risk of medicalization of social problems and the limited way in which “community” has been conceptualized in global mental health discourses are addressed. Rather than being used as a method for increasing economic efficiency (i. e., reducing healthcare costs), “community” should be promoted as a means of harnessing collective strengths and resources to help promote mental well-being. This may be particularly beneficial for contexts, like Rwanda, where community life has been disrupted by collective violence, and the resulting social isolation constitutes an important determinant of mental distress. Conclusions: Moving forward there is a need to consider alternative paradigms where individual distress is understood as a symptom of social distress, which extends beyond the more individually oriented TG paradigm. <b>Sociotherapy,</b> an intervention used in Rwanda over the past 10 years, is presented as an example of how communities of support can be built to promote mental health and psychosocial well-being...|$|E
