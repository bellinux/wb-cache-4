50|$|Dedicated console <b>server</b> <b>appliances</b> are {{available}} {{from a number of}} manufacturers in many configurations, with the number of serial ports ranging from one to 96. These Console Servers are primarily used for secure remote access to Unix Servers, Linux Servers, switches, routers, firewalls, and any other device on the network with a console port. The purpose is to allow network operations center (NOC) personnel to perform secure remote data center management and out-of-band management of IT assets from anywhere in the world. Products marketed as Console Servers usually have highly advanced security functionality to ensure that only qualified personnel can access various servers and that any data that is transmitted across the LAN, or over the Internet, is encrypted. Marketing a product as a console server is very application specific because it really refers to what the user wants to do—remotely control, monitor, diagnose and troubleshoot equipment over a network or the Internet.|$|E
50|$|Cobalt Networks was a {{maker of}} {{low-cost}} Linux-based servers. Founded in 1996 in Mountain View, California under the name Cobalt Microserver, the company pioneered easy-to-use <b>server</b> <b>appliances</b> featuring secure web user interfaces, designed for Internet service providers (ISPs) and small to medium-sized businesses. Cobalt had an extremely successful IPO in December 1999 under the ticker symbol COBT, when its stock price surged from an initial value of $22 to $128.13 at market close. Less than a year later, in September 2000, Sun Microsystems announced it would acquire Cobalt for $2 billion in stock, {{in an attempt to}} compete with other Linux-based server vendors. Sun completed the acquisition in December 2000. In hindsight, the timing could not have been worse for an Internet-related acquisition, as the Internet bubble started to collapse {{in the last quarter of}} 2000, accelerating through the following year. Sun's Cobalt product line saw some initial success that soon dwindled as Cobalt's core ISP market started shrinking dramatically. In December 2003, Sun retired its Cobalt products, opting at the same time to open source the underlying software and firmware.|$|E

40|$|While console {{support is}} one of the most mundane {{portions}} of an operating system, console access is critical, especially during system debugging and for some low-level system-administration operations. As a result, densely packed servers and <b>server</b> <b>appliances</b> have either keyboard/video/mouse (KVM) cabling and KVM switches or serial ports, cabling, and concentrators. Further increases in the density of <b>server</b> <b>appliances</b> and blades require eliminating these items. We did so in the design of a prototype dense-server-blade system that includes none of the standard external ports for console devices. Since the standard means for console accesss, KVM or serial, were not possible, we developed lowlevel software to redirect console activity to the Ethernet interface. This paper describes the console support over the network interface that we developed for both our LinuxBIOS-based boot-time firmware and the Linux operating system. We refer to this code as console over Ethernet or etherconsole. We found it invaluable in debugging and evaluating our prototype server blades. We also describe ways of extending our work to make it more transparent to existing firmware and operating systems...|$|E

40|$|Enterprise-class <b>server</b> <b>appliances</b> such as networkattached storage {{systems or}} network routers can benefit greatly from {{virtualization}} technologies. However, current inter-VM communication techniques have significant performance overheads when employed between highly-collaborative appliance components, thereby limiting {{the use of}} virtualization in such systems. We present Fido, an inter-VM communication mechanism that leverages the inherent relaxed trust model between the software components in an appliance to achieve high performance. We have also developed common device abstractions- a network device (MMNet) and a block device (MMBlk) on top of Fido. We evaluate MMNet and MMBlk using microbenchmarks and find that they outperform existing alternative mechanisms. As a case study, we have implemented a virtualized architecture for a network-attached storage system incorporating Fido, MMNet, and MMBlk. We use both microbenchmarks and TPC-C to evaluate our virtualized storage system architecture. In comparison to a monolithic architecture, the virtualized one exhibits nearly no performance penalty in our benchmarks, thus demonstrating the viability of virtualized enterprise server architectures that use Fido. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a recovery protocol for block I/O operations in Slice, a storage system architecture for highspeed LANs incorporating network-attached block storage. The {{goal of the}} Slice architecture {{is to provide a}} network file service with scalable bandwidth and capacity while preserving compatibility with off-the-shelf clients and file <b>server</b> <b>appliances.</b> The Slice prototype “virtualizes ” the Network File System (NFS) protocol by interposing a request switching filter at the client’s interface to the network storage system (e. g., in a network adapter or switch). The distributed Slice architecture separates functions typically combined in central file servers, introducing new challenges for failure atomicity. This paper {{presents a}} protocol for atomic file operations and recovery in the Slice architecture, and related support for reliable file storage using mirrored striping. Experimental results from the Slice prototype show that the protocol has low cost in the common case, allowing the system to deliver client file access bandwidths approaching gigabit-per-second network speeds. ...|$|E
