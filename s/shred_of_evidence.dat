His first film role was a bit part in the 1962 adaptation of The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner starring Tom Courtenay and he also acted on-stage opposite Sir Laurence Olivier in Semi-Detached (1962) by David Turner. He appeared in several episodes of the BBC police series Z-Cars in 1963–64 as a detective constable. Between 1964 and 1966, he starred in two series of the ABC Weekend Television/ITV production Redcap, playing the hard-nosed military policeman Sergeant John Mann. He was also a guest star in an early episode of The Avengers. In 1967 he appeared in the Granada TV/ITV series, Inheritance, alongside James Bolam and Michael Goodliffe, as well as appearing in TV plays such as The Talking Head and episodes of series such as Budgie, where he played against type (opposite Adam Faith) as an effeminate failed playwright with a full beard and a Welsh accent.|$|E

Brown recalls that Mardas told him that a young blonde nurse from California had said she'd had a sexual relationship with the Maharishi. In addition, Mardas arranged to spy on the Maharishi when Bonas was with him, and said that he saw the two of them in a compromising position. At the same time, {{many of the people who}} were there, including Harrison, Horn, Cooke de Herrera, Cynthia Lennon and Jennie Boyd did not believe that the Maharishi had made a pass at any woman. According to Cynthia Lennon, Mardas' allegations about the Maharishi's indiscretions with a lady gained momentum [...] "without a single <b>shred</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> or justification."

In order to understand these effects, we conducted a qualitative evaluation of the Organic tool.

Further they assert that the splint bones of the horse are a remnant of the toes that once existed during prehistoric eras. Additionally, claims are made that the size variation in the fossil record shows that there were once prehistoric horses that were much smaller than domestic horses are today. However, upon examination, these “proofs ” of evolution are found insufficient.

30|$|Evolution of the {{mechanism}} of memory stems from {{the mechanism}} of navigation [8]. This extends support to the hypothesis of a phylogenetic continuity and a direct relationship between the navigation and memory processes. Within this model, the hippocampus is considered as a central hub for the shared neural mechanisms that are recruited during navigation and declarative memories (episodic and semantic memory). The dichotomy of declarative memories is distinguishable like the two forms of the spatial frame of reference. Expanding on this idea, allocentric representation and semantic memory {{on one hand and}} egocentric representation and episodic memory on the other, support a common network for memory and navigation. Along the same lines, the integration of multiple routes into a cognitive map might be related to the integration of episodic memory contents with a semantic network [9]. In addition, the series of events encoded as spatial memory can be represented with the full support of episodic memory. All these <b>shreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> reflect the interwoven networks of navigation and memory [10]. This is the focal point of our study, as we have compared good and bad navigators with respect to their retrieval of spatial knowledge (memory and navigation).|$|R

30|$|Advertising {{is an old}} phenomenon, {{which has}} been evolved over centuries. Multidimensional tactics, which are being {{incorporated}} in advertisements to influence consumer behavior, have ushered the advertisement industry into a new era. Since emotions shape consumers’ behavior and decision-making (Khuong and Tram, 2015; Sebastian, 2014), anecdotal <b>shreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> suggest that emotional advertisement (EA) has become a strategic tool to influence consumer behavior favorably in a diversified business world. Advertisers deploy creative strategies, for example, incorporating emotions into advertisements in order to play on consumers’ heartstrings {{with the intention of}} influencing their decision-making (Roozen, 2013). The oft-quoted emotional descriptions link emotions (E) to gestures, postures, and tactics to manage actions or reactions (Bagozzi et al., 1999; Hakkak et al., 2016; King, 2016 Rhoton, 2014). Emotions are generally perceived to be categorized in the obvious conceptualized dimensions, for example, negative emotions (shame, disgust, fear, sadness, anger, rage, revenge, disappointment, etc.) and positive emotions (joy, love, pride, happiness, hope, etc.) (Hakkak et al., 2016; Plutchik, 1997; Ekman, 2007; Bindu et al., 2007), but there is more emotional context hidden beneath this simple demarcation. Many researchers see the need to study specific emotional states in greater detail. This is the reason that in the marketing context emotional appeals and their incorporation into promotions were rated as firms’ most important tools for successful marketing strategies (Roos, 2014).|$|R

The population of this study was 75 students from the fourth semester of English Education Study Program of IKIP PGRI Bojonegoro, East Java, Indonesia. The sample was selected through cluster random sampling and consisted of 50 students that were divided into two groups. The instrument used to collect the data was a writing test. Consequently, normality and homogeneity of the data were tested. A t-test was used to compare the mean of the two groups. The hypothesis was designed and tested at 0. 05 level of significance. The results revealed that there is a significant difference in students’ academic writing skill between the students who were taught by using the ELT research papers as authentic materials and those who were taught by using textbook materials. The t-test revealed that t-value is higher than t-table (6. 07 > 2. 01).

40|$|A conference paper co {{authored}} by Val Williams and Sara Davidmann and {{presented at the}} conference: Researching, Writing and Exhibiting Photography Symposium organized by the Institute for Modern and Contemporary Culture at the University of Westminster. In 2013, curator Val Williams read a press story about the archive which artists Sara Davidmann had inherited (with her two siblings) from her mother, Audrey. The archive contained papers, letters and photographs which related to {{a period of years}} in the 1950 s and 60 s, when Audrey’s younger sister Hazel discovered that her husband Ken, was transgender. Frim this archive Sara had begun to make work and the early makings of the series ‘The Dress’ and ‘For Ken’ had begun to evolve. Sara was also doing very detailed research into the archive itself, transcribing letters, tracing references, attempting to decipher the relationship between family members, from <b>shreds</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence,</b> mainly letters. The relationship between Val Williams as editor and curator, Sara Davidmann as family archivist and artist began revolves around three curatorial outcomes: 1. a small exhibition Ken. To be destroyed at the UAL Photography and the Archive Research Centre in 2013, 2. An exhibition at the Schwules Museum in Berlin which was an enlarged version of the 2013 show, with new work by Sara and the latest iteration Ken. To be Destroyed in the Upper Gallery at the London College of Communication, staged as the central show of the Moose on the Loose Biennale, 2017. This paper will look at the ways in which three very different outcomes, in different locations and with different audiences in two different countries have come from the ‘Ken’ project and archive resources {{and the way in which}} the curatorial/artist collaboration has worked over the three projects. Particular research questions of interest could be: 1. 	How does curatorship and collaboration ensure that a project such as Ken. To be destroyed will appeal to the broadest possible audience? 2. 	How is the balance between the archive’s narrative and art practice emerging from the archive, created and maintained? 3. 	To what extent does audience matter when making a new exhibition- e. g. Schwules, which has a loyal core audience interested in ‘queer’ issues (as well as a wider public) and LCC where the audience is predominantly students and staff. 4. 	How do the characteristics of exhibition space determine what is produced and selected and how it is shown?
