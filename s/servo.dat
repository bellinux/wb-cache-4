5|$|Some active subwoofers use a <b>servo</b> {{feedback}} mechanism {{based on}} cone movement which modifies the signal {{sent to the}} voice coil. The <b>servo</b> feedback signal is derived from {{a comparison of the}} input signal to the amplifier versus the actual motion of the cone. The usual source of the feedback signal is a few turns of voice coil attached to the cone or a microchip-based accelerometer placed on the cone itself. An advantage of a well-implemented <b>servo</b> subwoofer design is reduced distortion making smaller enclosure sizes possible. The primary disadvantages are cost and complexity.|$|E
5|$|<b>Servo</b> {{controlled}} subwoofers are not {{the same}} as Servodrive subwoofers whose primary mechanism of sound reproduction avoids the normal voice coil and magnet combination in favor of a high-speed belt-driven servomotor. The Servodrive design increases output power, reduces harmonic distortion and virtually eliminates the loss of loudspeaker output that results from an increase in voice coil impedance due to overheating of the voice coil (called power compression.) This feature allows high power operation for extended periods of time. Intersonics was nominated for a TEC Award for its <b>Servo</b> Drive Loudspeaker (SDL) design in 1986 and for the Bass Tech 7 model in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Another early {{subwoofer}} enclosure {{made for}} home and studio use was the separate bass speaker for the <b>Servo</b> Statik 1 by New Technology Enterprises. Designed as a prototype in 1966 by physicist Arnold Nudell and airline pilot Cary Christie in Nudell's garage, it used a second winding around a custom Cerwin Vega 18-inch (45cm) driver to provide <b>servo</b> control {{information to the}} amplifier, and it was offered for sale at $1795, some 40% more expensive than any other complete loudspeaker listed at Stereo Review. In 1968, the two found outside investors and reorganized as Infinity. The subwoofer was reviewed positively in Stereophile magazine's winter 1968 issue as the SS-1 by Infinity. The SS-1 received very good reviews in 1970 from High Fidelity magazine.|$|E

According to Glarean's story, it worked: the court applauded, and the king gave Josquin his benefice.

5|$|Most {{variants}} of the CFM56 feature a single-annular combustor. An annular combustor is a continuous ring where fuel is {{injected into the}} airflow and ignited, raising the pressure and temperature of the flow.

Fuel injection is regulated by a Hydromechanical Unit (HMU), built by Honeywell. The HMU regulates the amount of fuel delivered to the engine {{by means of an}} electrohydraulic <b>servo</b> valve that, in turn, drives a fuel metering valve, that provides information to the full authority digital engine controller (FADEC).|$|E
5|$|Robinson {{made his}} {{professional}} debut on October 4, 1940, winning via second-round stoppage over Joe Echevarria.

In 1941, he defeated world champion Sammy Angott, future champion Marty <b>Servo</b> and former champion Fritzie Zivic. The Robinson-Angott fight was held above the lightweight limit, since Angott {{did not want to}} risk losing his lightweight title. Robinson defeated Zivic in front of 20,551 at Madison Square Garden—one of the largest crowds in the arena to that date. Robinson won the first five rounds according to The New York Times Joseph C. Nichols, before Zivic came back to land several punches to Robinson's head in the sixth and seventh rounds. Robinson controlled the next two rounds, and had Zivic in the ninth. After a close tenth round, Robinson was announced as the winner on all three scorecards.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A new {{approach}} to improve regulation and path planning visual <b>servoing</b> is proposed in this paper, where fuzzy filters are applied to smooth the control action. In visual <b>servoing</b> the speed of convergence depends on a constant gain, that directly influences the velocity of the robot manipulator joints. This velocity can achieve undesired behavior in regulation visual <b>servoing</b> due to its intrinsically discrete behavior and because a proportional control is normally used. In visual <b>servoing</b> by path planning {{the goal is to}} diminish the control actions during the <b>servoing.</b> In this paper the image features error is filtered by means of fuzzy filters, to improve the behavior of the robot joint velocities, without degrading the performance of the <b>servoing.</b> Experimental results are presented for a 2 degrees-offreedom (DOF) robot manipulator, which is performing visual <b>servoing,</b> moving to a pre-defined image features position. Simulation results are also presented when the 2 DOF robot manipulator is following a planned trajectory in the image space...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a new {{approach}} to visionbased robot control, called 2 - 1 / 2 -D visual <b>servoing,</b> which avoids the respective drawbacks of classical position-based and imagebased visual <b>servoing.</b> Contrary to the position-based visual <b>servoing,</b> our scheme does not need any geometric three-dimensional (3 -D) model of the object. Furthermore and contrary to imagebased visual <b>servoing,</b> our approach ensures the convergence of the control law in the whole task space. 2 - 1 / 2 -D visual <b>servoing</b> is based on the estimation of the partial camera displacement from the current to the desired camera poses at each iteration of the control law. Visual features and data extracted from the partial displacement allow us to design a decoupled control law controlling the six camera d. o. f. The robustness of our visual <b>servoing</b> scheme with respect to camera calibration errors is also analyzed: the necessary and sufficient conditions for local asymptotic stability are easily obtained. Then, due to the simple structure of the system, sufficient conditions for global asymptotic stability are established. Finally, experimental results with an eye-in-hand robotic system confirm the improvement in the stability and convergence domain of the 2 - 1 / 2 -D visual <b>servoing</b> with respect to classical position-based and image-based visual <b>servoing...</b>|$|R
