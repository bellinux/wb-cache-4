40|$|The {{replacement}} of phenol with <b>sodium</b> <b>lignosulfonate</b> and formaldehyde with glutaraldehyde {{in the preparation}} of resins resulted in a new resol-type phenolic resin, sodium lignosulfonate-glutaraldehyde resin, in addition to sodium lignosulfonate-formaldehyde and phenol-formaldehyde resins. These resins were then used to prepare thermosets and composites reinforced with sisal fibers. Different techniques were used to characterize raw materials and/or thermosets and composites, including inverse gas chromatography, thermogravimetric analysis, and mechanical impact and flexural tests. The substitution of phenol by <b>sodium</b> <b>lignosulfonate</b> in the formulation of the composite matrices increased the impact strength of the respective composites from approximately 400 Jm(- 1) to 800 J m(- 1) and 1000 J m(- 1), showing a considerable enhancement from the {{replacement of}} phenol with <b>sodium</b> <b>lignosulfonate.</b> The wettability of the sisal fibers increased when the resins were prepared from <b>sodium</b> <b>lignosulfonate,</b> generating composites in which the adhesion at the fiber-matrix interface was stronger and favored the transference of load from the matrix to the fiber during impact. Results suggested that the composites experienced a different mechanism of load transfer from the matrix to the fiber when a bending load was applied, compared to that experienced during impact. The thermogravimetric analysis results demonstrated that the thermal stability of the composites was not affected by the use of <b>sodium</b> <b>lignosulfonate</b> as a phenolic-type reagent during the preparation of the matrices.

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of different parameters on the enzymatic polymerization of <b>sodium</b> <b>lignosulfonates</b> (SLS) by laccase, compared with the chemical treatment by manganese III. Different initial molecular weights of SLS (commercial SLS (17 800 Da), F- 1 (4300 Da), F- 2 (2500 Da), and F- 3 (2300 Da)) were tested. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC-UV), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and phenolic group determination showed that SLS molecular weight increases depending on the laccase origin, the enzyme, and the substrate concentrations and the initial molecular weight of the SLS fractions. The highest molecular weight (M-w) was obtained by fungal laccases, specifically when using laccase from Trametes versicolor, while no reactivity was observed by plant laccase (laccase from Rhus vernicifera). The largest increase of M-w (108 600 Da) is reached when using SLS (17 800 Da) at 50 g/L and 30 U/mL of laccase from Trametes versicolor. The laccase polymerization of SLS can be improved by the use of a mediator. In this study, 5 mediators were studied for F- 1 polymerization by laccase from Trametes versicolor: acetosyringone (ASG), violuric acid (VLA), 1 -hydroxy-benzotriazole (HBT), acetovanillone (ACV) and 2, 2 '-azino-bis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) (ABTS).

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of manganese lignosulfonates by a two-step method has been reported.

The obtained product was electroactive, and could be applied as the precursor of electroactive manganese oxide. The product showed a reversible redox activity in the potential range of 0 to 1 V vs. an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The electroactivity of the obtained product can be tentatively assigned to the redox activity of both the electrodeposited MnOx and the presence of lignosulfonate-derived quinones since the energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) confirmed the presence of organic matter in the deposit. It also showed substantial electrocatalytic activity towards the anodic oxidation of hydrogen peroxide.

30|$|With the {{assistance}} of <b>sodium</b> <b>lignosulfonate,</b> hierarchical nanoflake-array-flower nanostructure of ZnO has been fabricated by a facile precipitation method in mixed solvents. The <b>sodium</b> <b>lignosulfonate</b> amount used in our synthetic route is able to fine-tune ZnO morphology and an abundance of pores have been observed in the nanoflake-array-flower ZnO, which result in specific surface area reaching as high as 82.9  m 2 [*]·[*]g− 1. The synthesized ZnO exhibits superior photocatalytic activity even under low-power UV illumination (6  W). It is conjectured that both nanoflake-array structure and plenty of pores embedded in ZnO flakes may provide scaffold microenvironments to enhance photocatalytic activity. Additionally, this catalyst can be used repeatedly without a significant loss in photocatalytic activity. The low-cost, simple synthetic approach as well as high photocatalytic and recycling efficiency of our ZnO nanomaterials allows for application to treat wastewater containing organic pollutants in an effective way.|$|E
50|$|It is {{essential}} that large particles (> 150 μm for calcium carbonate and > 45 μm for quartz) should be eliminated from the rawmix, to facilitate chemical combination in the kiln. In the case of slurries, larger particles can be removed by hydrocyclones or sieving devices. These require {{a certain amount of}} energy, supplied by high pressure pumping. This process, and the moving and blending of the slurry, require careful control of the slurry viscosity. Clearly, a thinner slurry is easily obtained by adding more water, but at the expense of high energy consumption for its subsequent removal. In practice, the slurry is therefore made as thick as the plant equipment can handle. Cement rawmix slurries are Bingham plastics which can also exhibit thixotropic or rheopectic behaviour. The energy needed to pump slurry at a desired rate is controlled mainly by the slurry's yield stress, and this in turn varies more or less exponentially with the slurry solids/liquid ratio. In practice, deflocculants are often added in order to maintain pumpability at low moisture contents. Common deflocculants used (at typical dose rates of 0.005-0.03%) are sodium carbonate, sodium silicate, <b>sodium</b> polyphosphates and <b>lignosulfonates.</b> Under favourable circumstances, pumpable slurries with less than 25% water can be obtained.|$|R

We studied <b>sodium</b> and rubidium <b>lignosulfonate</b> in water amp; 8722;methanol mixtures and in dimethyl formamide. The number average molecular weights of the Na and Rb lignosulfonate fractions were 7600 g mol and 9100 g mol, respectively, and the polydispersity index for both was 2. Anomalous small angle X ray scattering ASAXS was used for determining the distribution of counterions around the Rb lignosulfonate macromolecules. The scattering curves were fitted with a model constructed from ellipsoids of revolution of different sizes. Counterions were taken into account by deriving an approximative formula for the scattering intensity of the Poisson amp; 8722;Boltzmann diffuse double layer model. The interaction term between the spheroidal particles was estimated using the local monodisperse approximation and the improved Hayter amp; 8722;Penfold structure factor given by the rescaled mean spherical approximation. Effective charge of the polyelectrolyte and the local dielectric constant of the solvent close to the globular polyelectrolyte were followed {{as a function of the}} methanol content in the solvent and lignosulfonate concentration.

40|$|The {{concern about}} the {{environment}} has required {{that the effects of}} drilling fluids (muds) on surrounding areas be known. This study was initiated to investigate the effects of various muds on plant growth and on soils. In preliminary studies in Phase I (31 individual mud components), it was concluded that the obvious dominant effects on plant growth of detrimental drilling fluid components included excess soluble salts, excess exchangeable sodium percentage, possibly a high pH in some mixtures, and undesirable physical conditions. The latter resulted from the sodium and/or starch, gums, and bentonite. Phase II, the second year 2 ̆ 7 s study of the effect of drilling fluid on six soils and on the plant growth (which is this report) was designed to use seven typical drilling fluids at ratios of 1 : 4 (called the low rate), and 1 : 1 (called the high rate) by volume of liquid mud to disturbed and settled soils using green beans and sweet corn as the test plants. The seven mud mixtures were potassium chloride mud (PCM), diesel oil emulsion mud (DOEM), high pH lime mud (HPLM), lignite <b>lignosulfonate</b> <b>sodium</b> mud (LLSM), lignite lignosulfonate potassium mud (LLPM), dichromate mud (DTM), and a mud base (MB). Each mud contained bentonite and barite plus sodium or potassium hydroxide plus a few other substances. Too much soluble salts or too high an exchangeable sodium percentage was the major cause of reduced plant growth. The dispersing problem of mud-treated soils caused by high exchangeable sodium percentages results from the high sodium hydroxide contents added to the muds. Early attempts at leaching the soils with tap water were unsuccessful because of low permeability. Releaching all samples finally with salty water, first with 1 percent Ca(NO 3) 2, and later with 0. 2 percent Ca(NO 3) 2, and finally with tap water was effective and plant growth improved in all mud mixtures. In unleached treatments the muds PCM, DOEM, and DTM were most limiting to plants growth. Reclamation of soils into which drilling fluids (muds) are mixed seems to require primarily (1) the removal of excess salts, and (2) a lowering of the content of exchangeable sodium with some additions of chemical amendments (calcium salts) and adequate leaching...|$|R

Results show that the charge-free aromatic groups of SL tend to form oriented – stacking with the spectroscopic characteristics of J–aggregates. The formation of J–aggregates in SL are recognized by a significant spectral red shift in fluorescent excitation spectra. The other effects that may cause spectral shift, such as the SL species, solvent effect, and the impurities, are investigated {{to confirm that the}} formation of J-aggregates is the only viable explanation for the significant spectral redshift of SL. Salt causes molecular shrinkage of SL polyelectrolytes, but has no influence on J–aggregates of the aromatic groups as detected by lack of spectral shift, indicating that the aromatic groups are charge-free. This suggests that not all the aromatic groups but only the charge-free aromatic groups can form – stacking. This work demonstrates the presence of J–aggregation in aqueous SL solutions for the first time, which gives an insight in understanding the preferred orientation of the aromatic groups in lignin-based biopolymers...|$|E
