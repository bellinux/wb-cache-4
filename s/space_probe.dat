40|$|In this paper, we {{show that}} in the {{presence}} of large-scale circulation (LSC), Taylor's hypothesis can be invoked to deduce the energy spectrum in thermal convection using real <b>space</b> <b>probes,</b> a popular experimental tool. We perform numerical simulation of turbulent convection in a cube and observe that the velocity field follows Kolmogorov's spectrum ($k^{- 5 / 3 }$). We also record the velocity time series using real <b>space</b> <b>probes</b> near the lateral walls. The corresponding frequency spectrum exhibits Kolmogorov's spectrum ($f^{- 5 / 3 }$), thus validating Taylor's hypothesis with the steady LSC playing the role of a mean velocity field. The aforementioned findings based on real <b>space</b> <b>probes</b> provide valuable inputs for experimental measurements used for studying the spectrum of convective turbulence...|$|R
5|$|Voyager 1 was {{initially}} expected to work {{only through the}} Saturn encounter. When the spacecraft passed the planet in 1980, Sagan proposed {{the idea of the}} <b>space</b> <b>probe</b> taking one last picture of Earth. He pointed out that such a picture would not have had much scientific value, as the Earth would appear too small for Voyagers cameras to make out any detail, {{but it could have been}} meaningful nevertheless as a perspective on our place in the universe.|$|E
5|$|Deep Impact was a NASA <b>space</b> <b>probe</b> {{launched}} from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station at 18:47 UTC on January 12, 2005. It {{was designed to}} study the interior composition of the comet Tempel 1 (9P/Tempel), by releasing an impactor into the comet. At 05:52 UTC on July 4, 2005, the impactor successfully collided with the comet's nucleus. The impact excavated debris from {{the interior of the}} nucleus, forming an impact crater. Photographs taken by the spacecraft showed the comet to be more dusty and less icy than had been expected. The impact generated an unexpectedly large and bright dust cloud, obscuring the view of the impact crater.|$|E
5|$|Further {{tests of}} general {{relativity}} include precision measurements of the Shapiro effect or gravitational time delay for light, most recently in 2002 by the Cassini <b>space</b> <b>probe.</b> One set of tests focuses on effects predicted by general relativity for the behavior of gyroscopes travelling through space. One of these effects, geodetic precession, has been tested with the Lunar Laser Ranging Experiment (high-precision measurements of the orbit of the Moon). Another, which is related to rotating masses, is called frame-dragging. The geodetic and frame-dragging effects were both tested by the Gravity Probe B satellite experiment launched in 2004, with results confirming relativity to within 0.5% and 15%, respectively, as of December 2008.|$|E
50|$|Kristin School has a house system {{consisting}} of four houses: Mariner, Jupiter, Apollo, Saturn. The houses are {{named after the}} corresponding <b>space</b> <b>probes</b> launched by NASA. The naming of the houses after the <b>space</b> <b>probes</b> reflects the school's and the greater Albany region's historical origins. Founded in 1973, space exploration was {{at the forefront of}} human progression and the school's houses were named to reflect the same pioneering spirit the founding parents of the school held. Many of the streets in the area reflect the importance of this era also most notably William Pickering Drive. William Pickering was a New Zealand rocket scientist that worked for NASA involved with these <b>space</b> <b>probes.</b> Other such as Constellation and Apollo Drive can be noted.|$|R

5|$|On Thursday May 8, 1997, at 21:42 UTC, BeppoSAX's Gamma Ray Burst Monitor {{registered}} a gamma-ray burst {{that lasted}} approximately 15seconds. It was also detected by Ulysses, a robotic <b>space</b> <b>probe</b> designed {{to study the}} Sun, and by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) on board the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. The burst also occurred {{within the field of}} view of one of BeppoSAX's two X-ray Wide Field Cameras. Within a few hours, the BeppoSAX team localized the burst to an error boxâ€”a small area around the specific position to account for the error in the positionâ€”with a diameter of approximately 10arcminutes.|$|E
5|$|The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) is Japan's space agency; it conducts space, planetary, and {{aviation}} research, {{and leads}} development of rockets and satellites.

The <b>space</b> <b>probe</b> Akatsuki was launched May 20, 2010, and achieved orbit around Venus on December 9, 2015. Japan's plans in space exploration include: developing the Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter to be launched in 2016; and building a moon base by 2030.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of space travel gave scientists {{the opportunity to}} study the comet at close quarters, and several probes were launched to do so. The Soviet Vega 1 started returning images of Halley on 4 March 1986, and the first ever of its nucleus, and made its flyby on 6 March, followed by Vega 2 making its flyby on 9 March. On 14 March, the Giotto <b>space</b> <b>probe,</b> launched by the European Space Agency, made the closest pass of the comet's nucleus. There were also two Japanese probes, Suisei and Sakigake. The probes were unofficially known as the Halley Armada.|$|E
