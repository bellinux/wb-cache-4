Patterson and {{his brother}} took over the company, cash {{registers}} were expensive ($50 USD) and only about a dozen of [...] "Ritty's Incorruptible Cashier" [...] machines were in use. There was little demand for the expensive device, but Patterson believed the product would sell once shopkeepers understood it would drastically decrease theft by salesclerks. He created a sales team known as the [...] "American Selling Force" [...] which worked on commissions and followed a standard sales script, the [...] "N.C.R. Primer." [...] The philosophy was to sell a business function rather than {{just a piece of}} machinery. Sales demonstrations were set up in hotels (away from the distractions of the buyer's business) depicting a store interior complete with real merchandise and real cash. The <b>sale</b> <b>prospect</b> was described as the [...] "P.P." [...] or [...] "Probable Purchaser." [...] Once initial objections were swept aside and the P.P. admitted to internal theft losses, the product was demonstrated along with large business charts and diagrams. The deal was sealed with a 25 cent cigar.|$|E

40|$|Full-cost {{transfer}} pricing {{has been criticized}} for providing production units with insufficient incentives to economize. Our empirical study based on data from a large producer of consumer goods shows that charging fullcost transfer prices to downstream sales units can send upstream production units into a death spiral.

We observe that managers focus their cost-cutting efforts on unit variable costs and on products with the best <b>sales</b> <b>prospects.</b> These results also suggest that, when production units are at risk of falling into a death spiral, full-cost {{transfer pricing}} can serve as a credible commitment device to motivate managers to reduce costs...|$|R

The Saab JAS Gripen, in comparison, costs only US$4,700 per flight-hour to operate. According to a 2009 article by the Institute for Defense Studies and Analysis, unlike the American government and its relationship with Boeing and Lockheed Martin, the lack of communication between the French government and Dassault has hampered a worldwide cooperative sales effort, as demonstrated by the case with Morocco in 2007.|$|R
