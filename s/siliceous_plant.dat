5000|$|Phytoliths (from Greek, [...] "plant stone") are rigid, {{microscopic}} structures made of silica, {{found in}} some plant tissues and persisting after the decay of the plant. These plants take up silica from the soil, whereupon it is deposited within different intracellular and extracellular structures of the plant. Phytoliths come in varying shapes and sizes. Although some use [...] "phytolith" [...] to refer to all mineral secretions by plants, it more commonly refers to <b>siliceous</b> <b>plant</b> remains. In contrast, mineralized calcium secretions in cacti are composed of calcium oxalates.|$|E

The phytoliths found are compared with those extracted from extant plants and other Antarctic sedimentary deposits. The phytolith record is also compared with the three floral assemblages indicated by terrestrial palynomorphs for the Miocene and Quaternary sections of the core...|$|E
40|$|Unayzah Group {{correlation}} in Saudi Arabia is {{hindered by}} the lack of terrestrial fossils preserved in oxidized red-beds. Phytoliths are biogenic <b>siliceous</b> <b>plant</b> infillings and casts resistant to oxidation. In previous studies the presence of Biogenic Silica microfossils (Phytoliths) in Unayzah Group deposits were confirmed. Although some may have been deposited by wind, we believe the bulk of the phytoliths preserved within the Unayzah red-beds comprise the remains of both hot- and cool-desert, restricted plant communities (i. e., biocoenoses) that persisted during deposition of the upper Unayzah. New Phytolith fossils observed in the present study and from Permian red-beds from Texas demonstrate a clear link with Permian plants species...|$|E
40|$|Biosilicification {{has driven}} {{variation}} in the global Si cycle over geologic time. The evolution of different eukaryotic lineages that convert dissolved Si (DSi) into mineralized structures (higher <b>plants,</b> <b>siliceous</b> sponges, radiolarians, and diatoms) has driven a secular decrease in DSi in the global ocean leading to the low DSi concentrations seen today. Recent studies, however, have questioned the timing previously proposed for the DSi decreases and the concentration changes through deep time, which would have major implications for the cycling of carbon and other key nutrients in the ocean. Here, we combine relevant genomic data with geological data and present new hypotheses regarding {{the impact of the}} evolution of biosilicifying organisms on the DSi inventory of the oceans throughout deep time. Although there is no fossil evidence for true silica biomineralization until the late Precambrian, the timing of the evolution of silica transporter genes suggests that bacterial silicon-related metabolism has been present in the oceans since the Archean with eukaryotic silicon metabolism already occurring in the Neoproterozoic. We hypothesize that biological processes have influenced oceanic DSi concentrations since the beginning of oxygenic photosynthesis...|$|R
40|$|Cucurbita (squash and gourd) phytoliths {{recovered}} from two early Holocene archaeological sites in southwestern Ecuador and directly dated to 10, 130 to 9320 carbon- 14 {{years before the}} present (about 12, 000 to 10, 000 cal-endar years ago) are identified as derived from domesticated plants because they are considerably larger than those from modern wild taxa. The be-ginnings of plant husbandry {{appear to have been}} preceded by the exploi-tation of a wild species of Cucurbita during the terminal Pleistocene. These data provide evidence for an independent emergence of plant food pro-duction in lowland South America that was contemporaneous with or slight-ly before that in highland Mesoamerica. The transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture {{was one of the most}} important economic and social passages of human pre-history, and the topic has long been a focus of archaeological research. Studies in dry high-land regions of Mesoamerica show that plant domestication had occurred by 9000 years before the present (yr B. P.) (about 10, 000 calendar years ago) (1, 2). However, empiri-cal research in the lowland Neotropics, long hypothesized to have been another indepen-dent center of agricultural origins (3), has been impeded by the poor preservation of plant remains. Here we describe early plant domestication in Ecuador using an analysis of phytoliths: microscopic <b>siliceous</b> remains of <b>plants</b> that survive in humid environments over long periods of time (4) ...|$|R
6000|$|... [122] On Petermann's map of Africa, in Stieler's Hand-Atlas (1879), the Island of Ascension {{is shown}} as {{seated on a}} much larger and {{shallower}} submarine bank than St. Helena. The 1,000 fathom line round Ascension encloses an oval space 170 miles long by 70 wide, and even the 300 fathom line, one over 60 miles long; and it is therefore probable that a much larger island once occupied this site. Now Ascension is nearly equidistant between St. Helena and Liberia, and such an island might have served as an intermediate station through which many of the immigrants to St. Helena passed. As the distances are hardly greater than {{in the case of}} the Azores, this removes whatever difficulty may have been felt of the possibility of any organisms reaching so remote an island. The present island of Ascension is probably only the summit of a huge volcanic mass, and any remnant of the original fauna and flora it might have preserved may have been destroyed by great volcanic eruptions. Mr. Darwin collected some masses of tufa which were found to be mainly organic, containing, besides remains of fresh-water infusoria, the <b>siliceous</b> tissue of <b>plants!</b> In the light of the great extent of the submarine bank on which the island stands, Mr. Darwin's remark, that--"we may feel sure, that at some former epoch, the climate and productions of Ascension were very different from what they are now,"--has received a striking confirmation.

40|$|Anthropogenic midden {{deposits}} {{are remarkably}} well preserved at the Neolithic settlement of atalhöyük and provide significant archaeological {{information on the}} types and nature of activities occurring at the site. To decipher their complex stratigraphy and to investigate formation processes, a combination of geoarchaeological techniques was used. Deposits were investigated from the early ceramic to late Neolithic levels, targeting continuous sequences to examine high resolution and broader scale changes in deposition. Thin-section micromorphology combined with targeted phytolith and geochemical analyses indicates they are composed of a diverse range of ashes and other charred and <b>siliceous</b> <b>plant</b> materials, with inputs of decayed plants and organic matter, fecal waste, and sedimentary aggregates, each with diverse depositional pathways. Activities identified include in situ burning, {{with a range of}} different fuel types that may be associated with different activities. The complexity and heterogeneity of the midden deposits, and thus the necessity of employing an integrated microstratigraphic approach is demonstrated, as a prerequisite for cultural and palaeoenvironmental reconstructions...|$|E
40|$|Permo-Carboniferous {{sandstones}} {{are important}} reservoir rocks {{for natural gas}} in the Southern North Sea basin. This is a mature area which makes tools for reservoir characterization and well to well correlation important for field optimalisation and ongoing exploration activities. Within the Permo-Carboniferous sandstone reservoirs of the Dutch on- and offshore there are two key questions which {{still need to be}} resolved. One regards the geological model for the basin infill, another is the detection of the Base Permian Unconformity (BPU), an important regional unconformity. Biostratigraphy is classically used to address these problems. As the traditional microfossil groups are absent in the Permo-Carboniferous redbed deposits, the application of biostratigraphy is seriously hampered. In this study, we present a new biostratigraphical tool based on biogenic silica microfossils (BSPs). This fossil group consists of <b>siliceous</b> <b>plant</b> remains which are preserved even under extreme oxidizing conditions. BSPs are present in the Permo-Carboniferous redbed sequences and are {{now for the first time}} used for biostratigraphical correlations. This new tool holds great potential for independent chronostratigraphical correlations in economically important redbed deposits worldwide. In this study the initial results from a case study in the Southern North Sea basin will be presented...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about silicon as an {{essential}} nutrient in plants, despite the deficiency symptoms associated with rice reproductive structures under silicon deprivation conditions. Silicon concentrations in the embryos of rice, peanut and other plants were compared, {{and the presence of}} silicon in the polynucleic acids (PNA) extracted from embryos of rice (Oryza sativa L.), a <b>siliceous</b> <b>plant,</b> and peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), a calciphilous plant, was demonstrated using molecular sieve chromatography. Silicon co-eluted with RNA and DNA from both rice and peanuts, and the ratio of silicon to RNA or DNA in each fraction differed between plant embryos, and between nucleic acids. The ratio of silicon to DNA was higher than to RNA in both rice and peanut, and was higher in the peanut embryo than in the rice embryo, while silicon to RNA was opposite to the result of DNA. Digestion with DNase or RNase significantly reduced the peak of silicon associated DNA or RNA. Although aluminum was not found in the embryos of plant species except thea and maize, silicon was found in the embryos of all tested plant species. These results indicate that silicon combines with DNA and RNA in the PNA of plant embryos, suggesting that silicon is essential for plant reproduction. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn the Perdasdefogu Basin (Ogliastra, Sardinia) plants {{occurring}} in angular cherts are preserved as <b>siliceous</b> permineralizations. The <b>plant</b> assemblage {{consists of the}} genera Sphenophyllum, Arthropitys, Astromyelon, Palaeostachya, Pecopteris, Scolecopteris, Stewartiopteris, Psaronius, Ankyropteris, Anachoropteris; furthermore, probable medullosan wood and ovules, cordaitean stems, leaves and ovules, and Dadoxylon wood have been recorded. Arborescent marratialean ferns are the dominant elements with Pecopteris and Scolecopteris leaves being the most common; the calamiteans are the second in abundance. Generally the chert blocks contain {{a large number of}} plant fragments [...] roots and leaves are being almost equally represented [...] suggestive of a coal ball-like plant accumulation. More rarely a chert block may consist of a single plant part, for example a piece of wood. The preservation and accumulation of the plants are closely comparable to the silicified plant assemblages described from the Lower Permian of Autun and the upper Pennsylvanian of Grand-Croix (Massif central, France) and from the Early Permian Döhlen Basin (Germany). It is certainly significant that the assemblage from the Perdasdefogu Basin is dominated by tree ferns and calamites like the coeval silicified vegetation from Autun. However, like in Autun, the permineralized flora contrasts with the underlying compression floras dominated by conifers and peltasperms. The Perdasdefogu macroflora record suggest a middle-upper Autunian age which corresponds to the Surmoulin and Millery formations of the Autun Basin. This is in agreement with the Asselian-Sakmarian transition as pointed out by the amphibian species found in the same formation, and perfectly correlatable with the same association found in Gottlob-lake (Thuringian Forest Basin). Because of its rich fossil content, the Perdasdefogu Basin represents a reference succession for the Autunian of the entire westernmost palaeo-Tethyan domain and its macrofloral recor...|$|R
6000|$|A hill formed of {{the older}} series of {{volcanic}} rocks, and which has been incorrectly considered as the crater of a volcano, is remarkable from its broad, slightly hollowed, and circular summit having been filled up with many successive layers of ashes and fine scoriae. These saucer-shaped layers crop out on the margin, forming perfect rings of many different colours, giving to the summit a most fantastic appearance; one of these rings is white and broad, and resembles a course round which horses have been exercised; hence the hill {{has been called the}} Devil's Riding School. I brought away specimens of one of the tufaceous layers of a pinkish colour and it is a most extraordinary fact that Professor Ehrenberg finds it almost wholly composed of matter which has been organised; he detects in it some siliceous-shielded, fresh-water infusoria, and no less than twenty-five different kinds of the <b>siliceous</b> tissue of <b>plants,</b> chiefly of grasses. (21/5. [...] "Monats. der Konig. Akad. d. Wiss. zu Berlin" [...] Vom April 1845.) From the absence of all carbonaceous matter, Professor Ehrenberg believes that these organic bodies have passed through the volcanic fire, and have been erupted in the state in which we now see them. The appearance of the layers induced me to believe that they had been deposited under water, though from the extreme dryness of the climate I was forced to imagine that torrents of rain had probably fallen during some great eruption, and that thus a temporary lake had been formed into which the ashes fell. But it may now be suspected that the lake was not a temporary one. Anyhow we may feel sure that at some former epoch the climate and productions of Ascension were very different from what they now are. Where {{on the face of the}} earth can we find a spot on which close investigation will not discover signs of that endless cycle of change, to which this earth has been, is, and will be subjected? ...|$|R
60|$|Generally the {{atmosphere}} is hazy; and this {{is caused by the}} falling of impalpably fine dust, which was found to have slightly injured the astronomical instruments. The morning before we anchored at Porto Praya, I collected a little packet of this brown-coloured fine dust, which appeared to have been filtered from the wind by the gauze of the vane at the masthead. Mr. Lyell has also given me four packets of dust which fell on a vessel a few hundred miles northward of these islands. Professor Ehrenberg finds that this dust consists in great part of infusoria with siliceous shields, and of the <b>siliceous</b> tissue of <b>plants.</b> (1/3. I must take this opportunity of acknowledging the great kindness with which this illustrious naturalist has examined many of my specimens. I have sent (June 1845) a full account of the falling of this dust to the Geological Society.) In five little packets which I sent him, he has ascertained no less than sixty-seven different organic forms! The infusoria, with the exception of two marine species, are all inhabitants of fresh-water. I have found no less than fifteen different accounts of dust having fallen on vessels when far out in the Atlantic. From the direction of the wind whenever it has fallen, and from its having always fallen during those months when the harmattan is known to raise clouds of dust high into {{the atmosphere}}, we may feel sure that it all comes from Africa. It is, however, a very singular fact, that, although Professor Ehrenberg knows many species of infusoria peculiar to Africa, he finds none of these in the dust which I sent him. On the other hand, he finds in it two species which hitherto he knows as living only in South America. The dust falls in such quantities as to dirty everything on board, and to hurt people's eyes; vessels even have run on shore owing to the obscurity of the atmosphere. It has often fallen on ships when several hundred, and even more than a thousand miles from the coast of Africa, and at points sixteen hundred miles distant in a north and south direction. In some dust which was collected on a vessel three hundred miles from the land, I was much surprised to find particles of stone above the thousandth of an inch square, mixed with finer matter. After this fact one need not be surprised at the diffusion of the far lighter and smaller sporules of cryptogamic plants.|$|R
40|$|Phytoliths (<b>siliceous</b> <b>plant</b> microfossils) {{have been}} {{recovered}} from Cenozoic sediments (c. 34 to 17 Ma) in the CRP- 2 / 2 A and CRP- 3 drillholes cored off Cape Roberts, Victoria Land Basin, Antarctica. The phytolith assemblages are sparse, but well-preserved and dominated by spherical forms {{similar to those of}} modern trees or shrubs. Rare phytoliths comparable to modern grass forms are also present. However, due to the paucity of phytolith data, any interpretations made are necessarily tentative. The assemblages of CRP- 2 / 2 A and the upper c. 250 m of CRP- 3 are interpreted as representing a predominantly woody vegetation, including Nothofagus and Libocedrus with local areas of grass in the more exposed locations. A cool climate is interpreted to have prevailed throughout both cores. However, beneath c. 250 metres below sea floor in CRP- 3, the dominant woody vegetation is supplemented by pockets of Palmae, ?Proteaceae and 'warm' climate grasses. This association represents vegetation growth in sheltered, moist sites - possibly north-facing mid-slopes or the coastal fringe. It may also represent remnant vegetation that grew in moist, temperate conditions during the Middle to Late Eocene, previously interpreted from the Southern McMurdo Sound erratics and lower part of the CIROS- 1 drillhole. The phytolith analysis compares well to the terrestrial palynomorph record from both cores and provides additional independent taxonomic and climatic interpretations...|$|E
