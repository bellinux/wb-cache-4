50|$|Sunglass lenses {{are made}} of either glass, plastic, or SR-91. Plastic lenses are {{typically}} made from acrylic, polycarbonate, CR-39 or polyurethane. Glass lenses have the best optical clarity and scratch resistance, but are heavier than plastic lenses. They can also shatter or break on impact. Plastic lenses are lighter and <b>shatter-resistant,</b> but {{are more prone to}} scratching. Polycarbonate plastic lenses are the lightest, and are also almost shatterproof, making them good for impact protection. CR-39 is the most common plastic lens, due to low weight, high scratch resistance, and low transparency for ultraviolet and infrared radiation. SR-91 is a proprietary material that was introduced by Kaenon Polarized in 2001. Kaenon's lens formulation was the first non-polycarbonate material to pass the high-mass impact ANSI Z.87.1 testing.

When these studies are extended to manned spacecraft, safety becomes a primary concern. The need for a high-pressure, flame-resistant, <b>shatter-resistant</b> window permitting photographic recording of combustion experiments in manned spacecraft prompted the development of a method for bonding Lexan and sapphire. Materials that resist shattering (e. g., Lexan) are not compatible with combustion experiments; the material loses strength at combustion temperatures. Sapphire is compatible with combustion temperatures in oxygen-enriched atmospheres but is subject to shattering. Combining the two materials results in a <b>shatter-resistant,</b> flame-resistant window. Combustion in microgravity produces a low-visibility flame; however, flame propagation and flame characteristics are readily visible as long as there is no deterioration of the image. Since an air gap between the Lexan and the sapphire would reduce transmission, a method was developed for bonding these unlike materials to minimize light loss...|$|E
40|$|Shattering is a {{major problem}} in canola {{production}} worldwide and especially in Australia because the crop matures in summer under hot and windy condition. Little variation for shatter resistance is available in Brassica napus, which is the major canola species. Considerable variation for shatter resistance is available in B. rapa, which is a relatively minor oilseed species. Shatter resistance is being transferred from B. rapa into B. napus by backcrossing. Screening for shatter resistance in canola breeding programs is currently based on mechanical tests of individual siliqua strength. The test, which is time consuming, can only take place with completely dry and mature siliquae. This study aimed to identify molecular markers linked to shatter resistance in a population segregating for this trait, and to develop specific and robust primers to be used in a routine test, for screening for shatter resistance in canola breeding programs. Crosses were made between the shatter-susceptible Canadian cv. Torch of B. rapa L. ssp. oleifera (Metzg.) Sinsk and a <b>shatter-resistant</b> Indian line, DS- 17 -D of B. rapa L. ssp. oleifera var. Brown Sarson (Singh) Prakash. Shatter resistance was found to be a recessive trait controlled by two major genes, designated sh 1 and sh 2. The phenotypic segregation in the F 3 population of this cross fitted a Mendelian ratio of 12 : 3 : 1 for shatter-susceptible (S), intermediate-shattering (M) and <b>shatter-resistant</b> (R) respectively. Further evidence from the phenotypic segregation in 19 F 3 families was in agreement with the FZ ratio of 12 : 3 : 1. Bulked segregant analysis coupled with random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis was applied to both F, and F 3 populations of the cross. Three RAPD markers, designated RAC- 3, RX- 7 and SAC- 20, were identified from the F 3 population. RAC- 3 and RX- 7 appeared to be linked in coupling to sh 1 and sh 2 at approximate distances of 13 cM and 20 cM respectively, whereas SAC- 20 appeared to be linked in repulsion to both of these alleles at approximately 20 cM. The linkage of SAC- 20 to both loci supported a theory of chromosome duplication during evolution of the B. rapa genome. Three pairs of sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) primers designated SCAC- 3, SCX- 7 and SCAC- 20, 21 to 24 bp in length were designed based on the sequences of RAPD markers RAC- 3, RX- 7 and SAC- 20 respectively. Only the SCX- 7 primer produced polymorphic markers corresponding to RX- 7 amplified from 'shatter-resistant' DNA individuals, while SCAC- 3 and SCAC- 20 produced amplified products corresponding to RAC- 3 and SAC- 20 to both <b>shatter-resistant</b> and shatter-susceptible DNA individuals. SCAR SCX- 7 was subsequently tested with other Brassica populations including B. napus and BC,F, of B. napus introgressed with B. rapa to investigate the presence of the sh 2 gene. All lines from the backcross populations possessed the expected SCX- 7 marker {{with the exception of one}} line where the marker was absent. This indicated that <b>shatter-resistant</b> gene sh 2 was present in all these populations except for the one line. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|E

40|$|Shattering of {{siliquae}} causes significant seed loss in canola (Brassica napus) production worldwide. There {{is little}} genetic variation for resistance to shatter in canola and, hence, the trait {{has been studied}} in B. rapa. Previous studies have shown two randomly segregating recessive genes {{to be responsible for}} shatter resistance. Three random amplified polymorphic DNA markers were identified as being linked to shatter resistance using bulked segregant analysis in a F 3 B. rapa population. The population was derived from a cross between a shatter-susceptible Canadian cultivar and a <b>shatter-resistant</b> Indian line. Of the three markers, RAC- 3900 and RX- 71000 were linked to recessive sh 1 and sh 2 alleles, and SAC- 201300 was linked to both dominant Sh 1 and Sh 2 alleles. The common marker for the dominant wild-type allele for the two loci was explained to have resulted from duplication of an original locus and the associated markers through chromosome duplication and rearrangements in the process of evolution of the modern B. rapa from its progenitor that had a lower number of chromosomes. Segregation data from double heterozygous F 3 families, although limited, indicated the markers were not linked to each other and provided further evidence for the duplication hypothesis...|$|E
40|$|Additional contributor: Kechun Zhang (faculty mentor) Methacrylic acid {{is one of}} {{the most}} crucial {{chemical}} feedstocks in the material industry and there is a high quantity demand of methyl methacrylate (MMA) which is the ester form of methacrylic acid. Every year million tons of methyl methacrylate is produced to synthesize polymethyl metharylate (PMMA) which is a thermoplastic material and it is used as a light or <b>shatter-resistant</b> alternative to glass. Therefore, to come up with a method for producing methacrylic acid and methyl methacrylate becomes a popular topic of research in biosynthesis area. There are several traditional methods being used in the industry and the most common one is reacting acetone with hydrogen cyanide to generate acetone cyanohydrins and then treat it with sulfuric acid to form methyl methacrylate. However, because of side products and reaction condition, these two traditional methods require high quality of controlling harmful chemicals and hard to increase the yield of target product. What’s worse, the reactants are not renewable and emission will damage the environment. However, we have designed a new biosynthesis strategy to produce methacrylic acid. In this proposed work, glucose is converted to isobutyrate or 3 -Hydroxyisobutyrate.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Chemical EngineeringLarry E. EricksonPolycarbonate {{products}} {{have been used}} extensively world wide for decades because they are lightweight, <b>shatter-resistant</b> and considered to be safe. Polycarbonate is a thermoplastic {{that is used to}} make compact discs, phones, lenses, and food contact products such as water bottles, baby bottles and food storage containers. For more than half century, there has been interest in polycarbonate (PC) products and the monomer bisphenol-A (BPA) because BPA can leach from food polycarbonate containers. The environmental fate for both chemicals in air, water and soil is of interest, also. To understand the fate of polycarbonate, its main degradation pathways, main degradation mechanisms and main products are reviewed. These pathways are thermal degradation, photo-degradation and hydrolysis under different conditions. Furthermore, key topics like PC degradation kinetics and PC chemical resistance are part of this comprehensive discussion. The biodegradation of BPA has been thoroughly studied. About twelve lab methods for environmental fate are summarized and reviewed to understand the “big picture” for BPA degradation. This includes screening tests, which assess the ready and inherent degradability, to simulation tests for surface waters, soils and wastewater treatment systems. The testing of all methods is examined under conditions close to the real environment fate. Furthermore, the fate distribution for BPA based on the Equilibrium Criterion Model (EQC) model is reviewed. Extensive research on polycarbonate and BPA has been conducted in the last fifty years. During this time, both chemicals have been studied and tested by industry and government agencies. The pharmacological test results from major studies indicate that consumer exposure to BPA at concentrations normally experienced in daily living does not pose a risk to human health. On the other hand, minor toxicological studies indicate potential risks to human health. Research on health and safety are continuing...|$|E
