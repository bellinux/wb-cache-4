This rule is occasionally broken where {{a very large number}} of spokes is used or the wheel is unusually small in diameter, either of which reduces the amount of increased tensile stress on each radial spoke to an acceptable degree; some BMX bicycles and low-riders use radial <b>spoking</b> for both wheels. Rear wheels may also incorporate radial <b>spoking</b> on the non-drive side and semi-tangential <b>spoking</b> on the drive side.

50|$|Wire spokes can be radial to the hub but {{are more}} often mounted {{tangentially}} to the hub. Tangential <b>spoking</b> allows for the transfer of torque between the rim and the hub. Tangential spokes are thus necessary for the drive wheel, which has torque at the hub from pedalling, and any wheels using hub-mounted brakes such as disk or band brakes, which transfer torque from the rim to the brake in the opposite direction—(via the hub) when braking.|$|E

5000|$|The {{most common}} <b>spoking</b> pattern is [...] "three-cross" [...] where each spoke crosses three {{others on the}} same flange of the hub before meeting the rim. The last cross is {{normally}} [...] "interlaced" [...] by wrapping the spoke around the {{one from the other}} side of the flange. Radial-spoked wheels, where the spokes do not cross each other, saves roughly the weight of two spokes (because the spokes are shorter) compared to a three-cross wheel but run an increased risk of cracking at the hub flange, unless the hub is specifically designed for this pattern. Two-cross is sometimes used for hubs with large-diameter flanges (such as generator/dynamo hubs or large flange hubs), as it gives a more perpendicular spoke/rim angle, and four-cross is standard for spoke counts of 40 and above.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the long}} history of bicycle wheels, there has been very few design changes because the current design is known to work. This study aimed to develop a method to provide {{optimised}} <b>spoking</b> geometries for rear bicycle wheels. MATLAB® was used to optimise the spoke geometries based on the best combination of torsional and lateral stiffness. The developed script can be easily adapted to calculate the optimised geometry for any wheel with tensioned spokes. The load responses of the optimised wheels were then compared with conventional 2 X and 3 X spoke patterns and three commercially available wheels using ANSYS® FEA software. When the optimised geometries were simulated in ANSYS® under torsional, radial and lateral loads, their performance was better than the conventionally spoked and commercial wheels that had similar specifications. These results confirmed that wheel design can be improved. The recommended guidelines produced in this study only apply to the wheel geometries contain herein, as certain limits were imposed on the hub flange radius and the spoke diameters. Limitations on the use of existing theoretical models have also been identified. ...|$|E

40|$|An ablative, quasi-steady {{electromagnetic}} plasma accelerator {{is tested}} to quantify various characteristics of its operation. An array of diagnostics {{are used to}} characterize a gallium plasma produced by an arc discharge with current levels {{in the range of}} 5. 6 - 22. 6 kA. Discharge current and arc voltage measurements yield arc impedance values in the range of 6 - 7 milliohms at peak current. The absence of high-frequency oscillations in the arc voltage trace indicates lack of the ``onset" condition often seen in MPD arcs, suggesting that a sufficient number of charge carriers are present for current conduction. It is found that the mass bit varies quadratically with the discharge current which yields a calculated exhaust velocity of 20 km/s. A perpendicular probe and time-of-flight method yield on-axis exhaust velocities in the range of 15 - 22 km/s that is found to be invariant with the discharge current. Macroparticle ejection is unavoidable when testing with a central anode; this is possibly due to the presence of high-current density anode spots present on the gallium surface. A spatially and temporally broad spectroscopic survey in the 220 - 520 nm range is used to determine which species are present in the plasma. The spectra show that neutral, singly, and doubly ionized gallium atomic and ionic species are present in the discharge. Axial triple Langmuir probe measurements yield electron temperatures in the range of 0. 8 - 3. 6 eV and electron densities in the range of 8 e 20 - 2 e 22 electrons per meter cubed. The plasma expands isentropically with divergence half-angles in the range of 16 - 20 degrees. Spatially resolved magnetic field probe data reveals a symmetric arc discharge with no evidence of the current <b>spoking</b> instability. A power balance model is coupled with a sheath model to yield values of the electric field, temperature, and current density at the surface of the cathode...|$|E
40|$|The thesis investigates from a sociolinguistic {{perspective}} {{the use of}} accent as a {{tool for}} building characters in five Cuban cartoon movies. As other similar studies on the field (Androutsopoulos; Lippi-Green; Dobrow & Gidney; Sønnesyn), it claims that the accent potentially gives information about a character or certain character types, as accent is a device loaded with attitudes. This means that some accents will more frequently be used by for example the heroes than the villains. The five films studied are the full-length films made about the legend of Elpidio Valdés and legend of the Vampires in Havana. These two legends are the most successful cartoons produced by the Cuban Institute of Cinematic Art and Industry (ICAIC) and are therefore considered having certain cultural value in Cuba. The method used is a combination of a linguistic and social contextual analysis. With a repertoire analysis of the characters it is detected that the films show a great variation of different accents; what the thesis arguments is related to a variated language ideology. This means that the object of the investigation differs from other films studied, as for examples Disney movies that are considered promoting a standard language ideology where the far most used accent is a standard accent. However, it must be mentioned that the films studied in this thesis use mostly accents that are close to the accent <b>spoking</b> in the capital of Cuba. With {{a closer look at the}} accent used by the heroes, the thesis finds out that both films use the accent to characterize the heroes as non-typical heroes. It also finds out that female characters are underrepresented compared to male characters, though they don’t show less language variation. Considering social contextual factors, it is argued that the way accent is used is highly related to the fact that Cuban cinema is produced for an artistic proposal, not commercial, and made for a national audience; the Cubans...|$|E
