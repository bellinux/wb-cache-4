40|$|We {{investigate}} whether insurers base their <b>solvency</b> <b>margins</b> on risk factors even when operating under a supervisory regime where minimum solvency requirements {{do not fully}} take such risk factors into account. To do this, we use a dataset of about 350 Dutch insurers from all major lines of business during the pre-Solvency II period 1995 - 2005. We find that the levels of insurers' actual <b>solvency</b> <b>margins</b> are related to their risk characteristics and not to regulatory solvency requirements. Consequently, {{the vast majority of}} insurers hold much more capital than required, i. e. non-risk based capital requirements generally are not binding. Requirements are found to affect solvency adjustment behaviour, though. More specifically, below-target capital ratios are raised most rapidly by those insurers whose targets are relatively close to the regulatory minimum. One implication from our results is that, because insurers already follow a risk-based approach, the transition to the new European regulatory framework, Solvency II, is likely to be smooth.

40|$|In the Finnish {{statutory}} {{employment pension}} scheme all the pension institutions {{have a common}} technical interest rate for the pension reserves. This interest rate is determined for each year, and {{it may also be}} changed during the year. In all cases, the interest rate is decided in advance before the period in which it is applied and before the actual investment results are known for certain. The law prescribes that both the security of the pensions and the obtainable investment yield {{must be taken into account}} when the technical interest rate is determined. This paper describes the method that was developed by the Interest Rate Working Group in the year 1998. The maximum obtainable investment yield is estimated using the Markowitz efficient frontier model, which gives the optimal mean values of the investment yield associated with different standard deviations. The standard deviations are then connected with the level of the <b>solvency</b> <b>margin</b> by specifying the risk of fal-ling to a statutory solvency limit. The result is the expected value of the obtainable investment yield as a function of the level of the <b>solvency</b> <b>margin.</b> The interest rate is then calculated by including terms that take into account the growth rate of the reserves and the short term level of the yields. The method does not produce the technical interest rate directly but rather gives a basis to assist in determining the proper level of the interest rate. 395...|$|E

The aim is to construct a probabilistic model describing probability densities for the surplus of a portfolio in such a way that the classical trajectory satisfying a 2 nd order differential equation is obtained as an expected trajectory.

The analysis indicates that, over the calendar years 1991 - 1996, the weighted average reserve error was- 1. 3 % {{as a percentage of}} total OLT assets and – 5. 7 % as a percentage of capital. The figures show that companies the UK general insurance market generally tend to over-reserve, with this feature becoming progressively more prominent in the 1990 s. Many factors can lead to loss reserve errors. The difficulty in estimating the magnitude and timing of future claims naturally involves some estimation errors, and insurers will want to estimate their liabilities with a degree of prudence. However the empirical evidence from the calendar-year regulatory returns of 113 UK general insurance companies over a six-year period suggests that reserve errors in a calendar year have the effect of reducing future dividends and taxation payments. There is little evidence that reserve errors are related to a desire to increase or even smooth future gross profits or improve <b>solvency</b> <b>margins...</b>|$|R

Modeling Financial Scenarios: A Framework for the Actuarial Profession This paper summarizes the research project on Modeling of Economic Series Coordinated with Interest Rate Scenarios initiated by the joint request for proposals by the Casualty Actuarial Society and the Society of Actuaries. The project involved the construction of a financial scenario model that simulates a variety of economic variables over a 50 year period. The variables projected by this model include interest rates, inflation, equity returns, dividend yields, real estate returns, and unemployment rates. This paper contains a description of the key issues involved in modeling these series, a review of the primary literature in this area, an explanation of parameter selection issues, and an illustration of the model’s output.
