40|$|A multiwave study {{examined}} how high school students’ peer relationships impact with their <b>academic</b> motivation, <b>social</b> motivation, <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement. Students’ motivation was framed {{in terms of}} Achievement Goal Theory and their peer relationships were measured using social network analysis. The three overarching research objectives were: 1) to describe the dynamic nature {{of the high school}} peer <b>social</b> networks <b>and</b> students’ <b>academic</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> motivation, 2) to understand the relationships and predictive influence among students’ academic goals, social goals, peer network position, <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement across the school year, and 3) to examine the impact of peers’ <b>academic</b> goals, <b>social</b> goals, <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement on students’ own goals and achievement. Students (n = 851) at a U. S. Midwestern public high school completed surveys at three time points: the beginning, middle, and end of the 2010 - 2011 school year. Results demonstrated that students’ academic goals, social goals, network position, <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement changed across the school year and that there were several grade level, gender, and race differences. Structural equation models provided evidence that <b>academic</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> variables served as both predictors and outcomes, supporting the notion that these processes and outcomes are reciprocally influential. Students’ social goals stood out as especially important for influencing positive changes in <b>social</b> network position <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement across the school year. Academic achievement also emerged as an important predictor of change in students’ <b>academic</b> goals, <b>social</b> goals, <b>and</b> <b>social</b> network position. Furthermore, changes in students’ <b>academic</b> goals, <b>social</b> goals, <b>and</b> <b>academic</b> achievement were predicted by the average levels of motivation and achievement of the peers with whom they regularly interacted at school. The present study thus provided a comprehensive demonstration of the importance of peers for students’ academic development.
