5|$|He was {{reinstated}} by White after promising good behavior, {{and went}} back to Richmond with Virginia and her mother. He remained at the Messenger until January 1837. During this period, Poe claimed that its circulation increased from 700 to 3,500. He published several poems, book reviews, critiques, and <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> paper. On May 16, 1836, he and Virginia Clemm held a Presbyterian wedding ceremony at their Richmond boarding house, with a witness falsely attesting Clemm's age as 21.|$|E

5|$|In early 2003, Angel {{performed}} at {{the release of the}} new branding for Miller Lite beer in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on the 80th anniversary of Houdini's last performance in that city. For the performance, he was suspended ten <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air and bound in a straitjacket, from which he escaped. He also performed an illusion at Ozzfest in 2005. During this period Angel also earned money selling signed merchandise, making up to $50,000 a day.|$|E
5|$|On the exterior, the two {{and three}} lower <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{respective}} buildings were of red sandstone, while {{the balance of the}} work to the roof-line was red brick and red terracotta. The building rested on solid rock and contained a fireproof steel frame. The first and second floors contained public spaces. The Waldorf-Astoria Cigar Company was housed in the basement.|$|E
5|$|Poe had {{intended}} to collect {{a number of his}} early short stories into a volume titled Tales of the Folio Club in the 1830s. The collection would be unified as a series of tales presented by members of a literary club designed as burlesques of contemporary literary criticism. Poe had previously printed several of these <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Philadelphia Saturday Courier and the Baltimore Saturday Visiter.|$|E

5|$|Some {{of these}} sources may {{originally}} have been oral works. A {{number of the}} <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> narrative parts of the Liber resemble Scandinavian sagas, including the story about King Cnut visiting the monastery and singing an Anglo-Saxon song to the assembled monks.

5|$|Stories of mythical Orcadian demons are {{recorded}} in the 16th-century Latin manuscripts of Jo Ben, {{who may have been}} referring to the nuckelavee in his description of the Orkney island of Stronsay.

5|$|According to Liz Tynan from James Cook University, the Maralinga {{tests were}} a {{striking}} {{example of what}} can happen when the popular media are unable to report on activities that the government may be trying to hide. Maralinga was an example of extreme secrecy, but by the late 1970s there was a marked change in how the Australian media covered the British nuclear tests. Some resourceful investigative journalists emerged, whistle-blowers such as Avon Hudson spoke out and political scrutiny became more intense. The investigative journalist Brian Toohey ran a series of <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Australian Financial Review in October 1978, based in part on a leaked Cabinet submission.|$|E
5|$|As Thrilling Wonder the {{magazine}} was much less influential. Until the mid-1940s it was focused on younger readers, {{and by the time}} Merwin and Mines introduced a more adult approach, Astounding Science Fiction had taken over as the unquestioned leader of the field. Thrilling Wonder could not compete with John Campbell and the Golden Age of science fiction that he brought into being, but it did periodically publish good <b>stories.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> end it was unable to escape its roots in the pulp industry, and died in the carnage that swept away every remaining pulp magazine in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} pilot, Miller {{structured}} each episode by telling two <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> episode. The {{first was a}} traditional procedural plotline. The second story was a flashback from Henry's past. The flashback either related to the episode's main present-day storyline, such as Henry's involvement in investigating the Jack the Ripper case, or was a scene from Henry's backstory, such as {{his life in the}} Lower East Side's tenements in the 1890s. Both the father-son relationship between Henry and Abe and one of the two season-long story arcs, Henry's relationship with his wife Abigail, were told through flashbacks.|$|E

5|$|Benn's mother, Margaret Wedgwood Benn (née Holmes, 1897–1991), was a theologian, {{feminist and}} the founder President of the Congregational Federation. She {{was a member of}} the League of the Church Militant, which was the {{predecessor}} of the Movement for the Ordination of Women; in 1925, she was rebuked by Randall Davidson, the Archbishop of Canterbury, for advocating the ordination of women. His mother's theology had a profound influence on Benn, as she taught him that the <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bible were based around the struggle between the prophets and the kings and that he ought in his life to support the prophets over the kings, who had power, as the prophets taught righteousness.|$|E
5|$|Davies' {{writing and}} Tate's {{performance}} were acclaimed, and the episode was praised for its depiction of dystopia in a scene, characterised by the internment {{of a foreign}} citizen. The episode was the fourth most-watched programme in the week it was broadcast, with 8.1 million viewers, and the Appreciation Index of the episode was 88, considered excellent. The episode {{was one of two}} Doctor Who <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fourth series to be nominated for a Hugo Award in the Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form category.|$|E
5|$|Following The Red Sea Sharks (1958) and {{its large}} number of characters, Tintin in Tibet differs from other <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series in that it {{features}} only a few familiar characters and is also Hergé's only adventure not to pit Tintin against an antagonist. Themes in Hergé's story include extrasensory perception, the mysticism of Tibetan Buddhism, and friendship. Tintin in Tibet has been translated into 32 languages, is highly regarded by critics, and has been praised by the Dalai Lama, who awarded it the Light of Truth Award. The story was a commercial success and was published in book form by Casterman shortly after its conclusion; the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. Tintin in Tibet was adapted for television, radio, documentary, theatre, and a video game, and {{has been the subject}} of a museum exhibition.|$|E

5|$|Hebel was {{interested}} in botany, natural history and other subjects. His literary work began with Allemannische Gedichte, which {{is perhaps the most}} popular work written in Alemannic. He had success with his calendar <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Badischer Landkalender, and later with Rheinländischer Hausfreund (Rhenish family friend), but a dispute between Catholics forced him to resign as editor of the calendar. In his last years he devoted himself increasingly to religion, becoming a prelate in 1819, but his wish to become a parish priest was never fulfilled. His last works were biblical stories for young readers, which served as textbooks until 1855. Hebel died 1826 in Schwetzingen. Goethe, Tolstoy, Gottfried Keller, Hermann Hesse and other writers have praised his works.|$|E
5|$|Image Entertainment {{released}} {{the film in}} both the English and Italian versions on DVD on August 1, 2000. Kino {{released the}} film on Blu-ray and DVD on July 16, 2013. Kino's edition of the film was mastered in high definition from the 35mm negative with the Italian language dub and original soundtrack. Arrow Films released Black Sabbath on DVD and Blu-ray in 2013. Arrow's transfer of the Italian version was from an original 35mm internegative print transferred in Italy that had additional grading and restoration done in London. Arrow's version of the American version of Black Sabbath was made from an 35mm interpositive in California. Arrow noted the high definition master they received from Italy {{was very difficult to}} restore as the master had issues with the image, sound and color quality and had the <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wrong order.|$|E

Nevertheless, Mengsk rebuilds and the Dominion remains the dominant Terran power. In Frontline, many of the <b>stories</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> anthology paint Mengsk and the Dominion overall as tyrannical and corrupt, no different from the Confederacy.|$|E
