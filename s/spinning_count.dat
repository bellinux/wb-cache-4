40|$|Full {{counting}} statistics is {{a powerful}} tool to characterize the noise and correlations in transport through mesoscopic systems. In this work, we propose the theory of conditional <b>spin</b> <b>counting</b> statistics, i. e., the statistical fluctuations of spin-up (down) current given the observation of the spin-down (up) current. In the context of transport through a single quantum dot, it is demonstrated that a strong Coulomb interaction leads to a conditional <b>spin</b> <b>counting</b> statistics that exhibits a substantial change in comparison to that without Coulomb repulsion. It thus can be served as {{an effective way to}} probe the Coulomb interactions in mesoscopic transport systems. In case of spin polarized transport, it is further shown that the conditional <b>spin</b> <b>counting</b> statistics offers a transparent tool to reveal the spin-resolved bunching behavior.

40|$|The ideas {{behind the}} {{development}} and detection of multiple quantum coherence in ensembles of dipolar coupled spin 1 / 2 systems are developed. An rf pulse sequence for a single quantum propagator which creates multiple quantum coherence in steps of single quanta was developed and examined to {{for use as a}} tool for <b>spin</b> <b>counting</b> in solids. Experimental details concerning the manipulations necessary to produce multiple quantum NMR spectra are presented. Experimental results from time-resolved multiple quantum NMR studies using the propagator are shown and discussed for materials with a uniform distribution of spins (adamantane) and for a system of isolated spin clusters with finite numbers of spins (liquid crystal);The multiple quantum (MQ) <b>spin</b> <b>counting</b> was applied to identify reaction intermediates in heterogeneous catalysis. <b>Spin</b> <b>counting</b> was shown to yield an upper limit of n = 6 for strongly bound, rigid intermediates CmHn in the reaction of ethylene over Ru/SiO 2. The results eliminated the possibility of major components of such intermediates being polymer-like coke precursors. A precursor to 2 -butene such as Ru-CH 2 -CH=CH-CH 2 -Ru was proposed as one possible intermediate which is in accord with the experimental observations;Another application of multiple quantum <b>spin</b> <b>counting</b> was performed in order to characterize the local structure of silica in supported Ru/SiO 2 catalysts. Cab-O-Sil HS 5 used as the support in silica supported ruthenium (Ru/SiO 2) catalysts was characterized via single and multiple quantum (MQ) 1 H NMR spectroscopy. The samples were studied both in the presence and the absence of ruthenium. Single quantum <b>spin</b> <b>counting</b> of protons on a silica support with and without ruthenium metal indicated that the total number of hydroxyl groups decreased significantly with increasing reduction temperature over the range of 350 - 530 ∘C. Two different components shown in static 1 H NMR were found to reveal homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening via spectral hole burning experiments. 1 H MQ-NMR <b>spin</b> <b>counting,</b> {{based on the number of}} MQ coherences observed, showed the existence of small clusters of proton spins on the silica surface. The maximum measured cluster size was 6 - 7, or less spins. Segments of silica resembling the 100 face of cristobalite on the surface are postulated to be possible sites for the clusters. The clusters in pure silica became smaller as the reduction temperature increased over 500 ∘C. No such change was detected in the presence of ruthenium...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} Full Counting Statistics of non-commuting {{variables}} with {{the measurement of}} successive <b>spin</b> <b>counts</b> in non-collinear directions taken as an example. We show that owing to an irreducible detector back-action, the FCS in this case may {{be sensitive to the}} dynamics of the detectors, and may differ from the predictions obtained with using a naive version of the Projection Postulate. We present here a general model of detector dynamics and path-integral approach to the evaluation of FCS. We concentrate further on a simple "diffusive" model of the detector dynamics where the FCS can be evaluated with transfer-matrix method. The resulting probability distribution of <b>spin</b> <b>counts</b> is characterized by anomalously large higher cumulants and substantially deviates from Gaussian Statistics.

40|$|Five type II kerogens, {{shown by}} {{elemental}} analysis and Rock-Eval pyrolysis {{to represent a}} gradient of thermal maturity, were further characterized using a range of solid-state ¹³C NMR spectroscopic techniques. ¹³C cross polarization (CP) NMR spectra of the kerogens confirmed the well-established pattern of increasing aromaticity with increasing thermal maturity. <b>Spin</b> <b>counting</b> showed that CP observability was around 50 % for the immature kerogens, and only 14 – 25 % for the mature kerogens. <b>Spin</b> <b>counting</b> also showed that the direct polarization (DP) observabilities were > 80 % for {{all but one of}} the kerogens.

The {{impact of}} inefficient cross {{polarization}} (long TCH values), caused by long 13 C- 1 H internuclear distances, on 13 C CPMAS NMR spectra of charred and uncharred woods {{is determined by}} simultaneously fitting data from complementary variable spin lock and variable contact time experiments. As expected, the impact is minimal for uncharred woods, but is very significant for the charred woods. Quantification of the decrease in CPMAS signal intensity caused by both inefficient cross polarization and rapid T 1 rhoH relaxation is achieved using an advanced <b>spin</b> <b>counting</b> methodology, for which the term "spin accounting" is proposed. 13 C CPMAS NMR observabilities determined using the spin accounting methodology were close to 100 % for the uncharred samples, and 69 - 82 % for the charred samples.
