5|$|In 1932, Schleswig-Holstein was re-boilered and {{converted}} into a cadet training ship. One {{of the most significant}} changes visually was the trunking of the two forward funnels into a single larger <b>smoke</b> <b>stack.</b> Schlesien was made the flagship of the battleship squadron in January 1933. In May 1935, the Reichsmarine was again reorganized as the Kriegsmarine. By this time, only Schlesien and Schleswig-Holstein were still operating as warships; the four Braunschweig-class ships had been disposed of or {{converted into a}}uxiliary ships.|$|E
25|$|DM {{were the}} only Yellowstones to have a {{high-capacity}} pedestal or centipede tender, and had roller bearings on all axles. Some of the locomotives had a cylindrical Elesco feedwater heater ahead of the <b>smoke</b> <b>stack,</b> while others had a Worthington unit with its rectangular box in the same location.|$|E
25|$|In a {{turbulent}} flow, {{there is a}} range of scales of the time-varying fluid motion. The size of the largest scales of fluid motion (sometimes called eddies) are set by the overall geometry of the flow. For instance, in an industrial <b>smoke</b> <b>stack,</b> the largest scales of fluid motion are {{as big as the}} diameter of the stack itself. The size of the smallest scales is set by the Reynolds number. As the Reynolds number increases, smaller and smaller scales of the flow are visible. In a <b>smoke</b> <b>stack,</b> the smoke may appear to have many very small velocity perturbations or eddies, in addition to large bulky eddies. In this sense, the Reynolds number is an indicator of the range of scales in the flow. The higher the Reynolds number, the greater the range of scales. The largest eddies will always be the same size; the smallest eddies are determined by the Reynolds number.|$|E

25|$|Harding {{contacted}} the rail traffic controller in Farnham {{to advise that}} the train was secure. Next, he {{contacted the}} rail traffic controller in Bangor, Maine, to report that the lead locomotive had experienced mechanical difficulties throughout the trip and that excessive black and white smoke was coming from its <b>smoke</b> <b>stack.</b> Expecting the smoke to settle, they agreed {{to deal with the}} situation the following morning.|$|E
25|$|In contrast, {{the levels}} of other air {{pollutants}} and non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions from combustion depend on the precise technology applied when fuel is combusted. These emissions are basically caused by either incomplete combustion of {{a small fraction of}} the fuel (carbon monoxide, methane, non-methane volatile organic compounds) or by complicated chemical and physical processes during the combustion and in the <b>smoke</b> <b>stack</b> or tailpipe. Examples of these are particulates, NOx, a mixture of nitric oxide, NO, and nitrogen dioxide, NO2).|$|E
25|$|Both the pusher and {{the barge}} {{suffered}} extensive damages from the accident. When the cargo shifted, {{the port side}} coamings and ramp were cut at the deck level and disappeared to the sea along with the cargo. As Finn-Baltic drifted towards the shallows, the superstructure and <b>smoke</b> <b>stack</b> of the pusher and the remaining parts of the coamings of the barge were crushed and mangled when they {{came into contact with}} the seafloor — large parts of the superstructure were later recovered for investigation along the drifting path. Some minor damage was also caused by the rightening operation.|$|E

50|$|Two tall <b>smoke</b> <b>stacks</b> towered {{above the}} forward {{part of the}} {{hurricane}} deck and the 'scape pipes were in the rear, venting steam from the engines.|$|R
25|$|Drake was mortally wounded. The {{loss of her}} <b>smoke</b> <b>stack</b> {{prevented}} a proper draft to her boilers to form {{a full head of}} steam to her engines and part of that steam was diverted to the pumps needed to stay ahead of the flooding below decks caused by the fractured after cabin. Without full steam, Drakes Captain J. W. Nicholson, could not keep her from hanging up in the sea trough in gale force winds even though he ordered the crew to break up her cabins to feed a wood fire that burned hotter than a coal fire.|$|E
25|$|Steam {{locomotives}} are locomotives with a {{steam engine}} that provides adhesion. Coal, petroleum, or wood is burned in a firebox, boiling {{water in the}} boiler to create pressurized steam. The steam travels through the smokebox before leaving via the chimney or <b>smoke</b> <b>stack.</b> In the process, it powers a piston that transmits power directly through a connecting rod (US: main rod) and a crankpin (US: wristpin) on the driving wheel (US main driver) or to a crank on a driving axle. Steam locomotives have been phased out {{in most parts of}} the world for economical and safety reasons, although many are preserved in working order by heritage railways.|$|E
25|$|Many {{roads and}} bridges {{collapsed}} or had deep cracks, and clean-up crews had to work for days to remove debris from the countless landslides. Many landmarks on the island were greatly affected. The Kalahikiola Congregational Church in Kohala was destroyed due {{to the collapse of}} the church's stone walls; the Hawi <b>smoke</b> <b>stack,</b> a relic of the old sugarcane trade, completely collapsed as well. The Hulihee Palace in Kailua Kona suffered extensive structural damage. Another popular tourist area, Kealakekua Bay, home of the white monument to Captain James Cook, was swept over by massive landslides that caused the entire bay and its surrounding areas to momentarily disappear in a thick cloud of brown dust.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship had}} three <b>smoke</b> <b>stacks</b> {{amidships}} for its boilers, but the forward stack was non-functioning; only added for aesthetic purposes. The ship began service with the Hudson River Day Line as their flagship steamer from 1913 to 1926.|$|R

25|$|Many coal-firing power {{stations}} use flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) to remove sulfur-containing gases from their stack gases. For a typical coal-fired power station, FGD will remove 95% {{or more of}} the SO2 in the flue gases. An example of FGD is the wet scrubber which is commonly used. A wet scrubber is basically a reaction tower equipped with a fan that extracts hot <b>smoke</b> <b>stack</b> gases from a power plant into the tower. Lime or limestone in slurry form is also injected into the tower to mix with the stack gases and combine with the sulfur dioxide present. The calcium carbonate of the limestone produces pH-neutral calcium sulfate that is physically removed from the scrubber. That is, the scrubber turns sulfur pollution into industrial sulfates.|$|E
25|$|At one point, the Dixmont campus {{contained}} over 80 structures. However, in {{an effort}} to modernize the hospital, many of the unused and obsolete buildings were demolished in 1967. These included the Men's Annex (which housed many of the patients who were trusted with work details in the further reaches of the property), greenhouses, stables, barns, garages, and many cottages. To the left of Reed Hall stood the maintenance building which housed the carpenters', electrical, and machinist shops, as well as a basketball and shuffleboard court on the upper level. The four-story Industrial Arts building (sometimes referred to as the Garment Building) was built in 1933 and allowed patients to manufacture textiles, shoes, and furniture. Behind the Hutchinson building was the Rosenzweig House, an old white house that originally was home to the hospital's superintendents, but was later used as the security office. Near the service entrance on Ohio River Boulevard was the boiler building, reservoir/water treatment building, coal storage building, laundry building, and the iconic <b>smoke</b> <b>stack.</b> A sewage treatment plant was located adjacent to Tom's Run and still remains today.|$|E
500|$|Originally the {{locomotive}} had a [...] "diamond" [...] <b>smoke</b> <b>stack.</b> It is unknown {{when that was}} changed to a straight [...] "shotgun" [...] stack. Sometime during the early 20th century {{the locomotive}} was converted from coal burning to oil burning and its wooden [...] "cowcatcher" [...] pilot was replaced with a steel pipe pilot. [...] The wooden cab was replaced with an all-steel cab, and its kerosene [...] "box" [...] headlamp was replaced with an electric one. [...] When the engine was relocated from Louisiana to Vermont its steel cab roof was removed {{in preparation for the}} ride on a flat car. [...] The roof was later mistaken for scrap metal as a worker at Steamtown cut out a piece for use as a stack cover for the locomotive. [...] In 1970 the train underwent what the Steamtown Historical Study refers to as a [...] "misguided" [...] restoration, and given a diamond-shaped <b>smoke</b> <b>stack</b> and a kerosene [...] "box" [...] headlamp, both of which bearing very little resemblance to the stack and headlamp originally worn by the engine. [...] The restoration thus gave the engine an appearance unlike any form it had assumed during its service life.|$|E

50|$|On 30 December, a Japanese {{aircraft}} {{dropped a}} bomb that landed about 50 ft {{short of the}} ship, skipped above and over the ship between her <b>smoke</b> <b>stacks,</b> and fell into the water {{on the other side}} of the ship.|$|R
500|$|The {{government}} also made drastic cuts to {{scientific research and}} data collection. [...] Over 2,000 scientists were dismissed and funding was cut from world renowned research facilities. [...] Drastic cuts were also made to many essential programs, some so deep {{that they had to}} shut down entirely, including the monitoring of <b>smoke</b> <b>stack</b> emissions, food inspections, oil spills, water quality, and climate change. [...] During this time, the long form census was also discontinued as a mandatory part of the census. [...] This was ostensibly due to privacy concerns, however, the number of complaints about privacy proved to be minimal.|$|E
500|$|On 12 September 1942 U-156 was patrolling off {{the coast}} of West Africa midway between Liberia and Ascension Island roughly [...] south of Cape Palmas. At 11:37 the aft port lookout sighted a <b>smoke</b> <b>stack</b> at 230 degrees. Hartenstein {{followed}} the target, which was zigzagging at , until {{the general direction of the}} large ocean liner became evident. U-156 was running at [...] into a favourable attack position, and Hartenstein ordered the attack at 21:07. He slowed speed at 22:00 and ordered surfaced deflection shots from torpedo tubes I and III. After three minutes and six seconds the first torpedo detonated, then the second. He had hoped to capture the ship's senior officers, but to his surprise, Hartenstein saw over two thousand people struggling in the water. Hartenstein immediately began rescue operations. Laconia sank at 23:23.|$|E
500|$|In 1903, Hela {{was taken}} into the dry dock at the Kaiserliche Werft Danzig for {{extensive}} modernization. The ship's superstructure was rebuilt, and her two rear 8.8cm guns were removed. Her boilers, which had been trunked into a single <b>smoke</b> <b>stack</b> were now split between two funnels. Coal storage capacity was also increased, from [...] to [...] The ship was also further subdivided; the 22 watertight compartments above the armored deck were increased to 30, and the double bottom was extended to cover 39percent of the hull. She was also re-boilered; her six original boilers were replaced with eight Marine-type boilers. Work lasted until 1906, at which point she rejoined the fleet and was stationed in Germany. Her crew was also increased {{by the addition of}} another officer and 16 enlisted men. After 1910, Hela was withdrawn from active service and used as a fleet tender.|$|E
50|$|The town of Dawson is now largely gone, {{with only}} a few {{buildings}} remaining. The tall <b>smoke</b> <b>stacks</b> of the coking ovens were eventually demolished in the early 2000s because they represented a liability to the current owner of the property.|$|R

500|$|At 12:23, {{the bombers}} {{broke out of}} a squall line, and Cousland in No. 81 {{immediately}} sighted the Rex. [...] "There it is! There it is!" [...] he transmitted by radio to the other pilots, [...] "81 to 80, twelve o'clock." [...] At 12:25, as predicted, the B-17s flew by the Rex while it was [...] east of Sandy Hook. The aircraft reversed course and came up the ship's port side, with No. 82 flying wing on No. 80 [...] "at <b>smoke</b> <b>stack</b> level". From the co-pilot's seat of No. 81, Goddard took a series of photographs with the Graflex. In the waist position of No. 80, Meloy made voice contact by radio with the ship's captain, who invited [...] "all members of the flight {{to come down to}} lunch." [...] The ship's passengers filled its decks, waving to the bombers, with a group of Americans purportedly singing the Star Spangled Banner.|$|E
500|$|Gneisenau {{was ordered}} as Ersatz Hessen as a {{replacement}} for the old pre-dreadnought , under the contract name [...] "E." [...] The Deutsche Werke in Kiel was awarded the contract, where the keel was laid on 6 May 1935. The ship was launched on 8 December 1936, after which fitting-out work was begun. The ship was completed in May 1938 and commissioned for sea trials on the 21st, under the command of Kapitän zur See (KzS) Erich Förste. The trials revealed a dangerous tendency to ship considerable amounts of water in heavy seas. This caused flooding in the bow and damaged electrical systems in the forward gun turret. As a result, {{she went back to the}} dockyard for extensive modification of the bow. The original straight stem was replaced with a raised [...] "Atlantic bow." [...] A diagonal cap was fitted to the <b>smoke</b> <b>stack</b> to keep the main mast free of smoke. The modifications were completed by September 1939, by which time the ship was finally fully operational.|$|E
2500|$|Under {{the command}} of her first Captain, John Borg, she ran the route to Düsseldorf which {{required}} the ship to have a telescopic <b>smoke</b> <b>stack</b> and folding masts. The Captain changed in September 1914 to Captain G. Flygare. [...] After World War I she sailed the Baltic/North Sea routes.|$|E
