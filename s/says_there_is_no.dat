Markinson orders Gabe to infiltrate Rhoemer's stronghold in Ukraine to inject test subjects with a vaccine and locate Phagan, who is now Rhoemer's prisoner. In the catacombs, Phagan tells Gabe that Lian is alive, and they reunite. Lian has become infected with Syphon Filter, and she <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> universal cure.|$|E

Yogesh goes to Devu's house to tell him he wants to marry Vishakha, but Devu calls her and rejects her. He <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> need for Yogesh to marry her; he knows about Jitu's debt, and says he will choose Yogesh's bride himself.|$|E

25|$|Wittgenstein and Hitler {{were born}} just six days apart, though Hitler had to re-sit his {{mathematics}} exam before being allowed into a higher class, while Wittgenstein was moved forward by one, so {{they ended up}} two grades apart at the Realschule. Monk estimates they were both at the school during the 1904–1905 school year, but <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> evidence they {{had anything to do}} with each other. Several commentators have argued that a school photograph of Hitler may show Wittgenstein in the lower left corner, but Hamann says the photograph stems from 1900 or 1901, before Wittgenstein's time.|$|E

500|$|Anne {{shared with}} James {{the fault of}} extravagance, though it took her several years to exhaust her {{considerable}} dowry. She loved dancing and pageants, activities often frowned upon in Presbyterian Scotland, but for which she found a vibrant outlet in Jacobean London, where she created a [...] "rich and hospitable" [...] cultural climate at the royal court, became an enthusiastic playgoer, and sponsored lavish masques. Sir Walter Cope, asked by Robert Cecil to select a play for the Queen during her brother Ulrik of Holstein's visit, wrote, [...] "Burbage is come and <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> new play the Queen has not seen but they have revived an old one called Love's Labour's Lost which for wit and mirth he says will please her exceedingly." [...] Anne's masques, scaling unprecedented heights of dramatic staging and spectacle, were avidly attended by foreign ambassadors and dignitaries and functioned as a potent demonstration of the English crown's European significance. Zorzi Giustinian, the Venetian ambassador, wrote of the Christmas 1604 masque that [...] "in everyone's opinion no other Court could have displayed such pomp and riches".|$|E
500|$|However, {{the text}} is ambiguous, making it {{questionable}} that Henry ever matures. As critic Donald Gibson stated in The Red Badge of Courage: Redefining the Hero, [...] "the novel undercuts itself. It <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> answer to the questions it raises; yet it says the opposite.... It says that Henry Fleming finally sees things as they are; it says he is a deluded fool. It says that Henry does not see things as they are; {{but no one else}} does either." [...] Although Crane critic and biographer Stallman wrote of Henry's [...] "spiritual change" [...] {{by the end of the}} story, he also found this theme difficult to champion in light of the novel's enigmatic ending. Although Henry [...] "progresses upwards toward manhood and moral triumph", as he begins to mature by taking leave of his previous [...] "romantic notions," [...] "the education of the hero ends as it began: in self deception." [...] Critic William B. Dillingham also noted the novel's heroism paradox, especially in terms of the introspective Henry's lapse into unreasoning self-abandon in the second half of the book. Dillingham stated that [...] "in order to be courageous, a man in time of physical strife must abandon the highest of his human facilities, reason and imagination, and act instinctively, even animalistically." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{photographs}} were {{taken of the}} lynching, which were published and sold as postcards in local stores for 25 cents each; also sold were pieces of the rope, Frank's nightshirt, and branches from the tree. According to Elaine Marie Alphin, author of An Unspeakable Crime: The Prosecution and Persecution of Leo Frank, they were selling so fast that the police announced that sellers would require a city license. In the postcards, members of the lynch mob or crowd can be seen posing {{in front of the}} body, one of them holding a portable camera. Historian Amy Louise Wood writes that local newspapers did not publish the photographs because it would have been too controversial, given that the lynch mob can be clearly seen and that the lynching was being condemned around the country. The Columbia State, which opposed the lynching, wrote: [...] "The heroic Marietta lynchers are too modest to give their photographs to the newspapers." [...] Wood also writes that a news film of the lynching that included the photographs was released, although it focused on the crowds without showing Frank's body; its showing was prevented by censorship boards around the U.S., though Wood <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> evidence that it was stopped in Atlanta.|$|E

Dagmar Wodtko argues {{that it is hard to}} identify Lusitanian personal or place-names that are without question not Celtic. Some argue that the p- in PORCOM does not alone mark Lusitanian as not Celtic, and that it could be classed as a Celtic dialect, but one that preserved Indo-European [...] (or possibly an already phonetically weakened , written P as an archaism). This is based largely on numerous apparently Celtic personal, deity, and place names.|$|E
2500|$|In pagan Ireland, three was a {{significant}} number and the Irish had many triple deities, a fact that may have aided Saint Patrick in his evangelisation efforts when he [...] "held up a shamrock and discoursed on the Christian Trinity". Patricia Monaghan <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> evidence that the shamrock was sacred to the pagan Irish. However, Jack Santino speculates {{that it may have}} represented the regenerative powers of nature, and was recast in a Christian context. Icons of St Patrick often depict the saint [...] "with a cross {{in one hand and a}} sprig of shamrocks in the other". Roger Homan writes, [...] "We can perhaps see St Patrick drawing upon the visual concept of the triskele when he uses the shamrock to explain the Trinity".|$|E
2500|$|Historian Henry Reynolds {{says there}} was a {{widespread}} call from settlers during the frontier wars for the [...] "extirpation" [...] or [...] "extermination" [...] of the Aboriginal people. But he has contended that the British government acted {{as a source of}} restraint on settlers' actions. Reynolds <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> evidence the British government deliberately planned the wholesale destruction of indigenous Tasmanians—a November 1830 letter to Arthur by Sir George Murray warned that the extinction of the race would leave [...] "an indelible stain upon the character of the British Government"—and therefore what eventuated does not meet the definition of genocide codified in the 1948 United Nations convention. He says Arthur was determined to defeat the Aboriginal people and take their land, but believes there is little evidence he had aims beyond that objective and wished to destroy the Tasmanian race.|$|E

2500|$|As to the name, a few early White Windsor soup recipes {{included}} {{the use of}} Windsor fava beans (broad beans), perhaps {{the origin of the}} name. Quinion <b>says</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> connection to the royal family itself since Windsor soup predates 1917, when the family changed its name from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor. He also adds that fictional barrister Rumpole of the Bailey mentioned eating it on the Great Western Railway in a book of short stories dated 1978 [...] although Quinion questions whether this is an endorsement of the soup, [...] "the extract confirms that the soup was at one time a staple of the restaurant menus of British Railways." [...] Though Dr Malcolm Timperley, a researcher in the National Railway Museum's library and archives, reports that their team has specifically researched the existence of brown Windsor soup in British dining cars.

2500|$|Weir and Jerman use {{the name}} sheela for the figure {{because it had}} entered popular usage; they also call figures of both sexes [...] "exhibitionist".

An earlier reference to the dubious nature of the name is made by H.C. Lawlor in an article in Man Vol. 31, Jan 1931 (Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland), in which he writes, [...] "The term [...] "sheela-na-gig" [...] has no etymological meaning and is an absurd name."
