[...] "Never on no account lay your craft close alongside; thar's river thieves at these {{landings}} as would empty half the cargo if {{you left the}} boat for ten minutes, if they could step aboard, and these niggers are always asleep the minute after you take your eyes off them. So, whether you have got anything aboard or not, stick to the rule and moor her a bit off the wharf. It's only the trouble of dropping the grapnel over on the outside {{in addition to the}} hawser ashore, and then there's never no trouble when you get back and have to report as how you have lost some of the bales.

60|$|I {{must confess}} {{that there is}} danger of this. To us the danger is very great. It cannot be good for us to send ships laden outside with iron shields instead of inside with <b>soft</b> <b>goods</b> and {{hardware}} to these thickly thronged American ports. It cannot be good {{for us to have}} to throw millions into these harbors instead of taking millions out from them. It cannot be good for us to export thousands upon thousands of soldiers to Canada of whom only hundreds would return. The whole turmoil, cost, and paraphernalia of such a course would be injurious to us in the extreme, and the loss of our commerce would be nearly ruinous. But the injury of such a war to us would be as nothing to the injury which it would inflict upon the States. To them for many years it would be absolutely ruinous. It would entail not only all those losses which such a war must bring with it, but that greater loss which would arise to the nation from the fact of its having been powerless to prevent it. Such a war would prove that it had lost the freedom for which it had struggled, and which for so many years it has enjoyed. For the sake of that people as well as for our own--and for their sakes rather than for our own-- let us, as far as may be, abstain from words which are needlessly injurious. They have done much that is great and noble, ever since this war has begun, and we have been slow to acknowledge it. They have made sacrifices for the sake of their country which we have ridiculed. They have struggled to maintain a good cause, and we have disbelieved in their earnestness. They have been anxious to abide by their Constitution, which to them has been as it were a second gospel, and we have spoken of that Constitution {{as though it had been}} a thing of mere words in which life had never existed. This has been done while their hands are very full and their back heavily laden. Such words coming from us, or from parties among us, cannot justify those threats of war which we hear spoken; but that they should make the hearts of men sore and their thoughts bitter against us, can hardly be matter of surprise.|$|E
60|$|On the Wednesday {{morning they}} left Melbourne by the 6 A.M. train for Albury, which latter place {{they reached the}} same day, about 2 P.M., having then crossed the Murray river, and passed into the colony of New South Wales. Here they stayed but a few hours {{and then went on}} by coach on their journey to Nobble. From one wretched vehicle they were handed on to another, never {{stopping}} anywhere long enough to go to bed,--three hours at one wretched place and five at another,--travelling at the rate of six miles an hour, bumping through the mud and slush of the bush roads, and still going on for three days and three nights. This was roughing it indeed. Even Dick complained, and said that, of all the torments prepared for wicked mortals on earth, this Australian coaching was the worst. They went through Wagga-Wagga and Murrumburra, and other places with similar names, till at last they were told that they had reached Nobble. Nobble they thought was the foulest place which they had ever seen. It was a gold-digging town, as such places are called, and had been built with great rapidity to supply the necessities of adjacent miners. It was constructed altogether of wood, but no two houses had been constructed alike. They generally had gable ends opening on to the street, but were so different in breadth, altitude, and form, that {{it was easy to see}} that each enterprising proprietor had been his own architect. But they were all alike in having enormous advertisement-boards, some high, some broad, some sloping, on which were declared the merits of the tradesmen who administered within to the wants of mining humanity. And they had generally assumed most singular names for themselves: 'The Old Stick-in-the-Mud <b>Soft</b> <b>Goods</b> Store,' 'The Polyeuka Stout Depot,' 'Number Nine Flour Mills,' and so on,--all of which were very unintelligible to our friends till they learned that these were the names belonging to certain gold-mining claims which had been opened in the neighbourhood of Nobble. The street itself was almost more perilous to vehicles than the slush of the forest-tracks, so deep were the holes and so uncertain the surface. When Caldigate informed the driver that they wanted to be taken as far as Henniker's hotel, the man said that he had given up going so far as that for the last two months, the journey being too perilous. So they shouldered their portmanteaus and struggled forth down the street. Here and there a short bit of wooden causeway, perhaps for the length of three houses, would assist them; and then, again, they would have to descend into the roadway and plunge along through the mud.|$|E
30|$|The fashion retail {{industry}} {{has shifted from}} an autonomous, primarily <b>soft</b> <b>good</b> product and service orientation in TCE, to integrated retailing concepts across global venues such as communication, entertainment, and transportation in GCE. The fashion retail marketplace in TCE is shifting from targeted to confluence across multiple segments in GCE. TCE and GCE consumers can shop multi-channels which offer choice among all physical and virtual formats and uni-channel which uses all channels during a single shopping episode in one retail format for a specific purchase. In SCE, consumers obtain what they pursue from an omni-channel environment that is supported by technology. Retail access, which previously was time and space bound, is now boundary free so that shopping with many retailers has become smart-ubiquitous.|$|R
