40|$|Abstract: The {{widespread}} use of test scores for different educational and social decision making purposes has made the washback effect of tests a distinct educational phenomenon (Cheng, 1997). The high school third grade final exam in the general educational system of Iran has for long been a high <b>stake</b> <b>test</b> designed to assess the achievement of high school graduates in different school subjects. The present study aimed to investigate the washback effect of this nation-wide exam on EFL teachers’ teaching methodology, assessment procedures, and attitudes towards {{different aspects of the}} educational system. For this purpose, a researcher made, validated questionnaire was administered to 160 EFL teachers. The results indicated that the third grade nation-wide final exam adversely affects EFL teachers’ teaching methodology and increases teaching to the test effect quite noticeably as they try to teach according to the content and format of the test. The results further showed an even stronger negative effect of the exam on EFL teachers’ assessment procedures. However, the teachers’ attitude towards different aspects of the educational system was not found to be as strongly affected as the other two variables. The findings of the study are of importance for testing and assessment bureaus in charge of extensive high stake tests development. Moreover, raising teachers’ awareness of the drawback of teaching-to-the test effect of such a high <b>stake</b> <b>test</b> might help them improve their teaching and evaluation practices...|$|E

40|$|Abstract High <b>stakes</b> <b>testing</b> is popularly {{examined}} in educational research, but contemporary analyses tend {{to reflect a}} qualitative or quantitative research design (e. g., Au, 2007; Cochran-Smith 2 ̆ 6 Lytle, 2006; Gamble, 2010). Exhaustive debate over the relative {{success or failure of}} high <b>stakes</b> <b>testing</b> is often framed between competing visions of epistemological constructs, and the historical foundations of high <b>stakes</b> <b>testing</b> policies are rarely explored. The origins of high <b>stakes</b> <b>testing</b> can be traced to local school reform efforts in states like Louisiana, and investigating the roots of high <b>stakes</b> <b>testing</b> at the state level contextualizes the national debate on student assessment in research and scholarship. Using historical research methods, this project details the local campaign to implement the Louisiana Educational Assessment Program (LEAP) as Louisiana’s comprehensive high <b>stakes</b> <b>testing</b> program. Enacted under state law in 1986, the LEAP is a series of K- 12 student assessments aligned to prescriptive state standards. The LEAP is among the nation’s longest comprehensive high <b>stakes</b> <b>testing</b> programs and is the centerpiece to Louisiana’s school accountability system. The narrative of its development offers critical insight into the overarching rationales for high <b>stakes</b> <b>testing</b> that continue to drive accountability policies throughout the country. This study interweaves sociological and political history into a singular chronological record of the LEAP. Historical research methodology informs this study by establishing the basis for data collection and analysis. Historical research method is the systematic collection and evaluation of primary source data in order to determine trends, causes, or effects of past events (Gay, 1996; Lucey, 1984). Methods used in this research investigation include document analysis and oral history interviews. Multiple data sources are used to gain a thorough understanding of the historical context surrounding the implementation of the LEAP. The LEAP functions as both a student assessment program and policy of school accountability, and the story of its development is an important narrative within the field of high <b>stakes</b> <b>testing</b> research and scholarship...|$|R

40|$|How {{effective}} are standardized /high <b>stake</b> <b>test</b> at measuring student’s {{academic performance}} and providing individualized outcomes based on the contents of how the test are designed? Standardized testing {{has been a very}} important issue in education today. Many schools use the testing score to determine whether a child should continue to the next grade level. As we review the methods teachers use to prepare students for these types of test, and the amount of instruction time utilized to cover test materials, and the level of emphasis placed on these test the question of students performance as well as academic success is a rising question. It is importance for educational stakeholders to determine if students are learning the necessary materials needed to prepare them to move into the next grade and if the results from the test used accurately measure students individualized success and academic performance. Another issue that sheds light on the importance of this question is how much of this information is retained by students after the test is over from each year...|$|E

[...] Wichita State University, College of Education, Dept. of Counseling, Educational Leadership, Educational and School PsychologyPolicymakers {{from both}} {{political}} parties {{and the general public}} see standardized tests as easily quantifiable measures of school quality and student learning. They assume these high <b>stakes</b> <b>tests</b> will motivate teachers and students to try harder and that the results will be used systematically to benefit all students. Since schools operate with a finite amount of resources, any time or money they dedicate to passing the test is time and money they cannot spend on educating all students. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate how the new high <b>stakes</b> <b>testing</b> environment and the new state assessments have influenced elementary teachers' approach to preparing students for standardized tests. Campbell's law was used to examine whether the utilization of educational and instructional triage was an inevitable result of high <b>stakes</b> <b>testing.</b> Study participants included nineteen experienced third through fifth grade teachers in a suburban district in a small, Midwestern town. The research indicated that education and instructional triage was occurring, although there was more instructional triage then educational. Teachers are resigned to high <b>stakes</b> <b>testing,</b> therefore assessments drive their instruction, and they define student success by their score on the <b>test.</b> High <b>stakes</b> <b>testing</b> has led to increased accountability and data driven instruction, however low <b>stakes</b> <b>testing</b> also creates these benefits without the undue pressure.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{efficacy}} of high <b>stakes</b> <b>testing</b> as a school reform policy by determining the impact that high <b>stakes</b> <b>testing</b> pressure has on academic achievement. High <b>stakes</b> <b>testing</b> pressure was operationalized by the High <b>Stakes</b> <b>Testing</b> Value (HSTV); a value determined by accumulating the number of <b>testing</b> <b>stakes</b> in each state’s accountability policy. Academic achievement was operationalized by reading and mathematics National Assessment of Academic Progress (NAEP) scores. NAEP achievement scores in reading and mathematics served as criterion variables for the multiple regression analyses while the following served as predictor variables; (a) the percentage of students identified as low socio economic status, (b) the percentage of students identified as English language learners, (c) the expenditures per student adjusted by the comparable wage index (CWI), and the HSTV. The statistical data produced to address the six null hypotheses guiding this study showed that a lack of correlation existed between the HSTV variable and NAEP scores; therefore, all six null hypotheses were retained.

30|$|We {{examined}} {{the ability of}} chemically modified tannin and tannin-copper complexes to penetrate wood {{and the ability of}} the treated wood to resist termites. Only the tannin-treated wood retained the agents after treatment. Wood with untreated mimosa tannin (MT) retained the least amount, followed by wood with resorcinolated tannin (RMT) and that with catecholated tannin (CMT). When RMT or CMT was mixed with ammonia-copper, the wood retained twice as much of these solutions as the MT -ammonia-copper solution. The degree of retention of RMT-NH 3 -Cu and CMT-NH 3 -Cu ranged from 268 to 326 kg/m 3. The solutions penetrated 2 – 13 mm from the tangential sections of the logs. We also measured the termite resistance conferred by these solutions. Most of the tannin-NH 3 -Cu solutions showed contact lethality for termites in the contact toxicity test. However, the termites were fed cellulose treated with those solutions and most survived the oral toxicity test (14 days). Moreover, these solutions reduced the amount of damage to the wood by termites. However, the mortality rate of the termites during the eating-damage test (> 21 days) did not reach 100 % for any of the solutions except for RMT. As a result of the field <b>stake</b> <b>test</b> with the same log's used for the penetrability test, the mass loss of wood treated with RMT or CMT alone or with RMT + NH 3 + CuCl 2, was about one-third to one-half that of the controls. Because these solutions have good wood penetrability and good termite resistance, they have potential use as low-toxicity wood preservatives.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{focuses on}} which {{competence}} aims {{that are actually}} measured in the written exam in English in Norwegian upper secondary schools and, further, on students' understanding of the texts and the tasks in the exam sets. English is a mandatory subject for first year students in the general studies programmes in the upper secondary schools. In the vocational study programmes the subject is compulsory as well, but it spans over two years, and students {{sit for the exam}} {{at the end of their}} second year. The written examination is prepared, and graded centrally by the Norwegian Directorate of Education. The study is based on the analysis of six exams sets from spring 2010 to fall 2013. As well as looking at which competence aims that are tested, the study further aims to investigate to what extent the students understand the texts and tasks that are given, so that they are able to show a broad spectrum of their competence. In addition, surveys and interviews with students from both general and vocational study programs (building and construction) have been carried out. As this exam is considered a high <b>stake</b> <b>test</b> it is important that the validity and reliability are high. This is also investigated. The analysis of the exam sets showed a considerable difference in which, and how many, competence aims were tested in each set. Consequently, students who sit for the same examination are not measured in the same competence aims. What is measured, further depends on the tasks the student chooses, the content of the text they write and whether or not they are aware of what they should write about in order to show a broad spectrum of their competence. The findings also show the vocational students were not very motivated to read the texts in the preparation booklet. The majority found the texts difficult, tedious and not at all related to their field of study. Students from general studies were more positive to the text booklet and saw the benefits of it. Regarding the prompts, the vocational students were generally better at choosing the writing tasks that suited their study programme and the tasks in which they were able to show their competence the best. The study concludes that the ENG 1002 / 1003 exam does not measure a broad spectrum of competences. The competence aims are complex and difficult to measure, the texts in the preparation booklet are not interesting and useful for all students and the prompts are unclear. Consequently, this makes the exam, in its present form, invalid and unreliable...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} four {{aspects of}} current high <b>stakes</b> <b>testing</b> that impact minority students and others traditionally underserved by American education. Data from research conducted at Boston College over 30 years highlight 4 issues: high <b>stakes,</b> high standards <b>tests</b> {{do not have}} a markedly positive effect on teaching and learning; high <b>stakes</b> <b>tests</b> do not motivate the unmotivated; authentic high stakes assessments are not a more equitable way to assess the progress of students who differ in race, culture, native language, or gender; and high <b>stakes</b> <b>testing</b> programs have been shown to increase high school dropout rates, particularly among minority populations. The paper emphasizes the need to carefully monitor the four issues. Though raising educational standards and improving educational quality in American schools is important, efforts to foster academic achievement must involve more than simply setting demanding standards and mandating examinations that are referenced to them.

High <b>stakes</b> <b>testing,</b> the singular mode of accountability under NCLB, now affects all students in the American Public School system. Despite the fact that the issue involves the distribution of billions of dollars to public schools, the voices of teachers in these schools are proportionately left out of debates on accountability.

This study focuses on the educators in Texas who teach in the Public School system, under NCLB, and have participated in the NWP. The barrage of state and federal testing each year in Texas provides a backdrop of a high­stakes testing environment in which teachers and students must work and learn.

The article outlines the policy context for high stakes examinations, {{as well as the}} ideas of testing and accountability as major tenets of current education reform and policy. In partial explanation of the widespread acceptance and use of standardized tests in the United States, we argue that there is a pervasive testing culture, in addition to other contributing factors such as administrative utility, profit motives, and political ideology. Finally, we offer a critique of high <b>stakes</b> <b>testing</b> reforms in light of concerns about equality of educational opportunity...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{pervasive}} and insidious problems facing assessment practitioners and measurement experts involves arriving at appropriate interpretations concerning student performances in low <b>stakes</b> <b>testing</b> conditions. If the observed performances of students appear quite high, we may conclude that our students have achieved our learning objectives an...|$|R
40|$|Interviews with 61 {{teachers}} and administrators in four Minnesota school districts suggest that, in their judgment, Minnesota's state-mandated tests were well-aligned with curricular priorities and teachers' instructional goals, emphasizing critical thinking as well as competencies needed to pass the Basic Standards exit exam, and avoiding the type of recall item that would require drill and memorization. This result, i n combination with a survey showing that 85 percent of Minnesota teachers support the exit exam, suggests that Minnesota has been unusually successful in designing a high <b>stakes</b> <b>testing</b> system that has garnered teacher support. The success of Minnesota's model suggests that unintended narrowing of the curriculum due to high <b>stakes</b> <b>testing</b> may be avoided if pressure on teachers to narrow the curriculum is reduced through well-designed, well-aligned exams...|$|R
40|$|In Australia, {{traditionally}} a {{wide range}} of measures have been used to identify academically successful schools. The mix of these measures has varied from state to state. But recently, added to this mix, and perhaps becoming the most influential factor, has been the examination results of senior students. These have become far more available to the prospective parents and governing bodies. They are used to gauge the ranking of the school, and to whether parents can expect their children to gain entry into the more prestigious tertiary programs available. But these scores are also being used to rank staff, and in turn, the 2 ̆ 7 quality 2 ̆ 7 of staff becomes yet another factor in identifying an academically successful school. In other words, the notion of high <b>stakes</b> <b>testing</b> is gaining wide spread use across all forms of schooling in Australia, including State, Independent and Catholic schools. This thesis is about teachers in academically successful Christian Brothers 2 ̆ 7 schools. It is an interpretive study that seeks to understand how these teachers respond to this form of assessment: high <b>stakes</b> <b>testing.</b> Their responses include emotional responses, how they change their teaching style and how they feel about teaching in Christian Brothers 2 ̆ 7 schools striving for academic success. In this research I interviewed teachers and administrators at three academically successful Christian Brothers 2 ̆ 7 schools in three different states in Australia. I developed three cases from these interviews and document searches, one drawn from each school, that indicate the range of issues that emerged, for them, as teachers in academically successful Christian Brothers 2 ̆ 7 schools. The specific use of high <b>stakes</b> <b>testing</b> was found to be very different in each of the schools. One school used high <b>stakes</b> <b>testing</b> as an accountability measure for staff, another used it as an accountability measure for students, and the third had no history of using high stakes testing.;The study concludes that academic excellence can be achieved in Christian Brothers 2 ̆ 7 schools whilst remaining faithful to the ethos that underpins these schools: the Charism of Edmund Rice. Significant factors in the determination of the successful implementation of high <b>stakes</b> <b>testing</b> in these schools were found to be: the effect of senior management; influence of the media; the influence of culture; and changing culture {{and the nature of the}} schools. The thesis concludes with a blueprint for a hypothetical Christian Brothers 2 ̆ 7 school to follow that may lead to academic success...|$|R
40|$|An {{external}} change agent (ECA) {{was recently}} employed in three Queensland schools to align {{the school curriculum}} {{with the requirements of}} the state’s high <b>stakes</b> <b>test</b> known as the Queensland Core Skills test (QCS). This paper reports on the teachers’ perceptions of a change process led by an ECA. With the ever-increasing implementation of high <b>stakes</b> <b>testing</b> in Australian schools, teachers are under mounting pressure to produce ‘results’. Therefore, in order to maximise their students’ success in these tests, schools are altering their curricula to incorporate the test requirements. Rather than the traditional method of managing such curriculum change processes internally, there is a growing trend for principals to source external expertise in the form of ECAs. Although some academics, teachers, and much of the relevant literature, would regard such a practice as problematic, this study found that in fact, teachers were quite open to externally led curriculum change, especially if they perceived the leader to be knowledgeable and creditable in this area...|$|R
40|$|IDENTIFIERS *Teaching to the Test High <b>stakes</b> <b>testing</b> is a {{given in}} many public {{school districts in the}} United States. This paper reports the {{chilling}} effect high <b>stakes</b> <b>testing</b> had on the pedagogy of one teacher. The study took place in a large Midwestern urban district where a university consultant observed a fifth-grade classroom. This researcher was able to observe and document a teacher who attempted to engage in purposeful change in her teaching style and classroom structure. The instructor decided to teach a unit on the Age of Exploration, a long-term inquiry project about explorers. She divided the class into six groups of five and sat them at individual tables. She started the project by covering her curriculum in a traditional manner, but once she determined what the students knew about explorers, she instructed the students to choose one question, either one of their own or one from another group, and do research and discover the answer. The students were then aske...|$|R
