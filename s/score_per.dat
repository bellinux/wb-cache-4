25|$|If a batsman {{has been}} {{dismissed}} {{in every single}} innings, then their total number of runs scored divided {{by the number of}} times they have been out gives exactly the average number of runs they <b>score</b> <b>per</b> innings. However, for a batsman with innings which have finished not out, this statistic is only an estimate of the average number of runs they <b>score</b> <b>per</b> innings – the true average number of runs they <b>score</b> <b>per</b> innings is unknown as it is not known how many runs they would have scored if they could have completed all their not out innings. If their scores have a geometric distribution then total number of runs scored divided by the number of times out is the maximum likelihood estimate of their true unknown average.|$|E
25|$|In cricket, a player's {{batting average}} {{is the total}} number of runs they have scored divided by the number of times they have been out. Since the number of runs a player scores and how often they get out are {{primarily}} measures of their own playing ability, and largely independent of their teammates, batting average is a good metric for an individual player's skill as a batsman. The number is also simple to interpret intuitively. If all the batsman's innings were completed (i.e. they were out every innings), this is the average number of runs they <b>score</b> <b>per</b> innings. If they did not complete all their innings (i.e. some innings they finished not out), this number is an estimate of the unknown average number of runs they <b>score</b> <b>per</b> innings. Batting average has been used to gauge cricket players' relative skills since the 18th century.|$|E

25|$|Water quality remains good {{through the}} length of the river. Figures for the final section before it joins the River Idle show that the levels of ammonia and {{dissolved}} oxygen are those which would be expected in a natural ecosystem. Between 1991 and 2006, the BOD has been reduced by more than 50 percent, but there is still room for improvement. Levels of phosphates and nitrates, which are affected by agricultural activity, are quite high, but some improvements have occurred. Water quality is also measured by two biological indexes. These are NTAXA, which relates to the total number of invertebrate species found in samples of the water, and ASPT, (the Average <b>Score</b> <b>Per</b> Taxon), calculated from the numbers of specific invertebrates which are graded according to their sensitivity to organic pollution. The assessment for the years 2004 to 2006 rated the final section as grade A (very good) on the first index, and grade B (good) on the second. This indicates that the water is not far short from unpolluted.|$|E

6000|$|It {{should appear}} that {{a part of}} his trouble arose from his having coquetted also with a certain Mrs. Ruth, about whom he was [...] "dealt with by Mrs Amee, Mr Phillips & 2 more of the Church, our Elder being one. When Mr Phillips with much {{violence}} & sharpnes charged mee home ... that I should hinder the mayd of a match at London, which was not so, could not thinke of any kindnes I euer did her, though shee haue had above 300li. through my fingers, so as if God uphold me not after an especiall manner, it will sinke me surely ... hee told me he would not stop my intended marriage, but assured mee it would not bee good ... all which makes mee reflect upon my rash proceedings with Mrs Sh." [...] Panurge's doubts and difficulties about matrimony were not more entertainingly contradictory. Of course, Peter ends by marrying the widow, and presently we have a comment on [...] "her trim." [...] In January, 1639, he writes to Winthrop: [...] "My wife is very thankfull for her apples, & desires much the new fashioned shooes." [...] Eight years later we find him writing from England, where he had been two years: [...] "I am coming over if I must; my wife comes of necessity to New England, having run her selfe out of breath here"; and then in the postscript, [...] "bee sure you never let my wife come away from thence without my leave, & then you love mee." [...] But life is never pure comedy, and the end in this case is tragical. Roger Williams, after his return from England in 1654, writes to John Winthrop, Jr.: [...] "Your brother flourisheth in good esteeme & is eminent for maintaining the Freedome of the Conscience as to matters of Beliefe, Religion, & Worship. Your Father Peters preacheth the same Doctrine though not so zealously as some years since, yet cries out against New English Rigidities & Persecutions, their civil injuries & wrongs to himselfe, & their unchristian dealing with him in excommunicating his distracted wife. All this he tould me in his lodgings at Whitehall, those lodgings which I was tould were Canterburies [the Archbishop], but he himselfe tould me that that Library wherein we were together was Canterburies & given him by the Parliament. His wife lives from him, not wholy but much distracted. He tells me he had but 200 a yeare & he allowed her 4 <b>score</b> <b>per</b> annum of it. Surely, Sir, the most holy Lord is most wise in all the trialls he exerciseth his people with. He tould me that his affliction from his wife stird him up to Action abroad, & when successe tempted him to Pride, the Bitternes in his bozome-comforts was a Cooler & a Bridle to him." [...] Truly the whirligig of time brings about strange revenges. Peter had been driven from England by the persecutions of Laud; a few years later he [...] "stood armed on the scaffold" [...] when that prelate was beheaded, and now we find him installed in the archiepiscopal lodgings. Dr. Palfrey, it appears to me, gives altogether too favorable an opinion both of Peter's character and abilities. I conceive him to have been a vain and selfish man. He may have had the bravery of passionate impulse, but he wanted that steady courage of character which has such a beautiful constancy in Winthrop. He always professed a longing to come back to New England, but it was only a way he had of talking. That he never meant to come is plain from these letters. Nay, when things looked prosperous in England, he writes to the younger Winthrop: [...] "My counsell is you should come hither with your family for certaynly you will bee capable of a comfortable living in this free Commonwealth. I doo seriously advise it.... G. Downing is worth 500l. per annum but 4l. per diem--your brother Stephen worth 2000l. & a maior. I pray come." [...] But when he is snugly ensconced in Whitehall, and may be presumed to have some influence with the prevailing powers, his zeal cools. [...] "I wish you & all friends to stay there & rather looke to the West Indyes if they remoue, for many are here to seeke when they come ouer." [...] To me Peter's highest promotion seems to have been that he walked with John Milton at the Protector's funeral. He was, I suspect, one of those men, to borrow a charitable phrase of Roger Williams, who [...] "feared God in the main," [...] that is, whenever it was not personally inconvenient. William Coddington saw him in his glory in 1651: [...] "Soe wee toucke the tyme to goe to viset Mr Petters at his chamber. I was mery with him & called him the Arch Bp: of Canterberye, in regard to his adtendance by ministers & gentlemen, & it passed very well." [...] Considering certain charges brought against Peter, (though he is said, when under sentence of death, to have denied the truth of them,) Coddington's statement that he liked to have [...] "gentlewomen waite of him" [...] in his lodgings has not a pleasant look. One last report of him we get (September, 1659) in a letter of John Davenport,--"that Mr Hugh Peters is distracted & under sore horrors of conscience, crying out of himselfe as damned & confessing haynous actings." ...|$|E
