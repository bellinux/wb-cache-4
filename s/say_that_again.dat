2500|$|Her fourth album, Ah W Noss, was {{released}} on April 14, 2004, {{and it was also}} an important marking point in Ajram's career. The tremendous success that Ah W Noss achieved, stabilized Ajram's position as an A-List star in the Arab music industry. In late April, Ajram opened for Enrique Iglesias's first concert in Egypt in 2004. Ajram then filmed [...] "Lawn Ouyounak" [...] (Color of Your Eyes), which portrayed Ajram as a bride in a traditional Lebanese wedding. After the release of the album, Ajram Ajram signed-up with Coca-Cola to be their official celebrity spokesperson for the Levant, Arabia and North Africa regions. Her first Coke commercial featured her hit, [...] "Oul Tani Keda?" [...] (<b>Say</b> <b>That</b> <b>Again?),</b> which was filmed with the international Italian director Luca Tomassini. The commercial's success led to it being filmed as a music video behind the scenes of the commercial. The 4th hit single from the album, [...] "Inta Eyh?" [...] (What Are You?), was a slow composed by Samir Sfeir. Nadine Labaki directed another clip that featured Ajram as a wife who sees her husband cheating on her yet she hides it in torment to save their relationship. The music video received tremendous positive reviews and Ajram was greatly praised. Leading Egyptian actors and directors, like Faten Hamama praised Ajram's acting abilities and movie offers doubled for Ajram.|$|E

In 2015, it released an editorial <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> <b>again,</b> despite some problems, privatisation has delivered many improvements. The editorial said that although privatisation 20 years ago was an ideological move, to renationalise the railways {{at a time when they}} are quickly growing would also be motivated by ideology.|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} observation {{must surely}} be "well-known", {{but it seems}} worth giving a simple and quite explicit proof. Take any finite subset X of Rn, n> 1. Then, there is a polynomial function P:Rn -> R which has local minima on the set X, and has no other critical points. Applied to the negative gradient flow of P, this implies {{that there is a}} polynomial vector field with asymptotically stable equilibria on X and no other equilibria. Some trajectories of this vector field are not pre-compact; a complementary observation <b>says</b> <b>that,</b> <b>again</b> for arbitrary X, one can find a vector field with asymptotically stable equilibria on X, no other equilibria except saddles, and all omega-limit sets consisting of singletons...|$|R
