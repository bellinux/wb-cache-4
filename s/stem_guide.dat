40|$|Diagnosis {{and therapy}} of cancer {{remain to be}} the {{greatest}} challenges for all physicians working in clinical oncology and molecular medicine. The grim statistics speak for themselves with reports of 1, 638, 910 men and women diagnosed with cancer and nearly 577, 190 patients passed away due to cancer in the USA in 2012. For practicing clinicians, who treat patients suffering from advanced cancers with contemporary systemic therapies, the main challenge is to attain therapeutic efficacy, while minimizing side effects. Unfortunately, all contemporary systemic therapies cause side effects. In treated patients, these side effects may range from nausea to damaged tissues. In cancer survivors, the iatrogenic outcomes of systemic therapies may include genomic mutations and their consequences. Therefore, there is an urgent need for personalized and targeted therapies. Recently, we reviewed the current status of suicide gene therapy for cancer. Herein, we discuss the novel strategy: genetically engineered <b>stem</b> <b>guided</b> gene therapy. <b>Stem</b> cells have the unique potential for self-renewal and differentiation. This potential is the primary reason for introducing them into medicine to regenerate injured or degenerated organs, as well as to rejuvenate aging tissues. Recent advances in genetic engineering and stem cell research have created the foundations for genetic engineering of stem cells as the vectors for delivery of therapeutic transgenes. Specifically in oncology, the stem cells are genetically engineered to deliver the cell suicide inducing genes selectively to the cancer cells. Expression of the transgenes kills the cancer cells, while leaving healthy cells unaffected. Herein, we present various strategies to bioengineer suicide inducing genes and stem cell vectors. Moreover, we review results of the main preclinical studies and clinical trials. However, the main risk for therapeutic use of stem cells is their cancerous transformation. Therefore, we discuss various strategies to safeguard <b>stem</b> cell <b>guided</b> gene therapy against iatrogenic cancerogenesis. Defining cancer biomarkers to facilitate early diagnosis, elucidating cancer genomics and proteomics with modern tools of next generation sequencing, and analyzing patients’ gene expression profiles provide essential data to elucidate molecular dynamics of cancer and to consider them for crafting pharmacogenomics-based personalized therapies. Streamlining of these data into genetic engineering of stem cells facilitates their use as the vectors delivering therapeutic genes into specific cancer cells. In this realm, <b>stem</b> cells <b>guided</b> gene therapy becomes a promising new frontier in personalized and targeted therapy of cancer...|$|R

It aims at {{the development of}} an inspection system for quality assurance in the automotive industry. The objects to inspect are cylinder heads. In particular the valve seats and the valve <b>stem</b> <b>guides</b> are of special interest. The latter lie in the inner part of the cylinder head and are therefore difficult to access. The different kinds of geometry in combination with other goals, such as inline capability and flexibility regarding measurable object variants, impose the need {{for a new generation of}} optical measurement techniques. Tactile methods are not applicable, particularly because of their slow operating speed. A boost of flexibility is achieved by integrating a robot into the system in order to position the multi-sensor in an optimum configuration to the object for inspection. This additional capability is further exploited by integrating a single camera into the system which is used for detecting the cylinder head’s pose. Thus there is virtually no need for a predefined object position. Next to a general description of the project, we focus on the calibration of the system. Due to the various kinds of involved sub-systems, the overall calibration will be performed in separate steps yielding a network of transformations.

An investigation on opinions and suggestions from teachers and students who have used a trial version of the book was undertaken. Three teachers and a total of 124 students from Grade 7 to Grade 9 participated. Data were collected through interviews, questionnaires and classroom observations.

To investigate several related questions, multivariate analyses were conducted on panel survey data from UR students in a strong pipeline program with multiple program components and UR students in other pipeline interventions with fewer formal program components. With respect to the Research Aim 1, factor analyses clearly supported {{the reliability and validity}} of both formal and informal organizational support scales. This NIH-NIGMS supported study revealed that UR students in a nationally recognized Summer Research Opportunity Program designed with multiple components had higher scores on the strong formal organizational support scale items. Moreover, UR students with higher formal organizational support also had significantly higher informal support from program peers than from either faculty mentors or program staff sources. Overall, findings on Research Aim 2 were less clear as STEM major emerged as the strongest predictor of STEM research career plans. However, there were: (1) a clear relationship between strong formal organizational support and program satisfaction, and (2) a significant but modest relationship between program satisfaction and STEM research career plans.

Prior to the advent of leaded gasolines, poppet-valve engines typically required grinding of the valves and valve seats after 20,000 to 30,000 miles (32,000 to 48,000 km) of service. Sleeve valves did not suffer from the wear and recession caused by the repetitive impact of the poppet valve against its seat. Sleeve valves were also subjected to less intense heat build-up than poppet valves, owing to their greater area of contact with other metal surfaces. In the Knight engine, carbon build-up actually helped to improve the sealing of the sleeves, the engines being said to [...] "improve with use", in contrast to poppet valve engines, which lose compression and power as valves, valve <b>stems</b> and <b>guides</b> wear.

Many elements of the regulatory system that controls this process are known, but the requirement for multiple, functionally distinct transcription factors needs clarification in terms of gene network architecture. Here, we compare {{the features of the}} T-cell specification system with the rule sets underlying two other influential types of gene network models: first, the combinatorial, hierarchical regulatory systems that generate the orderly, synchronized increases in complexity in most invertebrate embryos; second, the dueling ‘master regulator’ systems that are commonly used to explain bistability in microbial systems and in many fate choices in terminal differentiation. The T-cell specification process shares certain features with each of these prevalent models but differs from both of them in central respects. The T-cell system is highly combinatorial but also highly dose-sensitive in its use of crucial regulatory factors. The roles of these factors are not always T-lineage-specific, but they balance and modulate each other's activities long before any mutually exclusive silencing occurs. T-cell specification may provide a new hybrid model for gene networks in vertebrate developmental systems...|$|R

The dimerization initiation site (DIS) {{has been identified as}} a primary sequence that can form a stem-loop structure with a self-complementary sequence in the loop and a bulge in the stem. It has been reported that HIV- 1 RNA fragments containing the DIS form two types of dimers, loose dimers and tight dimers. The loose dimers are spontaneously generated at the physiological temperature and converted into tight dimers by the addition of nucleocapsid protein NCp 7. To know the biochemical process in this two-step dimerization reaction, we chemically synthesized a 39 -mer RNA covering the entire DIS sequence and also a 23 -mer RNA covering the self-complementary loop and its flanking stem within the DIS. Electrophoretic dimerization assays demonstrated that the 39 -mer RNA reproduced the two-step dimerization process, whereas the 23 -mer RNA immediately formed the tight dimer. Furthermore, deletion of the bulge from the 39 -mer RNA prevented the NCp 7 -assisted tight-dimer formation. Therefore, the whole DIS sequence is necessary and sufficient for the two-step dimerization.
