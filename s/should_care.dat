25|$|Colonies of Polybia sericea are polygynous, and {{generally}} {{have more than}} one queen. Typically, the number of queens in a colony is three or four. This results in a lower degree of relatedness among workers, and it has been questioned why workers <b>should</b> <b>care</b> for offspring that are related to them by less than half. Although this is not fully understood, {{it has been suggested that}} the advantages of group living compensate for the low degree of relatedness among workers, so workers will still care for offspring.|$|E
25|$|The Mohist {{philosophers}} {{believed that}} the purpose of life was universal, impartial love. Mohism promoted a philosophy of impartial caring - a person <b>should</b> <b>care</b> equally for all other individuals, regardless of their actual relationship to him or her. The expression of this indiscriminate caring is what makes man a righteous being in Mohist thought. This advocacy of impartiality was a target of attack by the other Chinese philosophical schools, most notably the Confucians who believed that while love should be unconditional, it should not be indiscriminate. For example, children should hold a greater love for their parents than for random strangers.|$|E

The other known literature figure who hand penned the happenings of the era is a young poet and script writer, Poseidon Tsautsau who wrote his poem:The Uncaring father, who <b>should</b> <b>care.</b> In his poem it seems like Tsautsau is blasting Mugabe the Zimbabwean father for not caring for his children, by 'cleaning the mess through adding trash' as he writes in his piece.|$|E
25|$|During spring 2012, Jobbik {{representative}} in Hungarian parliament Zsolt Baráth caused an outrage by commemorating 1882 blood libel against the Jews in Parliament. The Tiszaeszlár blood libel, found later to be unrelated to Jews, {{was known as}} first major anti-Jewish event in modern Hungary, predating the Holocaust. The speech of Baráth caused controversy among Jobbik MPs: some - however finding it inappropriate and uncalled for - stated that in a matured democracy {{there should not be}} taboo topics, while leaders of the Jobbik Parliamentary Group told the media that they had evaluated the speech and learnt the lesson that they <b>should</b> <b>care</b> more about what their MPs are talking. After the incident Baráth was not re-elected and is not an MP of Jobbik anymore.|$|E

In the first Republican presidential debate, {{which took place in}} Cleveland, one question referenced Black Lives Matter. In response to the question, Scott Walker advocated for the proper training of law enforcement and blamed the movement for rising anti-police sentiment, while Marco Rubio was the first candidate to publicly sympathize with the movement's point of view.|$|E

[...] His interest in both the operas and the hotel seemed to fade away." [...] Nevertheless, in 1934 the company made a highly successful eight-month North American tour with Green as its new principal comedian, replacing Henry Lytton. [...] Carte gave approval for, and was closely consulted about, a 1938 film version of The Mikado produced and conducted by Geoffrey Toye, starring Green and released by Universal Pictures, but his only new stage production after 1932 was of The Yeomen of the Guard designed in 1939 by Peter Goffin. The re-staging was regarded as radical, but when Goffin took fright at the storm of controversy, Carte told him, [...] "I don't care what they say about the production. I <b>should</b> <b>care</b> if they said nothing." ...|$|E
500|$|Before Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days was released, 1UP.com {{featured}} Roxas {{at the top}} {{of their}} [...] "Why You <b>Should</b> <b>Care</b> About Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days" [...] feature, calling him [...] "The darling of fanfiction and doujinshi writers everywhere," [...] and commenting on what he does during his only year within Organization XIII. Roxas' role as protagonist was described by G4TV as an attempt to [...] "satiate the ravenous fanboy" [...] due to the explanation from his background. While reviewing 358/2 Days, PALGN's Adam Ghiggino praised Roxas' development saying that even gamers who did not like his character in Kingdom Hearts II would care about him as [...] "he evolves from a self-described 'zombie' to a strong-willed and interesting character". Ghiggino especially noted his relationship with Xion and Axel, which he found charming despite the fact that they repeatedly meet {{at the top of}} a clock tower in many scenes. A similar response appeared in Game Informer, which commented that although such scenes were [...] "dull", Roxas' relation with Xion and Axel was appealing and the game's ending would make up for such moments. GamesRadar also commented that Roxas [...] "starts off like a zombie, but rapidly develops a personality" [...] during the title and joked about the numerous times he eats ice cream. His growth during the game was also picked as one of the most enjoyable elements of the title. IGN agreed, calling Roxas' friendship [...] "heart-aching". On the other hand, 1UP.com mentioned that although Roxas' relationship with Xion and Axel is appealing, some of his first missions feel like [...] "lonely, sad affairs". His maneuvers in the game were praised by GameSpot for being easy to learn despite how complex they look, while IGN liked the variation between them.|$|E

2500|$|George Bush {{was widely}} seen as a [...] "pragmatic caretaker" [...] {{president}} who lacked a unified and compelling long-term theme in his efforts.

Suvorov believed that an effective order should be simple, direct and concise, and that a commander <b>should</b> <b>care</b> deeply about the health and training of his soldiers. [...] Kutuzov also adopted Suvorov's conviction that a commander should lead his troops from the front (instead of from the rear) to provide an example of bravery for the troops to follow. Suvorov also taught Kutuzov the importance of developing close relationships with those under his command. [...] Kutuzov followed this advice to the benefit of his career. This advice contributed to Kutuzov's appointment as Commander-in-Chief in 1812.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{investigator}} Benjamin Radford, most ghost hunting groups including The Atlantic Paranormal Society {{make many}} methodological mistakes.

Anyone can be a ghost investigator, [...] "failing to consider alternative explanations for anomalous ... phenomena", considering emotions and feelings as [...] "evidence of ghostly encounters". [...] "Improper and unscientific investigation methods" [...] for example [...] "using unproven tools and equipment", [...] "sampling errors", [...] "ineffectively using recording devices" [...] and [...] "focusing {{on the history of}} the location...and not the phenomena". In his article for Skeptical Inquirer Magazine Radford concludes that ghost hunters <b>should</b> <b>care</b> about doing a truly scientific investigation [...] "I believe that if ghosts exist, they are important and deserve to be taken seriously.

Montag goes on a rant about Mildred's suicide attempt, Clarisse's disappearance and death, the old woman who burned herself, and the constant din of bombers flying overhead and the imminent threat of war that goes ignored by the masses. He then states that maybe the books of the past have messages that can save society from its own destruction. The conversation is interrupted by a call from Mildred's friend, Mrs. Bowles, and they set up a date to watch the [...] "parlor walls" [...] (large televisions lining the walls of her living room) that night at Mildred's house.|$|E
