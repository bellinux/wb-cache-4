50|$|In modern psychology, vigilance, also termed {{sustained}} concentration, {{is defined}} as the ability to maintain concentrated attention over prolonged periods of time.

The study of vigilance has expanded since the 1940s mainly due to the increased interaction of people with machines for applications involving monitoring and detection of rare events and weak signals.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} examined pigeons' {{response rates}} during short trials <b>signaled</b> by <b>stimuli</b> closely spaced along a wavelength continuum. In Experiment 1 separate {{halves of the}} continuum were correlated with different reinforcement schedules. In Experiment 2, the middle stimulus {{was accompanied by a}} lower probability of reinforcement than were the remaining wavelengths. Both procedures resulted in dimensional contrast “shoulders,” seen as relatively enhanced or depressed response rates in the presence of stimuli between the extreme of the continuum and the border separating the positive and negative stimuli. Sequential analyses addressed possible contributions of the following interactions: (a) local contrast, seen when rate during a given schedule depends on the schedule in the just-preceding trial; (b) modification of local contrast by the similarity of the <b>signaling</b> <b>stimuli</b> (P. Blough, 1983); and (c) schedule-independent rate contrast, seen when rate in a given trial depends on the rate controlled by the stimulus that accompanied the just-preceding trial (Malone & Rowe, 1981). Dimensional contrast functions were similar when isolated according to the schedule, to the similarity of the <b>signaling</b> <b>stimulus,</b> and to the response rate of the just-preceding trial. The interactions noted above do not appear to make important contributions to this effect...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} signals on {{resistance}} to change was evaluated using pigeons responding on a three-component multiple schedule. Each component contained a variable-interval initial link followed by a fixed-time terminal link. One component was an unsignaled-delay schedule, and two were equivalent signaled-delay schedules. After baseline training, {{resistance to change}} was assessed through (a) extinction and (b) adding free food to the intercomponent interval. During these tests, the <b>signal</b> <b>stimulus</b> {{from one of the}} signaled-delay components (SIG-T) was replaced with the initial-link stimulus from that component, converting it to an unsignaled-delay schedule. That <b>signal</b> <b>stimulus</b> was added to the delay period of the unsignaled-delay component (UNS), converting it to a signaled-delay schedule. The remaining signaled component remained unchanged (SIG-C). Resistance-to-change tests showed removing the signal had a minimal effect on resistance to change in the SIG-T component compared to the unchanged SIG-C component except for one block during free-food testing. Adding the signal to the UNS component significantly increased response rates suggesting that component had low response strength. Interestingly, the direction of the effect was in the opposite direction from what is typically observed. Results are consistent with the conclusion that the signal functioned as a conditioned reinforcer and inconsistent with a generalization-decrement explanation...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the nature of}} external noise exclusion, we compared central spatial precuing effects in 16 conditions that varied the amount of external noise, the number of <b>signal</b> <b>stimuli,</b> the number of locations masked by external noise, and the number and style of frames surrounding potential target locations. In the absence of external noise, precuing produced only marginal performance improvements in {{a small number of}} display conditions. In the presence of high external noise, precuing improved task performance in all the display conditions. The magnitude of these spatial attention effects, as gauged by contrast threshold reduction, is nearly constant across all the display conditions. This suggests that spatial attention mostly excludes external noise at the target location; the presence of external noise and/or <b>signal</b> <b>stimuli</b> in non-target regions has little effect on spatial performance when location uncertainty is eliminated by report cues. However, the presence of other potential locations for the target is critical, because if target location is known in advance, attention can be focused on that location with or without a cue...|$|R

40|$|Proposes that neural {{inhibitory}} interaction underlies negative aftereffects {{as well as}} figural aftereffects, {{with the}} former occurring when nontopographic principles are used by the nervous system to <b>signal</b> <b>stimulus</b> values and the latter when topographic coding is involved.

It is concluded {{that even though the}} neural enhancement position cannot be tested in detail until more is known about tuning characteristics in sensory systems and the way cells respond to abrupt changes in stimulus value, in its present form it offers a more satisfactory explanation of negative aftereffects than normalization theory. There is little to support the latter claim that negative aftereffects occur as by-products of a perceptual adaptation process. (3 p. ref.)

40|$|Combining {{information}} from the visual and auditory senses can greatly enhance intelligibility of natural speech. Integration of audiovisual speech signals is robust even when temporal offsets are present between the component signals. In the present study, we characterized the temporal integration window for speech and nonspeech stimuli with similar spectrotemporal structure to investigate to what extent humans have adapted to the specific characteristics of natural audiovisual speech. We manipulated spectrotemporal structure of the auditory <b>signal,</b> <b>stimulus</b> length, and task context. Results indicate that the temporal integration window is narrower and more asymmetric for speech than for nonspeech signals. When perceiving audiovisual speech, subjects tolerate visual leading asynchronies, but are nevertheless very sensitive to auditory leading asynchronies that {{are less likely to}} occur in natural speech. Thus, speech perception may be fine-tuned to the natural statistics of audiovisual speech, where facial movements always occur before acoustic speech articulation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractNakayama and Tyler (1981) disentangled {{the use of}} pure motion (speed) {{information}} from spatial displacement information {{for the detection of}} lateral motion. They showed that when positional cues were removed the contribution of motion or spatial information was dependent on the temporal frequency: for temporal frequencies lower than 1 Hz the mechanism used to detect motion relied on speed information while for higher temporal frequencies a mechanism based on displacement information was used. Here we test whether the same dependency is also revealed in radial motion. In order to do so, we adapted the paradigm previously used by Nakayama and Tyler to obtain detection thresholds for lateral and radial motion by using a 2 -IFC procedure. Subjects had to report which of the intervals contained the <b>signal</b> <b>stimulus</b> (33 % coherent motion). We replicated the temporal frequency dependency for lateral motion but results indicate, however, that the detection of radial is always consistent with detecting a spatial displacement amplitude...|$|E

30|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} characteristics of the nerve synapse is its synaptic plasticity [27]. On the one hand, synaptic plasticity refers to the association between different signal stimuli in the presence of time. On the other hand, synaptic weight can be altered by pre- and post-synaptic stimulation in the spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) rule. The STDP is one of important synaptic adaptation rules in the competitive Hebbian learning theory. At the same time, it is necessary to simulate the brain function in artificial neural network [28]. When the presynaptic stimulation is earlier than the postsynaptic one, the synaptic efficiency will be enhanced, resulting in long-term potentiation. On the contrary, when the postsynaptic stimulation is earlier than the presynaptic one, the efficiency is reduced, resulting in long-term depression. Meanwhile, the change of synaptic weights in STDP has a close relationship with the relative time of presynaptic/postsynaptic stimulus. It also depends on the frequency of the <b>signal</b> <b>stimulus,</b> i.e., the time interval between different stimuli. In the above two points, there exists significant similarity between the memristor device and synapse.|$|E

40|$|The precise {{timing of}} action {{potentials}} of sensory neurons {{relative to the}} time of stimulus presentation carries substantial sensory information that is lost or degraded when these responses are summed over longer time windows. However, it is unclear whether and how downstream networks can access information in precise time-varying neural responses. Here, we review approaches to test the hypothesis that the activity of neural populations provides the temporal reference frames needed to decode temporal spike patterns. These approaches are based on comparing the single-trial stimulus discriminability obtained from neural codes defined with respect to network-intrinsic reference frames to the discriminability obtained from codes defined relative to the experimenter's computer clock. Application of this formalism to auditory, visual and somatosensory data shows that information carried by millisecond-scale spike times can be decoded robustly even with little or no independent external knowledge of stimulus time.

40|$|Behavioral {{responses}} {{obtained from}} chinchillas trained to discriminate a cosine-phase harmonic tone complex from wideband noise {{indicate that the}} perception of ‘pitch’ strength in chinchillas is largely influenced by periodicity information in the stimulus envelope. The perception of ‘pitch’ strength was examined in chinchillas in a stimulus generalization paradigm after animals had been retrained to discriminate infinitely iterated rippled noise from wideband noise. Retrained chinchillas gave larger behavioral responses to test stimuli having strong fine structure periodicity, but weak envelope periodicity. That is, chinchillas learn to use {{the information in the}} fine structure and consequently, their perception of ‘pitch’ strength is altered. Behavioral responses to rippled noises having similar periodicity strengths, but large spectral differences were also tested. Responses to these rippled noises were similar, suggesting a temporal analysis can be used to account for the behavior. Animals were then retested using the cosine-phase harmonic tone complex as the expected <b>signal</b> <b>stimulus.</b> Generalization gradients returned to those obtained originally in the naïve condition, suggesting that chinchillas do not remain “fine structure listeners,” but rather revert back to being “envelope listeners” when the periodicity strength in the envelope of the expected stimulus is high...|$|E

Stimuli for the rate discrimination task were pulse trains presented to one electrode, which could be in the apical, middle, or basal part of the array, and in either the left or the right ear. In each two-interval trial, the standard stimulus had a rate of 100, 200, 300, or 500 pulses per second and the <b>signal</b> <b>stimulus</b> had a rate 35 % higher. ITD discrimination between pitch-matched electrode pairs was measured for the same standard rates as in the rate discrimination task and with an ITD of +/ − 500 μs.

This study tested the hypothesis that deterioration in performance at high rates occurs for the two tasks due to a common neural basis, specific to the stimulation of each electrode. Results show that ITD scores for different pairs of electrodes correlated with the lower rate discrimination scores for those two electrodes.
