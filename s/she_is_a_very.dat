25|$|Bizarra is {{a fictional}} {{character}} appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Bizarra {{first appeared in}} DC Comics Presents #71 (July 1984), in a story written by E. Nelson Bridwell with art by Curt Swan. The character is a distorted version of the superhero Wonder Woman, based on the Superman villain Bizarro. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> simple-minded being, has reversed character traits, believes women are inferior to men, and speaks in reverse of what her true meaning is.|$|E
25|$|Luciana is Giovanni's {{youngest}} daughter, out of four. At {{thirteen years}} old, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> spoiled child. She returns early from her convent school {{to find that}} her father has taken Erik on as an apprentice. Entranced by the young Erik's air of mystery, Luciana takes an instant liking to him, but seems unable to express her feelings for him, so she teases and torments him. Erik is attracted to her {{as well as she}} is particularly beautiful for her age. Eventually, she requests that Giovanni remove Erik's mask, and after she has seen his ugliness, she runs away, falling from a section of crumbling roof of their two story house and dying a grotesquely violent end.|$|E

25|$|She is an {{extremely}} private person who keeps her thoughts and feelings to herself and hates when someone tries to understand her, which {{is thought to be}} why Edward is unable to hear her thoughts. She is also known to be incredibly stubborn with her self, because of her determination to become a vampire in order to be with Edward forever. She is also said to possess poor acting skills. Ironically, she demonstrates good acting ability in Twilight when she makes her father believe that she has dumped Edward and is leaving Forks. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> shy and timid girl with a stiff uptight position, habit of biting her lip, which she shares with Kristen Stewart. Bella knits together her eyebrows when feeling strong emotions such as anxiety. As a human, Bella easily fainted at the sight or smell of blood, which she said smells like rust and salt in Twilight, though it changes after she became a vampire. Bella is also shown in Breaking Dawn, to have a good mood climate, and is able to run away from the smell of human blood when she goes on her first hunting trip as a vampire.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the episode, the Doctor behaves erratically, as he {{gradually}} gets used to his {{new body}} and tastes while developing a new personality. Willis stated that he [...] "finally clicks into place" [...] after picking out his new outfit." [...] The rooftop scene {{was not in the}} original script; the Doctor simply ran away from the ward and returned to the TARDIS. Moffat felt that he did not really have a formal introduction, and that more could be made of the costume, as many previous Doctors had picked theirs out quietly. The main story arc is the Doctor meeting the grown-up Amy. Moffat felt that over time the relationships between the Doctor and his companions had become too adult. He wanted to create a childlike relationship like that between Peter Pan and Wendy, rather than boyfriend and girlfriend. He believed {{this was the kind of}} relationship viewers had with the Doctor, regardless of their age. When the Doctor returns for Amy, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> different person from the seven-year-old he had met before. Moffat explains that she developed a tough element and had become distrustful and cynical due to him not returning as promised, forcing her to accept that he was an imaginary friend. Rory was completely in love with Amy, but Amy wanted adventures before admitting she loved him, too. Moffat described Rory as someone who had grown up in the shadow of Amy's imaginary Doctor.|$|E
500|$|Live from Paris {{received}} generally favourable {{reviews from}} critics. Carlos Quintana from About.com gave the DVD {{a very positive}} review and praised the selection of songs, saying they were reflective of Shakira's [...] "evolution as an artist", and also commended her talent and performance, writing, [...] "Besides her sensual dancing, unique voice and great energy, you {{can tell from the}} images on the DVD <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> professional artist who takes her job very seriously". He concluded by calling the audio CD of Live from Paris a [...] "compilation [...] covers in a good way her musical spectrum" [...] and the DVD [...] "fantastic" [...] due to [...] "the high quality of the sound and the video"; he also commented that the live album [...] "offers a good overview of Shakira's musical career". Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic complimented the energy of the audio CD and Shakira's versatility, commenting she [...] "leans heavily on glitzy electro-dance crossovers but finds room for quieter moments, whether it’s a stripped-down cover of Metallica's [...] "Nothing Else Matters" [...] or her own [...] "Gypsy", keeping the momentum running throughout a lengthy set, then bringing down the house with [...] "Waka Waka". He, however, found the video versions much more impressive, opining that they [...] "give a greater indication {{of the size of the}} spectacle" [...] and [...] "emphasize Shakira's intense charisma". Adam Markovitz from Entertainment Weekly gave the live album a mixed review; he praised the visual show Shakira put up, but was critical of her vocals, saying [...] "she writhes and dry-humps through her catalog like the world's highest-paid strip-aerobics instructor, showing off plenty of skin — but sadly, not much musicianship". He also felt that Shakira's performance was too sexual, commenting that she [...] "sometimes comes off more stripper than superstar". The album was nominated [...] "Best Live DVD" [...] at the 2012 Premios Shock awards ceremony, ...|$|E

2500|$|Following the adoption, she was {{assigned}} to a nurse at Fontenay-aux-Roses and then a nanny, Madame Marque, before moving to her parents' residence, Holland House, London, in June 1853. Fox grew up unaware of her background. Her adoptive father died in 1859. As she approached her eighteenth birthday and marriageable age, her adoptive mother's legal advisor strongly recommended disclosing {{the information about the}} adoption to her. Lady Holland complied, but her own lack of full knowledge about the matter continued to pose problems. All people who knew the truth about the identity of her biological parents had died by then. Marie eventually became estranged from her adoptive mother. Her adoptive paternal aunt, Lady Lilford, wrote in 1867: [...] "Marie is much grown and improved. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> nice and affectionate girl, and has been thoroughly well educated." ...|$|E

He said that Hirsi Ali was a brave woman, but that her opinions were polarizing. Former parliamentary leader of the VVD, Jozias van Aartsen, {{said that it is}} [...] "painful for Dutch society and politics that she is leaving the House of Representatives". Another VVD MP, Bibi de Vries, said that if something were to happen to Hirsi Ali, some people in her party would have [...] "blood on their hands."

People come to her seeking her help and if she believes {{that they have been}} wronged, she helps them; however, if she thinks they deserve their fate, not only might she refuse to help them, she might also help to further their destruction. By day, she works as a physical education teacher at a girls' school, until it is destroyed by Slate. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> enigmatic person whose actions often seem contradictory; in one issue she tortures Black Mariah, and shortly thereafter she saves her life. For some time, she maintains a sexual relationship with Bete Noire's Magistrate, Doctor Juris, who in many ways is her counterpart in the city. She eventually gives birth to his son, Jude, and secretly leaves him in the care of an orphanage. Lee is not the first to serve as [...] "protector" [...] of Bete Noire; she has had more than one predecessor.|$|E
2500|$|Debnam-Carey {{viewed the}} {{betrayal}} as a relief and release for {{herself as an}} actor, and as a [...] "very honest" [...] and [...] "open" [...] moment for Lexa. [...] "It's the first real time you get to see—apart from —this is a scene where she makes a really strong choice, {{but you can see}} that it's hard for her to do, and she does care," [...] Debnam-Carey stated. She said Clarke's portrayer, Eliza Taylor, was [...] "brilliant" [...] and [...] "great to work with and between the two of us, we were just very connected with each other and made sure that that was the strong force of that scene." [...] To Debnam-Carey, Lexa [...] "showing that she cared, even in that moment of betrayal" [...] was Lexa being real. Debnam-Carey argued that even though Lexa was upset by the betrayal, <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> hardened person and her people continued to be her main concern. She does not think Lexa was preoccupied with the repercussions. Unlike Rothenberg, Debnam-Carey felt [...] " [...] always knew [...] was going to [...] Now those cards are back on the table, if she wants to restart an alliance or whatever else." ...|$|E
