50|$|A spiral <b>screw</b> <b>extractor</b> {{is itself}} a coarse-pitched tapered screw thread. They are {{generally}} left-handed, for use on right-handed threads, though there are right-handed extractors for removing left-handed screws.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>screw</b> <b>extractor</b> is a {{tool for}} {{removing}} broken or seized screws. There are two types: one has a spiral flute structure, commonly called an easy out after the trademarked name EZ-Out; [...] the other has a straight flute structure. Screw (and bolt) extractors are intentionally made of hard, brittle steel, and, if too much torque is applied, can break off inside the screw {{that is trying to}} be removed. Since the extractor is an extremely hard material, and a typical home shop drill bit {{will not be able to}} drill into it, a larger element of difficulty is added to the original screw extraction project. One way to avoid this added difficulty is to drill the hole completely through the screw or bolt (if there is access to the back). That way if it breaks a punch can be used to drive the easy out of the screw or bolt.|$|E
40|$|Two-stage dilute acid {{pretreatment}} {{followed by}} enzymatic cellulose hydrolysis {{is an effective}} method for obtaining high sugar yields from wood residues such as softwood forest thinnings. In the first-stage hydrolysis step, most of the hemicellulose is solubilized using relatively mild conditions. The soluble hemicellulosic sugars are recovered from the hydrolysate slurry by washing with water. The washed solids are then subjected to more severe hydrolysis conditions to hydrolyze approx 50 % of the cellulose to glucose. The remaining cellulose can further be hydrolyzed with cellulase enzyme. Our process simulation indicates {{that the amount of}} water used in the hemi-cellulose recovery step has {{a significant impact on the}} cost of ethanol produc-tion. It is important to keep water usage as low as possible while maintaining relatively high recovery of soluble sugars. To achieve this objective, a proto-type pilot-scale continuous countercurrent <b>screw</b> <b>extractor</b> was evaluated for the recovery of hemicellulose from pretreated forest thinnings. Using the 274 -cm (9 -ft) long extractor, solubles recoveries of 98, 91, and 77 % were obtained with liquid-to-insoluble solids (L/IS) ratios of 5. 6, 3. 4, and 2. 1, respectively. An empirical equation was developed to predict the perfor-mance of the <b>screw</b> <b>extractor.</b> This equation predicts that soluble sugar recov-ery above 95 % can be obtained with an L/IS ratio as low as 3. 0.

50|$|A {{tap wrench}} is a hand tool used to turn taps or other small tools, such as hand reamers and <b>screw</b> <b>extractors.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{drawback}} to tapered <b>screw</b> <b>extractors</b> {{is that their}} wedge action tends to expand the drilled, and thus weakened, screw. This wedging action can lock the screw even more tightly in place, making it difficult or impossible to extract.|$|R
50|$|Irwin Industrial Tools is an American {{manufacturer}} and distributor of hand tools and power tool accessories. It {{is owned by}} Stanley Black & Decker. It {{is best known for}} producing Vise-Grip locking pliers. Additionally, it produces clamps, drill bits, taps and dies, <b>screw</b> <b>extractors,</b> bolt extractors, saw blades, pipe wrenches, screwdrivers, snips, and other construction tools.|$|R
50|$|Straight fluted extractors {{have less}} wedging effect than tapered <b>screw</b> <b>extractors,</b> so have less {{tendency}} {{to lock the}} screws into place. A further form is a parallel fluted extractor, with no taper at all and thus no wedging. These work well, but have the drawback of requiring the pilot hole to be drilled to a precise size. This size is often non-standard for most drill sets, requiring a dedicated drill bit to be supplied with the kit.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>extractors</b> are {{essentially}} left-hand bits of specialized shape, used to remove common right-hand screws whose heads are broken or too damaged {{to allow a}} screwdriver tip to engage, making use of a screwdriver impossible. The extractor is pressed against the damaged head and rotated counter-clockwise and will tend to jam in the damaged head and then turn the screw counter-clockwise, unscrewing it. [...] For screws that break off deeper in the hole, an extractor set will often include left handed drill bits of the appropriate diameters so that grab holes can be drilled into the screws in a left handed direction, preventing further tightening of the broken piece.|$|R

The gun looks exactly like 155mm/39-cal M185 gun from M109A1 and is fitted with a double baffle muzzle brake, fume <b>extractor,</b> <b>screw</b> breech mechanism, hydro-pneumatic recuperator and a hydraulic recoil brake.|$|R
50|$|It uses a turret {{that has}} a similar layout to the M109A1 155mm/39-cal {{self-propelled}} howitzer. The Iranian Defense Industries Organization claimed that the 155 mm HM44 howitzer manufactured by the Hadid facility of the Iranian Defense Industries Organization had a high firing rate and accuracy. It was described as being able to fire five rounds per minute. The gun's range was reported as 30 km, and it also includes features such as a laser range-finder and a semi-automatic loading system. The gun looks exactly like 155mm/39-cal M185 gun from M109A1 and is fitted with a double baffle muzzle brake, fume <b>extractor,</b> <b>screw</b> breech mechanism, hydro-pneumatic recuperator and a hydraulic recoil brake. It uses the Iranian-made Boragh APC chassis, a conversion of the either the Russian BMP-1 or Chinese Type 86 (WZ-501) IFV. It was described as being able to move with a speed of 70 km/h (43 mph) on the battlefield.|$|R
