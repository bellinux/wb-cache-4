25|$|The {{first woman}} {{mathematician}} recorded by history was Hypatia of Alexandria (AD 350 - 415). She succeeded her father as Librarian at the Great Library and wrote many works on applied mathematics. Because {{of a political}} dispute, the Christian community in Alexandria punished her, presuming she was involved, by stripping her naked and <b>scraping</b> <b>off</b> her skin with clamshells (some say roofing tiles).|$|E
25|$|Thus, the {{specialised}} cornified {{structures of}} the hoof are the wall, the sole, the frog and periople. The wall does not exfoliate at all; it is constantly growing downward (about 1cm per month), and self-trims by wearing or chipping by ground contact, in wild and feral horses. Solar, frog and periople material grow outwards and exfoliate at the surface by ground contact and wearing. In the domesticated horse, movement and typical ground hardness are insufficient to allow self-trimming, so humans have to care for them, trimming {{the walls and the}} frog, and <b>scraping</b> <b>off</b> the dead sole.|$|E
25|$|Lead may be {{introduced}} into glass either as an ingredient {{of the primary}} melt or added to preformed leadless glass or frit. The lead oxide used in lead glass could be obtained {{from a variety of}} sources. In Europe, galena, lead sulfide, was widely available, which could be smelted to produce metallic lead. The lead metal would be calcined to form lead oxide by roasting it and <b>scraping</b> <b>off</b> the litharge. In the medieval period lead metal could be obtained through recycling from abandoned Roman sites and plumbing, even from church roofs. Metallic lead was demanded in quantity for silver cupellation, and the resulting litharge could be used directly by glassmakers. Lead was also used for ceramic lead glazes. This material interdependence suggests a close working relationship between potters, glassmakers, and metalworkers.|$|E

500|$|The boat {{made its}} first foray outside Russia in 1997 when it was {{displayed}} in the Winter Garden Atrium of the World Financial Center in New York City. [...] While being displayed {{as part of the}} [...] "St. Petersburg: A Cultural Celebration" [...] festival, the boat was attended to by two preservationists. [...] The preservationists attempted to identify the species of oak used in the boat so that the country of origin could be determined in addition to <b>scraping</b> <b>off</b> dirt and patching cracks.|$|E
500|$|The dried bark, however, {{is still}} an {{officinal}} drug and is listed in the modern Chinese materia medica as chun bai pi (...) , meaning [...] "white bark of spring". Modern works treat it in detail, discussing chemical constituents, how to identify the product and its pharmaceutical uses. It is prepared by felling the tree in fall or spring, stripping the bark and then <b>scraping</b> <b>off</b> the hardest, outermost portion, which is then sun-dried, soaked in water, partially re-dried in a basket and finally cut into strips. The bark {{is said to have}} cooling and astringent properties and is primarily used to treat dysentery, intestinal hemorrhage, menorrhagia and spermatorrhea. It is only prescribed in amounts between 4 and 10grams, so as not to poison the patients. Li's Compendium has 18 recipes that call for the bark. Asian and European chemists have found some justification for its medical use as it contains a long list of active chemicals that include quassin and saponin, while ailanthone, the allelopathic chemical in the tree of heaven, is a known antimalarial agent. It is available in most shops dealing in Chinese traditional medicine. A tincture of the root-bark has been used successfully in treating cardiac palpitation, asthma and epilepsy.|$|E
500|$|Verdigris is made {{by placing}} a plate or blade of copper, brass or bronze, {{slightly}} warmed, into a vat of fermenting wine, leaving it there for several weeks, and then <b>scraping</b> <b>off</b> and drying the green powder that forms on the metal. The process of making verdigris was described in ancient times by Pliny. It {{was used by the}} Romans in the murals of Pompeii, and in Celtic medieval manuscripts as early as the 5th century AD. It produced a blue-green which no other pigment could imitate, but it had drawbacks; it was unstable, it could not resist dampness, it did not mix well with other colors, it could ruin other colors with which it came into contact., and it was toxic. Leonardo da Vinci, in his treatise on painting, warned artists not to use it. It was widely used in miniature paintings in Europe and Persia in the 16th and 17th centuries. Its use largely ended in the late 19th century, when it was replaced by the safer and more stable chrome green. Viridian, also called chrome green, is a pigment made with chromium oxide dihydrate, was patented in 1859. [...] It became popular with painters, since, unlike other synthetic greens, it was stable and not toxic. Vincent van Gogh used it, along with Prussian blue, to create a dark blue sky with a greenish tint in his painting Cafe terrace at night.|$|E

500|$|Hollows can be [...] {{deep and}} [...] wide, with {{a base of}} woodchips. A chance felling of a {{eucalypt}} {{known to have been}} used as a nesting tree near Scottsdale in northeastern Tasmania allowed accurate measurements to be made, yielding a hollow measuring [...] high by [...] wide at the mouth, and at least [...] deep, in a tree which measured [...] in diameter below the hollow. Both the male and female prepare the hollow for breeding, which involves peeling or <b>scraping</b> <b>off</b> wood shavings from the inside the hollow to prepare bedding for the eggs. Gum leaves are occasionally added as well. The clutch consists of one or two white lustreless rounded oval eggs which may have the occasional lime nodule. The first egg averages around 47 or 48mm long and 37mm in diameter (2 × 1.4in). The second egg is around 2mm smaller all over and is laid two to seven days later. The female incubates the eggs alone and begins after the completion of laying. She enters the hollow feet first, and is visited by the male who brings food two to four times a day. Later both parents help to raise the chicks. The second chick is neglected and usually perishes in infancy. Information on the breeding of birds in the wild is lacking; however, the incubation period in captivity is 28–31days. Newly hatched chicks are covered with yellow down and have pink beaks that fade to a greyish white by the time of fledging. Chicks fledge from the nest three months after hatching, and remain in the company of their parents until the next breeding season.|$|E
2500|$|In Gresham's day, bad money {{included}} any coin {{that had}} been debased. Debasement was often done by the issuing body, where less than the officially specified amount of precious metal was contained in an issue of coinage, usually by alloying it with a base metal. [...] The public could also debase coins, usually by clipping or <b>scraping</b> <b>off</b> small portions of the precious metal, also known as [...] "stemming" [...] (reeded edges on coins were intended to make clipping evident). Other examples of bad money include counterfeit coins made from base metal. Today all circulating coins are made from base metals, known as fiat money.|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of glued joints in the instrument use animal hide glue rather than common white glue {{for a number}} of reasons. Hide glue is capable of making a thinner joint than most other glues, it is reversible (brittle enough to crack with carefully applied force, and removable with very warm water) when disassembly is needed, and since fresh hide glue sticks to old hide glue, more original wood can be preserved when repairing a joint. (More modern glues must be cleaned off entirely for the new joint to be sound, which generally involves <b>scraping</b> <b>off</b> some wood along with the old glue.) Weaker, diluted glue is usually used to fasten the top to the ribs, and the nut to the fingerboard, since common repairs involve removing these parts. The purfling running {{around the edge of the}} spruce top provides some protection against cracks originating at the edge. It also allows the top to flex more independently of the rib structure. Painted-on [...] purfling on the top is usually a sign of an inferior instrument. The back and ribs are typically made of maple, most often with a matching striped figure, referred to as flame, fiddleback, or tiger stripe.|$|E

It is perfectly marvellous how a gunstock, {{that has been}} shattered into splinters, can be made as strong again as ever, by means of raw hide sewn round it and left to dry; or by drawing the skin of an ox's leg like a stocking over it. It is well to treat your bit of skin as though parchment (which see) were {{to be made of}} it, burying the skin and <b>scraping</b> <b>off</b> the hair, before sewing it on, that it may make no eyesore.

The machinery, by which the frame with its log to be sawn was moved along quarter-inch by quarter-inch at each stroke, was indeed all right, but it had not been made self-regulating. The result was that, on one of the attendant workmen omitting to do his duty, the saw not only ripped off a beautiful plank from a log, but continued to cross-cut the end of the heavy framework, and then proceeded to cut the iron which held the log in its place. The result, of course, was that the iron refused to be cut, and savagely revenged itself by <b>scraping</b> <b>off,</b> flattening down, turning up, and otherwise damaging, the teeth of the saw! ...|$|E
60|$|Dove was peculiarly good at {{what may}} be styled toast-cooking. Indeed, all the lightkeepers were equally good.

Dove had a liberal heart, and he laid on the butter with a liberal hand. Fair play and no favour was his motto, quarter-inch thick was his gauge, railway speed his practice. The consequence was that the toast floated, as it were, down the throats of the men, and compensated to some extent for the want of milk in the tea.|$|E
