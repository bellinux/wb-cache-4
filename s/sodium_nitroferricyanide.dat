50|$|Sodium nitroprusside is {{also used}} as an {{analytical}} reagent under the name <b>sodium</b> <b>nitroferricyanide</b> {{for the detection of}} methyl ketones, and for the detection of amines that are often found in illicit drugs. Sodium nitroprusside was found by Legal to give a reaction with acetone or creatine under basic conditions in 1882. Rothera refined this method by the use of ammonia in place of sodium or potassium hydroxide. The reaction was now specific for methyl ketones. Addition of ammonium salts (e.g. ammonium sulfate) improved the sensitivity of the test, too.|$|E
40|$|Convalent enzyme-antibody conjugates {{have been}} {{extensively}} employed for the immunochemical locali-zation of cellular antigens (2. 5). This method is sometimes {{limited by the}} necessity to distinguish between endogenous enzyme activity and enzyme activity due to labeled antibody. This distinction is facilitated if the endogenous enzyme activity is de-stroyed while antigenic activity is preserved. Straus (6) used 1 % <b>sodium</b> <b>nitroferricyanide</b> and 1 % acetic acid in methanol as a fixative to destroy endogenous peroxidase activity. This fixative was recently applied in this laboratory to immunochemi-cal localization of cellular antigens by a peroxidase-antibody conjugate. Streefkerk (7) destroyed endoge-nous peroxidase activity by treatment with methano...|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} paper (1), we have mentioned various studies dealing with thioureas and sul-fonamides which {{have led to}} the use of one of the thiourea derivatives, thiouracil, in the treatment of patients with thyrotoxicosis (2, 3). Evidence continues to accumulate that when this drug is administered to patients or experimental animals, the production of thyroid hormone is inhibited, resulting in a fall of the basal oxygen consump-tion, increased activity of the anterior pituitary, and consequent hyperplasia of the thyroid gland. We have also pointed out (1) the importance of knowing more about the pharmacological proper-ties of this drug, particularly the rate of absorp-tion and excretion and its metabolism. For these studies, we found that it was necessary to establish methods for the estimation of this sub-stance in tissues and body fluids. The methods which we found suitable (1) are based on Grote's observation (4) that a color develops when sub-stances of a C =S type are treated with a special <b>sodium</b> <b>nitroferricyanide</b> reagent. Thiouracil 3 has the C =S linkage and we found that it gives a greenish color which can be estimated by means of an Evelyn photoelectric colorimeter. We re-fer the reader to our previous report (1) for a consideration of the specificity of the method. However, we wish to state here that whereas we have not proved directly that all of the color obtained is attributable to thiouracil, the evi-dence strongly suggests that such is the case. ABSORPTION AND EXCRETION In conducting the experiments relating to the absorption and excretion of thiouracil the follow-ing points were investigated: IThis investigation was aided by a grant from th...|$|E
