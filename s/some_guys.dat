5|$|Youkilis is an on-base machine. He never swings at a bad pitch, and is {{adept at}} working counts and out-thinking the pitcher. Unlike <b>some</b> <b>guys</b> who draw lots of walks, Youkilis seldom strikes out. He makes solid contact against both fastballs and {{breaking}} pitches. Youkilis' swing is tailored for the line drive, {{and he may}} never hit for much home run power. But he hits balls to the gaps effectively, and could develop 10–14 home run power down the road. Youkilis does not have very good speed, though he is a decent baserunner. His defense at third base draws mixed reviews. His arm, range, and hands all rate as adequate/average. He doesn't kill the defense at third base, but he doesn't help it much, either, {{and is likely to}} end up at first base down the road.|$|E
25|$|Richie {{is able to}} {{secretly}} abstract JR's bone marrow, while setting JR up to look {{as though}} he was out all night with a hooker the day he went missing. A drugged-up JR, unaware that his bone marrow has been stolen, insists to his family and Babe that he was drugged and he knows Richie did this to him. Initially Krystal is the only one to believe JR, but Babe later finds out that JR is telling the truth about Richie and apologizes to him. She sees Richie pay the hooker that was with JR the night Richie stole his bone marrow. Babe punches out the hooker. She goes on a mission to find out what other stuff Richie has done to JR or anyone else. During this mission, JR saves Babe from being raped by <b>some</b> <b>guys</b> when she goes undercover as a prostitute to clear JR's name and find out what crimes Richie did. Trina decides to tell the truth about Richie and her part in framing JR when Richie stole his bone marrow. JR promises Trina some money to get out of prostituting and go somewhere Richie is not due to fear that Richie will kill her since she told JR what Richie did. With Richie finally gone, JR and Babe come happily together again.|$|E
500|$|Enforcers {{typically}} only fight each other, {{with only}} the occasional spontaneous fight breaking out between one or two opponents who do not usually fight. There is {{a high degree of}} respect among enforcers as well; they will respect a rival who declines a fight because he is playing with injuries, a frequent occurrence, because enforcers consider winning a fight with an injured opponent to be an empty victory. This is also known as granting a [...] "free pass".

500|$|Davis played {{through a}} {{shoulder}} injury early in the 1993 season. Defensive end Reggie White, who signed with the Green Bay Packers following the 1992 season after spending eight seasons with the Eagles and earned seven Pro Bowl selections, said that he believed he destroyed Davis' confidence as a rookie and second-year player, as Davis had to go up against White in practice every week. White said [...] "there are <b>some</b> <b>guys</b> who get very discouraged because they can't block you. I {{think that was the}} situation at times with Antone." [...] Davis, however, disputed White's statements as the Eagles played against the Packers in the second week of the season. Dave Goldberg, a writer for the Associated Press, named Davis to his [...] "all-" [...] team after his performance against White. Davis started in every game for the Eagles at right tackle in 1993.|$|E

Veeck wrote that he told Landis, who reacted with shock, and soon moved to block the purchase. In his book, Veeck placed {{some of the blame}} on National League President Ford Frick, but later reserved blame exclusively for Landis, whom he accused of racism, stating in a subsequent interview, [...] "fter all, a man who is named Kenesaw Mountain was not {{born and raised in the}} state of Maine." [...] However, when Veeck was asked for proof of his allegations against Landis, he stated, [...] "I have no proof of that. I can only surmise." [...] According to baseball historian David Jordan, [...] "Veeck, nothing if not a storyteller, seems to have added these embellishments, sticking in <b>some</b> <b>guys</b> in black hats, simply to juice up his tale." ...|$|E

Stunt coordinator and second unit director Kevin Scott was tasked with depicting the four Navy SEALs tumbling down rugged terrain with sixty-degree inclines. Scott did not choreograph the stunt work, nor did he have the stunt performers use wires or dummies; he told them to fall [...] off cliffs and avoid looking at the ground until right before impact. [...] "We had to say, ‘Jump off the rock, land however you land, and go with it,’" [...] he said. [...] "When you’re doing that on a true hillside, you don’t have a choice. Gravity takes over. The only thing stopping the stunt people from dropping another thousand feet down the hillside was padding set up just outside of the shot." [...] Several stunt performers were injured after falling from the mountains, as the falls proved too difficult to control. Berg recalled, [...] "Some guys got hurt, <b>some</b> <b>guys</b> got bumped up and ribs were broken, a lung was punctured, some concussions, but these guys were determined to try and do everything they could to capture what Marcus described in the book."

500|$|Hoffman {{explained}} {{the key to}} his changeup was how he pinched the seam of the ball with his thumb and index finger as he released it. He threw the changeup with the arm speed used to throw a fastball, and the spin and movement of the ball looked the same to the batter. His changeup ranged from 73–76mph. Bruce Bochy, who managed Hoffman for over a decade with the Padres, said of Hoffman's changeup: [...] "He pitched so well off his fastball [...] couldn't just sit on it every pitch." [...] "You could be sitting on [...] and still not be successful with it", says former player Mark Sweeney. It was the arm action on the change up and the late sink just before it reached the plate that allowed Hoffman to stay successful over the years. With opponents flailing to slow down their swings, teammates nicknamed Hoffman's changeup The Bugs Bunny Pitch after a famous Bugs Bunny cartoon episode. [...] "Some [...] fool you. <b>Some</b> <b>guys</b> overpower you. Hoffman embarrasses you", said former rival and later teammate Mike Piazza. After striking out on a changeup to end the game against Hoffman, Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca said, [...] "It's like it has a parachute on it." [...] As Hoffman lost velocity on his fastball throughout his career, he compensated by maintaining a notable speed differential between that pitch and his changeup. He initially kept the grip of his changeup a secret. [...] "I was a little weird about it", Hoffman said. [...] "I didn't like talking about how I threw the change. I didn't want people to see how I gripped the ball. I thought I'd be giving away something to the hitters." [...] Later in his career, he posed for pictures of his grip, figuring everyone had seen it.|$|E

I don't see why you have to be 19 to play a game of basketball when you can be 18 and go to war for our country and die. It's ridiculous." [...] Jerryd Bayless said [...] "It's not fair at all. If a tennis player can go pro at 13, I don't understand why a basketball player can't go pro at 18." [...] A possible number one pick out of high school, had the rule not been put in place, was Greg Oden (though he was still picked first in 2007). When asked about the agreement he said [...] "It's unfair, but it's over with now, so there's no reason to complain." [...] In spite of the claims that the rule is unfair, Wayne Ellington of North Carolina, said that [...] "…I also think it's going to help the league a little bit. <b>Some</b> <b>guys</b> who come in, like from this year's draft, it will help."
