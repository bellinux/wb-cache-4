5|$|The Catholic {{community}} in Afghanistan is mainly made of foreigners, especially aid workers, and no Afghans {{are known to}} be currently part of the Church, mainly due to great social and legal pressure not to convert to non-Islamic religions. Some Afghans have converted while overseas, but they keep it secret when they return. Two Christian groups, Church World Service and Norwegian Church Aid, were accused of proselytizing while doing aid work in Afghanistan, which they denied, and 1,000 Afghans protested in Mazar-i-Sharif and burned the pope in effigy. Despite this, the community has grown from only a few sisters to a full <b>Sunday</b> <b>Mass</b> of around 100. Church attendance dipped in 2012 due to security concerns and less emphasis on religion among the foreigners in Afghanistan in recent years.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, the Comos {{celebrated their}} silver wedding anniversary {{with a family}} trip to Italy. On the {{itinerary}} was an audience with Pope Pius XII. Como, who sat in a side wing of the Long Island church where he attended <b>Sunday</b> <b>Mass</b> {{in an effort to}} avoid attracting attention, was both puzzled and upset on returning home that photos from the visit made the newspapers throughout the world. A thorough check of both the Como and NBC publicity offices found that neither was responsible for the release of the photos to the media; it was done by the Vatican's press department. When Perry and Roselle became Knight Commander and Lady Commander of the Equestrian Order of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre in 1952, it was a news item only after Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen, who had been honored at the same ceremony, mentioned it some time later.|$|E

25|$|The {{publication}} of Summorum Pontificum {{has led to}} {{an increase in the number}} of regularly scheduled public Tridentine Masses.

25|$|In June 1927 {{a general}} {{election}} was held in which de Valera's new party, Fianna Fáil, won many seats on an abstentionist platform. In July the Minister for Justice, Kevin O'Higgins, was assassinated {{on his way home}} from <b>Sunday</b> <b>Mass</b> by the IRA. Cosgrave had legislation passed to force Fianna Fáil to take their seats in the Dáil and this proved successful with de Valera and his party entering the Dáil. Previously, without de Valera, Cosgrave faced very little opposition, giving him considerable freedom of action. However, de Valera's arrival significantly altered the situation.|$|E

25|$|The Tour of Flanders {{has started}} in four {{different}} cities – Ghent, Sint-Niklaas, Bruges and Antwerp. The {{start of the}} inaugural event in 1913 was on the Korenmarkt in Ghent's historic city center.

Later, the official start in Ghent moved to the fashionable Albert Hotel, close to St-Pieters Station, where riders signed on. Until the 1950s a <b>Sunday</b> <b>Mass</b> was held for riders before the start, as the race was often held just before the Holy Week or on Easter day.|$|E
25|$|The Breton {{people are}} {{predominantly}} {{members of the}} Catholic Church, with minorities in the Reformed Church of France and non-religious people. Brittany {{was one of the}} most staunchly Catholic regions in all of France. Attendance at <b>Sunday</b> <b>mass</b> dropped during the 1970s and the 1980s, but other religious practices such as pilgrimages have experienced a revival. This includes the Tro Breizh, which takes place in the shrines of the seven founding saints of Breton Christianity. The Christian tradition is widely respected by both believers and nonbelievers, who see it as a symbol of Breton heritage and culture.|$|E
25|$|Milan Bandić heavily used {{religion}} {{as an issue}} in the campaign, calculating that Josipović's agnosticism would be a turn-off for a largely Catholic country as Croatia. He constantly repeated the only one he fears is God and that he was raised as a true believer and a humble Christian, also making claims that he has the support of the Catholic Church. Josipović largely ignored Bandić's attempts saying he would be the president of all Croatians no matter their religious beliefs. The incumbent president Stjepan Mesić was elected twice despite his atheism. However, the Bandić campaign used all tactics to force the issue, even distributing fliers in front of churches after the <b>Sunday</b> <b>mass</b> across the country urging believers to choose between the cross and a red star, referencing communism.|$|E

25|$|After {{leaving the}} Brazil Squadron, Boarman succeeded Captain William D. Salter as {{commander}} of the Brooklyn Navy Yard and remained {{in charge of the}} facility from October 14, 1852 to October 1, 1855. In the four-year period he and his family were stationed in Brooklyn one of his daughters, Mary Jane Boarman, began a relationship with William Henry Broome, longtime deputy collector of the New York Custom House; the two may have been introduced through Broome's brother John L. Broome who was serving as a marine lieutenant at the navy yard. They were married in a modest ceremony at the Commandant's House, officiated by Archbishop John Hughes, on October 18, 1853; the family regularly attended <b>Sunday</b> <b>Mass</b> at St. James' Cathedral, in all kinds of weather, where Boarman was a pew holder. Boarman later bought the house and lot that Mary Ann lived at in Brooklyn and, after her husband's death in 1876, left the property to her in his will.|$|E
25|$|Under the concordat, the Church enjoyed full {{protection}} of the State and prayed for the leaders of Poland during <b>Sunday</b> <b>mass</b> and on 3 May. Clerics made a solemn oath of allegiance to the Polish State. If clergy were under accusation, trial documents would be forwarded to ecclesiastical authorities if clergy were accused of crimes. If convicted, they would not serve incarceration in jails but would be handed over to Church authorities for internment in a monastery or convent. The concordat extended to the Latin Rite in five ecclesiastical provinces: Gniezno and Poznań, Warsaw, Wilno, Lwów and Cracow. It applied as well to united Catholics of the Greco-Ruthenian rite in Lwów, and Przemyśl, and to the Armenian Rite in Lwów. For religious celebration in the specific rites, Canon law was required to be observed. Catholic instruction was mandatory in all public schools, except universities. In Article 24, the Church and State recognized each other's property rights seeming {{in part from the}} time of partition before 1918. This meant that property rights and real estate titles of the Church were respected. A later agreement was to define the status of expropriated Church properties, and until that time, the State would pay Church dotations for its clergy. The concordat stipulated that no part of Polish territory could be placed under the jurisdiction of a bishop outside of Poland or not of Polish citizenship.|$|E
