5000|$|The BIX Façade of {{the museum}} {{represents}} a singular fusion from architecture and New Media {{and is based on}} a concept of the Berliner architects realities:united. BIX, a name which consists of the words [...] "Big" [...] and [...] "pixels" [...] is the acrylic glass skin of {{the eastern side of the}} building toward the Mur and city center and represents an oversize urban screen, which serves as an instrument for artistic productions. BIX projects accompany different exhibitions and are not transported into the public area, also the direct environment is defined and shaped. Beyond that the [...] "communicating outer skin" [...] offers also a possible drilling platform for art projects, which bring up for discussion the dialogue between media and area. 930 40 Watt fluorescent rings are embedded in the 900 m² outer skin, with the illumination level of each one being <b>steplessly</b> <b>variable</b> between 0 and 100%. Each light ring functions as a pixel, which can be served by a central computer. In this way they can be developed as roughly screened indications, texts and film sequences, which radiate far into the urban area and thus, the blue blister of Graz with a screen of immense size makes an art gallery.|$|E

Significant {{technical}} {{advances have}} been made in the design, develop-ment and in bringing out prototypes of most modern transmission for the Main Battle Tank by the CVRDE, Avadi. The transmission has been designed a s a semi-automatic, heavy duty, power-transmission-cum-steeriqg unit to provide for four forward and two reverse speeds with a <b>steplessly</b> <b>variable</b> radii of turn in each gear together with neutral turn capability. Test bed results are very encouraginp and have shown the transmission's ability to transmit 1000 horse-power at an overall efficiency of around 90 per cent which is quite comparable to some of the best designs developed elsewhere. 1...|$|E

Operation is in the elastohydrodynamic lubrication regime with peak contact pressures of 1. 5 to 3. 0 GPa. Good agreement with the measurements is demonstrated by a visco-plastic lubricant model, and contrary to the conclusions of other recent work it is shown {{that the effects of}} elastic compliance of the fluid and rolling elements are small. The ability of the theory to account for the influence of the main operating variables, and its simplicity, should facilitate the solution of certain transmission design problems.
