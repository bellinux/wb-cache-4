50|$|Waterville {{remains an}} {{industrial}} centre, with three internationally recognized companies, {{one of which}} is Waterville TG, acquired by the Japanese giant Gosei in 1988 and specializing in auto-part manufacturing. Aside from the rubber, plastic moulding and woodworking factories, Waterville is also host to a number of interesting buildings: the mansard-style Gale family residence, now the Foyer Waterville; the Anglican church on the corner of Principale and Compton Ouest; a covered bridge dating from {{the second half of the}} 19th century; and the Ball residence, a Queen-Anne style house which belonged to the founders of the Dominion Snath company, once a North American leader in <b>scythe</b> <b>handle</b> production. The former Ball residence now houses a bed and breakfast. The nine-hole Bonnie View Golf Club, now known as the Waterville Golf Club, is among Quebec's oldest links.|$|E
25|$|By 1875, Charlemont's {{industrial}} base {{was limited to}} several sawmills, two <b>scythe</b> snathes (<b>handles)</b> shops and a chair making operation. With the opening and success of the Davis iron pyrite and talc mine in Rowe in the 1880s, a prospecting craze developed in the area. In 1892 the main shaft was 501 feet deep, and production {{was reported to be}} 334,552 tons of pyrite.|$|R
5000|$|Club members wear vests {{known as}} kuttes. The SOA patch {{on the back}} is a Grim Reaper holding a crystal ball with the Anarchist circle-A symbol, and {{wielding}} the Reaper's traditional <b>scythe,</b> the <b>handle</b> {{of which has been}} replaced by the M16 rifle that the founders wielded in Vietnam. Only full members can wear the [...] "patch". Other smaller patches have specific meanings, such as [...] "Men of Mayhem" [...] worn by club members who have spilled blood on the club's behalf, [...] "First 9", worn by the original nine members, and those for the President/Vice President/Sergeant at Arms/Secretary. Kelli Jones was the costume designer for all the seasons. Due to its popularity, replicas of the vests, with the same style of top pockets, zips and button clasps, have become popular on various auction sites.|$|R
