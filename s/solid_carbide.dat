50|$|An {{acoustic}} emission (AE) sensor {{works on}} principle of measuring the high-frequency energy signals produced during cutting process. It also measures the AE energy {{resulting from the}} fracture when a tool breaks. It is best suited to applications where the level of background AE signal is low compared {{to the sound of}} tool breakage. This makes the AE sensor ideal for breakage detection of small drills and taps. It is easy to install on both new and existing machines. AE sensor detects force proportional monitoring signals even in machining operations, which generate very small cutting forces. In combination with true power, it increases the reliability of breakage monitoring. It is used especially with <b>solid</b> <b>carbide</b> tools, or very small tools on large machines and multi spindles. Most of the sensors have to be attached to the machine tool surface. However, there are alternative methods of AE wave transmitting. A rotating, wireless AE sensor consists of a rotating sensor and a fixed receiver. An AE sensor can also receive the acoustic waves via a jet of cooling lubricant, which can be connected directly to the tool or workpiece.|$|E

A framework for the ICME (Integrated Computational Materials Engineering) based Materials Design is presented to accelerate the {{development of}} alternative binder systems. Part one of this work deals with the design of the cemented carbide composite hardness. It has been shown that the intrinsic binder hardness is comparable to a bulk metal alloy and that based on the binder solubilities a solid solution strengthening model developed in this work can be employed. Using a method presented in this work the non-equilibrium, frozen-in binder solubilities can be obtained. Both the design of the binder phase and composite hardness is presented based on a general Materials Design approach. Part two deals with a multiscale approach to model the surface gradient formation. The experimentally missing data on liquid binder diffusion has been calculated using AIMD (Ab initio Molecular Dynamics). The diffusion through the liquid cemented carbide binder has to be reduced to an effective diffusion value due to the <b>solid</b> <b>carbides</b> acting as obstacles that increase the diffusion path. The geometrical reduction of the diffusion has been investigated experimentally using the SIMS (secondary ion mass spectroscopy) technique in WC-Nickel- 58 Nickel diffusion couples. The geometrical contribution of the so-called labyrinth factor has been proven by the combination of the experiments and in conjunction with DICTRA simulations using the precise liquid AIMD diffusivities. Unfortunately, despite the improved kinetic database and the geometrical diffusion reduction, the surface gradient formation cannot be explained satisfactory in complex cemented carbide grades. Additional, but so far unidentified, contributions have to be considered to predict the surface gradient thickness. QC 20170919 </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractNickel-based {{superalloys}} {{constitute a}} significant portion of the materials used in important industries such as aerospace, energy production, automotive, and biomedical industries. Due to their superior properties that make them appealing for these industries such as their high strength at elevated operating temperatures, manufacturing these alloys to end product specifications has been a difficult task. Despite the several recent studies that unearth various methods to tackle different aspects of this challenge, machining of nickel-based superalloys continues to be a mostly unknown territory. Researchers have mostly worked on finding optimal machining parameters that provide milder operating conditions, lower cost of tooling, or better end-product dimensional accuracy and surface quality; however, the tool material and type are generally constant in these studies. Therefore, it is difficult to apply the information gathered from these studies when there is a change in the machine tool that has been used, as it frequently happens when tool manufacturers produce new tools that perform better. In this study, an alternative glance at the bigger picture is presented, providing an insight toward a generalized model that directly addresses the industrial concern of process cost. <b>Solid</b> <b>carbide</b> and ceramic tools, which are known to be heavily utilized in manufacturing gas turbine components, are investigated by their performance as well as the relative cost they induce during end milling the gamma-prime strengthened nickel-based superalloy.

40|$|Tantalum carbide (TaC) and hafnium carbide (HfC) possess {{extremely}} high melting points, around 3900 oC, {{which are the}} highest among the known materials. TaC and HfC exhibit superior oxidation resistance under oxygen deficient and rich environments, respectively. A versatile material can be expected by forming solid solutions of TaC and HfC. However, the synthesis of fully dense <b>solid</b> solution <b>carbide</b> is a challenge due to their intrinsic covalent bonding which makes sintering challenging. The aim of the present work is to synthesize full dense TaC-HfC solid solutions by spark plasma sintering with five compositions: pure HfC, HfC- 20 vol. % TaC (T 20 H 80), HfC- 50 vol. % TaC (T 50 H 50), HfC- 80 vol. % TaC (T 80 H 20), and pure TaC. To evaluate the oxidation behavior of the <b>solid</b> solutions <b>carbides</b> {{in an environment that}} simulates the various applications, an oxygen rich, plasma assisted flow experiment was developed. While exposed to the plasma flow, samples were exposed to a temperature of approximately 2800 oC with a gas flow speed greater than 300 m/s. Density measurements confirm near full density was achieved for all compositions, with the highest density measured in the HfC-contained samples, all consolidated without sintering aids. Confirmation of solid solution was completed using x-ray diffraction, which had an excellent match with the theoretical values computed using Vegard’s Law, which confirmed the formation of the solid solutions. The solid solution samples showed much improved oxidation resistance compared to the pure carbide samples, and the T 50 H 50 samples exhibited the best oxidation resistance of all samples.
