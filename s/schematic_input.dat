40|$|Just {{about all}} {{electrical}} engineers {{have some form}} of encounter with SPICE, Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis. It could be in a homework assignment during the undergraduate studies, or as an essential part of circuit design at work. As its full name suggests, SPICE is a computer program that accepts a circuit <b>schematic</b> as <b>input</b> and outputs the simulated circuit behaviors. The simulation can be performed under the nonlinear dc, nonlinear transient and linearized ac operating conditions. The circuit may contain resistors, capacitors, inductors, mutual inductors, independent voltage and current sources, dependent sources, lossless and lossy transmission lines, switches, uniform distributed RC lines, and various semiconductor devices including MOSFETs (metal oxide semiconductor fieldeffect transistors). The original SPICE program, SPICE 1, was developed at University of California, Berkeley, and released for public use in May, 1972. By 1975, after the next major release, called SPICE 2, SPICE was in widespread use and adopted by most integrated circuit manufacturers. SPICE 2 was written in Fortran. With the advent of UNIX computers in the 1980 s it became increasingly obvious that SPIC...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the results of {{research in the area of}} automated recognition of digital logic schematics. The adaptation of a number of existing image processing techniques for use with this kind of image is discussed, and the concept of using sets of tokens to represent the overall drawing i s explained in detail. Methods are given for using tokens to describe schematic component shapes, to represent the connections between components, and to provide sufficient information to a parser so that an equation can be generated. A Microsoft Windows-based test program which runs under Windows 95 or Windows NT has been written to implement the ideas presented. This program accepts either scanned images of digital schematics, or computer-generated images in Microsoft Windows bitmap format as input. It analyzes the <b>input</b> <b>schematic</b> image for content, and produces a corresponding logical equation as output. It also provides the functionality necessary to build and maintain an image token library...|$|R
40|$|Engineering design plays {{a crucial}} role in the {{development}} of artifacts that in one way or another are linked to people's life. Traditionally the design task used to be carried out by human designers from the start to the end. In the effort to improve the efficiency of human designers, computers have been introduced to perform some of the activities. The commercially available computer design tools do not offer designers the means to start design at the concept stage. Using artificial intelligence techniques, a new software has been developed based on the system approach to provide intelligent help to mechanical engineering designers. The software allows designers to define their design framework in the form of <b>schematic</b> layouts and <b>input</b> specifications. It has the ability to evaluate the inputs from the designer and continue with the design process to the final stage. Using object oriented programming methods and production rules, suitable knowledge representation and application strategies have been developed and used to develop the software. To give the flexibility required in general design, the design component's structures are designed to exist as independent systems. They are capable of identifying their association with other components and adjust their design status according to the input and output requirements. To cope with the different requirements, the software implementation is in two phases: the concept creation which is equipped with the knowledge to capture designer's ideas and evaluate them accordingly; the embodiment design phase with the knowledge to design components to their working size and assemble them to produce the final design. A convenient user interface for the design activity has also been developed as part of the software. To demonstrate the suitability of the proposed approach on a design problem, the software model was equipped with the necessary design knowledge to design a gearbox. The software, intended for microcomputer design application was developed using the C + + programming language. It has been validated and the results showed that the proposed approach is suitable for new designs applications. Department of Marine Technology, University of Newcastle upon Tyn...|$|R
40|$|The {{landscape}} of the Transantarctic Mountains {{is the result of}} the coupled evolution of the West Antarctic rift system and the East Antarcticice sheet. Studies of this glacial-tectonic system generally assume that the evolving surface elevation of the Transantarctic Mountains is a keydeterminant of the changing East Antarctic ice-sheet dynamics between the Miocene and today. Here, we extend previous work (Huybrechts,Ph., 1993. Glaciological modeling of the Late Cenozoic East Antarctic ice sheet: stability or dynamism? Geografiska Annaler Stockholm, 75 A (4), 221 - 238) by using numerical models of the ice sheet and lithospere to examine the impact of different bedrock surface elevations ofthe Transantarctic Mountains on ice-sheet dynamics. There are widely different interpretations of the evolution of the TransantarcticMountains from the available data, so we explore bedrock surface elevations suggested by empirical evidence in recent papers about thesensitivity of the Late Cenozoic ice sheet. The results show that the surface elevation of the individual mountain blocks has only a very localeffect on ice-sheet dynamics. The existing mountain blocks of the Transantarctic Mountains, which force inland ice to drain through troughsadjacent to the mountain blocks, were overridden by inland ice when bedrock elevations were 1 km lower. When the troughs through themountains were less well developed, in the Pliocene or Miocene, inland ice was thicker and ice-surface gradients and ice-velocities across themountains were higher. This led to more active and erosive outlet glaciers through the mountains and further development of these troughs. From these results, the key determinant of East Antarctic ice dynamics appears to be the interplay between the development of major troughsthrough the Transantarctic Mountains and rising mountain elevations. The glacial history of the central Transantarctic Mountains ranges wasvery different to that of more peripheral mountain ranges, such as the Dry Valleys and Victoria Land. The development of independent icecentres in the latter regions and the overriding of these ice centres by the main ice sheet is very sensitive to the timing of surface uplift and theparticular climate profile of the period. Conversely, the ice-surface profile across the central ranges is similar under widely different climates. The limitations of such a study stem from the necessarily <b>schematic</b> bedrock elevations <b>input</b> to the model and simplifications within themodels. At present, insufficiently detailed modelling of the impact of troughs on ice-sheet dynamics means this paper is necessarilyspeculative. However, this work points to the importance of the outlet troughs on ice-sheet dynamics, rather than simply the rising surfaceelevations of the Transantarctic Mountains along the rift margin upwarp...|$|R
