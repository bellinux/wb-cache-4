25|$|Currently most Marinas on {{the lake}} don't have Automatic Identification <b>System</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{stations}} that transmit boat positions to the AIS websites for the boating community. A substantial number of vessels {{on the lake}} do not have AIS transponders as there currently are no mandatory requirements for AIS usage for this body of water. Extra precautions must be taken with respect to boating safety, as the fractal nature of the lake's hydrologic surface area can allow vessels with limited charting equipment to become easily lost.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{industry}} {{organizations and}} professional societies have published standards and best practice guidelines providing direction and guidance for control system end-users {{on how to}} establish a control system security management program. The basic premise {{that all of these}} documents share is that prevention requires a multi-layered approach, often referred to as [...] "defense-in-depth". The layers include policies and procedures, awareness and training, network segmentation, access control measures, physical security measures, system hardening, e.g., patch management, and <b>system</b> <b>monitoring,</b> anti-virus and intrusion prevention system (IPS). The standards and best practices also all recommend starting with a risk analysis and a control system security assessment.|$|E

[...] The stakeholders and the court appointed mediator, Jim Lively of the Michigan Land Use Institute, held public hearings on the new management plan for Whitefish Point on December 3, 2002. [...] Prior to receiving public comment, Lively summarized the plan by explaining that it allowed two new wings for the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum, would greatly alter the current parking areas by returning part of it to natural habitat, and would restrict people to trails. [...] The public comments at the hearing were [...] "fairly evenly matched... with the employees and board members of GLSHS supporting the plan and the residents and property owners of Whitefish Township primarily entering the official record in opposition." [...] Reasons for opposition to plan included [...] "increased foot and vehicular traffic, possible habitat loss, septic <b>system</b> <b>monitoring,</b> parking issues, building expansion, new construction, and possible contamination from lead, mercury, and other pollutants." ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{our approach to}} improve dependability of a commodity OS for embedded systems. Usually it is too difficult for end-users to resolve the problem inside a single OS, especially for embedded systems. We propose a self-healing mechanism for Linux kernel to improve the system dependability without any operations by administrators. This paper presents our white box approach for monitoring and recovering Linux kernel. Key components are a <b>system</b> <b>monitor</b> and a virtual machine <b>monitor.</b> The <b>system</b> <b>monitor</b> is used to detect the inconsistency of data structures inside Linux kernel. The virtual machine monitor provides a multi-OS environment and it isolates the <b>system</b> <b>monitor</b> from Linux kernel. In a multi-OS environment, the <b>system</b> <b>monitor</b> is able to resolve failures inside Linux kernel without stopping crucial services running on another OS. We have developed a prototype for an embedded system to verify our approach. The experiment results show that our system can remove hidden processes and reload buggy kernel modules. The performance evaluation results show that our self-healing mechanism can be used even when Linux kernel is heavily-loaded and the overhead of the <b>system</b> <b>monitor</b> is vanishingly small in actual use...|$|R
