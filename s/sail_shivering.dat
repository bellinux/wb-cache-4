60|$|The HISPANIOLA {{was under}} her main-sail and two jibs, and the {{beautiful}} white canvas shone in the sun like snow or silver. When I first sighted her, all her sails were drawing; she was lying a course about north-west, and I presumed the men on board were going round the island {{on their way back}} to the anchorage. Presently she began to fetch more and more to the westward, so that I thought they had sighted me and were going about in chase. At last, however, she fell right into the wind's eye, was taken dead aback, and stood there awhile helpless, with her <b>sails</b> <b>shivering.</b>|$|R

This was a small and brief turn to windward which would make the <b>sails</b> <b>shiver</b> and reduce the ship's speed. Just after Chesapeake began this limited turn away from Shannon, she had her means of manoeuvring entirely disabled as {{a second round of}} accurate British fire caused more losses, most critically to the men and officers manning Chesapeakes quarterdeck. Here the helmsmen were killed by a 9-pounder gun that Broke had ordered installed on the quarter deck for that very purpose, and the same gun shortly afterwards shot away the wheel itself. Surviving American gun crews did land hits on Shannon in their second round of fire, especially American carronade fire which swept Shannons forecastle, killing three men, wounding others and disabling Shannons nine pounder bow gun while one round shot demolished Shannons ship's bell.|$|R

Losing her forward momentum, she yawed further into the wind until she was in irons, her sails were pressed back against her masts and she then made sternway (went backwards). Her port stern quarter (rear left corner) made contact with Shannons starboard side, level with the fifth gunport from the bow, and Chesapeake was caught by the projecting fluke of one of Shannons anchors, which had been stowed on the gangway. Chesapeakes spanker boom then swung over the deck of the British ship. Mr Stevens, Brokes boatswain, lashed the boom inboard to keep the two ships together, and lost an arm as he did so.|$|R

60|$|She heard a dull {{detonation}} {{as if in}} {{the depth}} of the sea. It was hardly more than a shock and a vibration. A roller had broken amongst the shoals; the livid clearness Lingard had seen ahead flashed and flickered in expanded white sheets much nearer to the boat now. And all this--the wan burst of light, the faint shock as of something remote and immense falling into ruins, was taking place outside the limits of her life which remained encircled by an impenetrable darkness and by an impenetrable silence. Puffs of wind blew about her head and expired; the <b>sail</b> collapsed, <b>shivered</b> audibly, stood full and still in turn; and again the sensation of vertiginous speed and of absolute immobility succeeding each other with increasing swiftness merged at last into a bizarre state of headlong motion and profound peace. The darkness enfolded her like the enervating caress of a sombre universe. It was gentle and destructive. Its languor seduced her soul into surrender. Nothing existed and even all her memories vanished into space. She was content that nothing should exist.|$|R
60|$|This notice, from a sure hand, and {{received}} but that morning, {{had put the}} Judge to a sore dilemma; for, however indifferent to actual consistency, he was most anxious to save appearances. He could not but recollect how violent {{he had been on}} former occasions in favour of these prosecutions; and being sensible {{at the same time that}} the credit of the witnesses, though shaken in the opinion of the more judicious, was, amongst the bulk of the people out of doors, as strong as ever, he had a difficult part to play. His conduct, therefore, during the whole trial, resembled the appearance of a vessel about to go upon another tack, when her <b>sails</b> are <b>shivering</b> in the wind, ere they have yet caught the impulse which is to send her forth in a new direction. In a word, he was so uncertain which side it was his interest to favour, that he might be said on that occasion to have come nearer a state of total impartiality than he was ever capable of attaining, whether before or afterwards. This was shown by his bullying now the accused, and now the witnesses, like a mastiff too much irritated to lie still without baying, but uncertain whom he shall first bite.|$|R
60|$|During {{two years}} the brig had, in her way, as hard a life {{of it as the}} man. Swift and trim she flitted amongst the islands of little known groups. She could be descried afar from lonely headlands, a white speck {{travelling}} fast over the blue sea; the apathetic keepers of rare lighthouses dotting the great highway to the east came to know the cut of her topsails. They saw her passing east, passing west. They had faint glimpses of her flying with masts aslant in the mist of a rain-squall, or could observe her at leisure, upright and with <b>shivering</b> <b>sails,</b> forging ahead through a long day of unsteady airs. Men saw her battling with a heavy monsoon in the Bay of Bengal, lying becalmed in the Java Sea, or gliding out suddenly from behind a point of land, graceful and silent in the clear moonlight. Her activity was the subject of excited but low-toned conversations, which would be interrupted when her master appeared.|$|R
6000|$|Tilb. Alas! my gentle Nora, Thy tender youth as yet hath never mourn'd Love's fatal dart. Else wouldst thou know, {{that when}} The soul is sunk in comfortless despair, It cannot taste of merriment." [...] Dang. That's certain. [...] "Con. But see where your stern father comes It is not meet {{that he should}} find you thus." [...] Puff. Hey, what the plague!--what a cut is here! Why, what is become of the {{description}} of her first meeting with Don Whiskerandos--his gallant behaviour in the sea-fight--and the simile of the canary-bird? Tilb. Indeed, sir, you'll find {{they will not be}} missed. Puff. Very well, very well! Tilb. [To CONFIDANT.] The cue, ma'am, if you please. [...] "Con. It is not meet that he should find you thus. Tilb. Thou counsel'st right; but 'tis no easy task For barefaced grief to wear a mask of joy. Enter. GOVERNOR.. Gov. How's this!--in tears?--O Tilburina, shame! Is this a time for maudling tenderness, And Cupid's baby woes?--Hast thou not heard That haughty Spain's pope-consecrated fleet Advances to our shores, while England's fate, Like a clipp'd guinea, trembles in the scale? Tilb. Then is the crisis of my fate at hand! I see the fleets approach--I see--" [...] Puff. Now, pray, gentlemen, mind. This {{is one of the most}} useful figures we tragedy writers have, by which a hero or heroine, in consideration of their being often obliged to overlook things that are on the stage, is allowed to hear and see a number of things that are not. Sneer. Yes; a kind of poetical second-sight! Puff. Yes.--Now then, madam. [...] "Tilb. I see their decks Are clear'd!--I see the signal made! The line is form'd!--a cable's length asunder! I see the frigates station'd in the rear; And now, I hear the thunder of the guns! I hear the victor's shouts--I also hear The vanquish'd groan!--and now 'tis smoke-and now I see the loose <b>sails</b> <b>shiver</b> in the wind! I see--I see--what soon you'll see-- Gov. Hold, daughter! peace! this love hath turn'd thy brain The Spanish fleet thou canst not see--because--It is not yet in sight!" [...] Dang. Egad, though, the governor seems to make no allowance for this poetical figure you talk of. Puff. No, a plain matter-of-fact man;--that's his character. [...] "Tilb. But will you then refuse his offer? Gov. I must--I will--I can--I ought--I do. Tilb. Think what a noble price. Gov. No more--you urge in vain. Tilb. His liberty is all he asks." [...] Sneer. All who asks, Mr. Puff? Who is-- Puff. Egad, sir, I can't tell! Here has been such cutting and slashing, I don't know where they have got to myself. Tilb. Indeed, sir, you will find it will connect very well. [...] "--And your reward secure." [...] Puff. Oh, if they hadn't been so devilish free with their cutting here, you would have found that Don Whiskerandos has been tampering for his liberty, and has persuaded Tilburina to make this proposal to her father. And now, pray observe the conciseness with which the argument is conducted. Egad, the pro and con goes as smart as hits in a fencing match. It is indeed a sort of small-sword-logic, which we have borrowed from the French. [...] "Tilb. A retreat in Spain! Gov. Outlawry here! Tilb. Your daughter's prayer! Gov. Your father's oath! Tilb. My lover! Gov. My country! Tilb. Tilburina! Gov. England! Tilb. A title! Gov. Honour! Tilb. A pension! Gov. Conscience! Tilb. A thousand pounds! Gov. Ha! thou hast touch'd me nearly!" [...] Puff. There you see-she threw in Tilburina. Quick, parry Carte with England! Ha! thrust in tierce a title!--parried by honour. Ha! a pension over the arm!--put by by conscience. Then flankonade with a thousand pounds--and a palpable hit, egad! [...] "Tilb. Canst thou--Reject the suppliant, and the daughter too? Gov. No more; I would not hear thee plead in vain: The father softens--but the governor Is fix'd! [Exit.]" [...] Dang. Ay, that antithesis of persons is a most established figure. [...] "Tilb. 'Tis well,--hence then, fond hopes,--fond passion hence; Duty, behold I am all over thine-- Whisk. [Without.] Where is my love--my-- Tilb. Ha! Enter DON FEROLO WHISKERANDOS. Whisk. My beauteous enemy!--" [...] Puff. O dear, ma'am, you must start a great deal more than that! Consider, you had just determined in favour of duty--when, in a moment, the sound of his voice revives your passion-- overthrows your resolution--destroys your obedience. If you don't express all that in your start, you do nothing at all. Tilb. Well, we'll try again. Dang. Speaking from within has always a fine effect. Sneer. Very. [...] "Whisk. My conquering Tilburina! How! is't thus We meet? why are thy looks averse? what means That falling tear--that frown of boding woe? Ha! now indeed I am a prisoner! Yes, now I feel the galling weight of these Disgraceful chains--which, cruel Tilburina! Thy doting captive gloried in before.--But thou art false, and Whiskerandos is undone! Tilb. O no! how little dost thou know thy Tilburina! Whisk. Art thou then true?--Begone cares, doubts, and fears, I make you all a present to the winds; And if the winds reject you--try the waves." [...] Puff. The wind, you know, is the established receiver of all stolen sighs, and cast-off griefs and apprehensions. [...] "Tilb. Yet must we part!--stern duty seals our doom Though here I call yon conscious clouds to witness, Could I pursue the bias of my soul, All friends, all right of parents, I'd disclaim, And thou, my Whiskerandos, shouldst be father And mother, brother, cousin, uncle, aunt, And friend to me! Whisk. Oh, matchless excellence! and must we part? Well, if--we must--we must--and in that case The less is said the better." [...] Puff. Heyday! here's a cut!--What, are all the mutual protestations out? Tilb. Now, pray, sir, don't interrupt us just here: you ruin our feelings. Puff. Your feelings!--but, zounds, my feelings, ma'am! Sneer. No, pray don't interrupt them. [...] "Whisk. One last embrace. Tilb. Now,--farewell, for ever. Whisk. For ever! Tilb. Ay, for ever! [Going.]" [...] Puff. 'Sdeath and fury!--Gad's life!--sir! madam! if you go out without the parting look, you might as well dance out. Here, here! Con. But pray, sir, how am I to get off here? Puff. You! pshaw! what the devil signifies how you get off! edge away at the top, or where you will--[Pushes the CONFIDANT off.] Now, ma'am, you see-- Tilb. We understand you, sir. [...] "Ay, for ever. Both. Oh! [Turning back, and exeunt.--Scene closes.]" [...] Dang. Oh, charming! Puff. Hey!--'tis pretty well, I believe: you see I don't attempt to strike out anything new--but I take it I improve on the established modes. Sneer. You do, indeed! But pray is not Queen Elizabeth to appear? Puff. No, not once--but she is to be talked of for ever; so that, egad, you'll think a hundred times that she is on the point of coming in. Sneer. Hang it, I think it's a pity to keep her in the green-room all the night. Puff. O no, that always has a fine effect--it keeps up expectation. Dang. But are we not to have a battle? Puff. Yes, yes, you will have a battle at last: but, egad, it's not to be by land, but by sea--and that is the only quite new thing in the piece. Dang. What, Drake at the Armada, hey? Puff. Yes, i'faith--fire-ships and all; then we shall end with the procession. Hey, that will do, I think?, Sneer. No doubt on't. Puff. Come, we must not lose time; so now for the under-plot. Sneer. What the plague, have you another plot? Puff. O Lord, yes; ever while you live have two plots to your tragedy. The grand point in managing them is only to let your under-plot have as little connection with your main-plot as possible.--I flatter myself nothing can be more distinct than mine; for as in my chief plot the characters are all great people, I have laid my under-plot in low life, and as the former is to end in deep distress, I make the other end as happy as a farce.--Now, Mr. Hopkins, as soon as you please. Enter UNDER PROMPTER. Under Promp. Sir, the carpenter says it is impossible you can go to the park scene yet. Puff. The park scene! no! I mean the description scene here, in the wood. Under Promp. Sir, the performers have cut it out. Puff. Cut it out! Under Promp. Yes, sir. Puff. What! the whole account of Queen Elizabeth? Under Promp. Yes, sir. Puff. And the description of her horse and side-saddle? Under Promp. Yes, sir. Puff. So, so; this is very fine indeed!--Mr. Hopkins, how the plague could you suffer this? Mr. Hop. [Within.] Sir, indeed the pruning-knife-- Puff. The pruning-knife--zounds!--the axe! Why, here has been such lopping and topping, I shan't have the bare trunk of my play left presently!--Very well, sir--the performers must do as they please; but, upon my soul, I'll print it every word. Sneer. That I would, indeed. Puff. Very well, sir; then we must go on.--Zounds! I would not have parted with the description of the horse!--Well, sir, go on.--Sir, it was one of the finest and most laboured things.-- Very well, sir; let them go on.--There you had him and his accoutrements, from the bit to the crupper.--Very well, sir; we must go to the park scene. Under Promp. Sir, there is the point: the carpenters say, that unless there is some business put in here before the drop, they sha'n't have time to clear away the fort, or sink Gravesend and the river. Puff. So! this is a pretty dilemma, truly!--Gentlemen, you must excuse me--these fellows will never be ready, unless I go and look after them myself. Sneer. O dear, sir, these little things will happen. Puff. To cut out this scene!--but I'll print it--egad, I'll print it every word! [Exeunt.] ...|$|R
