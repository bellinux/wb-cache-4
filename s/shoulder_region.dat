In a 2007 study, Daniela Schwarz and colleagues suggested that the back dipped towards the rear. According to these researchers, the shoulder blade would have been inclined at a horizontal angle of 55–65°, much steeper than previously thought, resulting in an elevated <b>shoulder</b> <b>region.</b> With the vertebral column of the trunk and neck held in a relatively straight line, this would result in an elevated position of the head.|$|E
5|$|Like other ankylosaurids, Ankylosaurus had {{cervical}} half-rings (armor {{plates on}} the neck), {{but these are}} only known from fragments, making their exact arrangement uncertain. Carpenter suggested that when seen from above, the plates would have been paired, and created an inverted V-shape across the neck, with the midline gap probably being filled with small ossicles (round bony scutes) to allow for movement. He believed the width of this armor belt was too wide to have fitted solely on the neck, and that it covered {{the base of the}} neck and continued onto the <b>shoulder</b> <b>region.</b> Paleontologists Victoria M. Arbour and Philip J. Currie disagreed with Carpenter's interpretation, and pointed out that the cervical half-ring fragments of specimen AMNH 5895 did not fit together in the way proposed by Carpenter (though this could be due to breakage). They instead suggested that the fragments represented the remains of two cervical half-rings, which formed two semi-circular plates of armor around {{the upper part of the}} neck, as in the closely related Anodontosaurus and Euoplocephalus.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveIncreased vascularization is {{considered}} an important contributing factor for plaque vulnerability. Microvascular proliferative disease in patients with diabetes results in renal damage and visual loss. We assessed the hypothesis that vascularization in carotid atherosclerotic tissue is increased in diabetic patients, especially in the critical <b>shoulder</b> <b>regions</b> of the plaque. MethodsCarotid endarterectomy specimens, clinical data, and blood samples were collected from patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis (median 85 days after clinical event) and pharmacologic treatment for diabetes (n = 26) or no diabetes (n = 85). Plaques were fixed in formalin and transverse tissue sections prepared. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry were performed for detection of endothelial cells (anti-CD 34), macrophages (anti-CD 68), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and its receptor (VEGFR- 2). Neovascularization was assessed as CD 34 + neovessel density in the entire section area and by {{the presence or absence}} of CD 34 + vessels in the <b>shoulder</b> and cap <b>regions</b> of the plaques. ResultsThe patient groups did not differ significantly in neovascularization in the entire transverse sections (2. 0 vs 2. 1 vessels/mm 2; P =. 61) or in the fibrous cap (52 % of the patients in both groups; P =. 95). Neovascularization of the plaque <b>shoulder</b> <b>regions</b> was observed in 52 % of the diabetic patients and in 26 % of the nondiabetic patients (P =. 028). VEGF-stained areas were similar in the two patient groups (0. 4 % and 0. 2 % of shoulder area; P =. 61). Patients with diabetes had more VEGFR- 2 (1. 0 % vs 0. 2 % of shoulder area; P 90 days, 50 % of patients; P =. 002), independently of diabetes status. ConclusionsDiabetes was associated with increased vascularization of the <b>shoulder</b> <b>regions</b> in patients with symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic plaques. This was accompanied by increased expression of VEGFR- 2. The increased vascularization of the plaque <b>shoulder</b> <b>regions</b> may help explain why patients with diabetes are at increased risk of atherosclerotic complications...|$|R

25|$|The interscalene {{block is}} {{performed}} by injecting local anesthetic to the nerves of the brachial plexus {{as it passes}} through the groove between the anterior and middle scalene muscles, {{at the level of}} the cricoid cartilage. This block is particularly useful in providing anesthesia and postoperative analgesia for surgery to the clavicle, shoulder, and arm. Advantages of this block include rapid blockade of the <b>shoulder</b> <b>region,</b> and relatively easily palpable anatomical landmarks. Disadvantages of this block include inadequate anesthesia in the distribution of the ulnar nerve, which makes this an unreliable block for operations involving the forearm and hand.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the four muscles of the rotator cuff, the deltoid muscle and teres major muscles arise and exist in the <b>shoulder</b> <b>region</b> itself. The deltoid muscle covers the shoulder joint on three sides, arising from the front upper third of the clavicle, the acromion, and {{the spine of the}} scapula, and travelling to insert on the deltoid tubercle of the humerus. Contraction of each part of the deltoid assists in different movements of the shoulder - flexion (clavicular part), abduction (middle part) and extension (scapular part). The teres major attaches to the outer part {{of the back of the}} scapula, beneath the teres minor, and attaches to the upper part of the humerus. It helps with medial rotation of the humerus.|$|E

40|$|Driven by the {{significant}} advancements {{in technology and}} social issues such as security management, {{there is a strong}} need for Smart Surveillance System in our society today. One of the key features of a Smart Surveillance System is efficient human detection and counting such that the system can decide and label events on its own. In this paper we propose a new, novel and robust model, The Omega Model, for detecting and counting human beings present in the scene. The proposed model employs a set of four distinct descriptors for identifying the unique features of the head, neck and <b>shoulder</b> <b>regions</b> of a person. This unique head neck shoulder signature given by the Omega Model exploits the challenges such as inter person variations in size and shape of peoples head, neck and <b>shoulder</b> <b>regions</b> to achieve robust detection of human beings even under partial occlusion, dynamically changing background and varying illumination conditions. After experimentation we observe and analyze the influences of each of the four descriptors on the system performance and computation speed and conclude that a weight based decision making system produces the best results.

25|$|Close {{examination}} of the bones revealed that Sue was 28 {{years old at the}} time of death—the oldest T. rex known until Trix was found in 2013. A Nova episode said that the death occurred in a seasonal stream bed, which washed away some small bones. During life, this carnivore received several injuries and suffered from numerous pathologies. An injury to the right <b>shoulder</b> <b>region</b> of Sue resulted in a damaged shoulder blade, a torn tendon in the right arm due most likely from a struggle with prey, and three broken ribs. This damage subsequently healed (though one rib healed into two separate pieces), indicating Sue survived the incident. The left fibula is twice the diameter of the right one, likely the result of infection. Original reports of this broken bone were contradicted by the CT scans which showed no fracture. Multiple holes in the front of the skull were originally thought to be bite marks by some. A subsequent study found these to be areas of infection instead, possibly from an infestation of an ancestral form of Trichomonas gallinae, a protozoan parasite that infests birds and ultimately leads to death by starvation due to internal swelling of the neck. Damage to the back end of the skull was interpreted early on as a fatal bite wound. Subsequent study by Field Museum paleontologists found no bite marks. The distortion and breakage seen in some of the bones in the back of the skull was likely caused by post-mortem trampling. Some of the tail vertebrae are fused in a pattern typical of arthritis due to injury. The animal is also believed to have suffered from gout. Scholars debate exactly how the animal died; the cause of death is ultimately unknown.|$|E
25|$|The forest wildcat's fur {{is fairly}} uniform in length {{throughout}} the body. The {{hair on the}} tail is very long and dense, thus making it look furry and thick. In winter, the guard hairs measure 7cm, the tip hairs 5.5–6cm, and the underfur 4.5–5.5cm. Corresponding measurements in the summer are 5–6.7cm, 4.5–6cm, and 5.3cm. In winter, the forest wildcat's main coat colour is fairly light gray, becoming richer along the back, and fading onto the flanks. A slight ochreous shade is visible on the undersides of the flanks. A black and narrow dorsal band starts on the shoulders, and runs along the back, usually terminating {{at the base of}} the tail. Indistinct black smudges are present around the dorsal band, which may form a transverse striping pattern on rare occasions. The undersurface of the body is very light gray, with a light ochreous tinge. One or more white spots may occur on rare occasions on the throat, between the forelegs, or in the inguinal region. The tail is the same colour as the back, with the addition of a pure black tip. 2–3 black, transverse rings occur above the tail tip. The dorsal surface of the neck and head are the same colour as that of the trunk, but is lighter gray around the eyes, lips, cheeks, and chin. The top of the head and the forehead bear four well-developed dark bands. These bands sometimes split into small spots which extend to the neck. Two short and narrow stripes are usually present in the <b>shoulder</b> <b>region,</b> in front of the dorsal band. A dark and narrow stripe is present on the outer corner of the eye, under the ear. This stripe may extend into the neck. Another such stripe occurs under the eye, which also extends into the neck. The wildcat's summer coat has a fairly light, pure background colour, with an admixture of ochre or brown. In some animals, the summer coat is ashen coloured. The patterns on the head and neck are as well-developed as those on the tail, though the patterns on the flanks are almost imperceptible.|$|E
500|$|S.nicholsi from Puerto Rico is both bulkier {{and larger}} than the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero, {{measuring}} [...] from snout to vent. It also differs {{in the size of}} its dorsal scales, which is reflected in scale count comparisons. S.nicholsi has 19 to 24 dorsal scales from axilla to groin, whereas S.parthenopion has 30 to 35. Also, S.nicholsi has only 34 to 42 scales around the midbody compared to 50 to 55 in S.parthenopion, and its ventral scales from axilla to groin range from 21 to 26, which is still less than 26 to 29 in S.parthenopion. S.nicholsi typically has one internasal scale versus the two more commonly seen in S.parthenopion. The escutcheons are also larger in male S.nicholsi, on average. In terms of colouration, both species are very similar, but S.nicholsi usually has a crescent-shaped pattern on its head that touches the postocular stripes, instead of an oval-shaped pattern {{that may or may not}} reach the stripes. Also, its postocular stripes run the length of its body and tail instead of ending on the neck. The dorsolateral stripes of S.nicholsi converge to make a dark-edged U- or Y-shaped pattern in the sacral (pelvic) region. The majority of S.nicholsi have a pattern on the scapular (<b>shoulder)</b> <b>region</b> consisting of two small pale dots encompassed by small regions of black.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Correlation {{coefficients}} between {{abdominal fat}} and two skin measurements {{were obtained from}} 314 male and 347 female broiler chickens (Gallus gallus domesticus). Wing web thicknesses were measured at 49 days of age, broilers were slaughtered at 50 days of age, and humeral feather tract pinches were measured after thawing but before evisceration. Correlation coefficients between wing web thickness and abdominal fat weight were r = +. 14 for males and r = +. 05 for females. Correlations for humeral tract pinch with abdominal fat weight were r = +. 12 and +. 17 (males) and r = +. 18 and +. 13 (females) for tracts on left and right <b>shoulder</b> <b>regions,</b> respectively. Abdominal fat was expressed as precentage of live weight to reduce variation in weight between birds.

40|$|Occupational {{tasks of}} linemen are highly {{associated}} {{with the development of}} work related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMDs). Although linemen are prone to develop WRMDs, there is paucity of information on the prevalence of WRMDs and related occupational causative factors. Therefore, the present review was conducted to report on the prevalence of WRMDs and to outline causative risk factors within occupational tasks in the lineman profession. Literature search was conducted in various databases such as Scopus, PubMed and ScienceDirect for articles published between 1996 – 2013. The articles were analyzed, selected and retrieved based on predetermined objectives, inclusion criteria and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). In the review process only articles published in English were considered. The review identified moderate to high prevalence of WRMDs among the linemen population. Back and <b>shoulder</b> <b>regions</b> were highly affected compared to the other body regions. The review also reported occupational tasks such as bar installation, insulator fixation and manual handling of tools as high risk tasks that lead to the development of WRMDs. In addition, occupational tools such as ladders, manual cutters and manual presses were also identified as a potential ergonomic hazard. In conclusion, the current review identified that WRMDs are common in the back and <b>shoulder</b> <b>regions</b> among linemen. Also, a number of occupational risk factors were identified to be associated with WRMDs among the linemen. Hence, future research on prevention and intervention studies concerning lineman profession population in order to develop a good job practice are recommended.
