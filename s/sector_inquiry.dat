5000|$|A special {{instrument}} of the European Commission is the so-called <b>sector</b> <b>inquiry</b> in accordance with Art. 17 of Regulation 1/2003. Article 17 (1) first paragraph of Council Regulation 1/2003 reads: ...|$|E
5000|$|Traditionally, {{agreements}} had, {{subject to}} certain exceptions, {{to be notified}} to the European Commission, and the Commission had a monopoly over the application of Article 101 TFEU (former Article 81 (3) EG). Because the European Commission {{did not have the}} resources to deal with all the agreements notified, notification was abolished. One of the most spectacular <b>sector</b> <b>inquiry</b> was the pharmaceutical <b>sector</b> <b>inquiry</b> which took place in 2008 and 2009 in which the European Commission used dawn raids from the beginning. The European Commission launched a <b>sector</b> <b>inquiry</b> into EU pharmaceuticals markets under the European Competition rules because information relating to innovative and generic medicines suggested that competition may be restricted or distorted. The inquiry related to the period 2000 to 2007 and involved investigation of a sample of 219 medicines. [...] Taking into account that sector inquiries are a tool under European Competition law, the inquiry´s main focus was company behaviour. The inquiry therefore concentrated on those practices which companies may use to block or delay generic competition as well as to block or delay the development of competing originator drugs.|$|E

50|$|Creation of ENTSO-E was {{initiated}} by {{the adoption of the}} European Union third legislative package on the gas and electricity markets. In 2003, the European Commission conducted a <b>sector</b> <b>inquiry</b> concerning the competition of electricity market in six European countries. Examining competition in these countries, the final report stated serious issues to be solved. It was noticed that the integration between member state's markets is still insufficient. Additionally, the absence of transparently available market information was assessed. As a result, the third legislative package on the EU gas and electricity markets was adopted by the European Commission in September 2007.|$|E
50|$|In case of sector inquiries, the European Commission follows its {{reasonable}} {{suspicion that}} the competition in a particular industry sector or solely related to {{a certain type of}} contract which is used in various industry sectors is prevented, restricted or distorted within the common market. Thus, in this case not a specific violation is investigated. Nevertheless, the European Commission has almost all avenues of investigation at its disposal, which it may use to investigate and track down violations of competition law. The European Commission may decide to start a <b>sector</b> <b>inquiry</b> when a market {{does not seem to be}} working as well as it should. This might be suggested by evidence such as limited trade between Member States, lack of new entrants on the market, the rigidity of prices, or other circumstances suggest that competition may be restricted or distorted within the common market. In the course of the inquiry, the Commission may request that firms - undertakings or associations of undertakings - concerned supply information (for example, price information). This information is used by the European Commission to assess whether it needs to open specific investigations into intervene to ensure the respect of EU rules on restrictive agreements and abuse of dominant position (Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union).|$|E

This article summarises the findings and the conclusions of both sector inquiries and describes the methodology used by the two authorities. After several years since the beginning of both liberalisation processes in both sectors, the AGCM and the AEEG find that Italian electricity and natural gas markets still lack competitiveness and are characterised by the presence of a dominant operator, ENEL (in the electricity sector) and ENI (in the natural gas sector).

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the outcome of}} recent inquiries into mass-marketed tax effective investment schemes in Australia within the broader context of promoting ecologically sustainable development in the agribusiness <b>sector.</b> The recent <b>inquiries</b> have revealed some significant shortcomings {{in the application of}} the self-assessment system to agribusiness investors, which have to some extent been remedied by the introduction of product rulings. Whilst product rulings have provided investors with a certain degree of security, there has been a significant decline in agribusiness investment and a convergence in the range of agribusiness ventures being offered. The author concludes that the income tax system is currently providing the wrong market signals, by promoting many agribusiness investment schemes that are not ecologically sustainable. Accordingly, there is a strong case for ecological tax reform, whereby the taxation treatment of agribusiness investment schemes needs to be better integrated with environmental policy...|$|R

40|$|In its Pharmaceutical <b>Sector</b> <b>Inquiry</b> Report of 2009, the European Commission {{identified}} ‘defensive patent strategies’ as {{a potential}} anti-competitive abuse {{in the sense of}} Article 102 TFEU. Such strategies include in particular patent filings that may delay the market entry of generic drugs or obstruct innovation activity of other originator companies. Yet the Report refrains from a an in-depth legal analysis of such behaviour. With the objective of clarifying the legal implications of the <b>Sector</b> <b>Inquiry</b> Report, the article analyses the AstraZeneca judgment of the General Court of 2010 as a precedent for assessing the anti-competitive character of patent filings under EU competition law. Thereby, it is argued that patent law does not insulate filings against competition-law liability. Yet the judgment, which is limited to ‘static’ price competition between originator companies and generics producers, does not provide sufficient guidance for analysing harm to ‘dynamic’ competition in innovation among originator companies. In this regard, the article advocates a cautious approach, according to which a violation of EU competition law requires anti-competitive intent for which the party arguing a violation should carry the burden of proof. The article also refers to the Boehringer case, which was settled by the Commission in Summer 2011, after Boehringer agreed to give up its allegedly anti-competitive blocking patents...|$|E

The Commission argues that making the European gas market more competitive (completing the internal gas market) will be instrumental in the pursuit of these objectives. We examine the question through the eyes of existing models of the European gas market. Can model tell us anything on this problem? Do they confirm or infirm the analysis of the Commission appearing in fundamental documents such the Green Paper, the <b>Sector</b> <b>Inquiry</b> or the new legislation package? We argue that results of existing models contradict a fundamental finding (paragraph 77) of the <b>Sector</b> <b>Inquiry.</b> We further elaborate {{on the basis of the}} economic assumption underlying the models, that changing the assumptions implicitly contained in paragraph 77 cast doubts on a large part of the reasoning justifying the completion of the internal gas market.

40|$|The Irish {{construction}} industry has undergone substantial {{change in the}} past decade. Following a deep, lengthy recession the improving outlook of the construction <b>sector</b> makes the <b>inquiry</b> into strategy within the firms both timely and appropriate.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} has been to investigate how teachers in Vocational Education and Training (VET) in Australia deal with the Double Heuristic Method (DHM) as an alternative model for teaching in the VET Sector. The context is set within a vocational educational landscape globally, highlighting approaches {{in the delivery of}} vocational education in the USA, European countries and Australia. In pursuit of these approaches, various typologies of competency-based training (CBT) are explored. The VET systems around the world have been undergoing a period of continuous reform, moving VET systems towards a more holistic approach of teaching and learning in higher education. In such a context, the Australian VET sector has been and continues to be faced with challenges in the implementation of the Australian Training Packages, the core curriculum for the VET <b>sector.</b> This <b>inquiry</b> has been implemented within an interpretive paradigm in seeking to capture teachers’ perspectives of using the DHM and to investigate how VET teachers deal with the pedagogical challenges in their work. Central to the research question is investigating how teachers deal with an alternative model of pedagogy, the Double Heuristic Model, from their own frames of reference, and as they experience it. Qualitative methods have been used for data collection and analysis. The primary source of data was a series of semi-structured interviews. The data analysis was based on the principles of grounded theory method as outlined in the work of Strauss and Corbin (1990) whereby participants are placed in a position to consider a phenomenon and how they make meaning of that phenomena. In pursuing this approach to methodology in the two years of data collection and analysis, all three types of coding were utilised: open coding, axial coding and selective coding (Strauss and Corbin, 1990). As the Double Heuristic Method is a relatively new approach in vocational education in Australia, there has not been any prior research on its use in this area. Hence, {{this research}} contributes to developing new insights into teachers’ perspectives and responses to one approach in teaching the Units of Competency in the Training Packages in Australia, using an alternative pedagogical framework.

40|$|In this thesis, early {{estimates}} of turnover of trade published by Statistics Finland are constructed {{in order to}} make forecasts more accurate and available earlier than they currently are. The term for making early estimates is called nowcasting, and it comes from words now and forecasting. The idea is to use information which is published early and possibly at higher frequencies to obtain early estimates before the official information is published. This subject is important because policymakers and researchers follow forecasts when making decisions about fiscal and monetary policies or testing economic models. Also central banks, public and private entities and statistical agencies collect a vast amount of economic data every year. The lags of current forecasts can be quite long; the lags of Statistics Finland’s turnover of trade is 45 days and 75 days. The data used in this work for nowcasting is sales inquiry, consumer survey and first registrations of motor vehicles collected by Statistics Finland and retail trade’s confidence indicator published by Confederation of Finnish Industries. The nowcasting target, the turnover of trade, is divided to four activities, which are estimated separately: total trade, wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles (vehicles), wholesale trade and retail trade. The methods used in this thesis are dynamic factor model, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, ridge regression and elastic net. These models in question are chosen {{by the fact that they}} try to avoid the problem of overparameterization, which is the case with the data used in this thesis. The nowcasts are made using sales <b>inquiry</b> including all <b>sectors,</b> sales <b>inquiry</b> including only trade <b>sector,</b> sales <b>inquiry</b> including consumer survey balance figure about own economic situation now, when nowcasting target is retail trade, and sales inquiry including first registrations of motor vehicles data, when nowcasting target is vehicles. The estimation period starts from January 2010 and ends in December 2016 and the time series are from January 2000 to December 2016. The estimations are made for four time lags: t+ 5, t+ 10, t+ 20 and t+ 26. That is, the sales inquiry used for nowcasting is tested after accumulating 5, 10, 20 and 26 days from the beginning of each month. Every time lag is tested with the four models used in this thesis. The nowcasting results are compared to actual values of every activity using mean absolute error and a naïve ARIMA-forecasts are used as benchmarks. Before consumer survey data and first registrations are added in the models, their prediction power is tested using ARIMA-forecasts. The results showed that sales <b>inquiry</b> including all <b>sectors</b> gave better estimations than sales inquiry including only trade. Nowcasts made from sales <b>inquiry</b> including all <b>sectors</b> gave good results when estimating retail trade, somewhat good results when predicting total trade and wholesale trade and worse results when nowcasting vehicles. Consumer survey’s question about own economic situation now did not outperform the sales inquiry estimations when the target is retail trade and when forecasted with ARIMA-model one step ahead. When the consumer survey data was added to the nowcasting models, the results did not improve. First registrations of motor vehicles with vehicles series outperformed the sales inquiry nowcasting results, when forecasted with ARIMA-model one step ahead. The results were quite similar and only slightly better than with sales inquiry data only, when first registrations of motor vehicles was added in the nowcasting models. Retail trade’s confidence indicator published by Confederation of Finnish Industries was left out of further examination, because it did not perform as well as consumer survey. Retail trade nowcast results gave mean absolute errors under 1 % at time lags t+ 20 and t+ 26 using elastic net method. There is not much difference between t+ 20 and t+ 26 and the time lag t+ 20 seems appropriate for making nowcasts. Consumer survey data did not improve these results, and therefore it can be left out from the nowcasting models. Nowcasting results for vehicles gave the highest mean absolute errors and adding the first registrations data in the models did not significantly improve the results. Other data sources could be considered adding to the models. Nowcasting results from total trade and wholesale trade gave 1 %- 2 % mean absolute errors, but they were not examined with additional data sources. Sales <b>inquiry</b> including all <b>sectors</b> seemed appropriate for nowcasting retail trade, but total trade, wholesale trade and vehicles need more examination...|$|R

Recent numbers reflect a 16 % representation by women in the total Armed Forces population, with the Air Force displaying the largest proportion (17 %), while the Marine Corps has the smallest proportion (6 %). Multiple Defense organizations have {{expressed concern about the}} progression of women officers into senior leadership positions and the barriers they face to their continued success in the military. This thesis explores the officer career path experienced by women officers progressing through the ranks, primarily during the mid-level grades of Captain (O- 3) through Lt Colonel (O- 5). It specifically examines women in the United States Marine Corps and Air Force because these two branches of service currently maintain the smallest and largest proportion of women, respectively.

40|$|Issuing {{the final}} report on its energy <b>sector</b> <b>inquiry,</b> the European Commission pointed {{to a range of}} {{competition}} concerns across the EU energy sector, including a lack of integration and transparency. In particular, however, the Commission identified the high degree of vertical integration in energy markets as an obstacle to competition. The Commission?s suggested remedy is the separation of ownership and/or operation of gas and electricity transmission networks from other energy supply activities; the ?unbundling? of transmission and other activities that control market access. While the Commission strongly favours full ownership unbundling, other possible models are under consideration. Unbundling faces considerable political opposition from a number of Member States. Even if the Commission is successful in its objective of securing unbundling, it will be some time before the necessary legislation takes effect. Meanwhile, however, the Commission has been pursuing a number of investigations into individual energy companies. A key theme of those investigations has been the alleged abuse of transmission network activities in order to restrict competition on energy supply markets. Practices under investigation by the Commission include ?strategic under-investment? in network infrastructure. Remedies under consideration include the divestment of network activities. Any such remedy is likely to take effect ahead of legislative unbundling. Ordering unbundling as a remedy in individual competition cases would be a development for which there is little precedent. This raises the question whether the Commission has demanded concessions which it would not have done in the absence of wider concerns about the energy sector, or whether its work on the <b>sector</b> <b>inquiry</b> has simply provided it with {{a deeper understanding of the}} issues. There are also questions about the power of the Commission to order such divestment remedies. This article examines the background and the issues...|$|E

40|$|The Application of Anti-Manipulation Law to EU Wholesale Energy Markets and Its Interplay with EU Competition Law Of the findings, the European Commission {{established}} {{in its report}} on Energy <b>Sector</b> <b>Inquiry,</b> market manipulation constituted a major concern for the functioning and integrity of EU energy sectors. The Commission argued that the responsibility for high prices in wholesale energy markets {{could be attributed to}} manipulative practices of energy incumbents and the trust in the operation of operation of sector was largely compromised, due to these practices. Remedies, EU competition law provided, were considered as insufficient to resolve these shortcomings and thus should be supplemented with regulatory-based tools. The findings of the Energy <b>Sector</b> <b>Inquiry</b> and subsequent consultation documents by multiple EU institutions {{paved the way for the}} adoption of the Regulation on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency, REMIT, which incorporated into an anti-manipulation rule, specifically designed to prohibit and prosecute manipulative practices in EU wholesale energy markets. Nevertheless, as EU case law on market manipulation has yet to develop and there are uncertainties with respect to the concept of market manipulation. Furthermore REMIT does not preclude the jurisdiction of EU competition law, questions arise as to the scope and the extent of the application of this prohibition. Throughout its chapters, this book explores the scope of and the case law on market manipulation to determine what types of market practices are regarded as manipulative and thus prohibited under anti-manipulation rules. It also focuses on the interplay between REMIT and EU competition law and evaluates factors and circumstances that determine when and what market misconduct can be subject to enforcement proceedings under both anti-manipulation and antitrust rules. As the development of a single, coherent, rulebook that can be relied upon by market participant is fundamental for the functioning of EU wholesale energy markets, the book, finally, provides proposals and measures that can mitigate and resolve the legal uncertainties regarding the regulatory framework REMIT established...|$|E
40|$|The "Major Permorming Arts Inquiry" {{conducted}} by Helen Nugent (known as the Nugent report) reviewed 31 major performing arts organisations and arose {{out of a}} perceived crisis in the sector due to the adverse impacts of globalisation, technological change and demographic shifts on their viability: in short, costs were spiralling while revenue was declining. The inquiry conducted a comprehensive dissection of the sector employing a business model {{as well as a}} review of the organisations’ performance in terms of training, administration and repertoire. The report argued that the major performing arts companies made ‘an enormous artistic and financial contribution to Australian life’ and that the implementation of these recommendations would ‘stabilise’ and ‘reposition’ the sector and thereby ‘secure [its] artistic vitality, accessibility and financial viability’. The underlying principles of the report were that: Australia should have a vibrant major performing arts sector that enriches Australian life and builds its image as an innovative and sophisticated nation; that Australia should cost-effectively deliver broad access to the major performing arts — recognising that the arts are for everyone; an that Australia should have a financially viable major performing arts sector that supports artistic vibrancy. Equally, however, the report endorsed the view that government support should be ‘transparent and should be based on an understanding of the responsibilities of all parties’. The report’s 95 recommendations were accepted by government and an extra $ 70 million was injected into the sector by federal and state governments, administered by DCITA and the MPAB of the Australia Council. The recommendations were designed to create a cohesive structure for the industry and included: Classifying companies into Global, Australian Flagship, Niche and Regional Flagship depending on the strategic role played by each. Introducing a five step funding model that reflects the cost of each artform, each company’s strategic role and the commitment to geographic access. Ensuring a commitment to invest in new works, new productions and improved quality of performance to increase box office receipts and build a differentiated image of Australia. Strengthening private sector support. Engaging in collaborations, cooperation and co-productions between companies within artforms. Exploring a ‘community of musicians’ concept between orchestras. Strengthening marketing and development capacity. Introducing rolling triennial funding. Improving accountability and reporting practices. Adopting a reserves policy. Changing the financial dynamics of companies in each artform. Despite the introduction of the majority of these changes, the overall wellbeing of the major performing arts companies has not markedly improved, as an Australia Council review by the Major Performing Arts Board concluded in 2004. Because of the perceived bias towards protecting the major artform companies, other sectors lobbied for similar reviews and funding increases. The Nugent Report became the first of the so-called ‘Review Cycle’ into arts <b>sectors</b> with <b>inquiries</b> into the small-to-medium performing arts sector, visual arts and crafts, symphony orchestras, new media and dance to follow.    ...|$|R
40|$|Maximising {{employee}} wellbeing is {{a challenge}} for managers at any time. The current economic climate of austerity and the resulting financial constraints within the public sector increase this challenge. Promoting happiness in the workplace is potentially relevant to improving productivity, creativity and retention of staff. Previous research on happiness in the workplace has focused on job satisfaction and employee engagement however happiness in the workplace is an understudied area and offers an incomplete understanding of the phenomenon. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop, in collaboration with staff, a workplace which facilitates staff happiness at work. Concept analyses of happiness and happiness in the workplace were conducted in order to provide a conceptual framework for the study. Self-determination theory is proposed as a theoretical explanation for happiness in the workplace. Review of workplace happiness research highlighted an incomplete account of happiness in the workplace. The study was conducted in a School of Nursing in the university <b>sector.</b> An Appreciative <b>Inquiry</b> (AI) approach underpinned by a social constructionist philosophy was adopted. AI is an affirmative, collaborative, action focused and generative approach involving four stages of Discovery, Dream, Design and Destiny. All full time staff (n= 80) of the School were invited to participate. A total of twenty three staff across roles and disciplines chose to participate in the study. Focus group and individual interviews were used to collect data during each of the stages. Template Analysis was used to inductively identify School strengths consistent with participants’ understandings of happiness in the workplace. Self-determination, Fulfilment and Community were found to be central to Being Happy in this workplace in the Discovery phase. On the basis of these shared meanings of happiness in the workplace, vision statements and an action plan were subsequently developed in the Dream and Design phases of the study. Actions developed by participants were then implemented and some are ongoing, as is the nature of action focused research. During this Destiny phase of the study an evaluation was conducted to identify change as a result of the process and to further identify participants’ experience of the AI process. In addition to observable outcomes in the workplace arising from the action plan, changed thinking and changed behaviour of participants, in line with achieving happiness in the workplace, were identified. Findings have implications for management practice and support the relevance of Self Determination Theory to the facilitation of happiness in the workplace. In addition findings indicat...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{a body of}} data emanating from the 2008 / 2009 EU Pharmaceutical <b>Sector</b> <b>Inquiry,</b> interpreting the collection of submissions {{to it as a}} concerted attempt at market innovation that becomes fraught with challenge and contest. In the pharmaceutical market, interests associated with patient concerns, government budgets, global “Big Pharma,” and local “small pharma” coalesce and compete with patent law, technological innovation and drug lifecycles. Our research question is: What role do market narratives play in shaping the market's socio-technical agencements? By introducing market narratives, we focus on the performative effects of temporality and iteration. Our argument is that by acting as (contested) promissories, market narratives contribute to “agencing” a market, such that actors are engaged continually in juxtaposing and adjusting their representations of it and putting in place those socio-technical agencements that make the markets resemble those narratives. Narrating a market becomes a collective and iterative task of equipping actors to shape the markets that they desire...|$|E
