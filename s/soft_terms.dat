Our method consists of three main steps: creating a similarity score between entries, grouping entries together into `unique entities', and refining the groups. We compare various methods for creating similarity scores, considering different combinations of string matching, term frequency-inverse document frequency methods, and n-gram techniques. In particular, we introduce a vectorized <b>soft</b> <b>term</b> frequency-inverse document frequency method, with an optional refinement step.

We first motivate the particle content of the theory by examining the quantum numbers of the known standard model particles and by the requirement of anomaly cancellation. Once the particle content is fixed we can write down the most general renormalizable superpotential. However such a superpotential will contain terms breaking lepton and baryon number which leads us {{to the concept of}} R-parity conservation. The question of supersymmetry breaking is discussed next. We list the possible <b>soft</b> breaking <b>terms.</b> However the Lagrangian involving the most general <b>soft</b> breaking <b>terms</b> is phenomenologically intractable because of the appearance of the many new parameters.

We motivate the need for universal <b>soft</b> breaking <b>terms</b> by the apparent unification of gauge couplings in the MSSM and by the absence of flavor changing neutral currents. Then we discuss radiative electroweak symmetry breaking. Radiative breaking arises because the one loop corrections involving the large top Yukawa coupling change the sign of the soft breaking mass parameter of the up-type Higgs doublet, this way introducing a nontrivial minimum in the Higgs potential. Finally we give an overview of the possible mixings in the MSSM and enumerate the physical (mass eigenstate) fields together with the mass matrices.
