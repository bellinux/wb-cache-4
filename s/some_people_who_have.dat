5|$|According to surveys, the {{addition}} to a prescribed SSRI is a common strategy when people {{do not respond to}} the SSRI, even though this is not an officially approved indication. The addition of bupropion to an SSRI (most commonly fluoxetine or sertraline) may result in an improvement in <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> an incomplete response to the first-line antidepressant.|$|E
25|$|The varicoceles {{might be}} noticed as soft lumps, usually above the {{testicle}} and {{mostly on the}} left side of the scrotum. Right-sided and bilateral varicoceles do also occur. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> them feel pain or heaviness in their scrotum. Varicoceles are sometimes discovered when investigating the cause of male infertility.|$|E
25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been {{infected}} with TB {{may have a}} negative reaction when tested years after infection, as the immune system response may gradually wane. This initial skin test, though negative, may stimulate (boost) the body's ability to react to tuberculin in future tests. Thus, a positive reaction to a subsequent test may be misinterpreted as a new infection, when {{in fact it is}} the result of the boosted reaction to an old infection.|$|E

25|$|<b>Some</b> <b>people,</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> paid {{attention}} to the governmental regulation on the Internet, mentioned another aspect of the ruling. April Glaser, a staff activist at the EFF, noted that the ruling had an aspect of a bar against the FCC's approach to network neutrality. Various commentators pointed to the possibility that by invoking the court's interpretation of Section 706, the FCC could expand its regulative power to the Internet thereby threatening its freedom.|$|E
25|$|The lack {{of celebrity}} was symbolised in earlier series by the {{presence}} of a minor, and often somewhat cult, celebrity, locked up in a cage in the dungeon of the Bungalow. In later series, the celebrity would sit in the attic. In both cases they would say nothing and often do nothing. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been in the cage or the attic included Vince Earl, Sarah Greene, John Kettley, Hugo Myatt (as Treguard from Knightmare), Su Pollard, Bodger and Badger, and Peter Simon.|$|E
25|$|Herd {{immunity}} also decreases risk {{to people}} who have a compromised immune system. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> a compromised immune system cannot get certain vaccines and thus are at increased risk if those around them are not vaccinated for those diseases. If the immunocompromised person is surrounded by people who have not been vaccinated and have the disease, that person will likely contract the disease. The outcome for people with compromised immune systems who subsequently get infected is often worse than that of the general population. Herd immunity decreases this risk.|$|E

500|$|In April 2004, Clarkson {{entered the}} studio {{immediately}} after the Independent Tour. She said in an interview, [...] "I've written most of (the songs) so far, but there's <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> some stuff for me. I'm {{not one of those}} people who thinks you have to write everything. (I'll sing it) as long as I can relate to it." [...] During the album's development, Davis revealed that he was reluctant to let Clarkson write material for the album. He revealed, [...] "I always encourage people to write their own songs, but in the pop arena, where the career is totally dependent on hits, you get skeptical. Artists with great voices like Melissa Manchester and Taylor Dayne could have had much longer careers if they didn't insist on writing their own material." [...] Clarkson reiterates that she's been writing songs since her teens, but rather than argue over labels or abilities, the two reached a détente—she would co-write half the album, with the other half being penned by other songwriters and producers. She said, [...] "I just think it's funny that all these middle-age guys told me, 'You don't know how a pop song needs to sound.' I'm a 23-year-old girl! But I was fighting those battles alone." [...] In February 2004, Clarkson met with musicians Ben Moody and David Hodges, who had just departed from their band Evanescence in late 2003. She said, [...] "I didn't know that he (Moody) wasn't with Evanescence anymore," [...] Clarkson said. [...] "I just really liked their vibe and I thought it might be cool to work with one of them. So I just randomly asked people I work with, 'Hey, do you think that he'd work with me?' And then I found out that he kind of split and that's what he's doing... so it worked out perfectly." [...] Moody recalled, [...] "It's cool because she wants to do some branching out, and I'm doing nothing but branching out, we got together and she had all these songs in mind of what she wanted to do. It's just a really, really cool process for me, because everybody is a new experience. Everybody works differently." ...|$|E

In an interview with BBC Three, Gamergate supporter John Bain, known by his YouTube moniker [...] "TotalBiscuit," [...] said he has been the target of death threats and harassment from anonymous people who opposed his view on Gamergate. Mike Diver wrote in Vice that threats against Gamergate supporters had been neglected in press coverage. Misogynist abuse and vitriolic messages were targeted at many people involved.|$|E
50|$|The process {{began with}} a dispute between the Lord of Urtubi and <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> accused him and his men of being witches.

They made one attempt to stop us near Paris; fortunately that failed, or we should not be now enjoying your society; but as it was likely that another attempt would be made upon the road, we thought it better to leave it altogether and take to the forest for the night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The man's name is William Barens.

He always puts his papers away at night in his safe, so [...] that his table can be properly dusted.

6000|$|In {{that matter}} {{at least the}} cold-blooded {{stranger}} begins at last to imitate him; begins to lead a life that shall be before all things easy; unless indeed he allow himself, like Mr. Ruskin, to be put out of humour by Titian and Tiepolo. The hours he spends among the pictures are his best hours in Venice, and I am ashamed to have written so much of common things when I might have been making festoons {{of the names of}} the masters. Only, when we have covered our page with such festoons what more is left to say? When one has said Carpaccio and Bellini, the Tintoret and the Veronese, one has struck a note that must be left to resound at will. Everything has been said about the mighty painters, and it is of little importance that a pilgrim the more has found them to his taste. [...] "Went this morning to the Academy; was very much pleased with Titian's 'Assumption.'" [...] That honest phrase has doubtless been written in many a traveller's diary, and was not indiscreet on the part of its author. But it appeals little to the general reader, and we must moreover notoriously not expose our deepest feelings. Since I have mentioned Titian's [...] "Assumption" [...] I must say that there are <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been less pleased with it than the observer we have just imagined. It is one of the possible disappointments of Venice, and you may if you like take advantage of your privilege of not caring for it. It imparts a look of great richness {{to the side of the}} beautiful room of the Academy on which it hangs; but the same room contains two or three works less known to fame which are equally capable of inspiring a passion. [...] "The 'Annunciation' struck me as coarse and superficial": that note was once made in a simple-minded tourist's book. At Venice, strange to say, Titian is altogether a disappointment; the city of his adoption is far from containing the best of him. Madrid, Paris, London, Florence, Dresden, Munich --these are the homes of his greatness.|$|E
50|$|There were {{multiple}} {{reports of}} Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), a paralyzing neuromuscular disorder, affecting <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>had</b> received swine flu immunizations.

Guillain-Barré syndrome naturally occurs at a rate of 6-40 per million people per year, implying an increased risk of between 2.5%-25% over the base rate.|$|R
