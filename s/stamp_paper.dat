25|$|The {{purpose of}} {{grilling}} was {{to permit the}} canceling ink to be better absorbed into the <b>stamp</b> <b>paper,</b> thus preventing reuse of stamps by washing out the cancellation marks. The use of grills {{was found to be}} impractical and they were gradually discontinued after 1870.|$|E
25|$|Watermarks {{occur in}} paper and are {{made during the}} paper making process by means of various devices that impart an {{impression}} in the wet paper pulp, the impression usually consisting of an official emblem or letter(s). The actual watermark portion of the paper is thinner than the surrounding paper. The difference in paper thickness can usually be detected by holding the stamp up to a light, however some countries have issued stamps whose watermarks {{are very difficult to}} detect in this manner and require watermark detection fluid. Watermarks were originally used by governments for documents, currency and other applications to help prevent counterfeiting. The U.S. Post office began using a double-line watermark bearing the initials USPS in 1895, when the Bureau of Engraving and Printing introduced it into the previously unwatermarked Bureau Triangles stamp issues. The same double-line watermark paper used then was used on the various issues leading up to and used in the production of the 1908 and 1909 versions of the Washington-Franklin issues. In 1910 the watermark was changed to a single-line watermark and with initials which were smaller in size, partly because the double-line watermark tended to weaken the sheets at the perforations causing premature separation of stamps at the Post Office, and partly because postal officials suspected that the double-line watermark caused the <b>stamp</b> <b>paper</b> to shrink unevenly when the sheets dried after printing.|$|E

And then there was the vast lot of <b>stamp</b> <b>paper</b> on the window. And then, most of all, there were the two things the young lady said--things that couldn't be true. Don't get annoyed," [...] he added hastily, noting a sudden movement of the Scotchman's head; [...] "she thought they were true. A person can't be quite alone in a street a second before she receives a letter. She can't be quite alone in a street when she starts reading a letter just received. There must be somebody pretty near her; he must be mentally invisible." ...|$|E
