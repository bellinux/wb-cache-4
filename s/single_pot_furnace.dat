40|$|LKAB {{is a state}} owned, Swedish {{mining company}} that {{produces}} iron ore products for the steel making industries, mainly iron ore pellets. The final process of heat treating iron ore pellets, which is done in a Grate-kiln, is the most energy consuming part of the refining process. This {{has led to a}} collaboration between LKAB and the Division of Energy Technology at Chalmers to make the Grate-kiln more energy efficient. With help from an in-house simulation model by LKAB, earlier work within this collaboration has suggested process changes that makes this process more energy efficient. The simulation model describes the heat and mas transfer through the whole Grate-kiln process. The simulation model is believed to perform well under standard running condition, but has difficulty to evaluate the process when large changes are made in the running settings. Therefore, this work has been to validate the simulation model against an experimental test rig, so called <b>pot</b> <b>furnace,</b> where it was the grate performance from the Grate-kiln that was analysed. Measurements were taken from the <b>pot</b> <b>furnace</b> and compared with the calculations from the simulation program. The key parameters and processes used for comparison were the temperatures, the degree of oxidation, the drying process and the pressure drop. The outcome from this study has shown that the results from the simulation model regarding the oxidization process correlate with the measured results from the <b>pot</b> <b>furnace.</b> Temperature measurements from the <b>pot</b> <b>furnace</b> showed a lower value than the simulation model due to the limitations in the <b>pot</b> <b>furnace.</b> Pressure drop is well calculated, but it is concluded that either mismeasurements regarding the pellets in the <b>pot</b> <b>furnace</b> occur or that the simulation model overestimated one or several variables. The drying process has been proved to be the most difficult parameter to predict by the bed model. This partly due to the regulating process in the <b>pot</b> <b>furnace</b> and also calculation faults in the bed model. From this study, further work should focus on these parameters when evaluating the bed model. It should also focus on comparing the simulation model with a new developed <b>pot</b> <b>furnace</b> and also the full scale Grate-kiln process...|$|R

40|$|Combustion {{of solid}} fuels on a grate is widely used. Mostly, the {{combustion}} behaviour {{is explained by}} the classical theory of Rogers. However, that theory cannot explain the combustion process when primary air preheating is applied. Solid fuel grate combustion is studied by experiments in a <b>pot</b> <b>furnace.</b> Experiments with and without primary air heating are described. These are compared with conclusions learnt from real plant experiments. It {{was found that the}} <b>pot</b> <b>furnace</b> experiments have a limited value in explaining the combustion behaviour of solid fuels on a grate. In {{order to be able to}} explain the results from practice an quantitative extension of Rogers' theory for the case with air preheating is presented. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Single</b> <b>pot</b> still whiskey is a {{style of}} Irish whiskey made by a single {{distillery}} from a mixed mash of malted and unmalted barley distilled in a pot still. Somewhat similar to single malt whiskey, the style was defined by its inclusion of unmalted raw barley in the mash in addition to malt. However, on occasion, small amounts of raw oats or wheat {{may also have been}} used. This unmalted component is said to give <b>single</b> <b>pot</b> whiskey a [...] "spicier bristle" [...] and [...] "thicker texture" [...] than the otherwise similar single malt whiskeys. If the whiskey is not distilled totally on the site of a single distillery, then it may be termed pot still whiskey, but not <b>single</b> <b>pot</b> still whiskey.|$|R

40|$|A simple {{model of}} bubble {{behaviour}} in a melting {{space with a}} vertical circulation of the molten glass was derived. Subsequently, two cases were considered. The first case with a constant, radially independent value of the angular velocity of the glass-melt rotation approximately demonstrated the heating through {{the wall of the}} <b>pot</b> <b>furnace</b> for glass melting, and the second case, where the angular velocity decreased from the centre of the space towards the wall, represented the heating of the <b>pot</b> <b>furnace</b> from above. The chosen values of the angular velocities corresponded to temperature gradients commonly occurring in melting spaces. The starting positions of critical (last removed) bubbles were sought along with their trajectories and fining times. The much higher calculated fining times of critical bubbles in the rotating melt as compared with the fining times of the bubbles just rising through the quiescent glass melt were explained by the deceleration of the bubble rising with respect to the fixed coordinates through the downward part of the glass vertical circulation. This fact leads to a long retention of the bubble in the melt and consequently to high energy consumption and low melting performance. The semiempirical equations were presented, providing the fining time of the critical bubble {{as a function of the}} bubble-growth rate and melt-rotation velocity...|$|R

Although once the most popular style of whiskey consumed in the world, pot still whiskey fell out of favour in the 20th century, in part due to the rise of cheaper, less intense blended whiskeys. Therefore, as a result of falling demand, most Irish whiskeys were either reformulated as blends or discontinued.|$|R
