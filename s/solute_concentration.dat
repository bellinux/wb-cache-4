5|$|The {{relationship}} between cellular proliferation and mitochondria {{has been investigated}} using cervical cancer HeLa cells. Tumor cells require an ample amount of ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) in order to synthesize bioactive compounds such as lipids, proteins, and nucleotides for rapid cell proliferation. The majority of ATP in tumor cells is generated via the oxidative phosphorylation pathway (OxPhos). Interference with OxPhos have shown to cause cell cycle arrest suggesting that mitochondria {{play a role in}} cell proliferation. Mitochondrial ATP production is also vital for cell division in addition to other basic functions in the cell including the regulation of cell volume, <b>solute</b> <b>concentration,</b> and cellular architecture. ATP levels differ at various stages of the cell cycle suggesting that there is a {{relationship between}} the abundance of ATP and the cell's ability to enter a new cell cycle. ATP's role in the basic functions of the cell make the cell cycle sensitive to changes in the availability of mitochondrial derived ATP. The variation in ATP levels at different stages of the cell cycle support the hypothesis that mitochondria {{play an important role in}} cell cycle regulation. Although the specific mechanisms between mitochondria and the cell cycle regulation is not well understood, studies have shown that low energy cell cycle checkpoints monitor the energy capability before committing to another round of cell division.|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} {{for determining the}} <b>concentration</b> of certain <b>solutes</b> in solidified culture media. The method {{is based upon the}} finding that under specified conditions the <b>concentration</b> of <b>solute</b> in an agar gel (Cg) is related to the <b>concentration</b> of <b>solute</b> in a centrifugally extracted gel supernatant (Cs) by the ratio, Cg/Cs, which is characteristic for each solute. The method avoids direct assays of the gels and instead involves assaying the supernatants from inoculated and uninoculated (control) gels with conventional liquid assay techniques and then calculating <b>solute</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the inoculated gels by use of the Cg/Cs ratios determined from the controls. Uninoculated agar gels containing known <b>concentrations</b> of various <b>solutes</b> and similar gels inoculated with Neurospora crassa or Escherichia coli were centrifuged at various times, and the supernatants were assayed for <b>solute</b> <b>concentrations.</b> The <b>solute</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the supernatants from the inoculated gels multiplied by the Cg/Cs ratios for those solutes determined at the same times for the uninoculated controls gave calculated <b>solute</b> <b>concentrations</b> in the inoculated gels.

25|$|Xylem sap {{consumption}} may {{be related}} to osmoregulation. High osmotic pressure in the stomach, caused by high sucrose concentration, can lead to water transfer from the hemolymph to the stomach, thus resulting in hyperosmotic stress and eventually to the death of the insect. Aphids avoid this fate by osmoregulating through several processes. Sucrose concentration is directly reduced by assimilating sucrose toward metabolism and by synthesizing oligosaccharides from several sucrose molecules, thus reducing the <b>solute</b> <b>concentration</b> and consequently the osmotic pressure. Oligasaccharides are then excreted through honeydew, explaining its high sugar concentrations, which can then be used by other animals such as ants. Furthermore, water is transferred from the hindgut, where osmotic pressure has already been reduced, to the stomach to dilute stomach content. Eventually, aphids consume xylem sap to dilute the stomach osmotic pressure. All these processes function synergetically, and enable aphids to feed on high-sucrose-concentration plant sap, as well as to adapt to varying sucrose concentrations.|$|E
25|$|When {{conditions}} are conducive to stomatal opening (e.g., high light intensity and high humidity), a proton pump drives protons (H+) from the guard cells. This {{means that the}} cells' electrical potential becomes increasingly negative. The negative potential opens potassium voltage-gated channels and so an uptake of potassium ions (K+) occurs. To maintain this internal negative voltage so that entry of potassium ions does not stop, negative ions balance the influx of potassium. In some cases, chloride ions enter, while in other plants the organic ion malate is produced in guard cells. This increase in <b>solute</b> <b>concentration</b> lowers the water potential inside the cell, which results in the diffusion of water into the cell through osmosis. This increases the cell's volume and turgor pressure. Then, because of rings of cellulose microfibrils that prevent {{the width of the}} guard cells from swelling, and thus only allow the extra turgor pressure to elongate the guard cells, whose ends are held firmly in place by surrounding epidermal cells, the two guard cells lengthen by bowing apart from one another, creating an open pore through which gas can move.|$|E

Herbaceous plants {{have a relatively}} high growth rate and many are active phloem loaders. Active loaders {{tend to have a}} high hydraulic conductivity and low <b>solute</b> <b>concentrations,</b> while passive loaders have high <b>solute</b> <b>concentrations</b> and a low hydraulic conductivity. Trees also exhibit high <b>solute</b> <b>concentrations</b> and low hydraulic conductivity and thus are thought to be passive loaders. Based on early research, scientists correlated herbaceous species with active loading and trees and other woody species with passive loading. However, in 2011, Davidson et al. examined the correlation between growth from and phloem-loading strategy. They found that a loose association exists but not a definitive correlation. Some trees exhibit active loading, while some herbs exhibit passive loading, and many species have mechanisms of both.|$|R
500|$|The {{sample holder}} {{held up to}} 4 cells. Cells could be moved into the light path via an {{external}} control, allowing the user to take multiple readings without opening the cell compartment. As described in the DU's manual, absorbance measurements of a sample were made in comparison to a blank, or standard, [...] "a solution identical in composition with the sample except that the absorbing material being measured is absent." [...] The standard could be a cell filled with a solvent such as distilled water or a prepared solvent of a known concentration. At each wavelength two measurements are made: with the sample and with the standard in the light beam. This enables the ratio, transmittance, to be obtained. For quantitative measurements transmittance is converted to absorbance which {{is proportional to the}} <b>solute</b> <b>concentration</b> according to Beer's law. This makes possible the quantitative determination of the amount of a substance in solution.|$|E

However, all of the females have the same morphology {{and they all have}} the physiological capability of taking over the egg laying if necessary (queen death, queen migration). Since the queen has the same morphology {{as the rest of the}} workers in the colony, this raises the question as to how the queen role is assigned and what makes her special. Studies have found that queens and males have higher levels of glucose, fructose and trehalose than workers, leading to higher cryoprotectant levels. P.exclamans use these sugars as cryoprotectant, which work by increasing the <b>solute</b> <b>concentration</b> in cells. This results in a greater survivability in colder weather. It was found that queens have a 76% survival rate in [...] weather compared to 17% survival of the workers over a 15-day test period. The queens also have a 0.5mm layer of fat surrounding their bodies. This allows them to live longer into the winter and possibly extend their mating season. The queens seem to be the only ones capable of diapause.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the biggest}} factors that affect active space size will be the [...] {{mediated}} by <b>solute</b> <b>concentration</b> in the water. Itâs been shown that momyrids have adapted its optimal active range in lower-conductivity habitats. One natural phenomenon that supports such theory is that, many species spawn during the time when rivers/ lakes have the lowest conductivity due to heavy rains. Having bigger active space in water with low conductivity will therefore benefit mating and courting. One other explanation tested by Kim and Moller is that, having smaller active space during dry season when mating is not occurring accommodates crowded social spacing without unnecessary signal transmission between individuals.|$|E

40|$|A {{stagnant}} film {{model of}} the effects of thermosolutal convection on free dendritic growth of alloys is developed, and its predictions are compared to available earth-based experimental data for succinonitrileacetone alloys. It is found that the convection model gives excellent agreement with the measured dendrite tip velocities and radii for low <b>solute</b> <b>concentrations.</b> However, at higher <b>solute</b> <b>concentrations</b> the present predictions show some deviations from the measured data, and the measured (thermal) Peclet numbers tend to fall even below the predictions from diffusion theory. Furthermore, the measured selection parameter (sigma*) is significantly above the expected value of 0. 02 and exhibits strong scatter. It is shown that convection is not responsible for these discrepancies. Some of the deviations between the predicted and measured data at higher supercoolings could be caused by measurement difficulties. The systematic disagreement in the selection parameter for higher <b>solute</b> <b>concentrations</b> and all supercoolings examined, indicates that the theory for the selection of the dendrite tip operating state in alloys may need to be reexamined...|$|R
2500|$|... where C is a constant, [...] is the solute diffusivity, [...] is the <b>solute</b> <b>concentration,</b> and [...] is the misfit parameter, [...] is {{the applied}} stress. So {{it could be}} seen from the {{equation}} above, m is 3 for solute drag creep. Solute drag creep shows a special phenomenon, which is called the Portevin-Le Chatelier effect. When the applied stress becomes sufficiently large, the dislocations will break away from the solute atoms since dislocation velocity increases with the stress. After breakaway, the stress decreases and the dislocation velocity also decreases, which allows the solute atoms to approach and reach the previously departed dislocations again, leading to a stress increase. The process repeats itself when the next local stress maximum is obtained. So repetitive local stress maxima and minima could be detected during solute drag creep.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the changes in}} amnioticfluid (AF) volume and <b>solute</b> <b>concentrations</b> during the last 3 weeks ofgestation in fetal sheep with a ligated urachus. METHODS: AF volume as well as <b>solute</b> <b>concentrations</b> of AF, fetal urine, fetal blood, and maternal blood were measured serially over the last 24 days of gestation in chronically catheterized fetal sheep. Statistical analyses included regression analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: Delivery occurred at 145. 5 1. 1 (SE) days (n = 11 animals). AF volume averaged 913 Â± 46 mL (n = 119 determinations totalfrom 11 animals) and was unchanged with time when analyzed against either gestational age (P =. 9) or time prior to delivery (P =. 81). Amniotic osmolality, sodium, chloride, glucose, and calcium concentrations decreased as gestation progressed, while potassium and lactate concentrations increased. Only amniotic lactate underwent a pre-delivery increase in concentration. From multivariate regression, AF <b>solute</b> <b>concentrations</b> correlated positively with fetal blood and urine concentra-tions and negatively with gestational age. CONCLUSIONS: In fetal sheep with a ligated urachus, AF volume does not decrease prior to labor and delivery. This dfiersfrom the sharp pre-delivery decrease in AF volume that occurs in rats, mice, and pigs and {{is similar to the}} relatively constant AF volume in humans, baboons, and monkeys. Further, pre-delivery changes in AF lactate concentration may reflect the consequences of a low AF volume. Regression analysis suggests thatfetal blood and urine independently contribute to AF <b>solute</b> <b>concentrations</b> and that gestational age-specfic changes in intramembranous transport also may contribute.

The double-membrane system consists of two membranes (M-u, M-d) oriented in horizontal planes and three identical compartments (u, m, d), containing unstirred binary or ternary ionic solutions.

The field-scale soils are considered heterogeneous with stationary fluctuations of soil hydraulic properties in the horizontal direction but nonstationary fluctuations of these properties in the vertical direction due to statistical heterogeneity of the soil profile. For the quantification of soil contamination risks, first, almost exact ensemble probability distribution functions of solute travel time for stochastic vertical convective solute transport within above-described heterogeneous field scale soils under both deterministic and stochastic water application rates and unsteady-nonuniform moisture flows were derived directly from the convective transport stochastic partial differential equation (PDE) under general depth-varying initial and time-varying boundary conditions.
