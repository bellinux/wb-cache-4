25|$|Kenseth <b>started</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> {{back for}} the Daytona 500 and worked {{his way to the}} lead and led 2 laps, but soon after his own teammate, David Ragan, {{squeezed}} him into the wall, knocking both out of contention and resulting in a finish of 36th.|$|E
500|$|The Long Branch Saloon Shootout, {{involving}} Levi Richardson, {{a buffalo}} hunter, and [...] "Cockeyed Frank" [...] Loving, a professional gambler, happened on April 5, 1879. Richardson had developed some affection for Loving's wife Mattie, {{and the two}} began to argue about her. In the saloon, Frank sat down at a long table, Richardson turned around and took {{a seat at the}} same table. The two were then heard speaking in low voices. After the conversation, Richardson drew his pistol, and Loving drew his in response. The Long Branch Saloon was then filled with smoke. Dodge City Marshal Charlie Bassett, who was in Beatty & Kelley's Saloon, heard the shots and came running. Both men were still standing, although Richardson had fired five shots from his gun and Loving's Remington No. 44 was empty. Deputy Sheriff Duffey threw Richardson down in a chair and took his gun, while Bassett disarmed Loving. Richardson then got up and <b>started</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> billiard table, when he fell to the floor with a fatal gunshot in the chest, as well as a shot through the side and another through the right arm. Frank Loving, who had only a slight scratch on the hand, was immediately taken to jail. Two days later, the coroner's inquest ruled that the killing had been in self-defense and Loving was immediately released.|$|E
60|$|The man <b>started</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> {{door with}} the card in his hand. He turned suddenly.|$|E
60|$|The {{young people}} had risen and were <b>starting</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door when an imperative, long {{drawn-out}} rapping startled them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where does Mis' Dean live?" [...] the lad asked hurriedly, <b>starting</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door; and he {{was already}} outside when Gladys replied: ...|$|R
60|$|For May Martha Mangum abides with me. There is an eight-room {{house in}} a live-oak grove, and a piano with an {{automatic}} player, and a good <b>start</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> three thousand head of cattle is under fence.|$|R
60|$|Idella had clung fast to Annie's hand; as Annie <b>started</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> dining-room she got before her, {{and whispered}} vehemently.|$|E
6000|$|... "Suit yourselves about that," [...] was the {{careless}} reply, as Bill <b>started</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> {{store to}} confer with the superintendent.|$|E
60|$|He {{shut off}} the {{phonograph}} with a snap, <b>started</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door after her, then abruptly flung himself into a chair.|$|E
60|$|To <b>start</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> village {{immediately}} {{would be}} to take too many chances of detection, and Sam loitered {{on the outskirts of}} the crowd watching for the desired opportunity, which came when Fred left the slope to carry Donovan's message to Mr. Wright.|$|R
50|$|Departure {{from his}} home after the opening of Navigation on Lake Huron would have allowed {{plenty of time to}} reach the Sault, however, the desire of making a <b>start</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> promised land was too strong for his {{patience}} and he left the East during the next month.|$|R
50|$|PA 837 {{begins at}} PA 88 in Carroll Township. It {{actually}} <b>starts</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> east-southeast <b>toward</b> Donora. Before entering Donora, it {{turns to the}} north and passes the Monessen Bridge and becomes S. McKean Avenue. It leaves Donora as Meldon Avenue after passing the Donora-Webster Bridge at 10th Street.|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} he <b>started</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> {{companionway}} {{leading to the}} officers' cabins. Barbara Harding hesitated {{at the top of}} the stairway.|$|E
60|$|When it was daylight, {{the girl}} bathed {{her face in}} a little {{rippling}} brook, and soon after they all <b>started</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Emerald City.|$|E
60|$|Just then {{a little}} puff of smoke arose from the machine, {{followed}} by a tongue of yellow flame. Barney had already <b>started</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> horse.|$|E
50|$|Before the pitch, {{the runner}} takes a lead-off, walking several {{steps away from}} the base as a head <b>start</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> next base. Even a runner who does not intend to steal takes a {{secondary}} lead of a few more steps, once the pitcher has legally committed to complete the pitch.|$|R
60|$|On {{the next}} day came another {{surprise}} for the Rovers. All of them {{were out on the}} campus when they saw Brassy Bangs leap a side hedge and <b>start</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> school. At the same time they saw a tall man wearing a slouch hat hurrying off in the opposite direction.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's what I'm coming to," [...] George continued. [...] "You don't {{have to stay}} here." [...] (Al's face brightened, and he involuntarily made a movement, {{as though}} about to <b>start</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> carriage.) [...] "On the other hand, it is not {{necessary}} that you should return with me. There is another way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The detectives!" [...] shouted Mr. Hoxie, as he <b>started</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> tool-house, where, in a {{very few}} seconds, he would be {{counterfeiting}} the most profound slumber.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never {{mind the}} story. I don't {{want to hear}} it, for I haven't the time," [...] the officer said, as he <b>started</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> judge's bench.|$|E
6000|$|Teddy {{understood}} {{this to be}} an intimation that the interview was at an end, and he <b>started</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> cane-board, the lawyer asking as he followed him: ...|$|E
50|$|The runner {{will often}} {{take a few}} steps off the base {{in order to have}} a head <b>start</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> next base. The runner will {{generally}} not go too far away from the base so if the pitcher does throw, he can return safely. But the pitcher will hope to catch the runner off-guard.|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{the rest}} must be dead," [...] Klaus {{said in a}} low voice. [...] "It came quickly. This morning the Politburo reached their decision. They {{notified}} us--forward command. Our runner was sent out at once. We saw him <b>start</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> direction of your lines. We covered him until he was out of sight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lydia Blood!" [...] {{cried the}} other woman, {{springing}} responsively to her feet, also, and <b>starting</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> girl, [...] "don't you go a step without you feel just like it! Take off your things this minute and stay, if you wouldn't jus' as lives go. It's {{hard enough to}} have you go, child, without seemin' to force you!" ...|$|R
60|$|It was a {{weak and}} shaken voice, {{and it was}} a weak and shaken man that pulled himself out of the Morris chair. He <b>started</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door.|$|E
6000|$|Jimmy Skunk hitched up his {{trousers}} and <b>started</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Lone Little Path. [...] "Come on!" [...] said he. [...] "Let's follow him {{and see what}} he is about." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You cannot enter here!" [...] cried Bob, as {{the first}} man <b>started</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> lane, {{as if he would}} force his way past those who were {{guarding}} the entrance.|$|E
60|$|Silence. Hendricks {{lowered the}} transmitter. He looked {{carefully}} around him. The entrance was just ahead. Almost at his feet. He lowered the antenna and fastened the transmitter to his belt. Carefully, he gripped his gun with both hands. He moved forward, a {{step at a}} time. If they could see him they knew he was <b>starting</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> entrance. He closed his eyes a moment.|$|R
5000|$|Slotbacks {{are often}} {{as many as}} five yards behind the line of {{scrimmage}} when the ball is snapped and, in the Canadian and indoor game, may also make a running <b>start</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> line of scrimmage prior to the snap. (In most forms of American football, this would be an illegal motion, although a few professional leagues such as the World Football League and XFL allowed forward motion.) ...|$|R
60|$|Peter Rabbit {{was on his}} {{way back}} from the pond of Paddy the Beaver deep in the Green Forest. He had just seen Mr. and Mrs. Quack <b>start</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Big River for a brief visit before leaving on their long, {{difficult}} journey to the far-away Southland. Farewells are always rather sad, and this particular farewell had left Peter with a lump in his throat,--a queer, choky feeling.|$|R
60|$|Immediately {{the hunters}} <b>started</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> elephants. The {{black in the}} tree hastened down, but Tarzan stalked, after his own fashion, along the leafy way of the middle terrace.|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess I ain't hungry after all," [...] she said, and <b>started</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door. He {{turned to}} the waiter, who {{regarded}} him unmoved, {{and asked for a}} check.|$|E
6000|$|Sam <b>started</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> entrance; {{but before}} {{reaching}} it {{he realized that}} he would be punishing no one but himself, and slowly turned back, saying as he approached the stove: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I never heard. He <b>started</b> off <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> east, {{into the}} plains of the Munchkin Country, {{and that was the}} last I ever saw of him." ...|$|R
50|$|You made us a {{marvelous}} mayor. I moved to New Orleans in 1937 {{and know what}} the city was before you took office 1946. You gave New Orleans its <b>start</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> great, progressive, industrial world city we have today. I saw you restore City Hall {{to a place of}} dignity, integrity, and respect. You gave your active support to every worthy move to improve the civic, business, social, cultural, and spiritual life of an entire community.|$|R
60|$|When the tongueless {{bell was}} struck {{three times the}} crowd {{gathered}} around the image bearers, and all <b>started</b> <b>toward</b> what <b>the</b> white men believed was the temple, chanting in perfect harmony with the music.|$|R
