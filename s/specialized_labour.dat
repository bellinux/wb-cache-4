40|$|Abstract. The {{increasing}} {{importance of}} the service sector in modern economies necessitates the elaboration of a body of location theory applicable to service activities. An attempt is made in this paper to present elements of such a locational framework, with specific reference to producer services. Patterns of trade and of location are complementary aspects of the same problem. Thus three distinct channels through which producer services are traded are examined: direct and intrafirm exports by producer-service firms, and intrafirm exports by manufacturing firms. The last two 'invisible ' channels, in particular, {{have important implications for}} the locational decision. A model for the locational analysis of producer-service establishments is then posited. The producer-service location problem may be conceptualized essentially as one of a trade-off between market-pull factors, <b>specialized</b> <b>labour</b> needs, and urban externalities. Last, the location of producer-service activities within the Canadian urban system is examined. These activities are found to be highly concentrated, but not in a simple hierarchical pattern, suggesting the importance of both <b>specialized</b> <b>labour</b> pools and urban externalities. ...|$|E

Using a new database, the paper concludes that by then there were as many neo-Marshallian exporting districts dominated by small firms as hub-firm districts coordinated by medium-large companies. This probably allowed the latter to combine the advantages derived from Marshallian external economies (i. e. non-codified knowledge, subsidiary industries and <b>specialized</b> <b>labour</b> force) with those connected to leading firms organizational capabilities. fashion, inheritance, industrial district, textiles and apparel, leather and footwear, competitive advantage, leading firms, clusters...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop {{a model of}} a {{vertically}} differentiated industry where the production of higher quality goods needs a higher fraction of <b>specialized</b> <b>labour.</b> In the first stage, firms choose the quality of their products, in the second, both good prices and skilled workers' wages are determined. We show that in duopoly, though supplying different variants of the product, firms tend to cluster either at the bottom or {{at the top of the}} quality ladder, depending on skilled labour availability. This switch in equilibrium qualities creates a discontinuous behaviour for the wage rate of skilled workers. When the supply of skilled labour is made endogenous, two equilibria are simultaneously possible: one with low-skill, low-quality, the other with high-skill, high-quality...|$|E

40|$|Agglomeration {{research}} {{investigates the}} benefits that firms receive from locating in close geographic proximity. Despite a substantial surge in interest in this topic over the past 20 years, a lack of distinction among unique manifestations of spatial concentrations of similar firms threatens continuing progress in this stream of research. We argue that agglomerations of related firms that draw benefits from the supply-related externalities of increased access to <b>specialized</b> <b>labour,</b> specialized inputs, and knowledge spillovers are fundamentally different from those that draw benefits from heightened demand realized through reduction in consumer search costs. Extending agglomeration theory, we explicate the differences between these distinct phenomena, discuss how the nature of key theoretical relationships varies across these agglomeration types, and demonstrate significant implications for research. We discuss how the differences affect a host of theoretical relationships and empirical research decisions. Copyright (c) Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2009. ...|$|E
40|$|Labour {{migrants}} always {{leave their}} home country with some expectation and goals which they want {{to fill in the}} destination country. Their goals are strongly influenced by economic and political situation in both countries. This paper is based on an ethnographic research and it focuses on motives and strategies of current labour migrants from the Czech Republic. The most attractive country for them is the United Kingdom. They opened their labour markets for newcomers in May 2004 when the Czech Republic entered the EU. The research of current migrants shows that they look abroad for self-realization more than for purely economic reasons. Findings from the research indicate that the language plays the biggest importance in motivation for migration. However the economic motives still persist. The other influential factor for initiating migration is a favourable political situation. Among the contemporary labour migrants there can be detected two main strategies of entrance – the utilizing of social networks and using services of <b>specialized</b> <b>labour</b> agencies...|$|E
40|$|Oliver Williamson {{argues that}} the {{attributes}} of the employment contract, like intermediate transactions in general, are essentially driven by the specificity of assets. In {{the case of the}} organization of work it is the particular attributes of labour that determines the transaction costs of any given governance structure. The paper presents a stylized account of the transaction cost model of the efficient organization of work, stressing an underlying tension and ambiguity in the transaction cost framework. The paper exploits a unique dataset to test, {{for the first time with}} British data, Williamson's transaction cost predictions concerning the nature of employment contracts. Williamson tacitly assumes that asset specificity is exogenous in general. However, there is evidence in the literature that labour specificity is endogenous to employment contracts. The paper endeavours to demonstrate that there is empirical evidence to suggest that <b>specialized</b> <b>labour</b> is indeed endogenous in the transaction cost model. The major implication is that the organization of work cannot be considered as an example of the efficient organization of intermediate transactions. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} trade union formation. To this end we apply a model with {{two types of}} labour where the interests of both groups of labourers are represented by either a joint (industry) labour union or by two independent group-specific (professional) labour unions. We investigate whether, and if so, under which conditions, it is beneficial {{for at least one}} group of labourers to form its own independent union; or whether it {{is in the interest of}} both groups to have a joint industry labour union. Applying the (asymmetric) Nash bargaining solution, we find that under reasonable conditions, it is beneficial for at least one group of labourers to form its own independent labour union. In this case a joint union must be considered as an unstable institution. The profit share, however, is always higher if the firm bargains with a joint labour union. This explains why employers vehemently oppose recent split offs of <b>specialized</b> <b>labour</b> groups from existing industry unions and from tariff unions. trade-union formation, wage-employment bargains, Nash bargaining solution, industry and professional labour unions, trade union merger...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop an adaptive model of competency development for the electronics industry in Thailand. The study involved a questionnaire, interviews and observations. Eighty nine individuals completed the questionnaire. Interviews were conducted with 10 managers with high experience in competency development from five renowned companies which practiced competency development. Observation was conducted in the five companies. Our adaptive model consists of the following elements: (1) five electronics competency levels which can be compared to Thailand Vocational Qualification, (2) competencies development, and (3) a training model. The training model was composed of a training program, training module, 4 H (head, hands, habits, and health) assessment, as well as monitoring and follow-up. This model is particularly well-suited to the electronics industry in Thailand; however, we suggest that it may be useful in other contexts as well. In countries such as Thailand where there are shortages of <b>specialized</b> <b>labour,</b> models such as ours will {{play an important role in}} filling gaps and providing the expertise needed for industry...|$|E
40|$|A {{hierarchical}} {{methodology for}} the design of manufacturing cells is proposed, which includes labour-grouping considerations in addition to part-machine grouping. It is empirically driven and designed for an interactive decision environment, with an emphasis on fast execution times. The method synthesizes the capabilities of neural network methods for rapid clustering of large part-machine data sets, with multi-objective optimization capabilities of mathematical programming. The procedure includes three phases. In Phase I, part families and associated machine types are identified through neural network methods. Phase II involves a prioritization of part families identified, along with adjustments to certain load-related parameters. Phase III involves interactive goal programming for regrouping machines and labour into cells. In machine grouping, factors such as capacity constraints, cell size restrictions, minimization of load imbalances, minimization of intercell movements of parts, minimization of new machines to be purchased, provision of flexibility, etc. are considered. In labour grouping, the functionally <b>specialized</b> <b>labour</b> pools are partitioned and regrouped into cells. Factors such as minimization of hiring and cross-training costs, ensuring balanced loads for workers, minimization of intercell movements of workers, providing adequate levels of labour flexibility, etc. are considered in a pragmatic manner...|$|E
