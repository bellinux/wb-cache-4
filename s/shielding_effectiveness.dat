To demonstrate the accuracy and flexibility of the LBEM (linear boundary element method), the influence of the deformation degree of shielded deformed coaxial cable compared with the multipole theory on the results were discussed. Taking the overhead shielded coaxial cable and the overhead shielded two-core cable of ring seam as the research objects. The influences of ring seam in <b>shielded</b> <b>effectiveness</b> were analyzed by applying the LBEM with Matlab. The engineering example results showed that for overhead shield two-core cable, the change of coupling capacitance was related with the ring seam in deep layer of overhead shield two-core cable at the location of parallel core distance; and the change tendency of coupling capacitor with the ring seam at the vertical core distance was almost the same as the ring seam at the parallel core distance. But, when the ring seam depth was quite deep, very likely one core was exposed, and then the coupling capacitor decreased rapidly. Therefore the study of coupling effectiveness was instructive for more effective to defense EMI and will improve the overhead shielded cable electromagnetic compatibility.

They can modify the thermal properties of buildings to bring cooling energy conservation and improve human comfort. This study evaluates the thermodynamic transmission in the green roof ecosystem under different vegetation treatments. Our model simulation is based on the traditional Bowen ratio energy balance model (BREBM) and a proposed solar radiation <b>shield</b> <b>effectiveness</b> model (SEM). The BREBM investigates energy absorption of different components of radiation, and the SEM evaluates the radiation shield effects. The proposed model is tested and validated to be efficient to simulate solar energy transmission in green roofs, with some major findings. Firstly, the solar radiation transmission processes might be considered as free vibration motion. Daytime positive heat storage of the green roof is 350 - 520 W·m - 2 on an hourly basis. Nighttime or afternoon negative value registers a rather constant magnitude of - 60 W·m - 2. Daily net average is positive around 155 - 210 W·m - 2. Secondly, solar radiation vibration is highly correlated with plant structure. The canopy reflectance and transmittance are strongly correlated (R 2 = 0. 87). The multi-layer shrub treatment has the highest <b>shield</b> <b>effectiveness</b> (0. 34), followed by two-layer groundcover (0. 27), and single-layer grass (0. 16). Green roof vegetation absorbs and stores large amounts of heat to form an effective thermal buffer against daily temperature fluctuation. Vegetated roofs drastically depress air temperature in comparison with bare ground (control treatment). Finally, the thermodynamic model is relatively simple and efficient for investigating thermodynamic transmission in green roof ecosystem, and it could be developed into a broad solar radiant land cover model. © 2010 Elsevier B.

The sizes of the spherical enclosures investigated in the present work range from electrically small (perimeter is less than the wavelength) to electrically large (perimeter is up to ten times the wavelength). It is shown that for such an enclosure, both the RCS and SE, as functions of frequency, have sharp spikes, minima, or maxima at the resonant frequencies corresponding to the internal modes of the closed conducting sphere. Principal and higher order modes are considered. The effects of the aperture width on the perturbation of the field inside and outside of the spherical enclosure, the near field outside the cavity, the RCS and the SE are presented over a wide range of frequency.

Paired temperature observations, traceable to national standards and with a well-defined uncertainty budget, were performed employing two naturally ventilated weather stations equipped with identical sensors and different only for their working time. Three different tests were carried out employing different aged AWSs: a 5 -year-old AWS (AWS 5) was compared with a new device (AWS 0), a 1 year old (AWS 1) was compared with both a 3 years old (AWS 3) and a new one devices (AWS 00). Due to solar and weather conditions exposure a degradation of the screen reflective coating is evident for the older AWSs (5 and 3 years old) and so a qualitative estimation of how different conditions of ageing affect the temperature drift was done. During the comparison 0 to 5 and 1 to 3 -year-old screens, significant temperature differences were recorded at different times of the day. The differences, wider than the uncertainty amplitude, demonstrate a systematic effect. The temperature measured with the older screen is larger, and the maximum instantaneous difference was 1. 63 degrees C (for 0 - 5 years comparison) in daytime hours. During night-time the two AWS's measure the same temperature (within the uncertainty amplitude). This behaviour, increasing with increasing solar radiation intensity and decreasing with increasing wind speed, is attributed to a radiative heating effect.
