The main {{function of the}} scheme {{is to reduce the}} effect of the capacitive coupling on untransposed transmission lines to levels where successful <b>single-pole</b> <b>switching</b> is assured. The analysis procedure is carried out for six-phase transmission lines, but it could be applied to any n-phase system. In {{the first part of the}} research, the arc characteristics for various gap lengths are investigated. The results of the investigation are utilized in developing the transmission line gap recovery characteristics. Equations that express the capacitively-coupled secondary arc current and recovery voltage in terms of line constants and the compensation scheme element values are derived. A digital computer is used to find the optimum compensation element values using these equations. Two existing transmission line data are utilized as a demonstration of the adequacy of the {{shunt compensation}} in reducing the secondary arc current and the recovery voltage. The performance of the compensation scheme under various line conditions is verified by simulating the line and the compensation bank using the Electromagnetic Transient digital computer program. The results indicate that without the shunt compensation the <b>single-pole</b> <b>switching</b> application to EHV sixphase transmission lines will not be successful.
