500|$|... "Boy-Scoutz 'n the Hood" [...] {{was written}} by Dan McGrath and {{directed}} by Jeffrey Lynch. The episode was recorded at the Village Recorder in West Los Angeles. Ernest Borgnine guest starred in the episode as himself. The staff liked {{his work on the}} films Marty and From Here to Eternity, so they asked him to do a guest appearance on the show. Borgnine felt he could not <b>say</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> offer because his grandchildren were fans of the show. In the final scene of the episode, Borgnine plays a guitar and sings campfire songs with the children. Borgnine was a guitar player in real life, so he brought his own guitar with him to the recording studio. Borgnine apologized because he felt that he was not being able to sing very well, but Nancy Cartwright, who provides the voice of Bart, thought his voice [...] "added to the authenticity of his character". The Simpsonss creator Matt Groening thought the recording sessions with Borgnine were [...] "so much fun". Hank Azaria, who provides the voice of Apu, commented that Borgnine [...] "had no idea what the hell he was doing. He's a good actor, and he read his lines just fine, but {{he had no idea what}} the show was, no idea what we were doing." ...|$|E
500|$|The Jesuit critic William F. Lynch, who {{believed}} that salvation happens within time and not outside of it, explained what Eliot was attempting {{to do in the}} Four Quartets when he wrote: [...] "it is hard to <b>say</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> impression, if I may use a mixture of my own symbols and his, that the Christian imagination is finally limited to the element of fire, to the day of Pentecost, to the descent of the Holy Ghost upon the disciples. The revelation of eternity and time is of an intersection ... It seems not unseemly to suppose that Eliot's imagination (and is this not a theology?) is alive with points of intersection and of descent." [...] He continued with a focus on how time operated within the poem: [...] "He seems to place our faith, our hope, and our love, not in the flux of time but in the points of time. I am sure his mind is interested in the line and time of Christ, whose Spirit is his total flux. But I am not so sure about his imagination. Is it or is it not an imagination which is saved from time's nausea or terror by points of intersection? ... There seems little doubt that Eliot is attracted above all by the image and the goal of immobility, and that in everything he seeks for approximations to this goal in the human order." [...] Lynch went on to point out that this understanding of time includes Asian influences.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1966, Condon agreed to {{consider}} the Air Force's offer. He was among the best known and most distinguished scientists of his time. Condon's tenacious encounters with the House Unamerican Activities Committee and other government Loyalty Boards in the 1940s and 1950s made him [...] "almost legendary" [...] among fellow scientists. On Condon's behalf, Robert J. Low, an assistant dean of the university's graduate program, explored faculty reaction to the proposed project and found it mixed and wary. He tried to reassure those who found the enterprise unworthy of scientific investigation. Low told the Denver Post that the project had met the University's acceptance threshold by the narrowest of margins and was accepted largely because {{it was difficult to}} <b>say</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Air Force. Some have suggested that finances were factor in Colorado's decision to accept the Air Force's offer of $313,000 for the project. Condon dismissed this suggestion, noting that $313,000 was a rather modest budget for an undertaking scheduled to last more than a year with a staff of over a dozen.|$|E
2500|$|Bhansali was on {{the lookout}} for a mature couple for the {{portrayal}} of his lead roles in Guzaarish. After watching her films Dhoom 2 and Jodhaa Akbar (both of which had starred both Rai and Roshan), Bhansali decided that the pair exuded a dignity and elegance much needed for his film. Though Rai had agreed to the script without even reading it, Roshan was all set to <b>say</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> film. Amita Sehgal, Casting Director, roped in other actors including Shernaz Patel, Vijay Crishna, Nafisa Ali, [...] Aditya Roy Kapoor and Suhel Seth. Makrand Deshpande was recruited to play an important three-minute cameo in the film on Hrithik Roshan's suggestion. Bhansali said that he had always wanted to work together with Roshan {{for a very long time}} as he was impressed by his sincerity as an actor. He added that the script of Guzaarish gave him the right opportunity to sign him. About the leading lady, Aishwarya Rai, he said that the role suited her to perfection and though she would have accepted his offer, it was important for an actor to be convinced of what he or she is doing. Bhansali stated that if any of the leading cast had refused to sign, he wouldn't have made Guzaarish. He later stated saying, The film was only possible if Hrithik and Aishwarya had acted in it.|$|E

5000|$|The {{negative}} {{comes into}} play when people see {{their place in the}} social order and seek <b>to</b> reject it. <b>Saying</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> existing order is both a function of our language abilities and evidence of humans as choice makers. Burke coined the phrase [...] "rotten with perfection", which means that because our symbols allow us to imagine perfection, we always feel guilty about the difference between the reality and the perfection.|$|R

There is something so innocent, so guileless, so complacent, so unearthly serene and self-satisfied about this peerless [...] "hog-wash," [...] that the man must be made of stone who can read it without a dulcet ecstasy creeping along his backbone and quivering in his marrow. There is no need to say that this poem is genuine and in earnest, for its proofs are written all over its face. An ingenious scribbler might imitate it after a fashion, but Shakespeare himself could not counterfeit it. It is noticeable that the country editor who published it did not know that it was a treasure and the most perfect thing of its kind that the storehouses and museums of literature could show. He did not dare to <b>say</b> <b>no</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> dread poet--for such a poet must have been something of an apparition--but he just shoveled it into his paper anywhere that came handy, and felt ashamed, and put that disgusted [...] "Published by Request" [...] over it, and hoped that his subscribers would overlook it or not feel an impulse to read it: ...|$|E

40|$|A {{fundamental}} question in quantum mechanics is, {{whether it is}} possible to replicate an arbitrary unknown quantum state.

But it leaves open the following question: If the state is not arbitrary, but secretly chosen from a certain set = | Ψ _ 1 >,| Ψ_ 2 >, [...] .,| Ψ _n>, whether is the cloning possible? This question is of great practical significance because of its applications in quantum information theory. If the states | Ψ_ 1 >, | the no-cloning theorem, the linearity of quantum mechanics forbids such replication. In this paper, we show that, if the states | Ψ_ 1 >, | Ψ _ 2 >, [...] and | Ψ_n> are linearly-independent, they do can be cloned by a unitary-reduction process...|$|R
