5|$|A 2004 {{analysis}} of data from 53 studies involving 83,000 women with breast cancer reported no increased risk among women who had had either an induced or <b>spontaneous</b> abortion. The relative {{risk of breast cancer}} for women who had a <b>spontaneous</b> abortion in this analysis was 0.98, and that for induced abortion was 0.93.|$|E
5|$|Although {{multiple}} definitions exist, {{a tension}} pneumothorax {{is generally considered}} to be present when a pneumothorax (primary <b>spontaneous,</b> secondary <b>spontaneous,</b> or traumatic) leads to significant impairment of respiration and/or blood circulation. Tension pneumothorax tends to occur in clinical situations such as ventilation, resuscitation, trauma, or in patients with lung disease.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, {{the absence}} of notable trauma made it likely that there existed some <b>spontaneous</b> cause of separation.|$|E
5|$|Mendelevium-256, the {{chemically}} {{most important}} isotope of mendelevium, decays through electron capture 90.7% {{of the time}} and alpha decay 9.9% of the time. It is most easily detected through the <b>spontaneous</b> fission of its electron-capture daughter fermium-256, but in the presence of other nuclides that undergo <b>spontaneous</b> fission, alpha decays at the characteristic energies for mendelevium-256 (7.205 and 7.139MeV) can provide more useful identification.|$|E

5|$|<b>Spontaneous</b> pneumothoraces {{are divided}} into two types: primary, which occurs {{in the absence of}} known lung disease, and secondary, which occurs in someone with {{underlying}} lung disease. The cause of primary <b>spontaneous</b> pneumothorax is unknown, but established risk factors include male sex, smoking, and a family history of pneumothorax. Smoking either cannabis or tobacco increases the risk. The various suspected underlying mechanisms are discussed below.|$|E
5|$|<b>Spontaneous</b> {{subcutaneous}} emphysema {{is thought}} to result from increased pressures in the lung that cause alveoli to rupture. In <b>spontaneous</b> subcutaneous emphysema, air travels from the ruptured alveoli into the interstitium and along the blood vessels of the lung, into the mediastinum and from there into the tissues of the neck or head.|$|E

5|$|A 2015 {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis of prospective studies found insufficient {{evidence to support}} an association between induced or <b>spontaneous</b> abortion and {{an increased risk of}} breast cancer.|$|E
5|$|A <b>spontaneous</b> {{cerebrospinal}} fluid leak {{is one of}} several types of {{cerebrospinal fluid}} leaks and occurs due to the presence of one or more holes in the dura. A <b>spontaneous</b> CSF leak, as opposed to traumatically caused CSF leaks, arises idiopathically. A loss of CSF greater than its rate of production leads to a decreased volume inside the skull known as intracranial hypotension. Any CSF leak is most often characterized by orthostatic headaches — headaches that worsen in a vertical position and improve when lying down. Other symptoms can include neck pain or stiffness, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fatigue, and a metallic taste in the mouth (indicative of a cranial leak). A CT scan can identify the site of a cerebrospinal fluid leakage. Once identified, the leak can often be repaired by an epidural blood patch, an injection of the patient's own blood {{at the site of the}} leak, a fibrin glue injection or surgery. When the cause cannot be identified the set of symptoms is referred to as <b>spontaneous</b> cerebrospinal fluid leak syndrome (SCSFLS).|$|E

5|$|All parties, then, {{agree that}} the protests were {{organised}} beforehand; the main points of contention are whether the violence was planned or <b>spontaneous,</b> and whether the underlying tensions reflect separatist inclinations or a desire for social justice.|$|E

5|$|April 5: At Los Alamos, Emilio Segrè {{receives}} the first sample of reactor-bred plutonium from Oak Ridge, and within ten days discovers that the <b>spontaneous</b> fission rate {{is too high}} {{for use in a}} gun-type fission weapon (because of Pu-240 isotope present as an impurity in the Pu-239).|$|E
5|$|BHD can be {{suggested}} by clinical findings but is definitively diagnosed by molecular genetic testing to detect mutations in the FLCN gene.

5|$|In 1861, {{a student}} named Aristeidis Dosios (son of {{politician}} Konstantinos Dosios) attempted to murder Queen Amalia, and was openly {{hailed as a}} hero.

5|$|In 1997, Wingo et al. {{reviewed}} 32 {{studies on}} the abortion-breast cancer relationship {{and concluded that the}} results of studies on this subject were too inconsistent to allow for definitive conclusions, for either induced or <b>spontaneous</b> abortions.|$|E

5|$|In nuclear {{applications}} where graphite {{is used as}} {{a neutron}} moderator, accumulation of Wigner energy followed by a sudden, <b>spontaneous</b> release may occur. Annealing to at least 250°C can release the energy safely, although in the Windscale fire the procedure went wrong, causing other reactor materials to combust.|$|E
5|$|Invasion of bone by {{cancer is}} the most common source of cancer pain.

5|$|Isotopes of {{californium}} {{with mass}} numbers 237–256 are formed in nuclear reactors; californium-253 is a β-emitter {{and the rest}} are α-emitters. The isotopes with even mass numbers (250Cf, 252Cf and 254Cf) have {{a high rate of}} <b>spontaneous</b> fission, especially 254Cf of which 99.7% decays by <b>spontaneous</b> fission. Californium-249 has a relatively long half-life (352 years), weak <b>spontaneous</b> fission and strong γ-emission that facilitates its identification. 249Cf is not formed in large quantities in a nuclear reactor because of the slow β-decay of the parent isotope 249Bk and a large cross section of interaction with neutrons, but it can be accumulated in the isotopically pure form as the β-decay product of (pre-selected) 249Bk. Californium produced by reactor-irradiation of plutonium mostly consists of 250Cf and 252Cf, the latter being predominant for large neutron fluences, and its study is hindered by the strong neutron radiation.|$|E
5|$|Natural uranium {{consists}} of three major isotopes: uranium-238 (99.28% natural abundance), uranium-235 (0.71%), and uranium-234 (0.0054%). All three are radioactive, emitting alpha particles, with the exception that {{all three of these}} isotopes have small probabilities of undergoing <b>spontaneous</b> fission, rather than alpha emission. There are also five other trace isotopes: uranium-239, which is formed when 238U undergoes <b>spontaneous</b> fission, releasing neutrons that are captured by another 238U atom; uranium-237, which is formed when 238U captures a neutron but emits two more, which then decays to neptunium-237; and finally, uranium-233, which is formed in the decay chain of that neptunium-237. It is also expected that thorium-232 should be able to undergo double beta decay, which would produce uranium-232, but this has not yet been observed experimentally.|$|E

5|$|SCSFLS is {{classified}} into two main types, cranial leaks and spinal leaks. The {{vast majority of}} leaks are spinal. Cranial leaks occur in the head. In some of these cases, CSF can be seen dripping out of the nose, or ear. Spinal leaks occur when one or more holes form in the dura along the spinal cord. Both cranial and spinal <b>spontaneous</b> CSF leaks cause neurological symptoms as well as <b>spontaneous</b> intracranial hypotension, diminished volume and pressure of the cranium. While referred to as intracranial hypotension, the intracranial pressure may be normal, with the underlying issue instead being low-volume CSF. For this reason SCSFLS {{is referred to as}} CSF hypovolemia as opposed to CSF hypotension.|$|E
5|$|Some {{cases of}} {{nearsightedness}} {{are recognized as}} due to a transient spasm of the ciliary muscle, rather than a misshapen eyeball. These are classed as pseudomyopia, of which <b>spontaneous</b> reversal may account for some reports of improvement.|$|E
5|$|<b>Spontaneous</b> {{ventilation}} {{has been}} traditionally performed with an inhalational agent (i.e. gas induction or inhalational induction using halothane or sevoflurane) however {{it can also}} be performed using intravenous anaesthesia (e.g. propofol, ketamine or dexmedetomidine). <b>SponTaneous</b> Respiration using IntraVEnous anaesthesia and High-flow nasal oxygen (STRIVE Hi) is an open airway technique that uses an upwards titration of propofol which maintains ventilation at deep levels of anaesthesia. It has been used in airway surgery as an alternative to tracheal intubation.|$|E
