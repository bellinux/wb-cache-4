5|$|The Sisters faced {{controversy}} {{not only}} from public opinion, but also within the medical profession. Initially the response of Montreal doctors was positive, and in 1850 the College of Physicians petitioned Bishop Bourget for permission to send students to the Hospice de Sainte-Pélagie for training, which Bourget granted {{over the objections of}} the Sisters. However, friction arose between the <b>Sisters</b> <b>and</b> the students; the Sisters did not want the students present (a position shared by many of the unwed mothers), while the students were often contemptuous, rude, or dismissive towards their patients. Combined with the competency of the Misericorde <b>Sisters,</b> <b>and</b> their non-profit mandate, this friction bloomed into hostility between the <b>Sisters</b> <b>and</b> Montreal physicians, who came to see the midwives as a professional threat.|$|E
