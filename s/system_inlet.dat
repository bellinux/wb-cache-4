This study focuses {{on the impact of}} uncertainties in the operational condition of the surface drainage system on pluvial flood hazard. The flood propagation model FLURB- 2 D is implemented on a selected study area in the town of Genoa (Italy). Synthetic hyetographs based on the Chicago and bivariate copula methods with suitable return periods are used as input. While simulating the design rainfall, inlet operational conditions are varied stochastically using a Monte Carlo approach. Results confirm that microtopography has the potential to impact the efficiency of surface drainage and consequently to produce local flooding, with significant water depth in zones of flow concentration.

30|$|The air <b>inlet</b> <b>system</b> of {{traditional}} engines mainly relies on absorption by the quarter-wavelength straight-tube to suppress high-frequency noise, but two major problems exist. First, the quarter-wavelength straight-tube has a narrow denoising band and cannot cover the low-frequency noise band completely, {{which results in}} incomplete noise reduction. Second, due to the greatly restricted radial size of the air inlet tube in the engine’s <b>inlet</b> <b>system,</b> the longer length of the traditional quarter-wavelength straight-tube {{will be difficult to}} arrange in a compact car air <b>inlet</b> <b>system.</b> Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new type of muffler design, which has the advantages of both the quarter-wavelength straight-tube and Helmholtz muffler, with a wider noise elimination frequency band and smaller radial size. When used in a practical automobile test, the muffler showed excellent performance in high frequency noise reduction of the air <b>inlet</b> <b>system,</b> and this performance was supported by the experimental data.|$|R

This work was aimed to analyse, into a real case, the entire anaerobic digestion process, highlighting the parameters that govern the hydrogen sulphide production, and to study the behaviour of a biotrickling filter for fine desulphurisation of real biogas to be fed into a laboratory scale HT-PEM (High Temperature Proton Exchange Membrane) fuel cell system.

To improve the thermal efficiency of the solar collector <b>system,</b> <b>inlet</b> water temperature should be as low as possible.

Such a condition may exist as part of an in progress episode gas release (EGR) or gas plume event. The analysis goal was to determine the volume of flammable gas that if burned within the dome airspace would result in a differential pressure, after propagating through the ventilation system, greater than the current High Efficiency Particulate Filter (HEPA) limit of 2. 49 KPa (10 inches of water or 0. 36 psi).

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{analysis of}} the charge exchange process in a spark ignition engine has been presented. This process has {{significant impact on the}} effectiveness of engine operation because it is related to the necessity of overcoming the flow resistance, followed by the necessity of doing a work, so-called the charge exchange work. The flow resistance caused by the throttling valve is especially high during the part load operation. The open Atkinson-Miller cycle has been assumed as a model of processes taking place in the engine. Using fully variable inlet valve timing the A-M cycle can be realized according to two systems: system with late inlet valve closing and system with early inlet valve closing. The systems have been analysed individually and comparatively with the open Seiliger-Sabathe cycle which is a theoretical cycle for the classical throttle governing of the engine load. Benefits resulting from application of the systems with independent inlet valve control have been assessed {{on the basis of the}} selected parameters: fuel dose, cycle work, charge exchange work and a cycle efficiency. The use of the analysed systems to governing of the SI engine load will enable to eliminate a throttling valve from the <b>system</b> <b>inlet</b> and reduce the charge exchange work, especially within the range of part load operation...|$|E
