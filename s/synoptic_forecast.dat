In contrast, subsequent studies proposed that many mesoscale circulations inherit the predictability of the large-scale flow, and thereby remain predictable over relatively long time scales. To compare these different perspectives, 100 -member ensemble forecasts were conducted for two powerful winter storms that struck the East Coast of the United States in 2010. A cycling ensemble Kalman filter was used to generate the initial conditions for each ensemble member, {{and the evolution of}} the ensemble spread was assessed through forecasts of snow-water equivalent precipitation, total precipitation, the 850 -hPa temperature, and the sea-level pressure.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Although it was {{originally}} suggested that small-scale, unresolved errors corrupt forecasts at all scales through an inverse error cascade, some authors have proposed that those mesoscale circulations resulting from stationary forcing on the larger scale may inherit the predictability of the large-scale motions. Further, the relative contributions of large- and small-scale uncertainties in producing error growth in the mesoscales remain largely unknown. Here, 100 member ensemble forecasts are initialized from an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to simulate two winter storms impacting the East Coast of the United States in 2010. Four verification metrics are considered: the local snow water equivalence, total liquid water, and 850 hPa temperatures representing mesoscale features; and the sea level pressure field representing a synoptic feature. It is found that while the predictability of the mesoscale features can be tied to the <b>synoptic</b> <b>forecast,</b> significant uncertainty existed on the synoptic scale at lead times as short as 18 hours. Therefore, mesoscale details remained uncertain in both storms due to uncertainties at the large scale. Additionally, the ensemble perturbation kinetic energy did not show an appreciable upscale propagation of error for either case. Instead, the initial condition perturbations from the cycling EnKF were maximized at large scales and immediately amplified at all scales without requiring initial upscale propagation. This suggests that relatively small errors in the synoptic-scale initialization may have more importance in limiting predictability than errors in the unresolved, small-scale initial conditions...|$|E

These features are {{in contrast to the}} traditional occultist or soothsayer style of prediction. The recently-advanced, pre-emptive hypothesis that earthquakes are intrinsically unpredictable, and precursors non-existent, is also amenable to testing: it is refuted by the well-known relations between mainshocks and aftershocks. These relations show that a set of aftershocks is to a high degree predictable from the mainshock, so that, as a matter of principle, the mainshock is a precursor to its aftershocks. This result is compatible with the power-law property of seismicity, on which the unpredictability hypothesis is based. Empirical research on most precursors is difficult because of the scarcity of data, and is still largely at the anecdotal stage. Additional difficulties at the experimental stage are exemplified by the failure of the Tokai and Parkfield experiments to advance the study of precursors as planned. A comparative abundance of data is available on seismicity anomalies, and research on this type of precursor is progressing towards the operational stage...|$|R

The results add strength to the hypothesis that swarms are long-range predictors of mainshock events. A close similarity between the swarm and aftershock magnitudes in a given sequence is also confirmed in Greece, supporting the proposal that swarms {{are an integral part of}} the seismogenic process in subduction regions.

In the case of the space-based doppler lidar, the full range of space scales applies. Single shot pulses with dimensions of 10 x 1000 meters are used to sample areas 100, 000 x 100, 000 meters to resolved mass flow structure with wavelength of 1 million meters. Simulation studies, therefore, require an equally broad range of atmospheric models. A general circulation model is appropriate to answer questions regarding the impact of a global wind measuring system upon <b>synoptic</b> <b>forecasts.</b> Since the nominal resolution of the spacebased system {{is expected to be a}} few 100 's of kilometers, then a numerical model with mesoscale dynamics is required. The meaning of an average Doppler shift within a laser pulse volume must be evaluated with models of turbulent/convective scale motions and aerosol gradients. Examples of how models on all these scales have been applied in an ongoing simulation study are presented. In particular, the uncertainties in a mesoscale wind estimate are separated into those arising from pulse scale variances and those due to sample distribution within a prescribed resolution volume.

40|$|The {{stochastic}} dynamic equations, as {{investigated in}} part I of this two-part study, {{can be applied}} to any timedependent set of differential equations which are, at most, nonlinear quadratic. In this study, they are used to explore various aspects of the question of atmospheric predictability. The growth of uncertainty due to ill-defined initial conditions in the nonlinear advection field is viewed by considering a simple barotropic model. A wave number is defined to be “unpredictable ” when the “uncertain ” energy associated with that wave becomes as large as the “certain ” energy associated with it. The predictability of wave number 12 is used as a reference point and as an arbitrary minimum requirement for useful <b>synoptic</b> <b>forecasts.</b> It is found that, based upon the average root-mean-square vector error in the wind field today, such a wave number has a predictability value of about 1. 5 days. If this error could be reduced by a factor of 4 (Le., down to 1 m/s), this value would be approximately 5 days. Using a stochastic barotropic model with 2, 015 degrees of freedom, it is found that any initial energy spectra for the certain or uncertain eddy kinetic energy will give essentially the same predictability values. This is because the complete nonlinearity is accounted for in the stochastic dynamic equation set and the dynamics of the two-dimensional fluid tend to drive any initial spectrum into approximately a- 3 power law in some averaged senseas expected from theory...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHeavy {{rainfall}} {{events are}} rather common in Southern France and result frequently in devastating flash floods. Thus, an appropriate anticipation of future rainfall {{is required for}} early flood warning, at least 12 to 24 hours in advance, {{as well as for}} alerting operational services, at least 2 or 3 days ahead. Precipitation forecasts are generally provided by numerical weather prediction models (NWP) and their associated uncertainty is generally estimated through an ensemble approach. Precipitation forecasts have also to be adapted to hydrological scales. This study describes an alternative approach to commonly used Limited Area Models. Probabilistic Quantitative Precipitation Forecasts (PQPFs) are provided through an analog sorting technique, which directly links synoptic scale NWP output to catchment scale rainfall probability distributions. A first issue concerns our latest developments to implement a daily version of this technique into operational conditions. It is shown that the obtained PQPFs depend on the meteorological forecasts used for selecting analogous days and that the methodology has to be re-optimized when changing the source of <b>synoptic</b> <b>forecasts,</b> because of the NWP output uncertainties. Secondly, an evaluation of the PQPFs demonstrates that the analog technique performs well for early warning of heavy rainfall events and provides useful information as potential input of a hydrological ensemble prediction system.

To quantify evidence of causality between the passage of the MJO and observed standardised MSLP anomaly patterns, we defined active convection cells around the calculated the observed, aggregated standardised MSLP anomalies. Then stochastically generated null distributions of such anomalies were generated by sampling from Markov Chain Models synthetic time series. Physical connections between MSLP patterns and rainfall are self-evident and do not require inferential testing so we opted for a descriptive approach that quantifies the maximum vertical distance between the unconditional cumulative distribution function (CDF) and the corresponding conditional CDF for a particular phases is sufficient (Maia et al). This measure of distance between cumulative rainfall probabilities indicates positive (negative) divergences that are equivalent to enhanced (suppressed) rainfall associated with that phase. P-values were derived and low p-values indicate strong empirical evidence of causal relationships between MSLP patterns and the passage of the MJO. We do not suggest that all rainfall and MSLP anomalies found here are direct consequences of MJO activity.

Also, few meteorological observations exist in high-elevation areas where Forest Service properties are located. Therefore, a procedure for estimating climatological variables in mountainous areas is needed to apply WEPP in these regions. A physically based approach, using an expanded and improved orographic precipitation model, is being utilized. It will use radiosonde lightning data to estimate historical weather sequences. Climatological sequences estimated at ungaged locations will be represented using stochastic models, similar to the approach used in the existing CLIGEN. By using these stochastic models, WEPP users will be able to synthesize climate sequences for input to WEPP. MCLIGEN will depend on historically based, physically interpolated weather sequences from a mesoscale-climate modeling system which is comprised of four nested layers: 1. an existing <b>synoptic</b> scale <b>forecast</b> model (200 x 300 km) 2. a regional scale slimate model (60 x 60 km) 3. a local scale climate model (10 x 10 km); and 4. a specific point climate predictor, referred to as 2 ̆ 2 ZOOM. 2 ̆ 2 Two additional MCLIGEN components are: 5. a local scalses stochastic climate generator; and 6. a point energy balance snowmelt model Progress made during the reporting period in developing the physically based interpolation climate modeling system stochastic models, and snowpack models is summareized below...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} is unlimitedPerformance of high resolution mesoscale models {{has been in}} a continuous state of refinement since their inception. Mesoscale models have become quite skillful in <b>forecasting</b> <b>synoptic</b> scale events such as mid-latitude cyclones. However, atmospheric forcing becomes a much more complicated process when faced with the challenge of forecasting near topography along the coastline. Phenomena such as gap flows, blocked flow winds and low level stratification become important to predictability at these scales. The problem is further complicated by the dynamics of a frontal passage event. The skill of mesoscale models in predicting these winds is not as well developed. This study examines several forecasts by the Coupled Ocean Atmospheric Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) during frontal passage events for the Winter of 2003 - 2004. An attempt is made to characterize the predictability of the wind speed and direction both before and after frontal passage along the California coast. Synoptic forcing during this time is strong due to the effects of the mid-latitude cyclones propagate across the Pacific. The study's results indicate that the wind field predictability is subject to several consistent errors associated with the passage of fronts over topography. These errors arise due to difficulty in the model capturing weak thermal advection events and topographic wind funneling. The deficiencies in model representation of topography contributes to these errors. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|R
