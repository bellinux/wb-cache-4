5|$|GMAW {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular welding methods, {{especially}} in industrial environments. It is used extensively by the sheet metal industry and, by extension, the automobile industry. There, the method is often used for arc <b>spot</b> <b>welding,</b> thereby replacing riveting or resistance <b>spot</b> <b>welding.</b> It is also popular for automated welding, in which robots handle the workpieces and the welding gun to speed up the manufacturing process. GMAW can be difficult to perform well outdoors, since drafts can dissipate the shielding gas and allow contaminants into the weld; flux cored arc welding is better suited for outdoor use such as in construction. Likewise, GMAW's use of a shielding gas does not lend itself to underwater welding, which is more commonly performed via shielded metal arc welding, flux cored arc welding, or gas tungsten arc welding.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{in order}} to {{minimize}} labor costs in high production manufacturing, industrial welding has become increasingly more automated, most notably with the use of robots in resistance <b>spot</b> <b>welding</b> (especially in the automotive industry) and in arc welding. In robot welding, mechanized devices both hold the material and perform the weld and at first, <b>spot</b> <b>welding</b> was its most common application, but robotic arc welding increases in popularity as technology advances. Other key areas of research and development include the welding of dissimilar materials (such as steel and aluminum, for example) and new welding processes, such as friction stir, magnetic pulse, conductive heat seam, and laser-hybrid welding. Furthermore, progress is desired in making more specialized methods like laser beam welding practical for more applications, such as in the aerospace and automotive industries. Researchers also hope to better understand the often unpredictable properties of welds, especially microstructure, residual stresses, and a weld's tendency to crack or deform.|$|E
5|$|Like <b>spot</b> <b>welding,</b> {{seam welding}} relies on two {{electrodes}} to apply pressure and current to join metal sheets. However, instead of pointed electrodes, wheel-shaped electrodes roll along and often feed the workpiece, {{making it possible}} to make long continuous welds. In the past, this process was used in the manufacture of beverage cans, but now its uses are more limited. Other resistance welding methods include butt welding, flash welding, projection welding, and upset welding.|$|E

40|$|The Volkswagen AG and MSC. Software Corporation have {{developed}} a new <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> element in MSC. Nastran. The new element allows an automatic assembly process for large scale finite element models of bodies in white. Starting point was the <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> philosophy of Volkswagen, {{which is based on}} a one point connection for each <b>spot</b> <b>weld.</b> Due to the need of congruent meshes of the flanges, it requires a large time for the model generation. The new element follows the idea of a connection between shell elements at any point within the elements, not only at element nodes. Therefore, {{there is no need for}} congruency between the part models and each single part can be modeled independently. Furthermore, the part assembly can be done automatically by using the <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> information from CAD systems. In this paper, we describe the traditional and the new <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> modeling process. We demonstrate the capability and accuracy of MSC.

In particular the warping of the receiver rails on the early-models was a defect that occurred in heavily used first-generation M249s. This defect however has been completely eliminated on later models and is no longer present on the current-issue M249, which has reinforced rails and full-length welding rather than <b>spot</b> <b>welding.</b> Also being worked on is replacement of the M249's buttstock with a redesigned adjustable stock.|$|E
5|$|Many welding {{processes}} {{require the use}} of a particular joint design; for example, resistance <b>spot</b> <b>welding,</b> laser beam welding, and electron beam welding are most frequently performed on lap joints. Other welding methods, like shielded metal arc welding, are extremely versatile and can weld virtually any type of joint. Some processes {{can also be used to}} make multipass welds, in which one weld is allowed to cool, and then another weld is performed on top of it. This allows for the welding of thick sections arranged in a single-V preparation joint, for example.|$|E

40|$|The {{resistance}} spot wells are used especially in automotive and airplane industry-for example, a car body contains approximately 5000 <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> and this <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> numbers reach to 15000 {{in a bus}} or coach body according to contraction engineers- because of its simplicity, low cost and of course reliability (which are significant aspects of manufacturing processes) to the other type of joining techniques like rivet joint, bolted joint and bonded joint. In this point, {{it can be said}} that the integrity of the resistance <b>spot</b> <b>welds</b> determines the overall structural rigidity and integrity of the vehicle.

5|$|<b>Spot</b> <b>welding</b> is {{a popular}} {{resistance}} welding method used to join overlapping metal sheets of up to 3mm thick. Two electrodes are simultaneously used to clamp the metal sheets together and to pass current through the sheets. The advantages of the method include efficient energy use, limited workpiece deformation, high production rates, easy automation, and no required filler materials. Weld strength is significantly lower than with other welding methods, making the process suitable for only certain applications. It is used extensively in the automotive industry—ordinary cars can have several thousand spot welds made by industrial robots. A specialized process, called shot welding, {{can be used to}} spot weld stainless steel.|$|E

25|$|The Corsair's {{aerodynamics}} were {{an advance}} over those of contemporary naval fighters. The F4U {{was the first}} U.S. Navy aircraft to feature landing gear that retracted into a fully enclosed wheel well. The landing gear oleo struts — each with their own strut door enclosing them when retracted — rotated through 90° during retraction, with the wheel atop {{the lower end of}} the strut when retracted; a pair of rectangular doors enclosed each wheel well, leaving a streamlined wing. This swiveling, aft-retracting landing gear design was common to the Curtiss P-40 (and its predecessor, the Curtiss P-36), as adopted for the F4U Corsair's main gear and its erstwhile Pacific War counterpart, the Grumman F6F Hellcat. The oil coolers were mounted in the heavily anhedraled center-section of the wings, alongside the supercharger air intakes, and used openings in the leading edges of the wings, rather than protruding scoops. The large fuselage panels were made of aluminum and were attached to the frames with the newly developed technique of <b>spot</b> <b>welding,</b> thus mostly eliminating the use of rivets. While employing this new technology, the Corsair was also the last American-produced fighter aircraft to feature fabric as the skinning for the top and bottom of each outer wing, aft of the main spar and armament bays, and for the ailerons, elevators and rudder. The elevators were also constructed from plywood. The Corsair, even with its streamlining and high speed abilities, could fly slowly enough for carrier landings with full flap deployment of 60°.|$|E
500|$|In {{developing}} the Budd-Michelin railcar, the Budd Company used the formed steel technology {{in which they}} were industry pioneers and solved the most difficult problem in using stainless steel for railcar construction: developing a welding technique that would not compromise the strength and corrosion resistance of the stainless steel. On August 20, 1932, Earl J. Ragsdale, an engineer at the Budd Company, filed a patent application for a [...] "Method and product of electric welding"; on January 16, 1934, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) granted US patent 1,944,106 to the Budd Company. Shotwelding, as Ragsdale termed his method, involved automatic control of the timing of individual spot welds. [...] In <b>spot</b> <b>welding,</b> the two pieces of metal that are to be joined are pressed together with an electrode {{on each side of the}} joint. A very high electric current is passed through the joint and fuses the two pieces of metal together. If a spot weld is heated too long, heat will spread from the weld at a middling temperature that weakens the stainless steel and compromises its corrosion-resistant properties unacceptably; Ragsdale's precisely-timed welds solved the problem. With their patented welding process at the core of stainless steel railcar construction, the cars produced by Budd were a truly unique product.|$|E
40|$|A general {{formulation}} of an analytical procedure {{for the evaluation}} of the elastic plastic behaviour of <b>spot</b> <b>welded</b> joints is presented. The procedure is based on a model of <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> region shaped by a circular plate having variable thickness and having a central rigid nugget representing the <b>spot</b> <b>weld.</b> A closed form solution of the original analytical approach allows to define the displacement of the rigid nugget, when an axial load is applied on the plate, though plasticity and large displacements are present. The so defined <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> region model has to be used as the basis to extend the capability of a <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> element in FE analysis when plasticity and large displacements are in effect. As well as presented in previous works, the procedure is completely general; the accuracy on geometrical parameters dependency is now improved and the strain hardening material characteristics has been introduced. Furthermore the constraints influence of the sheet metal surrounding the spot on elastic plastic behaviour is investigated and evaluated, in order to generalize the plastic contribution on <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> stiffness. Even if the theoretical framework is non-trivial, the {{formulation of}} the proposed procedure is straightforward and it can be easily implemented as an add-on of a FE code.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} different modeling {{strategies for}} <b>spot</b> <b>welds</b> and rivets usable in crash simulations of whole vehicles. The simplified models {{are based on}} solid elements and connector elements. The damage parameters are obtained by simulation of specimen tests containing only one <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> or rivet and conducted under different loading situations (lap-shear, pure tension and peeling) and different loading velocities. <b>Spot</b> <b>welded</b> and riveted component tests {{have been carried out}} and simulated for verifying the calibrated <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> and rivet models. The actual limits are the restrictions of modeling the accurate failure behavior. A <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> model which is calibrated to fail by peel-out or pull-out fracture has no possibility to change the fracture mode to interfacial fracture. By contrast detailed 3 D finite element models with zone specific material properties and advanced micromechanical damage models are able to predict the change of fracture mode from interfaciai to peelout fracture. Of course these detailed models are not applicable to crash simulation of all <b>spot</b> <b>welds</b> of a whole car. But perhaps it is a possibility to model critical <b>spot</b> <b>welds</b> in detail using a multi model coupling for better and more reliable results of <b>spot</b> <b>weld</b> fracture.
