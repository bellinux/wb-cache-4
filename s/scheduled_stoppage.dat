40|$|The {{economic}} viability of on-road wireless charging of electric vehicles (EVs) strongly {{depends on the}} choice of the inductive power transfer (IPT) system configuration (static or dynamic charging), charging power level and the percentage of road coverage of dynamic charging. In this paper, a case study is carried out to determine the expected investment costs involved in installing the on-road charging infrastructure for an electric bus fleet. Firstly, a generic methodology is described to determine the driving range of any EV (including electric buses) with any gross mass and frontal area. A dynamic power consumption model is developed for the EV, taking into account the rolling friction, acceleration, deceleration, aerodynamic drag, regenerative braking and Li-ion battery behavior. Based on the simulation results, the linear dependence of the battery state of charge (SoC) on the distance traveled is proven. Further, the impact of different IPT system parameters on driving range is incorporated. Economic implications of a combination of different IPT system parameters are explored for achieving the required driving range of 400 km, and the cost optimized solution is presented for the case study of an electric bus fleet. It is shown that the choice of charging power level and road coverage are interrelated in the economic context. The {{economic viability}} of reducing the capacity of the on-board battery as a trade-off between higher transport efficiency and larger on-road charging infrastructure is presented. Finally, important considerations, like the number of average running buses, <b>scheduled</b> <b>stoppage</b> time and on-board battery size, that make on-road charging an attractive option are explored. The cost break-up of various system components of the on-road charging scheme is estimated, and the final project cost and parameters are summarized. The specific cost of the wireless on-road charging system is found to be more expensive than the conventional trolley system at this point in time. With decreasing battery costs and a higher number of running buses, a more economically-viable system can be realized. Â© 2016 by the authors...|$|E
40|$|Machine tool {{failures}} in industrial organisations disturb production operations and cause production loss. Predictive maintenance is one approach {{which has been}} successfully applied in some circumstances to allow <b>scheduled</b> production <b>stoppages.</b> It is an approach that reduces the need for reactive maintenance. Predictive maintenance is a tool that has been adopted in some industries to improve operational efficiency and reduce maintenance cost. As a result, monitoring equipment providing information about the systems conditions have evolved rapidly over the last years. Machine tools can change or drift over time and usage in both their mechanical and electrical performance and so reduce in accuracy. This paper proposes a new method for maintaining machine tool accuracy that is complimentary to the predictive maintenance paradigm. This strategy, called predictive calibration, is a methodology {{that depends on the}} prediction of the degradation in machine tool accuracy based upon regular data capture. Although introducing such a strategy will introduce a new cost, the aim is to offset this investment by optimising the operational efficiency and reduce the downtime cost. The main objective is achieved by monitoring the condition of the machine tool by collecting data using quick check measurement techniques or post-process quality data. Calibration should, therefore, be driven by the data measured from either the machine or the part. Building a database of inspection history by measuring the machine on a regular basis with relatively non-invasive methods will make the decision of scheduling extensive calibration accurate better informed process. The project presents a new method of identifying new boundaries of machine tool working tolerance. These boundaries of tolerance reflect the degradation level corresponding to production capacities {{and the quality of the}} part produced. The significance of this work is that machine tool accuracy is critical for high value manufacturing. Over-measuring the machine to ensure accuracy reduces productivity. This piece of work seeks to optimise the frequency of calibration to reduce unnecessary downtime while maintaining the machine at the required tolerance...|$|R
40|$|The use of ultra high {{strength}} steels (UHSS) in {{the automotive industry}} presents a significant opportunity for continued vehicle light-weighting, due to possible strength-to-weight improvements of {{three to four times}} that of conventional sheet steel grades. This performance benefit is achievable whist maintaining most of the advantages of low-cost mass-production associated with the cold stamping of sheet steel for automotive body components. However, the introduction of UHSS can result in significantly increased wear of the stamping tools, which is difficult to predict at the design stage and can lead to unexpected process failure during mass-production. Therefore, {{there is a need to}} be able to monitor and predict the onset of severe wear, such that the best course of condition-based maintenance can be <b>scheduled</b> and unscheduled <b>stoppages</b> due to tool wear eradicated. This paper describes a novel active monitoring system that is being developed by researchers at Deakin University, The Australian National University and Ford Motor Company, Asia Pacific and Africa. The aim of the active monitoring system is to detect the initial onset of a change of state, such as wear, through the measurement of variables such as punch force and audio signals. A semi-industrial stamping process, using a progressive die setup and {{high strength}} steel sheet with hardened tool steel tooling, is the experimental basis for the initial model and system development...|$|R
