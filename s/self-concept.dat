5|$|Women who {{identify}} as lesbian report feeling significantly different and isolated during adolescence. These emotions {{have been cited}} as appearing on average at 15 years old in lesbians and 18 years old in women {{who identify}} as bisexual. On the whole, women tend to work through developing a <b>self-concept</b> internally, or with other women with whom they are intimate. Women also limit who they divulge their sexual identities to, and more often see being lesbian as a choice, as opposed to gay men, who work more externally and see being gay as outside their control.|$|E
5|$|Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book Stories of Resilience in Childhood, {{analyzed}} {{the events in}} Caged Bird to illustrate resiliency in children. Challener states that Angelou's book provides a useful framework for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya face and how a community helps these children succeed as Angelou did. Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has used Caged Bird to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of child development topics such as the development of <b>self-concept</b> and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence. He has called the book a highly effective tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.|$|E
40|$|The {{purposes}} {{of the present study}} was to examine the effects of the teaching that aimed to promote self-learning ability on the <b>self-concepts</b> and the metacognition. The 15 -item <b>self-concepts</b> questionnaire, the 12 -item metacognition questionnaire and the achievement test of arithmetic were administered to 109 (3 classes) fifth grade children. Then the teaching that intended promoting self-learning ability was conducted to 36 children (1 class) during about 2 months. After the teaching, the <b>self-concepts</b> questionnaire, the metacognition questionnaire and the achievement test of arithmetic were administered. The results were as following: (1) Weak correlations were obtained between metacognition and <b>self-concepts,</b> but significant correlations were not obtained between metacognition and achievement test score. (2) The main effects of the teaching on the <b>self-concepts</b> and the metacognition were not obtained enough.

40|$|The present {{doctoral}} thesis {{deals with the}} assessment, structure, and analysis of <b>self-concepts</b> of students for school-related social and learning behavior based on three empirical studies. The first study examines <b>self-concepts</b> of fourth graders and reveals that children at this age have specific <b>self-concepts</b> that are mainly valid and closely related to grades in mathematics and German. In addition, regression analysis indicate that good grades in mathematics are associated with high <b>self-concepts</b> in cooperation, self-control, endurance, concentration and diligence in learning. Moreover, good grades in German {{can be explained by}} high <b>self-concepts</b> in cooperation and concentration. The second study investigates gender differences in <b>self-concepts</b> for school-related social and learning behavior as well as in grades in mathematics and German. Boys score lower in almost all facets of school-related social and learning behavior and achieve lower grades in German than girls. Furthermore, both grades in mathematics and German are linked with high <b>self-concepts</b> in cooperation, endurance and concentration as well as with high class average grades in these two subjects. However, low assessments in care for learning and a migration background {{have a negative impact on}} these two grades. The third study analyses specific relations between reactive/proactive aggression and social-emotional skills in <b>self-concepts</b> of students. Regression analysis indicate that both types of aggression can be explained by low perceived skills (self-control, self-assertion). In addition, reactive aggression is associated with a high perceived empathy...|$|R
5|$|Drugs, devices, surgery, {{and other}} {{interventions}} exist to help men achieve erection and ejaculation. Although male fertility is reduced, many men with SCI can still father children, particularly with medical interventions. Women's fertility {{is not usually}} affected, although precautions must be taken for safe pregnancy and delivery. People with SCI need to take measures during sexual activity to deal with SCI effects such as weakness and movement limitations, and to avoid injuries such as skin damage in areas of reduced sensation. Education and counseling about sexuality {{is an important part}} of SCI rehabilitation but is often missing or insufficient. Rehabilitation for children and adolescents aims to promote healthy development of sexuality and includes education for them and their families. Culturally inherited biases and stereotypes negatively affect people with SCI, particularly when held by professional caregivers. Body image and other insecurities affect sexual function, and have profound repercussions on self-esteem and <b>self-concept.</b> SCI causes difficulties in romantic partnerships, due to problems with sexual function and to other stresses introduced by the injury and disability, but many of those with SCI have fulfilling relationships and marriages. Relationships, self-esteem, and reproductive ability are all aspects of sexuality, which encompasses not just sexual practices but a complex array of factors: cultural, social, psychological, and emotional influences.|$|E
25|$|More recently, modern {{portfolio}} {{theory has}} been used to model the <b>self-concept</b> in social psychology. When the self attributes comprising the <b>self-concept</b> constitute a well-diversified portfolio, then psychological outcomes {{at the level of the}} individual such as mood and self-esteem should be more stable than when the <b>self-concept</b> is undiversified.

They deploy defense mechanisms to achieve this. He describes two mechanisms: distortion and denial.

40|$|The {{purposes}} {{of the present study}} were to explore the characteristics of the <b>self-concepts</b> and the metacognition in childhood, and to compare the developmental differences of <b>self-concepts</b> and the metacognition between the school-children and the students. The results indicated that the <b>self-concepts</b> develop from the optimistic self-esteem to the self-consciousness for the transformation of self, and that metacognitive abilities develop in the factors of activities for understanding, activities of self-evaluation, and activities of self-learning. Also, the results indicated that the correlations between the <b>self-concepts</b> and the metacognition in the students were higher than the school-children.

40|$|Dimensional {{comparison}} theory (DCT; Möller & Marsh, 2013) {{assumes that}} students compare their academic achievement intraindividually across domains to form domain-specific <b>self-concepts.</b> Upward dimensional comparisons {{are believed to}} lead to lower <b>self-concepts</b> in the worse-off domain, while downward dimensional comparisons should lead to higher <b>self-concepts</b> in the better-off domain. Furthermore, DCT assumes {{the net effect of}} upward and downward dimensional comparisons to be beneficial to the self. To test these assumptions, 3 experiments and 2 field studies were conducted investigating the relative effects of upward and downward dimensional comparisons as well as their net effect. In Studies 1 (N = 149), 2 (N = 150) and 3 (N = 300), participants were asked to infer <b>self-concepts</b> of fictitious students after receiving experimentally manipulated information about their achievements in 2 domains, whereas participants in Studies 4 (N = 2, 268) and 5 (N = 20, 662) assessed their own <b>self-concepts</b> in German and mathematics. In all studies, downward dimensional comparisons resulted in higher <b>self-concepts,</b> whereas upward dimensional comparisons led to lower <b>self-concepts.</b> The net effect of dimensional comparisons was always found to be not statistically different from zero. The findings therefore support the central prediction of DCT on the discreteness of the effects of upward and downward dimensional comparisons, yet do not support the assumed positivity of their net effect. Furthermore, results indicate the effect patterns to be rather universal as they were stable across different samples, domains, achievement situations, research designs, and types of assessment...|$|R

25|$|Developing {{a sexual}} <b>self-concept</b> is an {{important}} developmental step during adolescence. This is when adolescents {{try to make sense}} and organize their sexual experiences so that they understand the structures and underlying motivations for their sexual behavior. This sexual <b>self-concept</b> helps adolescents organize their past experiences, but also gives them information to draw on for their current and future sexual thoughts and experiences. Sexual <b>self-concept</b> affects sexual behavior for both men and women, but it also affects relationship development for women. Development of one’s sexual <b>self-concept</b> can occur even before sexual experiences begin. An important part of sexual <b>self-concept</b> is sexual esteem, which includes how one evaluates their sexuality (including their thoughts, emotions and sexual activities). Another aspect is sexual anxiety; this includes one’s negative evaluations of sex and sexuality. Sexual <b>self-concept</b> is not only developed from sexual experiences; both girls and boys can learn from a variety of social interactions such as their family, sexual education programs, depictions in the media and from their friends and peers. Girls with a positive self-schema {{are more likely to be}} liberal in their attitudes about sex, are more likely to view themselves as passionate and open to sexual experience and are more likely to rate sexual experiences as positive. Their views towards relationships show that they place high importance on romance, love and intimacy. Girls who have a more negative view often say they feel self-conscious about their sexuality and view sexual encounters more negatively. The sexual <b>self-concept</b> of girls with more negative views are highly influenced by other people; those of girls who hold more positive views are less so.|$|E
