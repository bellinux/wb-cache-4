50|$|The <b>silver-banded</b> whiting, <b>Sillago</b> argentifasciata, is a {{narrowly}} distributed {{species of}} inshore marine fish of the smelt whiting family Sillaginidae that inhabits the coastline {{of a single}} province within the Philippines. The species' taxonomic status is still marginally uncertain, with the last major review of sillaginid fish by McKay proposing S. argentifasciata is a senior synonym of a related species, S. ingenuua. The species {{takes its name from}} a brilliant silvery strip running laterally across its body.|$|R
