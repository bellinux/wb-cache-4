This study explores {{the extent to}} which multinational enterprises (MNEs) from an emerging economy, South Korea, transfer reward <b>and</b> <b>compensation</b> practices from business headquarters to a transitional economy, China and the determining factors for transfer. Using a qualitative approach to analysing 10 South Korean MNEs in China, this study reveals that the sample companies adopt home-oriented focal reward <b>and</b> <b>compensation</b> <b>policies</b> <b>and</b> practices (including base pay and performance-based pay) and an integrative approach to peripheral components (including allowances and benefits) for expatriates. However, the companies adopt an integrative approach to focal components of reward <b>and</b> <b>compensation</b> <b>and</b> a localized approach to peripheral components for host country nationals (HCNs). These findings indicate that Korean MNEs adopt different approaches to reward <b>and</b> <b>compensation</b> for expatriates <b>and</b> HCNs, as well as to focal and peripheral components of reward <b>and</b> <b>compensation</b> practices. The transfer of reward <b>and</b> <b>compensation</b> is due to the dominance effect resulting {{from the fact that the}} home economy is relatively more advanced than the host economy.

If done successfully, the company can enjoy a period of sustained competitive advantage. There are many components to this question of organization. They include, but are not limited to, the company’s formal reporting structure, management control systems <b>and</b> <b>compensation</b> <b>policies.</b> Formal reporting structures are simply a description of who in the firm reports to whom. Management control systems include both formal and informal means to make sure that managers’ decisions align with a firm’s strategies. Formal control systems can consist of budgeting and reporting activities that keep top management informed of decisions made by employee’s lower down in the firm. Informal controls can include a company’s culture and encouraging employees to monitor each other. Firms incentivize their employees to behave a desired way through <b>compensation</b> <b>policies.</b> These policies can include bonuses, stocks or salary increases but can also include non-monetary incentives such as additional vacation days or a larger office. These components of organization are known at complementary capabilities and resources because alone they do not provide much value. However, in combination with a firm’s other resources and capabilities, it can result in sustained competitive advantage. Without the correct organization, even firms with valuable, rare and costly to imitate resources and capabilities can suffer competitive disadvantage (Barney & Hesterly, 2011).|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how various agency frictions affect corporate financing, capital budgeting, managerial <b>compensation</b> <b>and</b> investment in dynamic settings. In the internal capital budgeting process, the agency issues considered are (i) the division manager privately observes project arrival and quality, and (ii) he can divert allo-cated capital. The optimal capital budgeting <b>and</b> <b>compensation</b> <b>policies</b> are jointly designed to mitigate agency costs that are endogenously determined. When the di-vision’s financial slack is low, positive NPV investments are possibly forgone and manager’s pay-performance sensitivity is kept small. When the division’s financial slack is high, projects are funded more efficiently and steeper incentives are provided. In {{the process of}} external financing, the key friction considered is that the agent has persistent private information about firm performance. In the optimal contract, the firm is financed by outside equity and a credit line contingent on compliance with a cash flow covenant. The agent is compensated via a combination of equity and stock options. As the level of persistence increases, the agent holds less equity and more stock options; the investors hold more equity. Investment is possibly efficient in the constrained firm and is varying with cash flow in the unconstrained firm. iv I dedicate my dissertation to my parents and my wife. v Contents Abstract i...|$|R
40|$|Migrant workers’ buying {{houses in}} cities {{can not only}} help {{to reduce the number}} of unsold houses but also improve the {{efficiency}} of the use of rural residential lands. A framework is constructed to study how individual resource endowment <b>and</b> the <b>compensation</b> <b>policy</b> of quitting rural residential land act on migrant workers’ willingness to buy houses in cities. The paper adopts the logistic regression model with the data collected from 410 migrant workers in Xi’an. The results can be drawn as follows: firstly, migrant workers’ desire for buying houses in cities has a close relationship with their individual resource endowment; secondly, there is a gap between the existing <b>compensation</b> <b>policy</b> <b>and</b> migrant workers’ actual preference for the <b>compensation</b> <b>policies.</b> Thirdly, the existing <b>compensation</b> <b>policy</b> cannot fully exert its impact. As a result, when migrant workers are allowed to choose their most preferred policies in light of their own conditions, both the policy and resource effect will become more remarked. Thus, the design of <b>compensation</b> <b>policies</b> for quitting rural residential land should take full account of migrant workers’ individual resource endowments in order to provide them with selective compensation mechanisms. The conclusion provides a policy reference for cities where the house prices are close to that of Xi’an (11, 000 yuan/square m) ...|$|R

40|$|This article {{examines}} the combined impact of the employment guarantee for graduates <b>and</b> public sector <b>compensation</b> <b>policies</b> on the Egyptian labor market. Besides contributing to an unsustainable rate {{of growth in the}} government labor force, these policies have encouraged queuing for government jobs, contributed to high graduate unemployment rates, and reduced the employment of graduates in the private sector. Despite substantial wage erosion in the public sector in recent years, government wages, when appropriately corrected for observed heterogeneity and sample selection, are on a par with, or higher than, private sector wages, especially for graduates. When combined with the more desirable nonwage aspects of government jobs, these compensation levels explain the attractiveness of public sector employment to graduates. Government pay scales are especially advantageous to female secondary school graduates, who appear to face considerable discrimination in the private sector. The public sector’s role in shaping labor market outcomes through its hiring <b>and</b> <b>compensation</b> <b>policies</b> takes on special importance in Egypt because of the country’s long-standing policy of guaranteeing employment in the public sector for all graduates of secondary and postsecondary institutions. When the policy was first instituted in the early 1960 s, its impact was relatively limited because of the small number of eligible graduates, but, over time, it has had major consequences for the Egyptian labor market and economy. The employment guarantee fueled the growth in demand for secondary and university education, which has, in turn, led to rapid growth in public sector employment and in the number of aspirants to such employment. When the growth of the public sector wage bill became unsustainable in the early 1980 s, the government responded by eroding real public sector wages and extending the waiting period for government jobs. Despite these measures, long queues for government jobs indicate that rents received by public sector workers have not dissipated. Although the lifetime job security and many of the generous benefit...|$|R
