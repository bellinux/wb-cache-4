5|$|Its {{by-product}} status {{means that}} indium production is {{constrained by the}} amount of sulfidic zinc (and copper) ores extracted each year. Therefore, its availability needs to be discussed in terms of supply potential. The supply potential of a by-product is defined as that amount which is economically extractable from its host materials per year under current market conditions (i.e. technology and price). Reserves and resources are not relevant for by-products, since they cannot be extracted independently from the main-products. Recent estimates put the supply potential of indium at a minimum of 1,300 t/yr from sulfidic zinc ores and 20 t/yr from sulfidic copper ores. These figures are significantly greater than current production (655 t in 2016). Thus, major future increases in the by-product production of indium will be possible without <b>significant</b> <b>increases</b> in production costs or price. The average indium price in 2016 was $US240/kg, down from $US705/kg in 2014.|$|E
40|$|Aim of work :- This {{research}} aims {{to study}} some cases of medical malpractice and provides guidance for medical persons to minimize or even avoid medical malpractice among Yemenis. Subjects and Methods:- This first study in Yemen {{was done on}} hundred cases of medical malpractice during surgery that were collected randomly through {{the last ten years}} (1996 - 2005) from many places in Yemen. All cases were aging from 3 to 70 years old. The gender of patient was 54 males and 46 females. Results:-This study showed highly <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> of number of cases between ages 21 - 30, 41 - 50 and 51 - 60 in both sexes as compared to other groups of age, while ages 11 - 20 and 31 - 40 showed <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> in number of malpractice cases versus age 61 - 70 years. No significant difference between females and males among the studied cases. There was very highly statistical <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> of number of malpractices that done by one physician when compared to that done by two or three physicians. There was very highly <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> in number of malpractice cases in public hospital versus other hospitals and in private hospitals versus academic hospitals. Positive cases of medical malpractice were very highly significantly decreased as compared to negative one in public and private hospitals & no significant difference between positive and negative cases in academic hospitals. There was very highly <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> in number of malpractice cases among specialists as compare to university staff and consultant. There was no statistical significant difference between university staff and consultants. There was also very highly <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> in number of negative cases among university staff and specialists, but <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> of negative cases as compared to positive cases was seen among consultants. This study proved that the general surgery showed very highly <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> in number of malpractice cases versus other groups.

It was demonstrated very highly <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> in number of malpractice cases during intra-operative and post-operative stages versus other stages.

5|$|The Deputy Chief of the Air Staff {{position}} that Bostock occupied at {{the outbreak of}} World War II was a new one that initially augmented, and later supplanted, an existing Assistant Chief of the Air Staff role. Unlike the Assistant Chief, the Deputy {{had the authority to}} act in place of the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) if required. This increased status saw Bostock given a place on Australia's Joint Planning Committee. He was the RAAF's delegate to a defence conference in Singapore in October 1940, where the Australian contingent found the local forces ill-prepared for an attack by the Japanese, and recommended <b>significant</b> <b>increases</b> in air capability, both in Australia and the Pacific Islands, to meet the threat. Bostock rose rapidly in rank during this period, becoming acting air commodore on 1June 1940 and substantive air vice marshal on 1October 1941.

On his return to Australia in January 1940, he was appointed Staff Officer Plans at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne.

The Australian contingent found the local forces ill-prepared for an attack by the Japanese and recommended <b>significant</b> <b>increases</b> in air capability, both in Australia and the Pacific Islands, to meet the threat. Hely was promoted to temporary wing commander the following January, and was the ranking Air Force delegate at a series of staff talks in Batavia and Singapore regarding the defence of the Dutch East Indies. He became Director of Operations at RAAF Headquarters in August. His promotion to acting group captain was announced on 17February 1942. Two days later, the Japanese bombed Darwin, Northern Territory; Hely circulated a memo early the next month to all commands on the lessons learnt from the raid. He was posted to Darwin in May to join North-Western Area headquarters as senior air staff officer, and was granted the temporary rank of group captain in January 1943. Hely returned to RAAF Headquarters in March to become Director of Air Staff Plans.|$|E

Eight clinically healthy newborn calves were considered as controls. Diagnosis of AKAV was confirmed using a competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test. Results: Results show that all affected calves were found seropositive. Furthermore, a <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> in total leukocyte count in diseased calves due to a <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> in the absolute lymphocyte number indicated in affected calves than in controls. Moreover, a <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> in sedimentation rate of erythrocytes was also encountered in diseased calves than in controls.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the hyper excitability caused by administration of Fluoxetine which is a highly prescribed antidepressant belonging to a Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor class. Behavioral activities were observed on Cage Crossing, Forced Swim Test, Open Field Test and Head Dip Test. These activities were observed on rodents after 60 days of oral Fluoxetine treatment and were compared with untreated control animals. The results clearly showed that Fluoxetine caused <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> in number of head dips in head dip test, <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> in number of cage crosses in cage crossing, <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> in number of squares crossed in an open field apparatus and <b>significant</b> <b>increase</b> in struggling time in forced swim test. Thus overall results indicated hyper excitability in treated animals. Hence, outcomes suggest that Fluoxetine can lead to hyper excitation in behavior and produce anxiety and therefore strongly implies that Fluoxetine use may also require an anxiolytic drug to antagonize this hyper excitability...|$|R
