This made the tuning coil act as an impedance matching transformer (in an autotransformer connection) in addition to providing the tuning function. The antenna's low resistance was increased (transformed) by a factor equal to the square of the turns ratio (the ratio of the number of turns the antenna was connected to, to the total number of turns of the coil), to match the resistance across the tuned circuit. In the [...] "two-slider" [...] circuit, popular during the wireless era, both the antenna and the detector circuit were attached to the coil with <b>sliding</b> <b>contacts,</b> allowing (interactive) adjustment of both the resonant frequency and the turns ratio. Alternatively a multiposition switch was used to select taps on the coil. These controls were adjusted until the station sounded loudest in the earphone.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the usage of}} acoustic emission measurement in monitoring <b>sliding</b> <b>contact</b> behaviour in mechanical face seal. The mechanical face seal works normally in boundary lubrication region.

These kind of situations can appear in failures of seals. Usually the cooling liquid in mechanical face seal is water. In high temperatures the <b>sliding</b> <b>contact</b> becomes unstable because of cavitation in the lubrication region. The cavitation is result of the boiling of the lubricant in the contact.

50|$|Coilguns {{generally}} {{consist of}} one or more coils arranged along a barrel, so the path of the accelerating projectile lies along the central axis of the coils. The coils are switched on and off in a precisely timed sequence, causing the projectile to be accelerated quickly along the barrel via magnetic forces. Coilguns are distinct from railguns, as the direction of acceleration in a railgun is at right angles to the central axis of the current loop formed by the conducting rails. In addition, railguns usually require the use of <b>sliding</b> <b>contacts</b> to pass a large current through the projectile or sabot but coilguns do not necessarily require <b>sliding</b> <b>contacts.</b> While some simple coilgun concepts can use ferromagnetic projectiles or even permanent magnet projectiles, most designs for high velocities actually incorporate a coupled coil as part of the projectile.|$|E

The disadvantage of this type is that the contact usually short-circuits one or more turns. These turns act like a single-turn short-circuited transformer secondary winding; the large currents induced in them cause power losses.|$|E

The contact resistance as a function of applied contact current, of <b>contact</b> <b>sliding</b> speed and of contact pressure has been measured in order to arrive at some definite conclusions in regard to obtaining a reproducible low loss contact with a long operating life. The <b>sliding</b> <b>contact</b> resistance was periodic in nature, the comparison of contact resistance was by their average values rather than their peak values; an integrator was employed to facilitate the averaging operation. The magnitude of <b>sliding</b> <b>contact</b> resistance was found to be approximately one-thousandth of the normal resistance at liquid air temperature. The main cause of sliding resistance was considered to be an effect of surface eddy current which quenched each microscopic contact.

50|$|User-accessible rotary potentiometers can {{be fitted}} with a switch which {{operates}} usually at the anti-clockwise extreme of rotation. Before digital electronics became the norm such a component was used to allow radio and television receivers and other equipment to be switched on at minimum volume with an audible click, then the volume increased, by turning a knob. Multiple resistance elements can be ganged together with their <b>sliding</b> <b>contacts</b> on the same shaft, for example, in stereo audio amplifiers for volume control. In other applications, such as domestic light dimmers, the normal usage pattern is best satisfied if the potentiometer remains set at its current position, so the switch is operated by a push action, alternately on and off, by axial presses of the knob.|$|E
50|$|A metal disc {{containing}} {{a set of}} concentric rings of openings is fixed to an insulating disc, which is rigidly fixed to the shaft.

The metal sheet is connected to a source of electric current, and each contact is connected to a separate electrical sensor. The metal pattern is designed so that each possible position of the axle creates a unique binary code in which some of the contacts {{are connected to the}} current source (i.e. switched on) and others are not (i.e. switched off).|$|E
50|$|Though gold is {{attacked}} by free chlorine, its good conductivity and general {{resistance to oxidation}} and corrosion in other environments (including resistance to non-chlorinated acids) has led to its widespread industrial use in the electronic era as a thin-layer coating on electrical connectors, thereby ensuring good connection.

The benefit of using gold over other connector metals such as tin in these applications has been debated; gold connectors are often criticized by audio-visual experts as unnecessary for most consumers and seen as simply a marketing ploy.

The modular device can be attached to a PHANTOM haptic interface and generates tactile sensations by actuating a ball positioned under the user’s index finger. Specifications for the device and mechanical design considerations are presented. Integration of the slip display, PHANTOM, and a virtual environment results in a system capable of generating both tactile and kinesthetic haptic sensations. We also present the results of two psychophysical experiments, detection of slip angle and slip velocity variation, on human perception of <b>sliding</b> <b>contact.</b> These experiments demonstrate that, despite design and manufacturing tolerance limitations, the functional performance of the device is sufficient for realistic display of <b>sliding</b> <b>contact.</b> ...|$|R

5000|$|Long {{after the}} {{original}} Faraday disc had been abandoned as a practical generator, a modified version combining the magnet and disc in a single rotating part (the rotor) was developed. Sometimes the name homopolar generator is reserved for this configuration. One of the earliest patents on the general type of homopolar generators was attained by A. F. Delafield, [...] Other early patents for homopolar generators were awarded to S. Z. De Ferranti and C. Batchelor separately. Nikola Tesla {{was interested in the}} Faraday disc and conducted work with homopolar generators, and eventually patented an improved version of the device in [...] Tesla's [...] "Dynamo Electric Machine" [...] patent describes an arrangement of two parallel discs with separate, parallel shafts, joined like pulleys by a metallic belt. Each disc had a field that was the opposite of the other, so that the flow of current was from the one shaft to the disc edge, across the belt to the other disc edge and to the second shaft. This would have greatly reduced the frictional losses caused by <b>sliding</b> <b>contacts</b> by allowing both electrical pickups to interface with the shafts of the two disks rather than at the shaft and a high-speed rim. Later, patents were awarded to C. P. Steinmetz and E. Thomson for their work with homopolar generators.

Much of the development done in homopolar generators was patented by J. E. Noeggerath and R. Eickemeyer.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary goal}} of {{cartilage}} tissue engineering is to recapitulate the functional properties and structural features of native articular cartilage. While {{there has been some}} success in generating near-native compressive properties, the tensile properties of cell-seeded constructs remain poor, and key features of cartilage, including inhomogeneity and anisotropy, are generally absent in these engineered constructs. Therefore, in an attempt to instill these hallmark properties of cartilage in engineered cell-seeded constructs, we designed and characterized a novel <b>sliding</b> <b>contact</b> bioreactor to recapitulate the mechanical stimuli arising from physiologic joint loading (two contacting cartilage layers). Finite element modeling of this bioreactor system showed that tensile strains were direction-dependent, while both tensile strains and fluid motion were depth-dependent and highest in the region closest to the <b>contact</b> surface. Short-term <b>sliding</b> <b>contact</b> of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) -seeded agarose improved chondrogenic gene expression in a manner dependent on both the axial strain applied and transforming growth factor-β supplementation.
