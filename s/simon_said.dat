5|$|The {{music of}} So Beautiful or So What {{features}} West African blues-inspired guitar playing, Indian-style percussion, and experimentation with samples, which ranged from {{an excerpt from}} a 1941 sermon to nighttime ambience in Kenya. The songs were recorded with little bass but with a very large presence of bells. Much of Simon's lyrics touch on themes of spirituality and mortality, which <b>Simon</b> <b>said</b> was unintentional and resulted naturally in his songwriting process for the album.|$|E
25|$|With {{the success}} of the Captain America character, <b>Simon</b> <b>said</b> he felt that Goodman was not paying the pair the promised {{percentage}} of profits, and so sought work {{for the two of them}} at National Comics Publications (later renamed DC Comics). Kirby and Simon negotiated a deal that would pay them a combined $500 a week, as opposed to the $75 and $85 they respectively earned at Timely. The pair feared Goodman would not pay them if he found they were moving to National, but many people knew of their plan, including Timely editorial assistant, Stan Lee. When Goodman eventually discovered it, he told Simon and Kirby to leave after finishing work on Captain America Comics #10.|$|E

500|$|The duo were {{disappointed}} with their performance, particularly Garfunkel, {{who felt that}} he sang poorly. <b>Simon</b> <b>said</b> {{that he did not}} immediately realize the magnitude of the event: [...] "I didn't get what had happened– how big it was– until I went home, turned on the television and saw it on all the news ... and later that night on the front pages of all the newspapers. Then I got it." ...|$|E
500|$|Simon {{financed the}} {{recording}} of So Beautiful or So What himself after being released from his 30-year record contract with Warner Bros. Records. After the recording sessions were finished, he signed a deal with Concord Music Group to distribute the album. <b>Simon</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "It's the best work I've done in 20 years." [...] The cover art, titled [...] "DNA Mutation", was designed by visual artist and NASA systems engineer Sven Geier.|$|E
500|$|The show's creators {{are also}} willing to kill off major {{character}}s, so that viewers cannot {{assume that a}} given character will survive simply because of a starring role or popularity among fans. In {{response to a question}} on why a certain character had to die, David <b>Simon</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "We are not selling hope, or audience gratification, or cheap victories with this show. The Wire is making an argument about what institutions—bureaucracies, criminal enterprises, the cultures of addiction, raw capitalism even—do to individuals. It is not designed purely as an entertainment. It is, I'm afraid, a somewhat angry show".|$|E

500|$|The song's lyrics thematically {{relate to}} {{a fear of}} aging and leaving behind the [...] "boldness of youth," [...] {{according}} to Sullivan. Holden considered it a story of an everyman pondering the uncertainty of life whilst navigating his high school yearbook. Rolling Stone John Mcalley too found it an everyman battling {{the fact that his}} [...] "days have become defined by their limitations and dogged ordinariness." [...] For The Rhythm of the Saints, Simon was inspired by poet Derek Walcott, and would base first-draft lyrics on his poems. Simon attempted to match the rhythmic quality of the composition with his lyrics, whether that meant a lyric was meaningless or not. A lyric relating to [...] "the cross is in the ballpark," [...] for example, has no meaning; <b>Simon</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I found [...] to be a satisfying rhythmic phrase against the drums." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked if}} she viewed Ingrid as evil, Lawless said {{that she did not}} play the {{character}} as a villain, and instead interpreted her as a [...] "someone who must get what she wants" [...] even if it harms others. Despite this separation, she did acknowledge that Marbug is one of the series' antagonists. She referenced Ingrid as a [...] "female Dracula", and <b>Simon</b> <b>said</b> that the character was similar to a [...] "dark goddess figure". During the development of the character as [...] "the biggest, baddest bitch in the world," [...] Lawless requested that Ingrid was also a [...] "very constructive force" [...] with a [...] "great goodness" [...] and a [...] "great weakness" [...] for evil. While Lawless felt that her character was incapable of love, she believed that Ingrid feels emotional conflict while performing evil deeds, and bases her decisions on appealing to the greater good.|$|E
500|$|... "The Late Great Johnny Ace" [...] was {{interrupted}} when an audience member {{ran to the}} stage and shouted at Simon: [...] "I {{need to talk to}} you!" [...] The man was carried away by security, and Simon finished the song. The incident provoked associations to the song's lyrics, in which Simon speaks as a first-person narrator concerning the deaths of Johnny Ace, John F. Kennedy and John Lennon. Lennon's murder by an obsessed fan had taken place less than a year previously, not far from the concert site. Despite this association, <b>Simon</b> <b>said</b> that he was not afraid of any on-stage incidents. In May 1982 as a guest on Late Night with David Letterman, he explained that while {{it is not unusual for}} fans, for example, to jump onto the stage with flowers, this action was new to him, but also felt that the man simply appeared intoxicated. His greater concern was that the song's premiere was ruined.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{this version}} was disputed by Lillard's daughter, Valdeenia Lillard <b>Simons.</b> She <b>said</b> {{that her father}} {{told her that he}} was telling jokes to a friend in the hall outside Palmer's office and, Palmer, who had been reading, joined them. When Lillard reached the punch line, Palmer, {{laughing}} heartily, slapped Lillard on the back with the hand holding the heavy book he had been reading. A few days later, Lillard told Palmer that his hearing seemed better. Palmer then decided to explore manipulation as an expansion of his magnetic healing practice. <b>Simons</b> <b>said</b> [...] "the compact was that if they can make [...] it, then they both would share.

500|$|Regarding {{the acting}} and the characters, Sims and Monahan praised Middleton's performance. By contrast, Crichlow's role was {{considered}} to be repetitive. Monahan stated she just wailed, and Parker called it [...] "a harrowing performance with no arc or resolutions, just sheer fear and distress." [...] Lambie said: [...] "If there's a criticism to be levelled at the first two-thirds of White Bear, it's that Victoria's carried helplessly along by events." [...] <b>Simon</b> <b>said</b> Crichlow's potential was wasted because of the script. Jeffery criticized the fact [...] "Victoria maintains one emotional level across the episode ... she's tearful, panicked and terrified throughout", but he remarked it was not Crichlow's fault, while praising Middleton and Smiley as [...] "uniformly excellent." [...] Cocks was more favorable, praising Crichlow's commitment to her performance. He also attributed to her performance [...] "one of the episode's greatest accomplishments ... how much it makes audience members feel as though they are in the position of [...] ". Edwards asserted she gave a [...] " [...] performance" [...] that is [...] "an excellent, convincing portrayal of a frightened, confused woman".|$|E
500|$|On November 11, 2004, it was {{reported}} that a number of the inflatables had been stolen from Burger King roofs nationwide. Burger King chief marketing officer Russ Klein said, [...] "As to the motives behind these apparent 'spongenappings', we can only speculate. We did receive one ransom note related to an inflatable SpongeBob disappearance in Minnesota." [...] The chain offered a year's supply of Whopper sandwiches as a reward for information leading to the return of inflatables stolen in November. One was found attached to a railing at the football-field 50-yard line at an Iowa college, and another under a bed in Virginia. A ransom note was found for a third: [...] "We have SpongeBob. Give us 10 Krabby Patties, fries, and milkshakes." [...] Steven Simon and Conrad (C.J.) Mercure Jr. were arrested after stealing an inflatable from a Burger King in St. Mary's County, Maryland. While facing up to 18 months in jail and a $500 fine, Simon and Mercure said they were proud of what they did; <b>Simon</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Once we got caught by the police, we were like, now we can tell everybody." [...] The following year Burger King took [...] "extra security precautions", when Stormtroopers from George Lucas' Star Wars guarded the delivery of Star Wars toys to a Burger King in North Hollywood.|$|E
500|$|... "Bop Gun" [...] {{marked the}} first episode in its new time slot on Thursdays at 10 p.m., occupying a period {{previously}} filled by L.A. Law. The show previously aired 9 p.m. on Wednesdays, where it was regularly defeated in the ratings by the ABC comedy Home Improvement. [...] "Bop Gun" [...] was written by David Mills and David Simon based on a story by Fontana. It was directed by Stephen Gyllenhaal, a feature director then-best known for such films as Waterland (1992) and A Dangerous Woman (1993). It was the first television script written by Mills, who previously worked as a reporter and became friends with Simon while studying journalism at the University of Maryland, College Park. Mills said of [...] "Bop Gun", [...] "That script inspired me to quit journalism. It was a golden opportunity, even though I didn't know what I was doing. I developed bad habits as a newspaper feature writer. I would always stretch a project to fill the available time." [...] "Bop Gun" [...] served as a departure from previous Homicide: Life on the Street episodes by focusing more strongly on a murder victim, {{rather than on the}} detectives. Simon felt the script's dialogue, particularly the detectives' use of dark humor as a coping mechanism for dealing with the horrors of the homicide unit, were faithful to reality. He particularly cited the scene in which Felton angers Ellison by talking excitedly about how much overtime he expected to get. <b>Simon</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "That's a conversation that would happen. It would happen in any homicide unit in America, and when I saw it actually being acted out I got a real kick in the pants because I thought, 'Wherever there are homicide detectives watching this, they're cracking up because they know how true it is.'" ...|$|E

Shortly before its release, Ed <b>Simons</b> <b>said</b> to Muzik that [...] "nobody from the dance world {{has come up with}} an album to reflect these times. Why is that? Why is it left to a group like Oasis to express the way that young people {{want to go out and}} get battered every weekend? That's what The Chemical Brothers are about".|$|R

500|$|As Simon explained, the {{foundation}} aims to [...] "rescue dogs" [...] and [...] "train {{them to be}} service dogs, [...] people with disabilities," [...] primarily the deaf. It also provides free veterinary surgeries to pets belonging to low-income families, and trains dogs to help soldiers returning from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan deal with post-traumatic stress disorder. <b>Simon</b> <b>said</b> the money he used was [...] "well spent just for the pleasure it gives me." [...] The training program has a 20% success rate, {{because many of the}} rescued dogs [...] "have physical and psychological problems" [...] but the dogs who cannot be trained are put up for adoption. The foundation is non-profit, does not accept public donations, but does receive some federal government funding due to a bill written and passed by Senator Al Franken. In 2011, Simon established and self-funded the Sam Simon Foundation Feeding Families program, a food truck which delivers vegan food to low-income families; the program helps feed some 200 families per week. He donated an undisclosed sum to the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society in 2012 for the purpose of purchasing another vessel for their fleet, the , which was unveiled in December 2012. Simon was also a board member for Save the Children, and hosted the largest annual fundraiser for PETA, who named him an Honorary Director and their Norfolk, Virginia headquarters building after him. Simon has stated that animal rights charities have been his main target for donations, over other causes like human disease and environmental damage, because [...] "your money can bring success" [...] with visible results. Simon stated in 2011 that there is [...] "nothing [...] more pleasure than" [...] helping others via his charities, and gave away most of his fortune.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Simon</b> <b>said</b> Captain America was a {{consciously}} political creation; he and Kirby were morally repulsed by {{the actions}} of Nazi Germany in the years leading up to the United States' involvement in World War II and felt war was inevitable: [...] "The opponents to the war were all quite well organized. We wanted to have our say too." ...|$|E
2500|$|The paper [...] "caused an uproar", {{according}} to Pamela McCorduck. The AI community's response was derisive and personal.

5000|$|Discussing Roxy's {{friendship}} with Alfie Moon (Shane Richie), Simons told Soaplife that although Roxy flirts with Alfie, {{she would not}} steal him from his wife Kat (Jessie Wallace). Roxy {{is the only person}} to ask Alfie how he feels {{after the death of his}} son Tommy Moon, which <b>Simons</b> <b>said</b> showed how close Roxy and Alfie have become as friends.

5000|$|After the {{television}} broadcast, writing in The Daily Telegraph, Jake Wallis <b>Simons</b> <b>said</b> of the film, [...] "The {{problem was that}} this was a story in which nothing very dramatic happened.

[...] He added, [...] "Izzard did his best, but neither story nor script worked in his favour.." [...] concluding: [...] "Overall, it all felt a bit worthy.
