5|$|In {{the first}} stratum, a {{courtyard}} surrounded by several rooms, {{which is part}} of a large courtyard building, was discovered.

5|$|The {{remains of}} Ahmose's pyramid in Abydos were {{discovered}} in 1899 and identified as his in 1902.

However, two rows of intact casing stones were found by Arthur Mace, who estimated its steep slope as about 60 degrees, {{based on the evidence}} of the limestone casing (compare to the less acute 51 degrees of the Great Pyramid of Giza). Adjacent to the main pyramid temple and to its east, Harvey has identified two temples constructed by Ahmose's queen, Ahmose-Nefertary. One of these structures also bears bricks <b>stamped</b> with the name of Chief Treasurer Neferperet, the official responsible for re-opening the stone quarries at el-Ma'asara (Tura) in Ahmose's year 22. A third, larger temple (Temple C) is similar to the pyramid temple in form and scale, but its <b>stamped</b> bricks and details of decoration reinforce that it was a cult place for Ahmose-Nefertary.|$|E
