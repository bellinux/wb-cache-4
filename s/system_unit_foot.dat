40|$|Abstract. With Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) a {{new type}} of <b>system</b> <b>units</b> is {{introduced}} (aspects). One observed characteristic of AOP is that it results in a large number of additional (coarse-grained to ne-grained) <b>system</b> <b>units</b> (aspects) ready to be composed to the nal appli-cation. With this growing number of <b>system</b> <b>units</b> the dependencies be-tween them become vast and tangling. This results in the necessity of an improved management of the dependencies between these <b>system</b> <b>units.</b> Our paper investigates this problem, proposes a more general model (version model) to capture dierent facettes of AOP as well as a partial solution towards unit consistency based on versions. ...|$|R

40|$|A flight {{experiment}} to test {{and evaluate the}} skin friction drag characteristics of a riblet surface in turbulent flow at supersonic speeds was conducted at NASA Dryden. Riblets of groove sizes 0. 0030 and 0. 0013 in. were mounted on the F- 104 G flight test fixture. The test surfaces were surveyed with boundary layer rakes and pressure orifices to examine the boundary layer profiles and pressure distributions of the flow. Skin friction reductions caused by the riblet surface were reported based on measured differences of momentum thickness between the smooth and riblet surfaces obtained from the boundary layer data. Flight test results for the 0. 0030 in. riblet show skin friction reductions of 4 to 8 % for Mach numbers ranging from 1. 2 to 1. 6 and Reynolds numbers ranging from 2 to 3. 4 million per <b>unit</b> <b>foot.</b> The results from the 0. 0013 in. riblets show skin friction reductions of 4 to 15 % for Mach 1. 2 to 1. 4 and Reynolds numbers ranging from 3. 6 to 6 million per <b>unit</b> <b>foot...</b>|$|R

40|$|Various recent {{approaches}} aim {{at improving}} {{the application of}} the separation of concerns principle by introducing new <b>system</b> <b>units.</b> Although they seem to have the potential to improve the system development process, additional challenges evolve. This paper addresses some challenges concerning the reusability of these new <b>system</b> <b>units.</b> Our considerations about reusability are twofold. First, the independence of these <b>system</b> <b>units</b> is regarded on the mechanism level. Second, the composition validation problem emerging from the composition of these new and also reusable <b>system</b> <b>units</b> is investigated. The problems are illustrated by means of two examples. 1 Introduction and Problem Classification Common to recent approaches exploring the future beyond "objects" is that they all aim at a better separation of concerns. Besides objects, they introduce new units encapsulating concerns along additional dimensions. In this paper we comprise these units in the term "units of concerns". Though th [...] ...|$|R
