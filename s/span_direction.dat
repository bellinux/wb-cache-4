40|$|The {{distribution}} {{of stress in}} the cover sheets of thin-wall box beams is analyzed, {{with regard to the}} effect of shear deformation in the cover sheets, by the method of least work. Explicit results are obtained for a number of representative cases that show the influence of the following factors on the stress patterns. (1) Variation of stress in spanwise direction as given by elementary beam theory. (2) Value of a parameter called shear-lag aspect ratio which designates the product of span-width ratio of the beam and of the square root of the ratio of effective shear modulus and tensing modulus of the cover sheets. (3) Value of ratio of cover-sheet stiffness to side-web stiffness. (4) Variation of beam height in <b>span</b> <b>direction.</b> (5) Variation of beam width in <b>span</b> <b>direction.</b> (6) Variation of cover-sheet thickness in <b>span</b> <b>direction.</b> General conclusions are drawn from the results obtained.

In the analysis the aerodynamic forces are calculated off-line in case of a rigid wing, so the effect of aeroelastic coupling will be no taken in consideration.

Instead, the aerodynamic forces are provided by the U. S. Air Force Research Laboratory. First, the inhomogeneity of the wing in terms of mass distribution is studied for the rigid case and it is shown that a higher density at the wing root is beneficial in respect to the mechanical power required to achieve the forward flight. Then, the assumption of rigid wing is removed and the elastic deformation and its effects are investigated with the presence of structural geometric nonlinearities. The simulations showed that the inhomogeneity of the mass distribution played a role similar to the rigid case.

40|$|The {{condition}} of many important concrete structures can be partially assessed through the detection and monitoring of cracking. Usually, crack detection in bridges {{is based on}} visual inspection. This procedure is time consuming, expensive, and unreliable; therefore, the use of cracking sensors is highly recommended. Nevertheless, most existing sensors/ transducers are quite limited {{in their ability to}} detect and monitor cracks. This paper outlines the characteristics of fibre optic sensors for crack monitoring and a describes the improvements. The proposed technique does not require prior knowledge of crack locations, which is a significant benefit over existing crack monitoring techniques. Moreover, several cracks can be detected, located, and monitored with a single fibre. An ideal application of the sensor is in the monitoring of flexural cracks in bridges, which may appear at arbitrary locations along the deck, but are essentially perpendicular to the <b>spanning</b> <b>direction.</b> This report describes recent improvements introduced in the sensor to attain the necessary mechanical properties that enable the plate to crack together with the concrete, mainly by assuring that the plate has a brittle behaviour and breaks under a small strain. Consequently, the mechanical properties after the curing of polyester were evaluated considering different combinations of catalyst and accelerant. Bearing in mind the ductile behaviour of the polyester, different particles were added to change the sensitivity of the sensor. By changing the particle size distribution, the geometry (aspect ratio) and the density of the material added, it is possible to control the sensor’s sensitivity, e. g., to obtain a sensor that detects thinner or wider cracks. For measuring and improving the adhesion of the sensor plate to concrete, a study of polyesters and epoxies as adhesives was conducted and pull-off tests were performed...|$|R
