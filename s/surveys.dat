50|$|Initially, the Australian <b>Survey</b> Corps {{continued}} its mapping for the defence of Australia, proceeded with basic <b>survey</b> triangulation and provided training cadre for new field and training units. In January 1940, Field <b>Survey</b> Units RAE (Militia) {{were established in}} 1st Military District - Queensland, 2nd Military District - New South Wales and 3rd Military District - Victoria to accelerate the mapping effort. Deputy Assistant Directors - <b>Survey</b> were appointed to Military District Headquarters to advise on <b>survey</b> needs and to liaise with State agencies. In April 1940 the 2/1 Corps Field <b>Survey</b> Company RAE was raised {{as part of the}} 2nd Australian Imperial Force for service overseas and a <b>Survey</b> staff was appointed to the formation (Corps) headquarters. In September 1940 significant expansion of the Australian <b>Survey</b> Corps was approved by Cabinet to include a <b>Survey</b> Directorate on Army Headquarters (AHQ) and higher formation headquarters, an AHQ <b>Survey</b> Company, an AHQ Cartographic Company, regional command field <b>survey</b> companies, a <b>Survey</b> Section 7th Military District (Darwin) and a Corps <b>Survey</b> Mobile Reproduction Section. Four militia Field <b>Survey</b> Companies were established in the regional commands (1 Field <b>Survey</b> Coy - Queensland, 2 Field <b>Survey</b> Coy - New South Wales, 3 Field <b>Survey</b> Coy - Victoria, 4 Field <b>Survey</b> Coy - Western Australia) absorbing the Australian <b>Survey</b> Corps Sections and the Field <b>Survey</b> Units RAE (M) in the Commands.|$|R

5|$|The bristle-faced free-tailed bat {{appears to}} be {{extremely}} rare across its range.

Its preferred mode of foraging by flying at low levels along stream corridors suggests that the low numbers captured in <b>surveys</b> using mist nets and harp traps are an indication of rarity and are not an artifact of the survey methodology. Long-term monitoring of known populations is required to determine changes in population status of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat.|$|E

[...] Whereas the Down <b>Survey</b> was a cartographic <b>survey</b> based on measurements in the field, the Civil <b>Survey</b> was an inquisition which visited each barony and took depositions from landholders based on parish and townland, with written descriptions of their boundaries. The Civil <b>Survey</b> covered 27 of Ireland's 32 counties, excluding 5 counties in Connacht which had been covered in the 1630s by the Strafford <b>survey</b> commissioned by Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford.
