5000|$|C/C++ COM/DCOM {{programming}} interfaces: [...] Like most {{components in}} Windows, COM/DCOM programmers can leverage {{the features of}} the provider they develop at the COM/DCOM interfaces level. Like in previous environments (scripting and [...]NET Framework), a COM/DCOM consumer just needs to interact with the standard set of WMI COM interfaces to leverage the WMI provider capabilities and its set of supported WMI classes. To make all management information available from the native APIs, the WMI provider developer just needs to interact with a set of pre-defined WMI COM interfaces. This will make the management information available at the WMI COM level automatically. Moreover, the <b>scripting</b> <b>COM</b> interface object model is very similar to the COM/DCOM interface object model, which makes it easy for developers to be familiar with the scripting experience.|$|R

It contains preprocessor-like extensions for command definition, as well as custom classes for various system-related tasks like file I/O, operation system command invocation and redirection, and <b>COM</b> <b>scripting.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Yahoo Widget Engine (Konfabulator) {{has a very}} {{flexible}} application programming interface (API) based on JavaScript with many features useful to developers. A few basic features include items such as text-areas, images, and timers. Other features include the ability to download webpages from the Internet, as well as file input/output, and animator objects to aid in visual effects. A built in interface allows widget developers to run OS specific code such as shell <b>scripts</b> and <b>COM</b> applications on Windows, and AppleScript on Mac.|$|R
