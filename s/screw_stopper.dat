6000|$|I {{thought of}} nothing but the sphere until I reached it, I forgot even my trouble of Cavor's whereabouts. My last leap flung me with my hands hard against its glass; then I lay against it panting, and trying vainly to shout, [...] "Cavor! here is the sphere!" [...] When I had {{recovered}} a little I peered through the thick glass, and the things inside seemed tumbled. I stooped to peer closer. Then I attempted to get in. I had to hoist it over a little to get my head through the manhole. The <b>screw</b> <b>stopper</b> was inside, and I could see now that nothing had been touched, nothing had suffered. It lay there as we had left it when we had dropped out amidst the snow. For a time I was wholly occupied in making and remaking this inventory. I found I was trembling violently. It was good to see that familiar dark interior again! I cannot tell you how good. Presently I crept inside and sat down among the things. I looked through the glass at the moon world and shivered. I placed my gold clubs upon the table, and sought out and took a little food; {{not so much because}} I wanted it, but because it was there. Then {{it occurred to me that}} it was time to go out and signal for Cavor. But I did not go out and signal for Cavor forthwith. Something held me to the sphere.|$|E
50|$|MarkingsModern bottles, when moulded, will {{be given}} marks on the heel (bottom) of the bottle. These marks serve a variety of purposes, such as {{identifying}} the machine used {{in the production of}} the bottle (for quality control purposes), showing the manufacturer of the bottle, how much to fill the bottle to, the date the bottle was manufactured, as well as other information. Embossing on a bottle consists of raised lettering, numbers, and/or designs which were intended to inform the purchaser in some way of the contents or to establish ownership of the bottle.ClosuresGlass bottles have a variety of closures to seal up the bottle and prevent the contents escape. Early bottles were sealed with wax, and later stoppered with a cork. More common today are <b>screw</b> caps and <b>stoppers.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Allan {{picked up}} the flask of whisky lying on the deck near him, and revived his spirits with a dram. [...] "Here's one thing on board that isn't horrible," [...] he {{retorted}} briskly, as he <b>screwed</b> on the <b>stopper</b> of the flask; [...] "and here's another," [...] he added, as he took a cigar from his case and lit it. [...] "Three o'clock!" [...] he went on, looking at his watch, and settling himself comfortably on deck with {{his back against the}} bulwark. [...] "Daybreak isn't far off; we shall have the piping of the birds to cheer us up before long. I say, Midwinter, you seem to have quite got over that unlucky fainting fit. How you do keep walking! Come here and have a cigar, and make yourself comfortable. What's the good of tramping backward and forward in that restless way?" ...|$|R
60|$|Of course, it {{was quite}} clear to me what had {{happened}} to the boy. He had crawled into the sphere, meddled with the studs, shut the Cavorite windows, and gone up. It was highly improbable he had <b>screwed</b> the manhole <b>stopper,</b> and, even if he had, the chances were a thousand to one against his getting back. It was fairly evident that he would gravitate with my bales to somewhere near the middle of the sphere and remain there, and so cease to be a legitimate terrestrial interest, however remarkable he might seem to the inhabitants of some remote quarter of space. I very speedily convinced myself on that point. And as for any responsibility I might have in the matter, the more I reflected upon that, the clearer it became that if only I kept quiet about things, I need not trouble myself about that. If I was faced by sorrowing parents demanding their lost boy, I had merely to demand my lost sphere--or ask them what they meant. At first I had had a vision of weeping parents and guardians, and all sorts of complications; but now I saw that I simply had to keep my mouth shut, and nothing in that way could arise. And, indeed, the more I lay and smoked and thought, the more evident became the wisdom of impenetrability.|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} to explore a {{composite}} type piezoelectric motor. Its main structures include the piezoelectric stator, rotor, the preload adjusting module and shaft. Wherein the piezoelectric stator is made base, the composite type actuating element and stator formed. As the composite type actuating element is set by the axial vibration type actuating element, horizontal bending vibration type actuating element and vertical bending vibration type actuating element formed. The stator is an empty cylinder with a waist and tapered hole. In addition, the rotor {{is a kind of}} a hollow cone. It can be through the preload adjusting module to withstand the stator. As the preload adjusting module is set by the limit element, spring, washer and nut formed. While the shaft is a kind of cylinder with <b>screw</b> thread and <b>stopper,</b> it can pass through the piezoelectric stator, rotor and the preload adjusting module, making it a composite type piezoelectric motor. When we provide appropriate driving voltage, frequency, loading and phase angle to the piezoelectric stator, we can let the piezoelectric motor produces rapid rotation. Of course, we can also change through the driving phase angle, to change the direction of rotation of the piezoelectric motor. According to the experimental results, we found that its maximum speed and loading are 480 rpm and 2305 gw under conditions of 180 V p-p, 35 kHz and 0 0 driving phase angle. Most importantly, we also found that the composite type piezoelectric motor has a very good conversion efficiency of the driving phase angle. </p...|$|R
5000|$|Since the mid-1990s, {{a number}} of wine brands have {{switched}} to alternative wine closures such as plastic <b>stoppers,</b> <b>screw</b> caps, or other closures. During 1972 {{more than half of}} the Australian bottled wine went bad due to corking. A great deal of anger and suspicion was directed at Portuguese and Spanish cork suppliers who were suspected of deliberately supplying bad cork to non-EEC wine makers to help prevent cheap imports. Cheaper wine makers developed the aluminium [...] "Spelvin" [...] cap with a polypropylene stopper wad. More expensive wines and carbonated varieties continued to use cork, although much closer attention was paid to the quality. Even so, some high premium makers prefer the Spelvin as it is a guarantee that the wine will be good even after many decades of ageing. Some consumers may have conceptions about screw caps being representative of lower quality wines, due to their cheaper price; however, in Australia, for example, much of the non-sparkling wine production now uses these Spelvin caps as a cork alternative, although some have recently switched back to cork citing issues using screw caps. These alternatives to cork have both advantages and disadvantages. For example, screwtops are generally considered to offer a trichloroanisole (TCA) free seal, but they also reduce the oxygen transfer rate between the bottle and the atmosphere to almost zero, which can lead to a reduction in the quality of the wine. TCA is the main documented cause of cork taint in wine. However, some in the wine industry say natural cork stoppers are important because they allow oxygen to interact with wine for proper aging, and are best suited for wines purchased with the intent to age. Stoppers which resemble natural cork very closely can be made by isolating the suberin component of the cork from the undesirable lignin, mixing it with the same substance used for contact lenses and an adhesive, and molding it into a standardized product, free of TCA or other undesirable substances. [...] Composite corks with real cork veneers are used in cheaper wines.|$|R
