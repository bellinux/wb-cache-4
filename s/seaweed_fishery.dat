The {{definitive}} {{version of}} this publication is available at [URL] take of Postelsia palmaeformis (hereafter Postelsia), an annual kelp found only on wave-exposed, rocky shores of the Northeast Pacific, is increasing rapidly in California where regulation of the edible <b>seaweed</b> ???<b>fishery???</b> is minimal. Many commercial collectors use a frond trimming method they claim is sustainable and allows for multiple collections per year. Unlike cutting at the stipe, which is lethal and can drive populations to extinction, frond trimming preserves the meristem, allowing fronds to regrow. To evaluate the ecological consequences of biomass loss and sustainability of this commercial take method we conducted 2 field experiments. We trimmed fronds at different frequencies and times and then measured: (1) frond regrowth and reproductive output and (2) population recruitment. We explored the potential for geographic variation by replicating the first experiment near the center and southern limit of Postelsia???s biogeographic range. Fronds trimmed in April???June were able to regrow and eventually produce viable spores, albeit at somewhat reduced rates. However, spore production was sharply reduced when fronds were trimmed after the onset of sporogenesis (end of July), whether trimmed once or twice. These effects were similar across the geographic range examined but varied in magnitude. Recruitment was 38...|$|E
40|$|The {{coastal area}} of Bangladesh {{includes}} {{a number of}} bays into which different types of rivers empty, creating an estuarine ecosystem adjacent to the shore. The main estuarine systems are Brahmaputra-Megna (Gangetic delta), Karnaphuly, Matamuhuri, Bakkhali and Naf rivers, which are comprised of mangroves, salt marshes, seagrass, <b>seaweeds,</b> <b>fisheries,</b> coastal birds, animals, coral reefs, deltas, salt beds, minerals and sand dunes. The estuarine environment, which serves as feeding, breeding and nursery grounds {{for a variety of}} animals, varies according to the volume of discharge of the river and tidal range. It is highly productive in terms of nutrient input from different sources that promotes other living resources in the estuaries. Drought conditions exist during the winter months, i. e. November to February, and effective rainfall is confined to the monsoon period, i. e. May to June. Changes in salinity and turbidity depend on annual rainfall. The colour of most estuarine waters is tea brown or brown due to heavy outflows during the monsoon. The tidal mixing and riverine discharge governs the distribution of the hydrological parameters. The pH of these waters is reported to be slightly alkaline (> 7. 66) and dissolved oxygen (< 6. 0 mg/l) shows an inverse relationship to temperature. Studies of plankton have indicated two periods of maximum abundance, i. e. February-March and August-September. The abundance of fish and shrimp larvae varies in number and composition with season. Many marine and freshwater species are available in various types of coastal brackish water, which depend on monsoonal activities and local environmental conditions...|$|R
50|$|Seaweed {{farming is}} the {{practice}} of cultivating and harvesting seaweed. In its simplest form, it consists of the management of naturally found batches. In its most advanced form, it consists of fully controlling {{the life cycle of}} the algae. The main food species grown by aquaculture in Japan, China and Korea include Gelidium, Pterocladia, Porphyra, and Laminaria. Seaweed farming has frequently been developed as an alternative to improve economic conditions and to reduce fishing pressure and over exploited <b>fisheries.</b> <b>Seaweeds</b> have been harvested throughout the world as a food source as well as an export commodity for production of agar and carrageenan products.|$|R
40|$|Research PaperSeven {{economic}} instruments including property right regime, tradable permit, {{bond and}} deposit refund, liability, fiscal instrument, financial instrument, and charge system were considered for rehabilitations of coastal resources including mangrove, coastal water, coral, sea grass and <b>seaweed,</b> tourism, and <b>fishery</b> resources. Criteria on selective economic instruments were previous practice, management administration, technique including flexibility and efficacy, acceptability, and revenues. For mangrove, recommended instruments were fiscal and financial instruments providing the coordination among relevant agencies. For waste waters and garbage disposal in coastal areas, pollution charge was recommended while revenues should {{be transferred to}} strengthening management capability of locals. Liability system was recommended for coral through collaboration with local community in monitoring on resource abundance. Charge system on visiting quota could be applied in order to earn revenues for the operating cost. In case of sea grass and seaweed, liability system, conservation incentive, soft loan and subsidy could be applied. Charge system {{and the establishment of}} reasonable fee were recommended for Thai marine tourism. Tradable tourism quota should be in accordance with the environmental carrying capacity. Financial instrument could be applied and be paid for local environmental management cost. For small scale fisheries, community based fisheries management was recommended on the condition that suitable geographical location to accommodate exclusive right in local fisheries be identified. Priority should be given to fishing community with strong and capable community organization. Government could take part in co-management to strengthen community capacity and enforcement. Successful pilot project was the key of success. Individual transferable quota was recommended only for commercial fisheries provided improvement on landing and its regulation. Fishing fee should be adjusted to reflect true value of fishery resources...|$|R

In East Africa, they provide important ecosystem services (e. g. fisheries) but are potentially threatened by increasing resource use and lack of enforced management regulations. The major aim of this PhD thesis was to investigate effects of anthropogenic distur-bances, primarily seaweed farming and coastal fishery, in East African seagrass beds. Seaweed farming, often depicted as a sustainable form of aquaculture, had short- and long-term effects on seagrass growth and abundance that cascaded up through the food web {{to the level of}} fishery catches. The coastal fishery, a major subsistence activity in the region, can by removing urchin predators indirectly increase densities of the sea urchin Tripneustes gratilla, which has overgrazed seagrasses in several areas. A study using simulated grazing showed that high magnitude leaf removal – typical of grazing urchins – affected seagrasses more than low magnitude removal, typical of fish grazing. Different responses in two co-occurring seagrass species furthermore indicate that high seagrass diversity in tropical seagrass beds could buffer overgrazing effects in the long run. Finally, a literature synthesis suggests that anthropogenic disturbances could drive shifts in seagrass ecosystems to an array of alternative regimes dominated by other or-ganisms (macroalgae, bivalves, burrowing shrimp, polychaetes, etc.). The formation of novel feedback mechanisms makes these regimes resilient to disturbances like seagrass recovery and transplantation projects. Overall, this suggests that resource use activities linked to seagrasses can have large-scale implications if the scale exceeds critical levels. This emphasizes the need for holistic and adaptive management at the seascape level, specifically involving improved techniques for <b>seaweed</b> farming and <b>fisheries,</b> protection of keystone species, and ecosystem-based management approaches...|$|R
