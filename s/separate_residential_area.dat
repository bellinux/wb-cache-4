50|$|Opaheke became {{recognised}} as {{an independent}} suburb in 1989. The previous area {{was referred to as}} a small area of greater Papakura, but has now developed into a <b>separate</b> <b>residential</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1945, a <b>separate</b> <b>residential</b> <b>area</b> {{was created}} on the {{northern}} side for Haenke's son Willis and his wife Helen who inherited the property when Will died in 1953. Willis continued the family interest in coalmining and Helen was a writer who published several books of poetry and wrote several plays which were performed in Brisbane and Ipswich. Today, Rockton is owned by their daughter Angela and her husband Wybe Geertsma.|$|E

Prominent buildings include Ensley's Store, Bogarts, and the Sylva KFC.|$|R
50|$|Many organizations, businesses, {{and homeowners}} {{associations}} had official policies to exclude Mexican Americans. In many areas across the Southwest, Mexican Americans lived in <b>separate</b> <b>residential</b> <b>areas,</b> due to laws {{and real estate}} company policies. This group of laws and policies, known as redlining, lasted until the 1950s, and fall under the concept of official segregation.|$|R
25|$|The {{creation}} of the apartheid system in South Africa, which began in 1948 but reached its full flowering in the 1960s and 1970s, involved some ethnic cleansing, including the separation of blacks, Coloureds, and whites into <b>separate</b> <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> and private spheres. The government created Bantustans, which involved forced removals of non-white populations to reserved lands.|$|R
50|$|Many public institutions, businesses, {{and homeowners}} {{associations}} had official policies to exclude Mexican Americans. School children of Mexican American descent {{were subject to}} racial segregation {{in the public school}} system. In many counties, Mexican Americans were excluded from serving as jurors in court cases, especially in those that involved a Mexican American defendant. In many areas across the Southwest, they lived in <b>separate</b> <b>residential</b> <b>areas,</b> due to laws and real estate company policies.|$|R

25|$|The Hattians {{came into}} contact with Assyrians traders from Assur in Mesopotamia such as at Kanesh (Nesha) near modern Kültepe who {{provided}} them with the tin needed to make bronze. These trading posts or Karums (Akkadian for Port), have lent their name to a period, the Karum Period. The Karums, or Assyrian trading colonies, persisted in Anatolia until Hammurabi conquered Assyria and it fell under Babylonian domination in 1756 BC. These Karums represented <b>separate</b> <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> where the traders lived, protected by the Hattites, and paying taxes in return. Meanwhile, the fortifications of Hattush were strengthened with construction of royal residences on Büyükkale.|$|R

5000|$|Pilsley is a rural {{village and}} civil parish in Northeast Derbyshire, near Chesterfield. At the 2011 census the {{population}} was 3,487. [...] Pilsley consists of two distinct <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> known as Lower Pilsley and Pilsley (sometimes Upper Pilsley). Lower Pilsley being the northern <b>residential</b> <b>area</b> and Pilsley being the southern <b>residential</b> <b>area.</b> There is some local disagreement as to whether these two areas constitute two separate villages or one larger village. At {{the start of the}} village's life, people referred to the area around what is now Pilsley primary as Nether Pilsley. Both areas of the village are united by the same parish council, Pilsley Parish Council, which was formed on 30 January 1874; Pilsley having previously been part of the parish of North Wingfield. Maps show that the village is made up of four <b>separate</b> <b>residential</b> <b>areas,</b> which are, in order of their north to south alignment, Lower Pilsley, Upper Pilsley, Pilsley and Nether Pilsley.|$|R

5000|$|Violence and {{discrimination}} against Mexican Americans (usually of lower class and visible Amerindian ancestry) {{continued into the}} 1950s and 1960s. Many organizations, businesses, and homeowners associations had official policies to exclude Mexican Americans. In many areas across the Southwest, Mexican Americans lived in <b>separate</b> <b>residential</b> <b>areas,</b> due to laws and real estate company policies.This group of laws and policies, known as redlining, lasted until the 1950s, and fall under the concept of official segregation. In many other instances, {{it was more of}} a general social understanding that Mexicans should be excluded from White society. For instance, signs with the phrase [...] "No Dogs or Mexicans" [...] were posted in small businesses and public pools throughout the Southwest well into the 60's.|$|R
50|$|Wyrrabalong National Park borders {{the lake}} and the sea <b>separating</b> the <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> of Toukley and The Entrance, and {{preserves}} the last significant littoral rainforest on the Central Coast.

50|$|Encompassing some 660 ha of {{land and}} 20 ha of water, the Gömmaren area is a large forest <b>separating</b> the <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> Vårby, Skärholmen, Segeltorp, Snättringe, Fullersta, and Glömsta. Dozens of schools {{bordering}} the area are using it in their education, and {{the large number of}} paths criss-crossing it tittle-tattles its long popularity. Lake Gömmaren is very popular for bathing and angling.|$|R
50|$|The lake is <b>separated</b> {{from the}} <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> {{in the north}} by a highway which {{prevents}} it from potential pollution. The {{southern part of the}} lake has been polluted from waters of onshore oil production activities in the past.|$|R
50|$|Although a few {{internal}} walls {{have been removed}} and some added, and rooms have been built into the verandah, the general form of the house has altered little.

5|$|Fifteen {{buildings}} {{are open to}} the public as part of the Rancho Camulos Museum, all of which were built before 1930 and are still in their original locations. They were built mostly in Spanish Colonial or Mission Revival styles (the latter is derived from the former). Later buildings were designed in differing architectural styles, more representative of their period of construction. Landscaping features, such as lawns, flower gardens, ornamental trees, and walkways, <b>separate</b> the <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> from the working portions of the ranch.|$|R
5000|$|Nazi policy {{stressed}} {{the superiority of}} the Nordic race, a sub-race of the white European population defined by the measurement of the size and proportions of the human body models of racial difference. From 1940 the Nazis in General Government (occupied Poland) divided the population into different groups. Each group had different rights, food rations, allowed strips in the cities, <b>separated</b> <b>residential</b> <b>areas,</b> special schooling systems, public transportation and restricted restaurants. Later adapted in all Nazi-occupied countries by 1942, the Germanization program used the racial caste system of reserving certain rights to one group and barred privileges to another. Ethnic Poles were believed by Hitler to be [...] "biologically inferior race" [...] that could never be educated or elevated through Germanization. In 1940, Hitler approved of a plan regarding the Germanization of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, he estimated around half of the Czech population were suitable for Germanization but made clear that the [...] "mongoloid" [...] types and Czech intelligentsia were not allowed to be Germanized.|$|R
25|$|Cemeteries take {{up another}} {{large part of}} this small neighborhood, {{although}} they are <b>separated</b> from <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> for the most part. The Mount Olivet Cemetery, the largest cemetery in the neighborhood, is located on a high hill in Maspeth and {{used to be an}} outer-borough vacation site. Mount Olivet Cemetery was planned on March 26, 1850, when James Maurice held a meeting at his Maspeth house to discuss the formation of the cemetery. Notable interments in the cemetery include cosmetics magnate Helena Rubinstein Courielli and sixteen victims of the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire.|$|R
50|$|Elk Grove Village, {{incorporated}} in 1956 in Elk Grove Township, was founded as a planned suburban community. The majority of houses were constructed by Centex Corporation. As {{part of the}} original planning concept, the village was to be home to <b>separated</b> <b>residential</b> and industrial <b>areas</b> (the latter of which would later become the largest contiguous industrial park in North America).|$|R
5000|$|As Korea's first planned city, {{modeled after}} Canberra, Australia, Changwon uses {{accessible}} urban planning including {{a large number}} of parks and <b>separate</b> <b>residential</b> and industrial <b>areas.</b> The city has also branded itself an [...] "environmental capital" [...] with the municipal government actively participating in climate change conferences and committing to the development of sustainable policies like the globally recognized bike-sharing program, Nubija.|$|R
5000|$|The suburb {{is mainly}} {{residential}} {{on the eastern}} side of the suburb. The area between the Eyre Highway and the Stuart Highway on the west side of the suburb’s built area is zoned for industrial use.

40|$|An {{accurate}} {{diagnosis of}} heterozygotes for autosomal recessive disorders with unknown mutations can be difficult. Using a unique phenomenon occurring in vivo, we designed {{a method for}} the diagnosis of heterozygotes for adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) deficiency which makes way for a qualitative distinction between normal and heterozygous subjects. We cultured {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} with 2, 6 -diaminopurine, an APRT-dependent cytotoxin, to search for in vivo mutational cells. Fifteen putative heterozygotes examined were found to possess such mutant cells at rather high frequencies; thus, a false negative diagnosis is unlikely. The analysis of genomic DNA in 82 resistant clones from two of the heterozygotes clarified that 64 (78 %) had lost the germinally intact alleles. Thirteen members of APRT-deficient families were examined; eight proved to be heterozygotes. Among 425 individuals from two <b>separate</b> <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> of Japan, two heterozygotes were found. The authenticity of the heterozygosity was validated by two separate methods for the two heterozygotes; hence, a false positive diagnosis can be ruled out. Our data showed a calculated heterozygote frequency of 0. 47 % (95 % confidence limits; 0. 05 %- 1. 7 %), a value compatible with that (1. 2 %) calculated from data concerning the incidence of 2, 8 -dihydroxyadenine urolithiasis. This novel genetic approach for identifying heterozygotes is now being tested to search for other enzyme deficiencies in humans...|$|R

5000|$|The Gare do Oriente, or eastern train station, was {{constructed}} for the 1998 Lisbon World Exposition, and {{is located in}} a former iindustrial area. It was designed to bridge the wasteland which <b>separated</b> the <b>residential</b> <b>area</b> of the city from the Tagus River. Similar to the galleria he designed in Toronto, but on a grander scale, the interior of the station features a forest of while columns like gigantic trees that support the glass roof, 238 meters by 78 meters, which covers the eight tracks. The station complex also includes a shopping center, and transport links by tram and metro {{to the center of the}} city. With its multiple arches and curves, the structure appears to be moving and ready to take off.|$|R
5000|$|A {{separate}} {{city from}} the late 1970s until the 1990s, Soweto {{is now part of}} Johannesburg. Originally an acronym for [...] "South-Western Townships", Soweto originated as a collection of settlements on the outskirts of Johannesburg, populated mostly by native African workers from the gold mining industry. Soweto, although eventually incorporated into Johannesburg, had been <b>separated</b> as a <b>residential</b> <b>area</b> for blacks, who were not permitted to live in Johannesburg proper. Lenasia is predominantly populated by English-speaking South Africans of Indian descent.|$|R
40|$|In recent decades, Seoul in Korea has {{experienced}} a rapid economic and urban development. As a result, the city exposes extreme disharmony between different zones. For example, the heavy mega structures are inconsiderately located {{right next to the}} small old fabric district. The thesis especially focuses on the urban conflict between high-rise and low-rise <b>residential</b> <b>areas.</b> The later high-rising development impaired single family housing environment and drastically changed existing urban landscape and structure. Instead of pursuing coexistence and sharing, it chose to delete all the historical accumulation over time and to be inserted like an urban island in the city. The goal of this thesis is to reconcile these two - physically adjacent but, - in reality, totally <b>separated</b> <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> {{in such a way that}} redesign the boundary while respecting the existing systems of two zones. This mediating zone will provide two areas with what those lack. Whereas infrastructure such as parking and circulation system will tie the old fabric up as a whole, bringing urbanity into mega block will enrich tower residents' urban life. The project will provide communal, commercial, and public - indoor and outdoor - programs serving for both zones. As an architectural device, the stair contributes to 3 -dimensional organization of a current 2 -dimensionally treated division. This thesis focuses three main attributes of stairs; First, the verticality of stairs connects two levels creating a sequence of experiences from the lower level to the higher level. Second, inhabitability of stairs implies that stairs can be used not only for circulation purpose but also occupiable space. Third, its strong figurativeness strengthens the degree of singularity as an urban artifact. by Yoonhee Cho. Thesis (M. Arch.)

2500|$|The central {{region of}} Dunedin {{is known as}} the Octagon. It was once a gully, filled in the mid nineteenth century to create the present plaza. The initial {{settlement}} of the city took place to the south {{on the other side of}} Bell Hill, a large outcrop which had to be reduced to provide easy access between the two parts of the settlement. The central city stretches away from this point in a largely northeast-southwest direction, with the main streets of George Street and Princes Street meeting at The Octagon. Here they are joined by Stuart Street, which runs orthogonally to them, from the Dunedin Railway Station in the southeast, and steeply up to the suburb of Roslyn in the northwest. Many of the city's notable old buildings are located in the southern part of this area and on the inner ring of lower hills which surround the central city (most of these hills, such as Maori Hill, Pine Hill, and Maryhill, rise to some [...] above the plain). The head of the harbour includes a large area of reclaimed land ("The Southern Endowment"), much of which is used for light industry and warehousing. A large area of flat land, simply known colloquially as [...] "The Flat" [...] lies to the south and southwest of the city centre, and includes several larger and older suburbs, notably South Dunedin and St. Kilda. These are protected from the Pacific Ocean by a long line of dunes which run east-west along the city's southern coastline and <b>separate</b> <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> from Ocean Beach, which is traditionally divided into St. Clair Beach at the western end and St. Kilda Beach to the east.|$|R
25|$|There were {{social changes}} {{as well as}} {{economic}} ones in Málaga during the reign of Isabel II—the bourgeoisie solidified its position as an oligarchy in control of local politics, while a labouring class of industrial workers developed in the factories. The presence of these large factories resulted in the growth of an industrial and workers' suburb {{on the banks of the}} Guadalmedina river, <b>separate</b> from the <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> of the bourgeoisie in the centre and the eastern part of the city. The city's population continued to grow, creating a need for the expansion of civil infrastructure.|$|R
