This paper investigates the causality issues between <b>seaport</b> infrastructure investment and economic growth in Korea by applying modern time-series techniques. It employs annual data covering the period 1970 â€“ 2002. Tests for unit roots, cointegration, and Granger-causality based on error correction models are presented. The results show that unidirectional causality runs from <b>seaport</b> infrastructure investment to economic growth without any feedback effect. This means that increase in <b>seaport</b> infrastructure investment directly affects economic growth. In order not to adversely affect economic growth, the Korean government and industry should endeavour to overcome the constraints on <b>seaport</b> infrastructure investment. <b>seaport</b> infrastructure; infrastructure investment; economic growth; causality; Korea; critical infrastructures...|$|R
