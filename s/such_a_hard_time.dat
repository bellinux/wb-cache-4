25|$|Home Life of Great Authors, {{published}} in Chicago, in 1877, included descriptive sketches of many authors, with glimpses {{of their home}} life and personal and domestic character: Goethe, Wordsworth, Lamb, Shelley, Emerson, George Sand, Tennyson, Whittier, Robert and Elizabeth B. Browning, Poe, Eliot, Burns, De Quincey, North, Irving, Carlyle, Macaulay, Hawthorne, Holmes, Charlotte Bronte, Thackeray, Kingsley, Madame de Stael, Scott, Lord Byron, Bryant, Hugo, Lytton, Longfellow, Lowell, Margaret Fuller, Dickens, and Ruskin. As its title would indicate, the book aimed to give a more personal and intimate view {{of men and women}} well-known to fame than was to be found in most reference works. The young readers of this volume learned that dates and statistics do not enable them to know people; they need to have some personal details as to the habits and daily lives of the people about whom they read. Griswold said in one of her works that as she had had <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> {{when she was a girl}} getting any picture in her mind of the great people about whom she read, that she determined to make it easier for other boys and girls to obtain these mental pictures; that is why she wrote The Home Life of Great Authors.|$|E

[...] An early mix of the track was included on some versions of the 20th anniversary reissue of Achtung Baby.

500|$|According to scholar Sondra O'Neale, Angelou's poetry can {{be placed}} within the African-American oral tradition, and her prose [...] "follows classic {{technique}} in nonpoetic Western forms". [...] O'Neale states that Angelou avoided using a [...] "monolithic black language", and accomplished, through direct dialogue, what O'Neale calls a [...] "more expected ghetto expressiveness". [...] McWhorter finds both the language Angelou used in her autobiographies and the people she depicted unrealistic, resulting in a separation {{between her and her}} audience. [...] As McWhorter states, [...] "I have never read autobiographical writing where I had <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> summoning a sense of how the subject talks, or a sense of who the subject really is". [...] McWhorter asserts, for example, that key figures in Angelou's books, like herself, her son Guy, and mother Vivian do not speak as one would expect, and that their speech is [...] "cleaned up" [...] for her readers. [...] Guy, for example, represents the young black male, while Vivian represents the idealized mother figure, and the stiff language they use, as well as the language in Angelou's text, is intended to prove that blacks can use standard English competently.|$|E

40|$|International audienceRecent color {{transfer}} methods use local {{information to}} learn the transformation from a source to an exemplar image, and then transfer this appearance change to a target image. These solutions achieve very successful results for general mood changes, e. g., changing the appearance of an image from ``sunny'' to ``overcast''. However, <b>such</b> methods have <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> creating new image content, such as leaves on a bare tree. Texture transfer, on the other hand, can synthesize such content but tends to destroy image structure. We propose the first algorithm that unifies color and texture transfer, outperforming both by leveraging their respective strengths. A key novelty in our approach resides in teasing apart appearance changes that can be modeled simply as changes in color versus those that require new image content to be generated. Our method starts with an analysis phase which evaluates the success of color transfer by comparing the exemplar with the source. This analysis then drives a selective, iterative texture transfer algorithm that simultaneously predicts the success of color transfer on the target and synthesizes new content where needed. We demonstrate our unified algorithm by transferring large temporal changes between photographs, such as change of season [...] e. g., leaves on bare trees or piles of snow on a street [...] and flooding...|$|R

2500|$|In May 1986, during Piper's five-month hiatus {{from the}} WWF, Adonis (with Hart) debuted his own talk segment, The Flower Shop. These {{segments}} {{were the primary}} backdrop for Paul Orndorff's slow-building heel turn against his friend Hulk Hogan, with Adonis relentlessly needling Orndorff about living in Hogan's shadow. In August, shortly before Piper's return, Adonis obtained the services of Piper's bodyguard, [...] "Cowboy" [...] Bob Orton, who took to wearing a pink cowboy hat. A feud with Piper heated up when Adonis, Orton, and Don Muraco attacked him during a [...] "duel" [...] between the two talk segments, injuring his leg, covering him in lipstick and damaging the Pit set. A week later, Piper destroyed the set of The Flower Shop with a baseball bat. It was never rebuilt. On the October 4 edition of Saturday Night's Main Event, Piper struck Adonis with a crutch, resulting in a two-month absence from TV with an alleged separated shoulder. After Adonis returned in November to attack Piper on the Pit, the two agreed to a hair vs. hair match at WrestleMania III. Piper won the bout with help from Brutus Beefcake, who cut off the majority of Adonis' hair afterward. Piper was initially supposed {{to cut off the}} hair himself, but had <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> because the hair was too wet, and when he got Beefcake to help out, that was the start of Beefcake's gimmick as [...] "The Barber". Adonis then began a feud with Beefcake but was fired in May 1987 for what the WWF claimed were [...] "dress code violations".|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of the studies on performance measurement systems (PMSs) for {{small- and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) shows an important contradiction: on the one hand, we often find evidence that <b>such</b> enterprises have <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> rationalising their operational practices and strategic processes, and consider strategy as mainly emerging; on the other hand, scholarly literature offers methodologies for the implementation of a PMS that are based upon a top-down approach and that aim at translating strategy into action, with little consideration to the tendency of small enterprises not to give much importance to the formalisation of their strategic choices. To contribute to this research gap, the authors identify a circular methodology to implement a strategically aligned PMS in SMEs. The proposed methodology is based on the balanced scorecard model and features four main phases: (1) the {{analysis of}} current ‘individual dashboards’ to actually show the performances that are kept under control; (2) the clarification of the key success factors (critical success factors (CSFs)) underlying the measures under control; (3) the definition of the desired strategy map {{as a result of the}} comparison between CSFs that are currently under control and the desired strategy; (4) the translation of the desired strategy map into a dashboard of indicators necessary for the implementation of the strategy. The identified implementation process features key aspects, connecting the actual strategy with the intentional strategy and engaging SMEs in a process of observation and clarification of their future vision...|$|R
40|$|Sophisticated {{algorithms}} for control, {{state estimation}} and equalization have tremendous potential {{to improve performance}} and create new capabilities in embedded and mobile systems. Traditional implementation approaches are not well suited for porting these algorithmic solutions into practical implementations within embedded system constraints. Most of the technical challenges arise from design approach that manipulates only one level in the design stack, thus being forced to conform to constraints imposed by other levels without question. In tightly constrained environments, like embedded and mobile systems, <b>such</b> approaches have <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> efficiently delivering and delivering efficiency. In this work we offer a solution that cuts through all the design stack layers. We build flexible structures at the hardware, software and algorithm level, and approach the solution through design space exploration. To do this efficiently we use a template-based hardware-software development flow. The main incentive for template use is, as in software development, to relax the generality vs. efficiency/performance type tradeoffs that appear in solutions striving to achieve run-time flexibility. As a form of static polymorphism, templates typically incur very little performance overhead once the design is instantiated, thus offering the possibility to defer many design decisions until later stages when more {{is known about the}} overall system design. However, simply including templates into design flow is not sufficient to result in benefits greater than some level of code reuse. In our work we propose using templates as flexible interfaces between various levels in the design stack. <b>As</b> <b>such,</b> template parameters become the common language that designers at different levels of design hierarchy can use to succinctly express their assumptions and ideas. Thus, it is of great benefit if template parameters map directly and intuitively into models at every level. To showcase the approach we implement a numerical accelerator for embedded Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm. While most of this work and design flow are quite general, their full power is realized in search for good solutions to a specific problem. This is best understood in direct comparison with recent works on embedded and high-speed MPC implementations. The controllers we generate outperform published works by a handsome margin in both speed and power consumption, while taking very little time to generate. by Ranko Radovin Sredojević. Thesis (Ph.
