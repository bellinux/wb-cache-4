60|$|The {{buildings}} of the Chase Farm lay at one extremity of the Chase, at about ten minutes' walking distance from the Abbey. Adam had come thither on his pony, intending to ride to the stables and put up his nag on his way home. At the stables he encountered Mr. Craig, {{who had come to}} look at the captain's new horse, on which he was to ride away the day after to-morrow; and Mr. Craig detained him to tell how all the servants were to collect at the gate of the courtyard to wish the young squire luck as he rode out; so that by the time Adam had got into the Chase, and was striding along with the basket of tools over his shoulder, the sun was on the point of setting, and was <b>sending</b> <b>level</b> crimson rays among the great trunks of the old oaks, and touching every bare patch of ground with a transient glory that made it look like a jewel dropt upon the grass. The wind had fallen now, and there was only enough breeze to stir the delicate-stemmed leaves. Any one who had been sitting in the house all day would have been glad to walk now; but Adam had been quite enough in the open air to wish to shorten his way home, and he bethought himself that he might do so by striking across the Chase and going through the Grove, where he had never been for years. He hurried on across the Chase, stalking along the narrow paths between the fern, with Gyp at his heels, not lingering to watch the magnificent changes of the light--hardly once thinking of it--yet feeling its presence in a certain calm happy awe which mingled itself with his busy working-day thoughts. How could he help feeling it? The very deer felt it, and were more timid.|$|E

Kindley's main goal {{was to make the}} game for free, but have {{people all over the world}} <b>send</b> <b>levels</b> to add to it. Kindley is not {{currently}} involved with LaserTank, but has stated [...] "Maybe someday I will re-enter the world of LaserTank". Donald Drouin of Canada is now the official LaserTank manager who gathers new levels and regularly updates the official LaserTank website, as well as providing interesting statistics to other players regarding current records and high scores.|$|R

40|$|Interface {{designers}} are increasingly exploring alternative approaches to user input/control. LAMI is a Leap (Motion-based) AMI which takes user’s hand gestures and maps these to a three-dimensional stage {{displayed on a}} computer monitor. Audio channels are visualised as spheres whose Y coordinate is spectral centroid and X and Z coordinates are controlled by hand position and represent pan and <b>level</b> respectively. Auxiliary <b>send</b> <b>levels</b> are controlled via wrist rotation and vertical hand position and visually represented as dial-like arcs. Channel EQ curve is controlled by manipulating a lathed column visualisation. Design of LAMI followed an iterative design cycle with candidate interfaces rapidly prototyped, evaluated and refined. LAMI was evaluated against Logic Pro X in a defined audio mixing task...|$|R
50|$|Most digital mixers use {{technology}} to reduce physical space requirements, entailing compromises in user interface {{such as a}} single shared channel adjustment area that is selectable for only one channel at a time. Additionally, most digital mixers have virtual pages or layers that change fader banks into separate controls for additional inputs or for adjusting equalization or aux <b>send</b> <b>levels.</b> This layering can be confusing for some operators. Analog consoles make for simpler understanding of hardware routing. Many digital mixers allow internal reassignment of inputs so that convenient groupings of inputs appear near {{each other at the}} fader bank, a feature that can be disorienting for persons having to make a hardware patch change.|$|R
5000|$|A superset of the General MIDI {{standard}} which added several proprietary extensions. The {{most notable}} addition was {{the ability to}} address multiple banks of programs (instrument sounds) by using an additional pair of Bank Select controllers to specify up to 16384 [...] "variation" [...] sounds (cc#0 is Bank Select MSB, and cc#32 is Bank Select LSB). Other most notable features were 9 Drum kits with 14 additional drum sounds each, simultaneous Percussion Kits - up to 2 (Channels 10/11), Control Change messages for controlling the <b>send</b> <b>level</b> of sound effect blocks (cc#91-94), entering additional parameters (cc#98-101), portamento, sostenuto, soft pedal (cc#65-67), and model-specific SysEx messages for setting various parameters of the synth engine.|$|R
50|$|Some higher-end {{consoles}} use {{voltage-controlled amplifier}} (VCA) groups VCAs and DCAs function somewhat like subgroups but let the operator control {{the level of}} multiple input channels with a single fader. Unlike subgroups, no sub-mix is created. The audio signals from the assigned channels remain routed independently of VCA assignments. Since no sub-mix is created, {{it is not possible}} to insert processing such as compressors into a VCA/DCA group. In addition, on most VCA/DCA-equipped consoles, post-fader auxiliary <b>send</b> <b>levels</b> are affected by the VCA master. This is usually desirable, as post-fader auxiliary sends are commonly used for effects such as reverb, and sends to these effects should track changes in the channel signal level.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} rain gauge system using a coaxial {{capacitance}} sensor. The proposed system {{consists of a}} high-pass filter, a coaxial capacitance sensor, SMS module, a microcontroller and a smartphone. The sensor capacitance {{is proportional to the}} rainfall levels. It is converted into voltage signal. The corresponding voltage signal is sent to the microcontroller for converting the signal levels to the rainfall levels in millimetres. The microcontroller <b>sends</b> the rainfall <b>levels</b> to the SMS module that then <b>sends</b> the rainfall <b>level</b> data to show on the display screen of the smartphone. The experimental results showed that the proposed prototype can provide the correct data compared to the traditional system...|$|R
50|$|This {{version is}} very similar in {{cosmetics}} with the previous one but it introduces, for the first time, a full tube tremolo in a modern twin amp. The front panel contains (left to right): a single input, clean channel controls (volume, bright switch, treble, middle, bass), distorted channel controls (volume, treble, middle, bass, master volume, channel select), and shared controls (reverb, tremolo speed and intensity, presence). The rear panel contains power and stand by switches, output power switch (100W or 25W), effect <b>send</b> <b>level,</b> effect loop switch, return level, preamp out, power amp in, footswitch jack, tube bias adjustment and balancing, external speaker jack, main speaker jack. The footswitch has four buttons that allow to select the channel, bypass or engage the effect loop, switch the tremolo on/off, switch the reverb on/off. The tremolo is a tube bias tremolo. Curiously, it can be switched on through the footswitch only. The amplifier features two 12 inch Eminence special design loudspeakers in parallel (8ohms each, 4 ohms total load). There is no output impedance switch and the total impedance of the main plus external speaker has to be 4 ohms.|$|R

50|$|To {{convert a}} signal from {{balanced}} to unbalanced requires a balun. For example, baluns {{can be used to}} <b>send</b> line <b>level</b> audio or E-carrier level 1 signals over coaxial cable (which is unbalanced) through 300 ft of category 5 cable by using a pair of baluns {{at each end of the}} CAT5 run. The balun takes the unbalanced signal, and creates an inverted copy of that signal. It then sends these 2 signals across the CAT5 cable as a balanced, differential signal. Upon reception at the other end, the balun takes the difference of the two signals, thus removing any noise picked up along the way and recreating the unbalanced signal.|$|R

Using vision as a sensor enables the helicopter to track features in an urban environment. We use vision for feature detection and a combination of vision and GPS for navigation and tracking. The vision algorithm <b>sends</b> high <b>level</b> velocity commands to the helicopter controller which is then able to command the helicopter to track them.

50|$|Superintendent Wai (Michael Miu) organises an operation, code named WO HU, {{where he}} sends {{an army of}} {{undercover}} cops to spy on triad leader Jim (Eric Tsang). Jim discovers one of the undercover cops, Eric (Timmy Hung), and <b>sends</b> low <b>level</b> triad member, Killer (Shawn Yue), to assassinate him. Killer carries the hit but failed to flee Hong Kong afterwards. Then, Jim orders other triad leaders, Walter (Francis Ng) and Tommy (Julian Cheung), to keep it low {{in order to avoid}} the cops' attention. Tommy believes that his triad brothers are plotting to take his assets. After Tommy was exposed by an undercover cop in his crew, he must flee Hong Kong and leave his businesses to Jim. Tommy, however, does not trust Jim and plots against him.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Various MAC {{protocols}} {{have been}} suggested for exploiting the possible benefits provided by directional antennas, {{but most of the}} solutions suggested are either based on the concept of <b>sending</b> (MAC <b>level)</b> control packets (such as RTS and CTS) in all directions, or based on the use of some omni-directional control packet transmissions. We believe that these approaches fail short of exploiting the capability of directional transmission/reception fully and are incapable of handling all the problems resulting from the use of directional antennas in multi-hop wireless networks. Hence we first propose a set of requirements that should be met by a good MAC protocol that uses directional antennas. Then we propose a Directional Busy Signal Multiple Access (DBSMA) protocol that meets these requirements. In DBSMA, all the transmissions, receptions, and idle listening are directional. The need to listen in many direction...|$|R

40|$|We {{elaborate}} on the suggestion made in arXiv: 0806. 3498 that the 3 d = 8 superconformal SU(N) Chern-Simons-matter theory of Lorentzian Bagger-Lambert-Gustavson type (L-BLG) {{can be obtained by}} a scaling limit (involving <b>sending</b> the <b>level</b> k to infinity and redefining the fields) from the = 6 superconformal U(N) xU(N) Chern-Simons-matter theory of Aharony, Bergman, Jafferis and Maldacena (ABJM). We show that to implement such a limit in a consistent way one is to extend the ABJM theory by an abelian "ghost" multiplet. The corresponding limit at the 3 -algebra level also requires extending the non-antisymmetric Bagger-Lambert 3 -algebra underlying the ABJM theory by a negative-norm generator. We draw analogy with similar scaling limits discussed previously for bosonic Chern-Simons theory and comment on some implications of this relation between the ABJM and L-BLG theories.

5000|$|The player {{must be able}} to {{complete}} their own level with all coins in normal mode {{in order to ensure that}} it is actually possible to beat. A level can be verified in separate attempts such as completing a run through in one attempt and then collecting coins in another; however any changes made to the level will make it unverified. These levels can either have the same music already in the game or custom music from Newgrounds. Each user-created level has a unique ID, which can be used to play the level without searching its name. As similar to the official levels, user-created levels are classified by difficulty, which is decided by RobTop, by players or [...] "level mods" [...] who can <b>send</b> a <b>level</b> to RobTop to be rated.

25|$|One of {{the final}} steps for a {{periphery}} country to rise to semi-periphery or core status is to educate its citizens. Raising the literacy rate allows ideas to spread more quickly through a country and also allows people to better communicate with themselves {{and the rest of}} the world. Also once universities are developed a country can begin to research new technology. Researching new technology can help a country to better compete in a global market by becoming more efficient or selling new technology and industrial techniques. If education and industry is allowed to become developed enough it is entirely possible for a periphery country to rise to core country status and become a leader in the global market.
