40|$|The H 5 N 1 {{influenza}} {{outbreak in}} Hong Kong {{at the end}} of 1997 emphasised the need for viral surveillance so that new influenza epidemics can be foreseen. Although South China is regarded as the regional epicentre of influenza epidemics, there has been little epidemiological documentation of the disease there. A <b>sentinel</b> <b>physician</b> network was established in Hong Kong in 1993 to estimate the incidence, severity, and seasonality of influenza-like illnesses and to provide data on the demand for health care that is related to this illness. Influenza-like illness occurred throughout the year of the survey, peaking from March through May and accounting for 15 % of doctor visits. The incidence was approximately 117 in 1000 patients and was greatest among children aged 1 to 4 years. Ongoing physician surveillance with appropriate coverage of the general population supported by a laboratory virus isolation capability may help control future influenza outbreaks. published_or_final_versio...|$|E
40|$|This review assesses {{differences}} and similarities {{of the states}} in planning for pandemic influenza. We reviewed the recently posted plans of 49 states for vaccination, early epidemic surveillance and detection, and intraepidemic plans for containment of pandemic influenza. All states generally follow vaccination priorities set by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. They all also depend on National <b>Sentinel</b> <b>Physician</b> Surveillance and other passive surveillance systems to alert them to incipient epidemic influenza, but these systems may not detect local epidemics until they are well established. Because {{of a lack of}} epidemiologic data, few states explicitly discuss implementing nonpharmaceutical community interventions: voluntary self-isolation (17 states [35 %]), school or other institutional closing (18 [37 %]), institutional or household quarantine (15 [31 %]), or contact vaccination or chemoprophylaxis (12 [25 %]). This review indicates the need for central planning for pandemic influenza and for epidemiologic studies regarding containment strategies in the community. Much recent attention, public, governmental, and academic, has been focused on the possibility of an influenza pandemic, possibly arising from a mutated or genetically reassorted strain of the currently circulating avian influenza virus (H 5 N 1). In the United States, state and local health departments are primarily responsible for detecting an outbreak and implementing the public health response. Accordingly, individual states and the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) have each recently released pandemic influenza plans and guidelines.

In this study, we assessed whether data on RSV collected by the European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS) {{could be used to}} build an RSV surveillance system in Europe. Methods Influenza and RSV data for the 2002 – 2003 winter season were analysed for England, France, the Netherlands and Scotland. Data from <b>sentinel</b> <b>physician</b> networks and other sources, mainly hospitals, were collected. Respiratory specimens were tested for influenza and RSV mainly by virus culture and polymerase chain reaction amplification. Results Data on RSV were entered timely into the EISS database.

To {{estimate}} {{influenza vaccine}} effectiveness (VE) for the 2007 – 2008 season {{and assess the}} sentinel surveillance system in Canada for monitoring virus evolution and impact on VE. Methods. Nasal/nasopharyngeal swabs and epidemiologic details were collected from patients presenting to a <b>sentinel</b> <b>physician</b> within 7 days of influenza-like illness onset. Cases tested positive for influenza A/B virus by real-time polymerase chain reaction; controls tested negative. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and gene sequen-cing explored virus relatedness to vaccine.

Influenza virus was detected in 689 (48 %), of which iso-lates from 663 were typed/subtyped: 189 (29 %) were A/H 1, 210 (32 %) were A/H 3, and 264 (40 %) were B. Of A/H 1 N 1 isolates, 6 % showed minor HI antigenic mismatch to vaccine, with greater variation based on genetic identity. All A/H 3 N 2 isolates showed moderate antigenic mismatch, and 98 % of influenza B virus isolates showed major lineage-level mismatch to vaccine.

40|$|Introduction. Although {{influenza}} is {{longest and}} most studied infectious disease, to date, {{not much has}} been achieved in preventing and combating this disease. Many infectious diseases are now eliminated or significantly reduced, but only influenza remained epidemic and pandemic character. Influenza epidemics occur every year. Increase in number of patients occurs in early winter. Pandemics occur over long intervals of time and are caused by new subtypes of the influenza virus. Objective. To analyze the epidemiological characteristics of influenza through surveillance of influenza during 3 seasons of monitoring. Method. Data for the analysis were gathered from epidemiological surveillance of influenza through sentinel surveillance, virological surveillance and control of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. <b>Sentinel</b> <b>physician</b> network consisted of doctors from the public sector, general practitioners, pediatricians, and specialists of emergency medicine and pulmonologists from intensive care units. Supervisors were experts from the Institute of Public Health of Vojvodina, Novi Sad. Samples from the patients (nasopharyngeal swabs) were tested by PCR in National Reference Laboratories (Institute of Virology, Vaccines and Sera 'Torlak' in Belgrade) and in Institute of Public Health of Vojvodina). Results. During the pandemic season, based on the recorded incidence or intensity of clinical activity, incidence rate of the influenza virus infections was above the intermediate threshold (246. 3) for the territory of Vojvodina in the period from 45 th to 52 nd week of surveillance with the peak incidence at 50 th week (1090. 3 / 100, 000). In the next two seasons of sentinel surveillance intensity of virus activity threshold was above the average over the period of 4 to 10 weeks (season 2010 / 11) and of 11 to 13 weeks of surveillance (season 2011 / 12). The largest number of patients was registered in {{the age group of}} 5 - 14 years, and the lowest number of patients was in age group over 65. Summarized results of virological surveillance of influenza show that during the pandemic season the most frequent isolate was the virus influenza A (H 1 N 1). The largest number (24) of confirmed cases was registered in 51 st week of surveillance, which coincided with the highest activity of the virus influenza during sentinel surveillance of ILI. Within virological surveillance in the season 2010 / 11 out of total of 213 tested samples of patient material, infection was confirmed in 112 samples: influenza A (H 1 N 1) was confirmed in 90 % (101 / 112), type B in 6. 3 % (7 / 112) and influenza A (H 3 N 2) in 3. 6 % (4 / 112) samples. During the last season dominant infection was influenza A (H 3 N 2) with a share of 96. 5 % (55 / 57) of all confirmed cases of sentinel and non-sentinel specimens tested. The average age of the 38 patients with fatal outcome during the seasons 2009 / 10 and 2010 / 11 was 47. 1 (range: 12 to 76 years), and all were confirmed to infection with influenza virus A (H 1 N 1). Obesity had the largest share as a factor of comorbidity, and was registered in 36. 8 % (14 / 38) patients with fatal outcome. Conclusion. The influenza virus is constantly present in a population with different intensity from year to year. Disease is the most often registered in the preschool and school children, but fatalities due to influenza are usually registered among the working population...|$|E

Through logistic regression analysis the following variables were found to be significantly associated with HIV seropositivity: presence of HIV-related symptoms (prevalence odds ratio [POR] 36. 5), origin from an endemic area (POR 9. 1), homosexuality or bisexuality (POR 8. 4), intravenous drug use (POR 4. 2), male sex (POR 2. 8), previous HIV antibody testing (POR 2. 5) and previous sexually transmitted disease (POR 1. 8).

40|$|PROBLEM/CONDITION: In the United States, {{influenza}} epidemics occur {{nearly every}} winter and {{are responsible for}} substantial morbidity and mortality, including an average of approximately 114, 000 hospitalizations and 20, 000 deaths/year. REPORTING PERIOD: This report summarizes both actively and passively collected U. S. influenza surveillance data from October 1997 through September 2000. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: During each October-May in the period covered, CDC received weekly reports from 1) approximately 120 World Health Organization (WHO) and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) collaborating laboratories in the United States regarding influenza virus isolations; 2) approximately 230, 375, and 430 <b>sentinel</b> <b>physicians</b> during 1997 - 98, 1998 - 99, and 1999 - 00, respectively, regarding their total number of patient visits {{and the number of}} visits for influenza-like illness (ILI); and 3) state and territorial epidemiologists regarding estimates of local influenza activity. WHO collaborating laboratories also submitted influenza isolates to CDC for antigenic analysis. Throughout the year, the vital statistics offices in 122 cities reported weekly on deaths related to pneumonia and influenza (P&I). RESULTS: During the 1997 - 98 influenza season, influenza A(H 3 N 2) was the most frequently isolated influenza virus type/subtype. Influenza A(H 1 N 1) and B viruses were reported infrequently. The proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza peaked at 28 % in late January. The longest period of sustained excess mortality (when the percentage of deaths attributed to P&I exceeded the epidemic threshold) was 10 consecutive weeks. P&I mortality peaked at 9. 8 % in January. Visits for ILI to <b>sentinel</b> <b>physicians</b> exceeded baseline levels for 7 weeks and peaked at 5 % in mid-January through early February. A total of 45 state epidemiologists reported regional or widespread activity {{at the peak of the}} season. During the 1998 - 99 season, influenza A(H 3 N 2) viruses predominated; however, influenza B viruses were also identified throughout the United States. Influenza A(H 1 N 1) viruses were identified rarely. The proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza peaked at 28 % in early February. P&I mortality exceeded the epidemic threshold for 12 consecutive weeks and peaked at 9. 7 % in early March. Visits for ILI to <b>sentinel</b> <b>physicians</b> exceeded baseline levels for 7 weeks and peaked at 5 % in early through mid-February. Forty-three state epidemiologists reported regional or widespread activity at the peak of the season. During the 1999 - 00 season, influenza A(H 3 N 2) viruses predominated, but influenza A(H 1 N 1) and B viruses also were identified. The proportion of respiratory specimens testing positive for influenza peaked at 31 % in mid- to late December. The proportion of deaths attributed to P&I exceeded the epidemic threshold for 13 consecutive weeks and peaked at 11. 2 % in mid-January. Visits to <b>sentinel</b> <b>physicians</b> for ILI exceeded baseline levels 4 consecutive weeks and peaked at 6 % in late December. Forty-four state epidemiologists reported regional or widespread activity at the peak of the season. INTERPRETATION: Influenza A(H 1 N 1), A(H 3 N 2), and B viruses circulated during 1997 - 2000, but influenza A(H 3 N 2) was the most frequently reported virus type/subtype during all three seasons. Influenza A(H 3 N 2) is the virus type/subtype most frequently associated with excess P&I mortality. Influenza activity during all three seasons occurred at moderate to severe levels, and excess P&I mortality was reported during > or = 10 weeks each year. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS: CDC conducts active national surveillance during each October-May to detect the emergence and spread of influenza virus variants and to monitor influenza-related morbidity and mortality. Surveillance data are provided weekly throughout the influenza season to public health officials, WHO, and health-care providers and are used to guide vaccine strain selection, prevention and control activities, and patient care. Influenza vaccination is the most effective means for reducing the yearly effect of influenza. Typically, one or two of the influenza vaccine component viruses are updated each year so that vaccine strains will closely match circulating viruses. Surveillance data will continue to be used to select vaccine strains and to monitor the match between vaccine strains and the currently circulating viruses. " - p. 1 T. Lynnette Brammer, Erin L.

40|$|Abstract Background The European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS) has {{collected}} clinical and virological data on influenza since 1996 in {{an increasing number}} of countries. The EISS dataset was used to characterise important epidemiological features of influenza activity in Europe during eight winters (1999 – 2007). The following questions were addressed: 1) are the sentinel clinical reports a good measure of influenza activity? 2) how long is a typical influenza season in Europe? 3) is there a west-east and/or south-north course of peak activity ('spread') of influenza in Europe? Methods Influenza activity was measured by collecting data from sentinel general practitioners (GPs) and reports by national reference laboratories. The sentinel reports were first evaluated by comparing them to the laboratory reports and were then used to assess the timing and spread of influenza activity across Europe during eight seasons. Results We found a good match between the clinical sentinel data and laboratory reports of influenza collected by <b>sentinel</b> <b>physicians</b> (overall match of 72 % for +/- 1 week difference). We also found a moderate to good match between the clinical sentinel data and laboratory reports of influenza from non-sentinel sources (overall match of 60 % for +/- 1 week). There were no statistically significant differences between countries using ILI (influenza-like illness) or ARI (acute respiratory disease) as case definition. When looking at the peak-weeks of clinical activity, the average length of an influenza season in Europe was 15. 6 weeks (median 15 weeks; range 12 – 19 weeks). Plotting the peak weeks of clinical influenza activity reported by sentinel GPs against the longitude or latitude of each country indicated that there was a west-east spread of peak activity (spread) of influenza across Europe in four winters (2001 – 2002, 2002 – 2003, 2003 – 2004 and 2004 – 2005) and a south-north spread in three winters (2001 – 2002, 2004 – 2005 and 2006 – 2007). Conclusion We found that: 1) the clinical data reported by <b>sentinel</b> <b>physicians</b> is a valid indicator of influenza activity; 2) the length of influenza activity across the whole of Europe was surprisingly long, ranging from 12 – 19 weeks; 3) in 4 out of the 8 seasons, there was a west-east spread of influenza, in 3 seasons a south-north spread; not associated with type of dominant virus in those seasons. </p...|$|R

By mid-December, when southern hemisphere summer temperatures are favorable for the mosquito vector, the incidence began to rise dramatically into the first two months of 2006. The number of reported cases was thought to be underestimated. The French government sent several hundred troops to help eradicate mosquitoes.

Demographic characteristics, oseltamivir exposure, travel history and outcome {{were not significantly different}} between ose-S and ose-R patients. Among 133 households in the nested case-control study, secondary household attack rates in households with ose-R cases and households with ose-S cases were similar (23 versus 26 %; p-value= 0. 54). Ose-R household status and occurrence of secondary cases were associated with an odds ratio of 0. 85 (95 % confidence interval 0. 38 - 1. 88). We conclude that seasonal ose-R influenza A(H 1 N 1) viruses have transmitted well in the household setting...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate, within the Italian National Influenza Epidemiological and Virological Surveillance, the rate of vaccination coverage, the incidence of Influenza Like-Illness (ILI), the incidence of Acute Respiratory Illness (ARI), and to identify the virus strains circulating in Apulia from 1999 to 2003. METHODS: Vaccination coverage rates were calculated based on the number of doses administered to individuals > 65 years of age. Every week, <b>sentinel</b> <b>physicians</b> reported ILI and ARI cases having occurred among their patients. Voluntary general practitioners (GPs) and paediatricians (Ps) collected oropharyngeal swab samples from patients suspected with ILI. Influenza viruses were isolated and identified by cell culture (MDCK cells) and RT-PCR. Virological surveillance was carried out by the ISS, in collaboration with a network of peripheral laboratories. RESULTS: In Apulia, vaccination coverage progressively increased to 68. 6 % during the 2002 - 2003 season. The analysis of ILI cases showed higher incidence rates during the 1999 - 2000 and 2002 - 2003 seasons. ARI rates appeared to have a more constant trend. ILI and ARI incidence rates were higher in the 0 - 14 year age group. CONCLUSION: The increase in vaccination coverage rates and implementation of the network of clinical, and epidemiological and virological surveillance are fundamental for the control and prevention of influenza...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Sexual {{transmitted}} infections (STIs) {{have increased}} in Germany and other countries in Europe since the mid-nineties. To obtain a better picture of diagnostic methods used in STI testing institutions in Germany, we performed a nationwide survey amongst STI specialists in order to evaluate the quality of STI reports and provide recommendations to harmonize and possibly improve STI diagnostics in Germany. Methods We asked <b>sentinel</b> <b>physicians</b> and randomly chosen gynaecologists, urologists and dermato-venerologists, about the diagnostic methods used in 2005 to diagnose HIV, chlamydia (CT), gonorrhoea (GO) and syphilis (SY) in a national cross-sectional survey in order to recognize potential problems and provide recommendations. Results A total of 739 / 2287 (32 %) physicians participated. Of all participants, 80 % offered tests for HIV, 84 % for CT, 83 % for GO and 83 % for SY. Of all participants who performed HIV testing, 90 % requested an antibody test, 3 % a rapid test and 1 % a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT). For CT testing, NAAT was used in 33 % and rapid tests in 34 % of participants. GO resistance testing was performed by 31 % of the participants. SY testing was performed in 98 % by serology. Conclusions Diagnostic methods for STI vary highly among the participants. Diagnostic guidelines should be reviewed and harmonised to ensure consistent use of the optimal STI diagnostic methods. </p...|$|R
40|$|Early {{detection}} {{is fundamental}} for achieving effective control of infectious disease outbreaks. We described {{the development of}} a local chief complaint emergency department (ED) -based syndromic surveillance system to improve public health response in Genoa, Italy. The five syndromes under investigation by the syndromic surveillance system were influenza-like illness (ILI), low-respiratory tract illness (LRTI), not-haemorrhagic gastroenteritis, acute hepatitis, fever-with-rash (maculo-papular or vescicular) syndrome. Syndrome coding, data capture, transmission and processing, statistical analysis to assess indicators of disease activity and alert thresholds, and signal response were operatively described. Preliminary results on ILI syndromic surveillance showed that new system allowed the activation of the alert state with a specificity of 90. 3 % and a sensitivity of 72. 9 % in predicting epidemiological relevant events, such as > or = 10 accesses to ED for ILI in 3 days. The new syndromic surveillance system allowed to alert the public health institutions 2. 5 days before than the local surveillance system based on <b>sentinel</b> <b>physicians</b> and paediatricians, permitting the early activation of the necessary measures for the containment and for burden reduction of the epidemic event. It is noteworthy that the syndromic surveillance epidemic cut-off was overcome once before and 4 times after influenza outbreak detected by sentinel-based surveillance system: all episodes were contemporary with Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Parainfluenza Virus circulation, as detected by regional reference laboratory...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: We {{aimed to}} {{estimate}} the pooled vaccine effectiveness (VE) in children over five winters through data linkage of two existing surveillance systems. Methods: Five test-negative case–control studies were conducted from November to February during the 2004 / 2005 to 2008 / 2009 seasons. <b>Sentinel</b> <b>physicians</b> from the Viral Surveillance Network enrolled children aged 6 – 59 months with influenza-like illness to collect throat swabs. Through linking with a nationwide vaccination registry, we measured the VE with a logistic regression model adjusting for age, gender, and week of symptom onset. Both fixed-effects and random-effects models {{were used in the}} meta-analysis. Results: Four thousand four hundred and ninety-four subjects were included. The proportion of influenza test-positive subjects across the five seasons was 11. 5 % (132 / 1151), 7. 2 % (41 / 572), 23. 9 % (189 / 791), 6. 6 % (75 / 1135), and 11. 2 % (95 / 845), respectively. The pooled VE was 62 % (95 % confidence interval (CI) 48 – 83 %) in both meta-analysis models. By age category, VE was 51 % (95 % CI 23 – 68 %) for those aged 6 – 23 months and 75 % (95 % CI 60 – 84 %) for those aged 24 – 59 months.

40|$|We {{construct}} and verify a statistical method to nowcast influenza activity from a time-series {{of the frequency}} of reports concerning influenza related topics. Such reports are published electronically by both public health organizations as well as newspapers/media sources, and thus can be harvested easily via web crawlers. Since media reports are timely, whereas reports from public health organization are delayed by at least two weeks, using timely, open-source data {{to compensate for the}} lag in %E 2 % 80 % 9 Cofficial%E 2 % 80 % 9 D reports can be useful. We use morbidity data from networks of <b>sentinel</b> <b>physicians</b> (both the Center of Disease Control's ILINet and France's Sentinelles network) as the gold standard of influenza-like illness (ILI) activity. The time-series of media reports is obtained from HealthMap ([URL] We find that the time-series of media reports shows some correlation (0. 5) with ILI activity; further, this can be leveraged into an autoregressive moving average model with exogenous inputs (ARMAX model) to nowcast ILI activity. We find that the ARMAX models have more predictive skill compared to autoregressive (AR) models fitted to ILI data i. e., it is possible to exploit the information content in the open-source data. We also find that when the open-source data are non-informative, the ARMAX models reproduce the performance of AR models.

40|$|PROBLEM/CONDITION: Influenza {{epidemics}} occur {{nearly every}} {{year during the}} winter months and are responsible for substantial morbidity and mortality in the United States, including an average of approximately 114, 000 hospitalizations and 20, 000 deaths per year. REPORTING PERIOD: This report summarizes U. S. influenza surveillance data from October 1994 through May 1997, from both active and passive surveillance systems. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEM: During the period covered, CDC received weekly reports from October through May from a) state and territorial epidemiologists on estimates of local influenza activity, b) approximately 140 <b>sentinel</b> <b>physicians</b> on their total number of patient visits and the number of cases of influenza-like illness (ILI), and c) approximately 70 World Health Organization (WHO) collaborating laboratories in the United States on weekly influenza virus isolations. WHO collaborating laboratories also submitted influenza isolates to CDC for antigenic analysis. Throughout the year, vital statistics offices in 121 cities reported deaths related to pneumonia and influenza (P&I) weekly, providing a measure of the impact of influenza on mortality. RESULTS: During the 1994 - 95 influenza season, 25 state epidemiologists reported regional or widespread activity {{at the peak of the}} season. Cases of ILI reported by <b>sentinel</b> <b>physicians</b> exceeded baseline levels for 4 weeks, peaking at 5 %. Influenza A(H 3 N 2) was the most frequently isolated influenza virus type/subtype. The longest period of sustained excess mortality was 5 consecutive weeks, when the percentage of deaths attributed to P&I exceeded the epidemic threshold, peaking at 7. 6 %. During the 1995 - 96 season, 33 state epidemiologists reported regional or widespread activity at the peak of the season. ILI cases exceeded baseline levels for 5 weeks, peaking at 7 %. Influenza A(H 1 N 1) viruses predominated, although influenza A(H 3 N 2) and influenza B viruses also were identified throughout the United States. P&I mortality exceeded the epidemic threshold for 6 consecutive weeks, peaking at 8. 2 %. The 1996 - 97 season was the most severe of the three seasons summarized in this report. Thirty-nine state epidemiologists reported regional or widespread activity at the peak of the season. ILI reports exceeded baseline levels for 5 consecutive weeks, peaking at 7 %. The proportion of respiratory specimens positive for influenza peaked at 34 %, with influenza A(H 3 N 2) viruses predominating. Influenza B viruses were identified throughout the United States, but only one influenza A(H 1 N 1) virus isolate was reported overall. The proportion of deaths attributed to P&I exceeded the epidemic threshold for 10 consecutive weeks, peaking at 9. 1 %. INTERPRETATION: Influenza A(H 1 N 1), A(H 3 N 2), and B viruses circulated during 1994 - 1997. Local surveillance data are important because of geographic and temporal differences in the circulation of influenza types/subtypes. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS: CDC conducts active national surveillance annually from October through May for influenza to detect the emergence and spread of influenza virus variants and monitor the impact of influenza-related morbidity and mortality. Surveillance data are provided weekly throughout the influenza season to public health officials, WHO, and health-care providers and can be used to guide prevention and control activities, vaccine strain selection, and patient care.

40|$|Background: The {{transmission}} of influenza viruses occurs {{person to person}} and is facilitated by contacts within enclosed environments such as households. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate secondary attack rates and factors associated with household {{transmission of}} laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09 in the pandemic and post-pandemic seasons. Methods: During the 2009 – 2010 and 2010 – 2011 influenza seasons, 76 <b>sentinel</b> <b>physicians</b> in Navarra, Spain, took nasopharyngeal and pharyngeal swabs from patients diagnosed with influenza-like illness. A trained nurse telephoned households of those patients who were laboratory-confirmed for influenza A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09 to ask about the symptoms, risk factors and vaccination status of each household member. Results: In the 405 households with a patient laboratory-confirmed for influenza A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09, 977 susceptible contacts were identified; 16 % of them (95 % CI 14 – 19 %) presented influenza-like illness and were considered as secondary cases. The secondary attack rate was 14 % in 2009 – 2010 and 19 % in the 2010 – 2011 season (p = 0. 049), an increase that mainly affected persons with major chronic conditions. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the risk of being a secondary case was higher in the 2010 – 2011 season than in the 2009 – 2010 season (adjusted odds ratio: 1. 72; 95 % CI 1. 17 – 2. 54), and in children under 5 years, with a decreasing risk in older contacts.
