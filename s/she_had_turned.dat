25|$|In late 1957, Howes {{was offered}} the part (for the third time) to enable Andrews to join the cast of the London production. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> it down twice before. The first offer had been to join the USA touring company of the musical, and the second time she {{declined}} the part was due to her film commitment for Admirable Crichton (1957). With the persistence of Lerner and Loewe, however, she accepted the third time, for a year's contract, but at a higher salary than Julie Andrews. She became an instant hit as a very fiery Eliza Doolittle.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Binoche {{returned}} to the screen in a big-budget adaptation of Jean Giono's The Horseman on the Roof directed by Jean-Paul Rappeneau. The film was particularly significant in France as {{it was at the}} time the most expensive film in the history of French cinema. The film was a box-office success around the world and Binoche was again nominated for a César for Best Actress. This role, as a romantic heroine, was to color the direction of many of her subsequent roles in the late 1990s. In 1996, Binoche appeared in her first comedic role since My Brother-in-Law Killed My Sister a decade before; A Couch in New York was directed by Chantal Akerman and co-starred William Hurt. This screw-ball comedy {{tells the story of a}} New York psychiatrist who swaps homes with a Parisian dancer. The film was a critical and commercial failure. Three Colors: Blue, The Horseman on the Roof and A Couch in New York all gave Binoche the opportunity to work with prestigious directors <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> down during the prolonged shoot of Les Amants du Pont-Neuf.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} of the 1995 European Cup, Janss was one of the more senior players in the {{national}} squad, and was appointed captain in place of Nicola Payne. In the first match against England, she opened the batting with Jiska Howard and hit a team-high 44 from 166 balls. She followed up with 27 against Ireland and 29 against Denmark, with the Netherlands recording a rare ODI win in the latter fixture. Despite Janss's run of form, Payne returned as captain for the team's next ODI series, against Denmark in July 1997. Payne promoted herself to open the batting with Janss, and in the first ODI the pair put on 83, with Janss contributing a career-high 47 runs. In the next match, a ten-wicket victory, the pair put on 147 not out, setting a Dutch record that is yet to be beaten. Janss played her final tournament for the Netherlands at the 1997 World Cup in India, by which time <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> 32. She finished her career with 301 runs from 21 ODIs, the most scored by a Dutchwoman without a half-century to her name.|$|E
500|$|In 1886, Dowling {{returned}} to his native England. Giving up {{her work as a}} governess, Fuller began to paint full-time, and had opened her own studio before <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> twenty. Dowling had intended to return to Australia and had left behind an incomplete portrait of the Victorian governor's wife, Lady Loch. He died, however, not long after arriving in England; Fuller then completed Dowling's commission. Lady Loch became her patron. Other early portraits followed: two pictures of homeless children, entitled Weary (inspired by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's poem on child labour [...] "Weariness") and Desolate, in 1888; and Gently Reproachful circa 1889. Weary was acquired by the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 2015.

500|$|Despite the support, the resignations ended Eddy's time in Lynn. The {{church was}} {{struggling}} and her reputation had {{been damaged by}} the disputes. By now 61 years old, she {{decided to move to}} Boston, and in early 1882 rented a house at 569 Columbus Avenue, a silver plaque announcing the arrival of the Massachusetts Metaphysical College. The college's prospectus, published in 1884, offered three diplomas: Christian Scientist (C.S.) for Christian Scientists' Association members; Christian Metaphysician (C.M.) for Eddy's 12-lesson course and three years' practice; and Doctor of Christian Science (D.C.S.) for C.M.s whose [...] "life and character conform to Divine science." [...] Students could study metaphysics, science of the scriptures, mental healing and obstetrics, using two textbooks, Science and Health and the Bible. Between 1881 and October 1889, when Eddy closed the college, 4,000 students took the course at $300 per person or married couple, making her a rich woman.

500|$|... on July 15, 1936. Immediately {{upon arrival}} in Germany, Brundage became {{headline}} news {{when he and}} the AOC dismissed swimmer Eleanor Holm Jarrett, a gold medalist in 1932 and expected to repeat, for activities on shipboard. Rumors and accounts of the married swimmer's pursuits on board vary, but include statements that she was at an [...] "all-night party" [...] with playwright Charles MacArthur, who was traveling without his wife, actress Helen Hayes. Brundage discussed the matter with fellow AOC members, then met with Jarrett. Although the AOC attempted to send her home, Jarrett, after pleading in vain for reinstatement, remained in Berlin as a journalist, [...] "to the AOC's horror". In later years, she claimed that Brundage had kicked her off the team because he had propositioned her, and <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> him down. According to Guttmann, [...] "Brundage has appeared, ever since , {{in the guise of}} a killjoy." [...] Butterfield noted that through the efforts of sportswriters who supported Jarrett, [...] "Brundage became celebrated as a tyrant, snob, hypocrite, dictator and stuffed shirt, as well as just about the meanest man in the whole world of sports".|$|E
500|$|In Lightning Returns, Juba criticized Lightning's lack of {{personal}} growth during the narrative, and IGN's Marty Silva felt that her increased coldness makes her [...] "downright unlikable." [...] VanOrd argued that Lightning is not [...] "interesting {{in and of}} herself" [...] and that <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> into [...] "a vessel for holding and pouring plot devices", whose stoicism {{makes it difficult for}} the player to connect with her. Parrish, writing for USGamer, stated that Lightning had become [...] "downright apathetic", showing [...] "no personality whatsoever", and that this clashed with the ability to dress her in costumes. By contrast, Parkin commented that certain side quests, such as herding sheep or retrieving a girl's doll, helped to humanize Lightning and make her likable. Similarly, Destructoid's Dale North found that the costumes and dialogue lighten her character: he argued that these elements make her less [...] "flat and lifeless now, which is a big improvement." [...] Dave Riley of Anime News Network felt that Lightning's stoic attitude, although out of place in XIII and XIII-2, fit her role as a god's servant in Lightning Returns.

500|$|One of {{the main}} goals of {{invariant}} theory was to solve the [...] "finite basis problem". The sum or product of any two invariants is invariant, and the finite basis problem asked whether {{it was possible to}} get all the invariants by starting with a finite list of invariants, called generators, and then, adding or multiplying the generators together. For example, the discriminant gives a finite basis (with one element) for the invariants of binary quadratic forms. Noether's advisor, Paul Gordan, was known as the [...] "king of invariant theory", and his chief contribution to mathematics was his 1870 solution of the finite basis problem for invariants of homogeneous polynomials in two variables. He proved this by giving a constructive method for finding all of the invariants and their generators, but was not able to carry out this constructive approach for invariants in three or more variables. In 1890, David Hilbert proved a similar statement for the invariants of homogeneous polynomials in any number of variables. Furthermore, his method worked, not only for the special linear group, but also for some of its subgroups such as the special orthogonal group. His first proof caused some controversy because it did not give a method for constructing the generators, although in later work he made his method constructive. For her thesis, Noether extended Gordan's computational proof to homogeneous polynomials in three variables. Noether's constructive approach made it possible to study the relationships among the invariants. Later, after <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>turned</b> to more abstract methods, Noether called her thesis [...] (crap) and Formelngestrüpp (a jungle of equations).|$|E

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the sensational 1957 trial, Scott was {{forgotten}} by the media. Despite later claims that Scott's film career was ruined by the Confidential scandal, by the time the September 1955 issue of Confidential appeared, her career was already dormant. Scott had begun her career {{at a time when many}} established actors were away at war, giving then unknowns like Scott a chance at stardom. When the older stars returned, many of the newer stars faded away. In addition, the rise of television and the breakup of the studio system further curtailed film production. Film historians generally agree that Scott's career essentially peaked between 1947 and 1949. By February 1953, her stage fright was such that she even hid from friends. Scott did not renew her Paramount contract in February 1954, 18 months before [...] "Lizabeth Scott in the Call Girls' Call Book" [...] was published.
