According to Cable, she opened Rimsky-Korsakoffee [...] "to stop cleaning [...] house for music parties," [...] having hosted classical music events in her home for years prior. Her vision was an unconventional and [...] "homelike" [...] restaurant, attractive to conversationalists who enjoy beer, desserts and music. Cable has established business hours that work for her and prioritizes [...] "conversation, creation, education, game playing and enjoying nature". She insists on recycling whenever possible and is adamant that the coffeehouse will [...] "never" [...] have a sign to advertise the business. In 2008, Cable <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that locating in Portland was what made the business successful: [...] "I don't think Rimsky's would have worked anyplace else...

I wanted to do something different before I went back on TV." [...] However, she soon decided that the play was [...] "too Alan Ayckbourn", threw it away and began writing the second run instead. [...] She aimed to write 18 minutes of script a week. In the end it took six months to complete, an experience she did not enjoy. [...] "You pour everything you've got into one sketch and you don't ever want to write another - only you realise there are fifty-nine more to go before you've got enough for a series, it's torment".|$|E

Jolie {{initially}} believed Zahara {{to be an}} AIDS orphan, based on official testimony from her grandmother, but her birth mother later came forward in the media. She explained that she had abandoned her family when Zahara became sick, and <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> Zahara was [...] "very fortunate" [...] to have been adopted by Jolie. Jolie was accompanied by her partner, Brad Pitt, when she traveled to Ethiopia to take custody of Zahara.

After Pitt announced his intention to adopt her children, she filed a petition to legally change their surname from Jolie to Jolie-Pitt, which was granted on January 19, 2006.

[...] She thought that Scotty's lines were [...] "unforgettable" [...] and the scenes between McCoy and Spock were [...] "priceless". [...] Eugene Myers and Torie Atkinson {{reviewed}} the episode for Tor.com in April 2010. They described it as [...] "easily the most celebrated episode of the entire original series (if not the whole franchise)". They went on to describe it as a [...] "perfect episode", and both gave it maximum scores of six out of six. Jamahl Epsicokhan at [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] said that the team behind Star Trek were [...] "at {{the top of their}} game" [...] with this episode.

500|$|Paul Lester of The Guardian {{described}} OutKast's lyrical style on {{the album}} by saying, [...] "They are, in a way, post-hip-hop, combining PM Dawn's kooky confections with the Pharcyde's hallucinatory whimsy, Public Enemy's hardline politicking with De La Soul's cartoon dementia, to fashion something vital and new." [...] The album commonly features the words [...] "stank" [...] and [...] "smell" [...] in their blues definition to mean [...] "low-down, blunt, pungent: a measure of authenticity". The group often incorporates word play into the lyrics, including references to the [...] "underground smellroad" [...] and chants of [...] "I stank I can, I stank I can", an allusion to The Little Engine That Could. [...] The song [...] "Red Velvet" [...] discusses the materialistic nature of the hip-hop scene. [...] "Humble Mumble" [...] addresses critics who make negative assumptions about hip-hop based on preconceived notions; André 3000 raps in the song: [...] "I met a critic/I made her shit her draws/She <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> hip-hop was only guns and alcohol/I said oh hell naw/but yet it's that too/You can't discrima-hate cause you done read a book or two." ...|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Zack Handlen {{reviewed}} the episode for the A.V. Club, noting that while the episode wasn't subtle, it did [...] "a good job expanding the show's world, and playing off of undercurrents and themes which have been built in throughout DS9 first season." [...] He described Winn as the [...] "most unsettling of enemies, a true believer whose faith doesn't prevent her from manipulation and deceit". [...] Handlen described the character of Vedek Winn as [...] "terrific". In her analysis of the episode, Michelle Erica Green of TrekNation <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> the episode was [...] "pretty fantastic" [...] when she originally watched it. Upon re-watching it years later, she thought it had improved even further. Green described the episode as [...] "a no-holds-barred story about the hypocrisy of religious leaders which seems less influenced by the Scopes Trial than by contemporary creationist politicians." [...] She described Fletcher as one of her favourite actresses and thought that she portrayed Vedek Winn as the older sister of Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.|$|E
500|$|Lennon became {{convinced}} that the Maharishi, {{who said he was}} celibate, had made a pass at Farrow or was having relations with other young female students and later called the Maharishi a [...] "lecherous womaniser". [...] According to Mardas an American teacher named Rosalyn Bonas had told both him and Lennon that the Maharishi had made [...] "sexual advances" [...] towards her. However, Cynthia Lennon <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> Mardas had put the [...] "young and impressionable" [...] girl up to it. Brown recalls that Mardas told him that a young blonde nurse from California had said she'd had a sexual relationship with the Maharishi. In addition, Mardas arranged to spy on the Maharishi when Bonas was with him, and said that he saw the two of them in a compromising position. At the same time, {{many of the people who}} were there, including Harrison, Horn, Cooke de Herrera, Cynthia Lennon and Jennie Boyd did not believe that the Maharishi had made a pass at any woman. According to Cynthia Lennon, Mardas' allegations about the Maharishi's indiscretions with a lady gained momentum [...] "without a single shred of evidence or justification." [...] Likewise McCartney said [...] "It was Magic Alex who made the original accusation and I think that it was completely untrue".|$|E
500|$|Kurt's {{scenes with}} Blaine {{and with his}} father evoked very {{divergent}} opinions from reviewers. Canning made mention of [...] "a great conversation between Blaine and Kurt that felt very real for kids in this situation" [...] and noted he was [...] "glad it wasn't an easy talk for either of them". The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson agreed, and said of their [...] "debate over the existence of bisexuality" [...] that [...] "it was refreshing to see Glee portray a conversation like it really goes down in reality. It’s also good to see them not treat Kurt like such a saint all the time." [...] Semigran wrote that Kurt showed [...] "an unflattering side of himself", and Gonzalez stated that she [...] "was completely on Blaine's side here": Kurt [...] "wasn't fair" [...] and [...] "was sort of unlikable" [...] for once, though she did add that [...] "he's allowed to be flawed". Blaine's [...] "sudden confusion over his sexual orientation" [...] was deemed a [...] "false note" [...] by Reiter, who called his [...] "overwrought speech" [...] at the Lima Bean [...] "off-key". Harper was unhappy that [...] "major plot points like a gay character thinking he might be bi or straight get instigated, sorted out and wrapped up within an hour", and <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> it was [...] "hurtful" [...] for Blaine to [...] "accept a date with Kurt's friend" [...] after he and Kurt had [...] "agreed to sort of work on a potential {{relationship between the two}} of them" [...] in the [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] episode.|$|E

Amelia Heinle, who critics praised for her portrayal of Victoria, has been listed on the [...] "Top 5 Actresses" [...] poll of CBS Soaps In Depth for over eight consecutive weeks. [...] Her relationship with Billy has garnered a significant fan following, allowing them to lead CBS Soaps In Depths [...] "Top 10 Couples" [...] poll for over six consecutive weeks. Elinor Donahue, who portrayed the judge that marries Victoria and Billy, <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> their [...] "retro wedding" [...] was [...] "adorable" [...] and [...] "extremely well written and not overdone". Zap2it placed Victoria and Billy at number four of their [...] "10 Best Soap Couples of 2011". Jamey Giddens of Zap2it said Victoria and Billy are [...] "so scrumptious together", and that [...] "it's so nice to have some reason to say something kind about The Young and the Restless for a change". Giddens {{also said that he}} [...] "adores this pairing that he was so prepared to hate". Sara Bibel of Xfinity wrote of their relationship: [...] "Billy (Billy Miller) and Victoria (Amelia Heinle), who have already had three weddings in the year and a half that they have been together, actually seem rational. They should change the wedding vows in the G.C. from [...] "until death to us part," [...] to [...] "until one of us changes our mind." [...] However, Bibel was later unfavorable of the couple attempting to have a child less than six months after marrying.|$|E
500|$|While {{the film}} was not {{initially}} a box-office success, it gained popularity through numerous re-releases and was even voted as [...] "the best anime in history" [...] by the readers of Animage. Following a July 1992 release by Streamline Pictures, Janet Maslin <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> the film [...] "should fare nearly as well [...] with animation fans of any age, provided they are unwavering in their devotion to the form and do not think 100 minutes is an awfully long time." [...] According to Maslin, the film is an [...] "interestingly wild hybrid of visual styles and cultural references" [...] whose [...] "animation is weak {{when it comes to}} fluid body movements, but outstanding in its attention to detail." [...] According to Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle, [...] "C of C refrains from the Technicolor ultra-violence that helped make films like , Akira, and Vampire Hunter D such audience favorites, and instead focuses on broad, almost slapstick humor and chaos to keep viewers riveted. Sometimes it works, and unfortunately, sometimes it doesn't." [...] review aggregator RottenTomatoes gies the film a 90% approval rating based on reviews from 10 critics. Some fans maintain {{that it is not a}} [...] "true" [...] Lupin title, due to Miyazaki's altering of the titular character into a bumbling hero, rather than his original ruthless criminal self. Monkey Punch, creator of Lupin III, called Castle of Cagliostro an [...] "excellent" [...] movie, but agreed Miyazaki's vision of Lupin differs from his own. He said, [...] "I wouldn't have had him rescue the girl, I would have had him rape her!" ...|$|E
500|$|Goddard {{compared}} the romance between Lily and Cane to Lady Chatterley's Lover since both characters grew and {{learned from the}} relationship. Cane developed an attraction to Heather Stevens (portrayed by Vail Bloom) while with Lily; Goddard noted it would [...] "come down to what Cane needs" [...] when choosing between the two women. The storylines written for the lovers included a controversy with the characters' age gap, a miscarriage, and a love rectangle with Chloe Mitchell (Elizabeth Hendrickson) and Billy Abbott (Billy Miller). Within the love rectangle story, Chloe tricks Cane into thinking they conceived a child together. To make the storyline work, the writers scripted Cane as less intelligent, a strategy they used previously during his storyline with Amber. To keep the character from looking bad, Goddard said he made acting choices to justify Cane's actions. Despite the lessening of the character's intelligence, Goddard said he liked the story because of the originality of the plot. Love triangles and questioned paternity happen regularly in soap operas, but he felt that former head writer Maria Arena Bell managed to make those conventions fresh and new. Khalil stated that she [...] "loved" [...] the storyline, also saying she loved the actors involved in it. Khalil <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> it [...] "was a possibility" [...] for Lily and Cane to have a happy ending, and that Lily [...] "can see the hope, and they can adapt and love {{each other in a}} more mature and honest way". Cane married Lily in 2009, and the following year, Global BC called Lily the love of Cane's life. In 2011, Lily divorced Cane after he continued to lie to her about his faked death. However, she eventually discovered Cane was trying to protect her, and they were remarried. Goddard commented that their relationship [...] "had come full circle" [...] and [...] "was being done well". Of Cane and Lily's second wedding, Goddard stated that Cane and Lily have [...] "certainly had a lot of ups and downs", but he thought through all of that their fans [...] "stayed true and they have expressed their desire for what they want to see". Goddard also thought their wedding of [...] "this caliber" [...] would make their fans [...] "very, very happy and that is what this is about".|$|E

These comments were made after the jury deadlocked 10-2 in favor of acquittal in a case involving U.S. Marine William Lawrence Havey. Linda Dunn, a chief deputy district attorney in Riverside County, <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> the outcome of the Havey trial {{had more to do with}} jurors' unwillingness to convict a Marine than with negative perceptions of the Perverted Justice witnesses.|$|E

2500|$|In 2015, Bowser's allies formed FreshPAC, a {{political}} action committee intended to advance her agenda. The initiative was the first PAC in District politics so closely aligned with a sitting mayor and created by a former campaign treasurer. Thanks to a legislative loophole regulating off-year fundraising, FreshPAC accepted unlimited contributions. Bowser supporters had quickly raised more than $300,000 and had a goal of collecting $1 million by year’s end. FreshPAC was chaired by Earle “Chico” Horton III, a lobbyist for a major corporation that sought Bowser's support. [...] Many of the highest donors participated in a trip to China with the mayor. Following outcry from the Washington Post, members of the D.C. Council, and other stakeholders, FreshPAC was shut down in November 2015.

Manson <b>said</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> about abandoning the music business as soon as 2008, when her mother developed dementia, and later died, saying that [...] "I didn't want to make music, didn't feel creative. I could barely function." [...] Later that year she reconsidered her words and went back into performing after being asked by friends to sing David Bowie's [...] "Life on Mars?"
