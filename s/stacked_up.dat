Structures can {{be far more}} elaborate than a single thin film: films can be <b>stacked</b> <b>up</b> to give strong iridescence, to combine two colours, or to balance out the inevitable change of colour with angle to give a more diffuse, less iridescent effect. Each mechanism offers a specific {{solution to the problem}} of creating a bright colour or combination of colours visible from different directions.|$|E

Approximately 1.6million tonnes of {{domestic}} waste and commercial waste were {{dumped in the}} site during its four-year operation. The disposed waste <b>stacked</b> <b>up</b> to 65 metres high. After its closure in 1981, it was sealed with soil and planted over with Grasslands and trees. Sin Fat Road, which runs {{up the hill and}} hosts Sceneway Garden Minibus Terminus, was constructed. Sai Tso Wan Landfill was later rebuilt into Sai Tso Wan Recreation Ground.|$|E
5|$|Shells {{are used}} decoratively in many ways. They can be pressed into {{concrete}} or plaster to make decorative paths, steps or walls {{and can be}} used to embellish picture frames, mirrors or other craft items. They can be <b>stacked</b> <b>up</b> and glued together to make ornaments. They can be pierced and threaded onto necklaces or made into other forms of jewellery. Shells have had various uses in the past as body decorations, utensils, scrapers and cutting implements. Carefully cut and shaped shell tools dating back 32,000 years have been found in a cave in Indonesia. In this region, shell technology may have been developed in preference to the use of stone or bone implements, perhaps because of the scarcity of suitable rock materials.|$|E
40|$|AbstractGeometric {{dimensioning}} and Tolerancing (GDT) {{constitutes the}} dominant approach for design and manufacture of mechanical parts that control inevitable dimensional and geometrical deviations within appropriate limits. The <b>stack</b> <b>up</b> of tolerances and their redistribution without hampering the functionality {{is very important}} for cost optimization. This paper presents a methodology that aims towards the systematic solution of tolerance <b>stack</b> <b>up</b> problem involving geometric characteristics. Conventional tolerance <b>stack</b> <b>up</b> analysis is usually difficult as it involves numerous rule and conditions. The methodology presented i. e. generic capsule method is straightforward and easy to use for <b>stack</b> <b>up</b> of geometrical tolerances of components and their assembly using graphical approach. In the work presented in this paper, angularity tolerance has been considered for illustration of the methodology. Two approaches viz. Worst Case (WC) and Root Sum Square (RSS) have been used. An example of dovetail mounting mechanism has been taken for purpose of <b>stack</b> <b>up</b> of angularity. This assembly consists of two parts i. e. dovetail male and dovetail female. Tolerance <b>stack</b> <b>up</b> has been done both for the components and their assembly. Need for computerisation of methodology for geometrical tolerance <b>stack</b> <b>up</b> of large assemblies has emerged out as the limitation of the proposed method...|$|R

25|$|A few Hyderabads {{fell back}} to the next {{battalion}} (Lt.Col.Cecil Deakin's 5/2nd Punjab Regiment) alerting the Punjabis to the tanks heading towards their position. Shimada lost his two leading tanks to land mines and Boys anti-tank rifles {{in front of the}} more experienced Punjabi position. The Punjabis then managed to set fire to another tank with Molotov cocktails, effectively blocking the road and leaving the Japanese column <b>stacked</b> <b>up,</b> almost bumper to bumper. If the British artillery (who were not contacted due to the communication lines being cut) had been called in {{at this point in the}} battle, Shimada's column could have been easily stopped due to their <b>stacked</b> <b>up</b> and vulnerable position, surrounded by thick jungle on the narrow road. This golden opportunity for the British was lost and Shimada's infantry were able to push through Deakin's Punjabis, while the tanks found an unguarded loop road that enabled them to by-pass the destroyed tanks. The Punjabis had held Shimada until around 6 am in heavy fighting. Deakin and a handful of his remaining Punjabis managed to escape across the Slim River, but most of his battalion were mopped up by the 42nd Regiment.|$|E

Gang members and miscreants covered interior walls with graffiti and damaged doors, windows, and elevators. Rat and cockroach infestations were commonplace, rotting garbage <b>stacked</b> <b>up</b> in clogged trash chutes (it once piled {{up to the}} 15th floor), and basic utilities (water, electricity, etc.) often malfunctioned and were left unrepaired. On the exterior, boarded-up windows, burned-out areas of the façade, and pavement instead of green space—all {{in the name of}} economizing on maintenance—created an atmosphere of decay and government neglect. The balconies were fenced in to prevent residents from emptying garbage cans into the yard, and from falling or being thrown to their deaths. This created the appearance of a large prison tier, or of animal cages, which further enraged community leaders of the residents.|$|E

500|$|There was one vice-presidential {{debate between}} Congresswoman Ferraro and Vice President George H. W. Bush. Held on , {{the result was}} proclaimed mostly even by the press and historians; women voters tended to think Ferraro had won, while men, Bush.

Her experience was questioned at the debate and she was asked how her three terms in Congress <b>stacked</b> <b>up</b> with Bush's extensive government experience. To one Bush statement she said, [...] "Let me just say first of all, that I almost resent, Vice President Bush, your patronizing attitude {{that you have to}} teach me about foreign policy."

500|$|In {{the last}} week of July, the London Bill of Mortality showed 3,014 deaths, of which 2,020 had died from the plague. The number of deaths as a result of plague may have been underestimated, as deaths in other years in the same period were much lower, at around 300. As the number of victims {{affected}} mounted up, burial grounds became overfull, and pits were dug to accommodate the dead. Drivers of dead-carts travelled the streets calling [...] "Bring out your dead" [...] and carted away piles of bodies. The authorities became concerned that the number of deaths might cause public alarm and ordered that body removal and interment should take place only at night. As time went on, there were too many victims, and too few drivers, to remove the bodies which began to be <b>stacked</b> <b>up</b> against the walls of houses. Daytime collection was resumed and the plague pits became mounds of decomposing corpses. In the parish of Aldgate, a great hole was dug near the churchyard, fifty feet long and twenty feet wide. Digging was continued by labourers at one end while the dead-carts tipped in corpses at the other. When {{there was no room for}} further extension it was dug deeper until ground water was reached at twenty feet. When finally covered with earth it housed 1,114 corpses.|$|E
