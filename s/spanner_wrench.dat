25|$|This marble obelisk {{is on top}} of {{a square}} base with three reliefs on it. The south side of the base has a relief of Benjamin Grenup {{at the time of his}} death. The relief shows Grenup being run over by a fire water wagon and his fellow firefighters {{reacting}} to the accidental death—one has his arms in the air while the other firefighters stop the wagon. The west side of the base has a relief of a fire hose and two nozzles. The east side has a relief of a fire axe, torch and <b>spanner</b> <b>wrench</b> tied together with a rope. Egg-and-dart motif along with garland and ribbons decorate the sculpture. The sculpture sits on a triangle plot surrounded by a fence. Fire hydrants sit at each of the three corners of the base.|$|E
25|$|The upper {{segment of}} the grooved wheel, made of {{hardened}} steel, projects through a slot cut to its precise dimensions {{in the base of}} the priming pan. The wheel is grooved on its outside circumference with three or more V-shaped grooves with transverse cuts at intervals to provide a friction surface for the iron pyrites. The wheel is fixed to a shaft, one end of which projects outside the lockplate. The outside projection is of square section to permit a <b>spanner</b> (<b>wrench)</b> to be engaged for subsequent tensioning of the lock. The other end of the shaft fits {{through a hole in the}} lockplate, and on this end is forged a cam, or eccentric. One end of a short, robust chain (made of three or four flat, parallel links like a short piece of bicycle chain) is fixed to the cam, while the other end of the chain is held in a groove at the end of the longer branch of a large heavy V-spring, which is generally retained by a screw and a headed bracket through upstands inside the lockplate.|$|E

50|$|The {{automatic}} transmission model {{would soon be}} discontinued, with only 700 built; it was widely criticized, it was too difficult for Soviet drivers to maintain, there were few service stations {{to do the work}} and few private mechanics qualified, and there was a shortage of transmission oil. From 1958, a three-speed manual, with synchromesh on the top two gears, was the only transmission available; this would be the M21V, while the taxi became the M21A. (The automatic would be used in the low-production GAZ-13 Chaika, which would also be maintained by professionals.) Standard equipment on all models included spare parts and two tool kits, with <b>spanners,</b> <b>wrenches,</b> screwdrivers, a tire pump, and a cans of paint to fix minor dings.|$|R
50|$|In {{event of}} an irretrievably snagged or damaged {{umbilical}} and a need for in-water decompression, the original umbilical can be detached from helmet and harness and a replacement fitted in the water by a standby diver. The method is simple - the new umbilical is secured to the diver's harness, the diver goes onto bailout, the gas supply on the original umbilical is shut down, and the umbilical connections are disconnected using the appropriate <b>spanners</b> (<b>wrenches).</b> The replacement gas supply hose is blown through to clear it of water, and fitted to the helmet. Communications cables are usually suitable for wet-connection, and {{this can be done}} if desired. The original umbilical may be disconnected from the harness and cleared from the diver if this will help.|$|R
50|$|In North American English, wrench is the {{standard}} term. The most common shapes are called open-end wrench and box-end wrench. In American English, spanner refers to a specialised wrench {{with a series of}} pins or tabs around the circumference. (These pins or tabs fit into the holes or notches cut into the object to be turned.) In American commerce, such a wrench may be called a <b>spanner</b> <b>wrench</b> to distinguish it from the British sense of spanner.|$|E

5000|$|In 1901 Frank Hornby, a clerk from Liverpool, England, invented and {{patented}} a new toy called [...] "Mechanics Made Easy" [...] {{that was}} based on the principles of mechanical engineering. It was a model construction kit consisting of perforated metal strips, plates and girders, with wheels, pulleys, gears, shaft collars and axles for mechanisms and motion, and nuts and bolts and set screws to connect the pieces. The perforations were at a standard ½ inch (12.7 mm) spacing, the axles were 8-gauge, and the nuts and bolts used 5/32 inch BSW threads. The only tools required to assemble models were a screwdriver and <b>spanners</b> (<b>wrenches).</b> It {{was more than just a}} toy: it was educational, teaching basic mechanical principles like levers and gearing.|$|R

5000|$|... (To simplify matters, {{the term}} hexagon {{will be used}} in this {{paragraph}} to denote either bolt head or nut.) Whitworth (spanner) markings refer to the bolt diameter rather than the distance across the flats of the hexagon (A/F) as in other standards. Confusion also arises because BSF hexagon sizes can be one size smaller than the corresponding Whitworth hexagon. This leads to instances where a <b>spanner</b> (<b>wrench)</b> marked 7/16BSF is the same size as one marked 3/8W. In both cases the spanner jaw width of 0.710 in, the width across the hexagon flat, is the same. However, in World War II the size of the Whitworth hexagon was reduced to {{the same size as the}} equivalent BSF hexagon purely to save metal during the war and they never went back to the old sizes afterwards. Thus it is today uncommon to encounter a Whitworth hexagon which takes the nominally correct spanner. Spanners in this case may be marked 7/16BS to indicate that they have a jaw size of 0.710 in and are designed to take either the (later) 7/16 BSW or 7/16 BSF hexagon.|$|E

A removal tool follower stabilizes the upper portion of the legs to allow a <b>spanner</b> <b>wrench</b> to be used for insertion and removal...|$|E
5000|$|The first bolts had square heads, {{formed by}} forging. These are still found, {{although}} {{much more common}} today is the hexagonal head.

50|$|In Commonwealth English (excluding Canada), spanner is the {{standard}} term. The most common shapes are called open-ended spanner and ring <b>spanner.</b> The term <b>wrench</b> is generally used for tools that turn non-fastening devices (e.g. tap wrench and pipe wrench), or {{may be used for}} a monkey wrench - an adjustable spanner.|$|R
40|$|We numerically {{model the}} axial {{trapping}} forces within optical tweezers arising from Laguerre-Gaussian laser modes. For an 8 mu m diameter sphere suspended in water, the higher-order modes produce an axial trapping force several {{times larger than}} that of the fundamental. Partial absorption results in a transfer of the orbital angular momentum from the Laguerre-Gaussian mode to the trapped particle. This results in the rotation of the particle by what may be called an optical <b>spanner</b> (<b>wrench).</b> For an absorption coefficient of alpha = 5700 m(- 1) and a laser power of 10 mW, we find that an 8 mu m diameter sphere would acquire an angular acceleration of 10 x 10 (4) rad s(- 2) and a limiting angular velocity of 0. 2 rad s(- 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Engineers are {{tasked with}} {{designing}} new systems {{every day to}} meet changing or unexpected technical requirements. After the tragic explosion of the Space Shuttle Challenger on January 28, 1986, NASA engineers embarked on a complete overhaul of many of their long-standing quality systems and procedures. When the official cause of the accident {{was determined to be}} an O-ring failure in the right Solid Rocket Booster, NASA's Shuttle Program initiated a thorough redesign of the rocket boosters' clevis ends, which are the O-ring's mating surfaces. One of the unique systems that NASA engineers developed {{as a result of this}} effort included a heating assembly that is coupled to the outside of the rocket boosters. When the assembly is affixed to the external surface of the boosters, the very nature of its design allows for the warming of the O-rings prior to launch. After the engineers completed the assembly's design, however, they found that it was nearly impossible to tighten the spanner nuts required for attaching the system, given the minimum amount of clearance they had in the limited and confined space. Under these circumstances, the standard wrenches typically used for tightening these types of nuts did not work, and there were no other existing devices to solve the problem. NASA engineers embraced the challenge, developing a torque wrench tool adapter that allowed for a full rotation of spanner nuts in confined spaces. The tool, which is similar to an open-ended crowfoot wrench and a fixed-face <b>spanner</b> <b>wrench,</b> contains two dowel pins that center and lock the wrench onto the nut...|$|E
50|$|The blade {{is usually}} clamped into {{position}} using {{a pair of}} wingnuts. Although wing nuts are usually intended for operation without tools it is often impossible to apply sufficient force purely by hand. Wingnut <b>spanners</b> (US English: <b>wrenches)</b> greatly increase the torque that may be applied, ensuring that the blade is securely clamped.|$|R
30|$|These results {{demonstrate}} that bolts achieve good stability {{at the half}} pin–Rancho cube interface by tolerating higher axial loads than grub screws before loosening. This is a result from the greater torque that can be produced using a <b>spanner</b> or <b>wrench.</b> Whilst the point profile of the grub screw secures a better hold of the half pin when the torque used is equal, the driver used to insert the grub screw is limited in delivery of a high maximum torque before breakage; {{this appears to be}} the limiting factor for the security of hold on the half pin by grub screws.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States and Canada, the {{adjustable}} <b>spanner</b> (adjustable <b>wrench)</b> is colloquially {{referred to}} as a [...] "crescent wrench" [...] due to the widespread Crescent brand of adjustable wrenches. The Crescent brand of hand tools is owned and marketed by [...] Apex Tool Group, LLC. In some parts of Europe, adjustable spanners are often called a Bahco. This term refers to the company of the Swedish inventor Johan Petter Johansson, which was originally called B.A. (Bernt August) Hjort & Company. The Swedes themselves call the key [...] "skiftnyckel" [...] which is translated into adjustable key (shifting key).|$|R
50|$|Some {{screwdrivers}} {{have a short}} hexagonal {{section at}} the top of the blade, adjacent to the handle, so that a ring <b>spanner</b> or open <b>wrench</b> can be used to increase the applied torque. The offset screwdriver has a handle set at right angles to the small blade, providing access to narrow spaces and giving extra torque.|$|R
50|$|It is {{distinguished}} from other bolts by its shallow mushroom head {{and that the}} shank cross-section of the bolt is circular {{for most of its}} length, as usual, but the portion immediately beneath the head is formed into a square section. This makes the bolt self-locking when placed through a square hole in a metal strap, or a round hole in most wood. This allows the fastener to be installed with only a single tool, a <b>spanner</b> or <b>wrench,</b> working from one side. The head of a carriage bolt is usually a shallow dome. The squared section is of {{the same size as the}} diameter of the bolt shank, with a plain unthreaded shank.|$|R
50|$|This {{can be done}} on a show-by-show basis, or as a {{resident}} position of a specific theatre. The tool of the trade of the theatrical master electrician is the adjustable <b>spanner</b> or crescent <b>wrench,</b> used to secure stage lighting instruments from lighting positions in the theatre. This wrench is typically attached to the belt or wrist with a lanyard, which is important because the master electrician tends to work at great height, from ladders, lift tables, catwalks, or lighting trusses, where a falling wrench may hurt people or damage property below.|$|R
30|$|We have {{simulated}} {{clinical conditions}} {{by use of}} saw bone models; we recruited subjects with experience in mounting frames and instructed them to assemble these constructs {{in a manner similar}} to their clinical practice. In the first part of the experiment, loosening torque values were determined. These are not the same as the tightening torque values as different forces are involved (static vs dynamic). Values obtained demonstrate statistically significant higher loosening torque values when bolts are used to secure half pins. This suggests a higher torque is applied when half pins are secured with bolts. We surmise the difference is due to a <b>wrench</b> (<b>spanner)</b> being used in contrast to the straight hex driver for grub screws. The axial compression force (clamp force) applied through either bolt or grub screw would determine the security of hold at the half pin–Rancho cube interface. This clamp force is affected by many other variables too: the bolt diameter. The type and number of threads on the bolt, the bolt material and the torque applied. The last variable is that under control by the surgeon and may influence the likelihood of these constructs to failure.|$|R

Her entire iron hull is encrusted with coral and overrun by fishes (and the local barracuda named Fang), and the cracks and crevices of her wreckage provide excellent habitats for lobsters, eels, and octopi. Her wreckage was also featured in the 1977 filming of The Deep, including a scene of Jacqueline Bisset diving in a T-shirt.The wreck has been well treated over the years. There {{used to be a}} full set of <b>wrenches</b> (<b>spanners),</b> still visible on the deep part (each wrench being about 4 ft long and weighing over [...] ). In recent decades the largest of these were stolen by a collector, leaving only the smaller wrenches. Also remaining are a few brass portholes and even a silver teaspoon. The remaining wrenches are under 55 ft of water. Similarly the wreck features the [...] "lucky porthole", a brass porthole in the stern section which survived the storm intact and remains shiny by divers rubbing it for good luck. This porthole is considered [...] "lucky" [...] because the glass still survives. For many years a popular resident of the wreck was a 500 lb Goliath grouper also known as a Jew fish, but two ex-pat fishermen with spear guns killed it despite spear guns being illegal for non-nationals and the area being a national park. Today the wreck is visited by hundreds of tourists every day, most of whom are more circumspect in their treatment of the site.|$|R
