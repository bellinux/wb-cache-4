Episodic <b>sediment</b> <b>yields</b> after large eruptions have been evaluated, but not the long-term and continuous patterns on persistently active volcanoes. We have used high-spatial resolution satellite imagery and DEMs/DSMs along with field-based geologic mapping to assess accurately sediment budgets for the active Semeru Volcano in Java, Indonesia. Patterns of aggradation and degradation on Semeru differ from that of other active volcanoes because (1) both episodic pyroclastic density currents (PDC) and continuous supplies of tephra generate pulses of sediment, (2) sediment is transferred via cycles of aggradation and degradation that continue for > 15 years in river channels after each PDC-producing eruption, and (3) rain-triggered lahars remove much greater material than fluvial transport during long, intense rainfall events. The geomorphic response of two of Semeru’s rivers to volcanic sediment migration indicates that (1) each river experiences alternating aggradation and degradation cycles following PDC-producing eruptions and (2) spatial patterns of sediment transfer are governed by geomorphic characteristics of the river reaches. Usually high degradation in the steep source reach is followed by a long bypassing middle reach. Aggradation predominates in the depositional reaches further down valley on the ring plain. Average <b>sediment</b> <b>yields</b> (103 – 105 t/km 2 /year) at persistently active volcanoes are two to three orders of magnitude lower than <b>sediment</b> <b>yields</b> after large and infrequent eruptions, but the continuous and steady sediment transfer in rivers removes more sediment on a mid-term (10 years) to long-term (30 years) basis.

The June 1991 {{eruption}} of Mount Pinatubo, Philippines, {{was the second}} largest of the 20 th century, emplacing 5 [...] 6 km 3 of pyroclastic-flow material and creating record high <b>sediment</b> <b>yields</b> on rivers draining the volcano. This thesis explores landscape response to and recovery from sediment loading in the 1991 eruption from the drainage basin scale to mobility of individual clasts on the bed. Basin-scale erosion patterns were studied on the Pasig-Potrero and Sacobia Rivers for one decade following the eruption using digital elevation models, multispectral imagery, geomorphic terrain maps, and field observations. In {{the latter half of}} the decade, channel recovery was examined more closely through a multi-year field campaign on five east side basins measuring flow and channel parameters, grain size distributions, roughness, sediment mobility, and sediment transport. The details of bed coarsening and sediment transport under conditions similar to those at Mount Pinatubo were explored through physical experiments modeling future conditions as sand is depleted. <b>Sediment</b> <b>yields</b> on the Pasig-Potrero and Sacobia Rivers declined exponentially for the first decade following the eruption. Decay coefficients were inversely correlated with initial sediment loading. Erosion of pyroclastic flow deposits from valley incision, widening, and extension dominated <b>sediment</b> <b>yields</b> as early as 1991. Ten years later, <b>sediment</b> <b>yields</b> remained 20 times higher than pre-eruption levels. In the most disturbed basins, mainstem channels were braided and highly mobile. Coarse clasts moved independently over a smooth bed of sand and fine gravel. As <b>sediment</b> <b>yields</b> declined, selective transport preferentially removed sand and pumice, starting in the upper basin, causing downstream fining and gradients in pumice content. As sand content on the bed declined, coarse clasts interacted, leading to cluster formation and decreasing clast mobility. As sand content declines, bed reorganization into coarse and fine patches enables transport rates to remain high over a wide range of sand contents. In the near future, <b>sediment</b> <b>yields</b> on the Pasig-Potrero and Sacobia Rivers should remain elevated rather then declining to pre-eruption levels, sending an additional 14 million m 3 of sediment downstream in the second decade after the eruption...|$|R

The theoretical concept of the 'sediment delivery ratio' (ratio between yield and total amount of sediment eroded) captures {{the fact that not}} all of the sediment is eroded within a certain catchment that reaches out to the outlet (due to, for example, deposition on floodplains). Such storage opportunities are typically increased in catchments of larger size, thus leading to a lower yield and sediment delivery ratio.|$|E

40|$|Many {{studies of}} global <b>sediment</b> <b>yields</b> have ignored SE Asia, {{probably}} because the land area is only 2 % of the global total. However, {{it has been suggested}} that up to 70 % of the sediment entering the oceans comes from SE Asia and Oceania. To test such estimates one would normally calculate total yields from many measured rivers but there are very few relevant data for the region. A possible solution is to use algorithms which estimate <b>sediment</b> <b>yields</b> based on factors such as elevation, local relief, area, climate and runoff. To assess the value of different algorithms we first compared their predictions to known yields using a global data set tabulating a range of basin variables. All were poor predictors, but using a subset of the global data, based on rivers from SE Asia, there is an improved correlation between observed and calculated yields. However, the data set is small and the rivers may not be representative of the entire region. Bearing in mind these reservations, different algorithms were used to estimate <b>sediment</b> <b>yields</b> from SE Asia. Calculations can be performed quickly with a GIS because most parameters can be extracted from published maps and digital elevation models. We used the HYDRO 1 K database of hydrologically consistent drainage information based on the USGS GTOPO 30 DEM. ERMapper and MapInfo were used to extract the essential parameters. <b>Sediment</b> <b>yields</b> were calculated for 650 basins and for the main island groups. The total estimated sediment discharge from SE Asia is between 1500 and 5000 million t/yr, between two thirds and twice that of the Himalayas.

40|$|To {{potentially}} better identify {{variability in}} <b>sediment</b> <b>yields</b> under {{a range of}} forest management and climatic scenarios at the catchment scale, alternative approaches by modelling <b>sediment</b> <b>yields</b> were utilised in this research using: (1) a spatially distributed calibrated algorithm of soil loss coupled with sediment delivery ratio (SDR) functions; (2) linear regression models between sampling suspended sediment concentrations and corresponding instantaneous variables of streamflow and in-stream turbidity; and (3) a physically-based SWAT model. Four catchments in Kangaroo River State forest, northern NSW were assessed for annual changes in <b>sediment</b> <b>yields.</b> Two catchments were selectively logged in 2007 while the two other sites remained undisturbed. Instantaneous changes in streamflow and suspended sediment constituents were systematically monitored between 2001 and 2009 as part of native forest management activities in the forested catchments. In addition, water samples were collected by autosamplers to cover {{a wide range of}} water constituent variability. According to the different methods applied in this research, rainfall intensity had the most significant influence on sediment delivery, streamflow and <b>sediment</b> <b>yields</b> at channel outlets in all catchments, with steeply sloping areas contributing large amounts of sediment during moderate and high rainfall years in 2007 and 2009. Slope gradient was found to contribute substantially to the spatial variability of soil loss estimation across the catchments. The impact of vegetation removal was minimal even during high rainfall conditions in the 2007 logging year.
