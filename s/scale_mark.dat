50|$|There is a {{complete}} description of this theodolite in the final report of the Anglo-French Survey (1784-1790). The instrument was large, 36 inches (914 mm) across and it was normally mounted on a stand which placed the sighting telescope between 5 and 6 ft. high. It weighed about 200 lb (90 kg) and the accessories and cases weighed as much again. It travelled around Britain for over sixty years, in its own sprung carriage, to locations where it was hauled up mountains, church towers and even scaffolded steeples. The horizontal circular scale was divided very accurately with divisions at 15 minute (of arc) intervals using one of Ramden's own dividing engines; the marks on the 36 inch diameter scale would be about 1/6 inch (4 mm) apart. The position of the telescope could therefore be read to the nearest quarter of a degree by eye but the exact position between the divisions was read {{with the aid of}} micrometer microscopes fitted with adjustable cross wires in the focal plane, as shown. The threads of the screws were such that fifteen full turns moved from one <b>scale</b> <b>mark</b> to the next, i.e. 15 minutes, and since the scale on the adjusting knob allowed one sixtieth of a turn to be measured the resulting accuracy was within one arc second.|$|E

Our results provide specific, detailed estimates of the dispersal characteristics of released 'genetically sterile' male Aedes aegypti in the field.

Moreover, we recruited 47 non-consanguineous relatives who did not suffer alcohol related disorders and underwent the same tests. In both groups we genotyped 11 genetic variations (rs 1800587; rs 3087258; rs 1799724; 5 -HTTLPR; rs 1386493; rs 1386494; rs 1487275; rs 1843809; rs 4570625; rs 2129575; rs 6313) located in genes whose impact on alcohol related behaviors and disorders has been hypothesized (IL 1 A, IL 1 B, TNF, 5 -HTTLPR, TPH 2 and HTR 2 A). We analyzed the epistasis of these genetic variations upon the biological and psychological dimensions in the cases and their relatives. Further on, we analyzed the effects of the combined genetic variations on the short – term detoxification treatment efficacy. Finally, being the only not yet investigated variation within this sample, we analyzed the impact of the rs 6313 alone on baseline assessment and treatment efficacy. We detected the following results: the couple rs 6313 + rs 2129575 affected the Leyton -Trait at admission (p = 0. 01) (obsessive-compulsive trait), whilst rs 1800587 + 5 -HTTLPR impacted the Pilowski test at admission (p = 0. 01) (hypochondriac symptoms). These results did not survive Bonferroni correction (p ≤ 0. 004). This lack of association may depend on the incomplete gene coverage or on the small sample size which limited the power of the study. On the other hand, it may reflect a substantial absence of relevance of the genotype variants toward the alcohol related investigated dimensions. Nonetheless, the marginal significance we detected could witness an informative correlation worth investigating in larger samples...|$|E
40|$|A simple, easy-to-use {{optoelectronic}} tool projects <b>scale</b> <b>marks</b> {{that become}} incorporated into photographic images (including film and electronic images). The sizes of objects {{depicted in the}} images can readily be measured by reference to the <b>scale</b> <b>marks.</b> The {{role played by the}} <b>scale</b> <b>marks</b> projected by this tool is {{the same as that of}} the <b>scale</b> <b>marks</b> on a ruler placed in a scene for the purpose of establishing a length scale. However, this tool offers the advantage that it can put <b>scale</b> <b>marks</b> quickly and safely in any visible location, including a location in which placement of a ruler would be difficult, unsafe, or time-consuming. The tool (see Figure 1) includes an aluminum housing, within which are mounted four laser diodes that operate at a wavelength of 670 nm. The laser diodes are spaced 1 in. (2. 54 cm) apart along a baseline. The laser diodes are mounted with setscrews, which are used to adjust their beams to make them all parallel to each other and perpendicular to the baseline. During the adjustment process, the effect of the adjustments is observed by measuring the positions of the laser-beam spots on a target 80 ft (approx. 24 m) away. Once the adjustments have been completed, the laser beams define three 1 -in. (2. 54 -cm) intervals and the location of each beam is defined to within 1 / 16 in. (approx. 1. 6 mm) at any target distance out to about 80 ft (approx. 24 m). The distance between the laser-beam spots as seen in an image is strictly defined only along an axis parallel to the baseline and perpendicular to the laser beam (also perpendicular to the line of sight of the camera, assuming that the camera-to-target distance is much greater than the distance between the tool and the camera lens). If a flat target surface illuminated by the laser beams is tilted with respect to the aforesaid axis, then the distance along the target surface between <b>scale</b> <b>marks</b> is proportional to the secant of the tilt angle. If one knows the tilt angle, one can correct for it. Even if one does not know the tilt angle precisely, it may not matter: For example, at a tilt of 10, the secant is approximately 1. 0154, so that the tilt error is only about 1. 54 percent, which is negligibly small for a typical application in which only approximate measurements are needed...|$|R
