Keyring variants of rock monsters sent with monthly Lego magazine subscriptions have a fixed metal <b>screw</b> <b>eye</b> {{through the top}} of the head, and do not open. The <b>screw</b> <b>eye</b> can not be removed. It rotates, but does not withdraw from the plastic. Although there is a method of removing the metal screw.|$|E
50|$|Kubotan (sometimes erroneously spelled as kubaton or kobutan) is a genericized {{trademark}} for a self-defense keychain weapon {{developed by}} Sōke Takayuki Kubota {{in the late}} 1960s. It is typically no more than 5.5 inches (14 centimetres) long and about half an inch (1.25 centimetres) in diameter, slightly thicker or {{the same size as}} a marker pen.

The body of the Kubotan is lined with six round grooves with a <b>screw</b> <b>eye</b> or swivel and split ring attachment at one end for keys.|$|E
50|$|<b>Screw</b> <b>eyes</b> are a <b>screw</b> with a loop {{on one end}} and threads on {{the other}} end. <b>Screw</b> <b>eyes</b> are {{commonly}} used to attach cables to objects, for instance attaching a string {{to the back of}} a painting to allow the painting to hang from a nail on a wall. Long-shanked <b>screw</b> <b>eyes</b> are termed 'vine eyes' and are used to attach support wires to wooden fence posts when growing soft fruit or grape vines, the plants then being tied to the wires.|$|R

Like wire eye bolts, wire eye lags are {{intended}} for light duty applications {{and should not be}} used for angular loads.|$|R
6000|$|While {{these words}} were being spoken, I saw <b>Screw's</b> <b>eyes</b> {{wandering}} discontentedly and amazedly round the room. He {{had left me}} in it with the doctor before he went out: was he disappointed at not finding me in it on his return? ...|$|R
50|$|A cabin hook is a {{hooked bar}} that engages into a staple. The bar is usually {{attached}} permanently to a ring or staple that is fixed with screws or nails to woodwork or a {{wall at the}} same level as the <b>eye</b> <b>screw.</b> The <b>eye</b> <b>screw</b> is usually screwed into the adjacent wall or onto the door itself. Used to hold a cupboard, door or gate open or shut.|$|R
5000|$|Other control {{methods were}} devised {{early on to}} avoid having to pay {{royalties}} on the [...] "U-Control" [...] patent, including systems with the lines connected directly to the elevator with pulleys to change the pitch, methods that connected the lines directly to the pushrod through <b>screw</b> <b>eyes,</b> but most worked very poorly compared to conventional 2-line control.|$|R

50|$|The Frankenstrat {{has gone}} through a number of necks over the years, and its bridge has evolved from the 1958 Fender tremolo to {{original}} Floyd Rose bridges (with and without fine tuners). The placement of the 1971 quarter was to keep the Floyd Rose bridge flush with the body, and Van Halen attached truck reflectors {{to the rear of the}} body for decoration. He installed large <b>screw</b> <b>eyes</b> instead of strap buttons, a foolproof (albeit unsightly) method of securing the guitar to the strap.|$|R
60|$|A {{perfectly}} lovely {{little black}} Berkshire pig stood smiling beside him. She had twinkly little <b>screwed</b> up <b>eyes,</b> a double chin, {{and a short}} turned up nose.|$|R
50|$|After his arrest, Hinds {{brought a}} lawsuit against {{authorities}} charging the prison commissioners with illegal arrest and used the incident {{as a means to}} plan his next escape by having a padlock smuggled in to him while at the Law Courts. Two guards escorted him to the toilet, but when they removed his handcuffs Hinds bundled the men into the cubicle and snapped the padlock onto <b>screw</b> <b>eyes</b> that his accomplices had earlier fixed to the door. He escaped into the crowd on Fleet Street but was captured at an airport five hours later.|$|R
6000|$|She {{leaned back}} in her chair and, <b>screwing</b> her <b>eyes</b> tight, began the calculation. [...] "Twelve noughts are nought," [...] she said, in a gabbling whisper; [...] "twelve noughts are nought, twelve fours are forty—" ...|$|R
60|$|Davy <b>screwed</b> his <b>eyes</b> tight {{shut and}} seemed to meditate on this for a time. Then he crawled up and put his arms about Anne's neck, snuggling his flushed little face down on her shoulder.|$|R

50|$|CO2 dragsters are {{miniature}} racing cars {{which are}} propelled by a carbon dioxide cartridge, pierced {{to start the}} release of the gas, and which race on a typically 60 foot track. They are frequently used to demonstrate mechanical principles such as mass, force, acceleration, or aerodynamics. Two hooks (eyelets or <b>screw</b> <b>eyes)</b> linked to a string (usually monofilament fishing line) the bottom of the car prevent the vehicle from losing control during launch. In a race, a laser scanner records the speed of the car {{at the end of its}} run. Often, the dragster is carved out of balsa wood because of its light weight.|$|R

6000|$|I {{had some}} {{experience}} of American appreciation; I liked a little of it, but there is too much; {{a little of that}} {{would go a long way}} to spoil a man; and I like myself better in the woods. I am so damned candid and ingenuous (for a cynic), and so much of a [...] "cweatu' of impulse--aw" [...] (if you remember that admirable Leech) that I begin to shirk any more taffy; I think I begin to like it too well. But let us trust the Gods; they have a rod in pickle; reverently I doff my trousers, and with <b>screwed</b> <b>eyes</b> await the amari aliquid of the great God Busby.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{of course}} not. Don't you know us {{enough to know}} how we behave? No scenes,--that would be a relief. However, I never make them myself, and I never will--that's one comfort for you, for the future, {{if you want to}} know. Father and mother keep very quiet, looking at me as if I were one of the lost, with hard, <b>screwing</b> <b>eyes,</b> like gimlets. To me they {{scarcely}} say anything, but they talk it all over with each other, and try and decide what is to be done. It's my belief that father has written to the people in Washington--what do you call it! the Department--to have you moved away from Brooklyn,--to have you sent to sea." ...|$|R
6000|$|After much <b>screwing</b> of his <b>eyes,</b> {{for those}} {{characters}} were very minute, Champollion Mohi thus spoke--" [...] Except-the-tribe-of-Hamo." ...|$|R

60|$|Razumov {{gazed down}} at her with silent, scrutinizing attention. Her puffy yellow countenance was working with emotion. She <b>screwed</b> up her <b>eyes</b> at him entreatingly.|$|R
6000|$|Jakin {{threw out}} his chest, which Lew smote {{with all his}} might, Jakin turned very pale, gasped, crowed, <b>screwed</b> up his <b>eyes</b> and said,--"That's all right." ...|$|R

60|$|She {{sat back}} and <b>screwed</b> her <b>eyes</b> tight, as she had always done when puzzled. Something had {{happened}} to her, but how it had happened and when it had happened and why it had happened she could not understand. She only knew that {{now for the first}} time she had been granted a moment of clear vision and was seeing things truly.|$|R
