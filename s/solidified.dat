5|$|This was a fast-spreading rift; the {{resulting}} basalts show little {{interaction with the}} then-existing rock. These immense volumes of mafic lava were generated in two major pulses, mostly via a hot mantle plume. Along the North Shore of Lake Superior, {{one can see the}} <b>solidified</b> lava (igneous rock) most everywhere. In the Rove region the magma didn't reach the surface; it intruded into fractures in the formation and slowly cooled to become diabase (rather than basalt). These <b>solidified</b> bodies are the Pigeon River and Logan Intrusion diabases.|$|E
5|$|However, that meaning {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the process of accretion forming the planets. In this context, accretion refers to the process of cooled, <b>solidified</b> grains of dust and ice orbiting the protostar in the protoplanetary disk, colliding and sticking together and gradually growing, up to and including the high-energy collisions between sizable planetesimals.|$|E
5|$|The {{classical}} elements {{change into}} one another by a process of condensation and rarefaction.

It takes many years to <b>solidify</b> a memory into the brain. During the process of <b>solidifying</b> a memory repetition is key, because when an action is repeated the action is engraved into the brain for a short amount of time. The more times it is repeated the easier it will be to <b>solidify</b> the memory.|$|R
5|$|Vesta, the next-most-massive {{body in the}} {{asteroid}} belt after Ceres, is roughly spherical, deviating mainly because of massive impacts that formed Rheasilvia and Veneneia crater after it <b>solidified.</b> Furthermore, its triaxial dimensions are not consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|As {{the desert}} {{mountains}} decay, {{large areas of}} shattered rock and rubble occur. The process continues and the end products are either dust or sand. Dust is formed from <b>solidified</b> clay or volcanic deposits whereas sand results from the fragmentation of harder granites, limestone and sandstone. There is a certain critical size (about 0.5mm) below which further temperature-induced weathering of rocks does not occur and this provides a minimum size for sand grains.|$|E

40|$|The {{relative}} {{fractions of}} ferrite and austenite that <b>solidify</b> from {{a stainless steel}} (SS) alloy oepend on the alloy composition and the solidification rate. Many common SS-alloy microstructures consist of a mixture of ferrite and austenite phases; however, when these alloys are rapidly resolidified using laser-beam (LB} or electron-beam (EB) processes, they <b>solidify</b> as single-phase austenite or single-phase ferrite. This paper investigates the influence of solidification rate on the reduction, and eventual elimination, of second phases during the rapid solidification of two Fe-Ni-Cr alloys. One alloy <b>solidifies</b> in the primary austenitic mode, and its ferrite content decreases to 0 % with increasing solidification rate. The other alloy <b>solidifies</b> in the primary ferritic mode, and its ferrite content increases to 100 % with increasin...|$|R

This was Florida's first victory over Georgia in seven match-ups and <b>solidified</b> the Gators as legitimate contenders for their first-ever conference title. Two Bulldogs' fumbles, and two Gators pass plays, accounted for Florida's four touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|British Governor Valentine Morris and {{military}} commander Lieutenant Colonel George Etherington disagreed {{on how to}} react and ended up surrendering without significant resistance. Both leaders were subjected to inquiries over the surrender.

The area remained under Carib control until the Second Carib War of 1795.|$|E
5|$|In 1374, Tvrtko married Dorothea, {{daughter}} of Tsar Ivan Stratsimir of Bulgaria. The marriage was likely arranged by Louis, who had kept Dorothea {{and her sister}} as honored hostages at his court to ensure Ivan Stratsimir's loyalty. The bride was Orthodox, but the marriage was celebrated in the Catholic rite by Tvrtko's old enemy Peter, Bishop of Bosnia, to whom Tvrtko then awarded large tracts of land. Tvrtko thereby <b>solidified</b> his relations with the Roman Catholic Church and earned recognition from Pope Gregory XI.|$|E
25|$|The <b>solidifying</b> {{behavior}} {{depends on}} the alloy composition. Pure metals <b>solidify</b> at a certain temperature, forming crystals of one phase. Eutectic alloys also <b>solidify</b> at a single temperature, all components precipitating simultaneously in so-called coupled growth. Non-eutectic compositions on cooling start to first precipitate the non-eutectic phase; dendrites when it is a metal, large crystals when it is an intermetallic compound. Such a mixture of solid particles in a molten eutectic {{is referred to as}} a mushy state. Even a relatively small proportion of solids in the liquid can dramatically lower its fluidity.|$|R

After Stephen Malkmus heard demos recorded by Pa, the songs turned into a Pavement project. The recording session for Demolition J-7 was more difficult than for Slay Tracks due to tension between producer Gary Young and Fawkes. The EP received favorable reception from critics and fans, and <b>solidified</b> the band's cult fanbase.|$|E

40|$|The {{article is}} devoted to the problem of {{providing}} mining enterprises with <b>solidifying</b> filling mixtures at underground mining. The results of analytical studies using the data of foreign and domestic practice of <b>solidifying</b> mixtures delivery to stopes are given. On the basis of experimental practice the parameters of transportation of <b>solidifying</b> filling mixtures are given with an increase in their quality due to the effect of vibration in the pipeline. The mechanism of the delivery process and the procedure for determining the parameters of the forced oscillations of the pipeline, the characteristics of the transporting processes, the rigidity of the elastic elements of pipeline section supports and the magnitude of vibrator’ driving force are detailed. It is determined that the quality of <b>solidifying</b> filling mixtures can be increased due to the rational use of technical resources during the transportation of mixtures, and as a result the mixtures are characterized by a more even distribution of the aggregate.
