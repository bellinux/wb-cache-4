5000|$|Syrian {{nationalism}}, {{also known}} as Pan-Syrian nationalism, refers to the nationalism of the region of Syria, or the Fertile Crescent as a cultural or political entity known as [...] "Greater Syria". It {{should not be confused}} with the Arab nationalism that is the official state doctrine of the <b>Syrian</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>Republic's</b> ruling <b>Arab</b> Socialist Ba'ath Party, nor should it be assumed that Syrian nationalism necessarily propagates the interests of modern-day Syria or its government. Rather, it predates the existence of the modern Syrian state (independent from French colonial rule in 1946), and refers to the loosely defined Levantine region of Syria, known in Arabic as [...] "al-Sham".|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{traces the}} {{evolution}} of Arab nationalism in Syria from 1908 to 1920. It attempts to determine when Arab nationalism was accepted as {{the primary focus of}} political 1 oya 1 ty by the <b>Syrian</b> <b>Arabs</b> during this period and what reasons prompted the <b>Syrian</b> <b>Arabs</b> to support Arab nationa 1 ism. It was found that during the years from 1908 to 1918 Arab nationa 1 sim as a po 1 itica 1 force came into being in Syria and was embraced by a few <b>Syrian</b> <b>Arabs.</b> At this time, however, the majority of <b>Syrian</b> <b>Arabs</b> of all classes rejected Arab nationalism and maintained their po 1 itica 1 allegiance to the Ottoman Empire.

5|$|After taking {{power in}} the 1963 Syrian coup d'état, officially the 8th of March Revolution, a power {{struggle}} broke erupted between the Nasserites in the National Council for the Revolutionary Command and the Ba'ath Party. The Nasserites sought to reestablish the United <b>Arab</b> <b>Republic,</b> the former federation encompassing Egypt and Syria from 1958 to 1961, on Gamal Abdel Nasser's terms, the Ba'athists were skeptical of a new union with Nasser, and wanted a loose federation where the Ba'ath Party could rule Syria alone without interference. The Nasserites mobilised large street demonstrations in favour of a union. It took time before the Ba'ath Party knew {{how to respond to}} the issue, since the majority of <b>Syrian</b> <b>Arab</b> Nationalists were not adherents to Ba'athism, but of Nasserism and Nasser in general.|$|R

25|$|The 4th National Congress, held in August 1960, {{criticized the}} {{leadership}} of Aflaq and Bitar, called for the reestablishment of the Syrian Regional Branch and deemphasized the party's commitment to Arab nationalism while emphasizing more the socialist character of the party. A year after, at the UAR's nadir in Syria, the Syrian General Abd al-Karim al-Nahlawi launched a coup on 28 September 1961, {{which led to the}} reestablishment of the <b>Syrian</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>Republic.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{nature of}} the {{conflict}} has shifted over the years from the large-scale, regional Arab–Israeli conflict to a more local Israeli–Palestinian conflict, which peaked during the 1982 Lebanon War. The interim Oslo Accords {{led to the creation}} of the Palestinian National Authority in 1994, within the context of the Israeli–Palestinian peace process. The same year Israel and Jordan reached a peace accord. A cease-fire has been largely maintained between Israel and Baathist Syria, as well as with Lebanon since 2006. However, developments in the course of the Syrian Civil War reshuffled the situation near Israel's northern border, putting the <b>Syrian</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>Republic,</b> Hezbollah and the Syrian opposition at odds with each other and complicating their relations with Israel.|$|E
25|$|United Nations Peacekeeping {{started in}} 1948 when the United Nations Security Council {{authorised}} {{the deployment of}} UN unarmed military observers to the Middle East in order to monitor the armistice agreement that was signed between Israel and its Arab neighbours {{in the wake of}} the Arab-Israeli War. This operation was called the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization (UNTSO) and is still in operation today. With the passage of resolution 73 (1949) by the Security Council in August 1949, UNTSO was given the task of fulfilling four Armistice Agreements between the state of Israel and the Arab states which had participated in the war. Thus, UNTSO’s operations were spread through five states in the region—Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon and the <b>Syrian</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>Republic.</b>|$|E

25|$|Founded {{at the end}} of World War II, the Muslim Brotherhood of Syria {{was seen}} as one of several {{important}} political parties in the 1950s. When Syria unified with Egypt to form the United Arab Republic, the disbanding of the Muslim Brotherhood as a political party was a condition of union, one complicated by Gamal Abdel Nasser's conflict in Egypt with the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. The Syrian Muslim Brotherhood was banned by the government of the <b>Syrian</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>Republic</b> starting after the 1963 coup by the secularist, pan-Arabist Ba'ath Party. The Muslim Brotherhood {{played a major role in}} dissent against the secular Ba'ath Party during the period 1976-1982, and membership in the Brotherhood in Syria became a capital offence in 1980.|$|E
25|$|The {{campaign}} {{was generally not}} well known or understood during the war. The English people {{thought of it as}} a minor operation, a waste of precious resources which would be better spent on the Western Front, while the peoples of India were more interested in the Mesopotamian campaign and the occupation of Baghdad. Australia did not have a war correspondent in the area until Captain Frank Hurley, the first Australian Official Photographer, arrived in August 1917 after visiting the Western Front. Henry Gullett, the first Official War Correspondent, arrived in November 1917. The long-lasting effect of this {{campaign was}} the Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire, when France won the mandate for Syria and Lebanon, while the British Empire won the mandates for Mesopotamia and Palestine. The Republic of Turkey came into existence in 1923 after the Turkish War of Independence ended the Ottoman Empire. The European mandates ended with the formation of the Kingdom of Iraq in 1932, the Lebanese Republic in 1943, the State of Israel in 1948, and the Hashemite Kingdom of Transjordan and <b>Syrian</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>Republic</b> in 1946.|$|E
25|$|In this context, the {{influence}} of Nasserism, Pan-Arab and anti-imperial ideologies created fertile ground {{for the idea of}} closer ties with Egypt. The appeal of Egyptian President Gamal Abdal Nasser's leadership {{in the wake of the}} Suez Crisis created support in Syria for union with Egypt. On 1 February 1958, Syrian President al-Quwatli and Nasser announced the merging of the two states, creating the United Arab Republic. The union was not a success, however. Discontent with Egyptian dominance of the UAR, led elements opposed to the union under Abd al-Karim al-Nahlawi, to seize power on 28 September 1961. Two days later, Syria re-established itself as the <b>Syrian</b> <b>Arab</b> <b>Republic.</b> Frequent coups, military revolts, civil disorders and bloody riots characterized the 1960s. The 8 March 1963 coup, resulted in installation of the National Council of the Revolutionary Command (NCRC), a group of military and civilian officials who assumed control of all executive and legislative authority. The takeover was engineered by members of the Ba'ath Party led by Michel Aflaq and Salah al-Din al-Bitar. The new cabinet was dominated by Ba'ath members; the moderate al-Bitar became premier. He was overthrown early in 1966 by left-wing military dissidents of the party led by General Salah Jadid.|$|E
