40|$|Braking {{resistor}} {{is known}} to be a very powerful tool for transient stability improvement in electric power systems. Usually, in a large power <b>system</b> <b>braking</b> resistors are placed at each generator terminal bus which requires a high installation as well as operation cost. Also, heavy computation is required for the controllers used for the switching of the resistors. From these viewpoints, this paper directs to the study of installation of reduced number of fuzzy logic controlled braking resistors at suitable locations for transient stability enhancement. Groups of coherent generators in the power system are determined. Then one braking resistor is installed in each of the coherent group and at each of the remaining generator terminal bus. Thus, the number of braking resistors is reduced and hence the installation and operation cost as well as computational burden for the controllers are minimized. The suitable location for the braking resistor in each coherent group of generators is determined according to the values of the transient stability index as calculated for a 3 LG (Three-phase-to-ground) fault at the points near the generators of the coherent group without considering the braking resistors in the system.

40|$|The latest {{braking system}} {{architectures}} for Hybrid (HEV) and Full Electric Vehicles (EV) feature {{the adoption of}} the X-by-wire solutions, namely electro-hydraulic (EHB) and electro-mechanical (EMB) braking systems, aimed at providing additional flexibility to the distinctive functions of brake blending and regeneration. Regenerative brakes still need to be supported by conventional friction brakes because of failures occurrence, fully-charged battery conditions, and unexpected variations of the tire-road friction coefficient. In order to achieve a smooth coordinated action between the regenerative and the conventional friction brakes, the brake linings coefficient of friction (BLCF) needs to be monitored. The main contribution of this work lies on the estimation of the BLCF using a tire-model-less approach. In particular, two different observer designs are proposed and compared. Whereas the proposed approach does not rely on any fixed tire modelization, the state estimation is robust against variations in the road friction characteristics and tire uncertainties caused by inflating pressure variations, wear, and aging. The functionality of the developed observers is tested in IPG CarMaker® by employing an experimentally validated EV, equipped with four onboard motors and an EHB <b>system.</b> <b>Braking</b> events are simulated at different deceleration levels on both dry and wet surfaces. Finally, the compensation function against variations in the BLCF is implemented in the EHB controller to achieve constant deceleration levels.

40|$|Tidal {{turbines}} convert {{kinetic energy}} from tidal currents into electricity {{in a similar}} way as wind turbines extract energy from wind. The wind energy industry being more developped, tidal turbine designers use therefore the same methods as their wind turbine counterparts to develop their power plants. The standard engineering method in use is the Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory, which combines the division of the blade in blade elements characterised by their hydrodynamic properties (lift and drag coefficient), their twist angle and their cord length, and the momentum theory, based on the assumptions of actuator disc, irrotational and uniform inflow, among others. However, the differences in the inflow and in the rotor inertia between wind and tidal turbines questions the validity of this method. For instance, contrary to wind turbulence, ocean waves have a frequency close to the rotor frequency, leading to significant variations in the inflow within one rotor revolution. To model loads on tidal turbine blades, one can also call on two other methods, namely model testing and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. These methods are appropriate for design optimisation and/or validation but require respectively expensive test facilities and time consuming simulations on high performance computers. Therefore, these methods are less flexible than the quasi-static BEM method, for which results can be obtained relatively instantaneously for various flow conditions. To get an idea of the accuracy of the BEM method, a two-bladed tidal turbine rotor was designed and tested in a towing tank with a regular wave field and at runaway, i. e. when the rotor is suddenly uncoupled from the grid and rotates freely. These experimental setups were also reproduced in the BEM code, as well as in CFD simulations, using ANSYS CFX. The thrust force and shaft torque obtained by these three approaches could then be compared to point out the need for modeling dynamic effects in the quasi-static BEM method. This was done by analysing the time series in time domain and comparing statistically the mean values, extreme values and standard deviations of the wave tests. A spectral analysis was also used to check if all frequency content appearing in the experimental data was also captured by the BEM, and to what extent. As a result, the mean values of the wave tests match the BEM mean values, as long a there is no stall on the blade under wave troughs. However, the spectral analysis showed that the dynamic (expertimental or CFD) thrust and torque signals may be obtained by high-pass filtering the quasi-static (BEM) values (low-pass filtering the induction factors), observed through a phase delay and an amplification of the peaks at high frequencies. This {{can be explained by the}} dynamic behaviour of the wake. Dynamic wake models developped for wind turbines may be used to correct empirically the BEM codes, with coefficients determined using vortex-based numerical methods. However, vortex codes are not valid for the turbulent wake state, which is often observed passed tidal rotors in waves. Therefore, a correction of the BEM method, as simple as those used for wind turbines, are a priori not adapted for tidal turbines in wave fields. In addition, the actuator disc simplification, necessary in the BEM method, decreases the influence of blade position on rotor loading under regular waves (showing a non-uniform inflow due to the decreasing wave velocity profile with depth). Therefore, the spectral peaks observed at sum frequency (wave+rotor frequency) in the experimental results are attenuated or even not captured by the BEM. As a conclusion, the smaller, but not unsignificant, load cycles at sum frequency are not taken into account in a fatigue analysis based on BEM predictions and would lead to a wrong life time estimation. Concerning the runaway case, the tests highlighted a critical peak in thrust force, rising extremely fast after the release of the rotor. This peak does not appear on the BEM results because it arises from the dynamic properties of the wake. This corroborates with the response of a highpass filter to a step, as previously observed for the wave cyclic loads. The highly loaded rotor makes the wake reach the vortex ring state, whose dynamics cannot be captured with available engineering models. This shows the necessity of an efficient control <b>system</b> <b>braking</b> the rotor in case of runaway. Many questions were raised during this PhD project and further research in this field is necessary to include corrections to the BEM method, so that it takes into account the wake dynamics. Those corrections should be calibrated using CFD simulations and validated by comparing with experimental results...|$|E
40|$|The debouche of Ma'adim Vallis in the Elysium Basin {{generated}} a transitional transported sediment structure, which planimetric shape {{is controlled by}} the enclosing topography of a deep reentrant gulf of the Basin into the highland. We defined it as an estuarine delta. The location and the importance of this estuarine delta is supported by the theoretical model of graded profile constructed for Ma'adim Vallis, and by two approaches: (i) the reconstruction of Ma'adim Vallis downstream course from Gusev to Elysium Basin, and (ii) the survey of the sediment deposit in the alleged estuary. The longitudinal graded profile of Ma'adim Vallis finds its base-level in the Elysium Basin, at a about 1000 m elevation, which is in agreement with the observed Basin shoreline. This model is supported by observational evidence of flow between the northern rim of Gusev crater, and the Elysium Basin shoreline. This downstream course of Ma'adim Vallis can be divided into three hydrogeologic regions. into three hydrogeologic regions. (a) The first region is a flooded plain (Zephiria Mensae), consisting in chaotic terrain formed by highland rocks, and disintegrated lava of the western flank of Apollinaris. Morphologic indicators of the flood process are: (1) the sediment deposit over the Gusev crater northern rim that reflects the overspilling of the crater-lake water through a 40 -km wide gap provided by an ancient impact crater, (2) the tear-drop shaped feature on the northeastern flank of Apollinaris Patera, and (3) the chaotic terrain that suggest the emergence of ground water generated by the seepage of the crater lake through high-permeable broken rampart material. This underground water circulation sustained by the hydrostatic pressure of the crater-lake has likely {{generated a}} hydrothermal system in the volcanic environment of Apollinaris Patera. The stratigraphy of the flooded area is identified as Hesperian age, with occurrences of Noachian hilly individual features, and as Amazonian flooded plain and chaotic material, (b) The second region is located on the western flank of Apollinaris Patera. It is surrounded by relics of deep valleys that suggest a former downstream course of Ma'adim Vallis. The geologic setting of this region (Lucus Planum) is interpreted to be an Amazonian formation composed by the middle and lower members of the Medusae Formation., c) The third region corresponds to the convergence of the west and east branches of Ma'adirn Vallis into a deep re-entrant wide gulf that penetrates about 100 km into the highland. This topographic depression is delineated by the 1000 in elevation contour. This gulf has formed an estuarine configuration centered at 3 S/ 190 W within the Elysium Basin. This configuration has favored the formation of a estuarine sedimentary delta, because of topographically controlled lateral migration. This estuarine structure is strongly dominated by the incoming supply of Ma'adim Vallis fluvial sediment extracted from Zephiria Mensae and Lucus Planum. The obtuse-angle geometry of the estuary increases the sedimentation rate, which is higher than {{in the course of the}} channel. The sediment deposition process is governed by the estuarine water circulation. The inflowing loaded fluvial water enters the estuary as a bottom current, and mixes with the relatively less-loaded water of the receiving basin. When they mixed. the inflowing fluvial material, and the landward basin circulating water generate an accumulation of highly-diversified estuarine deposit stratification. This accumulation of material is mostly centered in the transitional zone of the delta. The sediment trapping efficiency of the estuary is function of the energy balance between the inflowing fluvial water, and the ingoing basin current. The submergence of the delta by the rising of the water-level increases the estuary water-depth, and consequently the sediment entrapment is favored. The locus of sediment accumulation moves landward in the zone of inflowing fluvial water. This results in the rising of the channel base-level, thus in the increase of the length of the longitudinal graded-profile. The sediment deposit facies of the zone A shows a generally smooth surface. The longitudinal deposit is bordered by alluvial terraces that reflect the variations of the channel level. The waning of the Elysium Basin caused the erosion of the Basin estuarine zone by small channels, this episode being characterized by dissected tear-drop shaped mesa-like morphologies in the delta. Our estuarine delta model predicts a lithostratigraphic depositional sequence associated with the water submergence and the transgression of Elysium Basin. The thickness of the estuarine sediment corresponds to the Elysium Basin levels changes relatively to the bed floor of the estuary, The depositional sequence of Ma'adim Vallis are described: (1) a pro-current filled region (A), where fluvial are longitudinally accumulated by the inflowing water, (2) inverse current from Elysium Basin (B), where fluvial and lacustrine sediments are accumulated, and (3) zone of current equilibrium (C), where the sediments are distributed as a shoreline at the boundary of the estuarine delta. The estuary sedimentology dynamics collects and keeps the record of the geologic unit material crossed by Ma'adim Vallis, and those of the lakebed deposit of Elysium Basin. The predicted mixed stratigraphic sequence from fluvial and lacustrine sediment makes this site an exceptional environment to concentrate potential multi-origin biologic records. We envision four possible strategies to explore this sedimentologic record: (1) longitudinal surface and subsurface traverses in region A to investigate outcrop levees, (2) exploration of the mesa walls in region B, (3) deep drilling hole lodging of the sequential deposits in the zones A and B, and (4) surface and subsurface exploration of the shoreline delta. The expected results for each of these strategies are: (1) in the deepest layers of region A are predicted frequent and abundant coarse material, sandy lenses lamination grading downward from sand to cobbles. Volcanic debris from the Noachian crustal Plateau unit material, hydrothermal altered rocks, carbonates, Hesperian and possibly Amazonian volcanic material, from Apollinaris Patera, altered rocks and carbonates from Zephiria Mensae are expected. As a favorable environment for inception of life, possible biological records are expected in transported rock, (2) At the surface, and subsurface (<= 100 m), large deposits sandy to silted material from Elysium paleolake basin mixed with fine-grained sediments from Ma'adim Vallis are expected mostly in the upstream part of region B, (3) on the shoreline of the estuarine delta, abundant fine material from Elysium paleolake basin (evaporites, carbonates), mostly Amazonian in age are expected. The Ma'adini estuary is a favorable landing site for all the above mentioned science aspects, and. for its location. The site lies near the equator, which is favorable for the rover solar power supply, and at 1000 m elevation, which is a favorable configuration for the descent <b>system</b> <b>braking.</b> Another advantage is the extent of the area of high scientific interest (33, 000 sq km), which provides a good ellipse, and potential long study traverses...|$|E
