5|$|In 2008, Conrad {{began dating}} actor Kyle Howard. Howard {{expressed}} concern that appearing on reality television would interfere with his acting career; consequently, their relationship was not documented on The Hills. (After three years together, Conrad and Howard ended their relationship in 2011.) Upon {{the conclusion of the}} fourth season of the series that December, Conrad wished to leave the series to pursue other career opportunities. However, per the producers' requests, she filmed ten episodes for the following season, in which <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> storylines. Conrad made her final appearance on the series in May 2009, attending Montag and Pratt's wedding after much deliberation during the mid-season finale of the fifth season. However, in the July 2009 issue of Cosmopolitan, she stated that producers had pressured her into a reconciliation with Montag throughout the season, adding that she was displeased when they would not allow otherwise. Conrad was replaced by former Laguna Beach castmate Kristin Cavallari until the series' conclusion in July 2010.|$|E
25|$|The 2009 season brought {{significant}} improvements for Hachlaf. She {{set a new}} best time of 2:00.91 for the silver medal at the 2009 Mediterranean Games, although she was somewhat behind Elisa Cusma who set a Games record. She competed at her first global senior competition the following month, the 2009 World Championships in Athletics. Hachlaf recorded the fifth fastest qualifying time in the heats stage, {{but she did not}} manage to finish the semi-finals, dropping out mid-race. <b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> year with an appearance at the 2009 Jeux de la Francophonie, where she won another silver medal, just beaten by her compatriot Seltana Aït Hammou. On {{the final day of the}} competition she took the bronze medal for Morocco in the 4×400m relay.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> final {{appearance}} at the Hungarian National Championships with collecting 9 gold medals. In Atlanta, at the Centennial Olympic Games, although Egerszegi advanced into the final with the best time on 400 individual medley, she finished in third. This was her first and only bronze medal during her Olympic career. She competed in the 4×100 m medley relay as member of the Hungarian team, who finished in 11th. Interestingly, her time in this event at the qualification round, would have won the 100 m backstroke event. Her final career appearance {{was one of the}} finest farewell of all-time in swimming sport: she won her beloved 200 m backstroke event with the greatest margin in any short distance events of the swimming sport, collecting her fifth individual gold medals and defending her titles for three consecutive Olympic Games.|$|E

She also ran in the 100m hurdles at the competition and was seventh in the final.|$|E

2500|$|In the mid-1980s, Summer was {{embroiled in}} a controversy. She {{allegedly}} had made anti-gay remarks regarding the then-relatively new disease, AIDS. Summer, by this time a born-again Christian, was alleged to have said that AIDS was a punishment from God for the immoral lifestyles of homosexuals. Because of this alleged statement, thousands of her records were returned to her record company and she became {{the target of a}} boycott which hurt her career. Some years later, Summer publicly denied that she had ever made any such comment, and {{in a letter to the}} AIDS campaign group ACT UP in 1989 said it was [...] "a terrible misunderstanding." [...] In explaining why she did not respond to ACT UP sooner, Summer stated [...] "I was unknowingly protected by those around me from the bad press and hate letters. If I have caused you pain, forgive me." [...] <b>She</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> letter with Bible quotes (from Chapter 13 of 1 Corinthians).|$|E
2500|$|Case 1. A {{girl had}} 2 {{seizures}} in sleep at 6 years of age. In the first fit {{she was found}} vomiting vigorously, eyes turned to one side, pale, and unresponsive. Her condition remained unchanged for 3 hours before she developed generalized tonic-clonic convulsions. She gradually improved, and {{by the next morning}} was normal. The second seizure occurred 4 months later. She awoke and told her mother that she wanted to vomit, and then vomited. Within minutes her eyes turned to the right. Her mother, who was on her left, asked, [...] "Where am I?" [...] "There, there," [...] the child replied, indicating to the right. Ten minutes later <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> eyes and became unresponsive. Generalized convulsions occurred 1 hour from onset. Thereafter she recovered quickly. Her EEGs showed occipital paroxysms, but this normalized by the age of 10 years. [...] The patient had in childhood infrequent vasovagal syncopes and/or syncope-like epileptic seizures. [...] At last communication with her, she was 29 years of age and following a successful professional career.|$|E

6000|$|MURRAY (concealing his doubt). Yes, {{of course}} you are. Only I'd a darn sight rather see you up and about. We could take a walk, then--through the woods.

60|$|But no bribe could tempt {{her to give}} way, and {{no doubt}} she was well-advised, for she contended that there was {{work to be done}} such as was beyond her years and strength, and that if she sent her ostler off, as well might <b>she</b> <b>close</b> <b>her</b> inn--a thing that was impossible.|$|R
60|$|It {{was of no}} use lecturing her again, for <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> eyes.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> eyes again, {{and went}} on talking incoherently to herself.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him curiously as <b>she</b> <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> gold bag with a snap.|$|E
60|$|His arms quickly <b>closed</b> round <b>her,</b> <b>she</b> {{felt his}} hot breath against her cheek.

60|$|<b>She</b> half <b>closed</b> <b>her</b> {{eyes for}} a moment. When {{she looked at me}} again she was laughing.|$|R

5000|$|Robin Franson Pruter from Forced Viewing {{rated the}} episode with 4/4 {{saying that the}} episode [...] "provides strong {{character}} development as it delves into {{the story of how}} the Salvatore brothers became vampires" [...] and <b>she</b> <b>closes</b> <b>her</b> review: [...] "This episode shows the strengths of the series—strong character development, rich and evolving relationships between those characters, and well-plotted storytelling." ...|$|R
