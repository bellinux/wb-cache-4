5000|$|Daniel P. Aldrich, Associate Professor at Purdue University, {{describes}} three {{mechanisms of}} <b>social</b> <b>capital.</b> Aldrich defines the three differences as bonding, bridging, and linking <b>social</b> <b>capital.</b> Bonding capital are the relationships {{a person has}} with friends and family, making it also the strongest form of <b>social</b> <b>capital.</b> Bridging capital {{is the relationship between}} friends of friends, making its strength secondary to bonding capital. Linking capital is the relationship between a person and a government official or other elected leader. Aldrich also applies the ideas of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> to the fundamental principles of disaster recovery, and discusses factors that either aid or impede recovery, such as extent of damage, population density, quality of government and aid. He primarily examines Japanese recovery following the 2011 Fukishima nuclear meltdown in his book [...] "Building Resilience: <b>Social</b> <b>Capital</b> in <b>Post-Disaster</b> Recovery." ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Researchers {{argue that}} social {{networks}} based on shared values, trust, and norms can facilitate collective action, and such <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> increases {{the ability of}} communities to recover after a disaster, implying {{that the presence of}} <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> ensures collective community action after a disaster and enables recovery. Drawing from comparative case studies of Bhuj and Bachhau, urban centres impacted by the 2001 Gujarat earthquake in India, this study presents a nuanced view of the role of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> during <b>post-disaster</b> recovery. It argues {{that it is important to}} consider community contexts that are inherent to the amount of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> available and the use of resources through social networks. The study demonstrates that strong internal bonds based on mutual trust did not necessarily lead to collective action for post-disaster housing recovery among communities in Bhuj and Bachhau. Moreover, the amount of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> available through bonding networks differed among communities, depending upon their pre-disaster networks and the resources embedded in them. The study findings expand upon the role of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> during disaster recovery; in particular, they contribute to public policy debates on the ability of communities to engage in collective action to meet post-disaster housing needs...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{considers}} {{the role of}} <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> in the <b>post-disaster</b> recovery of fishermen and farmers in a coastal and rural region. Primarily focusing on two towns in Miyagi prefecture which were affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake and the resulting tsunami in 2011, this thesis considers how the possession of cultural and <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> can hinder or enable recovery and company growth. Through the use of three case studies involving local fishermen and farmers who were affected by the disaster, this thesis argues that <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> {{plays an important role}} in enabling the recovery and growth of affected individuals and companies. In addition, not only the possession, but also the characteristics of said <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> determines to what extent and for what purposes <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> can be used to achieve recovery.

Using the 2009 and 2012 floods, we examine how <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> aids in <b>post-disaster</b> recovery among residents in five selected villages in the Ba District of western Viti Levu. It is conventionally believed that moving supplies, aid and expertise into flood-affected areas offers the best path to effective recovery. To test this assumption, data were collected with a questionnaire survey administered to 97 households. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a further 20 respondents.

40|$|Floods {{are among}} the most {{significant}} and frequent hazards to affect communities in the downstream part of the Ba River in Western Viti Levu, Fiji Islands. They often leave in their wake displacements and death putting thousands at risk of sliding into poverty. Using the recent 2009 and 2012 floods, we examine how <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> aids in <b>post-disaster</b> response and recovery among residents in five selected villages in the downstream communities of the Ba River. Data were collected from a questionnaire survey administered to 97 households and semi-structured interviews with a further 20 respondents. It is conventionally believed that moving supplies, aid and expertise into flood-affected areas offers the best path to effective response and recovery. By contrast, our results indicate that residents of downstream communities in Ba District are using four approaches to create and deploy <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> among them to facilitate disaster response. The patterns of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> used for effective response include practices of search and rescue, information, mutual assistance and commercial cooperation. Such strategies help to build resilience at household and community levels and reduce risks of loss of life and costly damage to property. The findings can be used to generate policies concerning the integration of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> as a component of flood disaster response and recovery mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} dissertation {{is comprised}} of three essays that focus on different mechanisms on which <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> influences firm and entrepreneur behavior. All three essays use different econometric techniques to account for endogenous variables. ^ Essay 1 : Are Local Market Relationships Trumping Organic Certification? The Case of Small and Medium Fruit and Vegetable Farmers. This article investigates how an organic fruit and vegetable farmer’s choice to use direct-to-consumer market channels impacts his/her decision to be certified organic. First, we model the decision to be certified organic as a conditionally independent decision from the farmer’s chosen market channels. Second, we estimate the probability of certifying organic as an endogenously determined marketing decision to the choice of market channels, and use a bivariate probit specification to model this decision. Empirical evidence indicates {{that the decision to}} certify is endogenous to the chosen market channels. We show that farmers selling direct to consumers are less likely to certify organic. ^ Essay 2 : The Economic Implications of <b>Social</b> <b>Capital</b> on Hispanic Entrepreneurship. This essay assesses the effect of <b>social</b> <b>capital,</b> defined as the clustering of Hispanics, on the probability of Hispanic business creation. A big issue in xii the <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> literature is identification. We use new econometric procedures to try to address this possible endogeneity and draw causal conclusions on the effect of social interactions on individual economic behavior. This essay provides robust empirical evidence on the role of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> on Hispanic entrepreneurship. We also tackle the constructs of Hispanic heterogeneity and find that second generation Hispanics may be used as a potential indicator for Hispanic entrepreneurial environment. ^ Essay 3 : The Resilience of Small Business: A Post-Katrina Analysis of <b>Social</b> <b>Capital.</b> Small business resilience becomes more relevant as natural disasters become more frequent. Post-disaster business resilience is the product of many complex decisions that result from the interaction of individuals, families, businesses, and communities. Little is known about what it takes for a small business to build resilience after a natural disaster and most studies have focused at a single point in time or look at the community as the unit of analysis. This study enhances the literature by providing empirical evidence on the factors that help small businesses to build post-disaster resilience over time. This article bridges the gap between <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> and <b>post-disaster</b> small business resilience. We answer two main questions. Does <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> explain small business resilience after a natural disaster? And, what type of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> has the greatest impact for building small business resilience? These questions aim to shed light on the relevance of social networks to help small businesses face post-disaster situations. Incentives and interventions should support the creation and strengthening of community linkages through community participation and leadership development. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of new}} {{interactive}} communication tools, particularly social networking sites (SNSs), has grown considerably {{in the last couple}} of decades. According to Boyd and Ellison (2007), SNSs are defined as web-based services that allow individuals to construct a public or semi-public profile, ar-ticulate a list of other users with whom they share a connection, and make visible their social net-works. New Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are changing the way in which we communicate and interact with each other (Hu, Johnston & Hemphill, 2013). These communication tools allow for a switch from one-directional communication (from the issuers to the receivers) to multi-directional communication where everyone can spread and exchange information. In addition, with this new form of communication, networks are no longer related to a specific space and the people who live there - they are now outspread networks (Sutton, 2010). This study examines the role played by ICTs in re-creating places of socialization and maintaining <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> in a <b>post-disaster</b> reconstruction scenario after the disruption of the physical environment that was once important for the creation and maintenance of these relationships. It aims to investigate whether (and how) ICTs can work as communication tools by allowing people that are dislocated post-disaster to maintain contacts with their previous social network and, therefore, to "virtually" restore the broken offline social fabric. First, we will analyze the literature on the role of ICTs, paying particular attention to SNSs for community building and maintenance of <b>social</b> <b>capital.</b> We will then briefly describe how new media have changed the concept of place and social relationships, and why the maintenance of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> is crucial for disaster recovery. Our preliminary task is to introduce the case of L'Aquila before and after the earthquake of 2009, and the methodology and results of our researc...|$|R

30|$|This {{paper offers}} {{exploratory}} research about cross-level construction of collective <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> {{on the basis}} of operations of individual <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> in the context of Chinese society, aiming to contribute to the cross-level dialog between the approaches of individual <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> and collective <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> and to strengthen the discourse construction of the sociology of guanxi. As the extensive applications of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> theory in many disciplines, it seems inevitable that the core conception of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> is explained and used in different research fields. Different research approaches within <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> theory are inclined to keep independent development without dialog. The most serious challenge to the theoretical development of the theory of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> is the conceptual contest between individual approach and collective approach (Payne et al. 2011). Cross-level research on individual <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> and collective <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> has already become a hotly debated topic in the field of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> theory. Meanwhile, the effort of exploring the theoretical pathway about interaction between collective <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> and individual <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> is also helpful to clarifying the operational mechanism of guanxi in the transformation of social structure in contemporary Chinese society. To build the sociology of guanxi with Chinese characteristics, it is important to explore the theoretical pathway of developing collective <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> {{on the basis of}} the operation of individual <b>social</b> <b>capital.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>Social</b> <b>capital</b> is {{considered}} to be crucial for democratic politics. Its benevolent consequences can be attributed to two substantively different modes of <b>social</b> <b>capital.</b> Understood as an individual property the impact of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> will be mainly restricted to those who command these resources. A much less researched approach depicts <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> as a collective good; that is, as a property of distinct societies whose impact everybody will feel. The main question of this study is: How do these individual and collective modes of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> influence democratic citizenship in Western democracies? Multi-level modeling is used to test the impact of the two distinct modes of <b>social</b> <b>capital,</b> as well as their interactions using survey data for 28 democracies extended with indicators for collective <b>social</b> <b>capital.</b> The analyses show that living in a country rich on <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> contributes to democratic citizenship beyond the positive effects of individual <b>social</b> <b>capital.</b> Moreover, especially environments richer on collective <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> activate citizens with high levels of individual <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> are more to be politically active than less equipped environments.

40|$|In this thesis, I explore youth <b>social</b> <b>capital.</b> I am {{interested}} in identifying what youth <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> is, how it is fostered and reproduced and how this may differ from adult forms. I argue that current conceptualisations of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> are inadequate to understand the <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> of young people and that these inadequacies have led some youth <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> theorists to label the <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> of young people as defective or incomplete; with some describing young people as possessing ‘bad’ or ‘dark’ <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> or being <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> deficient. I further maintain that the conceptualisation of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> as existing beyond the processes of class, culture and gender is flawed, as <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> is not fostered and reproduced in isolation, but each of these processes influences the ability of an individual to foster and reproduce <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> by establishing or facilitating the individual’s key life circumstances. Consequently, I propose that {{it is essential to}} approach its measurement holistically. Finally, I argue that due to the differences between youth and adult <b>social</b> <b>capital,</b> the indicators and tools used to measure <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> are inadequate for use on a youth population. In light of this, I suggest the use of 12 indicators of youth <b>social</b> <b>capital,</b> which guide my analysis, and two purposely built generators with which to measure youth <b>social</b> <b>capital.</b> As a result, the main objective {{of this study was to}} find answers to three main questions: what is youth <b>social</b> <b>capital?</b> How do class, culture, and gender affect <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> formation and reproduction? What models and tools can be used to measure youth <b>social</b> <b>capital?</b> In order to do this, I have combined a review on current <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> literature, together with ethnographic research, using data collected from focus groups and more ‘typical’ <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> tools including a survey and two hybrid generators. This thesis, then, makes use of both qualitative and quantitative data in order to explore the stocks of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> held by 50 young people of the Wollondilly Shire, south-west of Sydney. This study concludes that youth <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> does indeed vary from its adult form.

Using the three-factor <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> model proposed by Nahapiet and Ghoshal (1998), antecedents and outcomes of each <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> dimension (structural, relational, and cognitive) were proposed. Specifically, it was hypothesized that aspects of the workplace would influence each dimension of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> through their effect on cross-functional communication frequency. In turn, each <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> dimension would impact team-level outcomes. Initial results indicated that while aspects of the workplace {{had a significant impact on}} communication frequency, communication frequency did not affect <b>social</b> <b>capital.</b> Post-hoc analyses, however, provided empirical evidence that each <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> dimension does have its own unique antecedents.

This research also included the entrepreneurs’ human capital into models and the results suggested that the human capital is not a direct effect to the business performance and it can only take effects after being transformed into personal-mediated corporate <b>social</b> <b>capital,</b> which is internalized as institutionalized <b>social</b> <b>capital.</b> The human capital of entrepreneurs can then be seen as capitals waiting to be invested into the accruing corporate <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> pool.

Two <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> indexes for adolescents (measuring parental <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> and peer-group <b>social</b> <b>capital)</b> were developed for the analysis. The COLINDEX Scale (Chan 1994) was used to measure individualistic and collectivistic values. In all three countries collectivistic values predicted parental <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> whereas individualistic values predicted peer-group <b>social</b> <b>capital.</b> There were also a few country-specific relationships between the constructs, with collectivism and peer-group <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> being positively related in Estonia and individualism and parental <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> signif- icantly negatively correlated in Russia. The current analysis suggests that during the adolescence, collectivistic values {{are more likely to be}} related to higher levels of parental <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> and individualistic values to higher levels of peer-group <b>social</b> <b>capital.</b> Therefore, it seems that at the individual level and for adolescents the individualism and collectivism are related to different forms of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> in the different manner...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> among families living in low income neighborhoods {{has become a}} popular poverty reduction and economic advancement strategy. However conceptual scholarship suggests the broad use of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> has diminished its importance. Scholars have begun to identify the multiple and overlapping characteristics of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> and the field now needs empirical studies to show how specific types of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> are important for families living in low-income neighborhoods. This study tests the relationship between three types of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> (informal bonding <b>social</b> <b>capital,</b> formal bonding <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> and formal bridging <b>social</b> <b>capital)</b> and important outcomes for families in these neighborhoods. Data for the study come from a national neighborhood {{survey conducted by the}} Annie E. Casey Foundation (N= 6, 031). Findings confirm a differentiated relationship between the three types of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> and family outcomes. Study findings suggest that applying a broad understanding of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> to interventions in low-income communities may be inadequate and instead interventions should match a 2 ̆ 2 type 2 ̆ 2 of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> to the community 2 ̆ 7 s presenting issue(s) ...|$|R

Applying Putnam's <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> theory, we examine how <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> in three New York City neighbourhoods affects usage of local branch libraries. A {{survey was conducted}} to understand differences in public library use and <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> in the neighbourhoods.

Hence, {{it may be a}} particularly advantageous resource in developing countries where human and economic capitals are found wanting. This dissertation addresses the paucity of developing country research on this issue by examining the relationship between <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> and children’s nutritional outcomes in India. The literature on <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> identifies three key distinctions: between bridging and bonding social capital; between positive and negative effects of social capital; and the different roles of household and community based <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> that are critical for understanding how <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> operates. Using the India Human Development Survey 2005 - 2006, I operationalize these different forms of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> and test how they impact child nutrition. I find that household-based bridging <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> has a positive association with child nutrition whereas bonding <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> has the opposite impact. Household-based connections with <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> are of greater importance than community (village) -based <b>social</b> <b>capital.</b> Contextual <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> primarily operates as a proxy for local development. Next, I find that bridging <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> improves child nutrition by improving access to modern health care, such as antenatal care, improving uptake of government nutrition supplementation programs, and health knowledge. On the other hand, religious or caste-based <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> reinforces traditional fertility ideals and discourages the use of contraception thereby adversely affecting the health of children. Lastly, I ask if the impact of <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> on child nutrition varies by the level of regional development. I find that <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> acts in the expected ways in developed regions, which have stronger public amenities and higher literacy rates. However, in more deprived areas, bonding <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> has unexpected positive consequences on child nutrition because of how <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> interacts with community resources...|$|R

The present paper follows the convention of distinguishing between trust, bonding, bridging and linking <b>social</b> <b>capital,</b> to conceptualise how religious communities promote and develop <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> within a specifically religious cohort. Developing this construct of religious <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> further, this paper proposes a measure for use specifically among religious communities to assess individual-level <b>social</b> <b>capital.</b> The Williams Religious <b>Social</b> <b>Capital</b> Index (WRSCI) provides a unidimensional construct of religious <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> taking into consideration the four elements highlighted. A sample of 720 members of six cathedral congregations in England and Wales completed a battery of items concerning <b>social</b> <b>capital.</b> Factor analysis procedures produced a 12 -item index of religious <b>social</b> <b>capital.</b> Reliability analyses demonstrated that this index achieved satisfactory levels of internal reliability consistency.

We assume a representative individual maximizes her net benefits from <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> by choosing {{the amount of}} <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> investment in each period of her lifecycle. The model parameters are estimated by fitting the model to observed data using computational techniques. Simulations determine how perturbations to {{individual and}} community characteristics affect individual <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> behavior. The results suggest that <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> investment occurs irrespective of future benefits, personal characteristics affect the level and variance of investment, and institutions matter in determining <b>social</b> <b>capital</b> investment behavior. <b>Social</b> <b>capital</b> <b>Social</b> interaction Social networks...|$|R
