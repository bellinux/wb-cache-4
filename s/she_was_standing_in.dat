25|$|The driver at {{no point}} saw or heard Corrie. She was {{standing}} behind debris which obstructed {{the view of the}} driver and the driver had a very limited field of vision due to the protective cage he was working in.... The driver and his commanders were interrogated extensively {{over a long period of}} time with the use of polygraph tests and video evidence. They had no knowledge that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> the path of the tractor. An autopsy of Corrie's body revealed that the cause of death was from falling debris and not from the tractor physically rolling over her. It was a tragic accident that never should have happened.|$|E

During her {{performance of the}} song on The Circus Starring Britney Spears, the singer performed wearing a military costume, while surrounded by her dancers, some of them riding bicycles. The rendition {{was described as a}} [...] "Rhythm Nation-like military stomp." [...] On 2011's Femme Fatale Tour, Spears wears a golden cape for a snake charming number of the song. Spears included [...] "Boys" [...] on the setlist of her 2013-15 Las Vegas residency, [...] During this performance, she and her dancers wear neon outfits.

The climax of her risqué performance found her [...] "humping" [...] and rolling around on the stage. The song was subsequently performed at The Virgin Tour in 1985. Madonna again donned wedding attire and performed a straight version of the song featuring a quotation from Michael Jackson's similar-sounding Motown-style single, [...] "Billie Jean". Balloons floated out towards the audience as she rolled around the stage, carrying a wedding bouquet in her hand. The performance {{was included in the}} VHS release [...] recorded in Detroit, Michigan. In the 1987 Who's That Girl World Tour, the song was given a lighthearted comedic theme and included quotations from The Four Tops' [...] "I Can't Help Myself (Sugar Pie Honey Bunch)". Madonna took off her outfit piece by piece, until <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> a black corset, and ended the performance while flirting with a young male dancer who played her bridegroom. Two different performances of the song on this tour {{can be found on the}} videos: Who's That Girl: Live in Japan, filmed in Tokyo, Japan, on June 22, 1987, and , filmed in Turin, Italy, on September 4, 1987.|$|E

500|$|The show {{began with}} a skit where a {{flamboyant}} master of ceremonies welcomed spectators to the Onyx Hotel. After this, he took an onyx and threw into the video screens, causing a virtual chandelier {{to fall into the}} floor. Spears briefly appeared in the screens, as her dancers descended to the stage. She entered standing on top of a small bus dressed in a black catsuit, where she performed [...] "Toxic". She descended to the stage for the breakdown and then performed [...] "Overprotected". She took a break to talk to the audience, before going into [...] "Boys", which featured the male dancers pushing her while <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> luggage carts. [...] "Showdown" [...] featured rainbow-colored lighting effects and was the last song of the first act. A video interlude followed featuring Spears and her friends outside a club. While she was leaving, she noticed a woman dressed in 1930s fashion. She followed her and the woman asked Spears to enter the [...] "Mystic Lounge". Spears reappeared wearing a frilly pink corset to perform [...] "...Baby One More Time". She performed [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again" [...] with a vintage microphone and joined by her background singers. Spears and her dancers performed [...] "(You Drive Me) Crazy", which contained elements of Latin percussion. After this, she talked to the audience and usually referenced her wedding with childhood friend Jason Alexander. She also introduced her band before leaving the stage.|$|E
500|$|During [...] "White Heat"—which {{featured}} dialogues {{from the}} 1949 James Cagney {{film of the}} same name—a video screen displayed {{a scene from the}} film, with Cagney saying the dialogue: [...] "A copper... a copper fellas". The video screen moves up and Madonna appears, wearing a lamé jacket and holding a plastic gun in her right hand. A large cut out of Cagney appears in the middle and Madonna finishes singing the song, while pointing the revolver towards her dancers and pretending to fire at them, as sounds of gunshots are heard. She followed it with [...] "Causing a Commotion" [...] which ended with Madonna pointing to her dancers and musicians across stage and uttering the line [...] "He/She's got the moves baby" [...] numerous times. For [...] "The Look of Love" [...] the spotlight was focused on her. The introductory music of the song started and Madonna roamed around the stage, pretending that she was lost. She wanted to portray her Who's That Girl film character Nikki, when she was lost in a similar sequence in the film. After she finished singing the song, Madonna pretended to walk forward by pushing through the air, as the conveyor belt took her backwards, ultimately taking her away from the stage. Then a red phone booth appears on the stage, in which Madonna's silhouette appears to be changing costume. She emerges from the booth wearing the Edna Everage inspired costume and starts singing [...] "Dress You Up". Then she sang [...] "Material Girl", while stretching her legs on stage and showing her underwear and followed by [...] "Like a Virgin", during which she took off her outfit piece by piece, until <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>standing</b> <b>in</b> the same outfit {{from the beginning of the}} show, and ended the performance while flirting with a young male dancer who played her bridegroom.|$|E
