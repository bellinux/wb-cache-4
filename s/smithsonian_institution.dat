5|$|The {{birth of}} the <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution</b> {{can be traced to}} the {{acceptance}} of James Smithson's legacy, willed to the United States in 1826. Smithson died in 1829, and in 1836, President Andrew Jackson informed Congress of the gift, which it accepted. In 1838, Smithson's legacy, which totaled more than $500,000, was delivered to the United States Mint and entered the Treasury. After eight years, in 1846, the <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution</b> was established.|$|E

5|$|Various {{estimates}} {{place the}} tree's seeding sometime between 1354 and 1361 AD. Using borings from the tree, the <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution</b> {{determined that the}} Mingo Oak was the oldest tree of its species. In September 1932, West Virginia state forester D.B. Griffin and Emmett Keadle, president of the Mingo County Fish and Game Protective Association in Williamson, used an increment borer to estimate the tree as having begun its growth around 1356, with {{a margin of error}} within 25 or 30 years. Blueprints and boring samples were given to the West Virginia State Museum in Charleston and to the <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution</b> in Washington, D.C.|$|E

5|$|After the C's {{assets were}} {{acquired}} by the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) in 1871, the PRR refurbished and operated the locomotive a few times for public displays: it was fired up for the Centennial Exposition in 1876 and again for the National Railway Appliance Exhibition in 1883. In 1884 the locomotive was purchased by the <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution</b> as the museum's first major industrial exhibit.|$|E

5|$|The atoll {{consists}} of four islets: Acadia, Pandora, Westward and Edwards. The last three of these can be accessed on foot from Acadia at low tide. The islets were named by Harald Rehder and John Randall, who visited the atoll during an expedition by the <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution</b> in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Virginia's {{culture was}} popularized and spread across America and the South by {{figures such as}} George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Robert E. Lee. Their homes in Virginia {{represent}} the birthplace of America and the South. Modern Virginia culture has many sources, and {{is part of the}} culture of the Southern United States. The <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution</b> divides Virginia into nine cultural regions.|$|E
5|$|After the men {{hauled the}} Flyer back from its fourth flight, a {{powerful}} {{gust of wind}} flipped it over several times, despite the crew's attempt to hold it down. Severely damaged, the airplane never flew again. The brothers shipped it home, and years later Orville restored it, lending it to several U.S. locations for display, then to a British museum (see Smithsonian dispute below), before it was finally installed in 1948 in the <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution</b> in Washington, D.C., its current residence.|$|E
5|$|Conchology is the {{scientific}} study of mollusc shells, but the term conchologist is also sometimes used to describe a collector of shells. Many people pick up shells on the beach or purchase them and display them in their homes. There are many private and public collections of mollusc shells, but the largest one in the world is at the <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution,</b> which houses in excess of 20 million specimens.|$|E
5|$|David Ogden Stiers as Fenton Q. Harcourt, a {{board member}} of the <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution</b> who dismisses Milo's belief in the {{existence}} of Atlantis. Stiers previously worked with Michael J. Fox in Doc Hollywood. He earlier voice-acted for Disney in Beauty and the Beast as Cogsworth, Pocahontas as Governor Ratcliffe, and The Hunchback of Notre Dame as the Archdeacon and would do so again in Lilo & Stitch as Jumba.|$|E
5|$|Eleven of the 19 <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution</b> {{museums and}} {{galleries}} {{are at the}} National Mall in Washington D.C., the open-area national park in Washington, D.C running between the Lincoln Memorial and the United States Capitol, with the Washington Monument providing a division slightly west of the center. Five other Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo are located elsewhere in Washington. Two more Smithsonian museums are located in New York City and one is located in Chantilly, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|Enola Gay {{became the}} center of a {{controversy}} at the <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution</b> when the museum planned to put its fuselage on public display in 1995 as part of an exhibit commemorating the 50th anniversary of the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. The exhibit, The Crossroads: The End of World War II, the Atomic Bomb and the Cold War, was drafted by the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum staff, and arranged around the restored Enola Gay.|$|E
5|$|Falkner Island Light {{was chosen}} for fog-signal {{experiments}} in 1865 and in 1902. In 1865, Joseph Henry of the <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution,</b> the Chairman of the Lighthouse Board, set up bells and whistles and tested the distances they could be heard. In 1879, a steam fog whistle was installed {{at the cost of}} $5000. In 1902, a air siren was installed and powered by two 16½ horsepower engines and used in an experiment in sound penetration. In 1934, a Leslie-Tyfon trumpet was installed.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of the Army's contract, the XR-1 was returned to the company, Platt-LePage believing that the design had potential as a civilian aircraft. The planned civilian version, the PL-9, {{would have been an}} enlarged, twin-engined aircraft; however Platt-LePage was by now in serious financial difficulty following {{the cancellation}} of its Army contract, and in mid 1946 the XR-1's flight test program was concluded, the aircraft being retired to the <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fractional currency, also {{referred}} to as shinplasters, was introduced by the United States federal government following the outbreak of the Civil War. These fractional notes were in use between 21 August 1862 and 15 February 1876, and issued in 3, 5, 10, 15, 25, and 50 cent denominations across five issuing periods. The complete type set below is part of the National Numismatic Collection, housed at the National Museum of American History, part of the <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1935, amateur {{military}} {{marine archaeologist}} Lorenzo Hagglund located her remains standing upright {{at the bottom}} of Lake Champlain, and had her raised. Bequeathed to the <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution</b> in 1961, Philadelphia and associated artifacts are part of the permanent collection of the National Museum of American History, in Washington, D.C., where curator Philip K. Lundeberg was responsible for arranging her initial display. The vessel is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is a National Historic Landmark.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, the <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution</b> {{commissioned}} {{aeronautical engineer}} Paul MacCready {{to build a}} half-scale working model of Quetzalcoatlus northropi. The replica was launched with a ground-based winch. It flew several times in 1986 and was filmed {{as part of the}} Smithsonian's IMAX film On the Wing. However, the model was not anatomically correct and embodied vertical and horizontal tail stabilizers that pterosaurs did not have. It also had a longer tail, changing the weight distribution.|$|E
5|$|In February 2011 the <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution</b> {{announced}} it would be holding an exhibit dedicated {{to the art of}} video games. Several games were chosen initially and the public could vote for which games they felt deserved to be displayed via a poll on the exhibit's website. BioShock was considered a front runner to be displayed because of its status as a game that demonstrated how artistic the medium can be.|$|E
5|$|Koppelman's art {{is noted}} for its originality, masterful technique, humor, and power. He is {{represented}} in most major print collections, including New York's Museum of Modern Art, Guggenheim Museum, Whitney Museum, Metropolitan Museum, New York Public Library, Brooklyn Museum, Philadelphia Museum of Art, National Gallery, <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution,</b> and Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, DC, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.|$|E
5|$|Many of the 53 {{individuals}} were depicted {{on more than}} one note of a series or denomination. In the description of the banknotes, the date in parentheses indicates the individual’s first appearance on a given note type and denomination. When multiple banknotes are listed, the order, though seeming random, is in accordance with the Friedberg Number, in ascending Friedberg order. The engraved portraits are from a virtual exhibit of bank notes which are part of the National Numismatic Collection at the <b>Smithsonian</b> <b>Institution.</b>|$|E
