40|$|Objective This {{study was}} to {{evaluate}} the <b>sunflower</b> <b>cake</b> and enzymatic complex fed to broilers from 22 to 42 d of age. Methods In a completely randomized design, a total of 850 birds were allotted in a 2 × 5 factorial scheme (with and without enzymatic complex) and five inclusion levels (0 %, 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %) of <b>sunflower</b> <b>cake.</b> There were 5 replications and 17 birds in each experimental unit. Data from performance, carcass yield and intestinal morphology were evaluated. Results Feed intake, weight gain, final weight and feed:gain ratio linearly worsened as <b>sunflower</b> <b>cake</b> increased. For weight gain, final weight and feed:gain ratio, the birds whose diets contained levels of 15 % and 20 % of <b>sunflower</b> <b>cake</b> showed worse values (p< 0. 05) than the birds fed the control diet. When fed the enzymatic complex, birds improved (p< 0. 05) crypt depth and villus:crypt ratio in the jejunum. As inclusion levels of <b>sunflower</b> <b>cake</b> increased, villus depth and villus:crypt ratio in duodenum, jejunum and ileum linearly reduced and the crypt depth linearly increased. Carcass yield linearly reduced as <b>sunflower</b> <b>cake</b> increased. Conclusion Based on performance, <b>sunflower</b> <b>cake</b> can be used up to 10 % in broilers feeding from 21 to 42 days of age...|$|E

The experimental design was completely randomized blocks. There were no differences in the nutrient intake of castor bean diets compared with soybean meal. The intake of nutrients in the <b>sunflower</b> <b>cake</b> and sunflower seed diets was decreased compared with soybean meal. The apparent digestibility coefficients of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein, and neutral detergent fiber of <b>sunflower</b> <b>cake</b> and sunflower seed diets were decreased compared with soybean meal. The average daily weight gain of animals fed the castor bean diet (0. 190 kg) was not different from that of the animals fed the soybean meal diet (0. 217 kg). The <b>sunflower</b> <b>cake</b> and sunflower seed diets provided less weight gain (0. 171 and 0. 135 kg d- 1, respectively) than soybean meal due to the lower nutrient intake.

Four isonitrogenous and isoenergetic diets were formulated containing graded levels of either 50 % FM and maize meal (diet 1); 25 % FM mixed with crude <b>sunflower</b> oil <b>cake</b> (SFOC) and bean meal (BM) (diet 2); 12. 5 % FM mixed with <b>sunflower</b> oil <b>cake,</b> BM and ground nut oil cake (GOC) (diet 3) and 0 % FM mixed with de-hulled <b>sunflower</b> oil <b>cake</b> (SFOCD), BM and ground nut oil cake (diet 4). Gonadosomatic index (GSI), sperm quality, plasma sex steroids (11 -keto testosterone [11 -KT]; testosterone [T]; estradiol- 17 beta [E 2]) were evaluated on 10 to 24 fish fed on each diet. Sperm quality was assessed using computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA). Total replacement of fish meal by plant products markedly increased sperm volume, spermatocrit, spermatozoa integrity, and sperm motility. Fish fed diet 3 (12. 5 % fish meal) provided intermediate results on sperm quality whereas the lowest values were obtained in fish fed diets 1 and 2. In fish fed 0 % fish meal (diet 4), androgen levels were higher and estrogen levels were lower than in fish fed fish meal diets. Based on dietary lipid and fatty acid analyses, these results suggest a positive impact of short chain n- 6 fatty acids on androgen synthesis and sperm quality.

Priklausomai nuo ūkininkavimo sąlygų, mikromicetai pašaruose produkuoja toksiškus gyvuliams ir žmonėms junginius – mikotoksinus. Jie neigiamai veikia organizmą – hepatotoksiškai, nefrotoksiškai, imunosupresyviai, estrogeniškai, kancerogeniškai. Tai gali sukelti žmonių ir gyvulių mikotoksikozes (Bakutis, 2004). Vis didesnis dėmesys skiriamas mikotoksinų užterštoms pašarinėms žaliavoms. Sandėliuojant pašarus būtina laikytis sanitarinių higieninių reikalavimų, kadangi pašarinėse žaliavose gausu įvairių maisto medžiagų, yra palanki terpė daugintis daugeliui mikroorganizmų. Dėl visuotinio išplitimo mikotoksinai laikomi vienu svarbiausių žmogaus ir gyvulių sveikatos rizikos veiksnių (Bakutis, 2004). Vienintelis patikimas būdas išvengti pašarinių žaliavų užterštumo mikotoksinais – užkirsti kelią mikromicetams daugintis. Šiam tikslui taikomi skirtingi pašarų užsikrėtimo mikromicetais ir užterštumo mikotoksinais kiekio bei toksiškumo nustatymo metodai. Turi būti taikomos ir kompleksinės profilaktikos priemonės: tinkamos žaliavų sandėliavimo sąlygos, fizikiniai bei cheminiai grūdų apdorojimo būdai (konservantai, detoksikuojamieji preparatai) (Bakutis, 2004). Darbo tikslas: Atlikti, 2005 - 2009 metų laikotarpyje, tirtų LSMU VA Gyvūnų gerovės tyrimų laboratorijoje, atvežtinių pašarinių žaliavų užterštumą mikotoksinais, analizę. Darbo uždaviniai: 1. Atlikti literatūros šaltinių analizę. 2. Įvertinti atvežtinių pašarinių žaliavų užterštumą mikotoksinais (deoksinivalenoliu, zearalenonu, aflatoksinu B 1) 2005 – 2009 metų laikotarpiu. 3. Palyginti skirtingų atvežtinių žaliavų (kukurūzų, sojos rupinių, rapsų išspaudų saulėgrąžų išspaudų,) užterštumą mikotoksinais. 4. Įvertinti atvežtinių pašarinių žaliavų pavojingumą gyvūnams. Aim of study: The {{purpose was}} to analyse feed {{materials}} samples of mycotoxin concentration, which were researched {{in the period of}} 2005 - 2009 in the Animal Welfare Research Laboratory. Main tasks: 1. To analyze literature sources. 2. To assess mycotoxin (deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, aflatoxin B 1) contamination of imported feed materials in the period of 2005 – 2009. 3. To compare mycotoxin contamination of different feed materials (maize, soybean meal, rapeseed cake, <b>sunflower</b> <b>cake).</b> 4. To assess the risk for animals of imported feed materials. Material and methods: - it was selected 72 samples of feed materials i. e. 36 maize samples, 21 soybean meal sample, 6 rapeseed cake samples and 9 <b>sunflower</b> <b>cake</b> samples. - it was analyzed each mycotoxin concentration separately (DON,ZON, AFB 1) in maize, soybean meal, rapeseed cake and <b>sunflower</b> <b>cake.</b> Aflatoxin B 1, zearalenone and deoxynivalenol concentration were assessed with thin-layer chromatography method. Diffusion of mycotoxins in feed materials during 2005 – 2009 was determined using statistical analysis methods. Results and discussion: 1. During the investigation period (2005 - 2009) aflatoxin B 1 concentration varied from 0, 0007 to 0, 005 mg/kg in maize, from 0, 001 to 0, 02 mg/kg in soybean meal, from 0, 001 to 0, 0033 mg/kg in rapeseed cake and from 0, 0013 to 0, 007 mg/kg in <b>sunflower</b> <b>cake.</b> During this period zearalenone concentration varied from 0, 1 to 1, 33 mg/kg in maize, from 0, 17 to 2 mg/kg in soybean meal, from 0, 08 to 1, 2 mg/kg in rapeseed cake and from 0, 05 to 1, 3 mg/kg in <b>sunflower</b> <b>cake.</b> The minimum concentration of deoxynivalenol was 0, 06 mg/kg, the maximum concentration – 3, 5 mg/kg in maize, minimum – 0, 15 mg/kg and maximum – 1, 2 mg/kg in soybean meal, minimum – 0, 125 mg/kg and maximum – 0, 8 mg/kg in rapeseed cake and from 0, 3 mg/kg to 0, 9 mg/kg varied in <b>sunflower</b> <b>cake.</b> 2. During the investigation period mycotoxin concentrations were compared in the feed materials and assessed, that AFB 1 concentration was decreased 46 per cent in maize, and in <b>sunflower</b> <b>cake</b> – 78 per cent. ZON concentration was decreased 36 per cent in maize, 88 per cent – in soybean meal, 14 per cent increased in <b>sunflower</b> <b>cake.</b> DON was decreased 56 per cent in maize, 54 per cent was increased in soybean meal and 51 per cent in <b>sunflower</b> <b>cake.</b> 3. The most contaminated feed materials were maize and <b>sunflower</b> <b>cake.</b> AFB 1 was assessed 0, 02 mg/kg, ZON – 0, 65 mg/kg and DON 1, 15 mg/kg in maize. AFB 1 was 0, 0095 mg/kg, ZON – 1, 1 mg/kg and DON – 0, 5125 mg/kg in <b>sunflower</b> <b>cake.</b> The least contaminated was soybean meal – AFB 1 concentration was 0, 001 mg/kg, ZON – 0, 09 mg/kg and DON – 0, 24 mg/kg. AFB 1 concentration was 95 per cent higher than was in soybean meal, ZON was higher 84 per cent and DON concentration was higher 79 per cent. 4. Assessed mycotoxin concentrations in feed materials don‘t exceed recommended rates, but if these materials will be added to the mixed feed, ZON and DON quantities can be dangerous for the animals health. If we want to protect feed materials from mycotoxin contamination, we have to harvest on time and properly, apply the correct rotation, store in the suitable conditions, use antifungal agents.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to determine the best level of substitution of soybean meal by <b>sunflower</b> <b>cake</b> in diets for kids through the evaluation of quantitative carcass traits. Thirty-two Boer kids X 1 / 2 NDB (no defined breed), males, non-castrated, with 4 months of age and initial body weight of 15 ± 3. 2 kg, were randomly assigned to individual pens. The treatments contained four substitution levels of soybean meal by <b>sunflower</b> <b>cake</b> (0, 33, 66 and 100 % DM). At the end of the experimental period, the animals were slaughtered. There was no influence of the treatments on any of the mean values of the evaluated measures (p> 0. 05) : 21. 78 kg (body weight at slaughter), 8. 65 kg (hot carcass weight), 8. 59 kg (cold carcass weight), 40. 27 % (hot carcass yield), 39. 20 % (cold carcass yield), 7. 73 cm 2 (rib eye area), 46. 74 cm (carcass outer length), 45. 68 cm (carcass internal length), 36. 92 cm (leg length), 26. 04 cm (leg perimeter), 48. 66 cm (hind perimeter), 58. 62 cm (thoracic perimeter), 0. 20 (carcass compactness index), 68. 48 % (total muscle of the leg), 2. 79 % (total leg fat), 55. 19 % (subcutaneous leg fat), 28. 82 % (total bone), 81. 66 g (femur weight), 14. 88 cm (femur length), 0. 38 (leg muscularity index), 2. 53 (muscle:bone ratio) and 33. 42 (muscle:fat ratio).

40|$|AbstractConventional {{alkaline}} extraction from <b>sunflower</b> oil <b>cakes</b> {{leads to}} dark colored protein isolates caused by oxidation of inherent phenolic compounds. Therefore, the extraction at acidic conditions was investigated {{with the aim}} of the simultaneous isolation of sunflower proteins and phenolic compounds by subsequent adsorption from the protein extracts. NaCl concentrations of up to 2 mol/L favored both the protein extraction at pH 6 and the subsequent precipitation while facilitating the adsorptive removal of co-extracted phenolic acids. Overall, light-colored protein isolates with good functional properties were obtained suitable for a broad range of food applications...|$|R

Optimization of various production parameters using response surface methodology (RSM) was performed to assess maximum yield of rifamycin B from Nocardia mediterranei MTCC 14. Plackett-Burman design test was applied to determine the significant effects of various production parameters such as glucose, maltose, ribose, galactose, beef extract, peanutmeal, ammonium chloride, ammonium sulphate, barbital, pH, andmoisture content on production of rifamycin B. Among the eleven variables tested, galactose, ribose, glucose, and pHwere found to have significant effect on rifamycin B production. Optimum levels of the significant variables were decided by using a central composite design. The most appropriate condition for production of rifamycin B {{was found to be}} a single step production at galactose (8 % w/w), ribose (3 % w/w), glucose (9 % w/w), and pH (7. 0). At these optimum production parameters, the maximum yield of rifamycin B obtained experimentally (9. 87 g/kgds dry <b>sunflower</b> oil <b>cake)</b> was found to be very close to its predicted value of 10. 35 g/kgds dry <b>sunflower</b> oil <b>cake.</b> The mathematical model developed was found to fit greatly with the experimental data of rifamycin B production. 1...|$|R
40|$|Aflatoxin, a {{mycotoxin}} found commonly in maize and peanuts worldwide, {{is associated}} with liver cancer, acute toxicosis, and growth impairment in humans and animals. In Tanzania, sunflower seeds {{are a source of}} snacks, cooking oil, and animal feed. These seeds are a potential source of aflatoxin contamination. However, reports on aflatoxin contamination in <b>sunflower</b> seeds and <b>cakes</b> are scarce. The objective of the current study was to determine total aflatoxin concentrations in <b>sunflower</b> seeds and <b>cakes</b> from small-scale oil processors across Tanzania. Samples of sunflower seeds (n = 90) and cakes (n = 92) were collected across two years, and analyzed for total aflatoxin concentrations using a direct competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). For seed samples collected June-August 2014, the highest aflatoxin concentrations were from Dodoma (1. 7 - 280. 6 ng/g), Singida (1. 4 - 261. 8 ng/g), and Babati-Manyara (1. 8 - 162. 0 ng/g). The highest concentrations for cakes were from Mbeya (2. 8 - 97. 7 ng/g), Dodoma (1. 9 - 88. 2 ng/g), and Singida (2. 0 - 34. 3 ng/g). For seed samples collected August-October 2015, the highest concentrations were from Morogoro (2. 8 - 662. 7 ng/g), Singida (1. 6 - 217. 6 ng/g) and Mbeya (1. 4 - 174. 2 ng/g). The highest concentrations for cakes were from Morogoro (2. 7 - 536. 0 ng/g), Dodoma (1. 4 - 598. 4 ng/g) and Singida (3. 2 - 52. 8 ng/g). In summary, humans and animals are potentially at high risk of exposure to aflatoxins through <b>sunflower</b> seeds and <b>cakes</b> from micro-scale millers in Tanzania; and location influences risk...|$|R
40|$|The {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} on growing pigs kept in metabolism crates, either belonging to a “traditional” cross-breed (Duroc x Large White – DLW) or a local breed (Cinta Senese – CS), the digestibility and the nitrogen balance of non-conventional vegetable protein sources (field beans, pea and <b>sunflower</b> <b>cake)</b> when compared to soybean meal. The four diets were formulated so as to supply the same crude protein amount. CS pigs showed lower apparent digestibility coefficients (ADCs) for crude protein (81, 38 % vs 82, 65 %) and crude fibre (35, 97 % vs 40, 65 %). Nitrogen balance was more favourable in DLW pigs (32, 12 % vs 19, 67 %) which showed a higher nitrogen retention (+ 69 %). With respect to the protein source, no differences were observed for nitrogen balance. Sunflower diet showed the higher ADC for ether extract (+ 20 % compared with soybean diet). Crude fibre digestibility was lowered in sunflower (- 33 %) and field beans (- 13 %) diets. Sunflower and field beans diets showed the lowest gross energy digestibility coefficients. Field pea diet had the highest ADC for crude fibre (+ 12 %) leading to ADCs for organic matter and gross energy {{comparable to those of}} soybean meal. It is concluded that field bean, <b>sunflower</b> <b>cake</b> and field pea could be considered as valuable non-conventional protein sources in swine nutrition...|$|E

Fiberboards were cohesive mixtures {{of a natural}} binder and lignocellulosic fibers from <b>sunflower</b> <b>cake.</b> The natural binder ensured the board cohesion, and fibers acted as reinforcing fillers. The influence of molding conditions, i. e. binder type and binder content, on board density, mechanical and heat insulation properties was examined. The medium-density board containing 20 % starch-based binder was a good compromise between mechanical and heat insulation properties (78 mW/m K thermal conductivity).

40|$|The {{standardized}} ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and AA {{was evaluated}} in soybean (Glycine max) meal, sunflower (Helianthus annuus) meal, rapeseed cake, and field pea (Pisum sativum) using 10 pigs and in lupine (Lupinus angustifolius) using 7 pigs. Pigs were fitted {{with either a}} T-cannula or a steered ileocecal valve-cannula. Diets contained 170 to 186 g CP/kg DM. Endogenous losses of CP and AA were estimated by feeding a N-free diet. The SID was calculated using the average of Cr 2 O 3 and TiO 2 as indigestible markers and corrected for type of cannula. The SID of CP was greater (P < 0. 05) for soybean meal and pea compared to <b>sunflower</b> meal, rapeseed <b>cake,</b> and lupine. The SID of Lys and His were lowest (P < 0. 05) in sunflower meal, and the SID of Met and Val were lowest (P < 0. 05) in lupine.
