25|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1924, Serebriakova went to Paris, having {{received}} a commission for a large decorative mural. On finishing this work, she intended {{to return to the}} Soviet Union, where her mother and the four children remained. However, she was not able to return, and although she was able to bring her younger children, Alexandre and Catherine, to Paris in 1926 and 1928 respectively, she could not do the same for her two older children, Evgenyi and Tatiana, and did not <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again</b> for many years.|$|E
25|$|When Cowdrey {{was five}} {{he was taken}} to England and {{attended}} Homefield Preparatory School, Sutton in 1938–45, where the headmaster Charles Walford instilled in him the purity of batting technique that would become Cowdrey's hallmark. Cowdrey made a century in his first game for the school, but a recount made it only 93 and Jack Hobbs sent him a letter of commiseration and a cricket bat. His parents returned to India in 1938 and because of the Second World War he did not <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again</b> until they came back to Britain in 1945. During the holidays he stayed with relatives in Croydon and Bognor Regis, where he watched dog-fights in the Battle of Britain and on his uncle's farm near Market Bosworth.|$|E
25|$|ABC hardly showed any {{baseball}} games {{during the regular}} season in the 1980s and when they did, it was only on either Monday or Thursday nights from the end of Sweeps Week in late May until the NFL preseason started {{in the first week of}} August - and then you wouldn't <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again</b> until the playoffs. ABC also had a clause where they could air a game the last day of the regular season if it had playoff implications, such as in 1987 in regards to the Detroit Tigers' American League East pennant chase against the Toronto Blue Jays. However, in 1986, ABC did do a number of early season Sunday afternoon games before they went into Monday Night Baseball.|$|E

25|$|Luther Standing Bear {{left the}} Pine Ridge Reservation to attend Carlisle. His father celebrated his son's brave act by {{inviting}} {{his friends to}} a gathering and gave away seven horses and all the goods in his dry goods store. Luther became a school recruiter for Captain Pratt and periodically visited reservations. He demonstrated what the students had learned and persuaded parents {{to send their children}} to Carlisle by his appearance, language and skills; however, many children died from infectious diseases in boarding schools and parents were fearful to let them go. Moreover, many parents were treated unfairly and had not been notified until after the children died and were buried. Unscrupulous Indian agents failed to mail letters from Carlisle to the parents, until the parents came into the agency for something. While many parents were proud of Luther, they were afraid to send their children away fearing they would never <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tarski {{applied for}} a chair of {{philosophy}} at Lwów University, but on Bertrand Russell's recommendation it was awarded to Leon Chwistek. In 1930, Tarski visited the University of Vienna, lectured to Karl Menger's colloquium, and met Kurt Gödel. Thanks to a fellowship, {{he was able to}} return to Vienna {{during the first half of}} 1935 to work with Menger's research group. From Vienna he traveled to Paris to present his ideas on truth at the first meeting of the Unity of Science movement, an outgrowth of the Vienna Circle. In 1937, Tarski {{applied for a}} chair at Poznań University but the chair was abolished. Tarski's ties to the Unity of Science movement likely saved his life, because they resulted in his being invited to address the Unity of Science Congress held in September 1939 at Harvard University. Thus he left Poland in August 1939, on the last ship to sail from Poland for the United States before the German and Soviet invasion of Poland and the outbreak of World War II. Tarski left reluctantly, because Leśniewski had died a few months before, creating a vacancy which Tarski hoped to fill. Oblivious to the Nazi threat, he left his wife and children in Warsaw. He did not <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again</b> until 1946. During the war, nearly all his Jewish extended family were murdered at the hands of the German occupying authorities.|$|E
500|$|Bacteria {{were first}} {{observed}} by the Dutch microscopist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1676, using a single-lens microscope {{of his own}} design. He then published his observations {{in a series of}} letters to the Royal Society of London. Bacteria were Leeuwenhoek's most remarkable microscopic discovery. They were just at the limit of what his simple lenses could make out and, {{in one of the most}} striking hiatuses in the history of science, no one else would <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again</b> for over a century.His observations had also included protozoans which he called animalcules, and his findings were looked at again in the light of the more recent findings of [...] cell theory.|$|E

The fair little golden-haired Ariadne shaded her eyes with one arm, and {{stretched}} the other after her Theseus, till the vessel grew smaller, and finally seemed to melt away into the eternal blue. Many be the wives and lovers that have watched those little fishing-craft as they went gayly out like this, but have waited long--too long--and <b>seen</b> <b>them</b> <b>again</b> no more. In night and fog they have gone down under the keel of some ocean packet or Indiaman, and sunk with brave hearts and hands, like a bubble in the mighty waters. Yet Mrs. Pennel did not turn back to her house in apprehension of this. Her husband had made so many voyages, and always returned safely, that she confidently expected before long to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> home <b>again.</b>|$|R

500|$|Sellers's {{behaviour}} {{towards his}} family worsened in 1962; {{according to his}} son Michael, Sellers asked him and his sister Sarah [...] "who we love more, our mother or him. Sarah, to keep the peace, said, 'I love you both equally'. I said, 'No, I love my mum.'" [...] This prompted Sellers to throw both children out, saying that {{he never wanted to}} <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again.</b> At the end of 1962, his marriage to Anne broke down. In 1963, Sellers starred as gang leader [...] "Pearly Gates" [...] in Cliff Owen's The Wrong Arm of the Law, followed by his portrayal of a vicar in Heavens Above! ...|$|E
500|$|Inmates {{were free}} to leave {{whenever}} they wished after giving reasonable notice, {{generally considered to be}} three hours, but if a parent discharged him or herself then the children were also discharged, to prevent them from being abandoned. [...] The comic actor Charlie Chaplin, who spent some time with his mother in Lambeth workhouse, records in his autobiography that when he and his half-brother returned to the workhouse after having been sent to a school in Hanwell, he was met at the gate by his mother Hannah, dressed in her own clothes. Desperate to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again</b> she had discharged herself and the children; they spent the day together playing in Kennington Park and visiting a coffee shop, after which she readmitted them all to the workhouse.|$|E
500|$|Captain James Hingston Tuckey {{visited in}} 1816. He {{said that the}} local people thought the falls were the {{residence}} of an evil spirit, and that anyone who saw them would never <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again.</b> Visiting in the dry season, he was disappointed by the falls. He described the site as comprising a large hill of syenite, a course-grained igneous rock, on the south side. The northern side, made of the same material, was not as high, but steeper than the south. He described the river as having forced its course and within {{the middle of the}} river an island of slate [...] "still defies its power, and breaks the current into two narrow channels; that near the south side gives vent to a great mass of water, over which the torrent rushes with great fury and noise, as may easily be conceived".|$|E

500|$|On 29 November 1827 Donald, a lodger in Hare's house, died of dropsy {{shortly before}} {{receiving}} a quarterly army pension while owing £4 of back rent. After Hare bemoaned his financial loss to Burke, the pair {{decided to sell}} Donald's body {{to one of the}} local anatomists. A carpenter provided a coffin for a burial which was to be paid for by the local parish. After he left, the pair opened the coffin, removed the body—which they hid under the bed—filled the coffin with bark from a local tanners and resealed it. After dark, on the day the coffin was removed for burial, they took the corpse to Edinburgh University, where they looked for a purchaser. According to Burke's later testimony, they asked for directions to Professor Monro, but a student sent them to Knox's premises in Surgeon's Square. Although the men dealt with juniors when discussing the possibility of selling the body, it was Knox who arrived to fix the price at £7 10s. Hare received £4 5s while Burke took the balance of £3 5s; Hare's larger share was to cover his loss from Donald's unpaid rent. According to Burke's official confession, as he and Hare left the university, one of Knox's assistants told them that the anatomists [...] "would be glad to <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again</b> when they had another to dispose of".|$|E

Crucially, Mark originally had no post-resurrection appearances of Jesus, although Mark 16:7, in which the young man discovered in the tomb instructs the women to tell [...] "the disciples and Peter" [...] that Jesus will <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again</b> in Galilee, hints that the author may have known of the tradition.|$|E

2500|$|Following the pre-{{audition}}s, acts audition {{in front}} of (as of 2016) four celebrity judges. The judges may end an act's performance early by pressing their red buzzer, which lights up their corresponding X above the stage. If an act receives X's from all judges, they must stop their performance. In addition, large audiences have also been {{a factor in the}} judging process, as their reaction to an act's performance may swing or influence a judge's vote. This makes the audience the so-called [...] "fifth" [...] ("fourth", from seasons 1-4) judge. From seasons 1 to 4, voting worked on a majority-of-two basis where two positive votes were required. Starting from season 5, voting works on a majority-of-three basis as there are four judges.

2500|$|One major {{difference}} from battles in other theatres {{of the war}} was the burden of the wounded on their unit. They could not be left for the enemy to care for, as had been the case in Syria. Years later Potts recalled [...] "We had to sit in the jungle listening to the screams of comrades tortured by the Japanese in an attempt to provoke an attack". Papuan bearers were not used in battle zones, so the wounded had to be carried by their comrades, slowing them down. 2/14th and 2/16th left their wounded to be carried by 2/27th, the last battalion to withdraw. 120 men at a time were engaged carrying stretcher cases. Many severely wounded men walked to free a stretcher for someone worse off than themselves. The Japanese pursued the 2/27th, but an audacious counterattack by 'B' and 'D' Companies bought the Australian rearguard some time. The adjutant of the 2/27th, Captain Harry Katekar, was quoted as saying, [...] "The Japs were so shocked they broke contact. We didn't <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again</b> that day".|$|E
2500|$|On January 1, 1891, Martí's essay [...] "Nuestra America" [...] was {{published}} in New York's Revista Ilustrada, and on the 30th of that month in Mexico's El Partido Liberal. He actively participated in the Conferencia Monetaria Internacional (The International Monetary Conference) in New York during that time as well. On June 30 {{his wife and son}} arrived in New York. After a short time, in which Carmen Zayas Bazán realized that Martí's dedication to Cuban independence surpassed that of supporting his family, she returned to Havana with her son on August 27. Martí would never <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again.</b> The fact that his wife never shared the convictions central to his life was an enormous personal tragedy for Martí. He turned for solace to Carmen Miyares de Mantilla, a Venezuelan who ran a boarding house in New York, and he is presumed to be the father of her daughter María Mantilla, who was in turn the mother of the actor Cesar Romero, who proudly claimed to be Martí's grandson. In September Martí became sick again. He intervened in the commemorative acts of The Independents, causing the Spanish consul in New York to complain to the Argentine and Uruguayan governments. Consequently, Martí resigned from the Argentinean, Paraguayan, and Uruguayan consulates. In October he published his book Versos Sencillos.|$|E

2500|$|Luther was {{a school}} {{recruiter}} for Captain Richard Henry Pratt and periodically visited reservations. He was sincere in his desire to show what we had learned, and persuaded parents {{to send their children}} to Carlisle by his appearance, language and skills. [...] However, many children died in boarding schools and parents were fearful to let them go. [...] Moreover, many parents were treated unfairly and had not been notified until after the children died and were buried. It was not the negligence of Captain Pratt, but rather lax Indian agents who would set aside letters from Carlisle until the parents came into the agency for something. While many parents were proud of Luther, they were afraid to send their children away fearing they would never <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again.</b> Luther got mixed reception home on the reservation. Some were proud of his achievements while others lamented that he had, in effect, become a white man. He was happy to be home and some of his relatives aid that he “looked like a white boy dressed in eastern clothes.” Luther felt proud to be compared to a white boy. But others would not shake his hand because some returning Carlisle students were ashamed of their culture, and a few even tried to pretend that they did not speak Lakota. The difficulties of returning Carlisle students disturbed white educators. Returning Carlisle students found themselves stranded between two cultures, and not accepted by either. Some rejected their educational experiences and “returned to the blanket”, casting off white ways. Others found it more convenient and satisfying to remain in white society. Most were able to adjust at least partially to both worlds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{final section}} opens with {{discussion}} of a plan developed for Dmitri's escape from his sentence of twenty years of hard labor in Siberia. The plan is never fully described, {{but it seems to}} involve Ivan and Katerina bribing some guards. Alyosha approves, first, because Dmitri is not emotionally ready to submit to such a harsh sentence, secondly, because he is innocent, and, third, because no guards or officers would suffer for aiding the escape. Dmitri and Grushenka plan to escape to America and work the land there for several years, and then to return to Russia under assumed American names, because they both cannot imagine living without Russia. Dmitri begs for Katerina to visit him in the hospital, where he is recovering from an illness before he is due to be taken away. When she does, Dmitri apologizes for having hurt her; she in turn apologizes for bringing up the implicating letter during the trial. They agree to love each other for that one moment, and say they will love each other forever, even though both now love other people. The novel concludes at Ilyusha's funeral, where Ilyusha's schoolboy friends listen to Alyosha's [...] "Speech by the Stone". Alyosha promises to remember Kolya, Ilyusha, and all the boys and keep them close in his heart, even though he will have to leave them and may not <b>see</b> <b>them</b> <b>again</b> until many years have passed. He implores them to love each other and to always remember Ilyusha, and to keep his memory alive in their hearts, and to remember this moment at the stone when they were all together and they all loved each other. Alyosha then recounts the Christian promise that they will all be united one day after the Resurrection. In tears, the twelve boys promise Alyosha that they will keep each other in their memories forever, join hands, and return to the Snegiryov household for the funeral dinner, chanting, [...] "Hurrah for Karamazov!" ...|$|E
