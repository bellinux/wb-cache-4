40|$|INTRODUCTION: Whether high factor (F) VIII and low free protein <b>S</b> <b>levels</b> are {{risk factors}} for {{arterial}} thrombosis is unclarified. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a post-hoc analysis of a single-centre retrospective family cohort, we determined if these two proteins could {{increase the risk of}} arterial thrombosis. In total, 1399 relatives were analysed. RESULTS: Annual incidence in relatives with high FVIII levels was 0. 29 % (95 %CI, 0. 22 - 0. 38) compared to 0. 13 % (95 %CI, 0. 09 - 0. 19) in relatives with normal FVIII levels. In relatives with low free protein <b>S</b> <b>levels,</b> this risk was 0. 26 % (95 %CI, 0. 16 - 0. 40), compared to 0. 14 % (95 %CI, 0. 10 - 0. 20) in relatives with normal free protein <b>S</b> <b>levels.</b> Mean FVIII levels adjusted for age and sex were 11 IU/dL, 18 IU/dL, and 21 IU/dL higher in relatives with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity as compared to relatives without these arterial thrombotic risk factors. Moreover, a dose response relation between increasing FVIII and body mass index was found. None of these associations were shown for free protein S. CONCLUSIONS: High FVIII and low free protein <b>S</b> <b>levels</b> seemed to be mild {{risk factors for}} arterial thrombosis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Increased {{circulating}} cathepsin <b>S</b> <b>levels</b> {{have been}} linked to increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases and cancer. However, whether cathepsin S is a modifiable risk factor is unclear. We aimed to investigate the effects of a prudent diet on plasma cathepsin <b>S</b> <b>levels</b> in healthy individuals. FINDINGS: Explorative analyses of a randomized study were performed in 88 normal to slightly overweight and hyperlipidemic men and women (aged 25 to 65) that were randomly assigned to ad libitum prudent diet, i. e. healthy Nordic diet (ND) or a control group (habitual Western diet) for 6  weeks. Whereas all foods in the ND were provided, the control group was advised to consume their habitual diet throughout the study. The ND was in line with dietary recommendations, e. g. low in saturated fats, sugars and salt, but high in plant-based foods rich in fibre and unsaturated fats. The ND significantly decreased cathepsin <b>S</b> <b>levels</b> (from 20. 1 (+/- 4. 0 SD) to 19. 7  μg/L (+/- 4. 3 SD)) compared with control group (from 18. 2 (+/- 2. 9 SD) to 19. 1  μg/L (+/- 3. 8 SD)). This difference remained after adjusting for sex and change in insulin sensitivity (P[*]=[*] 0. 03), and near significant after adjusting for baseline cathepsin <b>S</b> <b>levels</b> (P[*]=[*] 0. 06), but not for change in weight or LDL-C. Changes in cathepsin <b>S</b> <b>levels</b> were directly correlated with change in LDL-C. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with a habitual control diet, a provided ad libitum healthy Nordic diet decreased cathepsin <b>S</b> <b>levels</b> in healthy individuals, possibly mediated by weight loss or lowered LDL-C. These differences between groups in cathepsin S were however not robust and therefore need further investigation...|$|R

40|$|BackgroundAdult {{body mass}} index (BMI) has been {{associated}} with urinary melatonin levels in humans; however, whether earlier-life body size is associated with melatonin, particularly among night shift workers, remains unknown. MethodsWe evaluated associations of birth weight, body shape (or somatotype) at ages 5 and 10, BMI at age 18 and adulthood, weight change since age 18, waist circumference, waist to hip ratio, and height with creatinine-adjusted morning urinary melatonin (6 -sulfatoxymelatonin, aMT 6 <b>s)</b> <b>levels</b> among 1, 343 healthy women (aged 3222 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 53 at urine collection, 199622 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 01 c 1999) in the Nurses 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 Health Study (NHS) II cohort. Using multivariable linear regression, we computed least-square mean aMT 6 <b>s</b> <b>levels</b> across categories of body size, and evaluated whether these associations were modified by night shift work. ResultsAdult BMI was inversely associated with aMT 6 <b>s</b> <b>levels</b> (mean aMT 6 <b>s</b> <b>levels</b> 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 030 = 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 03034 vs. 5020 ng/mg creatinine, comparing adult BMI 22 ̆ 030530 vs. < 2020 kg/m 2; Ptrend < 0. 0001); however, other measures of body size were not related to aMT 6 <b>s</b> <b>levels</b> after accounting for adult BMI. Night shifts worked prior to urine collection, whether recent or cumulatively over time, did not modify the association between adult BMI and aMT 6 <b>s</b> <b>levels</b> (e. g., Pinteraction 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 030 = 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 0300. 72 for night shifts worked within two weeks of urine collection). ConclusionsOur results suggest that adult BMI, but not earlier measures of body size, is associated with urinary aMT 6 <b>s</b> <b>levels</b> in adulthood. These observations did not vary by night shift work status, and suggest that adult BMI may be an important mechanism by which melatonin levels are altered and subsequently influence chronic disease risk.

40|$|Background—Heat shock protein (HSP) 27 {{is related}} to the {{pathogenesis}} of AF. However, the clinical relationship between HSP 27 and AF is unclear. The present study was conducted to determine the clinical relationship between HSP 27 and atrial fibrillation (AF). Methods and Results—A case-control study was conducted (AF, n 114; control, n 100). Serum HSP 27 (HSP 27 <b>S)</b> <b>levels</b> were measured by ELISA, and its correlations with electrophysiological characteristics and catheter ablation outcomes were investigated. The patients with AF had a larger left atrial diameter (LAD), waist circumference, and body mass index, and a lower baseline HSP 27 <b>S</b> <b>level,</b> than controls. After logistic multivariate analysis, low baseline HSP 27 S was independently associated with AF. In patients with AF, those with paroxysmal AF (PAF) had higher baseline HSP 27 <b>S</b> <b>levels</b> compared with those without PAF. In patients with PAF, lower baseline HSP 27 S was associated with larger LAD, whereas baseline HSP 27 S was not correlated with LAD in controls. In PAF, low baseline HSP 27 S (3. 85 ng/mL) was associated with low atrial voltage and nonpulmonary vein ectopies. In non-PAF, the mean fractionated interval had a good correlation with baseline HSP 27 S. After catheter ablation, a high baseline HSP 27 <b>S</b> <b>level</b> could predict sinus rhythm maintenance in the patients with PAF.
