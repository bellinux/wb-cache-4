40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} origins of children's {{understanding}} of multiplication and division and how they progressively become coordinated in young children. The {{hypothesis of the study}} is that {{the origins of}} these operations are in children's schemas of action. This leads to the prediction that children can understand about multiplicative relations before they can solve computational multiplicative problems. This hypothesis is contrasted with Fischbein's et al. (1985) hypothesis that multiplication originates from repeated addition and quotitive division from repeated subtraction, which leads to the prediction that children must be able to quantify in order to understand multiplicative relations. To test these predictions a series of studies was carried out analysing children's performance in relational, non computational problems and in computational problems, involving discontinuous and continuous quantities which could not be quantified. The first study explored children's use of one-to-many correspondence reasoning to solve a variety of problems. Children aged 4 to 7 were asked: a) to order different sets on the basis of correspondence relations; and b) to indicate the size of the corresponding sets. Even the 5 year olds were able to order the size of the sets when they could use correspondence relations. The same children had great difficulty in indicating the size of the sets. This demonstrated that the ability to quantify is not a prerequisite for understanding multiplicative relations. The second and third studies explored children's understanding of the inverse relation between the number of the quotas and their size in sharing problems. The children (aged 4 to 7) were tested in partition and quotition problems. In partitive problems {{more than half of the}} 6 year olds and the majority of the 7 year olds showed an understanding of the inverse divisor-quotient relation. In the quotitive problems, although there was a drop in the level of performance, it was not found to be significant across the same age groups. Children's's ability to reflect on the relations involved in a sharing situation before being able to quantify the problems challenges the hypothesis that quantification is the origin for understanding division. The fourth study explored whether multiplication and division develop as independent or coordinated operations. Children were asked to quantify a set of multiplication and division problems in which it was possible to model the problem directly using their schemas of action and a second set where this direct modelling was not possible because a crucial piece of information was missing. It was expected that children who have coordinated their multiplicative schemas of action would be able to deploy an action usually associated with division to <b>solve</b> <b>a</b> <b>multiplication</b> <b>problem</b> and vice versa. More than half of the children were able to quantify the problems that matched their actions directly, but their performance decreased in the missing value multiplication problems that were solved by an action related to division. The discrepancy in the children's performance suggests that the two operations have different roots and initially develop independently of each other. The findings support the hypothesis that the understanding of multiplication and division is constructed from children's schemas of action. The two operations have distinct roots and develop independently before they become coordinated at a later stage...|$|E
30|$|The {{transition}} from purely additive reasoning to multiplicative thinking and, ultimately, proportional reasoning {{is a key}} transition {{students are expected to}} make in middle-grade mathematics (see Lamon, 2007, 2012, for thorough discussions of these transitions).

This paper {{focuses on}} a class of problem {{relating}} to the <b>multiplication</b> of <b>a</b> single number by several coefficients that, while not constant, are drawn from a finite set of constants that change with time.

40|$|Recently, using a {{training}} paradigm, Campbell and Agnew (2009) observed cross-operation response time savings with nonidentical elements (e. g., practice 3 + 2, test 5 - 2) for addition and subtraction, showing {{that a single}} memory representation underlies addition and subtraction performance. Evidence for cross-operation savings between multiplication and division have been described frequently (e. g., Campbell, Fuchs-Lacelle & Phenix, 2006) but {{they have always been}} attributed to a mediation strategy (reformulating a division <b>problem</b> as <b>a</b> <b>multiplication</b> <b>problem,</b> e. g., Campbell et al., 2006). Campbell and Agnew (2009) therefore concluded that there exists a fundamental difference between addition and subtraction {{on the one hand and}} multiplication and division on the other hand. However, our results suggest that retrieval savings between inverse <b>multiplication</b> and division <b>problems</b> can be observed. Even for small problems (solved by direct retrieval) practicing a division problem facilitated the corresponding <b>multiplication</b> <b>problem</b> and vice versa.

40|$|Multiplication and {{division}} are conceptually inversely related: Each division {{problem can be}} transformed into as <b>a</b> <b>multiplication</b> <b>problem</b> and vice versa. Recent research has indicated strong developmental parallels between multiplication {{and division}} in primary school children. In this study, {{we were interested in}} (i) whether these developmental parallels persist into secondary school, (ii) whether similar developmental parallels can be observed for simple and complex problems, (iii) whether skill level modulates this relationship, and (iv) whether the correlations are specific and not driven by general cognitive or arithmetic abilities. Therefore, we assessed performance of 5 th and 6 th graders attending two secondary school types of the German educational system in simple and complex multiplication as well as division while controlling for non-verbal intelligence, short-term memory, and other arithmetic abilities. Accordingly, we collected data from students differing in skills levels due to either age (5 th < 6 th grade) or school type (general < intermediate secondary school). We observed moderate to strong bivariate and partial correlations between multiplication and division with correlations being higher for simple tasks but nevertheless reliable for complex tasks.

30|$|As {{documented}} by Steffe (1992), even INS students can solve, {{what is to}} the observer, <b>a</b> <b>multiplication</b> <b>problem.</b> Certainly, TNS students can solve <b>multiplication</b> <b>problems,</b> and this corresponds to what Hackenberg and colleagues (e.g., Hackenberg & Lee, 2015; Hackenberg & Tillema, 2009) have popularized as the first multiplicative concept (see also Steffe, 1992). However, as Steffe (1992) explains, students with the first multiplicative concept cannot reinterpret the situation {{in terms of the}} results of their multiplicative unit coordination. That is to say, a student may determine the numerosity of “eight times seven” by counting by seven eight times and yet not be aware of the result, 56, as being in a multiplicative relationship with 7. The awareness of a multiplicative relationship does not start to emerge until the iterable unit of 1 that characterizes an ENS is constructed (e.g., Hackenberg & Lee, 2015; Ulrich, 2016 a), and it is restricted to a multiplicative relationship between 1 and composite units at the ENS stage. Because this awareness of a multiplicative relationship is required for the type of multiplicative thinking outlined by Lamon (2012) in which students must be aware of not just the relationship but the intensive quantity representing that relationship (eight times as big as in this example), TNS students’ lack of awareness of multiplicative relationships bodes poorly for their ability to make a smooth transition to multiplicative thinking and proportional reasoning.|$|R

The $k$-NNG algorithm has many applications {{in areas such as}} machine learning, bio-informatics, and clustering analysis.

There are two main parts to the algorithm: the first part is finding the distances between the input vectors which may be formulated as <b>a</b> matrix <b>multiplication</b> <b>problem.</b> The second is the selection of the $k$-NNs for each of the query vectors.

The results show that, contrary to common belief, the binary representation clearly yields better solutions than CSD, and even provides slightly better solutions than MSD.

The proposed strategy, named as polynomial codes, achieves the optimum recovery threshold, defined as the minimum number of workers that the master needs to wait for in order to compute the output. Furthermore, by leveraging the algebraic structure of polynomial codes, we can map the reconstruction problem of the final output to a polynomial interpolation problem, which can be solved efficiently. Polynomial codes provide order-wise improvement over {{the state of the}} art in terms of recovery threshold, and are also optimal in terms of several other metrics.

50|$|A third {{component}} of the embodied approach looks at how agents use their immediate environment in cognitive processing. Meaning, the local environment {{is seen as an}} actual extension of the body's cognitive process. The example of a personal digital assistant (PDA) is used to better imagine this. Echoing functionalism (philosophy of mind), this point claims that mental states are individuated by their role in a much larger system. So under this premise, the information on a PDA is similar to the information stored in the brain. So then if one thinks information in the brain constitutes mental states, then it must follow that information in the PDA is a cognitive state too. Consider also the role of pen and paper in <b>a</b> complex <b>multiplication</b> <b>problem.</b> The pen and paper are so involved in the cognitive process of solving the problem that it seems ridiculous to say they are somehow different from the process, in very much the same way the PDA is used for information like the brain. Another example examines how humans control and manipulate their environment so that cognitive tasks can be better performed. Leaving one's car keys in a familiar place so they aren't missed for instance, or using landmarks to navigate in an unfamiliar city. Thus, humans incorporate aspects of their environment to aid in their cognitive functioning.|$|R

Evidence of model use, type of models generated, and how the models and the corresponding strategies were used to solve <b>multiplication</b> <b>problems</b> were assessed. The main focus was to discover the models and strategies that learners were using prior to the intervention lessons (assessed using a pre-test), to identify the shifts with respect to these models and strategies {{during the course of the}} intervention lessons and finally to identify the kind of models and strategies that learners were using by the end of the small scale intervention (assessed with a post-test which was a repear sitting of the pre-test). Results indicated that learners were using a limited number of models and strategies at the beginning. As a result of the intervention lessons, learners began to use a broader range of models within their problem-solving.
