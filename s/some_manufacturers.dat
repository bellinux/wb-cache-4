5|$|As {{with most}} {{sympathomimetic}} stimulants {{there appear to}} be significant side effects associated with BZP use. BZP reportedly produces insomnia and a mild to severe hangover after the drug effect wears off, however, <b>some</b> <b>manufacturers</b> in New Zealand have started including recovery pills which contain 5-HTP and vitamins which allegedly ease these hangovers.|$|E
5|$|Bulker hulls {{are made}} of steel, usually mild steel. <b>Some</b> <b>manufacturers</b> have {{preferred}} high-tensile steel recently {{in order to reduce}} the tare weight. However, the use of high-tensile steel for longitudinal and transverse reinforcements can reduce the hull's rigidity and resistance to corrosion. Forged steel is used for some ship parts, such as the propeller shaft support. Transverse partitions {{are made of}} corrugated iron, reinforced at the bottom and at connections. The construction of bulker hulls using a concrete-steel sandwich has been investigated.|$|E

50|$|OpenVPN {{has been}} {{implemented}} in <b>some</b> <b>manufacturer</b> router firmware, {{such as the}} D-Link DSR-250 and some MikroTik Routers. MikroTik's implementation {{does not support the}} UDP protocol or LZO compression, which limits transfer speeds attainable. MikroTik said in 2010 that they would not continue developing OpenVPN in favor of SSTP.|$|R

5|$|Manufacturers of {{personal}} electronic devices might {{not include a}} USB standard connector on their product for technical or marketing reasons. <b>Some</b> <b>manufacturers</b> provide proprietary cables that permit their devices to physically connect to a USB standard port. Full functionality of proprietary ports and cables with USB standard ports is not assured; for example, some devices only use the USB connection for battery charging and do not implement any data transfer functions.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, <b>some</b> <b>manufacturers</b> (notably Samsung) {{introduced}} SSD controllers {{that extended}} {{the concept of}} BGC to analyze the file system used on the SSD, to identify recently deleted files and unpartitioned space. Samsung claimed that this would ensure that even systems (operating systems and SATA controller hardware) which do not support TRIM could achieve similar performance. The operation of the Samsung implementation appeared to assume and require an NTFS file system. It is not clear if this feature is still available in currently shipping SSDs from these manufacturers. Systematic data corruption has been reported on these drives {{if they are not}} formatted properly using MBR and NTFS.|$|E
5|$|While {{technical}} {{improvements and}} an equal-tempered scale reduced {{the need for}} two clarinets, the technical difficulty of playing in remote keys persisted, and the A has thus remained a standard orchestral instrument. In addition, by the late 19th century, the orchestral clarinet repertoire contained so much music for clarinet in A that the disuse of this instrument was not practical. Attempts were made to standardise to the B instrument between 1930 and 1950 (e.g., tutors recommended learning routine transposition of orchestral A parts on the B clarinet, including solos written for A clarinet, and <b>some</b> <b>manufacturers</b> provided a low E on the B to match {{the range of the}} A), but this failed in the orchestral sphere.|$|E

5|$|Atherton, {{along with}} {{neighbouring}} Shakerley, {{was associated with}} coal mining and nail manufacture. Alexander Naylor was taxed on his goods in 1332, showing the industry was present for at least 600years. Encouraged by the proximity of outcrops of coal, iron was brought from Derbyshire, Yorkshire and Spain. A variety of nails were made, lath nails, slate nails, thatching nails and sparrowbills. The nail smithies manufactured ploughs and scythes; their products were taken by pack horse to be sold in Manchester, Denbigh, Clitheroe and Kendal. The nail industry developed into the manufacture of nuts and bolts. Thomas Blakemore {{was the first in}} 1843 and by 1853 there were eight makers of nuts and bolts including James Prestwich and Robert Parker. <b>Some</b> <b>manufacturers</b> of nuts and bolts made spindles and flyers for spinning machinery. Collier Brook Bolt Works on Bag Lane dating from 1856 survives and is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, most {{applications}} {{that do not}} depend on thorium's radioactivity declined quickly due to safety and environmental concerns as suitable safer replacements were found. Despite its radioactivity, the element has remained in use for applications where no suitable alternatives could be found. A 1981 study by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the United States estimated that using a thorium mantle every weekend would be safe for a person, {{but this was not}} the case for the dose received by people manufacturing the mantles (and thus contacting many) or for the soils around some factory sites. <b>Some</b> <b>manufacturers</b> have changed to other materials, such as yttrium, although these are usually either more expensive or less efficient. Other manufacturers continued to make thorium mantles, but moved their factories to developing countries. As recently as 2007, some companies continued to manufacture and sell thorium mantles without giving adequate information about their radioactivity, with some claiming them to be non-radioactive while using quantities of thorium of up to 259milligrams per mantle.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{collimated}} image {{produced by}} the sight is only truly parallax free at infinity, the sight has an error circle equal to {{the diameter of the}} collimating optics for any target at a finite distance. Depending on the eye position behind the sight and the closeness of the target this induces some aiming error. For larger targets at a distance (given the non-magnifying, quick target acquisitions nature of the sight) this aiming error is considered trivial. On small arms aimed at close targets this is compensated for by keeping the reticle {{in the middle of the}} optical window (sighting down its optical axis). <b>Some</b> <b>manufacturers</b> of small arms sights also make models with the optical collimator set at a finite distance. This gives the sight parallax due to eye movement the size of the optical window at close range which diminishes to a minimal size at the set distance (somewhere around a desired target range of 25-50 yards).|$|E

25|$|While <b>some</b> <b>manufacturers</b> are {{competing}} for the smallest size with the biggest memory, <b>some</b> <b>manufacturers</b> differentiate their products by using elaborate housings, which are often bulky and make the drive difficult to connect to the USB port. Because the USB port connectors on a computer housing are often closely spaced, plugging a flash drive into a USB port may block an adjacent port.
