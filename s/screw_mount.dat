50|$|Because {{an attic}} fan {{is made of}} metal, and is also subject to {{lightning}} strikes if mounted on a roof, grounding is extremely important. On some attic fans, grounding is achieved through a <b>screw</b> <b>mounted</b> on the thermostat box of the attic fan. The grounding wire {{is attached to the}} box via the screw and thereby grounds the external metal components. Most modern attic fans have this as well as a grounding wire connected directly to the motor, thereby ensuring all parts are grounded.|$|R

50|$|The Digital HERO5 {{was first}} {{introduced}} on December 5, 2006. It had a 5-megapixel still photo sensor and supported standard definition (512×384) video capture. It ran on two AAA batteries, had 16 MB of internal memory and could function with a 2 GB SD card. Its housing was rated to 100 ft/30 meters depth. Its dimensions were 2.6 × 1.75 × 1.25 inches (66 × 44 × 32 mm). The camera is not designed {{to work with the}} newer HD HERO line of housings, although the standard <b>screw</b> <b>mounts</b> are indeed compatible.|$|R

50|$|There {{were two}} {{precursors}} {{to the introduction}} of SA-mount cameras, the manual-focus Sigma Mark-I in 1976, which still featured a M42 <b>screw</b> lens <b>mount,</b> and the SA-1 of 1983 with Pentax K-mount.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} issue Bass VI had three Stratocaster-style single coil pickups (although the internal construction was {{more similar to}} the Telecaster's bridge pickup with its metal base and <b>mounting</b> <b>screws),</b> which were <b>mounted</b> in special chrome rings and were controlled {{by a panel of}} three on/off slider switches rather than the conventional three-position switch.|$|R

The [...] M42 thread mount (originally {{created by}} Contax, but {{sometimes}} {{also referred to}} as Pentax <b>screw</b> <b>mount,</b> or universal <b>screw</b> <b>mount,</b> or TM for thread mount) was widely used among many manufacturers and was also easily mated to other camera mounts with simple adapters, making these lenses widely used and appreciated.|$|E
5000|$|... 1971: Praktica LLC (East Germany)(really December 1969): first {{interchangeable}} lens camera with electric contact lens mount, first camera with electromechanical lens diaphragm stopdown control. Had M42 <b>screw</b> <b>mount</b> modified for open aperture metering. The M42 mount {{was a very}} popular {{interchangeable lens}} mount system for a quarter century. It was used by almost two dozen different SLR brands, most notably Asahi Pentax. (Asahi became so closely associated with this mount that it was, and still is, often erroneously {{referred to as the}} Pentax <b>screw</b> <b>mount.)</b> However, by the early 1970s, the M42's limitations, especially no provision for auto-diaphragm lens open aperture viewing and metering, were becoming serious liabilities. After unpopular and uncoordinated attempts to modify the <b>screw</b> <b>mount</b> to support auto-diaphragm lenses with open aperture metering, Asahi abandoned the M42 <b>screw</b> <b>mount</b> in 1975, effectively ending production of this lens mounting system.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDesign,technology and {{properties}} of a completely ceramic piezoelectric pressure sensor are described. The sensor {{is made of}} the LTCC (Low Temperature Co-fired Ceramics) with PZT (Lead Zirconate Titanate) transducer and is designed to withstand pressure up to 10 MPa. The device is a sensor and a package simultaneously. It can be directly <b>screw</b> <b>mounted</b> to a flat surface with a hole supplying a pressure. Two methods of detection are considered: shift of the resonant frequency for static loads detection and charge response for dynamically changing load. Measurements are carried out for maximum 6 MPa pressure. The sensor exhibits linear charge response and resonant frequency shift in tested range...|$|R
5000|$|Americus's {{innovation}} was {{the addition}} of an [...] "escapement" [...] to Silbermann's realization of a string striking action design. Unlike Cristofori's design (to which of course Americus had no access) which interposed an intermediate lever between the lever that the key lifts and the striking hammer, Americus placed an upstanding wooden [...] "jack" [...] pivoting from this lever acting directly on a leather clothed notch in the hammer butt. An adjustable <b>screw</b> <b>mounted</b> underneath the hammer flange support rail, known as a [...] "set-off", impacts upon the jack, disengaging it from the hammer which is thus launched into free flight before it strikes its course of strings.|$|R
50|$|Tower mills, {{often called}} {{vertical}} mills, stirred mills or regrind mills, are {{a more efficient}} means of grinding material at smaller particle sizes, {{and can be used}} after ball mills in a grinding process. Like ball mills, grinding (steel) balls or pebbles are often added to stirred mills to help grind ore, however these mills contain a large <b>screw</b> <b>mounted</b> vertically to lift and grind material. In tower mills, there is no cascading action as in standard grinding mills. Stirred mills are also common for mixing quicklime (CaO) into a lime slurry. There are several advantages to the tower mill: low noise, efficient energy usage, and low operating costs.|$|R
