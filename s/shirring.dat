25|$|The Shoulders: the Neapolitan jacket has no {{shoulder}} padding. Neapolitan tailors {{removed the}} shoulder padding from their jackets {{in order to}} provide more freedom of movement. For this reason, the Neapolitan shoulder on informal jackets is sewn like a shirt sleeve (“spalla a camicia”) and it follows the natural curve of the human body rather than give it shape. This type of sleeve is cut about 10 cm larger than the armhole, and it can be finished with the “repecchia” – that visually interesting <b>shirring</b> the tailor creates with the extra fabric. This little flair, which supposedly allows for even more freedom of movement, is known as “manica a mappina”, and it gives the jacket a beautiful “rugged” appearance. For formal occasions, the Neapolitan shoulder features a “rollino” – a little roll of padding that raises the sleeve head to drape more cleanly.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Shirred</b> eggs, {{also known}} as baked eggs, are eggs that have been baked in a {{flat-bottomed}} dish; the name originates from the type of dish {{in which it was}} traditionally baked. <b>Shirred</b> eggs are considered a simple and reliable dish that can be easily varied and expanded upon.

60|$|Anne {{took the}} dress {{and looked at}} it in reverent silence. Oh, how pretty it was--a lovely soft brown gloria with all the gloss of silk; a skirt with dainty frills and shirrings; a waist elaborately pin-tucked in the most fashionable way, with a little ruffle of filmy lace at the neck. But the sleeves--they were the {{crowning}} glory! Long elbow cuffs, and above them two beautiful puffs divided by rows of <b>shirring</b> and bows of brown silk ribbon.|$|E
60|$|The {{newcomer}} was gorgeously arrayed in a {{pale blue}} summer silk, puffed, frilled, and shirred wherever puff, frill, or <b>shirring</b> could possibly be placed. Her head was surmounted by a huge white chiffon hat, bedecked with three long but rather stringy ostrich feathers. A veil of pink chiffon, lavishly sprinkled with huge black dots, hung like a flounce from the hat brim to her shoulders and floated off in two airy streamers behind her. She wore all the jewelry that could be crowded on one small woman, and a very strong odor of perfume attended her.|$|E
60|$|The {{next two}} days were so wet and windy {{that there was no}} going out; but on the {{succeeding}} one the sun shone brightly, and I {{had the good fortune to}} capture one of the most magnificent insects the world contains, the great bird-winged butterfly, Ornithoptera Poseidon. I trembled with excitement as I saw it coming majestically towards me, and could hardly believe I had really succeeded in my stroke till I had taken it out of the net and was gazing, lost in admiration, at the velvet black and brilliant green of its wings, seven inches across, its bolder body, and crimson breast. It is true I had seen similar insects in cabinets at home, but it is quite another thing to capture such oneself-to feel it struggling between one's fingers, and to gaze upon its fresh and living beauty, a bright gem <b>shirring</b> out amid the silent gloom of a dark and tangled forest. The village of Dobbo held that evening at least one contented man.|$|E

50|$|<b>Shirred</b> {{eggs are}} eggs {{that have been}} baked in a gratin dish with a flat bottom. Traditionally they have been cooked in a dish called a shirrer, from which the dish gets its name, but the name now applies {{regardless}} {{of the type of}} dish in which they are baked. They differ from eggs en cocotte, which are baked in a ramekin sitting in a bain-marie, or water bath. <b>Shirred</b> eggs can be served at breakfast, brunch, lunch, or any other time of day. They are typically baked simply with butter until the whites have set and the yolks are thickened, and are usually served in the dish in which they were baked.|$|R
5000|$|Cellulose, usually from {{cotton linters}} or wood pulp, is {{processed}} to make viscose, {{which is then}} extruded into clear, tough casings for making wieners and franks. They also are <b>shirred</b> for easier use and can be treated with dye to make [...] "red hots". The casing is peeled off after cooking, resulting in [...] "skinless" [...] franks. Cellulosic viscose solutions are combined with wood pulp to make large diameter fibrous casings for bologna, cotto salami, smoked ham and other products sliced for sandwiches. This type is also permeable to smoke and water vapor. They can be flat or <b>shirred,</b> depending on application, and can be pretreated with smoke, caramel color, or other surface treatments.|$|R

50|$|The {{fabric of}} the sweater can be ornamented with various textures, such as gathers, ruffles, pleats, ruching and <b>shirring.</b> Ornamental {{patterns}} can be added using beads, buttons, sequins, bobbles, ribbons and knots, as well as appliqué or cordwork.

The technique of <b>shirring</b> produces a similar effect by gathering the fabric in two parallel rows (not necessarily horizontal), usually by smocking.|$|E
