The sample comprises of 4, 388 firm-year observations for U. S companies and 792 firm-year observations for German companies for the period of 2004 - 2007. To capture accrual earnings management, we use discretionary accrual, and to capture real earnings management we sum standardized abnormal cash flow from operation (CFO), abnormal production costs, and abnormal discretionary expenses. The result indicates that German 19 s relatively principle-based GAAP yields higher level of accrual-based earnings management than US 19 s relatively rule-based GAAP.

40|$|Segmented {{labour market}} theory rests on two central tenets. The {{first is that}} it is {{meaningful}} to distinguish between primary labour markets providing "good" jobs with high wages and stable employment and secondary labour markets providing "bad" jobs with low pay and unstable employment. The second is that jobs in primary labour markets are rationed, with substantial barriers to entry from secondary labour markets. The rationing hypothesis cannot be tested for Ireland with the data available, but here we test the hypothesis that wage determination differs across sectors, using data from a 1987 ESRI household survey. Two formulations of the segmented labour market model are tested, one distinguishing only primary and secondary sectors and the other distinguishing four sectors employed in recent US research by Gordon.

While most of the papers on this topic are drawn from (emerging) Latin American, Asian or some African countries, Madagascar represents an interesting case. So far, very few studies in general, even less so in Sub-Saharan Africa, used panel data to provide evidence of the informal sector heterogeneity. Taking advantage of the 1 - 2 - 3 Surveys in Madagascar, a four-wave panel dataset (2000 - 2004), we assess the magnitude of various formal/informal sector earnings gaps. Is there an informal sector job earnings penalty? Do some informal sector jobs provide pecuniary premiums and which ones? Do possible gaps vary along the earnings distribution?

40|$|Personnel {{economics}} {{has developed}} as a distinctive discipline within economics.   The growth {{in this area of}} economics has been predominately theoretical in nature {{due to the lack of}} available data.   Nevertheless, over the last 10 years several economists have gained access to personnel records of firms to test the predictions of the theoretical works in personnel economics.   This thesis follows in the spirit of the available empirical work using personnel records of a large financial sector firm operating in the UK over the period 1989 to 2001, empirically investigating the evolution of earnings distributions and gender pay differences in the internal labour market of this firm. The thesis initially replicates findings on the structure of earnings between incumbents and outsiders (entrants) as outlined in Baker, Gibbs and Holmstrom (1994 b).   The key questions are whether movements of wages over time are consistent with the theoretical notion of an internal labour market and whether incumbents do better than outsiders.   Secondly, the thesis explores more closely the evolution of earnings distribution of a particular cohort in a quantile regression framework.   Finally, a central proposition in the personnel economics literature is re-examined as outlined in Medoff and Abraham (1980, 1981) on estimating the returns to tenure with <b>standard</b> <b>earnings</b> functions.   The thesis offers a reinterpretation of the Medoff and Abraham results using a new methodology as outlined in DiNardo et al (1996) constructing counterfactual density estimates of earnings distributions.   The empirical results bear evidence of a clear and unambiguous negative bias in the returns to tenure making a contribution to recently discussed ideas about the interpretation of observed wage functions as wage offer functions supporting the Stevens (2003) conjecture that the returns to tenure are negatively biased.

The results have been compared with earlier studies into local labour markets {{in an attempt to}} clarify the degree of economic rationality that prevails in the earnings of manual workers. (Analysis of the travel to work patterns of a sub sample of these manual workers established the practical usefulness of the concept of the local labour market). Whilst a wide range of median <b>standard</b> hourly <b>earnings</b> was found for similar jobs, the coefficient of variation was appreciably lower than that found in earlier local labour market studies. Most of the 20 firms retained their general rank order in relation to each other over the period, and a common internal hierarchy of earnings by manual workers was displayed. During the period inter and intra occupational differentials decreased in a marked fashion. The labour turnover and completed length of service patterns of the manual workers showed wide variations as between firms, in line with earlier studies.

These results also underline the importance of local labour studies in understanding pay structures and the phenomenon of labour wastage, and indicate a need for further research in this area...|$|R

Further, as predicted by the specific training hypothesis, the more mobile individuals are found to have smaller on-the-job earnings gains in absolute terms than the less mobile. Job mobility is an important characteristic of the working life histories of men. According to the U. S.

Although job changing is a common characteristic of workers, what proportion of earnings growth actually takes place between jobs and how does this proportion differ across groups of individuals? This paper provides direct evidence on this question by calculating, for different race-education grtiups, the actual amounts of earnings growth that occurred on the job and between jobs.

Hughes and Nolan (1997) looked at wage dispersion across sectors from a segmented labour market perspective, which distinguishes between primary labour markets providing "good " jobs with high wages and stable employment and secondary labour markets providing "bad " jobs with low pay and unstable employment. The core hypothesis of the approach is that jobs in primary labour markets are rationed, with substantial barriers to entry from secondary labour markets. The rationing hypothesis cannot be tested for Ireland with the data available, but this paper tests the hypothesis that wage determination differs across sectors, using data from a 1987 ESRI household survey.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{an empirical}} {{investigation into the}} distributive effects of over- and under-education, defined as market outcomes such that some workers possess skills over or below those required at their jobs respectively. This type of market failure can arise in assignment and search equilibrium settings, {{as well as in}} the presence of asymmetric information regarding workers 2 ̆ 7 performance on the job. The existence of permanent and sizable mismatch rates means that returns to education are depressed for over-educated workers and inflated for under-qualified workers. Thus, irreversible decisions to invest in human capital are made in a context of uncertainty regarding the exact outcomes that might arise. As in the Todaro model, where individuals decide whether to migrate to cities based on the expected values of the available alternatives, workers might decide it is worthwhile to keep investing in education even if the probability of finding appropriate employment is falling. The three chapters of the dissertation are entitled: 2 ̆ 2 Skill Mismatch and Earnings: A Panel analysis of the U. S. Labor Market, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Earnings Inequality and Skill Mismatch in the U. S: 1973 – 2003, 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Employment and Distribution Effects of Changes in the Minimum Wage. 2 ̆ 2 ^ Skill mismatch and earnings: A panel analysis of the U. S. labor market. This chapter examines the effect on earnings induced by a mismatch between workers 2 ̆ 7 skills and the skills actually required on the job. It uses the Current Population Survey (CPS) for the period 1983 – 2002. The special re-interview methodology of the CPS is used to create a large panel, so that individual heterogeneity can be controlled for. Skill requirements are estimated by the median education level for each 3 -digit occupation in the 1980 census occupational classification. The analysis, including the determination of skill requirements, is conducted for males and females separately. Cross-sectional analysis confirms the findings in the recent literature. Returns to required schooling are higher than the returns to attained education in <b>standard</b> <b>earnings</b> regressions. Also, for workers with similar educational attainment, over-education reduces earnings and under-education increases them. Contrary to what other studies have found, we conclude that these results are confirmed after controlling for individual fixed effects. The chapter also investigates which groups are more exposed to mismatch. I use standard probit analysis with over-education and under-education as the respective dependent variables. Women, service sector, and non-unionized workers appear to have higher probabilities of mismatch. ^ Earnings inequality and skill mismatch. This chapter shows that skill mismatch is a significant source of inequality in real earnings in the U. S. and that a substantial fraction of the increase in wage dispersion during the period 1973 – 2002 was due to the increase in mismatch rates and mismatch premia. Standard human capital earnings regressions that do not decompose the education variable into required, surplus, and deficit years provide biased estimates of the relative importance of education in explaining earnings inequality. In 2000 – 2002 surplus and deficit qualifications taken together accounted for 4 : 3 and 4 : 6 percent of the variance in earnings, or around 15 percent of the total explained variance. The dramatic increase in over-education rates and premia accounts for around 11 and 32 percent of the increase in the coefficient of variation of log earnings during the 30 years under analysis for males and females respectively. Residual inequality is slightly diminished when the estimating equation allows the prices of surplus, required and deficit qualifications to differ but the well-studied increasing trend of within-group inequality remains otherwise unchanged. Changes in the composition of the labor force are found to be important predictors of increasing residual inequality even when skill mismatch is taken into account. ^ The distributive effects of the minimum wage: An efficiency wage model with skill mismatch (co-authored with Peter Skott). This chapter analyzes the effect of changes in the real value of the minimum wage on the wage distribution. Changes in the minimum wage and other labor market institutions affect workers in all groups and empirically appear to be good complement to standard supply and demand arguments in explaining overall inequality. We use an efficiency wage model but allow for mismatch between jobs and workers. This framework yields predictions not only on the skill premium but also on the extent of inequality within groups. To keep matters as simple as possible, we assume that high-skill workers can get two types of jobs (good and bad), whereas low-skill workers have only one type of employment opportunity (bad). As long as some matches of high-skill workers and bad jobs are sustained in equilibrium, changes in the exogenous variables will affect not only wages and employment rates but also the degree of mismatch. Thus, this paper shows that 2 ̆ 7 over-education 2 ̆ 7 can be generated endogenously in efficiency wage models and that a fall in the real value of the minimum wage can (i) reduce total employment, (ii) lead to a simultaneous decline in both the relative employment and the relative wage of low-skill workers, and (iii) produce a rise in within-group as well as between-group inequality. Evidence from the US suggests that these theoretical results are empirically relevant. ...|$|E

We estimate a <b>standard</b> Mincerian <b>earnings</b> function, augmented by information on the women's training experience. The results indicate that there are positive and economically significant returns to education and training. We also investigate the determinants of training and find that training participation is positively related to educational attainment, while if women are credit-constrained, they are significantly less likely to undertake training. We also examine the issue of self-selection in training participation and find that self-selection does not appear to cause an upward bias to the estimated returns to training for our sample.

40|$|This paper formulates a {{structural}} dynamic programming model of preschool investment choices of altruistic parents and then empirically estimates the structural {{parameters of the}} model using the NLSY 79 data. The paper finds that preschool investment significantly boosts cognitive and non-cognitive skills, which enhance earnings and school outcomes. It also finds that a <b>standard</b> Mincer <b>earnings</b> function, by omitting measures of non-cognitive skills on the right hand side, overestimates the rate of return to schooling. From the estimated equilibrium Markov process, the paper studies the nature of within generation earnings distribution and intergenerational earnings and schooling mobility. The paper finds that a tax financed free preschool program {{for the children of}} poor socioeconomic status generates positive net gains to the society in terms of average earnings and higher intergenerational earnings and schooling mobility...|$|R
