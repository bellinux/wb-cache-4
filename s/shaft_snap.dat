40|$|Lightweight {{connector}} automatically aligns beams to be jointed, and withstands torsion, tension, and compression loads. One beam has connector, {{other has}} receptor. Bracket aligns connector and receptor. When actuated, spring in connector pushes shaft into receptor. Hooks on <b>shaft</b> <b>snap</b> to lock into receptor slots. Union can be separated easily without damage. Connectors {{are designed for}} in-space assembly, but may be suited to ground assemblies as well...|$|E
50|$|These {{resemble}} {{an expanding}} bolt except the <b>shaft</b> <b>snaps</b> {{below the surface}} when the tension is sufficient. The blind end may be either countersunk ('flush') or dome shaped.|$|R
50|$|His career came to {{an abrupt}} halt on a spring day in 1950, when he took an admiral aloft at the Navy's Lakehurst, New Jersey, base. Suddenly, a <b>shaft</b> <b>snapped,</b> and the tail rotor came apart.|$|R
50|$|In December 1900, her {{propeller}} <b>shaft</b> <b>snapped</b> {{and she had}} to be towed into Dakar. Galician {{went into}} service and in the same month went to Dakar to pick up passengers and mail from the disabled Dunottar Castle.|$|R
25|$|The {{memorial}} is sited on the Heugh, within view of Lutyens's Lindisfarne Castle and its gardens (by Lutyens and Gertrude Jekyll) {{and adjacent}} to the ruins of Lindisfarne Priory. It was severely damaged during winter storms in 1983–4; the <b>shaft</b> <b>snapped</b> in two {{as a result of}} exceptional winds and the top part was later replaced.|$|R
5000|$|Participants of a James Ray [...] "Spiritual Warrior" [...] {{exercise}} in 2006, after signing waivers, {{were told to}} put the sharp point of an arrow used in archery against the soft part of their necks and lean against the tip. A man named Kurt sustained injuries during this exercise as the <b>shaft</b> <b>snapped</b> and the arrow point deeply penetrated his eyebrow.|$|R
60|$|The great god had wounded him. But {{not to the}} heart. Felix, as {{good luck}} would have it, {{happened}} to be wearing buckled braces. He had worn them on board, and, {{like the rest of}} his costume, had, of course, never since been able to discard them. They stood him in good stead now. The buckle caught the very point of the bone-tipped spear, and broke the force of the blow, as the great god lunged forward. The wound was but a graze, and Tu-Kila-Kila's light <b>shaft</b> <b>snapped</b> short in the middle.|$|R
50|$|On September 22, 1909, (several {{newspapers}} {{report the}} date as Tuesday, September 21, 1909) Fung {{was the first}} Chinese man known to fly in America (and first aviator of any nationality to fly in California and the West Coast of the United States). He had constructed his own biplane, improving on the Wrights' blueprints. Fung flew in a wide circle, despite the harsh winds; after twenty minutes, however, the bolt holding the propeller to the <b>shaft</b> <b>snapped</b> off, and he was brought to a stop, suffering only minor bruising. The flight was reported in several papers, including the San Francisco Call and the Oakland Tribune.|$|R
6000|$|On the 7th of August 1850, a boy {{fourteen}} years of age, {{the son of}} a miner, slipped into the shaft of Boscaswell Down Mine, in the neighbourhood of Penzance. He fell to the depth of thirteen fathoms, or seventy-eight feet. Fifty-eight feet down, he struck his left side against a board placed across the <b>shaft,</b> <b>snapped</b> it in two, and then falling twenty feet more, pitched on his head. He was of course taken up insensible; the doctor was sent for; and on examining him, found, to his amazement, that there was actually a chance of the boy's recovery after this tremendous fall! ...|$|R
50|$|She {{was placed}} on the regular joint White Star - Shaw, Savill & Albion route from December 1884, managed by Shaw, Savill & Albion but crewed by White Star Line personnel. She had to be towed to Cape Town after her {{propeller}} <b>shaft</b> <b>snapped</b> in 1893, and in 1894 she was extensively refitted by Harland and Wolff. In December 1899 she transported horses to the Cape during the Second Boer War, and in April 1900 was chartered by the Spanish government to repatriate troops from Manila after the Spanish-American War. Ionic was sold later that year to the Aberdeen Line as a replacement for their , which had been lost in September 1899. The Aberdeen Line renamed her SS Sophocles. She made her final voyage in August 1906, and was scrapped by Thos W Ward at Morecambe, Lancashire in April 1908.|$|R
5000|$|The car's second race {{meeting at}} Goodwood {{a month later}} was {{considerably}} more encouraging despite very wet conditions, with Reg Parnell winning not only the minor Woodcote Cup but also the full Formula One Goodwood Trophy later that same day. [...] "All we need now is a little longer time to develop it and then we hope to show the continent what we really can do" [...] said Parnell after the race, but in truth the cold conditions had masked overheating problems that would later {{come back to haunt}} the team. The final outing for 1950 came with a two car entry at the Spanish Grand Prix, but after qualifying fourth and fifth Parnell was out early when his supercharger's drive <b>shaft</b> <b>snapped</b> before Peter Walker retired at two-thirds distance because of an oil leak in his gearbox.|$|R
50|$|Each hoplite {{provided}} his own equipment. The primary hoplite {{weapon was}} a spear around 2.4 m in length called a dory. Although accounts of its length vary, {{it is usually}} now {{believed to have been}} seven to nine feet long (~2.1-2.7 m). It was held one-handed, with the other hand holding the hoplite's shield (called Aspis). The spearhead was usually a curved leaf shape, while the rear of the spear had a spike called a sauroter ('lizard-killer') which was used to stand the spear in the ground (hence the name). It was also used as a secondary weapon if the main <b>shaft</b> <b>snapped</b> or to kill enemies lying on the ground as the formation passed over. This was a common problem, especially for soldiers who were involved with the initial clash with the enemy. Despite the snapping of the spear, Hoplites could easily switch to the sauroter without great consequence. The rear ranks used the secondary end to finish off fallen opponents as the phalanx advanced over them.|$|R
25|$|While Sampo had {{not been}} damaged in the war, she was docked at the Hietalahti {{shipyard}} for extensive maintenance and repairs — when she left to the port of Hanko in mid-February 1919, 69 bottom plates had been replaced. In December 1922 Sampo struck a rock in the port of Loviisa and her bow propeller shaft was damaged, {{but there was no}} time for repairs and for the rest of the season she had to assist ships to the port of Helsinki without her bow propeller. Another incident occurred on 24 March 1926 when the bow propeller of Sampo hit a stone bank in the port of Helsinki, came loose and dropped to the bottom. It was found after searching for a couple of days and winched on board. On 30 March, while Sampo was assisting a Finnish steamship Albert Kasimir, the stern propeller <b>shaft</b> <b>snapped</b> when the engine was reversed and the propeller dropped to the bottom. While the icebreaker still had its bow propeller, it was of no use as it was waiting for installation on the foredeck. Murtaja towed the immobilized icebreaker to Hanko on the following day and to Helsinki for repairs on 20 April.|$|R
50|$|The main {{offensive}} weapon used was a 2.4 - 4.5 m long and 2.5 cm in diameter spear called a doru, or dory. It was held {{with the right}} hand, with the left hand holding the hoplite's shield. Soldiers usually held their spears in an underhand position when approaching but once they came into close contact with their opponents, they were held in an overhand position ready to strike. The spearhead was usually a curved leaf shape, while {{the rear of the}} spear had a spike called a sauroter ("lizard-killer") which was used to stand the spear in the ground (hence the name). It was also used as a secondary weapon if the main <b>shaft</b> <b>snapped,</b> or for the rear ranks to finish off fallen opponents as the phalanx advanced over them. In addition to being used as a secondary weapon, the sauroter also doubled to balance the spear, but not for throwing purposes. It is a matter of contention, among historians, whether the hoplite used the spear overarm or underarm. Held underarm, the thrusts would have been less powerful but under more control, and vice versa. It seems likely that both motions were used, depending on the situation. If attack was called for, an overarm motion was more likely to break through an opponent's defence. The upward thrust is more easily deflected by armour due to its lesser leverage. However, when defending, an underarm carry absorbed more shock and could be 'couched' under the shoulder for maximum stability. It should also be said that an overarm motion would allow more effective combination of the aspis and doru if the shield wall had broken down, while the underarm motion would be more effective when the shield had to be interlocked with those of one's neighbours in the battle-line. Hoplites in the rows behind the lead would almost certainly have made overarm thrusts. The rear ranks held their spears underarm, and raised their shields upwards at increasing angles. This was an effective defence against missiles, deflecting their force.|$|R
50|$|The Danmark {{had fought}} high winds and high seas from March 24, 1889. On April 4, 1889, the winds {{had become more}} violent, and the swells which the Danmark rode were mountainous. Most of the {{passengers}} became ill. By April 5, 1889, the Danmark was in terrible trouble and sinking, having survived high winds but with a severely damaged hull from a hole caused by her propeller <b>shaft</b> when it <b>snapped.</b> The ship was unable to make any headway because its engines were kept running so that the pumps could keep pumping the water to keep the ship from sinking. The Captain C.B. Knudsen had considered abandoning the ship but was concerned that the lifeboats would be overturned in the high seas.|$|R
60|$|The {{construction}} of the spears thus used is peculiar. The head is a straight piece of elk horn, about seven inches long, {{on the point of}} which an artificial barb is made fast, with twine well gummed. The head is stuck {{on the end of the}} shaft, a very long pole of willow, to which it is likewise connected by a strong cord, a few inches in length. When the spearsman makes a sure blow, he often strikes the head of the spear through the body of the fish. It comes off easily, and leaves the salmon struggling with the string through its body, while the pole is still held by the spearsman. Were it not for the precaution of the string, the willow <b>shaft</b> would be <b>snapped</b> by the struggles and the weight of the fish. Mr. Miller, in the course of his wanderings, had been at these falls, and had seen several thousand salmon taken in the course of one afternoon. He declared that he had seen a salmon leap a distance of about thirty feet, from the commencement of the foam at the foot of the falls, completely to the top.|$|R
