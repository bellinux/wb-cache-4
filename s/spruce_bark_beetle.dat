5000|$|The fire began June 19, 2007, when sparks {{created by}} a {{hand-held}} grinder being used to sharpen a shovel ignited dry grass.

50|$|Between 1987 and 2000 {{the largest}} known {{epidemic}} of <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> (Dendroctonus rufipennis) caused {{the death of}} 90% of white, Sitka, and hybrid Lutz spruce, {{almost all of the}} mature spruce trees, in a 3.2 million acre forest in the Kenai Peninsula and Copper River. The <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> {{is a part of the}} native ecosystem, mainly hosted by the white spruce of the dryer interior, in south-central Alaska where the tree loss occurred in apparently healthy old growth forest. One theory about the decimation of trees is that warmer spring and summer temperatures have allowed the beetles an annual reproductive cycle, shortened from every two to three years, while warmer winter temperatures have increased the number of beetles that live through winter to reproduce in spring. In addition to increased temperatures, increased aridity in the region has created dryer forests lowering the production of sap, a barrier defense against insect and fungal pests, in the spruces. Lutz spruces, like its primary host, the white spruce, are more susceptible to bark beetle damage and suffer a higher mortality rate when infected.|$|E

Some of the marked beetles were recaptured with pheromone-baited traps in two experiments: (I) traps at 10 m and (2) traps 30, 60, 90, and 120 m distances from the release point.

Twelve natural forest stands and one plantation were analyzed. The average numbers of desiccated Norway spruces per stand and isoenzyme gene markers were used for comparison purposes. The results indicate that the Norway spruce population from Mt Vlašić deviates markedly from the other sampled populations, both in genetic structure and in the recorded numbers of insects, {{as well as in the}} number of desiccated trees. These results suggest the importance of using only indigenous Norway spruce reproductive material in artificial forest regeneration to ensure its higher adaptability potential.

All trap models proved to be efficient and gave high captures of beetles during operation for one summer season (2013). Ranking the trap models in descending order of total capture of beetles gave this list: Lindgren trap, Theysohn, prototype-P, Ecotrap, BEKA, and prototype-K. However, there was much variation in trapping results between localities for all trap models, and the estimated means did in most cases not differ significantly between models. The estimated mean capture of the Lindgren trap was significantly higher than for prototype-K and BEKA, but their confidence intervals were wide and they were close to being insignificantly different. The retail price of the traps vary from about 10 € (Ecotrap) to 50 - 55 € (Lindgren), while prices are not available for the two prototypes, which are not in regular production.

Kachemak Bay State Park was the first legislatively {{designated}} state park in the Alaska State Parks system. Kachemak Bay State Wilderness Park is the state's only legislatively designated wilderness park. There is no road access to most areas of the park, visitors normally fly in or travel by boat from Homer. Kachemak Bay is considered a critical habitat area due to the biodiversity in the area. Wildlife within the park includes marine mammals such as sea otters, sea lions, and whales, large land mammals such as moose and black bears, and numerous sea and land birds. Terrain consists of both rocky and sandy beaches, dense mountain forests, and higher up, glaciers, and icefields. Because of the rugged conditions and unpredictable coastal weather, visitors are advised {{to be prepared for}} sudden wind, rain, or snowstorms at any time of year, especially at higher elevations, and to file a travel plan with rangers. The park is mostly wild land, although there are a few cabins and semi-developed campgrounds. The park ranger station is located in Halibut Cove Lagoon. The Kachemak Bay area was infested with <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> during the late 1990s, and thousands of acres of dead trees are still standing within the park.

40|$|While phylogeographic {{patterns}} of organisms are often interpreted through past environmental disturbances, mediated by climate changes, and geographic barriers, {{they may also}} be strongly influenced by species-specific traits. To investigate the impact of such traits, we focused on two Eurasian <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> that share a similar geographical distribution, but differ in their ecology and reproduction. Ips typographus is an aggressive tree-killing species characterized by strong dispersal, whereas Dendroctonus micans is a discrete inbreeding species (sib-mating is the rule), parasite of living trees and a poor disperser. We compared genetic variation between the two species over both beetles' entire range in Eurasia with five independent gene fragments, to evaluate whether their intrinsic differences could have an influence over their phylogeographic patterns. We highlighted widely divergent {{patterns of}} genetic variation for the two species, and argue that the difference is indeed largely compatible with their contrasting dispersal strategies and modes of reproduction. In addition, genetic structure in I. typographus divides European populations in a northern and a southern group, as was previously observed for its host plant, and suggests past allopatric divergence. A long divergence time was estimated between East Asian and other populations of both species, indicating their long-standing presence in Eurasia, prior to the last glacial maximum. Finally, the strong population structure observed in D. micans for the mitochondrial locus provides insights into the recent colonization history of this species, from its native European range to regions where it was recently introduced.
