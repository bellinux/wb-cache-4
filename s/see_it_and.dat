5|$|It was {{announced}} that the auction would take place on 23 October 1969, with the diamond listed as lot 133, at Parke-Bernet in New York City. The diamond was flown to Gstaad in Switzerland so that the actress Elizabeth Taylor could <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> flown back to the United States for the auction. Taylor's husband, the actor Richard Burton, had set a maximum bid of $1 million for the diamond, with his lawyer, Aaron Frosch, bidding on the telephone from London, and Al Yugler of the jewellers Frank Pollock and Sons, bidding in the room for Burton.|$|E

It began on March 15 at the House of Blues in Dallas and concluded on June 8 at Stubb's in Austin, Texas. Some concert dates featured electronic music duo Quadron as an opening act. The tour included performances at music festivals such as South by Southwest and Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, for which Saadiq played songs from The Way I <b>See</b> <b>It</b> <b>and</b> Stone Rollin, as well as unreleased material.|$|E
5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of −1.46, Sirius is {{the brightest star}} system in the night sky, almost twice {{the brightness of the}} second brightest star, Canopus. It is not as bright as the Moon, Venus, or Jupiter; at times, Mercury and Mars are also brighter than Sirius. Sirius can be seen from almost everywhere on Earth, with only observers north of 73 degrees latitude unable to <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> it does not rise very high when viewed from some northern cities, reaching only 13° above the horizon from Saint Petersburg. Sirius, along with Procyon and Betelgeuse, forms one of the three vertices of the Winter Triangle to observers in the Northern Hemisphere. Due to its declination of roughly −17°, Sirius is a circumpolar star from latitudes south of 73° S. From the Southern Hemisphere in early July, Sirius can be seen in both the evening where it sets after the Sun, and in the morning where it rises before the Sun. Due to precession (and slight proper motion), Sirius will move further south in the future. Starting around the year 9000, Sirius will no longer be visible from northern and central Europe, and in 14000 its declination will be −67° and thus it will be circumpolar throughout South Africa and in most parts of Australia.|$|E

25|$|This play {{portrays a}} family in a ferociously {{negative}} light as the parents and two sons express accusations, blame, and resentments – qualities which are often paired with pathetic and self-defeating attempts at affection, encouragement, tenderness, and yearnings for things to be otherwise. The pain of this family is made worse by their depth of self-understanding and self-analysis, combined with a brutal honesty, as they <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> an ability to boldly express themselves. The story deals with the mother’s addiction to morphine, the family’s addiction to whiskey, the father’s miserliness, the older brother’s licentiousness, and younger brother’s illness.|$|E

She is highly suspicious of Bodger and believes that he is hiding something in his hotel, although she never actually finds out about Badger. She refuses to recommend Bodger's hotel to tourists because he accidentally covered her in mashed potato when she visited his B & B. She dislikes people having fun on the beach outside her office and {{will do anything to}} prevent it. She has a lot of trouble with China the dog, who is always hanging around her office.

500|$|According to Brungardt, the {{recording}} of the project's earlier songs, [...] "Heart Attack", was critical in their decision for the album. The song was recorded during Saadiq's break from touring for The Way I <b>See</b> <b>It</b> <b>and</b> had originally featured that album's sound, {{with which they were}} not satisfied. When they revisited the song, Saadiq reconstructed the original recording after stripping track's individually recorded instrument parts, {{with the exception of the}} vocals and some of its drums. In an interview for EQ Magazine, Brungardt said of their approach, [...] "We wanted to evolve the songs, and I wanted to evolve the engineering, as well. On The Way I See It, everything was pretty much tube pre's and tube compressors. On this one, I wanted to play around with some of the more solid-state gear".|$|E

500|$|In 2012, The Devil Inside, a low-budget {{found footage}} horror film {{following}} in the steps of Cloverfield, opened the weekend after New Year's Day. Critics, for whom {{it had not been}} screened, reviewed it harshly if and when they did <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> audiences reacted angrily to the film's abrupt ending, which directed them to a website for more information. Yet, as Cargill notes, its success was proof that even on that low-potential weekend, a disengaged audience will [...] "throw money at a terrible movie if it looks like it's good." [...] The film's opening weekend take of $33.7 million ranks in the top ten for January. The Devil Inside went on to make over $50 million domestically and almost that much abroad to break $100 million in total receipts.|$|E
500|$|Music writer Robert Christgau said Saadiq's {{compositions}} {{are characterized}} by [...] "groove rather than song". Andy Kellman of AllMusic wrote that the songs are [...] "tied together by the Mellotron, a vintage keyboard — commonly associated with psychedelic and progressive rock recordings, but not foreign to soul — that evokes diseased flutes and wheezing strings", adding that [...] "Saadiq tends to use the instrument for shading". Music journalist Jim DeRogatis observed [...] "a little less Motown gloss" [...] than The Way I <b>See</b> <b>It</b> <b>and</b> [...] "a little more rock grit in Saadiq’s grooves, heavy on the Sly Stone (witness the opening 'Heart Attack'), late '50s/early '60s Isley Brothers (the joyful 'Radio'), and Ray Charles ('Day Dreams'), {{to say nothing of}} the skillful use of Mellotron orchestrations as a connecting thread throughout the disc, sort of like the Moody Blues suddenly finding the funk ('The Answer')." [...] Steve Horowitz from PopMatters found the songs' subject matter to be assorted and said that Saadiq [...] "personalizes each song so they seem connected as just the many aspects of one man’s existence and experience".|$|E
500|$|Detailing and {{protesting the}} ugliness {{of life is}} a common theme {{throughout}} the history of Spanish art, from the dwarves of Diego Velázquez to Pablo Picasso's Guernica (1937). Reflecting on The Disasters of War, biographer Margherita Abbruzzese notes that Goya asks that the truth [...] "be seen and... shown to others; including those who have no wish to <b>see</b> <b>it....</b> <b>And</b> the blind in spirit stay their eyes on the outward aspect of things, then these outward aspects must be twisted and deformed until they cry out what they are trying to say." [...] The series follows a wider European tradition of war art and the examination of the effect of military conflict on civilian life—probably mostly known to Goya via prints. This tradition is reflected especially in Dutch depictions of the Eighty Years' War with Spain, and in the work of 16th-century German artists like Hans Baldung. It is believed Goya owned a copy of a famous set of 18 etchings by Jacques Callot known as Les Grandes Misères de la guerre (1633), which record the devastating impact on Lorraine of LouisXIII's troops during the Thirty Years' War.|$|E

500|$|Marochetti's {{creation}} of the clay model of the statue involved not only the sculptor himself but also the painter Victor Mottez, King Louis Philippe's personal physician Henri Gueneau de Mussy and the singers Mario and Garcia, all of whom contributed manual input. A clay model of the statue was displayed as one of two statues positioned outside the western entrance of the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park. Unfortunately it was so poorly assembled that shortly after {{the opening of the}} exhibition on 1 May 1851, the horse's tail fell off. It was repaired and the statue eventually attracted critical acclaim. The art critic John Ruskin said of the model, [...] "it will tend more to educate the public with respect to art than anything we have done for centuries". It came to be {{regarded as one of the}} more popular items in the exhibition and Prince Albert personally took King Leopold to <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> the statue by Simonis, which now stands in the Grand Place of Brussels. The Art Journal was later to describe it as [...] "unquestionably a vigorous and spirited example of the bravura class of sculpture." ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{versions}} of the song are present on the album; the English-language version features vocals from English rapper Dizzee Rascal (who also wrote the lyrics of his parts), while the Spanish-language version features El Cata. Speaking about the collaboration, Dizzee Rascal said that [...] "I know it sounds a bit mad now, but you'll <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>and</b> see what's going on". He further said [...] "It's me doing something different man, on a merengue tip." [...] In an interview with Billboard, Dizzee Rascal said about Shakira that, [...] "she's {{a bit of a}} trendsetter -- she does loads of different things on a major scale" [...] and added [...] "You'd expect her to use an American rapper , but she chose me. It meant a lot." [...] He then commented about the song that, [...] "I'd like to be in that Spanish market. I got into the whole reggaeton thing when it came out, so I always wanted to get around to something like that". [...] "Loca" [...] served as the lead single from Sale el Sol. The Spanish version of the song, featuring El Cata, was released on 10 September 2010. The English version, featuring Dizzee Rascal, debuted later on 13 September 2010.|$|E
500|$|... "Much {{has been}} written about that scene ... most of it silly," [...] wrote Gene Lees in High Fidelity. The scene was {{inspired}} by two men who took off their clothes to antagonize the police during an informal anti-war gathering. [...] During [...] "Where Do I Go?", the stage was covered in a giant scrim, beneath which those choosing to participate in the scene removed their clothes. [...] At the musical cue, [...] "they [...] naked and motionless, their bodies bathed in Fisher's light projection of floral patterns. [...] They chant of 'beads, flowers, freedom, and happiness.'" [...] It lasted only twenty seconds. Indeed, the scene happened so quickly and was so dimly lit that it prompted Jack Benny, during the interval at a London preview, to quip, [...] "Did you happen to notice if any of them were Jewish?" [...] Nevertheless, the scene prompted threats of censorship and even violent reactions in some places. It also became fodder for pop-cultural jokes. Groucho Marx quipped, [...] "I was gonna go <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> <b>and</b> then I called up the theater. ... They said the tickets were $11 apiece.
