40|$|Abstract: Macroeconomic {{frameworks}} {{and social}} objectives {{need to be}} explicitly integrated at the conceptual stage. Macroeconomic policies aim at macroeconomic stability not as an end to itself, but as a necessary precondition for sustained growth, which is critical to poverty reduction. The range of available macroeconomic and social policy options may be constrained by a country’s situation, but the policies and reforms necessary for macroeconomic stability may themselves affect social and poverty outcomes, although there is always scope for increasing the pro-poor bias of macroeconomic policy through {{the choice of the}} appropriate policy instruments or the timing of reforms. However, integrating social and poverty reduction goals with macroeconomic goals is not simply about adding social policies to a pre-designed <b>sound</b> <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>framework.</b> It requires an full awareness of the tradeoffs and of both the short-and long-term impacts of macroeconomic policies on social outcomes and vice versa that can only be gained through an interdisciplinary approach that uses social, economic, institutional, and political analysis to identify the links and transmission mechanisms between macroeconomic policies, poverty, and livelihoods. This approach can contribute to enhanced public transparency and ownership, and identify the best policy combination for equitable growth, poverty reduction, and social justice...|$|E

40|$|This study {{provides}} a candid, systematic, and critical review of recent evidence on this complex subject. Based on {{a review of}} the literature and some new empirical evidence, it finds that (1) in spite of an apparently strong theoretical presumption, it is difficult to detect a strong and robust causal relationship between financial integration and economic growth; (2) contrary to theoretical predictions, financial integration appears to be associated with increases in consumption volatility (both in absolute terms and relative to income volatility) in many developing countries; and (3) there appear to be threshold effects in both of these relationships, which may be related to absorptive capacity. Some recent evidence suggests that <b>sound</b> <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>frameworks</b> and, in particular, good governance are both quantitatively and qualitatively important in affecting developing countries’ experiences with financial globalization.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{framework}} {{to check for}} consistency between the IMF''s standard country surveillance tool, namely medium-term projections of the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>framework</b> (including the real, fiscal, external, and monetary sectors), and the financial sector. Consistency here entails that the financial sector remain solvent in the medium term under the assumptions of the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>framework</b> and that the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>framework</b> is fine-tuned should threats to financial sector solvency arise {{as a result of}} assumptions underlying the medium-term <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>framework</b> projections. The proposed framework {{can also be used to}} conduct sensitivity analysis of the aggregated financial sector to various types of risks, including foreign exchange, interest rate, and credit risk. For surveillance purposes, this framework can easily be integrated into one of the standard sectoral files so that any update to the <b>macroeconomic</b> <b>framework</b> automatically feeds into the financial sector medium-term projections. We anticipate the proposed framework to be of interest to IMF economists as well as outside analysts.
