25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} acts was the reform regarding the central administration of the State, with which Crispi wished to strengthen the role of head of government. The bill aimed to separate the roles of the government from those of parliament, trying to untie the first by the political games of the second. The first point of the law was to give the cabinet the right to decide on the number and functions of the ministries. The prospect was also to keep the King (as well as provided the Albertine Statute) free to decide on the organization of the various ministries. Moreover the reform provided the establishment of the secretaries, who were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> ministers and, at the same time, do them as spokesmen in parliament.|$|E
25|$|Kuhn {{states that}} the {{probabilistic}} tools used by verificationists are inherently inadequate for the task of deciding between conflicting theories, since they belong to the very paradigms they seek to compare. Similarly, observations that are intended to falsify a statement will fall {{under one of the}} paradigms they are <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> compare, and will therefore also be inadequate for the task. According to Kuhn, the concept of falsifiability is unhelpful for understanding why and how science has developed as it has. In the practice of science, scientists will only consider the possibility that a theory has been falsified if an alternative theory is available that they judge credible. If there is not, scientists will continue to adhere to the established conceptual framework. If a paradigm shift has occurred, the textbooks will be rewritten to state that the previous theory has been falsified.|$|E

500|$|One of {{the aims}} of the new team was to help Castillo Armas {{establish}} an intelligence agency that would be able to fight communism in Guatemala. Armas was pressured to create an anti-Communist task force, which he did on July 20—creating the National Committee of Defense Against Communism (Comité de Defensa Nacional contra el Comunismo). The purpose of this group was to create an anti-Communist bureaucracy and intelligence service but also to organize records and facilitate PBHistory. The Comité secretly received funds from the CIA, with the understanding that this fact could prove [...] "very embarrassing" [...] and that a new source would eventually need to be found. Although the Comité was theoretically an intelligence agency, it also had some police powers. It could order the arrest of anybody suspected of being a communist, and had oversight over all army and police authorities. The CIA team was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> it set up by creating a nucleus of information about people associated with the PGT.|$|E
500|$|A few of {{the elected}} kings left a lasting mark in the Commonwealth. Stephen Báthory was {{determined}} to reassert the deteriorated royal prerogative, {{at the cost of}} alienating the powerful noble families. Sigismund III, Władysław IV and John Casimir were all of the Swedish House of Vasa; preoccupation with foreign and dynastic affairs prevented them from making a major contribution to the stability of Poland-Lithuania. John III Sobieski commanded the allied Relief of Vienna operation in 1683, {{which turned out to be}} the last great victory of the [...] "Republic of Both Nations". Stanisław August Poniatowski, the last of the Polish kings, was a controversial figure. On the one hand he was a driving force behind the substantial and constructive reforms belatedly undertaken by the Commonwealth. On the other, by his weakness and lack of resolve, especially in dealing with imperial Russia, he doomed the reforms together with the country they were <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>help.</b>|$|E

2500|$|With 12:59 {{left in the}} game, Rams punter Ken Clark's 59-yard punt planted Pittsburgh back {{on their}} own 25-yard line. Then faced with 3rd down and 8, Bradshaw took the snap, faked a handoff, and then threw a pass to Stallworth, who was running a streak pattern {{down the middle of}} the field. [...] Stallworth caught the ball barely beyond the outstretched hand of Perry and took it all the way to the end zone for a 73-yard go-ahead {{touchdown}} to make the score 24–19 for the Steelers. The NFL Films highlight film notes that safety Eddie Brown was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Perry in covering Stallworth, but for some reason, Brown ignored the Steeler receiver. On the ensuing kickoff, the Rams tried a reverse, which resulted in poor field position.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{scenes are}} {{shortened}} and amalgamated to include {{only the most}} essential plot details: the three Death Eater trials Harry witnesses in the Pensieve are merged into one sequence; the characters of Bill Weasley, Charlie Weasley, Ludo Bagman, Winky, Narcissa Malfoy and Bertha Jorkins are absent, as well as Dobby, who was <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> Harry obtain Gillyweed for the second task. Instead, that scene was changed to involve Neville Longbottom. There is no train scene at the end where Rita Skeeter is revealed to be an illegal, unregistered animagus; Harry is never seen either receiving or giving away the 1,000 galleons in prize winnings. All of Sirius Black's lines are condensed into a single fireside conversation. The scene in which Crouch Jr. is taken back to Azkaban {{is different from the}} book, in which he was [...] "killed" [...] by a Dementor summoned by Cornelius Fudge. There is also no conversation in which Fudge refuses to believe that Voldemort has returned, so this is explained in the next film.|$|E
2500|$|The {{effort of}} {{maintaining}} {{the role of a}} she-ro can be stressful. [...] The role encourages women to care for others rather than themselves, which the patient may find comforting, but this may lead to the reluctance or inability to ask for help they need or want which can lead to bitterness that their friends and family did not offer these services unbidden. The success of the patient's normalization efforts may paradoxically increase their dissatisfaction, as their apparent ability to handle it all discourages people from offering help. The breast cancer culture celebrates women who display the attitude deemed correct, which implies that their continued survival is due to this positive attitude and fighting spirit. While cheerfulness, hope, and good social support can be advantageous to health outcomes, it cannot determine survival rates. [...] Women who reject the she-ro model may find themselves socially isolated by the breast cancer support groups that are nominally <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> them. Support from [...] "the sisterhood" [...] favors the [...] "passionately pink", and tends to overlook those whose response is incompatible with the pink ribbon culture because it is angry, unhappy, or afraid.|$|E
2500|$|A main {{theme of}} Wilson's {{economic}} approach was to place enhanced emphasis on [...] "indicative economic planning". He {{created a new}} Department of Economic Affairs to generate ambitious targets that were in themselves <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>help</b> stimulate investment and growth (the government also created a Ministry of Technology (shortened to Mintech) to support the modernisation of industry). The DEA itself was in part intended {{to serve as an}} expansionary counter-weight to what Labour saw as the conservative influence of the Treasury, though the appointment of Wilson's deputy, George Brown, as the Minister in charge of the DEA was something of a two-edged sword, in view of Brown's reputation for erratic conduct; in any case the government's decision over its first three years to defend sterling's parity with traditional deflationary measures ran counter to hopes for an expansionist push for growth. Though now out of fashion, the faith in indicative planning as a pathway to growth, embodied in the DEA and Mintech, was at the time by no means confined to the Labour Party – Wilson built on foundations that had been laid by his Conservative predecessors, in the shape, for example, of the National Economic Development Council (known as [...] "Neddy") and its regional counterparts (the [...] "little Neddies"). Government intervention in industry was greatly enhanced, with the National Economic Development Office greatly strengthened, with the number of [...] "little Neddies" [...] was increased, from eight in 1964 to twenty-one in 1970. The government's policy of selective economic intervention was later characterised by the establishment of a new super-ministry of technology, under Tony Benn.|$|E

The other, and perhaps most devastating, issue was that Hunter's supply lines were being harassed by the 43rd Battalion Virginia Cavalry, under Lt. Col. John S. Mosby. Between May 20 and June 17, only one supply wagon had reached Hunter.|$|R
