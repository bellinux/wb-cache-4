5000|$|The bay's {{physical}} and biological characteristics make {{it one of}} the most significant estuarine areas in the Hudson River. The bay is deeper on its western side with a shipping channel of minimum 32 feet in depth and 300 feet in width.

We conducted experiments in a 5. 4 -m-long × 1. 5 -m-wide flume with a water depth of 37 cm to determine the guidance efficiency and behavior of yearling shortnose and pallid sturgeon to two guidance structures, a bar rack and a louver array. We tested one vertical bar rack configuration with slats spaced 3. 9 cm apart (clear spacing). The bar rack slats were oriented directly into the approach flow, and the row of slats was oriented at a 45 ° angle to the flow.

Louver slats were oriented at a 90 ° angle to the flow, and the row of slats was oriented at a 20 ° angle to the approach flow. Mean approach velocity to both structures was 31 - 34 cm/s. Eighteen <b>shortnose</b> <b>sturgeon</b> tagged with passive integrated transponders were tested once in each configuration; 24 - 38 pallid sturgeon were tested in each configuration. <b>Shortnose</b> <b>sturgeon</b> showed some behavioral differences due to experience with the bar rack, but experience {{did not affect the}} percent guided.
