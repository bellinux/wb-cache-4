5|$|There was <b>still</b> <b>at</b> {{this time}} no common {{agreement}} {{on the way to}} present plant names so they ranged in length from one word to lengthy descriptive sentences. As the number of recorded plants increased this naming system became more unwieldy.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 19 and <b>still</b> <b>at</b> The Scots College, Arthur {{applied to}} join the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). He enlisted on 4September 1939, the day after Australia's entry into World WarII. Training at RAAF Station Point Cook, Victoria, and RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, he was {{commissioned}} a pilot officer on 30March 1940, despite being prone to airsickness early on. He served initially with No.22 (City of Sydney) Squadron at Richmond, operating Hawker Demons and Avro Ansons.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of summer, Philip and his fleet left Macedon, sailed through the Euripus Strait, between the island of Euboea and Boeotia on the Greek mainland, and then rounded Cape Malea, before dropping anchor off the Islands of Cephalenia and Leucas, to await word of {{the location of the}} Roman fleet. Informed that it was <b>still</b> <b>at</b> Lilybaeum, he sailed north to Apollonia in Illyria.|$|E
50|$|<b>A.T.</b> <b>Still</b> University School of Osteopathic Medicine in Arizona (ATSU-SOMA) is an osteopathic {{medical school}} in the United States {{granting}} the Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree.

50|$|Peter Tork was {{recommended}} to Rafelson and Schneider by friend Stephen <b>Stills</b> <b>at</b> his own audition. Tork, a skilled multi-instrumentalist, had performed at various Greenwich Village folk clubs before moving west, {{where he worked}} as a busboy.|$|R
5|$|Atlantic puffins are {{probably}} safest when out at sea. Here, the dangers are often from below the water rather than above, and puffins {{can sometimes be}} seen putting their heads underwater to peer around for predators. Seals {{have been known to}} kill puffins and large fish may also do so. Most puffin colonies are on small islands, and this is no coincidence as it avoids predation by ground-based mammals such as foxes, rats, stoats and weasels, cats and dogs. When they come ashore, the birds are <b>still</b> <b>at</b> risk and the main threats come from the sky.|$|E
5|$|Born in Coalinga, California, Stafford {{made her}} first musical {{appearance}} at age twelve. While <b>still</b> <b>at</b> high school she joined her two older sisters {{to form a}} vocal trio named The Stafford Sisters, who found moderate success on radio and in film. In 1938, while the sisters {{were part of the}} cast of Twentieth Century Fox's production of Alexander's Ragtime Band, Stafford met the future members of The Pied Pipers and became the group's lead singer. Bandleader Tommy Dorsey hired them in 1939 to perform back-up vocals for his orchestra.|$|E
5|$|Convection shifted {{towards the}} eastern {{semicircle}} of the circulation, while the still-exposed center became malformed and elongated. On September14, the poorly organized cyclone crossed southeastern Louisiana, turned towards the north-northeast {{and made a}} second landfall close to the AlabamaMississippi border at 1500UTC that day, <b>still</b> <b>at</b> its peak strength. The storm dissipated rapidly as it proceeded inland, and the remnant low pressure area moved into Georgia and South Carolina.|$|E

50|$|The <b>stills</b> <b>at</b> Banff {{were fed}} by hand with coal until 1963, when a system {{was put in}} place to deliver the coal mechanically. In 1970, the stills were {{converted}} to be heated by oil burners. Cooling water was drawn from Burn of Boydine.|$|R

5|$|Ecuador is <b>still</b> <b>at</b> {{risk from}} earthquakes: Both intraplate (such {{as those in}} March 1987) and {{interplate}} earthquakes are possible. Intraplate seismicity poses a more formidable threat, {{as it can be}} much more powerful than interplate seismicity and is usually associated with landslides, subsidence, and even soil liquefaction.|$|E
5|$|Finally, in mid-August, the {{fighting}} on Borneo {{came to an}} end following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the subsequent surrender of Japan. After this the 2/9th Battalion carried out various garrison duties such as guarding prisoners of war and maintaining internal security while the demobilisation process took place. As personnel were repatriated back to Australia or transferred to other units for further service, the battalion's strength dropped until it was finally disbanded on 3 January 1946 while <b>still</b> <b>at</b> Balikpapan.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{are called}} in to investigate, as the victim's {{description}} seems {{similar to those of}} other victims of a lonely hearts killer <b>still</b> <b>at</b> large. Scully attempts to perform an autopsy on Lauren's body, only to find that it has liquified with only a skeleton remaining. Scully later discerns that the substance coating the body was a concentrated digestive enzyme, and that the remains are lacking in body fat.|$|E

5|$|Gert {{continued}} to move northwest after becoming a tropical storm, and reached a peak intensity of 45mph (70km/h) and a minimum central pressure of 1005mbar (29.68inHg). Gert made landfall just 6miles (10km) {{to the southeast}} of Pánuco, <b>still</b> <b>at</b> peak intensity, at 10:00p.m. CDT (0000 July 25, UTC). However, due to its interaction with land, the storm quickly weakened back to a tropical depression strength early on July 25, and became a remnant low twelve hours after that. Six hours later, just a day after it made landfall, it dissipated over the mountains of central Mexico.|$|E
5|$|He {{was born}} in Temple Fortune, which was then a new suburb on the {{north-western}} edge of London. His father {{died when he was}} two years old, after the family had moved to Southend-on-Sea, Essex. His mother then moved with him to Brighton, Sussex, where they lived with her parents above a shop. Merrifield's archaeological career began in 1930 when, although <b>still</b> <b>at</b> school, he was taken on as an assistant to the curator of Brighton Museum, H. S. Toms. While working there, in 1935, he gained an external degree in anthropology from the University of London.|$|E

5|$|Hubbard's first {{military}} service {{was with the}} Montana Army National Guard, which he joined {{at the age of}} 16 in October 1927 while <b>still</b> <b>at</b> school, falsely stating that his age was 18. Enlisting at the State Armory in his home town of Helena, Montana, he served as a private in the Headquarters Company of 163rd Infantry. In May 1930, at the age of 19, he joined the Marine Corps Reserve 20th Regiment, a training unit connected with George Washington University where he was a student from 1930–32.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, Eichelberger {{became the}} Superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point. He instituted {{a number of}} reforms, cutting back {{activities}} such as horseback riding and close order drill, and substituting modern combat training, in which cadets participated in military exercises alongside National Guard units. He acquired Stewart Field as a training facility, which gave cadets a chance to qualify as pilots while <b>still</b> <b>at</b> West Point. He became commander of the 77th Infantry Division in March 1942, and I Corps in June.|$|E
5|$|In some units the {{alternator}} {{is essentially}} the same as that used in portable generating sets used to supply mains power, modified to produce a higher current at a lower voltage but <b>still</b> <b>at</b> the 50 or 60Hz grid frequency. In higher-quality units an alternator with more poles is used and supplies current at a higher frequency, such as 400Hz. The smaller amount of time the high-frequency waveform spends near zero makes it much easier to strike and maintain a stable arc than with the cheaper grid-frequency sets or grid-frequency mains-powered units.|$|E
