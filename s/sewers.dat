5|$|Brick <b>sewers</b> {{had been}} built in London from the 17th century when {{sections}} of the Fleet and Walbrook rivers were covered for that purpose. In the century preceding 1856, over a hundred <b>sewers</b> were constructed in London, and at that date the city had around 200,000 cesspits and 360 <b>sewers.</b> Some cesspits leaked methane and other gases, which often caught fire and exploded, leading to loss of life, {{while many of the}} <b>sewers</b> were in a poor state of repair. During the early 19th century improvements had been undertaken in the supply of water to Londoners, and by 1858 many of the city's medieval wooden water pipes were being replaced with iron ones. This, combined with the introduction of flushing toilets and the rising of the city's population from just under one million to three million, led to more water being flushed into the <b>sewers,</b> along with the associated effluent. The outfalls from factories, slaughterhouses and other industrial activities put further strain on the already failing system. Much of this outflow either overflowed, or discharged directly, into the Thames.|$|E
5|$|In {{parallel}} {{with the construction of}} the works, trunk <b>sewers</b> were built to convey sewage from the city to the works. These was a major programme of expansion to the sewer network in 1910, to ensure that it could cope with the expected volumes of effluent produced. Because British <b>sewers</b> are also expected to handle rainwater, a series of storm sewage overflows were provided, which resulted in diluted sewage being discharged into the River Don in times of heavy rainfall.|$|E
5|$|The smell, and people's {{fears of}} its {{possible}} effects, prompted {{action from the}} local and national administrators who had been considering possible solutions for the problem. The authorities accepted a proposal from the civil engineer Joseph Bazalgette to move the effluent eastwards along a series of interconnecting <b>sewers</b> that sloped towards outfalls beyond the metropolitan area. Work on high-, mid- and low-level systems for the new Northern and Southern Outfall <b>Sewers</b> started {{at the beginning of}} 1859 and lasted until 1875. To aid the drainage, pumping stations were placed to lift the sewage from lower levels into higher pipes. Two of the more ornate stations, Abbey Mills in Stratford and Crossness on the Erith Marshes, are listed for protection by English Heritage. Bazalgette's plan introduced the three embankments to London in which the <b>sewers</b> ran—the Victoria, Chelsea and Albert Embankments.|$|E

50|$|CSOs {{should not}} be {{confused}} with sanitary <b>sewer</b> overflows. Sanitary <b>sewer</b> overflows are caused by <b>sewer</b> system obstructions, damage, or flows in excess of <b>sewer</b> capacity (rather than treatment plant capacity.) Sanitary <b>sewer</b> overflows may occur at any low spot in the <b>sewer</b> system rather than at the CSO relief structures. Absence of a diversion outfall often causes sanitary <b>sewer</b> overflows to flood residential structures and/or flow over traveled road surfaces before reaching natural drainage channels. Sanitary <b>sewer</b> overflows may cause greater health risks and environmental damage than CSOs if they occur during dry weather when there is no precipitation runoff to dilute and flush away sewage pollutants.|$|R

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 19th century the Glastonbury Canal {{drainage}} problems and competition from the new railways caused a decline in trade, and the town's economy became depressed. The canal was closed on 1 July 1854, and the lock and aqueducts on the upper section were dismantled. The railway opened on 17 August 1854. The lower sections of the canal were given to the Commissioners for <b>Sewers,</b> for use as a drainage ditch.

5|$|Responsibility for {{the river}} has resided {{with a number of}} legal bodies in the past. The first was the Rother Levels Commissioners of <b>Sewers,</b> who were {{established}} by letters patent issued under the provisions of the Statute of <b>Sewers</b> dated 1531. The lower river was also covered by the Rye Harbour Commissioners, after they were established by Act of Parliament in 1731. In 1872, the Board of Conservators for the River Rother was created to manage and protect stocks of fish in the river. As in many parts of Britain, the rights and duties of these various bodies competed and overlapped, and by the early twentieth century, the situation was chaotic. An attempt to resolve the confusion was made in 1930, with the passing of the Land Drainage Act 1930, under which 47 catchment areas were established, and a Catchment Board was then created for each one, with overall responsibility for that area. Thus the Rother and Jury's Gut Catchment Board was created. While the board had overall responsibility, local management of rivers and drainage was under the control of Internal Drainage Boards, and the transition was eased by reconstituting Commissioners of <b>Sewers</b> as Internal Drainage Boards, {{under the terms of the}} act.|$|E

In this paper, significant emissions in commonly applied <b>sewer</b> systems (combined <b>sewer</b> system [CSS], separate <b>sewer</b> system [SSS]) are mentioned, and typical concentration ranges of SS are listed. Furthermore, data from selected pollutants (lead, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [PAH]) are collected and concentration ranges in typical flow types of the <b>sewer</b> systems are calculated.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Collection of {{wastewater}} {{is considered}} one of the major environmental problems in Egypt. More than 50 % of Egypt villages have no facilities of wastewater collection. Small bore <b>sewer</b> system is a good alternative for wastewater collection system especially in rural areas because the construction cost of small bore <b>sewer</b> system is cheaper than that of conventional <b>sewer</b> system. However, detailed analysis is required to determine the optimum conditions at which small bore <b>sewer</b> system will be a better choice. This paper aims to provide an estimation of total costs for both small bore <b>sewer</b> systems and conventional <b>sewer</b> systems using data of eight different villages in rural areas in Egypt. The villages were chosen in Menofyia and Assuit governorates. Two equations were obtained that can be used to obtain the total costs of both small bore <b>sewer</b> systems and conventional <b>sewer</b> systems for rural areas of similar characteristics to those studied. The optimum population values, at which the small bore <b>sewer</b> system will be the best alternative, were obtained. Index Terms — Collection systems; Conventional <b>sewer</b> system...|$|R

5|$|Access to {{improved}} sanitation is also universal, either through <b>sewers</b> or on-site sanitation. All collected waste water is treated at secondary-level treatment plants. All effluents discharged to closed or semi-closed water bodies, such as Tokyo Bay, Osaka Bay, or Lake Biwa, are further treated to tertiary level. This applies to about 15% of waste water. The effluent quality is remarkably good at 3–10mg/l of BOD for secondary-level treatment, {{well below the}} national effluent standard of 20mg/l.|$|E
