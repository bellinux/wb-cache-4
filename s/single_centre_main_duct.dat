40|$|Objective To {{review the}} {{perinatal}} outcome of monochorionic twin pregnancies treated by fetoscopic laser coagulation for twin-twin transfusion syndrome. Design Retrospective study. Setting A university teaching hospital in Hong Kong. Patients Thirty consecutive cases of fetoscopic laser coagulation of placental anastomoses for twin-twin transfusion syndrome {{performed in a}} <b>single</b> <b>centre.</b> <b>Main</b> outcome measures Operative complications and perinatal survival rates. Results The median gestational age at initial presentation, laser photocoagulation, and delivery were 22 (range, 16 - 27) weeks, 23 (18 - 28) weeks, and 32 (21 - 37) weeks, respectively. To improve the visualisation, in three cases amnio-exchange was undertaken; the procedure was abandoned in two due to poor visualisation. The overall fetal survival rate, the double infant survival rate, and survival rate {{for at least one}} twin were 72 % (43 / 60), 60 % (18 / 30), and 83 % (25 / 30), respectively. The most common peri-operative complication was bleeding from the uterine wall into the amniotic cavity, which affected three (10 %) patients. Conclusions Our results of fetoscopic laser surgery for twin-twin transfusion syndrome were similar to those in specialised centres in other countries.

40|$|Objective: Infliximab is a human/mouse {{chimeric}} anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -a antibody that {{is effective}} {{in the management of}} psoriasis. Anti-TNF treatments may reactivate latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI); therefore, screening for LTBI is mandatory before starting any anti-TNF-a therapy. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the usefulness of the QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) test in psoriatic patients under treatment with infliximab. Research design and methods: A retrospective study had been performed on patients affected by psoriasis who had been treated with infliximab from 2003 to 2012 at a <b>single</b> <b>centre.</b> <b>Main</b> outcomes measures: QFT-G was tested by a standard TB enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, based on detection of interferon-g release from sensitized leucocytes exposed to the synthetic Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigens at baseline and every 6 months until the end of treatment. Results: A total of 140 patients were included. At baseline, 7 QFT-G tests were positive and 133 tests were negative. Of the 133 patients, 11 (8 %) who were negative at baseline became QFT-G test positive during treatment. Of those 11 patients, 5 had a reversion during treatment. Of the 133 patients, 122 (92 %) who were negative at baseline remained negative. Conclusions: It was found that the development of positive QFT-G tests, observed in 8 % treated with infliximab, was not associated with pulmonary or extra-pulmonary tuberculosis...|$|R
50|$|Downstream {{of the air}} handler, {{the supply}} air trunk duct will {{commonly}} fork, providing air to many individual air outlets such as diffusers, grilles, and registers.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{digestive}} diverticula of the Anisomyaria and Eulamellibranchia revealed certain features hitherto undescribed. The diverticula consist of blind-ending tubules which open into ciliated <b>main</b> <b>ducts</b> by way of short, non-ciliated secondary <b>ducts.</b> The <b>main</b> <b>ducts</b> open into the intestinal groove. In all the species examined the ciliated epithelium of the <b>main</b> <b>ducts</b> was restricted to a well-defined groove, the re-mainder of the lumen being surrounded by a non-ciliated, brush-border epithelium. Each tubule {{is surrounded by a}} system of smooth muscle fibres. Cilia associated with the darkly staining cells of the crypts were demonstrated in sections of the tubules. After feeding with titanium dioxide in suspension, this substance was later found in the large vacuolated cells of the tubules. The particles of titanium dioxide were larger than o-i^t. A continuous circulation is maintained within the <b>main</b> <b>ducts</b> solely as a result of ciliary activity. The exhalant current in the ciliated portion of the <b>main</b> <b>ducts</b> produces an inhalant counterpart current in the non-ciliated portion. It is suggested that fresh fluid is drawn into the tubules {{as a consequence of the}} absorptive functions of the large vacuolated cells. Indigestible material accumulates in the large vacuolated cells and is extruded into the <b>main</b> <b>ducts</b> where it is conveyed out of the diverticula by the exhalant ciliary current. In both the Anisomyaria and Eulamellibranchia the flap-like major typhlosole prevents material entering the mid-gut except by the intestinal groove, and isolates the rejectory currents of the intestinal groove from the general circulation of particles in the stomach. In the Eulamellibranchia the major typhlosole also acts as a valve which controls the entry and exit of material into and out of the inhalant and exhalant portions of the <b>main</b> <b>ducts...</b>|$|R

To {{analyze the}} role of {{different}} procedures {{in the management of}} pancreatic stump according to the incidence of postoperative morbidity derived from the data of a single center surgical population. Methods. From 1989 to 2005 we performed 76 pancreaticoduodenectomies (PD) and 26 distal panereatectomies (DP). The surgical reconstruction after PD was as follows: 11 manual non-absorbable stitches closure of the <b>main</b> <b>duct,</b> 24 closures of the <b>main</b> <b>duct</b> with linear stapler, 17 occlusions of the <b>main</b> <b>duct</b> with neoprene glue and 24 duct-to-mucosa anastomosis. Results. In the PD group, the morbidity rate was 60 %, caused by: pancreatic leakage in 48 % of patients, hemorrhagic complications in 10 % following surgical procedure and infectious complications in 15 %. After DP we recorded: leakage in 3. 9 %, haemoperitoneum in 15. 4 % and no complications in 80. 7 %. The multivariate analysis showed that the in-hospital mortality was linked to the surgical procedure (PD, p= 0. 003) and to the following complications: pancreatic leakage (p= 0. 004), haemoperitoneum (p= 0. 00045) and infectious complications (p= 0. 0077).

40|$|Introduction. The {{variations}} in methods of pancreatic stump {{management and the}} volume of literature available on both <b>main</b> pancreatic <b>duct</b> and pancreaticoenctric anastomosis leak indicates the concern associated with the leak and the continuing efforts to prevent it. Herein we analyzed the role of pancreatic leakage followed by pancreatic surgery on the incidence of postoperative morbidity. Patients and methods. From 1989 to 2005, we performed 76 pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) and 26 distal pancreatectomy (DP), assumed as control case). During DP the parenchymal transection was performed with a linear stapler. The surgical reconstruction after PD was as follows: 11 manual nonabsorbable stitch closure of the <b>main</b> <b>duct,</b> 24 closure of the <b>main</b> <b>duct</b> with linear stapler, 17 temporary occlusion of the <b>main</b> <b>duct</b> with neoprene glue, and 24 duct-to-mucosa anastomosis. Results. In the PD group, morbidity rate was 60 %, caused by pancreatic leakage, with an incidence of 48 %, hemorrhagic complication, occurred in 10 % of patients following surgical procedure and infectious complication, with an incidence of 15 %. After distal pancreatectomy we recorded 80, 7 % no complications, 3, 9 % leakage, 15, 4 % hemoperitoneum. By multivariate analysis bleeding complications, biliary anastomosis leakage, and infectious complications were consequences of pancreatic leakage (P = 0. 025, P = 0. 025, and P = 0. 025, respectively). A significant statistical difference was recorded analyzing re-operation rates between closure of the <b>main</b> <b>duct</b> with linear stapler versus temporary occlusion of the <b>main</b> <b>duct</b> with neoprene glue (t = 0. 049) and closure of the <b>main</b> <b>duct</b> with linear stapler versus duct-to-mucosa anastomosis (t = 0. 003). Conclusions. On the ground of our results of bleeding complication, biliary anastomosis leakage and infectious complication were consequences of pancreatic leakage: failure of a surgical anastomosis has serious consequences, particularly in case of anastomosis of the pancreas to the small bowel,, because of the digestive capacities of activated pancreatic secretions.

40|$|Numerical and {{experimental}} studies were undertaken {{to characterize the}} noise transmission and scattering properties in higher-order modes across the tee-junction of a rectangular duct used in ventilation and air-conditioning systems. To measure these properties, a formulation of a transmission matrix based on the transfer function and a two-microphone method was devised. The measurement of modal sound transmission and scattering coefficients is demonstrated for a duct element in a rectangular duct. The results of numerical simulations were verified by experiments. The results show that sound transmissions of fundamental mode and higher-order modes across the <b>main</b> <b>duct</b> are high at the eigen-frequencies of the <b>main</b> <b>duct</b> and sidebranch. Weak modal coupling of the branch-modes and the traveling wave in the <b>main</b> <b>duct</b> is observed at or {{very close to the}} eigen-frequencies of the sidebranch, which shifts excitation of the higher-order branch-modes at higher frequencies. A decrease in sound transmission and increase in sound scattering into higher-order modes occur with excitation of the axial branch-mode.

The long-type accessory pancreatic duct forms a straight line and joins the <b>main</b> pancreatic <b>duct</b> at the neck portion of the pancreas. The short-type accessory pancreatic <b>duct</b> joins the <b>main</b> pancreatic <b>duct</b> near its first inferior branch.

40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} aimed to compare two-dimen-sional (2 D) and {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) {{for the assessment}} of pancreatic cystic lesions. Between February 2009 and December 2011, 35 patients that had been diagnosed with pancreatic cystic lesions, which was confirmed by surgery and pathology, underwent pre-operative 2 D or 3 D MRCP for pre-operative evaluation. In the present study, the quality of these 2 D and 3 D MRCP images, the visualization of the features of the cystic lesions, visualization of the pancreatic <b>main</b> <b>duct</b> and prediction of ductal communication with the cystic lesions were evaluated and compared using statistical software. The 3 D MRCP images were determined to be of higher quality compared with the 2 D MRCP images. The features of the cystic lesions were visualized better on 3 D MRCP compared with 2 D MRCP. The same capability for the visualization of the segment of the pancreatic <b>main</b> <b>duct</b> was exhibited by 3 D and 2 D MRCP.

40|$|Three {{distinct}} entities among non-inflammatory cystic lesions of the pancreas have been defined: intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), serous cystic neoplasm (SCN) and mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN). IPMN {{is characterized by}} intraductal papillary growth and thick mucus secretion: its incidence has dramatically increased since its initial description. These lesions probably can progress towards invasive carcinoma. IPMNs are symptomatic in most cases: the typical presentation is a recurrent acute pancreatitis, without evident cause, of low or moderate severity. The diagnosis is usually based upon the imaging (CT/cholangio-MRI) demonstrating a pancreatic cystic mass, involving a dilated <b>main</b> <b>duct,</b> eventually associated to some filling defects, or a normal Wirsung duct communicating with the cyst lesion. Surgical treatment is generally indicated for <b>main</b> <b>duct</b> IPMN and branch duct IPMN with suspected malignancy (tumour size ≥ 30 mm, mural nodules, dilated <b>main</b> pancreatic <b>duct,</b> or positive cytology) or prominent symptoms.

Of particular interest was the finding that the lateral prostate consists of two different ductal zones: (1) lateral type 1 prostate with 5 - 7 long <b>main</b> <b>ducts</b> (resembling miniature palm trees) that extend cranially towards both the seminal vesicle and dorsal prostate to arborize near the bladder neck, and (2) lateral type 2 prostate with 5 - 6 short <b>main</b> <b>ducts</b> that arborize caudal to the bladder neck and give rise to compact bushy glands. Both lateral prostatic groups had a ductal-acinar organization. The adult structure of the other rat prostatic lobes was also ex-amined, and closely resembled their mouse counterparts. The ventral prostate, which had 2 - 3 paIrs of slender <b>main</b> <b>ducts</b> per side, and the coagulating gland, which had 1 <b>main</b> <b>duct</b> per side, was completely ductal in structure.

METHODS: Multicentre, retrospective analysis of prospectively enrolled patients, with resectable Sendai-positive, not-operated intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. Overall-survival and disease-specific survival were the primary end-point, and progression-free survival secondary. RESULTS: Thirty-five patients (60 % male, median age 77) enrolled: 40 % main-duct, 60 % branch-duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms. In 19 patients surgery was ruled out due to comorbidities, in 7 because aged> 80, 9 refused surgery. Twelve (34. 3 %) patients died after a mean of 32. 5 months, 8 due to disease progression, 4 due to comorbidities. The median overall, disease-specific and progression-free survival were 52, 55, and 44 months respectively. <b>Main</b> <b>duct</b> involvement and age at diagnosis were associated with worse overall and progression-free survival, only <b>main</b> <b>duct</b> involvement with worse disease-specific survival (52 months <b>main</b> <b>duct</b> vs. 64 branch duct; P= 0. 04). CONCLUSION: These results suggest that in elderly and comorbid patients with Sendai-positive intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms, especially of the branch duct, a conservative approach could be reasonable, as associated with a relatively good outcome, and should be carefully discussed with the patients...|$|R

Pancreatic intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) rank among the most common cystic tumors of the pancreas. For a long time they were misdiagnosed as mucinous cystadenocarcinoma, ductal adenocarcinoma in situ, or chronic pancreatitis. Only in recent years have IPMNs been fully recognized as clinical and pathological entities, although their origin and molecular pathogenesis remain poorly understood. IPMNs are precursors of inva-sive carcinomas. When resected in a preinvasive state pa-tient prognosis is excellent, and even when they are already invasive, patient prognosis is more favorable than with ductal adenocarcinomas. Subdivision into macroscopic and microscopic subtypes facilitates further patient risk stratification and directly impacts treatment. There are <b>main</b> <b>duct</b> and branch duct IPMNs, with the <b>main</b> <b>duct</b> type including the intestinal, pancreatobiliary, and onco-cytic types and the branch duct type solely harboring the gastric type. Whereas <b>main</b> <b>duct</b> IPMNs have a high risk for malignant progression, demanding their resection, branch duct IPMNs have a much lower risk for harboring malignancy. Patients with small branch duct/gastric-type IPMNs (< 2 cm) without symptoms or mural nodules can be managed by periodic surveillance. The Oncologist 2010...|$|R
