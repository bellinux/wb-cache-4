5000|$|Engines of Britain's Great Western Railway carried two whistles, one low- and one high-pitched. The high-pitched whistle was for {{warning of}} the trains {{approach}} and for giving shunting signals. The low-pitched whistle was for sending braking instructions to the crew on the train {{before the advent of}} continuous brakes and was retained for the same purpose for goods operations. Some whistle-signals required use of both whistles. Some Great Western [...] "autocoaches"—from where the driver operated the <b>steam</b> engine's <b>regulator</b> and brakes, when the engine was propelling one or more autocoaches—still had a whistle connection with the engine's brake whistle, although a gong (much like a tram gong) was fitted at the front of each autocoach and was operated by the driver using a foot treadle.|$|R
50|$|An M.L.S. multiple-valve {{regulator}} superheater header was fitted, {{arranged with}} the regulator valves located on its saturated <b>steam</b> side.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{transients}} which {{are expected to}} occur with moderate frequency, and which involve an unplanned increase in heat removal by the secondary system, are covered by this SRP section. Excessive heat removal, i. e., a heat removal rate {{in excess of the}} heat generation rate in the core, causes a decrease in moderator temperature which increases core reactivity and can lead to a power level increase and a decrease in shutdown margin. The power level increase will lead to a reactor trip. Any unplanned power level increase may result in fuel damage or excessive reactor system pressure. Each of the transients covered by this SRP section should be discussed in individual sections of the safety analysis report (SAR), as required by the Standard Format (Ref. 1). The transients to be evaluated include: 1. Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs) and Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs) a. Feedwater system malfunctions that result in a decrease in feedwater temperature. b. Feedwater system malfunctions that result in an increase in feedwater flow. c. <b>Steam</b> pressure <b>regulator</b> malfunctions or failures that result in increased steam flow...|$|R
50|$|The Trofimoff valve {{comprises}} the valve spindle, the piston valve heads slotted onto {{them and the}} two supporting plates (Stützplatten). When the engine is running under load the valve heads are forced by steam pressure onto the support plates and work like standard pistons (Regelkolbenschieber). If steam admission ceases or, on a <b>steam</b> locomotive, the <b>regulator</b> is closed, the pressure drops, the valve heads remain in the inside dead centre position near {{the centre of the}} cylinder due to the tension of the piston rings. The valve spindle continues to move backwards and forwards with the support plates attached to it, without disturbing the valve heads. In this way, perfect pressure balance is achieved, thus ensuring excellent light-running conditions for the steam engine or locomotive.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: One of {{the basic}} {{engineering}} problems of the automatic control systems synthesis for steam turbines is systems quality indices optimization task. The features of such task are defined by plenty of control systems structural parameters, complication of quality indices formalization and calculation, the systems models high order. The greatest difficulty of the control system synthesis is optimization models and methods design. The paper purpose is to develop models and methods for optimum design of the intelligent automatic control systems of atomic power station steam turbine using genetic algorithms. The steam turbine automatic control system is applied to stabilize turbine rotor frequency with high precision. The intelligent steam turbine control system includes a steam turbine, frequency sensor, intelligent frequency regulator, electro-hydraulic automatic drive and turbine adjusting valve. Input signals on an automatic drive can be given by the <b>steam</b> pressure <b>regulator</b> through the turbine management mechanism or by the electric power regulator. Assumptions substantiated to model the automatic control system and automatic drive as executive link of control system. The automatic drive diagram of principle includes electro-hydraulic transformer, sleeve valve, servomotor, position sensors and electronic part. In the paper were built the mathematical models of automatic drive and steam turbine, the models permanent parameters values were calculated, the mathematical models of the automatic control system were developed in state space with the intelligent frequency regulator, the regulator parameters were optimized with system quality indices using genetic algorithms...|$|R

40|$|Various {{types of}} {{equipment}} malfunctions, operator errors, and abnormal occurrences {{that may occur}} with moderate frequency can cause an unplanned increase in reactor coolant inventory. Depending on the boron concentration and temperature of the injected water and {{the response of the}} automatic control systems, a power level increase may result and lead to fuel damage or over-pressurization of the reactor coolant system. Alternatively, a power level decrease and depressurization may result. The reactor will trip from high water level, high flux, or high or low pressure. This SRP section is intended to be applicable to these types of moderate frequency events that increase reactor coolant inventory. These transients should be discussed in individual sections of the'applicant's safety analysis report (SAR), as required by the Standard Format (Ref. 1). The specific initiating events considered in this SRP section are: 1. Boiling water reactors (BWRs) [...] Inadvertent operation of the high pressure core spray, high pressure coolant Injection, or reactor core isolation cooling system. 2. PWRs [...] Inadvertent operation of high pressure emergency core cooling system (high pressure injection system) or a malfunction of the chemical and volume control system. Other BWR transients that can result in an increase in reactor coolant inventory include feedwater system malfunctions (increasing flow), <b>steam</b> pressure <b>regulator</b> malfunctions (decreasing flow), loss of electrical load, turbine trip, main steam isolation valve (MSIV) closure, and loss of condenser vacuum.

30|$|In the {{combined}} treatment, SHS is {{generated in the}} reactor by boiling the injected distilled water [15]. The procedures for {{the combined}} treatment are as follows: after the reactor, with 10 pieces of stacked lumber, is made airtight, some distilled water is injected into the reactor. The amount of distilled water depends on a specific volume of SHS at the target temperature and target pressure and the volume capacity of the reactor. In this study, the target temperature of the SHS was set to 250  °C, {{the temperature of the}} lumber reached 220  °C at this SHS temperature, and the target pressure of the SHS was set to 0.5  MPa (absolute pressure). In this condition, the specific volume of SHS is 474  L/kg and the volume capacity of the reactor is 700  L. Therefore, the amount of distilled water to be injected into the reactor is calculated as 1.5  kg. Nevertheless, to fill up the reactor with steam quickly {{at the beginning of the}} process, a larger amount was necessary. After injecting 3  kg of distilled water, the air in the reactor was removed. When the absolute pressure was dropped to below 0.01  MPa, the heater was operated to boil the water in the reactor. By evaporating the water in the reactor, the pressure in the reactor and the temperature of the steam were increased, and the reactor was then filled with SHS. The temperature of the SHS was maintained by the On/Off system of the heater, which was shut off when the temperature of the SHS reached the target temperature, and was the system re-operated when the temperature of the SHS dropped to below the target temperature. In addition, the pressure of the SHS was maintained while drawing off excess <b>steam</b> through <b>regulators</b> when the <b>steam</b> pressure reached the target pressure. The operation time of the heater was 18  h. The total oven dry weight of the lumber used in the combined treatment was estimated to be 81.0  kg.|$|R
5000|$|The {{driver of}} the lead {{locomotive}} on the Bendigo train {{had been working for}} 12 hours and 25 minutes {{at the time of the}} accident. He stated that the brakes had been working satisfactorily as far as St. Albans, the prior station. He applied the brakes gently upon passing the distant signal; about 200 m from the Home signal, however, [...] "the train shot me forward as though the brakes had come off" [...] and [...] "the train appeared to run into the engine". Realising that his train was not going to stop prior to reaching the Home signal, the driver put the locomotive into reverse and opened the <b>steam</b> <b>regulator</b> to apply as much power as possible.|$|E
50|$|The {{main steam}} {{cylinders}} {{were also used}} as brakes on the rack section. During descents, the 32 Tonner would be put into reverse with the <b>steam</b> <b>regulator</b> closed and a three-way valve in the exhaust pipe under the smokebox would be closed when brake power was required. The exhaust passages would then be isolated from the blast pipe and air would be admitted to the steam chests. The air would enter the cylinders though the exhaust ports and therefore reversed operations in the cylinders. Used air would be exhausted through the steam inlet ports back into the steam pipe, from where it was led {{to the rear of}} the engine by a 1+1/2 in branch pipe. This branch pipe had another valve, by which the driver could regulate the amount of compression in the cylinders. Small amounts of water could be admitted into the cylinders to keep them cool.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. A partially-automated {{parboiling}} unit (PU) {{that can}} process approximately 2 kg of rough rice per cycle was recently developed and is described. The system components include {{a stainless steel}} tank (40 -cm long; 20 -cm internal diameter), a water-circulation pump, a hot-water supply tank, a <b>steam</b> <b>regulator,</b> four cylindrical sample containers, and a computer interface. The processing performance of the PU was evaluated using rough rice of the long-grain cultivar CL 151 obtained from two growing locations. Sample size and location of the sample containers in the tank were the vari-ables considered in the performance tests. The processing conditions were: soaking at 70 °C and 138 kPag (20 psig) for 2 h; steaming at 120 °C and 69 kPag (10 psig) for 10 min; and gentle drying at 26 °C and 65 % relative humidity until a mois-ture content of ~ 12 % was attained. The quality attributes of the parboiled product were compared with those obtained by a laboratory-scale parboiling procedure that employed autoclave steaming. Differences {{in the percentage of}} deformed kernels were observed due to the effect of sample size and location of the sample containers in the tank. Milling yields and milled kernel color were minimally affected. In general, the quality attributes of parboiled rice obtained by the PU were either similar or better than those of the product obtained by autoclave steaming. Automated process operations (soaking, draining, and steaming), small sample size requirements, and good reproducibility are some key features that make the PU a valuable tool for rice parboiling and general processing research...|$|E
