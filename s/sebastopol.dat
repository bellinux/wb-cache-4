25|$|<b>Sebastopol</b> meadowfoam {{habitat is}} {{threatened}} {{by a number of}} human activities, particularly urbanization spreading out from nearby cities Santa Rosa, Rohnert Park and Cotati. In spring 2005, a controversy erupted when the plant was reported at the site of a proposed commercial/residential development project within the boundary of the City of <b>Sebastopol</b> known as Laguna Vista. State wildlife officials concluded that the meadowfoam had been deliberately transplanted from elsewhere, presumably to block the development project, and ordered the plants to be dug up. Opponents of the project disagreed and have presented testimony from experts who argue that the state used incomplete analysis to arrive at its finding. In spring 2006, the plants reappeared, although officials said they had likely sprouted from seeds scattered the previous year. Sebastopol's city council has yet to make a final decision regarding the Laguna Vista project.|$|E
25|$|This {{species is}} only known from {{approximately}} 30 {{locations in the}} laguna de Santa Rosa and southern Cotati Valley of Sonoma County, in these areas it occurs in wet meadows and around vernal pools at elevations of under 300 meters.

25|$|L. Vinculans {{was listed}} as a U.S. federally {{endangered}} species on December 2, 1991. The state of California and U.S. Government are working closely with Sonoma County and the cities of <b>Sebastopol</b> and Santa Rosa to analyze land development proposals in areas of potential habitat, with a goal of disapproving such projects or requiring appropriate In situ or Ex-situ conservation. The primary proactive form of protection is through the regional vernal pool conservation and restoration program.|$|E
25|$|Ballarat {{has four}} State Government-operated {{secondary}} schools of which Ballarat High School (established in 1907) is the oldest.

Ballarat Secondary College was formed in 1994 by the amalgamation of Ballarat East Secondary College, Wendouree Secondary College and Midlands Secondary College. Phoenix College was formed in 2012 as an amalgamation of <b>Sebastopol</b> College and Redan Primary School.|$|E
25|$|After 1827 {{there were}} no major battles until 1914. The navy was used against shore installations, {{such as those in}} the Baltic and Black Sea in 1854 and 1855, to fight pirates; to hunt down slave ships; and to assist the army when sailors and marines were landed as naval brigades, as on many {{occasions}} between the siege of <b>Sebastopol</b> and the 1900 Boxer Rebellion. With a fleet larger than any two rivals combined, the British nation could take security for granted, but at all times the national leaders and public opinion supported a powerful navy, and service was of high prestige.|$|E
25|$|Taylor was {{commissioned}} as an ensign into the British Army's 79th Foot on 11 December 1835. On 29 March 1839 {{he was promoted}} Lieutenant and on 23 August 1844 Captain.

He commanded a brigade in Oude from November 1858 to January 1859. In 1860 he joined the General Staff in England, then held a variety of posts, in the course of which he was promoted major general on 6 March 1868, lieutenant general on 23 August 1877, and finally general on 30 January 1880.|$|E
25|$|Unlike Melbourne, Ballarat {{does not}} have a defined urban growth boundary. This has put {{continuing}} pressure on the city council to approve development applications for subdivisions outside of the city fringe. In response to lobbying by landholders, the Ballarat West Growth Area Plan, a major greenfield land development plan, was prepared and has approved by the city and state government to allow for planned fringe communities consisting of 14,000 new homes and up to 40,000 new residents, effectively doubling the city's urban area by extending the urban sprawl from <b>Sebastopol,</b> Delacombe and Alfredton west toward Bonshaw, Smythes Creek and Cardigan with a new suburb to be known as Lucas to be created. New activity centres are to be developed at Delacombe and Alfredton.|$|E
25|$|At {{the test}} {{orchards}} in Louisiana, Missouri, in <b>Sebastopol,</b> California and Atlas, Illinois, the Starks kept faith with the Burbank trust, and still do. The Garden Center {{is housed in}} The Luther Burbank Building. Stark Bro’s has produced or discovered superior varieties or strains of more than 300 varieties of pears, plums, peaches, cherries, grapes, prunes, strawberries, raspberries and ornamentals. These discoveries are {{a direct result of}} being chosen to carry on Luther’s experiments. The Starks have often gratefully remarked that the company would never have been as successful without their association with Luther Burbank. The great Luther Burbank was posthumously inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame on February 10, 1986 by then-president Clay Stark Logan, an enormous honor for him and the Stark family.|$|E
25|$|Australian rules {{football}} is played at semi-professional and amateur levels {{with a large}} number of players at numerous venues, both dedicated such as Eureka Stadium and shared with cricket. The North Ballarat Roosters based out of Eureka Stadium compete in the Victorian Football League. The Western Bulldogs AFL Club will commence playing periodic home games at the redevloped Eureka Stadium from 2017. The Ballarat Football League (founded 1893) is a strong regional league of which there are 6 local teams (Ballarat, EastPoint, Redan, <b>Sebastopol,</b> Lake Wendouree and North Ballarat City). The Ballarat Football Club (founded 1860) remains one of the oldest football clubs in the world. Other city teams from Buninyong and North Ballarat compete in the regional Central Highlands Football League.|$|E
25|$|Law {{enforcement}} is overseen from regional police headquarters {{at the law}} complex in Dana Street with a single local police station operating in Buninyong. Due {{to an increase in}} crime rates and population, two additional local police stations were proposed in 2011 one each for the suburbs of North Ballarat and <b>Sebastopol.</b> Justice is conducted locally overseen through branches of the Supreme, County, Magistrates and Children's Court of Victoria which operate out of the Ballarat courts Complex adjacent police headquarters in Dana Street. Corrections, at least in the longer term are no longer handled locally since the closure of the Ballarat Gaol in 1965. Offenders can be detained in 25 available cells at the police complex though are commonly transferred to nearby Corrections Victoria facilities such as the Hopkins Correctional Centre in Ararat.|$|E
25|$|Data {{communications}} {{are provided}} by several companies. Telstra was the first company to provide dial-up Internet access via the Ballarat exchange, however the first network for broadband Internet access available in the city was a hybrid optical fiber cable and coaxial cable built by Neighbourhood Cable in 2001. Since then, Telstra and Optus have entered the Ballarat market, providing Asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) services for residential Internet access from four main exchanges—Ballarat, Wendouree (Howitt Street), <b>Sebastopol</b> (Skipton Street) and Alfredton (Cuthberts Road). These companies also provide mobile data access Evolved HSPA and since late 2011 3GPP Long Term Evolution (4G). Ballarat's rollout of the National Broadband Network (NBN) is seen as vital for the city's growing IT industry. During Ballarat's first stage NBN rollout in 2012, 17,800 homes will be directly connected to the network via optical fibre cable.|$|E
25|$|Public {{safety and}} {{emergency}} services {{are provided by}} several state funded organisations including local volunteer based organisations. Storms and flooding are handled by the State Emergency Service (SES) Mid West Region Headquarters at Wendouree.

25|$|He named Stark Bro’s Nurseries & Orchards Co. {{to carry}} on the work. Considerable {{argument}} has been spent upon whether the plants were technically willed to Stark Bro’s; they were not. He left everything to Elizabeth: money, personal property, real estate, dozens of municipal utility bonds — and the plants and precious seeds. Elizabeth had first approached both Stanford and Berkeley to have either or both universities take over the experimental farm, but sold to Stark when those proffers didn’t materialize. Mrs. Burbank entered into an agreement with Stark Bro’s on Aug 23, 1927 to take the material they wanted from Burbank’s properties. The contract included ownership of the business name and all of the customer information. A September 6, 1927 contract provided exclusive rights to sell uncompleted experiments with fruits at <b>Sebastopol</b> (except the Royal and Paradox) for 10 years. Stark Bro’s had right of renewal. Tax receipts indicate payments of $27,000 to Mrs. Burbank. Exciting new kinds of fruits and flowers Burbank had developed (but never marketed) included 120 types of plums, 18 peaches, 28 apples, 500 hybrid roses, 30 cherries, 34 pears, 52 gladioli and many more. Stark Bro’s subsequently introduced many of these varieties in their catalog.|$|E

500|$|Just before 06:30, Yavuz sighted <b>Sebastopol</b> and {{proceeded}} to bombarded the port for 15 minutes. During this time she exchanged fire with the pre-dreadnought [...] and shore batteries. Three heavy caliber shells from the batteries managed to damage Yavuz before she withdrew. The loaded Russian minelayer [...] happened upon the attack and was scuttled by her crew to avoid being detonated. Since Pruts arrival had been expected, the defensive minefield around the port was inoperative. By {{the time it was}} activated 20 minutes later, the Ottomans had cleared the area.

500|$|After it was {{recorded}} at the <b>Sébastopol</b> Theatre in Lille on 5 October 2012, {{the show was}} released on DVD, Blu-ray and video on demand on 6 March 2013; it includes a commentary track by Rollin and Joyet, and a making-of documentary called La boucle est bouclée ("We've come full circle") filmed by Simon Astier, who followed Tsamere around with a camera {{on the day of}} the recording. Tsamere said he chose Lille for the recording because he has a [...] "special relationship" [...] with the place. On 23 September 2013, the show was broadcast on the television channel Comédie+—it was later shown on D17 on 31 August 2014, when it was seen by 254,000 people (a 1.1% audience share).|$|E
500|$|On 27 October, the Ottoman fleet put to sea {{under the}} guise of {{performing}} maneuvers. Enver had originally envisioned an encounter at sea in which the Ottoman's would claim self-defence, but Admiral Souchon conceived a direct assault on Russian ports. He would later say his intention was [...] "to force the Turks, even against their will, to spread the war." [...] The German battlecruiser, now known as Yavuz Sultan Selim, was to sail with two destroyers and a gunboat to attack <b>Sebastopol.</b> The light cruiser Breslau, now known as Midilli, protected cruiser , and the torpedo cruiser [...] were to attack Novorossiysk and Feodosia. Three destroyers were detailed for Odessa. On the way, one of these destroyers experienced engine trouble and was forced to turn back.|$|E
500|$|Tsamere met Rollin at the Dinard Comedy Festival, and {{he joined}} Tsamere and Joyet to write a second show, Chose Promise (Promised Thing). Written in 2007, it stars Tsamere as an {{economics}} teacher named Patrice Valenton, performing {{as part of a}} promise made to a friend who died in a car accident. He chose to perform as a character under Rollin's suggestion, so that he could depict failure under the guise of somebody who is not a comedian. Regarding the show's theme of death, he said [...] "It's a bit strange, but it has the virtue of attracting the public's attention". Tsamere's performance was well received by critics; Le Parisien called the show a [...] "masterpiece of the genre". Chose Promise was released on DVD on 6 March 2013 after being recorded at the Théâtre <b>Sébastopol</b> in Lille. Tsamere has done three tours of the show, and its final two performances were at the Olympia in February 2014.|$|E
500|$|On 9 October Enver told Ambassador Wangenheim {{that he had}} won {{the sympathy}} of Minister of Interior Mehmed Talaat and President of the Chamber of Deputies Halil Menteşe and that he planned on {{securing}} the support of Djemal. If that failed, he would provoke a cabinet crisis and create a pro-war government. After gaining Djemal's sympathies, the conspiring Ottomans informed the Germans that {{they would go to}} war as soon as they received the equivalent of two million lira in gold, money the Germans knew the Ottoman Empire would need to fund a war. The money was shipped through neutral Romania, and the last of it arrived on 21 October. Informants working for the Russian ambassador in Istanbul, Mikhail Nikolayevich von Giers, forwarded the information about the payments to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Sazonov. Sazonov had suspected the Ottomans' and Germans' intentions, and warned the Russian naval commanders in <b>Sebastopol</b> to be prepared for an attack. On 21 October, Admiral Kazimir Ketlinski assured the foreign minister that the Black Sea Fleet was [...] "completely ready" [...] for action.|$|E

2500|$|He was {{promoted}} to Brigadier General at Gallipoli in 1854, {{en route to the}} Crimea and led a Brigade (the combined 1st and 2nd Regiments of the Foreign Legion) in the Crimean War. He fought several decisive actions at the Battle of the Alma in 1854 and during the siege of <b>Sebastopol</b> (1854/55) where he maintained his reputation and for which he was mentioned in dispatches on several occasions. The way in which he conducted the left wing of the French forces in the final Allied assault on <b>Sebastopol</b> on 8 September 1855 (wounded, shell fragment in left hip, his horse killed under him), received acclaim of the highest order from the Allied Command and he was subsequently promoted to Major General (General de Division) on 22 September 1855 and selected from all the Allied Generals to assume the Governorship of <b>Sebastopol.</b> At 44, this made him the youngest General in the French Army. In October 1855, Bazaine was chosen to give the coup de grâce. With a mixed French and British Force, he sailed to Kinburn {{at the mouth of the}} Dnieper to attack the remaining Russian forces to the North of <b>Sebastopol.</b> He led a daring landing and seized the naval fortress with a frontal assault, an action for which he received particular praise: [...] "General Bazaine who commands that portion of the French Army now operating at the mouth of the Dnieper may be cited as presenting one of the most brilliant examples of the achievement of military distinction in the modern day". At <b>Sebastopol,</b> on 25 June 1856 he was invested by the British Commander in Chief, Lord Gough, with the Order of the Bath, for his conspicuous contribution to the Allied campaign during the Crimean War. On his return to France in 1857, he was appointed Inspector General of the Army.|$|E
