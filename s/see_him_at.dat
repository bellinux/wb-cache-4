5|$|There {{are obvious}} {{connections}} {{in the design of}} the Slaying of Holofernes and the Slaying of Haman at the opposite end of the chapel. Although in the Holofernes picture the figures are smaller and the space less filled, both have the triangular space divided into two zones by a vertical wall, allowing us to see what is happening on both sides of it. There are actually three scenes in the Haman picture because as well as seeing Haman punished, we <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>at</b> the table with Esther and the King and get a view of the King on his bed. Mordechai sits on the steps, making a link between the scenes.|$|E
5|$|Rhys {{gives his}} mother her ring {{back and she}} realises that he still loves Vanessa. Rhys {{receives}} a letter from his father, Eddie (Ned Manning), but refuses to open it. Eddie calls the house, but Rhys is short with him. While Rhys is choosing whether to see his father or not, Elaine gives him all the letters he ever wrote to him and tells him to read them first. Rhys later decides to see his father. During Sonya and Toadie's wedding reception, a gas bottle explodes destroying the marquee. Rhys is initially trapped inside, but he manages to pull himself out. He suffers some minor injuries and broken ribs. Elaine comes to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>at</b> the hospital and she tells him that she supports his decision to see his father. Rhys discharges himself, against Karl's wishes. He then collapses in the car park and dies from an undetected blood clot.|$|E
5|$|Roma's {{difficult}} {{start to}} the 2008–09 season and continued struggles {{at the start of}} the 2009–10 season saw Spalletti resign after his four-year reign and he was replaced by Claudio Ranieri. Totti performed well in the inaugural UEFA Europa League; he scored two hat-tricks in the competition that season, first in a 7–1 away win against Gent in the third qualifying round and then another in the same scoreline against MFK Košice at the Stadio Olimpico in the play-off round. In Serie A, he also scored three goals against Bari on 22 November 2009, seven years on from his last hat-trick in Serie A. Eight days later, Totti confirmed he had signed a new five-year playing contract which would <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>at</b> the club until 2014, after which he stated he would become a club director for a further five years. Roma offered him an annual salary of €8.9million for 2009–10 and €8.6million a year for the next four seasons.|$|E

5|$|Amy {{discovers that}} Kyle's adoptive parents have died. She and Victoria attend the funeral {{to see if}} Kyle is there and <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>at</b> the wake with his adoptive grandmother, Joanie Wright (Denise Black). When Kyle drops his toy, Amy {{picks it up and}} tries to give it back but Joanie doesn't hear her so she keeps it. Amy returns the next day and a barmaid gives her Joanie's address. Amy plans to return the toy but changes her mind and leaves. Needing to see Kyle, she persuades Andy to let her take baby Jack to Kyle's playgroup and makes friends with Joanie, telling her that she is {{studying}} childcare and asking if she needs any help with Kyle. Joanie accepts and allows Amy to look after Kyle occasionally. Val is thrilled when she finds out but Victoria and Eric think it is a bad idea and Eric tells Joanie that Amy is Kyle's birth mother. Disgusted, Joanie refuses to let Amy see Kyle again but is eventually persuaded to change her mind. Sadly, while Amy and Kyle are on a picnic together, Kyle almost drowns and Joanie blames Amy. She promptly bans her from seeing Kyle and refuses to even consider changing her mind, even calling the police when Amy visits repeatedly, who warn her to stay away. Desperate to see her son, Amy and Andy (who she is now dating) call Social Services to see if she can get custody but the social worker tells her that being awarded custody is very unlikely. Feeling now that the adoption was a mistake, Amy decides to snatch Kyle and go on the run. Kerry, understanding how Amy feels, tries to talk her out of it but when she can't, decides to help her. They go to Kyle's playgroup and kidnap him and Kerry drives them to the docks. During the drive, Val phones repeatedly but they don't answer. Eventually Kerry answers and Amy tearfully reveals her plans before throwing the phone away. Eric checks the computer's internet history and finds out where Amy is going. Cain, Andy, Val, Eric and Joanie all rush to the docks. In the end, Cain persuades Amy to return Kyle, warning her of the complications of the life on the run and how Kyle might be affected. She says goodbye to Kyle and gives him to Cain but fearing she'll be sent to prison, Amy leaves, devastating Val. Val later gets a call from Amy and learns that she is living in Ireland with her aunt.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{signed for}} League Two team Notts County on a two-year {{contract}} on 22 July 2009, {{on the same}} day that Sven-Göran Eriksson arrived at the club as director of football. He scored a hat-trick on his debut in a 5–0 victory over Bradford City on the opening day of the season. He then got his second hat-trick against Northampton Town in a 5–2 home win on 12 September. He claimed his third hat-trick of the campaign on 28 December during a 4–1 win over Burton Albion at the Pirelli Stadium. However the club endured a turbulent time, with manager Ian McParland sacked and replaced by Hans Backe, who himself resigned after Qadbak Investments proved unable to fund Backe's wages. New owner Ray Trew appointed Steve Cotterill as manager, and County entered April ten points behind league leaders Rochdale, though Hughes remained confident that they could reduce the deficit and win the league. On 17 April, Hughes scored two goals in a 4–1 victory over Morecambe as County won promotion to League One. He was named as League Two's Player of the Month in April. On 1 May, Hughes added another two goals in County's final home game of the season, making him the first Notts player to score 30 league goals since Tommy Lawton in the 1949–50 season. He finished as the division's top-scorer in 2009–10 with 30 league goals in 39 games, and was named on the PFA Team of the Year alongside teammates Kasper Schmeichel and Ben Davies. County won the league by a ten-point margin. In July 2010, Hughes signed a one-year extension to his contract that would <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>at</b> Meadow Lane until the summer of 2012.|$|E

25|$|The {{result was}} a synod held in Split in 926, which {{confirmed}} John’s request; it forbade the ordination of anyone ignorant of Latin, and forbade Mass to be said in the Slav tongue, except {{when there was a}} shortage of priests. The decrees of the synod were sent to Rome for John’s confirmation, who confirmed them all except for the ruling which placed the Croatian Bishop of Nona {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Archbishop of Spalatro. He summoned the parties to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>at</b> Rome, but they were unable to attend, forcing John to send some papal legates to settle the matter, which were only resolved by Pope Leo VI after John’s deposition and death.|$|E
25|$|After some time, preaching by the Letters of the Living led to {{opposition}} by the Islamic clergy, {{prompting the}} Governor of Shiraz {{to order the}} Báb's arrest. The Báb, upon hearing of the arrest order, left Bushehr for Shiraz in June 1845 and presented himself to the authorities. He was placed under house arrest {{at the home of}} his uncle until a cholera epidemic broke out in the city in September 1846. The Báb was released and departed for Isfahan. There, many came to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>at</b> the house of the imam jum'a, head of the local clergy, who became sympathetic. After an informal gathering where the Báb debated the local clergy and displayed his speed in producing instantaneous verses, his popularity soared. After the death of the governor of Isfahan, Manouchehr Khan Gorji, who had become his supporter, pressure from the clergy of the province led to the Shah, Mohammad Shah Qajar, ordering the Báb to Tehran in January 1847. After spending several months in a camp outside Tehran, and before the Báb could meet the Shah, the Prime Minister sent the Báb to Tabriz in the northwestern corner of the country, where he was confined.|$|E
25|$|As {{he entered}} St. Peter's Square to address an {{audience}} on 13 May 1981, Pope John Paul II {{was shot and}} critically wounded by Mehmet Ali Ağca, an expert Turkish gunman {{who was a member}} of the militant fascist group Grey Wolves. The assassin used a Browning 9mm semi-automatic pistol, shooting the pope in the abdomen and perforating his colon and small intestine multiple times. John Paul II was rushed into the Vatican complex and then to the Gemelli Hospital. On the way to the hospital, he lost consciousness. Even though the two bullets missed his mesenteric artery and abdominal aorta, he lost nearly three-quarters of his blood. He underwent five hours of surgery to treat his wounds. Surgeons performed a colostomy, temporarily rerouting the upper part of the large intestine to let the damaged lower part heal. When he briefly regained consciousness before being operated on, he instructed the doctors not to remove his Brown Scapular during the operation. One of the few people allowed in to <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>at</b> the Gemelli Clinic was one of his closest friends philosopher Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka, who arrived on Saturday 16 May and kept him company while he recovered from emergency surgery. The pope later stated that Our Lady of Fátima helped keep him alive throughout his ordeal.|$|E

25|$|An {{incident}} {{regarding the}} character of Sidney Dillon (or William S. Paley) is then discussed between Jonesy and Mrs. Coolbirth. Sidney Dillon {{is said to have}} told Ina Coolbirth this story because they have a history as former lovers. One evening while Cleo Dillon (Babe Paley) was out of the city, in Boston, Sidney Dillon attended an event by himself at which he was seated next to the wife of a prominent New York Governor. The two began to flirt and eventually went home together. While Ina suggests that Sidney Dillon loves his wife, it is his inexhaustible need for acceptance by haute New York society that motivates him to be unfaithful. Sidney Dillon and the woman sleep together, and afterwards Mr. Dillon discovers a very large blood stain on the sheets, which represents her mockery of him. Mr. Dillon then spends {{the rest of the night}} and early morning manually washing the sheet with scalding water in an attempt to conceal his unfaithfulness from his wife who is due to arrive home the same morning. In the end, Dillon falls asleep on a damp sheet and wakes up to a note from his wife telling him she had arrived while he was sleeping, did not want to wake him, and that she would <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>at</b> home.|$|E
500|$|On July 11, 2005, Hardy {{posted on}} his website {{that he was}} finally [...] "free", that wrestling fans {{had not seen the}} last of him, and that he had a {{surprise}} for the fans who had supported him. That night on Raw, Hardy attacked Edge backstage and again later during Edge's match with Kane, leaving the commentators speechless. Before being escorted out of the building by security, Hardy stated that Edge and Lita would pay for their actions and told fans that they could <b>see</b> <b>him</b> <b>at</b> Ring of Honor while security officials and event staff were trying to restrain him. Hardy also called out Johnny Ace as security had him in handcuffs taking him out of the arena. This caused an uproar amongst fans, who were confused and wondered if the whole thing was a work or a shoot. Similar occurrences repeated during the following two weeks.|$|E

Johnny {{and his daughter}} spend time together in his hotel suite and he brings her with him on his daily routine and on a publicity trip to Milan (where he is awarded with a [...] "Telegatto", in a show with local celebrities playing themselves), and through preparations for her departure to summer camp. As their time together grows, Johnny's fatherly emotions emerge and force him to re-assess his otherwise [...] "successful" [...] life. After Cleo leaves for camp Johnny calls his ex-wife and tearfully breaks down admitting his unhappiness at his empty life. His ex-wife is indifferent to his pain and declines his request to come <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> <b>At</b> the end, Johnny checks {{out of the hotel}} promising not to return, and drives his Ferrari into the countryside. He randomly stops and gets out, leaving the keys in the ignition, and walks down the highway smiling.|$|E
