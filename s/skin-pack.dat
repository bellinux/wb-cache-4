The background to this is that HABO is not pleased with the system currently in use. The system which HABO is currently using consists of to many sizes. The largest benefit of a standard stated system is that it becomes much easier to organize the packaging {{with the aid of a}} computer program. If one manages to standardize the packaging system if will be much easier to calculate how much space that is required for the products in the store. It also enables HABO to sell pre defined product groups. The basic condition for the system is that it should be compatible with Hestra wall panels and store equipment. The store equipment proved to be very determining during the project. Due to its design the number of possible variations of sizes decreased considerably. Much of the work has been simulated in a computer model which has been constructed in ProEngineer. With aid of the model suitable packaging sizes could be tested on Hestras wall panels. The work resulted in a system with three different width sizes (74, 116 and 158 mm), compared to the present five. The number of lengths was set to four (118, 182, 246 and 374 mm) in comparison with today where the length is decided for each product individually. In order for the system to work properly it is crucial the HABOs suppliers can guarantee a specified length for all of the different packaging sizes. The basic principle is that both SB-pack and <b>Skin-pack</b> should be possible to combine to achieve the most effective system. A couple of improvements were also considered. Standard setting of the width proved to be the hardest challenge. Therefore an alternative could be to use a gliding spear instead of Hestras traditional panel. This allows the spear to be continuously variable. This allows more freedom when it comes to designing the packaging. Regarding different types of packaging SB-pack with long back or colored plastic bag is preferred instead of the traditional SB-pack. The products are displayed in a better fashion and it gives a better impression...|$|E
