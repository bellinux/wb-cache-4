5|$|Ongoing {{negotiations}} through March yielded {{an agreement}} on March 7, 1999, {{over the objections of}} the State Department. The proceeds of the series were a major <b>sticking</b> <b>point</b> in negotiations, as it violated the United States embargo against Cuba. Instead of going to the Cuban Government, it was agreed that proceeds would fund baseball programs in Cuba.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{determined}} {{resistance of}} the 99th Division, which was composed of relatively inexperienced troops, along with the experienced 2nd and 30th Divisions, the northern shoulder of the Battle of the Bulge was a <b>sticking</b> <b>point</b> for the entire offensive operation. Had the Americans given way, the German advance would have overrun the vast supply depots around Liège and Spa and possibly have changed {{the outcome of the}} Battle of Bulge.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the British {{government}} {{comes under}} public pressure {{to resolve the}} problem. It becomes clear to the British diplomats assigned {{to find a solution}} that defeating the Burgundians through starvation is both difficult and unpopular with the British people, so they negotiate. The <b>sticking</b> <b>point</b> {{turns out to be the}} disposition of the unearthed treasure. Wix, now the Burgundian Chancellor of the Exchequer, suggests a Burgundian loan of the treasure to Britain. With the final piece of the deadlock eliminated, Burgundy reunites with Britain, which also sees the return of rationing for food and clothing to the area. The celebratory outdoor banquet is interrupted by heavy rain.|$|E

Why, {{the other end}} of the <b>stick</b> always <b>points</b> the opposite way. It depends whether you get hold of the stick by the right end. I saw the thing done once and I've never believed in it since." [...] And he proceeded to tell the story of his disillusionment.|$|R
5|$|In November 1558, Henry VIII's elder daughter, Mary I of England, was {{succeeded by}} her only {{surviving}} sibling, Elizabeth I. Under the Third Succession Act, passed in 1543 by the Parliament of England, Elizabeth was recognised as her sister's heir, and Henry VIII's {{last will and testament}} had excluded the Stuarts from succeeding to the English throne. Yet, {{in the eyes}} of many Catholics, Elizabeth was illegitimate, and Mary Stuart, as the senior descendant of Henry VIII's elder sister, was the rightful queen of England. Henry II of France proclaimed his eldest son and daughter-in-law king and queen of England, and in France the royal arms of England were quartered with those of Francis and Mary. Mary's claim to the English throne was a perennial <b>sticking</b> <b>point</b> between her and Elizabeth I.|$|E
5|$|Diplomatic efforts {{between the}} Netherlands and the Republic {{continued}} throughout 1948 and 1949. Political pressures, {{both domestic and}} international, hindered Dutch attempts to decide upon objectives. Similarly, Republican leaders faced great difficulty in persuading their people to accept diplomatic concessions. By July 1948 negotiations were in deadlock and the Netherlands pushed unilaterally towards Van Mook’s federal Indonesia concept. The new federal states of South Sumatra and East Java were created, although neither had a viable support base. The Netherlands set up the Bijeenkomst voor Federaal Overleg (BFO) (or Federal Consultative Assembly), a body comprising {{the leadership of the}} federal states, and charged with the formation of a United States of Indonesia and an interim government by the end of 1948. The Dutch plans, however, had no place for the Republic unless it accepted a minor role already defined for it. Later plans included Java and Sumatra but dropped all mention of the Republic. The main <b>sticking</b> <b>point</b> in the negotiations was the balance of power between the Netherlands High Representative and the Republican forces.|$|E
5|$|In August 1943, the Quebec Agreement subsumed the British Tube Alloys project {{into the}} Manhattan Project, and {{established}} the Combined Policy Committee {{to control the}} Manhattan Project. A final agreement was spelt out on 20 May 1944. Under it, the Americans would assist {{with the construction of}} a heavy water-moderated nuclear reactor in Canada, and would provide technical assistance with matters such as corrosion and the effects of radiation on materials. They would not provide details about plutonium chemistry or metallurgy, although irradiated uranium slugs were made available for the British to work it out for themselves. A <b>sticking</b> <b>point</b> was the director of the Montreal Laboratory, Hans von Halban, who was a poor administrator, did not work well with the Canadians, and was regarded as a security risk by the Americans. In April 1944 a Combined Policy Committee meeting at Washington agreed that Montreal Laboratory scientists who were not British subjects would leave, and Cockcroft would become the new director of the Montreal Laboratory in May 1944.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{developments}} of strandpulling include longer cables which provide {{a greater variety}} of whole-body movements, being largely cable-stretching substitutes for weight-training exercises.

50|$|On December 15 to 16, 2014 the U.S. and Iranian {{delegations}} met in Geneva {{to prepare}} for the multilateral talks, led by Wendy Sherman and Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi. A member of Tehran's team told IRNA that uranium enrichment and how to remove sanctions were <b>sticking</b> <b>points</b> in the bilateral talks.|$|R
5|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} a network of foreign businessmen in Japan who could be turned into an intelligence network in time of war, it was suggested by his commander, Colonel Burnett, that Mashbir resign his commission and become a businessman in Tokyo himself, {{in order to put}} the M-Plan in effect. Consequently, Mashbir resigned in 1923 to pursue business interests and undercover secret intelligence operations, under the impression that he could be reinstated in the Army when his work was done. However the Great Kantō earthquake of September 1923 bankrupted him and, when he sought reinstatement in the military, discovered that it was not possible, because the reinstatement clause of the law under which he had resigned was no longer valid. Neither Mashbir nor Colonel Burnett, who had urged Mashbir to resign, was aware of this, and it become a <b>sticking</b> <b>point</b> for Mashbir in later life, noting that even in 1926 the law was still being reprinted without the correct clause. Consequently, the M-Plan to establish an intelligence network in Japan was scrapped. Mashbir returned to the United States in 1926 under the impression that his military career was over, and sought employment selling refrigerators. He managed to rejoin the Military Intelligence Division G-2 Reserves, but only spent one year in active duty beginning in the summer of 1927 during which time he updated the Order of Battle documentation on Japan. For the next ten years he returned to his original profession of engineering, including some government work on technical standards.|$|E
25|$|Talks {{between the}} union and the {{government}} proceeded without much progress. The main <b>sticking</b> <b>point</b> was compensation, with the government offering a 10% increase (up from 8%) over four years and the union asking for a 19% increase (down from 24%) over three years.|$|E
25|$|The major <b>sticking</b> <b>point</b> was wages. The {{state had}} offered a wage {{increase}} of about 2.5 {{percent per year}} but said that additional increases based on years of service could increase that to about 5 percent for many workers. The members were asking for increases of approximately 6 percent per year for the coming years.|$|E
5000|$|Mobile {{phones in}} China are {{controlled}} by MIIT. Mobile phones coming out in China in 2009 required to support the WAPI standard. [...] One of the <b>sticking</b> <b>points</b> behind the iPhone in China was the support of WiFi without the WAPI standard. In the end, it was released without any WLAN at all.|$|R
50|$|During the negotiations, De Klerk's {{government}} {{pushed for}} a two-phase transition with an appointed transitional government with a rotating presidency. The ANC pushed instead for a transition in a single stage to majority rule. Other <b>sticking</b> <b>points</b> included minority rights, decisions on a unitary or federal state, property rights, and indemnity from prosecution for politically motivated crimes.|$|R
50|$|To create design contours, artists use {{a bamboo}} or date palm <b>stick</b> <b>pointed</b> {{at one end}} with a bundle of fine hair {{attached}} to this pointed end {{to serve as the}} brush or pen.

25|$|The <b>sticking</b> <b>point</b> in {{the strike}} was recognition: the union demanded a closed shop, a coastwide {{contract}} and a union hiring hall. The employers offered to arbitrate the dispute, but {{insisted that the}} union agree to an open shop {{as a condition of}} any agreement to arbitrate. The longshoremen rejected the proposal to arbitrate.|$|E
25|$|A {{second round}} of talks took place in Washington, D.C., late in February 2015. Negotiators {{described}} the talks as productive and said several issues were close to resolution. However, the issue of Cuba's listing among state sponsors of terrorism by the U.S. government remained a significant <b>sticking</b> <b>point,</b> although Cuban diplomat Josefina Vidal said its removal was not strictly a precondition to reopening embassies.|$|E
25|$|The Balibo Five {{proved a}} {{significant}} <b>sticking</b> <b>point</b> {{in the relationship}} between Australia and Indonesia, a weakness which was compounded by a 1986 Sydney Morning Herald article which discussed Suharto's business dealings in a negative light. The growing prominence of trade and investment for the relationship, however, led to the steady growth of trade between the two countries beginning in the 1980s, with average growth of up to 19%.|$|E
5000|$|During {{his time}} in office were held {{negotiations}} with the Americans about Ganci U.S. Base at Manas airport which ended in June 2006 inconclusively. But Foreign Minister Jekshenkulov suggested the dispute was {{not just about the}} rent. He listed [...] "ecology, security, and taxes" [...] among the other <b>sticking</b> <b>points</b> that were examined during the past two days.|$|R
25|$|Paris {{talks were}} hanging {{over a few}} issues: France protested moves to cut {{subsidies}} to farmers, while the US, Australia, the EU, Brazil and India failed to agree on issues relating to chicken, beef and rice. Most of the <b>sticking</b> <b>points</b> were small technical issues, making trade negotiators fear that agreement on large politically risky issues will be substantially harder.|$|R

25|$|On 18 June 2007, the European Union {{promised to}} resume direct {{aid to the}} Palestinian Authority, and Abbas {{dissolved}} the National Security Council, a <b>sticking</b> <b>point</b> in the defunct unity government with Hamas. That same day, the United States decided to end its fifteen-month embargo on the Palestinian Authority and resume aid, attempting to strengthen Abbas's West Bank government. A day later, the Fatah Central Committee cut off all ties and dialogue with Hamas, pending the return of Gaza.|$|E
25|$|On January 19, 2010, {{multiple}} {{media outlets}} reported that O'Brien and NBC {{were close to}} signing a deal between $30 and $40 million for the host {{to walk away from}} the network. One apparent <b>sticking</b> <b>point</b> in the negotiations was the amount his staff and crew were to be paid for leaving the program. Reports also said that the contract could prohibit O'Brien from badmouthing NBC in any way, and that he may be able to return to television as early as September 2010.|$|E
25|$|Green {{dared not}} refuse the AFL {{executive}} council's instructions {{to undertake a}} joint organizing drive, {{but he did not}} wholeheartedly implement a plan, either. For {{the first six months of}} the year, Green did nothing. After the creation of the federal Steel Labor Relations Board in late June 1935 (an independent labor relations board created by President Franklin D. Roosevelt because of the failures of the National Labor Board), Green worked with Tighe, steel industry executives and the steel board to create a plan to allow collective bargaining in the steel industry. The talks dragged on through the end of the year. The <b>sticking</b> <b>point</b> was the AFL's demand for representational exclusivity (the concept that if a majority of workers voted for the union then all employees in the bargaining unit should belong to the union).|$|E
50|$|Paris {{talks were}} hanging {{over a few}} issues: France protested moves to cut {{subsidies}} to farmers, while the US, Australia, the EU, Brazil and India failed to agree on issues relating to chicken, beef and rice.

50|$|The {{two major}} <b>sticking</b> <b>points</b> in the {{negotiations}} were New Zealand's wish for better access for its dairy products in Australia and Australia's wish for New Zealand to remove export incentives and quantitative restrictions.

25|$|After {{the draft}} had been {{approved}} by the electors of the colonies, it was taken to London in 1899, for the assent of the British Imperial Parliament. However the issue of Privy Council appeals remained a <b>sticking</b> <b>point</b> with a number of Australian and British politicians, including the Secretary of State for the Colonies, Joseph Chamberlain, the Chief Justice of South Australia, Sir Samuel Way, and the Chief Justice of Queensland, Sir Samuel Griffith. Indeed, in October 1899, Griffith made representations to Chamberlain soliciting suggestions from British ministers for alterations to the draft, and offering some alterations of his own. Indeed, such was the effect of these and other representations that Chamberlain called for delegates from the colonies to come to London to assist with the approval process, with a view to their approving any alterations that the British government might see fit to make; delegates were sent, including Deakin, Barton and Charles Kingston, although they were under instructions that they would never agree to changes.|$|E
25|$|The major <b>sticking</b> <b>point</b> {{for many}} in the {{question}} of human evolution was whether human mental faculties could have possibly been evolved. The gap between humans and even the smartest ape seemed too large, even for those who were sympathetic to Darwin's basic theory. Alfred Russel Wallace, the co-discoverer of evolution by natural selection, believed that the human mind was too complex to have evolved gradually, and began over time to subscribe to a theory of evolution that took more from spiritualism than it did the natural world. Darwin was deeply distressed by Wallace's change of heart, and much of the Descent of Man is in response to opinions put forth by Wallace. Darwin focuses less {{on the question of whether}} humans evolved than he does on showing that each of the human faculties considered to be so far beyond those of beasts—such as moral reasoning, sympathy for others, beauty, and music—can be seen in kind (if not degree) in other animal species (usually apes and dogs).|$|E
25|$|Impressed {{by the low}} bid for the {{construction}} contract submitted by the engineering firm Fox, Henderson and Co, the commission accepted the scheme and finally gave its public endorsement to Paxton's design in July 1850. He was exultant, but now had less than eight months to finalize his plans, manufacture the parts and erect the building {{in time for the}} Exhibition's opening, which was scheduled for 1 May 1851. Paxton was able to design and build the largest glass structure yet created, from scratch, in less than a year, and complete it on schedule and on budget. He was even able to alter the design shortly before building began, adding a high, barrel-vaulted transept across the centre of the building, at 90 degrees to the main gallery, under which he was able to safely enclose several large elm trees that would otherwise have had to be felled - thereby also resolving a controversial issue that had been a major <b>sticking</b> <b>point</b> for the vocal anti-Exhibition lobby.|$|E
