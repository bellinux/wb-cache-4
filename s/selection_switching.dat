Using this model, I show that switching costs are large and have quantitatively important implications for the sorting of individuals among contracts. How switching costs affect selection over time de-pends on the direction of changes in the contract space relative to the initial conditions. I find that in the present environment, on net, switching costs help sustain an adversely-selected equilibrium with large differences in risks between more and less generous contracts.

However, despite widespread use of terms such as adherence and compliance, there is little agreement on definitions or measurements. Nonadherence can be intermittent or continuous, voluntary or involuntary, and may be specific to single or multiple interventions, which makes reliable measurement problematic. Both direct and indirect methods of assessment have their limitations. The current literature focuses mainly on psychotic disorders. A large number of trials of various psychological, social, and pharmacologic interventions has been reported. The results are mixed, but interventions specifically designed to improve adherence with a more intensive and focused approach and interventions combining elements from different approaches such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, family-based, and community-based approaches have shown better outcomes. Pharmacologic interventions include careful drug <b>selection,</b> <b>switching</b> when a treatment is not working, dose adjustment, simplifying the treatment regimen, and the use of long-acting injections. The results for the most studied pharmacologic intervention, ie, long-acting injections, are far from clear, and there are discrepancies between randomized controlled trials, nationwide cohort studies, and mirror-image studies. Nonadherence with treatment is often paid far less attention in routine clinical practice and psychiatric training. Strategies to measure and improve adherence in clinical practice are based more on personal experience than on research evidence. This overview focuses on strategies used for improving treatment adherence in psychiatric disorders in the light of current evidence, with emphasis on public health aspects of treatment adherence and the management of nonadherence in routine clinical practice.

40|$|The {{first chapter}} takes {{advantage}} of the evolution of the regulatory and pricing environment {{in the first years of}} a large federal prescription drug insurance program for seniors - Medicare Part D - to explore interactions among adverse <b>selection,</b> <b>switching</b> costs, and regulation. I document evidence of both adverse selection of beneficiaries across contracts and switching costs for beneficiaries in changing contracts within Medicare Part D. Using an empirical model of contract choice and contract pricing, I show that in the present environment, on net, switching costs help sustain an adversely-selected equilibrium with large differences in risks between more and less generous contracts. I then simulate how switching costs may alter the impact of "filling" the Part D donut hole as implemented under the Affordable Care Act. I find that absent any switching costs, this regulation would have eliminated the differences in risks across contracts; however, in the presence of the switching costs that I estimate, the effect of the policy is largely muted. The second chapter (co-authored with Francesco Decarolis and Stephen Ryan) explores federal subsidy policies in Medicare Part D. We estimate an econometric model of supply and demand that incorporates the regulatory pricing distortions in the insurers' objective functions. Using the model, we conduct counterfactual analyses of what the premiums and allocations would be in this market under different ways of providing the subsidies to consumers. We show that some of the supply-side regulatory mechanisms, such as the tying of premiums and subsidies to the realization of average "bids" by insurers in a region, prove to be welfare-decreasing empirically. The third chapter studies two competing systems that comprise the German health insurance landscape. The two systems differ in the ability of insurers to underwrite individual-specific risk. In contrast to the community rating of the statutory insurance system, enrollees of the private plans face full underwriting and may be rejected by the insurers. I empirically assess to what extent the selection of "good risks" dominates the interaction between the two systems, using a regression discontinuity design based on statutory insurance enrollment mandates. I do not find compelling evidence of cream-skimming by private insurers from the statutory system. Motivated by this finding, I quantify the change in consumer welfare that would result if the government relaxed the statutory insurance mandate to lower income levels. by Maria A. Polyakova.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of monetary policy is an understanding of the transmission process: the mechanism through which the monetary policy actions of the Central Bank impact on aggregate demand and prices by influencing the investment and consumption decisions of households and firms. Thus, commercial banks are regarded as conveyers of monetary policy shocks and are expected to adjust retail interest rates in response to policy shocks one-to-one. In practice, commercial banks adjust their retail rates in response to changes in monetary policy with a lag of several months and this delay is often viewed as an impediment on the ability of the Central Bank to steer the economy. Several reasons, such as credit rationing and adverse <b>selection,</b> <b>switching</b> costs, risk sharing, consumer irrationality, structure of the financial system, menu costs and asymmetric information are some of the causes advanced for commercial banks retail rates being sticky. In spite of the important role of pass-through analysis in the monetary policy transmission process, it has received very little attention in Sub-Saharan Africa, especially in Cameroon and Nigeria, which have implemented a series of reforms. To this end, this study gives a comparative analysis of interest rate pass-through in Nigeria and Cameroon using retail rates (lending and deposit) and a discount rate (policy rate) from January 1990 to December 2010 for Nigeria and from January 1990 to June 2008 for Cameroon. The study examines the magnitude and speed of retail rate adjustments to changes in the Central Bank policy rate as well as examining the possibility of symmetric and asymmetric pass-through in both countries. In addition, the study also investigates whether there is pass-through of monetary policy from one country to the other. The empirical analysis employs four different types of co-integration techniques to test the presence of a long run co-integrating relationship between retail and the policy rates {{in order to ensure that}} the relationship detected is robust. Three sets of analyses are carried out in the study. Following Cottarelli and Kourelis (1994), the study employed a co-integration technique, firstly, to analyse pass-through for the entire sample, secondly, to analyse symmetric and asymmetric pass-through using a ten year rolling window analysis in an error correction framework. Finally, the policy rates were swapped around to investigate if there are transmissions of impulses from one country to the other. Overall, evidence from the entire sample and rolling window analysis suggests that monetary policy in Cameroon is less effective. This is perhaps one of the reasons why the Banque Des Etats De L’Afrique Centrale (BEAC) is unable to sterilise the excess liquidity of the banking sector in Cameroon. The long run pass-through of 0. 72 and 0. 71 for the entire sample, and the average long run pass-through for the rolling window of 0. 78 and 0. 76 for the lending and deposit rates, suggest that monetary policy is highly effective in Nigeria compared to Cameroon. The empirical evidence confirmed asymmetric adjustment in six rolling windows in the lending rate in Nigeria. Three rolling windows indicated that the direction of rigidity is downward, supporting Scholnick’s (1996) collusive pricing arrangement between banks, and the other three suggested that the lending rate is rigid in the upward direction, corroborating Scholnick’s (1996) customer reaction hypothesis. The deposit rate in Cameroon was also found to adjust asymmetrically and the direction of rigidity is downward, supporting Hannan and Berger’s (1991) customer reaction hypothesis. The investigation of impulse transmission between the two countries revealed that only the policy rate in Nigeria exerts some influence on the deposit rate in Cameroon. Policy recommendations are also discussed. ...|$|E

30|$|Channel {{feedback}} for multi-user (MU)-multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) {{has been}} widely studied and some results have been got with random vector quantization scheme. However, while the low rate fixed codebook feedbacks are adopted, the performance of zero forcing (ZF) MU-MIMO will decrease as the unpredictable inter-user interference is introduced because of quantized channel state information (CSI). To decrease inter-user interference in low rate fixed codebook feedback, an enhanced user <b>selection</b> <b>switch</b> (USS) feedback scheme for ZF MU-MIMO is proposed in this article. In USS feedback, the extra USS information is added after quantized CSI and received signal-to-noise ratio feedback. The USS information indicates inter-user interference {{and it can be}} used in user selection procedure to avoid large inter-user interference. Simulation results show that the proposed USS feedback scheme is efficient to solve the problems of unpredictable inter-user interference in conventional feedback scheme with low rate codebook in ZF MU-MIMO.|$|R
30|$|Moreover, most of {{the current}} {{communication}} system adopt small codebook size and fixed codebook structure, which both known by UE and BS, to reduce the system complexity feedback overhead. In this feedback scheme, the former performance analysis for RVQ will be not suitable. In low rate fixed codebook feedback scheme, the interference between paired users is the key problem and conventional feedback and user selection scheme have on mechanism to avoid large inter-user interference. To overcome this drawback in low rate fixed codebook feedback scheme, the reasons of large inter-user interference are analyzed detailed and an enhanced scheme named user <b>selection</b> <b>switch</b> (USS) feedback is proposed here. The USS feedback adds some extra information besides CSI and SNR to show the inter-user interference while performing ZF MU-MIMO transmission. With USS information, BS can avoid large inter-user interference in MU-MIMO transmission in user selection procedure and enhance MU-MIMO performance.|$|R
