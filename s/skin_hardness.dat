For the same treatment, skin hardening was independent of berry density, and the magnitude of this effect was cultivar-dependent.

40|$|Phenolic compounds, {{extractable}} from grape {{skins and}} seeds, have a notable {{influence on the}} quality of red wines. Many studies have clearly demonstrated the relationship between the phenolic composition of the grape at harvest time and its influence on the phenolic composition of the red wine produced. In many previous works the evolution of phenolic composition and relative extractability was normally studied on grapes sampled at different times during ripening, but at the same date the physiological characteristics of grape berries in a vineyard are often very heterogeneous. Therefore, the main goal of the study is to investigate the differences among mechanical properties, phenolic composition and relative extractability of Vitis vinifera L. cv Barbera grape berries, harvested at the same date from several vineyards, and calibrated according to their density at three levels of soluble solids (A = 235 ± 8, B = 252 ± 8 and C = 269 ± 8 g L- 1 sugar) with the aim of studying the influence of ripeness stages and growing locations on these parameters. Results on mechanical properties showed that the thickness of the berry skin (Spsk) was the parameter most affected by the different level of sugars in the pulp, while different <b>skin</b> <b>hardnesses,</b> evaluated by the break skin force (Fsk), were related to the cultivation sites. The latter were also observed to influence the mechanical characteristics of seeds. Generally, the anthocyanin content increased with the level of soluble solids, while the increase in the tannin content of the berry skin and seeds was less marked. However, significant changes in flavanols reactive to vanillin in the seeds were found. The cellular maturity index (EA%) was little influenced by the soluble solids content of grapes...|$|R

40|$|Background: With aging {{there is}} {{alteration}} of elastic {{properties of the}} skin and skin-blood flow. Aim: The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare age-related changes in selected biomechanical parameters of the skin (<b>skin</b> <b>hardness,</b> skin extensibility, relaxation time constant, &# 964;) and subcutaneous microcirculatory quality (SMQ) in individuals with and without venous diseases. Materials and Methods: Two groups were studied: the first group was of asymptomatic healthy individuals and the second group included patients with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) and venous ulceration, without edema. Both groups were subdivided to three age categories (21 - 40, 41 - 60 and 61 - 90 years old). <b>Skin</b> <b>hardness</b> was measured by durometer, extensibility and &# 964; were measured using extensometer and SQM was assessed via postural vasoconstrictive response (LDF). Results: Results showed that <b>skin</b> <b>hardness,</b> extensibility, and &# 964; -values were increased, whereas LDF was decreased in the older groups as compared with younger groups. These changes are attributed to alterations in the skin structure and reduced capillaries density networks. Similar behavior was found in the biomechanical and microcirculatory changes in patients with venous ulceration and CVI, but these changes were more increased further in older patients with venous ulceration as compared with older patients with CVI and that can be attribute to more intense response against tissue injury. Conclusions: Since aging elevated <b>skin</b> <b>hardness</b> and extensibility, but lowered vasoconstrictive response in individuals, with and without, venous diseases, we conclude that aging process is likely to cause an accumulation of damaged skin tissues and that could induce an apparent antigen-driven response that altered skin structure and the subsequent biomechanical properties obtained in this study...|$|E
40|$|Aims: The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the kinetics of anthocyanin extraction in berries of cv Brachetto and Nebbiolo, having {{the same level of}} total soluble solids, but with different <b>skin</b> <b>hardness.</b> Methods and results: A puncture test was carried out on berries calibrated according to their density, estimated by flotation in different salt solutions. For each variety, two groups of berries of different <b>skin</b> <b>hardness</b> were selected: soft (medium value). Spectrophotometric and HPLC methods were used to evaluate the kinetics of anthocyanin extraction in a hydroalcoholic buffer solution. In each of the examined cultivars, the grapes with a higher break skin force produced extracts with a higher content in total anthocyanin. The anthocyanin profile of extracts of Brachetto hard skin is characterized by a higher content of acetyl-glucosides. Conclusion: Texture analysis, which is fast and inexpensive, {{turned out to be an}} excellent analytical technique to verify <b>skin</b> <b>hardness</b> measurements. The break skin force proved to be a mechanical parameter able to estimate the extractability of anthocyanins with adequate reliability.

The impact of the sodium hydroxide content and dipping time on weight loss (WL) at different dehydration times was thoroughly assessed using central composite design (CCD) and response surface methodology (RSM). Furthermore, {{the effects of these}} two variables were also investigated on the skin mechanical properties of dehydrated grapes. The effect of these two pretreatment factors on the dehydration kinetics and <b>skin</b> <b>hardness</b> was satisfactorily fitted to regression models.

40|$|Biomimetic {{design of}} new {{materials}} uses nature as antetype, learning from {{billions of years}} of evolution. This work emphasizes the mechanical and tribological properties of <b>skin,</b> combining both <b>hardness</b> and wear resistance of its surface (the stratum corneum) with high elasticity of the bulk (epidermis, dermis, hypodermis). The key for combination of such opposite properties is wrinkling, being consequence of intrinsic stresses in the bulk (soft tissue) : Tribological contact to counterparts below the stress threshold for tissue trauma occurs on the thick hard stratum corneum layer pads, while tensile loads smooth out wrinkles in between these pads. Similar mechanism offers high tribological resistance to hard films on soft, flexible polymers, which is shown for diamond-like carbon (DLC) and titanium nitride thin films on ultrasoft polyurethane and harder polycarbonate substrates. The choice of these two compared substrate materials will show that ultra-soft substrate materials are decisive for the distinct tribological material. Hierarchical wrinkled structures of films on these substrates are due to high intrinsic compressive stress, which evolves during high energetic film growth. Incremental relaxation of these stresses occurs by compound deformation of film and elastic substrate surface, appearing in hierarchical nano-wrinkles. Nano-wrinkled topographies enable high elastic deformability of thin hard films, while overstressing results in zigzag film fracture along larger hierarchical wrinkle structures. Tribologically, these fracture mechanisms are highly important for ploughing and sliding of sharp and flat counterparts on hard-coated ultra-soft substrates like polyurethane. Concentration of polyurethane deformation under the applied normal loads occurs below these zigzag cracks. Unloading closes these cracks again. Even cyclic testing do not lead to film delamination and retain low friction behavior, if the adhesion to the substrate is high and the initial friction coefficient of the film against the sliding counterpart low, e. g. found for DLC...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} a detailed {{study on the}} influence of winegrape variety, <b>skin</b> <b>hardness</b> of fresh berries, and withering thermo-hygrometric conditions on the dehydration kinetics of the grape. Although some works focused on the changes in the weight loss rate during grape dehydration under different environment conditions for several varieties, the combined effect of the skin mechanical properties and the thermo-hygrometric conditions has not been previously considered. The skin break force was confirmed as the varietal marker. Furthermore, its role in the selection of the withering conditions was assessed. The fresh grape berries were classified into two groups (soft and hard) according to the skin break force, and four off-vine withering conditions were evaluated. The softer skins facilitated the dehydration process increasing the weight loss rate, but the increase was significant only at low temperatures. The increase in temperature and/or decrease in relative humidity was beneficial to the grape dehydration process. A weight loss of about 50 % after 12 days of withering was achieved at an air temperature of 28 °C and relative humidity of 40 %. Under the same dryer environmental conditions, a certain varietal effect on the dehydration kinetics was observed because a faster weight loss occurred for those grapes characterized by lower values of skin break force. These results suggest that the grape dehydration rate, influencing the quality of dessert wines, should be planned considering the <b>skin</b> <b>hardness</b> of fresh berries and the withering conditions. The skin break force represents a new variable that should be considered in modeling the withering process and in selecting, prior to harvest, the most appropriate vineyard for the dessert wines desired...|$|E

Previous studies from our group have shown that autologous adipose-derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) represent a promising approach to improve wound healing and, thereby, impact HTS development. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the influence of local delivery of ADRCs immediately following deep-partial thickness cutaneous injury on HTS development in the red Duroc (RD) porcine model. Methods Bilateral pairs of deep-partial thickness excisional wounds (2  mm depth; 58  cm 2 area) were created using an electric dermatome on RD pigs (n[*]=[*] 12). Autologous ADRCs were isolated from the inguinal fat pad and then sprayed directly onto the wound at a dose of 0. 25 [*]×[*] 106 viable cells/cm 2. The paired contralateral wound received vehicle control. Wound healing and development of HTS were assessed over 6  months using digital imaging, quantitative measurement of <b>skin</b> <b>hardness</b> and pigmentation, and histology. Results Data showed that ADRC treatment led to reduced scar hyperpigmentation compared to control (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). Using the Durometer, at 2 and 6  months post-injury, <b>skin</b> <b>hardness</b> was 10 – 20 % lower in ADRCs-treated wounds compared to control vehicle (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). A similar trend was observed with the skin fibrometer. ADRC treatment promoted more normal collagen organization, improvement in the number of rete ridges (p[*]<[*] 0. 01), longer elastic fiber length (p[*]<[*] 0. 01), and reduced hypervascularity (blood vessel density; p[*]<[*] 0. 05). ADRC treatment was associated with modulation of IL- 6 expression within the wound/scar with upregulation 2  weeks after injury (wound healing phase) and downregulation at 2  months (early scarring phase) post-treatment compared to control Conclusions These findings support the potential therapeutic value of autologous ADRC administration for reduction of HTS development following deep-partial cutaneous injury...|$|E

This variability is often higher among different growing locations. Automatic, densimetric berry-sorting machines have recently been developed and proposed for use in wineries to reduce this variability, thereby making grapes uniform in terms of density. Densimetric sorting requires {{the selection of a}} density value according to objective quality parameters of the berries. The aim of this work was to determine the relationships among different objective quality parameters of Nebbiolo grapes harvested on the same date, such as mechanical properties, phenolic composition, and extractability indices; to determine the berry density estimated by flotation in different salt solutions of densities ranging from 1069 to 1125 kg m- 3; and to investigate the influence of the growing location on these relationships. The results revealed that the most promising physicochemical parameters for determining the appropriate density are the total anthocyanin and flavonoid concentrations in the skins, the total flavonoid and oligomer proanthocyanidin contents in the seeds, and <b>skin</b> <b>hardness</b> and thickness. Nevertheless, density selection must be performed for each individual vineyard or homogeneous group of vineyards belonging to the same production zone because the correlation of berry density with these parameters also depends on the vineyard effect. Densimetric sorting of berries can be used to separate grapes with different quality parameters...|$|E
40|$|In the oenological sector, the {{withering}} {{process is}} of particular importance {{in the production of}} dry and sweet dessert wines due to the total or partial use of overripe and/or dehydrated grapes. This complex process leads to several changes in the chemical-physical characteristics of white grape berries affecting the wine quality and, {{at the end of the}} dehydration period, different visual attributes are usually present in the berry skins. The aim of this work, therefore, was to study the properties of Erbaluce dried grapes of varying external colors, classified into three groups based on reflectance colorimetry (green, gold and blue). The chemical composition, volatile profile and mechanical attributes were investigated, focusing on establishing relationships between CIEL *. a *. b * parameters of dehydrated grapes and their chemical-physical characteristics. The higher values of the glucose-fructose ratio, together with the higher content of sugars, gluconic acid and glycerol, but lower titratable acidity, suggests the presence of. Botrytis cinerea Pers. infection in blue withered berries, which has been microbiologically confirmed. Regarding the instrumental mechanical properties, blue dehydrated grapes were characterized by a lower <b>skin</b> <b>hardness</b> and higher skin thickness in agreement with the higher weight loss experienced. Finally, the determination of free and bound volatile compounds showed that some of them were only found in blue withered berries, δ-lactones being considered the main chemical markers of the noble rot infection that are important for the odor character. C- 10 alkyl massoia lactone was the most abundant volatile compound in blue botrytized grapes...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} an enzyme {{preparation}} on {{the extraction of}} grape skin anthocyanins into a wine-like solution was evaluated during maceration (25. °C, 8. days). The study was performed on Vitis vinifera L. cv. Cabernet Sauvignon and Nebbiolo because of their different anthocyanin profiles, which {{are mainly composed of}} tri- and disubstituted forms, respectively. Maceration enzymes enhanced the skin releasing capacity for anthocyanins between 8 % and 15 % more, depending on the enzyme dose and variety, and shortened the time required to reach the maximum extraction yield by about 40. h, when compared to the control samples. The effect of enzymes on the profile and total content of anthocyanins during maceration was significant only for Cabernet Sauvignon. Therefore, a variety effect was found. In particular, the relative amount of malvidin glucosides increased up to 9 % more whereas that of delphinidin, cyanidin and peonidin glucosides decreased up to 5 %, 2 % and 3 % more, respectively, with the addition of the enzyme preparation. The results also showed lower anthocyanin degradation at maceration times longer than 72. h with the use of enzymes. Furthermore, the relationship between this enzyme effect and the instrumental <b>skin</b> <b>hardness</b> was assessed for the first time, as no previous study deals with the variation in the mechanical properties of the berry skin after using maceration enzymes. Significant positive relationships were found between the skin softening and the anthocyanin extraction yield (. R>. 0. 69, p<. 0. 01), which confirmed that the skin degradation by enzymes facilitates the anthocyanin release...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Sclerodermic skin {{diseases}} {{can cause}} severe morbidity and disability. UVA- 1 has {{shown to be}} an effective therapy for sclerodermic skin diseases. However, the period of remission in these patients is not clear. In this study, the effect and remission period of UVA- 1 phototherapy in various sclerotic skin diseases is described using a semiquantitative clinical score combined with the durometer score as an objective apparatus to measure the hardness of the skin. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to determine the effectiveness of UVA- 1 phototherapy and the duration of remission in sclerodermic skin diseases. METHODS: In this prospective study, 10 patients with various sclerodermic skin diseases were treated with UVA- 1 phototherapy. The durometer was used to observe the hardness of the <b>skin.</b> <b>Hardness</b> of the skin was measured by one investigator at 10 locations, distributed evenly on the representative sclerotic skin. Each spot was measured three times, and the average of each of these measurements was summed to give the total durometer score. Durometer scores were recorded weekly until the final treatment date and 4 weeks after treatment. Clinical scores were carried out at the end date of the treatment using a 6 -point scale semiquantitative score. Long-term effects were evaluated up to 29 - 46 months. RESULTS: The patients were treated with UVA- 1 in a cumulative dose of 1286 +/- 58. 8 (SEM) J/cm(2) (range, 846 - 1470 J/cm(2)) divided over five times a week for 4 weeks. In all patients studied, the sclerotic skin lesions were markedly softer after UVA- 1 treatment. All durometer scores improved highly significant during the first 3 weeks of treatment and borderline significant during the last week of treatment. There was no significant improvement between the end of UVA- 1 phototherapy and 1 month after ending the therapy (P > 0. 05). All patients noted improvement of the semiquantitative clinical score during treatment. Clinical improvement was associated with improvement of the durometer score (95 % confidence interval). With a follow-up until 46 months, the remission period was stable up to 26 months in six patients. The duration of sclerodermic skin diseases before start of treatment did not influence improvement in the clinical or durometer score. One patient had an acute side effect of minimal erythema. No other side effects, except tanning and fatigue, were noted. LIMITATIONS: This is an open-label uncontrolled study. CONCLUSION: UVA- 1 is an effective treatment for sclerodermic skin diseases with a long period of remission and clinical improvement even in patients with a long history of a sclerotic skin disease. UVA- 1 should be considered among the first approaches in the management of sclerotic skin diseases...|$|E
