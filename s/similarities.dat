30|$|Content <b>similarity</b> at both book {{level and}} page level have been compared, and the {{relationship}} between books are clustered and classified (Spasojevic and Poncin 2011). In this paper, the method they used to preprocess text contents in a corpus and compute page pairwise <b>similarity</b> is word N-Gram model and Jaccard <b>similarity</b> measure. The first difference between our research and theirs is the research purpose. They tried to compare book-to-book <b>similarity</b> and page-to-page <b>similarity</b> for the relationship classifying, and our purpose is to compare page-to-page pairwise <b>similarity</b> across e-book revisions for learning footprint transferring. The second difference is the <b>similarity</b> measure. They proposed Locally Sensitive Hashing (LSH) which can be used to compute set <b>similarity</b> during a corpus also known as Jaccard <b>similarity.</b> In this paper, we compare two <b>similarity</b> measure cosine <b>similarity</b> and Jaccard <b>similarity</b> for the representation of page <b>similarity</b> and propose cosine <b>similarity</b> as a better <b>similarity</b> measure since it can perform faster than Jaccard <b>similarity.</b> Besides, page <b>similarity</b> was compared for the detection of web phishing (Sanglerdsinlapachai and Rungsawang 2010). In this paper, they tried to find a term frequency matrix for pages and used cosine <b>similarity</b> model to represent the <b>similarity</b> between pages. Their experiments were focused on comparing machine learning techniques and thresholds based on page <b>similarity</b> comparison and the performances represented by F-measure. In our research, instead of comparing web-based pages, we try to compare slide-based pages for learning footprints transferring across e-book revisions.|$|R

In a 2007 ribosomal DNA study, the spinner shark was found to be the most genetically divergent of all the requiem shark species examined save for the tiger shark (Galeocerdo cuvier), being less related to other Carcharhinus species than the lemon shark (Negaprion brevirostris).|$|E
