The two most alarming challenges {{that we have to}} address immediately and collectively are 1) climate change, due to the increase of the greenhouse gases (primarily CO 2) produced by human activities, and 2) resource depletion, partially due to the intensive demand for manufacturing goods. Therefore a business-as-usual scenario is not responsible. Industrial solid waste, such as <b>steelmaking</b> <b>slags,</b> {{is considered to be a}} suitable raw material for carbon dioxide sequestration due to its high content of calcium oxides. In addition, the utilization of <b>steelmaking</b> <b>slags</b> for carbon dioxide sequestration is beneficial for the iron and steel industries, where both slag and a large quantity of carbon dioxide are produced. Slag is a non-metallic by-product from iron and steel production that consists of various combinations of calcium, magnesium, and aluminum silicates. Not all steel slag is utilized innovatively to ensure zero waste and added value in the steel production chain. Very large amounts of this material are being dumped in slag disposal areas that could result in negative impacts on both human health and the environment in the long term. The objective of this dissertation is to illustrate the feasibility of utilizing both <b>steelmaking</b> <b>slags</b> and the CO 2 in the flue gas from steelmaking processes in an alternative method for the production of precipitated calcium carbonate.

Borrow pits have been {{identified}} as a source of oxygen-deficient water with hydrogen sulfide. It has become increasingly important to restore borrow pits to improve the marine environment. However, large quantities of sand materials are needed to restore borrow pits. Recently, dredged materials generated by sea route maintenance have been adopted instead of sand materials. However, one problem of dredged materials is that they can be weak ground materials. Therefore, slag-mixed material made from the dredged material and <b>steelmaking</b> <b>slag</b> has been proposed. In this study, control of hydrogen sulfide release resulting from changing the hardness of the slag-mixed materials has been examined. Hydrogen sulfide release strongly depends on the hardness of the slag-mixed material.

40|$|Capture {{and storage}} {{of carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) is internationally {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the main options for reducing atmospheric emissions of CO 2. In Finland, no suitable geological formations are known to exist for storing captured CO 2. However, fixing CO 2 as solid carbonates using silicate-based materials is an interesting alternative. The magnesium silicate deposits in Eastern Finland alone could be sufficient for storing 10 Mt CO 2 each year during a period of 200 - 300 years. Finnish <b>steelmaking</b> <b>slags</b> could also be carbonated, but the amounts produced provide a much smaller potential for CO 2 storage (0. 5 Mt CO 2 per year) than magnesium silicates provide. The aim of this thesis was to study the possibility of reducing CO 2 emissions by producing calcium and magnesium carbonates from silicate materials for the long-term storage of CO 2 using multi-step processes. The production of carbonates from <b>steelmaking</b> <b>slags</b> and serpentinite, a magnesium silicate ore available from a metal-mining site, was studied both experimentally and theoretically. On the basis of the results, process concepts were developed and evaluated. Finally, the stability of synthetic calcium and magnesium carbonates as a medium for CO 2 storage was assessed. Experiments with aqueous extraction and precipitation processes showed that magnesium and calcium can easily be extracted from <b>steelmaking</b> <b>slags</b> and natural silicate minerals using acids. Natural minerals seem to demand stronger acids for extraction than slags. Relatively pure calcium carbonate (80 - 90 % calcite) was produced at room temperature and a CO 2 pressure of 1 bar by adding sodium hydroxide to acetate solutions made from slag. Similarly, serpentinite was successfully converted into 93 - 100 % pure hydromagnesite (a magnesium carbonate), using nitric acid or hydrochloric acid for the dissolution of serpentinite and sodium hydroxide for precipitation. The conversion of raw material to carbonate ranged from 60 - 90 %. Although the results show that pure carbonates can be produced from industrial by-products and mining residues, the process concept suggested requires the recycling of large amounts of sodium hydroxide and acid, as well as low-grade heat for solvent evaporation. The methods suggested for recovering the spent chemicals were found to be expensive and cause more CO 2 emissions than the amount of CO 2 stored...|$|R
