30|$|In this study, we {{demonstrate}} that Sepsis- 3 {{is better than}} Sepsis- 2 at stratifying mortality among septic patients admitted in a strained ICU of a developing country. Sepsis- 3 criteria clearly categorized septic patients along a spectrum of severity, since mortality increased from 7 % in no-dysfunction-infected patients to 25 and 46 % for sepsis and septic shock patients, respectively. In contrast, in the Sepsis- 2 definitions, only the septic <b>shock</b> <b>criterion</b> {{was associated with a}} significantly higher mortality when compared to the severe sepsis and sepsis categories (44, 17 and 13 %, respectively). Moreover, a lactate level higher than 4  mmol/L improved the mortality prediction accuracy on both Sepsis- 2 and Sepsis- 3 definitions (Table  3).|$|E
40|$|This {{publication}} {{examines the}} influence of landing gears and runway roughness on the physical loading of glider pilots. To simulate glider landings on uneven runways a numerical simulation procedure was developed. An experimental method to measure roughness on grass runways is described. Landing gears of single and twin gliders with and without additional springs were systematically shock tested. It reveals that nearly all landing gears would require an additional spring to properly fulfill the current landing shock airworthiness requirements. Additionally it is shown that only landing gears acceptable landing shock load factors achieve acceptable whole-body vibration during runway operation. Uncritical values are only possible by (well adapted) additional springs. Therefore a slightly modified landing <b>shock</b> <b>criterion</b> can be applied instead of an extensive proof of acceptable whole-body vibration. Out of several possibilities to improve the landing shock requirements, one favourable modification is suggested. (orig.)

30|$|The {{definitions}} of sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock in children {{were established in}} 2005 by the International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference[43]. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) {{is defined by the}} presence of {{at least two of the}} followings: hypo- or hyperthermia, tachycardia or bradycardia, tachypnea or mechanical ventilation, and elevated or depressed leukocyte count. Sepsis is defined by SIRS in the presence of suspected or proven infection. Sepsis is qualified as severe in case of cardiovascular dysfunction, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or two or more other organ dysfunctions, whereas septic shock is defined by the association of sepsis and cardiovascular dysfunction. Because recruitment of patients in both studies evaluating children with cancer and septic shock preceded the consensus conference [40, 42], the authors based the septic <b>shock</b> <b>criteria</b> on the Task Force on Hemodynamic Support from the American College of Critical Care Medicine [44]. These former criteria correspond to the consensus conference {{definitions of}} severe sepsis or septic shock, allowing comparison with patients admitted to our PICU with such diagnoses.|$|R

These features include a reversal of plasma flows from earthward to tailward, a pair of slow shocks and the magnetic field X-type line. These two slow shocks are shown to satisfy the <b>shock</b> <b>criteria</b> used by Feldman et al. (1987). The spacecraft first crosses a slow shock to enter the earthward flowing plasmasheet with velocity of about 440 km/s. The embedded magnetic field has a positive B(sub z) component. The spacecraft next enters a region of tailward plasma flow with speed approximately 670 km/s and an embedded negative B(sub z), indicating entry into the plasmasheet tailward of the X-line. These observed velocities are comparable to calculated velocities based on Rankine-Hugoniot conservation relationships. The spacecraft subsequently returns into the south tail lobe by crossing another slow shock. Coplanarity analyses shows that the two slow shocks have orientations consistent with that predicted by the Petschek reconnection model. We note that this event occurs during northward interplanetary magnetic fields. Thus, a magnetic stress built-up in the distant tail may be responsible for this reconnection process...|$|R

In an ischemic porcine cardiogenic shock model we investigated the release pattern of cardiacspecific miR- 208 b and liver-specific miR- 122 and assessed the effect of therapeutic hypothermia on their respective plasma levels. METHODS AND RESULTS:: Pigs were anesthetized and cardiogenic shock was induced by inflation of a PCI-balloon in the proximal LAD for 40 minutes followed by reperfusion. After fulfillment of the predefined <b>shock</b> <b>criteria,</b> the pigs were randomized to hypothermia (33 °C, n= 6) or normothermia (38 °C, n= 6). Circulating microRNAs were extracted from plasma and measured with quantitative real-time PCR. Tissue specificity was assessed by microRNA extraction from porcine tissues followed by quantitative real-time PCR. In vitro, the release of miR- 122 from a cultured hepatocyte cell line exposed to either hypoxia or acidosis was assessed by real-time PCR. miR- 122 {{was found to be}} highly liver specific whereas miR- 208 b was expressed exclusively in the heart. In the control group ischemic cardiogenic shock induced a 460. 000 -fold and a 63. 000 -fold increase in plasma levels of miR- 122 (p< 0. 05) and miR- 208 b (p< 0. 05), respectively. Therapeutic hypothermia significantly diminished the increase of miR- 122 compared to the normothermic group (p< 0. 005).

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the changes in}} the venoarterial carbon-dioxide gradient (V-a Pco(2)) and its prognostic value for survival of patients with severe sepsis and septic shock.

The patients were divided in two groups depending on whether or not they had been mechanically ventilated. Both groups of patients underwent interventions with an aim to achieve hemodynamic stability. Mechanical ventilation was applied in respiratory failure. Venoarterial carbon dioxide gradient was calculated from the difference between the partial pressure of arterial CO(2) and the partial pressure of mixed venous CO(2), which was measured with a pulmonary arterial Swan-Ganz catheter. The data were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, along with a calculation of the hazard ratios. [...] - RESULTS: There was a significant difference between non-ventilated and ventilated patients, with almost 4 -fold greater hazard ratio for lethal outcome in ventilated patients (3. 85; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 64 - 9. 03). Furthermore, the pattern of changes of many other variables was also different in these two groups (carbon dioxide-related variables, variables related to acid-base status, mean arterial pressure, systemic vascular resistance, lactate, body mass index, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II, Simplified Acute Physiology II Score, and Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment score). Pco(2) values (with a cut-off of 0. 8 kPa) were a significant predictor of lethal outcome in non-ventilated patients (P= 0. 015) but not in ventilated ones (P= 0. 270).

Employing the most recent <b>shock</b> <b>criteria,</b> we have examined 55 Antarctic and 24 non-Antarctic L chondrites in order to identify those which have been least affected by post-accretional shock. Six low-shock samples (those with shock grade less than S 4) of petrographic types L 3 -L 5 were selected from both populations and metallographic cooling rates were obtained following the technique of Willis and Goldstein. All non-Antarctic L 6 chondrites inspected were too heavily shocked to be included in this group. However, 4 shocked L 6 chondrites were analyzed in order to determine what effects shock may impose on metallographic cooling rates. Metallographic cooling rates were derived by analyzing the cores of taenite grains and then measuring the distance to the nearest grain edge. Taenites were identified using backscatter imaging on a Cameca SX- 50 electron microprobe. Using backscatter we were able to locate homogeneous, rust-free, nearly spherical grains. M-shaped profiles taken from grain traverses were also used to help locate the central portions of selected grains. All points which contained phosphorus above detection limits were discarded. Plots of cooling-rate data are summarized and data from the high-shock samples are presented. The lack of coherency of cooling rates for individual samples is indicative of heterogeneous cooling following shock. The data confirms the statement expressed by numerous workers that extreme care must be taken when selecting samples of L chondrites for cooling-rate studies. Data for the 6 non-Antarctic low-shock samples are also presented. The samples display a general trend in cooling rates. The lowest metamorphic grade yielded the slowest cooling rates and an increase in grade follows an increase in cooling rate. This is the opposite relationship to that predicted by the onion-shell model...|$|R
40|$|Sensitivity of shocks to data is a {{key point}} for fluid-structure and flutter control, and even more for sonic boom reduction. The linearized {{equations}} of fluids have Dirac masses {{and so it is}} not clear that the standard tools of optimal control apply to these. We show here that indeed great care have to be applied to find the linearized equations but that there is no such difficulties for control problems which do not involve explicitly the position of the <b>shock</b> in the <b>criteria...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Association {{rules are}} an {{important}} problem in data mining. Massively increasing volume of data in real life databases has motivated researchers to design novel and incremental algorithms for association rules mining. In this paper, we propose an incremental association rules mining algorithm that integrates <b>shocking</b> interestingness <b>criterion</b> {{during the process of}} building the model. A new interesting measure called shocking measure is introduced. One of the main features of the proposed approach is to capture the user background knowledge, which is monotonically augmented. The incremental model that reflects the changing data and the user beliefs is attractive {{in order to make the}} over all KDD process more effective and efficient. We implemented the proposed approach and experiment it with some public datasets and found the results quite promising.
