[...] The reaction in itself may look rather odd, as using the rule of thumb for a proceeding redox reaction, [...] Eooxidator−Eoreductor>0, this reaction fails. The quantity is below zero, so the reaction should not proceed. But the equilibrium constant=10^{(nox*nred/0.0591)*(Eooxidator−Eoreductor)} which in itself is easily derived from the Nernst equations for the specific half reactions. Using Eoox=EoCu2+/Cu+ = 0.15; nox = 1 for copper; Eored=EoI−/I2 = 0.52; nred = 2 for iodine for the reaction is 1.38*10−13.
