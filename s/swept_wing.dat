5|$|The Ilyushin Il-30 was a Soviet turbojet-powered {{tactical}} bomber {{designed as}} a higher-performance, <b>swept</b> <b>wing</b> version of the Ilyushin Il-28, in the late 1940s. Its thin wing and engine nacelles necessitated the use of tandem landing gear, the first Soviet aircraft to do so. It was apparently canceled before the prototype made its first flight, although sources disagree with this.|$|E

German scientists in WWII experimented with <b>swept</b> <b>wings.</b> Their research was applied on the MiG-15 and F-86 Sabre and bombers {{such as the}} B-47 Stratojet used <b>swept</b> <b>wings</b> which delay the onset of shock waves and reduce drag.|$|R

5|$|Aware of the {{problems}} revealed in flight tests, McDonnell reviewed the program and proposed a new development based on a more conventional design promising a Mach 0.9 capability, using alternatively a 35° <b>swept</b> <b>wing</b> and delta wing. McDonnell also considered adding a telescoping extension to the docking trapeze that would extend the device below the turbulent air under the mother ship. Before any further work on the trapeze, other modifications to the XF-85, or continued design studies on its follow-up could be carried out, the USAF canceled the XF-85 program on 24 October 1949.|$|E
5|$|The F-84 {{nomenclature}} can {{be somewhat}} confusing. The straight-wing F-84A to F-84E and F-84G models were called the Thunderjet. The F-84F Thunderstreak and RF-84F Thunderflash were different airplanes with swept wings. The XF-84H Thunderscreech (not its official name) was an experimental turboprop {{version of the}} F-84F. The F-84F <b>swept</b> <b>wing</b> version {{was intended to be}} a small variation of the normal Thunderjet with only a few different parts, so it kept the basic F-84 number. Production delays on the F-84F resulted in another order of the straight-wing version; this was the F-84G.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s, {{aeronautical}} designers {{looked to}} variable-geometry wing designs {{to gain the}} manoeuvrability and efficient cruise of straight wings {{with the speed of}} <b>swept</b> <b>wing</b> designs. The United Kingdom had cancelled the procurement of the TSR-2 and subsequent F-111K aircraft, and was still looking for a replacement for its Avro Vulcan and Blackburn Buccaneer strike aircraft. Britain and France had initiated the AFVG (Anglo French Variable Geometry) project in 1965, but this had ended with French withdrawal in 1967. Britain continued to develop a variable-geometry aircraft similar to the proposed AFVG, and sought new partners to achieve this.|$|E

5|$|Required {{to tender}} {{by the end}} of April 1947, work began on receipt of Specification B.35/46 at Avro, led by {{technical}} director Roy Chadwick and chief designer Stuart Davies; the type designation was Avro 698. It was obvious to the design team that conventional aircraft could not satisfy the specification; knowing little about high-speed flight and unable to glean much from the Royal Aircraft Establishment or the US, they investigated German Second World War <b>swept</b> <b>wing</b> research. The team estimated that an otherwise conventional aircraft, with a <b>swept</b> <b>wing</b> of 45°, would have doubled the weight requirement. Realising that swept wings increase longitudinal stability, the team deleted the tail (empennage) and the supporting fuselage, it thus became a swept-back flying wing with only a rudimentary forward fuselage and a fin (vertical stabilizer) at each wingtip. The estimated weight was now only 50% over the requirement; a delta shape resulted from reducing the wingspan and maintaining the wing area by filling in the space between the wingtips, which enabled the specification to be met. Though Alexander Lippisch is generally credited as the pioneer of the delta wing, Chadwick's team had followed its own logical design process. The initial design submission had four large turbojets stacked in pairs buried in the wing either side of the centreline. Outboard of the engines were two bomb-bays.|$|E
5|$|The Hunter is a {{conventional}} <b>swept</b> <b>wing</b> all-metal monoplane. The fuselage is of monocoque construction, with a removable rear section for engine maintenance. The engine is fed through triangular air intakes in the wing roots {{and has a}} single jetpipe {{in the rear of}} the fuselage. The mid-mounted wings have a leading edge sweep of 35° and slight anhedral, the tailplanes and fin are also swept. The Hunter's aerodynamic qualities were increasingly infringed upon by modifications in later production models, such as the addition of external containers to collect spent gun cartridges, underwing fuel tanks to increase range, leading edge extensions to resolve pitch control difficulties, and a large ventral air brake.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 1959, English Electric (EE) and Vickers {{worked on}} {{combining}} {{the best of}} both designs in order to put forward a joint design with a view to having an aircraft flying by 1963, while also working on merging the companies under the umbrella of the British Aircraft Corporation (along with Bristol Aircraft). EE had put forward a delta winged design and Vickers, a <b>swept</b> <b>wing</b> on a long fuselage. The EE wing, born of their greater supersonic experience, was judged superior to Vickers, while the Vickers fuselage was preferred. In effect, the aircraft would be built 50/50: Vickers the front half, EE the rear.|$|E

5|$|Another {{solution}} to the high-speed problem is the delta wing. The delta wing had {{many of the same}} advantages of the <b>swept</b> <b>wing</b> in terms of transonic and supersonic performance, but offered much more internal room and overall surface area. This provided more room for fuel, an important consideration given the inefficient early jet engines of the era, and the large wing area provided ample lift at high altitudes. The delta wing also enabled slower landings than swept wings in certain conditions. The disadvantages of the design were increased drag at lower speeds and altitudes, and especially higher drag while maneuvering. For the interceptor role these were minor concerns, as the aircraft would be spending most of its time flying in straight lines at high altitudes and speeds, mitigating these disadvantages.|$|E
5|$|Seeking better {{performance}} and fulfilment of the Air Ministry Specification E.38/46, Sydney Camm designed the Hawker P.1052, which {{was essentially a}} Sea Hawk outfitted with a 35-degree <b>swept</b> <b>wing.</b> Performing its first flight in 1948, the P.1052 demonstrated good performance and conducted several carrier trials, but was ultimately determined to not warrant further development into a production aircraft. As a private venture, Hawker proceeded to convert the second P.1052 prototype into the Hawker P.1081 with swept tailplanes, a revised fuselage, and a single jet exhaust at the rear. On 19June1950, the P.1081 conducted its maiden flight, and was promising enough to draw interest from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF); however, further development was stalled by difficulties with the engine's reheat. In 1951, the sole P.1081 prototype was lost in a crash.|$|E
5|$|The design {{proposed}} by Handley Page {{in response to}} B.35/46 was given the internal designation of HP.80. To achieve the required performance, Handley Page's aerodynamicist Dr. Gustav Lachmann and his deputy, Godfrey Lee developed a crescent-shaped <b>swept</b> <b>wing</b> for the HP.80; the sweep and chord of the wing decreased in three distinct steps from the root to the tip, to ensure a constant limiting Mach number across the entire wing and consequently a high cruise speed. Early work on the project included tailless aircraft designs, which would have used wing-tip vertical surfaces instead; however as the proposal matured a high-mounted, full tailplane was adopted instead. The profile and shaping of the crescent wing was subject to considerable fine-tuning and alterations throughout the early development stages, particularly to counter unfavourable pitching behaviour in flight.|$|E

5|$|The Eidgenössische Flugzeugwerke Emmen N-20 was a semi-tailless <b>swept</b> <b>wing</b> jet {{similar to}} the U.S. Navy's Vought F7U Cutlass with four engines mounted {{internally}} in the wings, fold-out canards to improve its aerodynamics at slow speeds, and a maximum designed airspeed of 1200km/h, a remarkable velocity for an aircraft of the early 1950s. The FFA P-16 was a single-engine straight-wing aircraft for which a contract for production of 100aircraft was awarded in 1958, but after the second crash of a pre-production model, the order was canceled. The aircraft had met all Swiss Air Force requirements for an STOL attack fighter capable of carrying heavy loads, and the crash was widely considered a pretext for the Swiss parliament to reverse itself. In addition, {{by the middle of}} 1958, influenced by NATO concepts, the LVK had redefined the Swiss doctrine of air power from close air support to counter-air operations. Further, the strategic concepts governing Swiss defense doctrine had shifted to a dynamic (mobile) defense that included execution of air missions beyond the Swiss border and the possibility of carrying nuclear weapons, for neither of which the P–16was suitable.|$|E

25|$|The Admiralty {{were not}} {{initially}} encouraging to Hawker's approaches, {{in part due}} {{the presence of the}} in-development jet-powered Supermarine Attacker aircraft. However, the service was intrigued by the long-range capability of the P.1040, {{as well as by the}} promise of increased power from the Nene engine. Thus, in May 1946, the Naval Staff authorised the manufacture of three prototypes and a further test specimen, one of these being the original prototype internally ordered by Hawker, in accordance with Naval Specification N.7/46. Hawker quickly found their development focus for the type being divided between the navy's P.1046 and the general-purpose P.1040, which was still hoped to be viable as an RAF fighter. The P.1040 would lead to the eventual development of the land-based <b>swept</b> <b>wing</b> Hawker Hunter fighter. <b>Swept</b> <b>wing</b> versions (P.1052 and P.1081) were built and experience gained with these were instrumental in developing the design of the Hunter.|$|E
