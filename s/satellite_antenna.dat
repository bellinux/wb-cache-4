The {{vehicles are}} maintained and deployed by Cisco employees during natural disasters and other public crises. The vehicles are self-contained and provide wired and wireless services including voice and radio interoperability, voice over IP, network-based video surveillance and secured high-definition video-conferencing for leaders and first responders in crisis areas with up to 3 Mbit/s of bandwidth (up and down) via a 1.8-meter <b>satellite</b> <b>antenna.</b>|$|E
25|$|Swanson and Acaba {{began the}} second spacewalk at 16:51 UTC. They {{loosened}} bolts, installed foot restraints and prepared tools {{so that the}} STS-127 spacewalkers could more easily change out the Port 6 truss batteries later this year. On the Japanese Kibo laboratory they installed a second Global Positioning <b>Satellite</b> <b>antenna.</b> They photographed areas of radiator panels extended from the Port 1 and Starboard 1 trusses and reconfigured connectors at a patch panel on the Zenith 1 truss that power Control Moment Gyroscopes. After struggling with a pin that kept an Unpressurized Cargo Carrier Attachment System (UCCAS) from fully deploying, they tied UCCAS safely in place. The spacewalk ended at 23:21 UTC, for a time of six hours and thirty minutes.|$|E

2500|$|The PT Cruiser was updated for 2006 {{to include}} {{scalloped}} headlights, a revised grille no longer extending below the [...] "bumper", new lower front fascia which eliminated the patented brake cooling ducts and available round fog lamps and redesigned taillights. Interior updates included a revised interior with an updated dash with an analog {{clock in the}} center stack. The audio system featured a line-in jack for MP3 players integrated into the dash. Features such as satellite radio, a premium sound system by Boston Acoustics with external amplifier and subwoofer, and U Connect hands-free Bluetooth for compatible cell phones also became available in 2006. The standard audio system now included an A/M-F/M stereo with single-disc CD player and 3.5-millimeter auxiliary audio input jack with six speakers, replacing a cassette player and four speakers. The turbocharged 2.4L four-cylinder engine was available in [...] or [...] "High-Output" [...] versions. A [...] "Mopar" [...] cruise control unit became available as an after market unit on 2007 models. Also in 2007, Chrysler dealers were permitted to order vehicles with separate options (un-bundled options from option packages) such as anti-lock brakes and Side Impact Airbags. Sirius Satellite Radio also became an option that could be installed as a dealer option with a factory appearance (i.e. roof mount <b>satellite</b> <b>antenna).</b>|$|E
