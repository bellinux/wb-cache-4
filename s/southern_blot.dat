25|$|The <b>Southern</b> <b>blot</b> {{technique}} is laborious, and requires {{large amounts of}} undegraded sample DNA. Also, Karl Brown's original technique looked at many minisatellite loci at the same time, increasing the observed variability, but {{making it hard to}} discern individual alleles (and thereby precluding paternity testing). These early techniques have been supplanted by PCR-based assays.|$|E
25|$|The {{separated}} fragments {{are then}} transferred to a nitrocellulose or nylon filter; this procedure is called a <b>Southern</b> <b>blot.</b> The DNA fragments within the blot are permanently fixed to the filter, and the DNA strands are denatured. Radiolabeled probe molecules are then added that are complementary to sequences in the genome that contain repeat sequences. These repeat sequences tend to vary in length among different individuals and are called variable number tandem repeat sequences or VNTRs. The probe molecules hybridize to DNA fragments containing the repeat sequences and excess probe molecules are washed away. The blot is then exposed to an X-ray film. Fragments of DNA that have bound to the probe molecules appear as fluoresent bands on the film.|$|E
25|$|Mutations in Oa1 {{have been}} well {{characterized}} and studied using various techniques like <b>southern</b> <b>blot</b> analyses, single-strand conformation polymorphism and sequence analysis. Most of these mutations {{have been reported to}} be occurring in the N-terminus and few in the trans-membrane regions but very rarely in the much conserved cytoplasmic C-terminus. Populations belonging to different ethnic groups have been extensively analyzed and a database has been created recording the details of mutations related to OA1. A total of 25 missense, 2 nonsense, 9 frameshift, and 5 splicing mutations have been reported till date. In addition to these mutations, there also occur several deletions in one or many of the exons of Oa1 gene, especially exon 2. These deletions are presumed to be because of unequal crossing-over due to the presence of flanking Alu regions. In some cases, the entire Oa1 gene is deleted along with other contiguous genes. Many different polymorphisms have also been detected, mainly in intron 1.|$|E

RESULTS: DNA extraction from the cytologic material was performed in all cases (N= 3 D 15).

2500|$|RFLPs {{can be used}} to {{determine}} the origin and mechanism involved with Polysomy X and other chromosome heteromorphisms or chromosomes that differ in size, shape, or staining properties. [...] Restriction enzymes cut DNA at a specific site and the DNA fragments that are left are called restriction fragment length polymorphisms, or RFLPs. RFLP also aids in the identification of the Huntingtin (HTT) gene which is predictive of an adult-onset autosomal disorder called Huntington's disease (HD). Mutations in chromosome 4 are able to be visualized when RFLP is used in conjunction with <b>Southern</b> <b>blot</b> analysis.|$|E

Experiments have shown that of twenty-six species, only three species that can be infected by P. philippinensis show little infection by P. sacchari. [...] This difference is minimalized when comparing host ranges of isolates of the same species. [...] One isolate of P. philippinensis can infect seven more than another. [...] There is {{no significant difference in the}} number of nuclei per spore for these two species, and they have almost identical banding patterns when analysed through a <b>Southern</b> <b>blot.</b> [...] When looking at their genomes, using simple sequence repeats as markers, there is shown to be lack of uniqueness between P. philippinensis and P. sacchari. [...] Because of these similarities, many scientists question that initial distinction that Weston placed on them in 1920.|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} few years, {{application}} of the PCR to the detection of herpes simplex virus (HSV) DNA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with encephalitis and meningitis has become standard laboratory practice. However, from an operational perspective, the true diagnostic value of PCR in this setting {{is yet to be}} realized because most laboratories subject the amplification products to lengthy probe hybridization procedures by <b>Southern</b> <b>blotting.</b> As alternatives to <b>Southern</b> <b>blotting,</b> we evaluated colorimetric microtiter plate (MTP) systems from ViroMed Laboratories, Inc. (PrimeCapture), CPG, Inc. (Quanti-PATH), and Incstar Corp. (GEN-ETI-K), in addition to a system developed at the Mayo Clinic with the PCR ELISA system (Boehringer Mannheim Corp.). We tested PCR products from 86 clinical CSF specimens submitted to our Molecular Microbiology Laboratory. The CSF specimens used had to have sufficient volume for comparative analysis. By conventional <b>Southern</b> <b>blotting</b> methods, 54 were positive and 32 were negative for HSV DNA. Compared with <b>Southern</b> <b>blotting,</b> the sensitivity and specificity were 63. 0 and 100. 0 %, respectively, for the PrimeCapture system, 98. 2 and 96. 9 %, respectively, for the Quanti-PATH system, 98. 2 and 100. 0 %, respectively, for the GEN-ETI-K system, and 100. 0 and 96. 9 %, respectively, for the Mayo system. All four MTP systems had turnaround times 12 to 24 h less than that for <b>Southern</b> <b>blotting.</b> There {{were no significant differences in}} costs or technologist time between the Mayo system and <b>Southern</b> <b>blotting.</b> Other features of the Mayo system include type-specific genotypic identification of HSV and the potential for determination of drug resistance by DNA sequencing.

40|$|<b>Southern</b> <b>blotting</b> is {{a widely}} used method of {{determining}} loss of chromosomal alleles in tumors, but cannot be used to analyze small biopsies and most fixed, embedded tissues. These problems preclude analysis of many surgical neuropathology specimens. We have employed a polymerase chain reaction assay for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) based on the (CA) n dinucleotide repeat polymorphisms found in abundance throughout the human genome. We compared this method to conventional <b>Southern</b> <b>blotting</b> in detecting LOH on chromosome 10 in gliomas. From tissue sections of 14 paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed gliomas, we amplified the (CA) n repeat D 10 S 89 locus and compared (CA) n repeat patterns between tumor DNA and constitutional DNA. Loss of one chromosome 10 (CA) n repeat allele was seen in informative glioblastomas that showed allelic loss by <b>Southern</b> <b>blotting,</b> but not in gliomas that had maintained both alleles. The (CA) n repeat method {{can be applied to}} small and fixed, embedded specimens, is rapid and simple to perform, and uses highly polymorphic probes. We suggest that (CA) n repeats are a less exclusive and more rapid means of studying LOH in brain tumors than <b>Southern</b> <b>blotting,</b> and will provide further mapping data for the identification of tumor suppressor genes integral to glial tumorigenesis...|$|R

Instead, a mixture containing the molecule to be detected is applied directly on a membrane as a dot, and then is spotted through circular templates directly onto the membrane or paper substrate. This differs from the western blot because protein samples are not separated electrophoretically. This is then followed by detection by either nucleotide probes (for a northern blot and <b>southern</b> <b>blot)</b> or antibodies (for a western blot).|$|E
