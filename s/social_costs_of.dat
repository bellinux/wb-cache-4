The economic rationale for this pricing scheme is based on the externalities or <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> road transport, such as air pollution, noise, traffic accidents, environmental and urban deterioration, and the extra costs and delays imposed by traffic congestion upon other drivers when additional users enter a congested road.|$|E

5|$|For the {{purposes}} of analysis, {{it is possible to}} separate efficiency (achieving a given objective at lowest cost) and equity (fairness). Economists generally agree that to regulate emissions efficiently, all polluters need to face the full costs of their actions (that is, the full marginal <b>social</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> their actions). Regulation of emissions that is applied only to one economic sector or region drastically reduces the efficiency of efforts to reduce global emissions. There is, however, no scientific consensus over how to share {{the costs and benefits of}} reducing future climate change (mitigation of climate change), or the costs and benefits of adapting to any future climate change (see also economics of global warming).|$|E

50|$|The <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> carbon (SCC) is an {{aggregate}} {{measure of the}} impacts of climate change.

Different GHGs have different <b>social</b> <b>costs.</b> For example, due to their greater physical capacity to trap infrared radiation, HFCs have a considerably higher <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> per tonne <b>of</b> emission than carbon dioxide.

40|$|Environmental {{regulations}} that are passed by governmental agencies {{must ensure that}} {{the benefit of the}} regulation outweighs the burden. The failure for the benefit to outweigh the burden will result in the nullification of environmentally beneficial regulations. The methodology to measure the environmental impact of a regulation is difficult to understand and in some cases highly controversial. One example of this is the use <b>of</b> the <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> carbon. The <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> carbon is used to measure carbon reduction. The use <b>of</b> the <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> carbon can help regulations succeed cost-benefit scrutiny, which would invalidate the regulation. The Department of Energy used the <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> carbon when it created its new regulations for energy efficiency standards regarding commercialized refrigerators. In Zero Zone, Inc. v. U. S. Department of Energy, the Seventh Circuit upheld the Department of Energy 2 ̆ 7 s new energy efficiency standards for commercialized refrigerators. The Seventh Circuit also upheld that the Department of Energy has the requisite authority to implement the standards. The most noteworthy part of the opinion is the Seventh Circuit upholding the use <b>of</b> the <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> carbon in the cost-benefit analysis performed by the Department of Energy. The Seventh Circuit was correct in upholding the Department of Energy 2 ̆ 7 s commercial refrigeration regulations, the Department 2 ̆ 7 s authority to do so, and the use <b>of</b> the <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> carbon in the Department 2 ̆ 7 s cost-benefit analysis. The Department of Energy has clear authority from Congress to implement these regulations. Additionally, a Chevron analysis further supports the Department 2 ̆ 7 s authority to do so.

25|$|The {{economic}} policy stance currently dominant {{around the world}} uses unemployment as a policy tool to control inflation; when cost pressures rise, the standard monetary policy {{carried out by the}} monetary authority (central bank) tightens interest rates, creating a buffer stock of unemployed people, which reduces wage demands, and ultimately inflation. When inflationary expectations subside, these people will get their jobs back. In Marxian terms, the unemployed serve as a reserve army of labor.

2500|$|The {{economic}} {{problem with}} {{climate change is}} that the emitters of greenhouse gases (GHGs) do not face the full cost implications of their actions (IMF, 2008, p.6). There are costs that emitters do face, e.g., {{the costs of the}} fuel being used, but there are other costs that are not necessarily included in the price of a good or service. These other costs are called external costs (Halsnæs et al.., 2007). They are [...] "external" [...] because they are costs that the emitter does not face. External costs may affect the welfare of others. In the case of climate change, GHG emissions affect the welfare of people living in the future, as well as affecting the natural environment (Toth et al., 2001). These external costs can be estimated and converted in a common (monetary) unit. The argument for doing this is that these external costs can then be added to the private costs that the emitter faces. In doing this, the emitter faces the full (<b>social)</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> their actions (IMF, 2008, p.9).|$|E

We show {{the results of a}} range of sensitivity analyses, focusing on the impact of carbon dioxide fertilization. Ignored in previous studies <b>of</b> the <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> greenhouse gas emissions, carbon dioxide fertilization has a positive effect at the margin, but only for carbon dioxide. Because of this, the ratio <b>of</b> the <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> a greenhouse gas to that of carbon dioxide (the global damage potential) is higher - that is, previous papers underestimated the importance of reducing non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emissions. When leaving out carbon dioxide fertilization, our estimate <b>of</b> the <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> methane is comparable to previous estimates. Our estimate of the global damage potential of methane is close to the estimates of the global warming potential because discounting roughly cancels carbon dioxide fertilization. Our estimate <b>of</b> the <b>social</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> nitrous oxide is higher than previous estimates, also when omitting carbon dioxide fertilization. This is because, in FUND, vulnerability to climate change falls over time (with development) while in the long run carbon dioxide is a more potent greenhouse gas than nitrous oxide. Our estimate of the global damage potential of nitrous oxide is larger than the global warming potential because of carbon dioxide fertilization, discounting, and rising atmospheric concentrations of both gases.
