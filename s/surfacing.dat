5|$|The Kidd/Stubbs {{model has}} four serial compartments, {{each with a}} half time of {{approximately}} 21 minutes. Allowable <b>surfacing</b> supersaturation ratios for the initial two compartments are taken as 1.92 and 1.73, while the gas concentration {{in the last two}} compartments is not considered in the computation.|$|E
5|$|A {{decompression}} {{algorithm is}} used to calculate the decompression stops needed for a particular dive profile {{to reduce the risk of}} decompression sickness occurring after <b>surfacing</b> at the end of a dive. The algorithm can be used to generate decompression schedules for a particular dive profile, decompression tables for more general use, or be implemented in dive computer software.|$|E

5|$|A typical {{hyperbaric}} oxygen {{treatment schedule}} is the US Navy Table 6, which {{provides for a}} standard treatment of 3 to 5 periods of 20 minutes of oxygen breathing at 60fsw (18msw) followed by 2 to 4 periods of 60 minutes at 30fsw (9msw) before <b>surfacing.</b> Air breaks are taken between oxygen breathing {{to reduce the risk}} of oxygen toxicity.|$|E

However, she is subsequently attacked on {{a nearby}} bridge and repeatedly stabbed in the abdomen by the Waif, {{in the guise of}} an elderly woman. Arya pushes the Waif away, and barely escapes by jumping off the bridge and swimming away underwater. After <b>surfacing,</b> she is then left stumbling through the streets, critically wounded.|$|E
5|$|During the 17th century, {{the ground}} floor of the keep– made of {{hardened}} gravel– was dug up, probably to reuse for <b>surfacing</b> roads or pathways. The apartments in the forebuilding were abandoned and this part of the keep fell into decay as well. In 1644, the lands surrounding the castle were disparked, bringing an end to Castle Rising Chase. In 1705 stone was stripped from the castle to help repair a nearby sluice gate.|$|E

5|$|Oxygen {{first aid}} {{has been used}} as an {{emergency}} treatment for diving injuries for years. If given within the first four hours of <b>surfacing,</b> it increases the success of recompression therapy as well as decreasing the number of recompression treatments required. Most fully closed-circuit rebreathers can deliver sustained high concentrations of oxygen-rich breathing gas and {{could be used as a}} means of supplying oxygen if dedicated equipment is not available.|$|E
5|$|The {{emperor penguin}} {{is a social}} animal in its nesting and its {{foraging}} behaviour; birds hunting together may coordinate their diving and <b>surfacing.</b> Individuals may be active day or night.

40|$|Theoretical {{analysis}} and molecular dynamics simulations {{were conducted to}} study systematically <b>surface</b> eigen-displacement and <b>surface</b> Poisson's ratios of solids, which play essential roles in <b>surface</b> energy, <b>surface</b> strain and <b>surface</b> stress. Face-centered cubic (0 0 1) Au thin films were taken as typical examples to illustrate the physical picture. The <b>surface</b> eigen-displacement is a critical <b>surface</b> strain at the equilibrium state after normal relaxation and thus an intrinsic <b>surface</b> property. <b>Surface</b> Poisson's ratios are also intrinsic <b>surface</b> properties. Combining <b>surface</b> eigen-displacement and <b>surface</b> Poisson's ratios with <b>surface</b> eigen-stress and <b>surface</b> tangential elastic constants lays foundations of <b>surface</b> elasticity of solids.

50|$|When {{a crystal}} of a binary oxide is cleaved to {{generate}} two new <b>surfaces,</b> each solid’s charge remains neutral. However, {{the structure of}} the two newly created <b>surfaces</b> {{may or may not be}} the same. If the structures are identical, the <b>surface</b> will be dipoleless and is considered a nonpolar <b>surface.</b> If the structures are different, the <b>surface</b> will have a strong dipole and is considered a polar <b>surface.</b> Examples of nonpolar <b>surfaces</b> include the rocksalt (100) <b>surface,</b> the rutile (100), (110) and (001) <b>surfaces</b> and the pervoskite (100) <b>surface.</b> An example of a polar <b>surface</b> is the rocksalt (111) <b>surface.</b> In general, a polar <b>surface</b> is less stable than a nonpolar <b>surface</b> because a dipole moment increases the <b>surface</b> Gibbs energy. Also, oxygen polar <b>surfaces</b> are more stable than metal polar <b>surfaces</b> because oxygen ions are more polarizable, which lowers the <b>surface</b> energy.|$|R

5|$|U-6 was {{commissioned}} into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 1 July 1910, with Linienschiffsleutnant Georg Ritter von Trapp in command. Over {{the next three}} years she served primarily as a training boat, making as many as ten training cruises per month. On 7 November 1911, she hosted a Norwegian naval delegation that inspected her. On 26 June 1912, U-6 was accidentally rammed by the submarine tender Pelikan while <b>surfacing</b> after a deep diving trial.|$|E
5|$|Elephant endotheliotropic {{herpesvirus}}es (EEHV) or Elephantid herpesvirus 1' {{is a type}} of herpesvirus, {{which can}} cause a highly fatal hemorrhagic disease when transmitted to young Asian elephants. In African elephants, related forms of these viruses, which have been identified in wild populations, are generally benign, occasionally <b>surfacing</b> to cause small growths or lesions. However, some types of EEHV can cause a highly fatal disease in Asian elephants, which kills up to 80% of severely affected individuals. The disease can be treated with the rapid application of antiviral drugs, but this has only been effective in around a third of cases.|$|E

5|$|Hard <b>surfacing</b> {{of roads}} {{in part of}} the Kettle Creek {{watershed}} began in 1930 to 1938. The Alvin R. Bush Dam {{was built on the}} creek in the late 1950s to protect against flooding. The creek was the subject of an Operation Scarlift study from 1970 to 1972. A USGS gauge was installed on the stream in 1972. The Kettle Creek Watershed Association (also known as the KWCA) was founded in the late 1990s. The creek became the third Home Rivers initiative of Trout Unlimited in 1998. The main industries in the Kettle Creek watershed in the 21st century are tourism, agriculture, and lumbering.|$|E
5|$|In 2002 a 1.9-mile (3-kilometre) safe cycle route, the Chew Lake West Green Route, {{was opened}} along the B3114 {{on the western}} part of the lake. It forms part of the Padstow to Bristol West Country Way, National Cycle Network Route 3. It has {{all-weather}} <b>surfacing,</b> providing a smooth off-road facility for ramblers, mobility-challenged visitors and cyclists of all abilities. It was funded by Bath and North East Somerset Council with the support of Sustrans and the Chew Valley Recreational Trail Association. Minor roads around the lake are also frequently used by cyclists.|$|E
5|$|Like most of McLachlan's albums, <b>Surfacing</b> was {{recorded}} at Marchand's Wild Sky Studios in Morin-Heights, Quebec.

McLachlan played piano, acoustic guitar and electric guitar and Marchand played keyboards, bass and a drum machine {{as well as providing}} background vocals. The other musicians on the album were Jim Creeggan on upright bass, Yves Desrosiers on guitar, musical saw, lap steel guitar and slide bass, Brian Minato on bass and electric guitar, Michel Pepin on electric guitar and Ashwin Sood (whom McLachlan married in 1997) on percussion and drums.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, the UERL's GNP tube railway {{was under}} construction, <b>surfacing</b> west of West Kensington and {{entering}} two terminal platforms {{on the north}} side of the District's Hammersmith station. A new station, Barons Court, was built with two island platforms, one for each railway. As there was space at Lillie Bridge Depot after the District had moved to Mill Hill Park, the GNP took over part of the site for its depot. Barons Court opened 9 October 1905 and the tube railway opened as the Piccadilly line on 15 December 1906.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, the {{failures}} at Sydney Harbour and Diego Suarez {{demonstrated that the}} improvements to the midget submarines made after Pearl Harbor had not increased the overall impact of the midget program. The modifications had various effects. The ability to man and deploy the midgets while the mother ships were submerged prevented the Army coastal radars from detecting the mother submarines. However, the midgets were still difficult to control, unstable, and prone to <b>surfacing</b> or diving uncontrollably. These manoeuvrability issues contributed to M-14s entanglement in the anti-submarine net, and the repeated detection of M-21 and M-24.|$|E
5|$|Some on-street {{track was}} laid {{in a special}} {{foundation}} with cobbled road <b>surfacing</b> designed to be sympathetic with the style of Edinburgh streets but was removed in many places due to objections from cyclists. The trams are powered by overhead cables attached to purpose-built poles or mounted {{on the sides of}} buildings. Nine electrical sub-stations were planned for the line to Newhaven, both underground and above-ground but only five were built after the line was truncated at York Place.|$|E
50|$|A minimal <b>surface</b> of {{revolution}} is a subtype of minimal <b>surface.</b> A minimal <b>surface</b> is defined {{not as a}} <b>surface</b> of minimal area, but as a <b>surface</b> with a mean curvature of 0. Since a mean curvature of 0 is a necessary condition of a <b>surface</b> of minimal area, all minimal <b>surfaces</b> {{of revolution}} are minimal <b>surfaces,</b> but not all minimal <b>surfaces</b> are minimal <b>surfaces</b> of revolution. As a point forms a circle when rotated about an axis, finding the minimal <b>surface</b> of revolution is equivalent to finding the minimal <b>surface</b> passing through two circular wireframes. A physical realization of a minimal <b>surface</b> of revolution is soap film stretched between two parallel circular wires: the soap film naturally takes on the shape with least <b>surface</b> area.|$|R
