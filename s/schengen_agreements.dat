The European Union is only open to a [...] "European" [...] state which respects the principles of [...] "human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, {{the rule of law}} and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities". Countries whose territory is wholly outside the European continent cannot therefore apply. Nor can any country without fully democratic political institutions which ensure standards of [...] "pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail". Article 50 says any member state can withdraw in accord [...] "with its own constitutional requirements", by negotiated [...] "arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union". This indicates that the EU is not entitled to demand a withdrawal, and that member states should follow constitutional procedures, for example, through Parliament or a codified constitutional document. Once article 50 is triggered, there is a two-year time limit to complete negotiations, a procedure which would leave a seceding member without any bargaining power in negotiations, because the costs of having no trade treaty would be proportionally greater to the individual state than the remaining EU bloc. Article 7 allows member states to be suspended for a [...] "clear risk of a serious breach" [...] of values in article 2 (for example, democracy, equality, human rights) with a four-fifths vote of the Council of the European Union, and the consent of the Parliament. Within the treaties' framework, sub-groups of member states may make further rules that only apply to those member states who want them. For example, the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Agreements</b> of 1985 and 1990 allow people to move without any passport or ID checks anywhere in the EU, but did not apply to the UK or Ireland. More recently, during the Eurozone crisis, the Treaty Establishing the European Stability Mechanism 2012 and the Treaty on Stability, Co-ordination and Governance 2012 (the [...] "Fiscal Compact") were adopted only for member states who had the Euro (i.e. not Denmark, Sweden, the UK, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Croatia, Romania or Bulgaria). This required, among other things, a pledge to balance the government budget and limit structural deficits to 0.5 per cent of GDP, with fines for non-compliance. The jurisdiction for these rules remains with the Court of Justice.|$|E

50|$|The most {{pressing}} concerns of ordinary Europeans, {{such as their}} legal and personal security, immigration, and fraud prevention, were all dealt with in other chapters of the Treaty. In particular, the EU became responsible for legislating on immigration, civil law or civil procedure, insofar as this {{is necessary for the}} free movement of persons within the EU. At the same time, intergovernmental co-operation was intensified in the police and criminal justice field so that Member States should be able to coordinate their activities more effectively.

50|$|The Treaty of Paris (1951) {{establishing}} the European Coal and Steel Community established {{a right to}} free movement for workers in these industries and the Treaty of Rome (1957) provided a right for the free movement of workers within the European Economic Community.

It also clarifies procedural issues, and it strengthens the rights of family members of European citizens using the freedom of movement.According to the official site of the European Parliament, the explanation of the freedom of workers goes as follows:Freedom of movement and residence for persons in the EU is the cornerstone of Union citizenship, which was established by the Treaty of Maastricht in 1992. Its practical implementation in EU law, however, has not been straightforward. It first involved the gradual phasing out, of internal borders under the <b>Schengen</b> <b>agreements,</b> initially in just a handful of Member States. Today, the provisions governing the free movement of persons are laid down in Directive 2004/38/EC on the right of EU citizens and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States. However, the implementation of this directive continues to face many obstacles.|$|E

Given these general assumptions about the role of differentiation in the framework of the Communities this paper analyzes different models of flexible integration, assess their potential for offering a real alternative to the traditional approach of the integration process and gives an insight into the consequences of such an approach for the member states and their interactions in this new context. </p...|$|E

However, real difficulties have affected the {{free movement}} of Europe's citizens. Closely associated with the building of the Internal Market it seems to have suffered the loss of impetus by the latter and also the serious consequences of the crisis. It is also struggling due to rising concern about external migratory pressure and the enlargement. In particular this is fuelling fear of social dumping. Difficulties have to be identified in order to provide pragmatic answers without bringing into question one of the founding principles of the European Union.

Reforming <b>Schengen</b> <b>agreements</b> was, beyond their temporary suspension, a major response to the Lampedusa crisis. The empirical analysis encompasses both frame and critical discourse analysis. The questions are a) whether the most read newspapers in Spain (Abc, El Mundo, El País, El Periódico, and La Vanguardia) framed people coming to Europe as asylum-seekers/refugees (victim-frame) or as immigrants (intruder-frame, i. e. conflict-frame), b) whether the five of them did it in the same way, and c) whether frame-shifts took place over the four-periods time.

40|$|Traditional {{theories}} of integration {{such as the}} optimum currency area approach attribute a prominent role to international labour mobility in coping with relative economic fluctuations between countries. However, recent studies on international migration have overlooked the role of short-run factors in explaining international migration flows. This paper aims to fill that gap. We first derive a model of optimal migration choice based on {{an extension of the}} traditional Random Utility Model. Our model predicts that an improvement in the economic activity in a potential destination country relative to any origin country may trigger some additional migration flows on top of the impact exerted by long-run factors such as the wage differential or the bilateral distance. Compiling a dataset with annual gross migration flows between 30 developed origin and destination countries over the 1980 - 2010 period, we empirically test the magnitude of the effect of short-run factors on bilateral flows. Our econometric results indicate that relative aggregate fluctuations and employment rates affect the intensity of bilateral migration flows. We also provide compelling evidence that the <b>Schengen</b> <b>agreements</b> and the introduction of the euro significantly raised the international mobility of workers between the member countries...|$|E

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{question}} of how migration has developed into a security issue in western Europe and how the European integration process is implicated in it. Since the 1980 s, the political construction of migration increasingly referred to the destabilizing effects of migration on domestic integration and to the dangers for public order it implied. The spill over of the internal market into a European internal security question mirrors these domestic developments at the European level. The Third Pillar on Justice and Home Affairs, the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Agreements,</b> and the Dublin Convention most visibly indicate that the European integration process is implicated {{in the development of a}} restrictive migration policy and the social construction of migration into a security question. However, the political process of connecting migration to criminal and terrorist abuses of the internal market does not take place in isolation. It is related to a wider politicization in which immigrants and asylum-seekers are portrayed as a challenge to the protection of national identity and welfare provisions. Moreover, supporting the political construction of migration as a security issue impinges on and is embedded in the politics of belonging in western Europe. It is an integral part of the wider technocratic and political process in which professional agencies – such as the police and customs – and political agents – such as social movements and political parties – debate and decide the criteria for legitimate membership of west European societies. ...|$|E
40|$|The Area of Freedom, Security and Justice (AFSJ) touches upon two {{fundamental}} issues: {{on the one}} hand the national sovereignty and the State’s capacity to control and to manage its territory and its population, {{and on the other hand}} the protection of fundamental human rights and civil liberties. Thus, the balance between liberty and security is the core of the AFSJ. Scholars have argued that the lack of parlia-mentary accountability and control of home affairs policies has led to an insuffi-cient standard of human protection. However, recent developments in this area bought by the treaty of Lisbon conferred to national parliaments a special role in AFSJ polices (Article 69, Title V of TFEU). They should ensure that the legisla-tive initiative in relation to judicial cooperation in criminal matters and to police cooperation (Chapter 4 and 5) comply with the principle of subsidiarity. The ques-tion that this paper tries to answer is to what extent the involvement of national parliaments in European policies brings a more humanitarian approach to the AFSJ? To do so, we rely on two theoretical concepts: that of frame and that of parliamentary scrutiny and one case study: the reform of the <b>Schengen</b> <b>agreements</b> proposed by the European Commission in September 20111. In a comparative perspective we analyse how the French and the Italian parliamentarians scruti-nized the reform mentioned above and what role do they play in the decision-making process...|$|E
40|$|This paper asks why Iceland had until July 2009 {{chosen to}} {{participate}} in the European project through the EEA and <b>Schengen</b> <b>agreements</b> but not with full membership in the EU. It analyses if and how ideas on the Icelandic nation and its sovereignty affects the stance Icelandic politicians have taken towards the European project. Icelanders ’ struggle for independence in the 19 th century created a special kind of nationalism which gives prominence to the sovereignty of the nation as a whole. Economically, however, Iceland feels the same need as other European states {{to participate in}} European co-operation, which can explain its membership in the EEA. The agreement brings Iceland into the European single market, but at a cost: Iceland has de-facto agreed to adopt the EU’s legislation within the boundaries of the agreement, and thus a transfer of decision making and domestic governmental power to the EU. This dilemma, between economic interests {{on the one hand and}} ideas on the sovereignty of the Icelandic nation on the other, has created a kind of a rift between the emphasis on the free and sovereign nation and the reality Iceland is faced with in the co-operation. The inheritance of the independent struggle still directs the discourse Icelandic politicians use in the debate on Europe. A strong emphasis on sovereignty has become the foundation on which Icelandic politics rests. Participation in EU’s supra-national institutions falls, in a way, outside the framework of Icelandic political discourse, which highlights Iceland’s sovereignty and stresses an everlasting independence struggle...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to explore Germany's border policies {{in the face of}} a European-level intergovernmental regime for border-related policies: The <b>Schengen</b> <b>Agreements</b> (1985 - 1995) 1. The results are twofold: The border retains an essential role for state authorities for security provision since European solutions were only sought to nationally understood security threats. Yet a new principle of internal and external borders emerged in which competence for border policies was moved to the European level and in which the interests of other states have to be taken into account as if they were the state's own. The thesis analyses the rationale of Germany for advocating such a transfer of hitherto essentially national competence to an intergovernmental mechanism. The motive is identified in a combination of national (internal) security interests and current interpretations of historical experiences. A socialisation of Western Germany into European institutions led it to seek a European-level solution. In this context, the changes of the political landscape in 1989 had profound implications for the debate about borders. A changed security situation led to a focus on soft security matters which were connected to deep-seated uncertainties of the possible threats emanating from an unstable Eastern Europe. Germany's relationship with its eastern neighbours had to be clarified (which included the recognition of the Oder-Neisse border), and it had to assure the Schengen partners of its ability to guard the eastern Schengen border. The thesis concludes that Germany was one of the driving forces in the Schengen negotiations. From the start, Germany advocated a set of compensatory measures which were to counteract the identified loss of the security function of the border against international crime and illegal immigration. In parallel, it also implemented significant additional changes on the national level. The resulting Schengen system established a link between freedom and security which was retained in subsequent EU arrangements...|$|E
40|$|The European {{integration}} process raises interesting {{challenges to the}} conceptualization and the exercise of citizenship in a multinational cosmopolitan context. Certainly, the current institutional architecture of the European Union (EU) faces tough criticism. On the one hand, anti-European parties and Euro-skeptics, by means of Euro-exit initiatives and on nationalist grounds, challenge {{the very existence of}} the European integration project. On the other hand, federalist and pro-European intellectuals often complain that the EU has not gone far enough with respect to the democratic, the civic and/or the social integration of the Union. In spite of such criticism, the European {{integration process}} has given rise to a novel and singular form of citizenship: the so-called dual form of citizenship. The European dual form of citizenship entails a combination of national and supranational civic membership. EU citizenship –which is automatically conferred on every EU citizen by the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU–, does not replace, but complements national citizenship. In this regard, it implies the automatic expansion and improvement of citizens’ rights and opportunities –for example, the right to vote and stand as a candidate in municipal and European Parliament elections and the right to move and reside freely within the EU–. Moreover, EU treaties (now including the Chapter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, legally binding on the supranational institutions and on national governments since 1 December 2009) and institutions such as the Court of Justice of the European Union, contribute to the enhancement of the legal and judicial mechanisms for the protection of basic rights. In spite of these benefits and achievements, the democratic shortcomings of the EU’s decision-making architecture encourage citizens’ distrust of the EU. In addition, one basic goal and achievement of the European integration project, which is citizens’ mobility within the EU, is facing serious setbacks. Indeed, the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Agreements</b> allow for exceptions which are too easily employed by the member states in order strengthen their borders controls and restrict intra-European mobility; which has just intensified {{as a consequence of the}} economic crisis, and more recently, the “refugees crisis”. The focus of my paper is on the conceptual challenge that the European integration project raises to the modern idea of citizenship. One of the basic conditions for the exercise of the democratic citizenship has traditionally been national membership. Yet, this has just been challenged by the European integration process and the dual form of citizenship that it has guaranteed.

40|$|The latest {{expansion}} of the EU towards the East has again modified its borders, showing once again the intangibility and flexibility of the latter. The very definition of border acquires different meanings depending on which theme is being discussed: an impenetrable barrier against migratory flows {{and the introduction of}} goods, transforming itself into a strainer for the exporting of national products. The new Internal Affairs Commissioner for the EU, Rocco Buttiglione, affirms on the one hand that migratory flows cannot be blocked manu militari, although he also believes that Europe decides who can enter and who cannot. Even within Europe, and despite the <b>Schengen</b> <b>Agreements,</b> borders are taking shape in concrete situations, reminding us that their disappearance is not definitive. We should differentiate between natural borders and those erected by man; in reference to the latter we will focus on walls, such as the one no longer standing in Berlin or that illegally erected by Israel in the Occupied Territories, scoffing at the international bodies dedicated to the defense of human rights and freedoms. In reference to natural borders, in direct opposition to those made by man, and due to the dramatic events that are taking place, we will concentrate on the oceans, true black holes in which the dreams of immigrants come to a tragic end. The absence of man-made elements can be more powerful than the presence of the very same barriers. The interesting thing about the Berlin Wall, having certain similarities to the Great Wall of China, is its slow (but deliberate) transformation from Cold War symbol to souvenir and finally its disappearance altogether in favour of urbanistic exploitation. The best analysis of this condition, as R. Koolhaas states (encloses free space, leaving outside the enclosed city), resides in its mutable situation, sometimes improvised evolution, and others detailed planning. It seems unfathomable that after the disappearance of one wall someone could construct another, especially under considerations so stingy such as those carved out by Israel. A proposition for the borders of the future: In agreement with J. Deridda, although arbitrarily applying his thinking to our reflections, it will consist in constantly questioning the relevance of the limit/boundary, equilibrating the pressure between the interior and exterior, {{as if it were a}} permeable membrane. That way we would recognise that marginality is not on one side, but rather on both, inside and out, expanding this way the boundaries of mere vertical elements in strips, that would be enriched by their own state, no longer the soil of anyone, but rather a place in constant state of redefinition, in agreement with the existing pressures, the situation and conformity of the border. In essence a sponge that absorbs and repels human demands depending on its capacity (unlimited), becoming a meeting place instead of an element to be crossed...|$|E
