40|$|In {{the case}} {{decided by the}} French Cour de Cassation on 23 October 2012, a {{franchisee}} invoked the rules on unjustified enrichment to claim compensation for loss of clientele (also referred to as ‘goodwill compensation’) resulting from the termination of the franchise contract. The Cour de Cassation dismissed the claim of the franchisee, stating that the rules on unjustified enrichment may not be invoked if the alleged enrichment of the defendant and the alleged impoverishment of the claimant find their justification in the execution or {{termination of a contract}} entered into by the claimant and the defendant. The following reports examine how this case would be resolved in seven other European jurisdictions – Belgium, Estonia, Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom, Italy and the Netherlands – as well as under the Draft Common Frame of Reference. The overall conclusion is that all the examined jurisdictions are reluctant to allow an unjustified enrichment claim for loss of clientele after termination of a franchise contract. However, in almost all the examined jurisdictions, legal scholars and courts seem to look for alternative ways to grant a franchisee, under certain conditions, a goodwill compensation after termination of the franchise contract, e. g. by applying the <b>specific</b> statutory <b>rules</b> <b>concerning</b> commercial agency by way of analogy to franchises...|$|R

50|$|A horse {{community}} or equestrian {{community is a}} planned real estate development or community where people live with their horses on their property or at a facility within the rural or suburban development, with a shared trails network for pleasure riding. There are usually a number of deeded restrictions that can include <b>specific</b> <b>rules</b> <b>concerning</b> {{the use of the}} property, deeded community horse trails, the number of horses allowed per lot, and restrictions on commercial use of the horse trails. Many of these communities are gated and/or guarded, implying wealthy residents, but not all are. These Equestrian communities sometimes have a centralized barn with arenas where all of the horses are stalled, but otherwise the horses are kept on the individual property owners' lots. In the United States, these communities are located throughout the country and are diverse in both price and size. These communities appear to be growing in popularity as the availability of riding trails decreases and urban sprawl increases.|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we tested {{the effect of the}} {{mandatory}} adoption of IFRS upon the value relevance of earnings and book values using data from the Athens Stock Exchange that covered a period of two years before and two years after the mandatory adoption of IFRS. Greece is a code-law country with strong tax conformity, bank orientation and conservative accounting rules which {{have a negative effect on}} the value relevance of financial statements. As IFRS adoption promotes fair value accounting and weakens the link between taxation and accounting rules we expect earnings and book value to become more value relevant ceteris paribus. We report that the adoption of IFRS positively affected the value relevance of consolidated net income and book value although it had no effect on their unconsolidated counterparts and that consolidated accounting numbers are by far more value relevant than unconsolidated ones in both periods and, unexpectedly, this superiority is more pronounced after IFRS adoption. We also report that disaggregating net income increases the explanatory power of the earnings – book value capitalization (EBVC) model. Finally, we report that although the overall explanatory power of the model increases, the incremental explanatory power of both net income and financial income decreases. These last findings question the expected benefits of <b>specific</b> IFRS <b>rules</b> <b>concerning</b> the measurement of these income components. Nevertheless, assuming that the total impact of IFRS adoption is captured by the overall explanatory power of the models which actually increased, we conclude that mandating IFRS may prove beneficial even in an unfavorable context. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} an overview of the unique tradition of the islanders of Kihnu of wearing headscarves. I discuss the importance of cotton print headscarves in the traditional clothing of Kihnu women and explain the meaning of kallisseltsi headscarves as an intra-community phenomenon, giving an overview of the origin and characteristics thereof. Cotton print headscarves are considered an integral part of Kihnu traditional clothing, but as purchased goods they have, up to the present, remained beyond the scope of ethnographic studies. Headscarves are classified by material, origin and purpose. Even today seven different types of headscarves are known: names were assigned to the different types based on their patterns. Headscarves must always be worn in harmony with the main item of clothing: the skirt. The colours and stripes of the skirt convey the events that take place {{in the course of a}} woman’s life. Adherence to the rules is supervised by the elders of the community and the more knowledgeable members who look after the preservation of the island’s traditions. As in the case of wearing, there are <b>specific</b> unwritten <b>rules</b> <b>concerning</b> the care, storage and folding of headscarves. In the Kihnu community the most valuable cotton headscarves are those made of red printed calico that were produced in the late 19 th century and the early 20 th century in Russia, in the Province of Vladimir in Aleksandrov County. Elsewhere in the world, the headscarves are also known by their main colour – Turkish red. The owning of kallisseltsi headscarves is in a way a status symbol in the Kihnu community: the owner of the largest number of headscarves is considered the proudest and richest. The circulation of headscarves is very carefully monitored and the most valuable ones are only worn during important life events...|$|R

40|$|High Nature Value farmlands (HNVf) {{are defined}} as rural lands {{characterized}} by high levels of biodiversity and extensive farming practices. These farmlands are also known to provide important ecosystems services, such as food production, pollination, water purification and landscape recreation. Recently, this concept has been introduced in Rural Development Programmes related to biodiversity preservation in traditional agricultural landscapes. However, there are no <b>specific</b> <b>rules</b> <b>concerning</b> the practical use of the concept, particularly on the identification of potential HNVf areas at a local scale. However, this application becomes important for farmland biodiversity protection {{in the context of}} multi-scale agricultural development. We present a novel approach for HNVf mapping, which provides an improved local discrimination of farmlands according to their contribution for the conservation of rural biodiversity and ecosystem services. Our approach is based on a multi-criteria valuation of habitat types based on the national land cover map and agrarian censuses. It is onsidered applicable in other EU countries since comparable datasets are usually available. This methodology is also expected to provide the backbone of a standard, cost-effective methodology for HNVf monitoring, with an emphasis on the impacts of land use change on species, habitats and landscape function...|$|E
40|$|The Draft Guidelines on the {{assessment}} of non-horizontal mergers released by the Commission in February 2007 provides academia, industry and the larger public {{with an opportunity to}} comment on the treatment of non-horizontal concentrations under the new substantive test of the 2004 EC Merger Regulation. The Draft Guidelines is one of the continuous steps towards clarification of both substantive and procedural aspects of the reformed EC merger control. One of the issues that was expected to be clarified in the future Non-Horizontal Guidelines is the treatment of the efficiencies and incorporation of the efficiency defence in merger assessment process. As economic theory demonstrates, vertical and conglomerate concentrations are more likely to generate efficiencies that reduce costs and improve production or distribution processes and quality of the products thus ultimately benefiting the final consumer. As the efficiency defence was recognized in principle, but not yet applied by the Commission or Community courts, the future Non-Horizontal Guidelines have special importance in clarifying this legal concept and its practical application. Present work analyses the Draft Guidelines {{in the light of the}} preceding administrative guidelines issued by the Commission and recent case law developments in the area of EC merger control. The author submits that the Draft Guidelines fall short of improving the chances of the efficiency defence being effectively applied by the merging parties in view of the increasing standard of proof and judicial review. The article advocates the elaboration of more detailed and <b>specific</b> <b>rules</b> <b>concerning</b> the efficiency defence that would provide the parties with a functioning procedural mechanism giving a chance for efficiency claims to be considered against the alleged competitive harm...|$|E
40|$|Art. 7 of Regulation No. 864 / 07 (so called Rome II Regulation) {{provides}} a <b>specific</b> conflict-of- law <b>rule</b> <b>concerning</b> liability for environmental damage, which empowers the person seeking {{compensation for damage}} to choose the lex loci actus instead of the lex loci damni as basis {{for his or her}} claim. The paper, first, investigates the rationale for entrusting only one of the parties involved in the environmental damage (i. e. the person seeking compensation) with the right to unilaterally choose the law governing the claim for damage, and reaches the conclusion that the provision at issue does not only (or mainly) purport to affect the balance between the said parties, but rather aims at ensuring a high level of environmental protection, both by preventing a race {{to the bottom of the}} relevant national legal standards and by discouraging the environmental dumping. Further, the paper (i) compares the specific provision laid down by Art. 7 of Rome II Regulation with the general-conflict-of law rule provided by Art. 4, which exceptionally vests (not the person seeking compensation for damage, but) national courts with the power to derogate from the lex loci damni in principle applicable, and (ii) underlines the specific role played – in the context of environmental liability – by party autonomy, also in light of the provisions of Art. 14 of the Regulation itself.

40|$|Human {{conduct is}} in {{particular}} circumestances {{determined by a}} set of interconnected motives constituting motivation. Motivation needs to be purposefully shaped through creating for employees means and motivating situations which enable them to attain preferred values. Among such values a special role is played by remuneration which is necessary to fulfill various needs of an employee and his/her family. Remuneration may and should be an important factor of stimulating motivation and directing productive behaviour of people. However, if it is to perform such a role, <b>specific</b> <b>rules</b> <b>concerning</b> the composition and forms of application of pay must be observed, and various reinforcing activities indirectly influencing its motivating function must be undertaken. Its efficient fulfillment of such a function, i. e. the function of stimulating productivity and quality of work, depends on the following factors: buying power of money, actractiveness of the market, ways of obtaining raises in pay, a system of pay promotion in force, a structure of needs satisfied by means of pay, spread of income differentiation and ways of its reduction, connection between pay and effectiveness of work, forms of remuneration, internal structure of pay and psychophysical characteristics of employees, defining the level of their readiness to work depending on their living and working conditions. All those factors exert an influence in many ways and to a different degree on the employees' motivation, on its direction and intensity. It is indispensable to know and employ those factors in the process of motivating, for only an integral, systematic approach to motivation may guarantee its correct understanding and application in managing the work process and in increasing the employees' committment in their work and duties.

40|$|The {{subject of}} F. Bastien's lecture given to Polish {{students}} within the framwork of Tempus cooperation is the procedure {{of controlling the}} conformity the of laws with the constitution. Although the idea of such a control {{was born in the}} USA {{at the beginning of the}} 19 th century, it was introduced in Europe only in the 20 th century. The first part of the article concerns the development of constitutional justice in Europe, from the first Constitutional Court in Austria till the latest legal changes after 1989. At the moment all written constitutions in the European states provide the control of conformity to the constitution of laws stated by parliaments or by special courts. The second part of the article focuses on the French system. According to the French Constitution of 1958, the special court, named Conseil Constitutionnel, is authorised to control the contents of laws (but not decrees, which are controlled by Conseil d'Etat). The procedure can take place only after the vote of the Parliament and before the promulgation of law by President: it is on a priori controlling system. The main part contains the analysis of Conseil Constitutionnel's decisions. As the Constitution of 1958 does not include many <b>specific</b> <b>rules</b> <b>concerning</b> civil rights, the court decided to base its decisions on the Declaration of Civil and Human Rights of 1789 and on the "republican laws". They are both referred to as "especially valuable for the French People" in the Preamble of the Constitution. In this way, the court began - in 1972 - to control the laws not only in their form, but also taking into account their contents. Since then the Conseil Constitutionnel has awarded many decisions precising the notion of liberty, of right to property, of social order and so on. The last part of the lecture contains an evaluation of the development of constitutional control of laws: some scepticism is uttered about the fact, that it i. e. the Parliament is not the representation of nation, but it is the lawyers and clerks who - as the highest authority - decide whether the law id admissible and in conformity with constitution. It may be weakening factor of democracy. Digitalizacja i deponowanie archiwalnych zeszytów RPEiS sfinansowane przez MNiSW w ramach realizacji umowy nr 541 /P-DUN/ 201...|$|E
40|$|This master’s thesis {{examines}} the new group coordination proceedings {{established in the}} renewed EU Insolvency Regulation (the Recast Regulation). The theme of this thesis as such is not new, as coordination of insolvency proceedings has been studied both in national and international levels. However, {{for the first time}} it is possible to study an actual solution for coordination of insolvency proceedings of multinational groups of companies, as the European Union tries to solve the problems of group insolvency by establishing rules for coordination of insolvency proceedings. This thesis aims to answer the following ostensibly simple question: what are group coordination proceedings? Because the rules concerning group coordination proceedings are so new, this kind of basic research conducted in this thesis is in order, especially as there is no knowledge on how the group coordination proceedings work in real-life and there is no case law that would demonstrate how the rules concerning the group coordination proceedings should be interpreted. As for the relevant theoretical framework, this thesis provides analysis on the definition of a group of companies {{in the context of the}} Recast Regulation. Furthermore, the separate legal nature of group members shall be discussed and the opposing theories, the theory of legal separateness and the theory of unification shall be examined. In addition, the cross-border aspect of the thesis shall be investigated as well as different ways to coordinate insolvency proceedings opened in respect of different group members. In the thesis, these different ways are divided into three different categories: coordinated cooperation, joint administration and substantive consolidation. The chapters before the conclusions are dedicated to the <b>specific</b> <b>rules</b> <b>concerning</b> group coordination proceedings. Thus, opening of the group coordination proceedings as well as the tasks of the coordinator shall be discussed. Not all the problematics shall be introduced as the length of the thesis is quite limited. The aim has been to highlight the most important problematics. It is concluded that the theory of legal separateness presents itself extremely well in the group coordination proceedings, thus it is clear that the theory is followed almost to the letter. As for the group coordination proceedings as a whole, it is suitable only to large insolvency cases where to costs of the coordination can be taken care of. In addition, the choice of an outside coordinator is probably not the best solution, as it takes time for the coordinator to get to know all the relevant proceedings. On the other hand, interests of conflicts are avoided better by choosing an outsider to act as the coordinator. However, the group coordination proceedings do not necessarily lead to efficient and effective coordination of insolvency proceedings opened in respect of group members. In conclusion, the concept of the group coordination proceedings is a beautiful idea, but the situations where such coordination is used are more of an exception than a rule...|$|E
