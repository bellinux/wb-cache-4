40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{disposition}} of inhalation anaesthetics {{is governed by}} the factors described in the Fick principle. METHODS: We have recalibrated a previously validated physiological model for enflurane closed-circuit inhalation anaesthesia, using individual continuous cardiac output measurements as well as age-related enflurane <b>solubility</b> <b>coefficients</b> as inputs to the model. Two model versions using 'calculated' (Brody's formula) or 'measured' (thoracic electrical bioimpedance) cardiac output values, and two versions with 'standard' (fixed) or 'age-related' <b>solubility</b> <b>coefficients</b> were formulated. RESULTS: Data from 62 ophthalmic surgical patients were used to validate the predictive performance of the four model versions. The root mean squared errors (total error) and scatters (error variation) were similar with the extended model versions, but the group biases (systematic error component) were significantly less with the model versions that included age-related solubility compared with the versions using standard <b>solubility</b> <b>coefficients</b> (bias - 0. 76 /- 0. 78 % vs - 3. 44 /- 3. 60 %). CONCLUSION: The inclusion of age-related <b>solubility</b> <b>coefficients</b> but not of continuous cardiac output measurements improves the predictive performance of the physiological model for closed-circuit inhalation anaesthetic conditions in routine clinical practice...|$|R

40|$|The {{solubility}} {{coefficients of}} helium, argon, and xenon in two SBS block copolymer samples having different domain structures were determined between 25 and 120 °C by the desorption and the time-lag methods. In {{the first method}} after the equilibrium had been established between polymer and gas phase, the dissolved gas was desorbed into a known large volume, and the <b>solubility</b> <b>coefficient</b> S was evaluated. In the second method the time-lag <b>solubility</b> <b>coefficient</b> S was cal-culated from the values of permeability and (time-lag) diffusion coefficients, which were obtained from permeability experiments. In the desorption process of the first method, the pressure increase in the desorption system was measured {{as a function of}} time, and the diffusion coefficient was es-timated therefrom. For all systems over the pressure and temperature range studied, Henry's law was always obeyed, and little differences between two copolymer sampleswere observed. At lower temperatures the values of S were greater than those of S 5. It was concluded that the time-lag method counts only the mobile penetrant molecule in the rubbery polybutadiene matrix, while the desorption method counts less diffusive species in the glassy polystyrene domains as well.

40|$|The helium {{and oxygen}} gas barrier {{properties}} of poly(lactide) were investigated {{as a function}} of stereochemistry and crystallinity degree. Poly(L-lactide) and poly(D,L-lactide) films were obtained by extrusion and thermally cold crystallized in either alpha'- or alpha-crystalline form with increasing crystallinity degree. Annealing of the films at low temperatures yielded to alpha'-crystals as well as the creation of a rigid amorphous fraction in the amorphous phase. Unexpectedly, the quantity of the rigid amorphous fraction was highest in poly(L-lactide) crystallized under alpha'-form. Unexpectedly, the gas permeability increased with increasing quantity of alpha'-crystals in poly(L-lactide) and remained constant with increasing quantity of alpha'-crystals in poly(D,L-lactide). A gain in gas barrier properties was obtained upon crystallization at higher temperatures yielding alpha-crystals. The analysis of the oxygen transport parameters, in particular the diffusion and the <b>solubility</b> <b>coefficient</b> showed that the diffusion was accelerated upon crystallization, while the <b>solubility</b> <b>coefficient</b> decreased in an expected manner which led to conclude that it remained constant in the amorphous phase. The acceleration of the diffusion seems to be correlated to the occurrence of the rigid amorphous fraction, which holds larger free volume. To conclude, for optimization of poly(lactide) gas barrier properties by focussing on the decrease of the diffusion coefficient it can be suggested to work with poly(D,L-lactide) and to aim a crystallization in alpha-form avoiding the formation of a rigid amorphous fraction.

If water sample containing radon is flushed (bubbled) with air in closed loop with Lucas cell {{in such a manner}} that radon equilibrium is achieved between radon dissolved in water and radon flushed into the air the following relation can be written: (1) Q = qp kVw + qVp (2) where: qp – radon concentration in air per unit volume; Q – total radon activity in water before flushing; k – coefficient of radon solubility in water; Vw – volume of water sample; Vp – volume of air including Lucas cell, air pump and connections.

40|$|Over {{the past}} 20 years freon- 22 {{has been used}} for the inert gas method of {{measurement}} of cardiac output. A major drawback to its use is the confusion between Bunsen and Ostwald solubility coefficients; the exact coefficient is critical for an accurate determination of cardiac output. Several studies report values for solubility coefficients, although none indicates how the measurements of solubility were performed, or their accuracy. Bayley, Clements and Osbahr [1] used a coefficient of 0. 71 mlgas. (mlt]uld. atmos-phere) " 1 at 37 °C (which will be represented as ml ml" 1 atmos" 1) determined in rabbit blood. A value of 0. 74 ml ml" 1 atmos" 1 at 37 °C in neonatal blood was given in another paper [2]. These values are confusing, as it is unclear whether the gas volumes were corrected to STPD (Bunsen coefficients) or to BTPS (Ostwald coefficients). Both these studies failed to provide experimental details of the solubility measurement. The <b>solubility</b> <b>coefficient</b> for freon 22 (given in [2]) was attributed to Eger and Shargel, but no information was provided. It was stated that they used an adaptation of the Scholander apparatus [3], and exposed blood to pure freon (J. A. Clements, personal communication). Kruhoffer [4] reported, in an abstract, a Bunsen coefficient of 0. 71 ml ml" 1 atmos" 1, although the method of determination was prone to inaccuracy (P. W. Kruhoffer, personal communication). Since then, other determinations by that author have fallen within the range 0. 62 - 0. 74 ml ml" 1 atmos" 1, on exposing blood to pure freon- 22.

30|$|Despite the {{decrease}} in diffusivity, the solubility of PBI-PDA-TiNT MMMs remained relatively unchanged for H 2, N 2, O 2, and CH 4 {{with the increase of}} nanotubes, besides for CO 2 (Fig.  7 b). CO 2 is a more condensable gas than all the other studied gases. The increased gas condensability leads to the enhancement of the solubility of the gas in the polymer matrix, which confirms the dominancy of the solution mechanism in the permeation of CO 2 through the MMMs upon addition of PDA-TiNTs. Moreover, the strong polar affinity between the functional groups of PDA {{on the surface of the}} nanotubes and CO 2 results in an increased CO 2 solubility. With the increase of PDA-TiNT in the matrix the CO 2 solubility increases due to the larger content of CO 2 -facilitated transport sites in the membranes, which leads to a steady increase of CO 2 /N 2 solubility selectivity (Fig.  7 d). In contrary, the solubility values of the PPO-PDA-TiNT MMMs showed for all gases an increase in <b>solubility</b> <b>coefficients</b> (Fig.  8 b). Highest increase of solubility selectivity was found for the gas pair H 2 /N 2, which might be due to the differences in kinetic diameters of these gas molecules. If one compares the solubility values of the neat polymers, it can be found that the <b>solubility</b> <b>coefficients</b> (Fig.  8 d) of all gases besides CH 4 are higher for PPO than for PBI (Fig.  7 d); thus, the gases can solubilise better in PPO than in PBI.

Unavoidable changes in protein content of the three cheese variants is suspected to produce an interaction with water content, leading to complex interpretation of the results.

The variability of the oxygen <b>solubility</b> <b>coefficient</b> allows to explain the scattering of induction times and oxidation rates among the whole iPP family, but also the dependence of this latter quantity with oxygen partial pressure.
