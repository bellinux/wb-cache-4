500|$|Development of the Nintendo DSi {{started at}} the end of 2006. It was the first time Masato Kuwahara of Nintendo's Development Engineering Department served as a {{hardware}} project leader. Work went at a quick pace to meet deadlines; his team had to devise a theme for the new DS in time for a late December presentation, and by February 2007, most specifications for a chipset had to be completed. Kuwahara reported that his team had difficulty determining the potential market for the handheld during the design process; he said of their goal, [...] "We {{have to be able to}} sell the console on its own [...] It also has to be able to meld into the already-existing DS market." [...] The console's digital cameras were considered early in development: Nintendo president and Chief Executive Officer Satoru Iwata described the touchscreen as the Nintendo DS's sense of touch, and the microphone as its [...] "ears"; a co-worker suggested that it should have [...] "eyes". Kuwahara's team originally wanted one camera with a <b>swivel</b> <b>mechanism,</b> but this was abandoned due to concerns of reliability, cost, and the need of a thicker console. Owing to consumer demand, Nintendo also improved the handhelds' volume and audio quality and made it slimmer with larger screens compared to the Nintendo DS Lite. However, to improve portability without sacrificing durability, the GBA cartridge slot present on earlier models was removed. To compensate, Nintendo continued to support the DS Lite as long as there was consumer demand for it.|$|E

50|$|With heavier punishments, patrolling police cars, crackdowns {{in meeting}} {{areas and the}} {{installation}} of speed cameras, expressway racing in Japan is not as common {{today as it was}} during the 1980s and the 1990s. Still, it occurs on a not-so-regular basis. Persistent racers often install spring assisted license-plate <b>swivelling</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that hold plates down at speed or picture-proof screens over their plates. In 2001, the amount of hashiriya dropped from 9,624 (in 1995) to 4,365 and police arrests in areas where hashiriya gather are common. Cars are checked for illegal modification and if found, owners are fined and forced to remove the offending modifications.|$|R
50|$|A {{circle of}} death can be {{initiated}} if the boat operator releases the steering mechanism while {{the boat is}} still powered, which means the propeller is still turning. The force of the rotating propeller blades incurs a force known as steering torque, causing the motor itself, which is mounted on a <b>swivel</b> jointed <b>mechanism,</b> to turn sharply into {{the direction of the}} blades. This causes the boat to cut sharply to the opposite direction, which can throw the operator and any passengers overboard. The boat then begins spinning in circles, often times around the ejected passengers, who are in danger of being struck by the spinning propeller over and over again.|$|R

50|$|These Swivel 'n Go Seats are {{manufactured}} by Intier Corp. {{a division of}} Magna. The tracks, risers and swivel mechanisms are assembled by Camslide, a division of Intier. The <b>swivel</b> <b>mechanism</b> was designed by and is produced by Toyo Seat USA Corp.|$|E
40|$|The NASA Stabilized Payload Deployment System (SPDS) is discussed. The {{lightweight}} and heavy-duty system rolls payloads over the orbiter's side rather than ejecting them upward. The system {{will enhance the}} orbiter capability of carrying larger and heavier payloads. The design, function, and analysis of a new three-pin double <b>swivel</b> toggle release <b>mechanism</b> which {{is crucial to the}} successful deployment of the SPDS are described...|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1960s Kodak {{improved}} their Instamatic camera line by replacing the individual flashbulb technology (used on early Instamatics) with the Flashcube. A flashcube was a single-use module with four flashbulbs mounted at 90° {{from the others}} in its own reflector. For use it was mounted on a <b>swivel</b> <b>mechanism</b> atop the camera that also provided an electrical connection to the shutter release and a battery inside the camera. After each exposure, the film advance mechanism also rotated the flashcube 90° to a fresh bulb. This arrangement allowed the user to take four images in rapid succession before inserting a new flashcube.|$|E

50|$|Her {{left arm}} started giving her {{more and more}} burden and pain and the arm started to grow crooked. She had less and less {{movement}} in her left arm and noticed that, in relation to her right arm, the left arm seemed to be shorter. She {{had to return to}} the hospital and there they discovered that the epiphysis of the radius was so damaged during her fall, that one bone was no longer growing. Because the other bones in her arm are still growing, her left arm is growing crooked. This growth disorder is also known as Madelung's deformity. Only, in Kruger's case, the disorder is caused by a trauma and is not a hereditary or congenital defect. Because of these problems she had to undergo multiple surgeries, including an operation to extend the bone, where a pin was inserted to the non-growing bone, with a <b>swivel</b> <b>mechanism</b> on the outside. For three months she had to tighten the screws every day, in order to slightly lengthen the bone. This radical surgery did not do what the doctors hoped for and the doctor declared her inoperable in August 2014. As far as trying to extend the non-growing bone, the bone had been pushed over her carpal bones, which only caused her to have less movement in her wrist. So she has limited movement in her wrist, she can not turn her arm, can not put any pressure on her arm and can not hang on it. Her left arm is now about 7 centimetres shorter than the right arm and her left hand is a little bit smaller than her right hand. She has virtually no strength in her left hand and therefore 70% less strength in her left arm in comparison to her right arm. Until she stops growing she has to have, regular check-ups at the Erasmus hospital in Rotterdam, {{to see if there is}} a need for emergency surgery because of the imbalance. But it will never be all right again.|$|E

40|$|A {{parachute}} <b>swivel</b> <b>mechanism</b> (PSM) for planetary entry missions {{such as a}} Mars probe (MARSNET) {{or return}} of cometary material samples (ROSETTA mission) has been developed. The purpose of the PSM is to decouple the spin of the probe from the parachute, with low friction torque, during both the deployment and descent phases. Critical requirements are high shock loads, low friction, low temperatures, and several years of storage in the deep space environment (during the cruise phase of the probe, prior to operation). The design uses a main thrust ball bearing {{to cope with the}} load requirement and a smaller thrust ball bearing for guiding of the shaft. Except for use on the Viking and Galileo swivels, it appears that this type of bearing has very rarely been employed in space mechanisms, so that little is known of its friction behavior with dry lubrication. A slip ring assembly allows the transfer of electrical power for post-reefing of the parachute. A test program has been conducted covering the environmental conditions of Mars entry and Earth reentry. This paper describes requirement constraints, model missions of planetary entries, a bearing trade-off, analyses performed, design details, the lubrication system, and test results (friction torque versus load/spin rate). In addition, the design of the test rig is addressed...|$|E
40|$|As the Earth’s {{population}} {{continues to}} grow and resources continue to dwindle, humankind has looked to other planets for possible colonization. With current technology, colonization of Mars is the most viable option. Although general facts about Mars are known, such as its low temperatures, low pressure, and atmospheric density, more specific information is needed. To this end, team ARES from the Colorado School of Mines has designed a module to measure atmospheric conditions. Our module is capable of measuring temperature, pressure, wind speed, and particle concentration. The module will take measurements every minute and the data will be transmitted twice daily to an orbiting satellite. In order to provide overlap in case of interference during transmission time, because of occurrences such as dust storms, the data will be stored for 24 hours. Our design is an expanding modular structure, similar to a Hoberman Micro Sphere ® by Hoberman Designs, Inc, in which the instruments are protected from the harsh atmospheric conditions yet are still able to take measurements. The interior will consist of eight octants. A rod attached to {{opposite sides of the}} frame expands upon landing, opening the frame. A <b>swivel</b> <b>mechanism</b> at the middle of the rod allows the octets to orient themselves. The bottom four octets will house the instruments, computer, and batterie...|$|E
