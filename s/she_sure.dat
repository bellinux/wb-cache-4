500|$|A November 1, 1958, {{article in}} The Seattle Times {{was typical of}} the media's {{favorable}} coverage of the future First Lady, stating that [...] "Mrs. Nixon is always reported to be gracious and friendly. And <b>she</b> <b>sure</b> is friendly. She greets a stranger as a friend. She doesn't just shake hands but clasps a visitor's hand in both her hands. Her manner is direct... Mrs. Nixon also upheld her reputation of always looking neat, no matter how long her day has been." [...] A year and a half later, during her husband's campaign for the presidency, The New York Times called her [...] "a paragon of wifely virtues" [...] whose [...] "efficiency makes other women feel slothful and untalented".|$|E
500|$|Eventually, {{things got}} to the stage where Angelina's father forced Kevin to marry his daughter. Becca Badget of Yahoo! wrote: [...] "Kevin keeps to himself that he married Angelina to avoid a bullet from Angelo's henchman. The guests are unaware that he married her to stay alive." [...] While this happened, Kevin's mother Gloria Bardwell (Judith Chapman) was {{involved}} with Angelo, who had kidnapped and sent away her husband Jeffrey Bardwell (Ted Shackelford) to have Gloria for himself. On whether or not Kevin will ever love her, DeGarmo said: [...] "I know <b>she</b> <b>sure</b> hopes so. She did {{try to get him}} to marry her." [...] The relationship, however, ended when Angelina realizes that he never loved her. DeGarmo said: [...] "Kevin does see the light inside Angelina, even though that light may be a little dim sometimes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That was Jen," [...] said Mrs. Bland. [...] "She's the kid we keep here, and <b>she</b> <b>sure</b> hardly pays her keep. Did Euchre {{tell you}} about her?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, then, <b>she's</b> <b>sure</b> to {{want you}} to-day. If mother takes {{to people at}} the beginning, <b>she's</b> <b>sure</b> to get fond of 'em; but she's a strange way of not liking young women. Though, to be sure," [...] Adam went on, smiling, [...] "her not liking other young women {{is no reason why}} she shouldn't like you." ...|$|R
50|$|Other times, <b>she's</b> not <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> cares.|$|R
60|$|LORD LOAM (heavily). She thinks I have, but I couldn't. <b>She's</b> <b>sure</b> to {{find out}} to-night.|$|R
6000|$|... "I does though, sir, and it's <b>she,</b> <b>sure</b> enough. If that isn't Miss Hopportunity, the {{prisoner}} that the savages has {{got up in}} the cellar of the old farm-house, isn't her brother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Golly!" [...] {{he said to}} himself; [...] "of all the doggone cloth for a dress! Reg'lar gunny-sacking. She's skinny, too. Bright-red hair. <b>She</b> <b>sure</b> is {{the prize}} freak. Kind of good-looking, but--get a brick!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was just}} {{great to see}} you. How your hair burned in the wind! Al, <b>she</b> <b>sure</b> can ride. Oh, I'm so glad! I was a little afraid. And that horse! Isn't he grand? Can't he run?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Again Miss Merry pouted, {{and looked}} down, and plucked the grass, and shrugged her shoulders. No. She didn't {{know that she}} had. <b>She</b> was pretty <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> hadn't. Quite <b>sure,</b> <b>she</b> might say. She 'didn't mind it.' ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Fillson, {{holding out}} her hand to Mr. Fillson, said <b>she</b> was <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> wasn't.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, dear no! Dolly says <b>she's</b> <b>sure</b> to have rheumatic fever, if she don't have noo-monia!" [...] {{answered}} Phebe, {{careful to}} pronounce the word rightly this time.|$|R
6000|$|... 'O, ay, 'tis nearly time,' and he {{was again}} absorbed. She thought {{he would not be}} pleased if she went home alone, nor was <b>she</b> <b>sure</b> of the way; so she waited in much annoyance, till at length he said, 'Now, Violet,' and they walked briskly home, all that she had endured passing entirely out of her mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Holt's {{turned over}} a new leaf. He's working hard, and I think he has taken a tumble to himself. Listen to this. He met Margie with Dick Swann out {{at one of the}} lake dances--Watkins' Lake. And he cut her dead. I'm sorry for Margie. <b>She</b> <b>sure</b> is rank poison these days.... Well, speak of the devil!" ...|$|E
60|$|It didn't take my practised ear long to {{discover}} that it wasn't me and Charlie that the great public was cheering for. We would go round the floor without getting a hand, and every time Mrs Charlie and her guy got to a corner there was a noise like election night. <b>She</b> <b>sure</b> had made a hit.|$|E
50|$|Blair finds Louis's wedding vows {{to her and}} {{she realizes}} that Louis loves her even if she almost left him for Chucl and that <b>she's</b> <b>sure</b> of marrying Louis.|$|R
50|$|Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee) and Derek Wills (Jack Davenport) {{have made}} it to Karen's {{apartment}} and continue drinking wine for several more hours. After they drink the last of the wine, they start to make out. Derek asks her if <b>she's</b> <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> wants to do this and they continue.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then {{do you go}} to Holmstoke church to-morrow morning: <b>she's</b> <b>sure</b> to be there. Go {{early and}} notice her walking in, and come home and tell me if she's taller than I.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{did not say}} how she {{did know}} it, for a pang smote her as she remembered dimly a scene, when her father had {{forbidden}} her mother to avail herself of escort thus obtained. Nor was <b>she</b> <b>sure</b> that the word all was accurately the fact; but it was delightful to impress Constance, who cried, 'How perfectly delicious! I suppose he can get any article into his paper!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Slone, it jarred me some, thet disappointment. But it's over," [...] replied Bostil. [...] "An' so thet's how Lucy {{found her}} hoss. <b>She</b> <b>sure</b> was mysterious.... Wal, wal." [...] Bostil {{became aware of}} others behind him. [...] "Holley, shake hands with Slone, hoss-wrangler out of Utah.... You, too, Cal Blinn.... An' Macomber--an' Wetherby, meet my friend here--young Slone.... An', Cordts, shake hands with a feller thet owns a grand hoss!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gee!" [...] he concluded, {{as the car}} drew {{up before}} his hotel. [...] "If I'd only known it as I do now, I'd have popped the {{question}} the first day she came to work. According to her say-so, {{that would have been}} the proper moment. She likes me more and more, and the more she likes me the less she'd care to marry me! Now what do you think of that? <b>She</b> <b>sure</b> must be fooling." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> was not <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> {{had heard}} him, {{and was about}} to repeat her question.|$|R
6000|$|... "Neither hev I. Wal, I'll be goin', Wade. I reckon Columbine {{will be up}} to call on you. Bein' {{the only}} woman-folk in my house, she sort of runs it. An' <b>she's</b> <b>sure</b> {{interested}} in thet pack of hounds." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the right}} moment, and when <b>she</b> was <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> was not overheard, Lady Firebrace played her trump card, the pack having been {{previously}} cut by Mr Tadpole.|$|R
6000|$|Ross made no comment, and {{the other}} went on, {{in a tone of}} {{reminiscent}} sadness. [...] "Lize has changed terribly. I used to know her when she was a girl. Judas Priest! but she could ride and shoot in those days!" [...] His eyes kindled with the memory of her. [...] "She could back a horse to beat any woman that ever crossed the range, but I didn't expect to see her have such a skein of silk as that girl. <b>She</b> <b>sure</b> looks the queen to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Shorty gulped {{and changed}} his thought. [...] "Huh! I don't need no hunch to guess HER name. The rest of 'em {{has gone up}} to the drainin' of Surprise Lake, but Joy Gastell allowed she wouldn't go. She's stickin' around Dawson, waitin' to see if I come back with you. An' <b>she</b> <b>sure</b> swears, if I don't, she'll sell her holdin's an' hire a army of gun-fighters, an' go into the Caribou Country an' knock the everlastin' stuffin' outa old Snass an' his whole gang. An' if you'll hold your horses a couple of shakes, I reckon I'll get packed up an' ready to hike along with you." ...|$|E
60|$|For a {{long time}} he drove on without another word. Evidently he was in deep thought and the {{constant}} pressure of the revolver against his side gave him ample food for reflection. Nan was thinking, too, quietly exulting, the while. As {{a matter of fact}} she had hazarded guess after guess, during the interview, only to find she had hit the mark. She knew that Ned Cragg had been condemned by the British government and was supposed to have escaped to America, but not until now was <b>she</b> <b>sure</b> of his identity with Ned Joselyn. Her father had told her much, but not this. Her native shrewdness was alone responsible for the discovery.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You see, my dear wife, that I was right,' {{he said at}} last. 'Fortune is so capricious, you {{can never}} count on her. Run after her, and <b>she</b> is <b>sure</b> to fly from you; stay still, and <b>she</b> is <b>sure</b> to come.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why yes, certainly. But {{the world}} of art will not satisfy that girl. <b>She's</b> <b>sure</b> to marry--she must marry--and she is {{entitled}} to more consideration. You've got to look ahead {{to the time when}} she regrets the lack of husband and children." ...|$|R
60|$|Miss Hartley, {{without even}} troubling {{to look at}} him, said that <b>she</b> was quite <b>sure</b> <b>she</b> had not.|$|R
6000|$|His eye {{had become}} quite {{critical}} wherever Dede Mason was concerned. He {{had long since}} noted her pride of carriage. It was unobtrusive, yet it was there. He decided, {{from the way she}} carried it, that she deemed her body a thing to be proud of, to be cared for as a beautiful and valued possession. In this, and in the way she carried her clothes, he compared her with her assistant, with the stenographers he encountered in other offices, with the women he saw on the sidewalks. [...] "She's sure well put up," [...] he communed with himself; [...] "and <b>she</b> <b>sure</b> knows how to dress and carry it off without being stuck on herself and without laying it on thick." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So now farewell; doubtless I weary thee, and--Gudruda waits. Nay, look {{not on my}} foolish tears: {{they are}} the {{heritage}} of woman, of naught else is <b>she</b> <b>sure!</b> While I live, Eric, morn by morn the thought of thee shall come to wake me as the sun wakes yon snowy peak, and night by night thy memory shall pass as at eve he passes from the valleys, but to dawn again in dreams. For, Eric, 'tis thee I wed to-day--at heart I am thy bride, thine and thine only; and when shalt thou find a wife who holds thee so dear as that Swanhild whom once thou knewest? So now farewell! Yes, this time thou shalt kiss away my tears; then let them stream for ever. Thus, Eric! and thus! and thus! do I take farewell of thee." ...|$|E
6000|$|In {{the first}} place, though {{she held the}} town, was <b>she</b> <b>sure</b> of the {{principal}} inhabitant? Would Miss Crawley herself hold out; and had she not a secret longing to welcome back the ousted adversary? The old lady liked Rawdon, and Rebecca, who amused her. Mrs. Bute could not disguise from herself the fact that none of her party could so contribute to {{the pleasures of the}} town-bred lady. [...] "My girls' singing, after that little odious governess's, I know is unbearable," [...] the candid Rector's wife owned to herself. [...] "She always used to go to sleep when Martha and Louisa played their duets. Jim's stiff college manners and poor dear Bute's talk about his dogs and horses always annoyed her. If I took her to the Rectory, she would grow angry with us all, and fly, I know she would; and might fall into that horrid Rawdon's clutches again, and be the victim of that little viper of a Sharp. Meanwhile, it is clear to me that she is exceedingly unwell, and cannot move for some weeks, at any rate; during which we must think of some plan to protect her from the arts of those unprincipled people." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{returning}} to his apartment in [...] "Better Halves", Mohinder picks up and prepares to leave. Eden wants him to stay, flirting with and even kissing him before he goes. Though Mohinder feels certain of his choice, Eden says <b>she's</b> <b>sure</b> he'll be back.|$|R
6000|$|Ferd. <b>She's</b> <b>sure</b> the {{mistress}} on whom these airs attend. [...] Fair excellence! if, as your form declares, [...] You are divine, {{be pleased to}} instruct me how [...] You will be worshipped; so bright a beauty [...] Cannot sure belong to human kind.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have," [...] was the reply; [...] "and I’m sure she’ll {{thank me}} for it afterward. You see, Brill, you and I are the only eligibles in the place, and now you are out of it, <b>she’s</b> <b>sure</b> to take me sooner or later." ...|$|R
