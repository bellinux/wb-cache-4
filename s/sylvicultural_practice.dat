40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present the results of a long-term research project carried out in north-east Sardinia, which aims to evaluate the effects of three different kinds of forest management (traditional trunk coppicing, branch pruning, and no <b>sylvicultural</b> <b>practice)</b> on the post-fire recovery of a cork oak (Quercus suber L.) stand. The most and the least effective forestry operations appeared to be traditional trunk coppicing and the branch pruning, respectively. Where traditional trunk coppicing is considered strictly necessary, the opportunity of thinning some of the new suckers should be carefully considered, as modern harvesting techniques should be combined with appropriate strategies to protect the soil from erosion. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to study the forest owner’s coverage strategies in the presence of natural hazards. We develop a theoretical model which considers two periods. In this model, the private forest owner can either save a part of his/her income in order to take precautions against natural hazards or adopt <b>sylvicultural</b> <b>practices.</b> Thus we want to compare a financial prevention tool with a physical one. Our analysis also consider the non-profit services provided by the forest. We produce several comparative static analysis especially on initial wealth, on initial forest stock and on timber prices. We show that, under some assumptions, accumulation of savings and <b>sylvicultural</b> <b>practices</b> may be seen as perfectly substitutable for the forest owners. We also show that this potential substitutability do not imply that the two hedging tools act in the same way on the forest owners behaviour and do not involve that the forest owners react to some given shocks in the economy by the same decisions...|$|R
40|$|Farmer’s {{practices}} and perception in agroforestry park creating in Vipalogo area (Burkina Faso). In {{order to understand}} farmers’ {{practices and}} perceptions in new agroforestry park creating after fallows, a study has been conducted in Vipalogo area in Burkina Faso. During this study, 14 homesteads including fallows which need to be cleared have been identified. On those fallows, ligneous species have been listed before and after clearing. <b>Sylvicultural</b> <b>practices</b> have been noticed as well as reasons that justify the willingness to preserve or to destroy a species, while clearing. This monitoring has shown that from total ligneous potential in the fallow, 11. 7 % was preserved, giving a density of 60 plants ha- 1. As for diversity, 60 species have been registered in the fallows and 41 kept in the park. Slashing and burning are the main <b>sylvicultural</b> <b>practices</b> applied. The preserved species are essentially for food and local medicines. As for the new Park structure, {{there is a great}} dominance of individuals with small diameter, which show the willingness to rejuvenate the Park. Some individuals from the old Park were also preserved to satisfy immediate needs in fruits, seed and shade...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMorphological {{features}} of twelve humus profiles demonstrating {{the diversity of}} vegetation types present in subalpine forests were compared, together with soil fauna. Two forest stands of spruce [Picea abies (L,.) Karat. ] in association with bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus L,.), located at 1630 and 1880 m altitude (Macot-La Plagne, Tarentaise valley, Savoy, France), were studied. Morphological observations of small soil volumes were made on disturbed samples by the method of Ponge, but here transformed into quantitative data. Analysis of the data gave evidence of a large degree of heterogeneity of the form of humus in a given forest stand, {{but most of the}} observed variation might be explained by differences in vegetation, due to phases of the forest cycle and <b>sylvicultural</b> <b>practices.</b> Regeneration sites are characterized by the development of a herbaceous cover under which a mull humus is built through the activity of burrowing earthworm species. During the phase of intense growth of spruce organic matter accumulates in the top few centimeters. At this stage, the Al horizon previously formed under the action of endogeous earthworms becomes inactive but its crumby structure remains stable. Anecic worms (earthworms with a high amplitude of vertical movements) appear again under adult trees. As a result, changes in the form of humus are observed, with seemingly mull formation (burying of litter) but without true incorporation of organic matter to mineral matter. This humus was named dysmull. Thus soil conditions that prevail in the regeneration sites were developed to some extent under pre-existing adult trees. A parallel evolution of soil fauna, form. of humus and vegetation may thus be described. The above mentioned sequence {{is not the only one}} possible. When small gaps in the canopy are created by unsuitable <b>sylvicultural</b> <b>practices</b> such as selection thinning, the development of ericaceous species (bilberry at the higher montane and subalpine levels) may impede the natural forest cycle. Under bilberry, dramatic changes in the form of humus occur: disappearance of the Al horizon previously formed under spruce, accumulation of undecomposed organic matter and, at the subalpine level, podzolization. Accumulation of organic matter under bilberry is mainly due to mosses...|$|R
40|$|Differences of {{raw cork}} quality, {{in terms of}} {{thickness}} and porosity, were observed in productive cork oak (Quercus suber L.) stands in the Nebrodi and Iblei mountains of Sicily in relation to stand density. Five study areas were chosen {{across a range of}} different stand density satisfying specific sampling requirements among two managed cork oak stands. Analysis of variance using Fisher-Snedecor's F test (p< 0, 05) were used to identify statistically significant differences of cork quality and sylvicultural, dendrometric and cork stripping parameters between study areas within each stand and also between stands. Relationships between cork quality and sylvicultural and dendrometric parameters were also tested using Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r). The results shown that <b>sylvicultural</b> <b>practices</b> are a key factor influencing cork quality: statistically significant differences in cork thickness and crown area were observed between areas at different stand density; positive correlations were found between cork thickness and crown area in lower density study areas favouring a significant vegetative activity; negative correlations were found between the parameters of cork stripping (cork stripping coefficient, cork stripping surface, maximum height of cork stripping) and cork thickness. No correlations were found between cork porosity and dendrometric or sylvicultural parameters, demonstrating the probable genetic origin of cork porosity...|$|R
40|$|Rationale Fast {{increase}} of world population {{leads to a}} correlative increase on wood demand (heating, pulp and paper, building). Consequently, the cultivated forest has a leading role to play to fill this growing demand. Developing an abundant wood ressource calls for improvement of <b>sylvicultural</b> <b>practices</b> as well as deployment of genetically improved trees varieties {{in the frame of}} a sustainable forestry. Maintaining french forest competitivity will depend on the integration of new technologies in breeding programs, especially for intensively cultivated forest species such as maritime pine (Pinus pinaster). Second generation sequencing platforms provide tremendous and relatively cheap amounts of data to biologists. However, the main characteristic of this data is to be extremely puzzled with about 20 millions of short sequences averaging 100 bp length per sample. Aligning such data along a reference genome is a routine task nowadays. But in the case of maritime pine, de novo assembling of a transcriptome (i. e. without reference genome) from the 300 millions of sequences available, mixing 1 % of Sanger and 454 long sequences and 99 % of such short reads, is quite challenging and calls for delicate algorithmic approaches (Wall et al. 2009). Nevertheless, applying short sequences to transcriptomics is already possible (Wheat 2010) using for instance informations provided by orthologous genes (Birzele et al. 2010) and promises to be an acceptable experimental solution for many non-model agronomical species. Many different algorithms for transcriptome assembly are available (Miller et al. 2010, Surget-Groba & Montoya-Burgos 2010). Kumar & Blaxter (2010) compared CAP 3, MIRA 3, Newbler, SeqMan and CLC for the de novo assembly of Litomosoides sigmodontis nematode transcriptome. In the latter paper, an interesting idea was to fuse different assemblies to maximise cooperation of different algorithms in the final assembly. Aims In this poster, we will describe a preliminary assembly of 454 sequences by TGICL (Pertea et al. 2003) and we propose to study the usability of several tools of transcriptome assembly, such as MIRA 3 (Chevreux et al. 2004), Velvet (Zerbino & Birney 2008), ABySS (Birol et al. 2009) and SOAPdeNovo (Li et al. 2010), integrating massive short reads, and define an acceptable method to apply to maritime pine transcriptomics...|$|R
40|$|Timber is {{traditionally}} {{the main purpose}} of Douglas-fir in Europe. However, some uncertainties remain concerning the sylviculture that should be applied in order to maximise girth growth rate (GR) without affecting the good mechanical properties of the wood. So, the present study aimed at assessing to what extent the GR of Douglas-firs grown in Wallonia influences the mechanical properties of wood clear samples. The modulus of elasticity (E) and static bending strength (σf) were measured according to NF B 51 - 016 and NF B 51 - 008 and are discussed according to the ring width measured on the samples, {{as well as on the}} growth rate of the trees and of the stands, for both juvenile and mature wood. This assessment will help to provide sylviculture guidelines for foresters. The experimental material was derived from 11 Douglas-fir stands distributed all over Wallonia, Southern Belgium. At the time of felling, the age of the stands ranged from 41 to 69 years old. In each stand, six trees were felled, their girth varying from 120 cm to 179 cm. As a consequence of the sampling methodology the growth rate of the trees ranged from 3 mm to 7 mm. From the 66 butt logs, 274 and 884 clear samples were taken in the juvenile and mature wood respectively. This research evidenced that: -	Whatever the GR, the mean values of E and σf in the juvenile wood are 20 % lower than those in the mature wood; -	At the tree level, the mean E and σf of the samples taken from trees with ring width> 5 mm are about 10 % lower than those of the samples taken from trees with ring width 3 cm/year are respectively 5 % and 9 % lower than those of the samples originating from stands with mean girth increment < 3 cm/year. This observation should lead the forest manager to consider carefully <b>sylvicultural</b> <b>practices</b> that would induce a too fast juvenile growth; high growth rate in the mature wood do not appear to be a problem considering the properties studied here. One should however take into account the impact of the growth rate on the singularities of the boards...|$|R
40|$|<b>Sylvi{{cultural}}</b> and Cultural <b>Practices</b> in Agroforestry Parklands According to a North-South Rainfall Gradient in Maradi Region, Niger. A {{study on}} <b>sylvicultural</b> and cultural <b>practices</b> in the parklands {{was conducted in}} three village territories of Maradi region following a rainfall gradient. Surveys conducted with farmers coupled with sylvicultural data collection are used as the methodological tools. The results showed that farmers` managed natural regeneration in the village territories has lasted at least 10 years. It is practiced by imitating relatives and neighbors or initiated by development projects or extension services. The reasons that guided farmers to care and protect trees are wood provision to households, soil fertilization, fodder, and pharmacopeia and erosion control. Plant diversity is more important in Moulmouchi than Batchaka and Koda. Also, species with high agronomic, economic and food values are preferred by farmers. The different sylvicultural operations {{carried out in the}} village territories indicate that farmers pay attention to the protection and management of trees in their farms. Some species like Acacia senegal, Azadirachta indica and Adansonia digitata inventoried in the farms have been planted and conserved with others from natural regeneration. Sylvicultural and cultural operations used by farmers for tree management in the fields are many and diverse. The more used operations are improved clearing, pruning and by staking plant. Nevertheless, farmers use some practices which do not favour the preservation of trees in the farms. Some of them are abusive cutting, groundnut growing, bark removal, use of animals for plowing and illegal cutting of trees by transhumant herders. Pharmacopeia, construction and energy, fodder, human food are the principal uses of tree species in this region. The most harvested tree organs are wood, leaves, fruits and barks. Benefits derived from trees are what make farmers to manage and protect trees in their farms without external intervention...|$|R
40|$|The western {{lowland gorilla}} (Gorilla gorilla gorilla Savage & Wyman) (WLG) which is {{considered}} as a critically endangered species by IUCN, could play a fundamental function in seeds dispersal of several plant species. This {{could be related to}} its frugivorous diet, its stomach capacity and the long gut retention time of the ingested food, its extensive daily path length, and its ability to swallow seeds of variable sizes. In addition, this animal tends to deposit most of ingested seeds in suitable habitats (especially logging gaps and old logging roads) for light-demanding plant development. This research will be conducted within the moist evergreen forest of Central Gabon in a logging concession granted to the company CEB Precious Woods. A preliminary study was undertaken as a Master thesis. It was aiming at obtaining a first insight of interactions between WLG and timber exploitation in Central Gabon and at assessing {{the extent to which they}} may benefit of each other. WLG abundances were estimated in unlogged and logged sites in the concession, and nesting behavior described. Seeds dispersed during the study period (February-May) by WLG were identified through fecal analysis. Relatively high WLG abundances were observed in the concession. WLG were found to nest preferentially in open areas and to frequently use old logging road network for nesting and feeding. Sixteen species were observed to be dispersed by WLG. Seeds of the most abundant species, Santiria trimera, were subjected to four treatments: (1) passed seeds, (2) passed seeds in fecal matrix, (3) seeds surrounded by fresh pulp and (3) seeds extracted from fresh fruits. The germination successes of S. trimera were significantly higher after gut passage partly thanks to fruit pulp removal. Our PhD study aims to characterize the functional ecology of WLG in tropical forests dynamics, especially regarding logging biotopes. Our research will be organized in three parts: (1) the survey of gorilla populations in the study area coupled with the characterization of their nests and habitats, (2) the study of dispersed species and of the effect of passage through gorilla gut on seed germination, (3) the estimate of dispersal distances for the species Santiria trimera (Burseraceae) by using molecular markers. Data for the second and third parts will be collected in one site selected thanks to the results of the survey for its high gorilla density, to assess the following assumptions: (1) gorillas favor the regeneration of many plant species, including timber trees; (2) they improve the genetic diversity and limit the genetic structure by widening the genetic pool and dispersing diasporas on large distances. If these hypotheses are accepted, <b>sylvicultural</b> <b>practices</b> may be adapted so as to take advantage from the presence of gorilla population...|$|R
