Pitch assignments have been suggested for these instruments based on <b>scalings</b> provided by Douwes. Most modern instruments are full-sized ones at 8′ pitch or ottavini at 4′ pitch, although there are no surviving Ruckers instruments of this pitch, and most probably none were ever made by his workshop.|$|E

50|$|Angles and {{ratios of}} {{distances}} are invariant under <b>scalings,</b> rotations, translations and reflections. These transformations produce similar shapes, {{which is the}} basis of trigonometry. For example, no matter how a triangle is transformed, the sum of its interior angles is always 180°.

This then becomes a necessary condition on a smooth function F to have the homogeneity property; it is also sufficient (by using Schwartz distributions one can reduce the mathematical analysis considerations here). This setting is typical, in that there is a one-parameter group of <b>scalings</b> operating; and the information is coded in an infinitesimal transformation that is a first-order differential operator.|$|E
50|$|A tangent line t to {{a circle}} C {{intersect}}s the circle {{at a single}} point T. For comparison, secant lines intersect a circle at two points, whereas another line may not intersect a circle at all. This property of tangent lines is preserved under many geometrical transformations, such as <b>scalings,</b> rotation, translations, inversions, and map projections. In technical language, these transformations do not change the incidence structure of the tangent line and circle, even though the line and circle may be deformed.|$|E
