5|$|Developing as a {{tropical}} depression near Nassau in the Bahamas on September 12, Felice had {{its origins in}} a persistent upper-level trough over the area. The nascent depression tracked <b>slowly</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> west-southwest without much intensification, ultimately passing just north of Key West, Florida as it entered the Gulf of Mexico. Over the open waters of the Gulf, the system accelerated toward the west-northwest along the southern periphery of a large ridge of high pressure to the north. While reconnaissance aircraft data on the storm suggested that the depression strengthened into {{a tropical}} storm midday on September 14, the official Atlantic tropical cyclone database known as HURDAT indicates the disturbance attained tropical storm status at 0000 UTC on September 15.|$|E
5|$|The South Vietnamese M113s had {{no problem}} {{crossing}} the generally shallow streams and rivers typical of the Mekong Delta, but the heavy 10-ton M113s became bogged down in the deeper Cong Ba Ky Canal, forcing the crews and the infantry company on board to cut down brush and trees and fill the canal until it was shallow enough for the M113s to cross. The rescue operation was further delayed when Ba tried to obtain proper authorization to advance, because he was under orders not to take commands directly from the American advisers. Vann, who was flying above the armored formation, demanded that Ba advance immediately. Ba replied {{that he would not}} take instructions from Americans. When Vann threatened to have Ba shot, he reluctantly continued to advance, although very <b>slowly,</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> entrenched Viet Cong.|$|E
25|$|When {{a female}} comes to mate, she {{lands on the}} perch site. The male will then either lunge or walk <b>slowly</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> female. The male mounts the female for {{approximately}} 8 seconds and extends its curled antennae and draws the female antennae upward in a behavior called lassoing. Following mating, females will walk {{over the surface of}} the perch site, dragging their abdomens, before flying off.|$|E

6000|$|... "I surrender!" [...] he cried, and, {{still with}} his arms above his head, and his face whiter than the distant sands, he <b>slowly</b> walked <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> barrier.|$|R
25|$|The {{pendulum}} is withdrawn {{into the}} ceiling, {{and the walls}} become red-hot and start to move inwards, forcing him <b>slowly</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> {{center of the room}} and the pit. As he loses his last foothold and begins to topple in, he hears a roar of voices and trumpets, the walls retract, and an arm pulls him to safety. The French Army has captured the city of Toledo and the Inquisition has fallen into its enemies' hands.|$|E
25|$|On 22 July, NLA insurgent {{positions}} in the villages north of Tetovo, {{as well as in}} the Drenovec suburb, started a massive onslaught against the Macedonian police near the villages as well as inside Tetovo. The attacks started at 11:00 with an attack on the police positions at the city stadium, Drenovec 2, and the army barracks on the outskirts of the city. The police answered fire leading to an outburst of heavy fighting. Fighting continued uninterrupted for a second day, and the insurgents moved <b>slowly</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> city stadium, and Drenovec 2 suburb, and approached the city centre. On the same day the Defence Minister warned the NLA to withdraw from ground it had taken during the truce or face an all-out attack.|$|E
500|$|The {{depression}} moved <b>slowly</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> {{southwest and}} became better organized, despite {{a decrease in}} the coverage of deep convection. By late September 28 the depression was approaching tropical storm status; it turned to the northwest and attained winds of [...] at 0600 UTC on September 29, at which time it was assigned the name Otis. That evening, wind shear relented and conditions became more favorable for the storm's intensification. Convection wrapped almost fully around the center, and early on September 3, Otis was upgraded to a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffirâ€“Simpson Hurricane Scale. Shortly thereafter, a ragged eye feature developed; it quickly became better defined as it entered the scope of weather radar in Cabo San Lucas.|$|E
60|$|Silence. Conger shifted, waiting. His fingers moved <b>slowly</b> <b>toward</b> his belt. <b>The</b> Sheriff glanced down. He grunted.|$|R
60|$|Andrew {{waved his}} arm, and, {{trimming}} the jib over, drove the Rowan ahead. As he did so, the steamer's screw splashed round {{half out of}} water, and she <b>slowly</b> turned <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> north.|$|R
60|$|He {{walked back}} to the cabin; and the new cook was <b>slowly</b> pushed <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> galley by the second officer, the new A. B., under the same gentle guidance, being {{conducted}} back to the forecastle.|$|R
500|$|In {{the first}} week of May2015, a strong cold front became {{stationary}} {{to the north of the}} Greater Antilles, where warm ocean waters dissipated the temperature gradient across the front. The western section of the front drifted westward as a surface trough of low pressure. Arriving at the Bahamas by May 5, the trough was attended by an expanse of showers and thunderstorms extending from the northwestern Caribbean Sea to southern Florida. A sharp mid- to upper-level trough interacted with the system and facilitated gradual cyclogenesis, and early on May 6, a distinct, non-tropical center of low pressure developed off southeastern Florida. Tracking <b>slowly</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> north over the next two days, the system showed signs of increased organization, and a Hurricane Hunter aircraft found tropical storm-force winds to the north and west of the center on May 7. With the development of deep convection, the system was classified Subtropical Storm Ana at 00:00 UTC on May 8, while situated about [...] to the south-southeast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Due to its involvement with the upper trough, as well as its large wind field, the system was considered subtropical, as opposed to fully tropical.|$|E
2500|$|While on the {{practice}} field, the guardsmen generally faced the parking lot which was about [...] away. At one point, some of them knelt and aimed their weapons toward the parking lot, then stood up again. At one point the guardsmen formed a loose huddle {{and appeared to be}} talking to one another. They had cleared the protesters from the Commons area, and many students had left, but some stayed and were still angrily confronting the soldiers, some throwing rocks and tear gas canisters. About 10 minutes later, the guardsmen began to retrace their steps back up the hill toward the Commons area. Some of the students on the Taylor Hall veranda began to move <b>slowly</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> soldiers as they passed {{over the top of the}} hill and headed back into the Commons.|$|E
2500|$|Barnett {{joined the}} faculty of Columbia University as {{professor}} of government in 1961. In 1966 he was a principal witness for an extensive Congressional review of China policy conducted by Senator J. William Fulbright, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. At that time China was regarded primarily as an enemy, particularly for its support of North Vietnamese expansion. China was feared as a revolutionary force seeking to topple democratic governments, which would fall like a row of dominoes. Barnett told the committee that China's initial reaction to American overtures was [...] "almost certain to be negative and hostile and that any changes in our posture will create some new problems, but ... initiatives on our part clearly are required {{if we are to}} work, however <b>slowly,</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> long term goal of a more stable, less explosive situation in Asia and to explore the possibilities of trying to moderate Peking's policies." [...] In 1969, Barnett moved to the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) at the Johns Hopkins University, where he remained until he retired in 1989.|$|E
60|$|Reluctantly, the {{soldiers}} regrouped. The leadys watched without emotion {{as the men}} marched <b>slowly</b> back <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> warehouse. Franks and Moss and Taylor led them across the ground, glancing alertly at the leadys as they walked.|$|R
6000|$|... "What's your name?" [...] he asked, as {{he moved}} <b>slowly</b> <b>toward</b> one of <b>the</b> benches, with an air which invited the bootblack to sit down.|$|R
60|$|The old chief <b>slowly</b> {{advanced}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Christian Indians. He laid {{aside his}} knife and tomahawk, {{and then his}} eagle plumes and war-bonnet. Bareheaded, he seated himself among the converted redmen. They began chanting in low, murmuring tones.|$|R
2500|$|The Tsar was met on {{the morning}} of his {{coronation}} at the Kremlin Palace's Red Porch, where he took his place beneath a large canopy held by thirty-two Russian generals, with other officers providing additional support. [...] Accompanied by his wife (under a separate canopy) and the regalia, he proceeded <b>slowly</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Cathedral of the Dormition, where his anointing and crowning would take place. [...] Among the items of regalia in the parade were the Chain of the Order of St. Andrew the First-Called for the Tsaritsa, the Sword of State, the Banner of State, the State Seal, the Purple Robe for the Tsar, the Orb, the Sceptre, the Small Imperial Crown and the Great Imperial Crown, all arranged in a strict order. [...] Aides-de-camp to the Tsar, generals of the Suite and the Horse Guards troop lined up along the route, from the Red Porch to the Cathedral. The Hof-Marshal, the Hof-Marshal in Chief and the Supreme Marshal, each with a mace in his hand, silently joined the procession, which also boasted the Ministers of the War Office and Imperial Court, the Commander of the Imperial Residence, the Adjutant General of the Day, the orderly Major General of the Suite and the Commander of the Horse Guards regiment, among others.|$|E
2500|$|About {{four o'clock}} in the afternoon, while Thomas A. Hendricks was {{speaking}} at the Democrat state convention, of which there were 10,000 participants, some eight or ten soldiers with bayonets fixed and rifles cocked entered the crowd and advanced <b>slowly</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> stand, causing a great uproar. [...] The multitude scattered in every direction. A high fence {{on the east side}} of the state-house square was pushed down by the rushing crowd. A squad of cavalry galloped along Tennessee street adding to the tumult. The soldiers who were moving towards the stand were ordered to halt by Colonel Coburn, who had been guarding the quartermaster's stores north of the State-house, but who came out when he heard the disturbance. He asked what they were doing. They said they were [...] "going for Tom Hendricks," [...] that he had said too much, and they intended to kill him. Coburn expostulated with them and they desisted. There was much confusion on the stand. Hendricks closed his remarks prematurely, suggesting that the resolutions be read and the meeting dismissed. The resolutions declared that the Federal government had two wars upon its hands, one against the rebels and one against the constitution. The Republicans in the late legislature, who had broken the quorum, were denounced, and it was declared that the Governor could not clear himself from complicity, except by taking steps to prevent repudiation.|$|E

60|$|Isaac's {{hand was}} still extended. This {{time he had}} lowered the muzzle of his pistol. The {{inspector}} was only human and he paused, for he was looking straight {{into the mouth of}} it. Isaac <b>slowly</b> backed <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door.|$|R
6000|$|<b>The</b> marquis <b>slowly</b> walked <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door, and Newman, following, {{opened it}} for him. [...] "What you propose to do {{will be very}} disagreeable," [...] M. de Bellegarde said. [...] "That is very evident. But it will be nothing more." ...|$|R

60|$|She {{slipped away}} and {{disappeared}} into her house. John drove <b>slowly</b> back <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Milan. Just as he was turning in, a little waterproofed figure from the pavement waved her hand and called to him. He drew up and she hastened to his side.|$|R

60|$|The churchyard {{gate was}} {{opened and closed}} noisily. They both glanced up. Stephen Strangewey was coming <b>slowly</b> <b>toward</b> them along <b>the</b> flinty path. Louise, {{suddenly}} herself again, rose briskly to her feet.|$|R
6000|$|... "Say, I'm sorry." [...] She {{spoke with}} a genuineness of feeling that {{surprised}} him. He went <b>slowly,</b> almost apologetically <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door.|$|R
