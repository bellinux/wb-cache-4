5000|$|The {{traditional}} western cinch {{was made}} of multiple strands of heavy cords, usually made of mohair, or, in cheaper designs, cotton. Modern designs are also made of synthetic fiber or a synthetic-mohair blend. The number of cords used varies with width and design, but the standard range is from 17 to 30 strands, creating an end product that is 4 to 7 inches wide at the widest point {{in the center of}} the cinch. This design is sometimes known as a [...] "string", [...] "strand," [...] "cord" [...] or [...] "rope" [...] cinch. Each cord is knotted around a large ring, called a cinch ring, placed at either end. In the center, additional cording or very heavy thread is used to gather all the cords into a <b>set</b> <b>width</b> and make the cinch lie flat. Wider cinches are narrowed to fit the cinch ring by allowing two layers of cord to form at the ring, sometimes aided by decorative weaving that stabilizes the cords.|$|E

This set is called common <b>set</b> (of constant <b>width</b> d 1) of the collection. These results deal with an open question raised by Buchman and Valentine in [Croft, Falconer and Guy, Unsolved Problems in Geometry, Springer-Verlag New York, Inc. 1991, pp. 131 - 132]. Moreover, given an oracle which accepts n + 1 sets of a collection of compact convex sets in IE n and either returns a <b>set</b> of <b>width</b> d (a <b>set</b> of constant <b>width</b> d) contained in these sets, or reports its non-existence, we present an algorithm which determines a common set of the collection...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper reports {{experimental}} {{data on the}} wear of high-speed steel bimetal bandsaw blades cutting austenitic 17 - 7 stainless steel bars. Several different methods of assessing the wear modes and mechanisms are evaluated; Cutting and thrust force components, <b>Set</b> <b>width,</b> Kerf width, “Out-of-square ” cutting, Wear modes and mechanisms and Chip characteristics. The wear mode established in the current work when bandsawing austenitic stainless steel with a bimetal blade is flank and corner wear together with formation of a cutting edge radius. The cutting edge radius increases as the wear progresses, reaching 25 - 50 mm after 300 cut sections. The established wear mechanism for {{the initial stages of}} wear is mild adhesive wear of the flank surface together with built-up edge formation and break-down. As the wear reaches steady-state the mechanism is adhesive wear of the flank surface with tempering/softening of high-speed steel layers. When the wear reached the steady-state region the level of thrust and cutting force were equal and relatively high. The kerf width appears to be less than the total <b>set</b> <b>width</b> of the blade, meaning that there is compression of the set teeth as they pass through the kerf. There is segmented chip formation with an increasing amount of vibration as the teeth wear, probably due to the increasing size of cutting edge radius.

40|$|Character {{placement}} in digital typography is commonly {{defined in terms}} of a set of parameters (font metrics) that specify the relative locations of the local coordinate systems of adjacent characters in a line of text. The primary font metrics for horizontal letterspacing are the character set widths and sidebearings and the character pair spacing adjustments (kerning terms). A typical parameter for vertical alignment is the character depth below baseline. This paper discusses the problem of determining font metrics from measurements on images of typeset text and develops least-squares procedures for font metric estimation. When it is known that kerning is not present, sidebearing estimation involves solving a set of linear equations, called the sidebearing normal equations. More generally, simultaneous sidebearing and kerning term estimation involves an iterative procedure in which a modified set of sidebearing normal equations is solved during each iteration. Character depth estimates are obtained by solving a set of baseline normal equations. In a preliminary evaluation of the proposed procedures on scanned text images in three fonts the root-mean-square <b>set</b> <b>width</b> estimation error was about 0. 2 pixel. A novel application of font metric estimation to text image editing is discussed...|$|E

The List module is automatically loaded, but not assigned to a global variable. It can be included in filters by calling List = require 'List'. Lists of blocks, lists of inlines, and lists of classes are now given List as a metatable, making working with them more convenient. E. g., it is now possible to concatenate lists of inlines using Lua's concatenation operator [...] (requires at least one of the operants to have List as a metatable) : function Emph (emph) local s = pandoc. Space(), pandoc. Str 'emphasized' return pandoc.

This enables the use of the resulting objects as lists. Lua/StackInstances: push Pandoc and Meta via constructor. Pandoc and Meta elements are now pushed by calling the respective constructor functions of the pandoc Lua module.
