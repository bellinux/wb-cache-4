25|$|Fernando López Tuero was an {{agricultural}} scientist and agronomist who saved the sugar industry of Puerto Rico {{when he discovered}} the bug (believed at first to be a germ) which was destroying the island's <b>sugar</b> <b>canes.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1827, Fernández {{ordered his}} 127 slaves {{to build an}} {{enormous}} windmill shaped like a tower. The windmill helped to extract the juice from the <b>sugar</b> <b>canes.</b> He still used manpower whenever the wind wasn't strong enough for to operate the windmill.

25|$|Although some sugarcanes produce seeds, modern stem cutting {{has become}} the most common {{reproduction}} method. Each cutting must contain at least one bud, and the cuttings are sometimes hand-planted. In more technologically advanced countries like the United States and Australia, billet planting is common. Billets harvested from a mechanical harvester are planted by a machine that opens and recloses the ground. Once planted, a stand can be harvested several times; after each harvest, the cane sends up new stalks, called ratoons. Successive harvests give decreasing yields, eventually justifying replanting. Two to 10 harvests are usually made {{depending on the type of}} culture. In a country with a mechanical agriculture looking for a high production of large fields, like in North America, <b>sugar</b> <b>canes</b> are replanted after two or three harvests to avoid a lowering in yields. In countries with a more traditional type of agriculture with smaller fields and hand harvesting, like in the French island la Réunion, <b>sugar</b> <b>canes</b> are often harvested up to 10 years before replanting.|$|E

25|$|The {{abundance}} {{of water and}} fertility of soil has transformed this region into a rich and well-endowed land. The variety of agricultural products such as wheat, barley, oily seeds, rice, eucalyptus, medicinal herbs; the existence of many palm and citrus farms; having mountains suitable for raising olives, and of course sugar cane - from which Khuzestan takes its name - all show the great potential of this fertile plain. In 2005, 51,000 hectares of land were planted with <b>sugar</b> <b>canes,</b> producing 350,000 tons of sugar. The {{abundance of}} water supplies, rivers, and dams, also have an influence on the fishery industries, which are prevalent in the area.|$|E
500|$|While {{drifting}} through El Salvador, {{the hurricane}} dropped immense amounts of precipitation, resulting in flash flooding and mudslides through the country. Multiple rivers, including the Río Grande de San Miguel and the Lempa River overflowed, contributing to overall damage. The flooding damaged more than 10,000 houses, leaving around 84,000 homeless and forcing 500,000 to evacuate. Crop damage was severe, with serious flooding occurring on 386 sq. miles (1000 km2) of pasture or crop land. The flooding destroyed 37% of the bean production, 19% {{of the corn}} production, and 20% losses in <b>sugar</b> <b>canes.</b> There were heavy losses in livestock as well, including the deaths of 10,000 cattle. Total agricultural and livestock damaged amounted to $154 million (1998USD). In addition, the flooding destroyed two bridges and damaged [...] of unpaved roads. In all, Mitch caused nearly $400 million in damage (1998 USD) and 240 deaths.|$|E

We conducted the trial in the Forage Sector at UN IFENAS, campus of Alfenas (MG) in 2010. The data were analy zed as completely randomized design in factorial sc heme 2 (<b>sugar</b> <b>cane</b> without lime and hydrolyzed with 1. 0 % of lime, basis of fresh matter) x 6 (six times of storage: 0, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours), with three replicate s.

2500|$|Sugar Stubbs Lane is {{situated}} in Far Banks down the A565 road towards Mere Brow. [...] The road was once a track across the marsh. In the 1980s the road was extended across the Banks Moss towards Hundred End and Tarleton.

2500|$|This {{place is}} located on the {{south-western}} part of Dasmariñas. The name [...] "Langkaan" [...] came from the word [...] "langka" [...] meaning jackfruit; which is believed to be planted in many parts of this barangay during the 1900, the year of its foundation. Barangay Langkaan was a part of a vast hacienda during the Spanich period that's why there are numerous water systems for ricefields that can be found here. The San Agustin Dam was constructed in 1855. On {{the last part of the}} 19th century, the Spaniards erected an indigo plantation here. The stone-made grinder of indigo still exists until now and it is the mark of the Spanish influence in the place. The Spaniards are the first ones who planted <b>sugar</b> <b>canes</b> and became the primary source of income during the 18th century. During those times, tarapiche and carabaos are used to make panucha and paldo. Don Placido Campos and Andres Medina are the ones who owned these tarapiche. When the Americans arrived, this place attracted residents from the Poblacion. The families Quillao, Bautista, Sarabusab, Reyes, Remulla, Sango, Laudato, Empeño, Satsatin, Medina, de Lima and others transferred here during those times. During the Second World War, the Japanese had a big plantation of cotton trees in Langkaan. Dasmarineños were forced to work here. A Japanese concentration camp was also established in this area. Now, this is considered to be a backbone of the economic progress of Dasmariñas. The presence of numerous factories in different industrial estates in this area, such as the First Cavite Industrial Estate, serves as the working place for the workers living in Dasmariñas and other towns of Cavite as well.|$|E

60|$|The {{river was}} {{acquiring}} considerable importance {{from the great}} increase of trade.

The forest had been cleared for a considerable distance round it, the former inhabitants had returned, tobacco, <b>sugar</b> <b>canes,</b> cotton, pepper, and other crops whose products were useful for trade purposes, were largely cultivated, while orchards of fruit trees had been extensively planted. Hassan reported that tribal wars had almost ceased, and that disputes were in almost all cases brought for his arbitration. Owing to the abolition of all oppressive tolls, trade from the interior had very largely increased, a great deal of tin, together with spices and other products, now finding its way down by the river. Hassan was delighted with the progress Bahi had made, and ordered that three or four boys should at once be placed for instruction under each of the men who had learned trades at Penang.|$|E
60|$|The 15th of July, I {{began my}} journey; I {{first went to}} the creek, where I had brought my rafts on shore; and {{travelling}} farther, found the tide went no higher than two miles up, {{where there was a}} little brook of running water, on the banks of which were many pleasant savannahs or meadows, plain, smooth, and covered with grass. On the rising parts, where I supposed the water did not reach, I perceived a great deal of tobacco growing to a very strong stalk. Several other plants I likewise found, the virtues of which I did not understand. I searched a long time for the Cassava root, which I knew the Indians in that climate made their bread of, but all in vain. There were several plants of aloes, though at that time I knew not what they were; likewise I saw several <b>sugar</b> <b>canes,</b> but imperfect for want of cultivation. With these few discoveries, I came back that night, and slept contentedly in my little castle.|$|E

60|$|The {{next day}} {{the work in the}} fields began. It {{consisted}} of hoeing the ground between the rows of young <b>sugar</b> <b>canes</b> and tobacco plants. The sun was extremely powerful, and the perspiration soon flowed in streams from the newcomers. They worked, however, steadily and well, and in a manner which gave satisfaction even to their master and his overseer. Harry had impressed upon his two men and Mike the importance of doing nothing which could afford their employer a fair opportunity for complaint. He would not, Harry felt sure, venture to touch them after the warning he had given, but he might send one or all of them back to the town, where they would be put to work as refractory slaves on the fortifications, and where their lot would be far harder than it would be on the plantation. He urged upon them above all things to have patience; sooner or later the people of England would, he felt sure, recall the young king, and then they would be restored to their country. But even before that some mode of escape, either by ship, or by raising an insurrection in concert with the white slaves scattered through the island, might present itself.|$|E
