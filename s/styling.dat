Teachers can incorporate learning <b>styles</b> into their classroom by identifying the learning <b>styles</b> of each of their students, matching teaching <b>styles</b> to learning <b>styles</b> for difficult tasks, strengthening weaker learning <b>styles.</b> The {{purpose of this study is}} to explain learning <b>styles,</b> teaching <b>styles</b> match or mismatch between learning and teaching <b>styles,</b> visual, auditory, and kinesthetic learning <b>styles</b> among Iranian learners, and pedagogical implications for the EFL/ESL classroom.
