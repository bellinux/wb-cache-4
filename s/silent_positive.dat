40|$|Abstract Background Pituitary adenoma {{may present}} with neuro-ophthalmic manifestations and, typically, rapid tumor {{expansion}} {{is the result}} of apoplexy. Herein, we present the first case of an isolated sixth cranial nerve palsy as initial feature of a rapidly expanding ACTH <b>positive</b> <b>silent</b> tumor without apoplexy. Case Presentation A 44 year old female with a history of sarcoidosis presented with an isolated sixth cranial nerve palsy as the initial clinical feature of a rapidly expanding ACTH <b>positive</b> <b>silent</b> pituitary adenoma. The patient underwent emergent transsphenoidal hypophysectomy for this rapidly progressive tumor and subsequently regained complete vision and ocular motility. Despite tumor extension into the cavernous sinus, the other cranial nerves were spared during the initial presentation. Conclusions This case illustrates the need to consider a rapidly growing pituitary tumor as a possibility when presented with a rapidly progressive ophthalmoplegia. </p...|$|R

The Sonic Seducer lauded singer Christianna's powerful voice {{as well as}} the guitar riffs, but wrote also that the band had still to find its own style. The German edition of Metal Hammer called it a [...] "potential sensation" [...] although the tracks were not found to be innovative.|$|R

Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic {{was less}} impressed, giving the album 2½ out of 5 stars for its [...] "gothic textures" [...] and its [...] "noisy, cluttered multi-segmented songs." [...] Similarly, David Sessions from Patrol Magazine gave the album a 4.7 out of 10 rating, calling it [...] "an unvaried ruckus sustained for 50 minutes". The album's sound was likened {{to that of}} Evanescence.|$|R

40|$|Despite {{widespread}} {{concern over}} heated diplomatic debates and {{growing interest in}} public diplomacy, it is still incompletely understood what type of message is more effective for gaining support from foreign public, or the international society, in situations where disputing countries compete in diplomatic campaigns. This study, through multiple survey experiments, uncovers the effect of being <b>silent,</b> issuing <b>positive</b> justification, and negative accusation, in interaction with the opponent's strategy. We demonstrate that negative verbal attacks work and undermine the target's popularity {{as they do in}} electoral campaigns. Unlike domestic electoral campaigns, however, negative diplomacy has little backlash and persuades people to support the attacker. Consequently, mutual verbal fights make neither party more popular than the other. Nevertheless, this does not discourage disputants from waging verbal fights due to the structure similar to the one-shot prisoner's dilemma. We also find that positive messages are highly context-dependentthat is, their effects greatly depend on the opponent's strategy and value proximity between the messenger and the receiver...|$|R

40|$|The {{threat of}} {{hepatitis}} E is being felt in blood banks in recent times. The disease is usually self-limiting, but may progress to a fulminant fatal form. We report a unique {{case of a}} hepatitis E virus (HEV) -positive asymptomatic blood donor who later developed jaundice and informed the blood bank. A blood donor passed all eligibility criteria tests and donated blood. After 20 days, the blood bank was informed by the donor that he had developed vomiting and jaundice 1 day postdonation. He was investigated by a local laboratory 1 day postdonation for liver profile, which was high. There had been a major outbreak in his community of similar symptoms during the same period. HEV IgM antibody by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was <b>positive.</b> <b>Silent</b> infections may be lurking in apparently healthy donors. Donors need to be encouraged to revert in case of any significant developments after donation and maintain open channels of communication...|$|R
30|$|From these observations, we {{conclude}} that indeed the small patterns are much more problematic for replay with inhomogeneous pattern sizes than the large patterns. To understand why, we compared {{the shape of the}} replay regions for the three distributions (a, b, and c), and observe that the slope of the lower side of the wedge is relatively insensitive to skewness, whereas the slope of the upper side of the wedge is very different in each case. Failures owing to activity explosion (the lower side of the wedge) are almost independent of the skewness, due to the instantaneous feedback inhibition in the mean field equations. On the other hand, the upper side of the wedge is determined by the network’s falling into a <b>silent</b> state. Thus, <b>positive</b> skewness (c) is the more robust distribution. Note that this was also apparent in Fig.  5, where the reduction of the region of stability with increasing inhomogeneity was much more pronounced on the upper side of the wedges than on the lower side, despite the relatively symmetric Gamma distribution used there.|$|R
40|$|Background—The ECG {{pattern of}} right bundle branch block and ST-segment {{elevation}} in leads V 1 to V 3 (Brugada syndrome) {{is associated with}} high risk of sudden death in patients with a normal heart. Current management and prognosis {{are based on a}} single study suggesting a high mortality risk within 3 years for symptomatic and asymptomatic patients alike. As a consequence, aggressive management (implantable cardioverter defibrillator) is recommended for both groups. Methods and Results—Sixty patients (45 males aged 40615 years) with the typical ECG pattern were clinically evaluated. Events at follow-up were analyzed for patients with at least one episode of aborted sudden death or syncope of unknown origin before recognition of the syndrome (30 symptomatic patients) and for patients without previous history of events (30 asymptomatic patients). Prevalence of mutations of the cardiac sodium channel was 15 %, demonstrating genetic heterogeneity. During a mean follow-up of 33638 months, ventricular fibrillation occurred in 5 (16 %) of 30 symptomatic patients and in none of the 30 asymptomatic patients. Programmed electrical stimulation was of limited value in identifying patients at risk (positive predictive value 50 %, negative predictive value 46 %). Pharmacological challenge with sodium channel blockers was unable to unmask most <b>silent</b> gene carriers (<b>positive</b> predictive value 35 %). Conclusions—At variance with current views, asymptomatic patients are at lower risk for sudden death. Programmed electrical stimulation identifies only a fraction of individuals at risk, and sodium channel blockade fails to unmask mos...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{describe}} patients’ experience of yoga as a treatment for hypertension, as well as their experience of living with hypertension. Design: Qualitative interview study Method and materials: In 2013 – 2014, in southern Sweden, patients with hypertension from three health care centres were invited to participate in a randomised controlled trial on yoga for hypertension. After completion of the study, eight women and five men (aged 35 – 79), who had practiced the yoga intervention, were interviewed about their experiences. We used a semi-structured interview guide according to Kvale. Qualitative analysis was conducted by systematic text condensation inspired by Malterud. Results: Two main themes emerged during the analysis process: Yoga – a laborious way to well-being and hypertension – a <b>silent</b> disease. The <b>positive</b> experiences of doing yoga were described in terms of tranquillity and increased agility. The drawbacks were mainly linked to the time required to perform the exercises. Living with high blood pressure and having to take medication can imply a stigma and cause concerns for future cardiovascular events. Most patients that we interviewed expressed a wish to find alternative ways to treat their high blood pressure. Participating in the yoga study was seen as a good possibility to try such an alternative way. Conclusions: Many patients with hypertension in Swedish primary care seem to be interested in trying alternative treatments to control blood pressure. The patients in our study experienced several benefits from doing yoga, but they also pointed out difficulties in implementing yoga as a regular and permanent lifestyle change...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo {{compare the}} amount of {{myocardium}} jeopardized during silent ischemia and painful ischemia, 112 consecutive patients undergoing coronary arteriography with ischemia demonstrated by exercise and redistribution tomographic thallium- 201 myocardial imaging (SPECT) {{were divided into two}} groups: 84 patients without anginal pain (silent ischemia) and 28 with pain (painful ischemia). The SPECT apical, mid and basal ventricular levels of the short-axis view and the apical portion of the long-axis view were divided into 20 segments. The results were 1) 7. 4 ± 4. 7 ischemic segments in silent ischemia and 7. 6 ± 3. 7 in painful ischemia (p = NS) with 4. 7 ± 3. 6 segments in silent ischemia undergoing total redistribution compared with 5. 4 ± 3. 4 in painful ischemia (p = NS); 2) no difference in the incidence of single, double or triple vessel disease between silent and painful ischemic groups; 3) similar anatomic distribution of ischemic segments between the two groups; 4) more positive exercise electrocardiographic (ECG) changes in painful ischemia (70 %) than in silent ischemia (32 %) (p < 0. 001) with equal amounts of ischemia associated with positive and negative exercise ECG findings. Conclusions: 1) Patients with silent and painful ischemia during exercise have similar amounts of ischemic myocardium demonstrated by tomographic thallium- 201 imaging and similar extent of angiographically documented coronary artery disease despite the absence of pain and the lower incidence of positive exercise ECG findings in <b>silent</b> ischemia. 2) <b>Positive</b> and negative exercise ECG findings were associated with similar amounts of ischemic myocardium...|$|R
40|$|Brain {{recovery}} after prolonged wakefulness {{is characterized}} by increased density, amplitude and slope of slow waves (SW, < 4 Hz) during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. These SW comprise a negative phase, during which cortical neurons are mostly <b>silent,</b> and a <b>positive</b> phase, in which most neurons fire intensively. Previous work showed, using EEG spectral analysis as an index of cortical synchrony, that Morning-types (M-types) present faster dynamics of sleep pressure than Evening-types (E-types). We thus hypothesized that single SW properties will also show larger changes in M-types than in E-types in response to increased sleep pressure. SW density (number per minute) and characteristics (amplitude, slope between negative and positive peaks, frequency and duration of negative and positive phases) were compared between chronotypes for a baseline sleep episode (BL) and for recovery sleep (REC) after two nights of sleep fragmentation. While SW density did not differ between chronotypes, M-types showed higher SW amplitude and steeper slope than E-types, especially during REC. SW properties were also averaged for 3 NREM sleep periods selected for their decreasing level of sleep pressure (first cycle of REC [REC 1], first cycle of BL [BL 1] and fourth cycle of BL [BL 4]). Slope was significantly steeper in M-types than in E-types in REC 1 and BL 1. SW frequency was consistently higher and duration {{of positive and negative}} phases constantly shorter in M-types than in E-types. Our data reveal that specific properties of cortical synchrony during sleep differ between M-types and E-types, although chronotypes show a similar capacity to generate SW. These differences may involve 1) stable trait characteristics independent of sleep pressure (i. e., frequency and durations) likely linked to the length of silent and burst-firing phases of individual neurons, and 2) specific responses to increased sleep pressure (i. e., slope and amplitude) expected to depend on the synchrony between neurons...|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{bursting}} oscillations of mammalian pancreatic beta-cells are synchronous among cells {{within an}} islet. While electrical coupling among cells via gap junctions has been demonstrated, its extent and topology are unclear. The beta-cells also share an extracellular compartment in which oscillations of K+ concentration have been measured (Perez-Armendariz and Atwater, 1985). These oscillations (1 - 2 mM) are synchronous with the burst pattern, and apparently {{are caused by}} the oscillating voltage-dependent membrane currents: Extracellular K+ concentration (Ke) rises during the depolarized active (spiking) phase and falls during the hyperpolarized silent phase. Because raising Ke depolarizes the cell membrane by increasing the potassium reversal potential (VK), any cell in the active phase should recruit nonspiking cells into the active phase. The opposite is predicted for the <b>silent</b> phase. This <b>positive</b> feedback system might couple the cells' electrical activity and synchronize bursting. We have explored this possibility using a theoretical model for bursting of beta-cells (Sherman et al., 1988) and K+ diffusion in the extracellular space of an islet. Computer simulations demonstrate that the bursts synchronize very quickly (within one burst) without gap junctional coupling among the cells. The shape and amplitude of computed Ke oscillations resemble those seen in experiments for certain parameter ranges. The model cells synchronize with exterior cells leading, though incorporating heterogeneous cell properties can allow interior cells to lead. The model islet can also be forced to oscillate at both faster and slower frequencies using periodic pulses of higher K+ in the medium surrounding the islet. Phase plane {{analysis was used to}} understand the synchronization mechanism. The results of our model suggest that diffusion of extracellular K+ may contribute to coupling and synchronization of electrical oscillations in beta-cells within an islet...|$|R
