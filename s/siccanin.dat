40|$|<b>Siccanin</b> at 3 μg/ml {{completely}} inhibited {{the growth}} of Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The primary site of action of <b>siccanin</b> on T. mentagrophytes is succinate dehydrogenase in the terminal electron transport system. At a concentration of <b>siccanin</b> giving 50 % inhibition of growth (0. 3 μg/ml), respiration of intact cells was inhibited more strongly than any other cellular functions tested, including the syntheses of cellular ribonucleic acid, deoxyribonucleic acid, phospholipid, protein, and cell wall fractions. In addition, at the same concentration <b>siccanin</b> did not cause any detectable damage in the permeability of the cells. Furthermore, the oxidation of succinate in mitochondrial preparation is {{more sensitive to the}} antibiotic than respiration in intact cells. Oxidation of other substrates tested was less sensitive to <b>siccanin</b> than that of succinate. The antibiotic inhibited both phosphorylation and oxidation, without causing changes in the P:O ratio. <b>Siccanin</b> at 0. 03 μg/ml, which caused 50 % inhibition of succinate oxidation in mitochondria, had effect neither on the exchange reaction between inorganic phosphate (Pi) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) nor on that between adenosine diphosphate and ATP. An ATP phosphohydrolase activity was also insensitive to the antibiotic. At very high concentrations, however, the antibiotic slightly inhibited the Pi-ATP exchange reaction. From those results, it was concluded that <b>siccanin</b> inhibits fungal growth by inhibiting the respiratory electron transport system...|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} antibiotics targeting to respiratory enzymes, {{we carried}} out matrix screening of a structurally varied natural compound library with Pseudomonas aeruginosa membrane-bound respiratory enzymes. We identified a succinate dehy-drogenase inhibitor, <b>siccanin</b> (IC 50, 0. 9 kM), {{which is a}} potent antibiotic against some pathogenic fungi like Trichophyton mentagrophytes and inhibits their mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase. We found that <b>siccanin</b> was effective against enzymes from P. aeruginosa, P. putida, rat and mouse mitochondria but ineffective or less effective against Escherichia coli, Corynebacterium glutamicum, and porcine mitochondria enzyme. Action mode was mixed-type for quinone-dependent activity and noncompe-titive for succinate-dependent activity, indicating {{the proximity of the}} inhibitor-binding site to the quinone-binding site. Species-selective inhibition by <b>siccanin</b> is unique among succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors, and thus <b>siccanin</b> is a potential lead compound for new chemotherapeutics...|$|E
40|$|Different {{pharmaceutical}} products with antifungal activities {{have been used}} in the treatment of mycotic types of Dermatophyte and Candida which {{play an important role in}} the occurence of a variety of clinical forms of superficial dermatomycosis. In this context, trials with an antifungal antibiotic <b>Siccanin</b> (tincture 1 % and ointment 1 %) have been carried out, the results obtained being very satisfactory (Ishibashi et aI 1970). In this clinical study which involved a total of forty patients with superficial derma-tophyte infection, twenty patients were treated with the tincture and the remaining twenty patients with the ointment. The two groups of patients were randomly selected and they received no other medication throughout the course of the trial. Method...|$|E
40|$|Aflatoxin {{production}} inhibitors, {{which do}} not inhibit the growth of aflatoxigenic fungi, {{may be used to}} control aflatoxin without incurring a rapid spread of resistant strains. A respiration inhibitor that inhibits aflatoxin production was identified during a screening process for natural, aflatoxin-production inhibitors. This prompted us to evaluate respiration inhibitors as potential aflatoxin control agents. The inhibitory activities of four natural inhibitors, seven synthetic miticides, and nine synthetic fungicides were evaluated on aflatoxin production in Aspergillus parasiticus. All of the natural inhibitors (rotenone, <b>siccanin,</b> aptenin A 5, and antimycin A) inhibited fungal aflatoxin production with IC 50 values around 10 µM. Among the synthetic miticides, pyridaben, fluacrypyrim, and tolfenpyrad exhibited strong inhibitory activities with IC 50 values less than 0. 2 µM, whereas cyflumetofen did not show significant inhibitory activity. Of the synthetic fungicides, boscalid, pyribencarb, azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, and kresoxim-methyl demonstrated strong inhibitory activities, with IC 50 values less than 0. 5 µM. Fungal growth was not significantly affected by any of the inhibitors tested at concentrations used. There was no correlation observed between the targets of respiration inhibitors (complexes I, II, and III) and their IC 50 values for aflatoxin-production inhibitory activity. This study suggests that respiration inhibitors, including commonly used pesticides, are useful for aflatoxin control...|$|E
