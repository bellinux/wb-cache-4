40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the laws of}} stable ignition of organic coal-water slurry containing petrochemicals (CWSP). The CWSP {{is based on the}} filter cake of coal and <b>scavenge</b> <b>oil.</b> The experiments are performed for individual CWSP particles soaring in a special set-up. The temperature and velocity of an oxidizer flow are varied between 500 - 1200 K, and 0. 5 - 3 m/s. The dimensions (longitudinal and transverse) of particles range are from 0. 5 mm to 5 mm. The study indicates how the shape of a fuel particle (sphere, ellipsoid, and polyhedron) influences its ignition characteristics (delay time, minimum temperature, modes, stages). Based on the experimental results, the paper explains why the surface configuration of particles influences the conditions of heat transfer with an oxidizer. The results obtained for soaring particles are compared with the results for fixed CWSP particles having different surface configurations (sphere, ellipsoid, and polyhedron). In general, the study may contribute to the expansion of the fuel resource base. The experimental data may be used {{for the development of the}} technologies of burning CWSP prepared by recycling traditional fuels.

40|$|Gas turbine aero-engines employ fast {{rotating}} shafts {{that are}} supported by bearings at several axial locations along the engine. Due to extreme load and heat, oil is injected to the bearings to aid lubrication and cooling. The oil is then shed to the bearing chamber before it is extracted out by a <b>scavenge</b> pump. <b>Scavenging</b> <b>oil</b> from the bearing chamber is challenging due to high windage induced by the fast rotating shafts {{as well as the}} two-phase nature of the flow. A deep sump has been found to increase scavenge performance due to its ability to shelter the pooled oil from the bulk rotating air flow thus minimizing two-phase mixing. However in many cases, a deep sump is not an option due to conflicting space requirements. The space limitation becomes more stringent with higher bypass ratio engines as the core becomes smaller. Therefore it is imperative to have a high performing shallow sump. However shape modification of a shallow sump is too constrained due to limited space and therefore has minimal impact on the scavenge performance. This research presents several alternative concepts to improve scavenge performance of a generic baseline shallow sump by augmenting it with attachments or inserts. These augmentations attempt to exploit two known mechanisms for reducing the residence volume: momentum reduction and sheltering. The experimental results show that some augmentations are able to reduce the residence volume of a shallow sump by up to 50 % or more in some cases...|$|R

40|$|Oil {{removal from}} {{aeroengine}} bearing chambers presents {{a challenge for}} aeroengine designers. Effective <b>scavenging</b> of <b>oil</b> is necessary to avoid excessive heat in the bearing chamber as this may lead to degradation of oil properties and deterioration in heat transfer functionality. However the task of oil removal is not trivial. Oil is entrained in a highly rotating environment induced by rotating shafts. An aeroengine scavenge pump must remove both air and oil from the chamber and {{the ratio of the}} two fluids depends on pump operating point as well as the geometry of the exit region. The University of Nottingham Technology Centre in Gas Turbine Transmission Systems is conducting an on-going experimental programme investigating liquid and gas flow behaviour in a relevant highly rotating environment. Previously reported work [2, 4] in combination with work conducted by Purdue University [3, 5] suggests that a deeper sump may help to reduce residence volume. More recently a study has been conducted that investigates geometries incorporating features sometimes included in aeroengine scavenge. Three very different exit geometries were investigated experimentally using chamber residence volume as a parameter of comparison. Data for one of these, the so called Curved Wall Deep Sump (CWDS), has already been reported in [4]. This paper presents residence volume data for all three sumps over a range of shaft speeds, inlet flow rates and scavenge ratios.

Anethum graveolens is widely consumed and its essential oils are at public reach. This {{study was designed to}} study essential oils of Anethum graveolens. Methods: The biological properties of pure and commercial essential oils of Anethum graveolens were investigated. In fact, Ferrous ion chelating activity, superoxide anion radical scavenging property, tyrosinase inhibition and total flavonoids of the oils were determined. Results: Chelating activity of 7. 8 µg of EDTA was equivalent to 2 µg of the pure oil. The oils had superoxide anion radical scavenging activities which may be related to their total phenol and flavonoid contents. IC 50 of ferrous ion chelating, antityrosiase and superoxide anion radical scavenging activities of pure and commercial oils were 1. 3, 1. 4, 1 and (171. 6, 589, 132) µg respectively.

40|$|<b>Oil</b> removal (<b>scavenge)</b> from {{aeroengine}} bearing chambers is {{an ongoing}} challenge for aeroengine designers. Effective <b>scavenging</b> of <b>oil</b> is necessary to avoid excessive heat generation, degradation of oil properties and deterioration in heat transfer functionality. However the task of oil removal is not trivial. Oil is entrained in a highly rotating environment induced by the rotating shafts. Simply removing a larger volume of fluid from the chamber with the scavenge pump can create higher air flowrates but lead to oil becoming trapped in the chamber and so no reduction in residence volume (the amount of oil present in the chamber during operation). The University of Nottingham Technology Centre in Gas Turbine Transmissions Systems has been conducting experiments investigating two phase behaviour within a simplified aeroengine bearing chamber operating at ambient pressures with water as the working liquid. The rig is constructed from polycarbonate enabling good visual access. In the chamber offtake region a number of behaviours can be observed relating to the hydraulic uplift and general flow behaviour as gas and liquid exit the chamber. Chandra et al [1] reports a parametric study using a design of experiments approach into geometrical variants of a shallow offtake region defined by curved approaches and a small offtake volume. Phenomenlogical factors were quantified and used to identify the best performing geometry. Previous work at the UTC [2, 3] has used residence volume as the primary comparative performance parameter. In this paper residence volume data is obtained for two sumps for which phenomenological data exists. The paper compares performance {{on the basis of}} these visual factors with performance on the basis of residence volume and concludes that although both frameworks have value, they do not lead to identical conclusions for all operating conditions. In film dominated cases significant hydraulic uplift usually corresponds to larger residence volume but for droplet dominated cases this is not necessarily so.

The lack of development funds in East Germany forced the continued use of a two-stroke engine in the Trabant, thus causing this vehicle to become obsolescent in the 1960s and extremely obsolete by the 1980s.|$|R
