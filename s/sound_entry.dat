40|$|Dual-element {{angle beam}} {{transducers}} exhibit operating characteristics {{suitable for a}} large range of practical field applications, particularly for the interrogation of highly attenuative materials such as stainless steel. These capabilities can be improved by operating such transducers as phased array search units, consisting of many transducer elements. Each of the array elements is pulsed with the appropriate time delays, thus controlling the shape and the sound beam direction on a large scale. This study describes the design and optimization of a multi-mode T/R (transmit/receive) phased array search unit generating longitudinal, shear and subsurface longitudinal (’creeping’) waves. The elaborated design can be operated with 12 or 16 transducer elements generating multiple wave modes for certain inspection ranges. This search unit is particularly suited for detection of surface connected planar discontinuities associated with circumferential or vertical weld seams of pressure vessels or pressure vessel components (core shroud) {{in the range of}} 1. 5 inches (~ 40 mm) wall thickness. Based on the well-known physical processes inherent to ultrasound generation in isotropic media, the Generalized Point-Source-Synthesis method (GPSS) [1, 2] has been used to model and optimize the probe. The three-dimensional transducer build-up simulation includes the reflection/refraction process at the wedge-to-material <b>sound</b> <b>entry</b> interface considering fluid coupling. The established search unit parameters consist of wedge angle, roof angle, transducer element length and width by given search unit housing dimension and a fixed inspection frequency...|$|E

40|$|This {{project is}} an {{investigation}} into sound reinforcement and the different aspects that are required in producing a successful quality of sound at a live event. The project combines the knowledge I have gained from book research with the practical field research I have conducted whilst working as a sound engineer. The first section consists of diary entries which detail the sound events I have worked at. These entries detail the equipment that was used, the acoustic qualities of the venues, the signal paths of each venues, the steps taken to produce {{the sound and the}} creative input I had as an engineer in creating a good quality <b>sound.</b> These <b>entries</b> lead on to the next section of the project that details some of the main issues I have come across during my field research. These issues include the debate of analogue equipment compared with digital equipment, PA placement and the importance of people management during an event and how this can impact the quality of the live event. Finally I hope to take my own experience in small to medium size venues and compare how this relates to the production requirements of large venues. By combining these different segments of the study, I hope to have achieved a thorough understanding of all the technical elements in play at a live event and emphasise the important part sound engineers play in the creative production of sound...|$|R
40|$|About the book] Material {{religion}} is a rapidly growing field, and this volume offers an accessible, critical entry into these new areas of research. Each "key term" uses case studies and {{is accompanied by a}} color image – an object, practice, space, or site. The entries cut across geographies, histories, and traditions, offering a versatile and engaging text for the classroom. Key topics covered include: - Icon, ritual, magic, gender, race - Sacred, spirit, technology, - Space, belief, body, brain - Taste, touch, smell, <b>sound,</b> vision Each <b>entry</b> demonstrates in clear and jargon-free prose how the key term figures prominently in understanding the materiality of religion. Written by leading international scholars, all entries are linked by the ways materiality stands {{at the forefront of the}} understanding of religion, whether that comes from humanistic, social scientific, artistic, curatorial, or other perspectives. Brent Plate brings his expertise and extensive teaching experience to the comprehensive introduction which introduces students to the themes and methods of the material cultural study of religion. ...|$|R

40|$|Lenape (also {{known as}} Delaware), an {{important}} {{language of the}} Algonquian family, was spoken originally in all of New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania, northern Delaware, and southeastern New York. The tribe was relocated in stages through western Pennsylvania, eastern Ohio, central Indiana, Missouri, Kansas, and finally Oklahoma. Members of the tribe preserved the language into the 20 th century, with the last native speaker remaining fluent until her death in 2000. The author was adopted informally into a Delaware-speaking household in 1963 {{and over the years}} gained increasing fluency in the language. The co-author began working with the author’s adoptive aunt, Nora Thompson Dean (Touching Leaves Woman) 1907 - 1984), as a graduate student and continued working jointly with another fluent speaker and with the author after the aunt’s death. Over his years of working with the aunt and other speakers, the author compiled a library of tape recordings which have become the nucleus of the Lenape Talking Dictionary website (www. talk-lenape. org). The site provides information about the speakers whose voices are heard and offers a practical orthography, as well as a survey of grammatical patterns. The site currently has about 13, 000 entries, 4, 650 of which are accompanied by sound files, and over 1, 100 sentence <b>sound</b> files. Most <b>entries</b> include a grammatical analysis showing how individual words are formed. We also have been adding lessons about the language as part of the website. Our original grant funds ran out over a year ago, but additional entries are constantly being added on a daily basis. The site is available to members of the Delaware tribe who are interested in their ancestral language and to scholars and members of the general public who wish to learn about the language. The author and co-author will show images from the site and demonstrate how the site is set up, and how it offers a self-guided learning opportunity. The project was {{supported by a grant from}} the National Science Foundation...|$|R
