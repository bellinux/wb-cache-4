5|$|Ángel Román Martínez {{competed for}} Puerto Rico in taekwondo. Born in 1984, Román entered Beijing at age 24, {{competing}} in the men's welterweight class (which includes athletes under 80kilograms in weight). Román had not previously competed in any Olympic games or events. During {{the course of the}} competition's first round, which took place on August 22, Román faced Canada's Sébastien Michaud in the sixth match. The Puerto Rican judoka won a total of two deuk-jeom (points), with one in the first round and one in the third round, but lost a deuk-jeom to a deduction. His Canadian opponent scored a total of three deuk-jeom, but lost one to a deduction. Thus, as Michaud ended with a <b>score</b> <b>higher</b> than Román's score, Michaud won the round. Román did not advance to later rounds.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose was}} to examine the sport orientations and goal {{perspectives}} of wheelchair adult athletes who differed on gender and type of sport. Participants were 34 male and 14 female marathoners and 166 male and 29 female basketball players. Instruments were the Sport Orientation Questionnaire (SOQ) and the Task and Ego Orientation in Sport Questionnaire (TEOSQ). Separate 2 x 2 (Gender x Sport) multivariate analysis of variance revealed that on the SOQ, males <b>scored</b> <b>higher</b> on competitive orientation, females <b>scored</b> <b>higher</b> on goal orientation, and no gender differences occurred on win orientation. Basketball players <b>scored</b> <b>higher</b> on win orientation, marathoners <b>scored</b> <b>higher</b> on goal orientation, and no differences occurred between sport groups on competitiveness orientation. On the TEOSQ, there were no gender differences;; marathoners <b>scored</b> <b>higher</b> on ego orientation, and no differences occurred between sport groups on task orientation...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to analyze the {{differences}} between adolescents <b>scoring</b> <b>high</b> and low on school violence in the following areas: individual (self-esteem, loneliness, satisfaction with life, and empathy); family (family climate, communication with father and mother); academic (classroom climate, attitudes toward authority, and sociometric status); and community (community involvement, community participation, social support from formal systems, and social support from informal systems). Differences in these relationships between boys and girls <b>scoring</b> <b>high</b> on school violence were also examined. Participants in the study were 1723 adolescents, aged 12 to 18 years old, in four secondary schools. Multivariate and univariate analysis of variance were performed. Results showed that adolescents with high levels of school violence <b>scored</b> <b>higher</b> on loneliness, depressive symptomatology, offensive and avoidance communication with father and mother, family conflict, and attitude towards transgression, as compared to adolescents with low levels of school violence. Furthermore, girls <b>scoring</b> <b>high</b> on school violence reported <b>higher</b> <b>scores</b> on academic self-esteem, empathy, and sociometric status, and lower scores on open communication with father and community participation, as compared to boys <b>scoring</b> <b>high</b> in school violence.

Further testing following his arrest indicated a verbal I.Q. of 64 and non-verbal reasoning and cognitive functioning of 68, giving a full scale I.Q. of 66, an age equivalent of 11 years in the 10th percentile (90% of 11-year-olds would <b>score</b> <b>higher).</b>|$|E

40|$|Background/PurposeThe recent {{imbalance}} {{in the labor}} market structure of medical specialists can cause problems in access to care, and result in lower quality and increased costs of medical care. The labor market structure of medical specialists requires discussion in relation to specialty selection and personality traits. This study examined the relationship between personality traits and specialist selection among medical students. MethodsThis study used the Edwards Personal Preference Schedule and a customized questionnaire. The participants were 358 medical students of the College of Medicine at Chang Gung University. ResultsMedical students <b>scored</b> the <b>highest</b> in Intraception and the lowest in Deference. Women <b>scored</b> significantly <b>higher</b> compared to men for Intraception, Succorance, and Change, whereas men <b>scored</b> significantly <b>higher</b> than women for Dominance and Heterosexuality. Medical students who have family or friends who are also physicians <b>scored</b> <b>higher</b> in Affiliation and lower in Deference than other medical students. Medical students who did not participate in extracurricular activities <b>scored</b> <b>higher</b> in Aggression than those who did. Fourth-year medical students <b>scored</b> significantly <b>higher</b> in Succorance than 7 th-year medical students. A significant difference was found among medical students of different specialties regarding Exhibition, Autonomy, Intraception, Succorance, and Nurturance. Surgery students <b>scored</b> significantly <b>higher</b> in Exhibition than general medicine students. Students who chose a specialty <b>scored</b> <b>higher</b> in Autonomy than general medicine students. General medicine students <b>scored</b> <b>higher</b> in Intraception and Succorance than surgery students. ConclusionThe results of this study {{can be used as a}} frame of reference in the field of medical education or in the formulation of governmental policies regarding physician human resource management...|$|R

25|$|A {{more recent}} study {{suggests}} that EI {{is not necessarily a}} universally positive trait. They found a negative correlation between EI and managerial work demands; while under low levels of managerial work demands, they found a negative relationship between EI and teamwork effectiveness. An explanation for this may suggest gender differences in EI, as women tend to <b>score</b> <b>higher</b> levels than men. This furthers the idea that job context plays a role in the relationships between EI, teamwork effectiveness, and job performance. Another interesting find was discussed in a study that assessed a possible link between EI and entrepreneurial behaviors and success.|$|E
