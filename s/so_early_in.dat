Niemann, and Townsend were all {{selected}} along with Humber in the first eight picks of the 2004 MLB Draft— the first time three teammates had ever gone <b>so</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> the same draft. Only twice had three teammates been taken in the first round, most recently when Steve Hosey, Tom Goodwin and Eddie Zosky of the Fresno State Bulldogs were selected {{in the first round of}} the 1989 Major League Baseball draft. Teammate David Aardsma, a relief pitcher, was also selected in the first round.|$|E
5|$|The {{candidate}} that wins {{the election and}} assumes office is eventual President of South Korea Cho Myung-ho (Lee Jung-gil). His administration begins with his undertaking the grand task of forwarding talks of reunification between the North and South after witnessing the grim reality that is the struggle between the two nations. With strong ambitions, he leads diplomatic outreaches with the North that no one expected of a candidate <b>so</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> his term.|$|E

5|$|On September 15, Obama {{attended}} a Philadelphia fundraising dinner for Specter, an unusually public {{declaration of support}} <b>so</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> the primary season, when the President has the option of remaining neutral until the final outcome becomes clearer. Governor Rendell said that Obama and Biden felt obligated to strongly support Specter because they so strongly lobbied him to switch parties. Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter and radio personality Michael Smerconish also spoke on Specter's behalf. Senate Majority Leader Reid took the unusual steps of scheduling no Senate votes that day so both Specter and Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, Jr. could attend the fundraiser. That move drew criticism from Republicans, {{as well as from}} Sestak, who felt Specter was skirting his Senate responsibilities, yet hypocritically criticizing Sestak at the same time for missing more than 100 votes in the U.S. House. The event was expected to raise about $2.5 million, which was to be split between Specter's campaign and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. After the fundraiser, Obama and Specter traveled via Air Force One to Pittsburgh to address labor activists at the AFL-CIO convention. There, Specter assured the audience he would support the Employee Free Choice Act, a proposed bill that would make union formation easier, which Specter had previously opposed as a Republican.|$|E
25|$|Davis began {{fundraising}} for his 2002 {{reelection campaign}} {{early in his}} governorship. Davis raised $13.2 million in 1999 and $14.2 million in 2000, both unprecedented sums at the time <b>so</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> an elected term. Davis' 1999 and 2000 contributions included contributions from Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison International. Davis also received large contributions from labor groups, environmental groups and individuals.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of Vernanimalcula <b>so</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> {{the fossil record}} was believed to have had important implications if it were really bilaterian. The radiation of animals into many phyla would have occurred before any animal became much larger than microscopic size, making the sudden {{appearance of}} many animal phyla in the Cambrian explosion an illusion and merely represented a (geologically) sudden increase in size {{and the development of}} easily fossilised body parts by species in existing phyla.|$|E

25|$|Because {{they were}} {{superseded}} <b>so</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> their lives by more modern forms of traction, {{and because they}} spent {{so much of their}} remaining lives stored for seasonal grain traffic and/or in poor condition, the R class achieved one of the lowest average mileages of any VR locomotive. The lowest was that of R 716, which recorded just 88,909 miles (143,085km) in just four years of service before being withdrawn in 1956 and scrapped in 1962.|$|E
25|$|By now {{the murders}} had {{attracted}} widespread media attention and many students were taking extra precautions, such as changing their daily routines and sleeping together in groups. Because the spree was happening <b>so</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> the fall semester, some students withdrew their enrollment or transferred to other schools. Twenty-three year old Tracy Paules {{was living with}} Manny Taboada, also 23, her burly 200lb roommate. On Monday, August 27, Rolling broke into the apartment by prying open {{the sliding glass door}} with the same tools he had used previously. Rolling found Taboada asleep in one of the bedrooms and, after a struggle with the young man, eventually killed him.|$|E
25|$|Tom van Vollenhoven the brush-cut wing who {{appeared}} on the scene in 1955, was the kind of player who captured the imagination every time he touched the ball. His try for the Light Blues against the Junior Springboks in 1955, when he beat one player after another in spectacular a zigzag run of almost 80 metres, is still lauded as the try of all tries. This got him into the Springbok side against the 1955 British Lions of Robin Thomson and in the second test scored a hat trick of tries. He would probably {{have been one of the}} greatest heroes if he had not gone off to play professional rugby league in England <b>so</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> his career.|$|E

Defeated semi finalists, Kornel Sandor from Hungary and Daniel Martins from France, won bronze medals.|$|R
50|$|On 1 November 2010, it was {{reported}} on the Isle of Man Newspapers website, that the Steam Packet had lost two major freight customers to rival company Mezeron who had just {{set up a new}} freight service between Douglas and Liverpool a week or <b>so</b> <b>earlier.</b> <b>In</b> February 2011 Mezeron withdrew the service citing lack of growth in the market. Previously the Steam Packet Company had reported a loss of 15% of its total freight business to Mezeron.|$|R
25|$|There is {{no other}} 17th-century artist who {{employed}} the exorbitantly expensive pigment lapis lazuli (natural ultramarine) either so lavishly or <b>so</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> his career. Vermeer used this in not just elements that are naturally of this colour; the earth colours umber and ochre should be understood as warm light within a painting's strongly lit interior, which reflects its multiple colours onto the wall. In this way, he created a world more perfect than any he had witnessed. This working method most probably was inspired by Vermeer’s understanding of Leonardo’s observations that the surface of every object partakes of the colour of the adjacent object. This means that no object is ever seen entirely in its natural colour.|$|E
25|$|The Texans {{ended up}} having to wait until Week 5 against the Indianapolis Colts to have their home opener, the latest an NFL team went into the season before playing at home since the New Orleans Saints played their entire {{schedule}} {{on the road in}} 2005 due to the damages of the city of New Orleans as a result of Hurricane Katrina. (Every other NFL team had at least one home game by the end of Week 2.) With the Ravens eventually advancing to the AFC Championship Game against the rival Pittsburgh Steelers (and having to enter the playoffs as a wild card team), the impromptu decision to give the Ravens and Texans their bye week <b>so</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> the season {{ended up having}} the unintended effect of the Ravens playing in an NFL-record 18 consecutive weeks without a break in the schedule.|$|E
25|$|Rockford and {{surrounding}} areas {{are prone to}} violent thunderstorms during the months of March, April, May, and June. On April 21, 1967, the neighboring town of Belvidere {{was struck by a}} violent F4 tornado, in which twenty-four people were killed and hundreds more injured at Belvidere's High School. Other severe weather events, such as hail and strong winds are common in these storms. On July 5, 2003 at 04:13, supercells produced tornadoes causing widespread damage on both the east and west sides of Rockford. Approximately 70,000 people were without power, with many on the west side suffering in the heat without electricity for a week. It took months for the damage to be completely cleared, but because the storm struck <b>so</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> the morning there were no injuries or fatalities. However, these sometimes violent storms bring the majority of summer rainfall.|$|E
60|$|At any rate, on the Mariposa Belle {{first one}} {{and then the other}} heard that the steamer was sinking. As far as I could ever learn the first of it was that George Duff, the bank manager, came very quietly to Dr. Gallagher and asked him if he thought that the boat was sinking.

25|$|This {{division}} into ecclesiastical provinces did {{not develop}} <b>so</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> the Western Empire. In North Africa the first metropolitan appears {{during the fourth}} century, the Bishop of Carthage being recognized as primate of the dioceses of Northern Africa; metropolitans of the separate provinces gradually appear, although the boundaries of these provinces did not coincide with the divisions of the empire. A similar development was witnessed in Spain, Gaul, and Italy. The migration of the nations, however, prevented an equally stable formation of ecclesiastical provinces in the Christian West as in the East. It was only after the fifth century that such gradually developed, mostly {{in accordance with the}} ancient divisions of the Roman Empire. In Italy alone, on account of the central ecclesiastical position of Rome, this development was slower. However, at the end of Antiquity the existence of church provinces as the basis of ecclesiastical administration was fairly universal in the West. In the Carolingian period they were reorganized, and have retained their place ever since.|$|E
500|$|Boydell's {{willingness}} to {{assume responsibility for}} his own business <b>so</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> his career indicates that he had ambition and an enterprising spirit. Independent shops were risky in the 1740s because no strict copyright laws, other than the Engraving Copyright Act of 1734 (known as [...] "Hogarth's Act"), had yet been instituted. The pirating of published books and prints became a profession {{in its own right}} and greatly decreased the profits of publishers such as Boydell.|$|E
500|$|While UB40 and Brown {{appeared}} in the film as themselves, De Bont also wanted to feature a musician {{as one of the}} characters who gets trapped on the ship. [...] He selected Canadian rhythm and blues (R) singer Tamia because he wanted someone who could sing and act. Tamia did not plan on acting in a film <b>so</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> her career, but said the part was [...] "too perfect for [...] to resist". She worked with de Bont and Quincy Jones to choose a song for the film; they decided on [...] "Make Tonight Beautiful", written by Diane Warren.|$|E
50|$|The soundtrack {{throughout}} {{the film is}} a remarkable achievement, given the primitive equipment available at the time, with a much wider range of editing and mixing techniques than is generally {{thought to have been}} used <b>so</b> <b>early</b> on <b>in</b> talkies.|$|R
50|$|For planetographic longitude, west longitudes (i.e., longitudes {{measured}} {{positively to}} the west) are used when the rotation is prograde, and east longitudes (i.e., longitudes measured positively to the east) when the rotation is retrograde. In simpler terms, imagine a distant, non-orbiting observer viewing a planet as it rotates. Also suppose that this observer {{is within the}} plane of the planet's equator. A point on the Equator that passes directly in front of this observer later in time has a higher planetographic longitude than a point that did <b>so</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> time.|$|R

His involvement has shaped how new idol groups {{interact with their}} music, with The Korea Times acknowledging that his [...] "unprecedented popularity" [...] and recognition [...] " [...] has inspired many young idol-wannabes to become singer-songwriters." [...] Artists that have cited his work as an influence include BTS, Zico, Got7's BamBam, Seventeen's S.Coups, Jaden Smith, Younha, One, Lee Seung-hwan, Kim Eana and Grimes, who states that K-pop, in particular G-Dragon, has influenced her musical style [...] "more visually than anything else." ...|$|E

Räikkönen also had to protect his engine from overheating, caused by a water-leak in the closing stages of the Melbourne race, with Räikkönen stating Ferrari had to [...] "play on the safe side of that engine".

500|$|Injury again sidelined Richard as {{his rookie}} season ended after only 16 games when he {{suffered}} a broken leg. The string of broken bones <b>so</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> his career left observers wondering if Richard was too fragile {{to play at the}} highest levels. He made a second attempt to enlist with the military but was again turned down after x-rays revealed that his bones had not healed properly; Richard's ankle was left permanently deformed, forcing him to alter his skating style. [...] Humiliated by the rejection, he intensified his training and reported to Montreal's training camp for the 1943–44 season fully healthy. The arrival of his daughter, Huguette, prompted Richard to change his uniform to number 9 to match his daughter's birth weight of nine pounds.|$|E
