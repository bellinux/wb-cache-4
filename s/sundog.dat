2500|$|Skeptical {{investigator}} Joe Nickell {{wrote that}} the [...] "dancing sun" [...] effects reported at Fátima were [...] "a combination of factors, including optical effects and meteorological phenomena, such as the sun being seen through thin clouds, causing it to appear as a silver disc. Other possibilities include an alteration in {{the density of the}} passing clouds, causing the sun’s image to alternately brighten and dim and so seem to advance and recede, and dust or moisture droplets in the atmosphere refracting the sunlight and thus imparting a variety of colors". However, Dr. Jose Maria de Almeida Garrett observed, [...] "It could not be confused with the sun seen through a fog (there was no fog at that moment)." [...] Nickell also suggests that unusual visual effects could have resulted from temporary retinal distortion caused by staring at the intense light of the Sun, or have been caused by a <b>sundog,</b> a relatively common atmospheric optical phenomenon. Nickell also highlights the psychological suggestibility of the witnesses, noting that devout spectators often come to locations where Marian apparitions have been reported [...] "fully expecting some miraculous event", such as the 1988 Lubbock apparition of Mary in Texas, the Mother Cabrini Shrine near Denver, Colorado, in 1992, and Conyers, Georgia, in the early to mid-1990s.|$|E

50|$|The {{player can}} try to either talk or {{threaten}} the pirates, {{but sooner or later}} the player will have to resort to combat.The <b>SunDog</b> has shields and two weapons systems (lasers and a cannon), but both have to be controlled manually. Hits from the pirates on the <b>SunDog</b> deplete shields and will damage systems and the hull if the shields get low. A player can destroy a pirate, survive to reach a planet, at which point the <b>SunDog</b> can safely land, or charge up their warp drive and warp (however warping from inside a system may fail). As a last resort the <b>SunDog</b> may jettison its cargo, which will make the pirates lose interest. If the player destroys a pirate, {{they may be able to}} obtain whatever cargo it was carrying. Damage to the SunDog's systems can be repaired on the fly by the player by leaving the cockpit and replacing damaged components, if they can afford the time.|$|E
