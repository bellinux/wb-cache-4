2500|$|In {{an episode}} {{broadcast}} March 28, 1948, Benny borrowed neighbor Ronald Colman's Oscar, and was returning {{home when he}} was accosted by a mugger (voiced by comedian Eddie Marr). After asking for a match to light a cigarette, the mugger demands, [...] "Don't make a move, this is a stickup. Now, come on. Your money or your life." [...] Benny paused, and the studio audience—knowing his skinflint character—laughed. The robber then repeated his demand: [...] "Look, bud! I <b>said</b> <b>your</b> money or your life!" [...] Benny snapped back, without a break, [...] "I'm thinking it over!" [...] This time, the audience laughed louder and longer than they had during the pause.|$|E
2500|$|Silently, Otello enters, with a sword. He {{kisses his}} wife three times; she awakens. Otello asks {{her if she}} has prayed tonight; she must die, {{and he does not}} wish to condemn her soul. She asks God for mercy, both for her and for Otello. Otello accuses her of sin, saying that he must kill her because she loves Cassio. Desdemona denies it and asks that he summon Cassio to testify to her innocence. Otello says that Cassio is already dead. Desdemona, horrified, pleads for mercy, but Otello tells her it's too late and {{strangles}} her (Otello, Desdemona: Diceste questa sera le vostre preci / [...] "Have you <b>said</b> <b>your</b> prayers tonight?").|$|E
2500|$|In late 208, when Sun Quan {{received}} {{news that}} Cao Cao {{was planning to}} lead his forces across the Yangtze River to invade Jiangdong, he held a discussion with his subjects {{on how to deal}} with Cao Cao. Everyone present at the meeting advised Sun Quan to surrender and welcome Cao Cao; only Lu Su remained silent. When Sun Quan left the meeting for a change of clothes, Lu Su hurriedly left his seat and followed his lord. Sun Quan understood Lu Su's intention, so he held Lu Su's hand and asked, [...] "What do you wish to tell me?" [...] Lu Su replied, [...] Sun Quan sighed and said, [...] "I'm very disappointed with what those gentlemen <b>said.</b> <b>Your</b> thoughts are exactly the same as mine. This is a sign that Heaven has granted you to me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Afterward, Jack {{returns to}} the Rabinowitz home. He kneels at his father's bedside and the two {{converse}} fondly: [...] "My son—I love you." [...] Sara suggests that it may help heal his father if Jack takes his place at the Yom Kippur service. Mary arrives with the producer, who warns Jack that he'll never work on Broadway again if he fails to appear on opening night. Jack can't decide. Mary challenges him: [...] "Were you lying when you <b>said</b> <b>your</b> career came before everything?" [...] Jack is unsure if he even can replace his father: [...] "I haven't sung Kol Nidre since I was a little boy." [...] His mother tells him, [...] "Do what is in your heart, Jakie—if you sing and God is not in your voice— your father will know." [...] The producer cajoles Jack: [...] "You're a jazz singer at heart!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, the band's {{style has}} been {{described}} as coming from [...] "the school of Cole Porter, favouring caustic wit over trivial personal problems,... achingly clever lyrics seesaw between superficial gloss, profound sentiment and the incomprehensibly bizarre." [...] Repeated lyrical motifs have become a distinct feature on recent albums. On [...] "My Baby's Taking Me Home" [...] off Lil' Beethoven (2002), the song title is repeated 104 times, with no other words being used, other than a spoken interlude. Similarly, on the same album, [...] "Your Call Is Very Important To Us", uses a corporation style call-hold message: [...] "Your call is very important to us. [...] Please hold" [...] which is then sung with some additional words: [...] "At first she <b>said</b> <b>your</b> call is very important to us, then she said please, please hold." [...] The only other lyrics in the song are [...] "Red light", [...] "Green light", [...] "I'm Getting Mixed Signals" [...] and [...] "Sorry, I'm Going To Have To Put You Back On Hold". These elements are layered with a simple piano line to create a highly textured effect.|$|E
