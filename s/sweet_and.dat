40|$|An {{original}} questionnaire, the Foods and Moods Inventory (FMI) {{was used}} to investigate appetite for <b>sweets</b> <b>and</b> chocolate {{and its relationship to}} dysphoric mood. The FMI was administered to a group of subjects with an identified interest in chocolate (chocolate group, N = 73), a comparison sample (comparison group, N = 172), and a sample of former alcoholics (iV = 22). Those who reported “self-medicating ” with sweets or chocolate {{were more likely to have}} personality traits associated with hysteroid dysphoria, an atypical depressive syndrome.

5|$|Aging / Curing: While {{not always}} {{required}}, some teas required additional aging, secondary fermentation, or baking {{to reach their}} drinking potential. For instance, a green tea puerh, prior to curing into a post-fermented tea, is often bitter and harsh in taste, but becomes <b>sweet</b> <b>and</b> mellow through fermentation by age or dampness. Additionally, oolong can benefit from aging if fired over charcoal. Flavoured teas are manufactured in this stage by spraying the tea with aromas and flavours or by storing them with their flavorants.|$|E

The book offers imaginative and sophisticated recipes, with spicy <b>sweet</b> <b>and</b> sour sauces thickened with bread or quantities of almonds boiled, peeled, dried and ground, and often served in pastry. Foods such as gingerbread are described. It was not at all, emphasises Clarissa Dickson Wright in her A History of English Food, a matter of large lumps of roast meat at every meal as imagined in Hollywood films.|$|E
