50|$|During the First World War, Rüling {{proved to}} be an ardent patriot, {{nationalist}} and imperialist. It does not appear, however, that she ever joined the Nazi Party. She left Düsseldorf, as well as full-time journalism, in the late 1930s, moving to Ulm. There she worked as secretary, director and <b>script-editor</b> at the municipal theatre. A decade later, she relocated to Delmenhorst, continuing the theatre career but also resuming journalism in 1949. At the time of her sudden death on 8 May 1953, the 72-year-old Theo Anna Sprüngli ("Anna Rüling") was one of the oldest female journalists in the Federal Republic of Germany.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the late}} 1950s when staying in London, Beckett often met with Barbara Bray, {{at the time}} a <b>script-editor</b> with the BBC. A small and {{attractive}} widow in her thirties she was also intelligent and well read. “Beckett seems to have been immediately attracted to her and she to him. Their encounter was highly significant for them both, for it represented the beginning of a relationship that was to last, in parallel with that with of long-time partner Suzanne, {{for the rest of his}} life.” In short time their association became “a very intimate and personal one.” ...|$|E

50|$|The Daleks single page comic strip. Sixteen stories / {{one hundred}} and four instalments. 1965 - 1967. Century 21 Publishing / City Magazines Ltd.The strip {{appeared}} in full colour on the rear page of the comic. Although credited to Terry Nation (the creator of the Dalek concept for the BBC Doctor Who programme) his contribution to the writing, if any, is unclear. In an interview for Doctor Who Classic Comics the first editor of TV Century 21, Alan Fennell, stated that he (Fennell) was primarily responsible for the initial two or three stories. David Whitaker (the original script editor for the Doctor Who television programme) then took over, with Fennell retaining plot approval and providing some story input thereafter. As originally published the sixteen stories comprising the strip had no individual titles. Those given in this article have come into common use, being the result of research by Big Finish Productions producer, director, <b>script-editor</b> and voice actor John Ainsworth.|$|E
5000|$|... "Thankfully, {{when the}} {{opportunity}} came for a script to be written, the guys said, well, no one knows these characters better than Bryan - let's give him a try! I {{thought it was just}} an exercise when David came up and asked if I wanted to take a crack for episode four, I said, 'Oh! Well, that's nice, trying to give me something to do.'We were doing post-production on the pilot then and I didn't have quite as much to do around that time, so I thought it was a nice gesture. So I went home and wrote it and turned it in and then they said, 'Well, that's it, that's episode 4.'" [...] — Bryan Cogman in an interview in Westeros.org [...] Cogman worked on the Game of Thrones pilot as a writing assistant and was contracted for the full series as <b>script-editor</b> and the unofficial [...] "keeper of the mythos" [...] for the show, entrusted with the task of writing the series bible outlining character and background information, and making sure that the world-building remained consistent. In this capacity, he was approached by Benioff and Weiss, who asked him to write a treatment for the fourth episode. Believing it was only an exercise that would be completely rewritten by another professional writer, he completed the script that ended up being episode four.|$|E
5000|$|During {{the late}} 1950s, Beckett often stayed in London, {{where he met}} Barbara Bray, a BBC <b>script-editor,</b> a widow in her 30s. James Knowlson writes of them: [...] "Beckett {{seems to have been}} {{immediately}} attracted to her and she to him. Their encounter was highly significant for them both, for it represented the beginning of a relationship that was to last, in parallel with that with Suzanne, {{for the rest of his}} life." [...] Soon, their association became [...] "a very intimate and personal one". In a visit to Paris in January 1961, Bray told Beckett she had decided to move there. His response was unusual. In March 1961, he married Déchevaux-Dumesnil in a civil ceremony in Folkestone. On the face of it, this was to make sure that, if he died before her, Déchevaux-Dumesnil would inherit the rights to his work because there was no common-law marriage under French law. He may also have wanted to affirm his loyalty to her. In June 1961, Bray moved to Paris, and despite his recent marriage, Beckett spent much of his time with her. This side of his life was not well known, as Beckett’s reserve was [...] "allied to his fear of giving offence to Suzanne". Beckett's play Play (1963) seems to be inspired by these events.|$|E
