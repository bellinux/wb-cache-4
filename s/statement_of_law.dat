In England, {{this was not the}} case; the Arbitration Act 1950, in Section 22(1), allowed the courts to instruct an arbitrator to [...] "correct" [...] his decision, if it had an incorrect <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>law</b> immediately obvious. In response to this, English arbitrators simply stopped giving reasons for their decisions. The second form of judicial oversight was found in Section 21, and was an application of the [...] "Case Stated" [...] procedure. This allowed judicial review of a decision by the High Court of Justice, and was regularly applied during the 1970s, because the freeze on interest rates during a delayed case made it attractive for debtors to delay; conversely, this made London a far less attractive venue for creditors.|$|E

50|$|The {{sequence}} of chapters in both books of The Shield of Achilles follows the {{sequence of}} the novel Nostromo by Joseph Conrad—present, past, future. Somewhat more prosaically, this is the order of Statement of Facts, <b>Statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Law,</b> and Holding in an Anglo-American judicial opinion. The first parts of Book I and Book II deal with 20th-century and contemporary events; the second parts of both books then flash back {{to the emergence of}} states in the 16th century and take the historical narrative up {{to the point where the}} first parts had begun; the third part of each book addresses the future, beginning where the first parts left off. This methodical if unorthodox sequencing allows the historian to avoid the tempting mechanics of foreshadowing, emphasizing the possibilities of different outcomes at each stage, and deepening the understanding of how the past can liberate the present.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{once the}} {{decision-maker}} has {{taken into account}} the relevant considerations, the courts are reluctant to scrutinize {{the manner in which}} the decision-maker balances the considerations. This can be gleaned from the case of R. v.

The Court emphasized that the weighing of those relevant considerations was a matter for the Commission, not the courts.

50|$|In Attorney-General’s Reference (No 2 of 1999), a case on {{corporate}} manslaughter that arose {{out of the}} Southall rail crash, the Court of Appeal decided the defendant's subjective state of mind (i.e. whether there was conscious risk-taking) is irrelevant and, therefore, so {{is the question of}} recklessness, leaving the objective test as the only test for liability. Rose LJ, said:Although there may be cases where the defendant’s state of mind is relevant to the jury’s consideration when assessing the grossness and criminality of his conduct, evidence of his state of mind is not a pre-requisite to a conviction for manslaughter by gross negligence. The Adomako test is objective, but a defendant who is reckless as defined in Stone may well be the more readily found to be grossly negligent to a criminal degree.In our judgment unless an identified individual’s conduct, characterisable as gross criminal negligence, {{can be attributed to the}} company, the company is not, in the present state of the common law, liable for manslaughter.Civil negligence rules are not apt to confer criminal liability…the identification principle remains the only basis in common law for corporate liability for gross negligence manslaughter. (see imputation). This was only persuasive authority for the law of manslaughter at large, but R v DPP, ex p Jones which said that the test of negligent manslaughter is objective, confirmed Attorney General’s Reference (No 2 of 1999) as a correct general <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
