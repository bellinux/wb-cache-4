50|$|June 2002 saw the {{coffer dam}} removed {{from around the}} {{rotating}} <b>sector</b> <b>gate,</b> and also saw the first vessel on the waterway, when a British Waterways maintenance boat passed from the Lancaster Canal into the connection basin above the staircase locks. A number of boats traversed the navigation in July 2002, in order {{to assist with the}} commissioning of the locks and the methods of working. The boats were all owned by members of the Ribble Link Trust, who made their way from Preston Docks to the Lancaster Canal. Problems with the hydraulic swing bridge at the exit from the docks resulted in the boats leaving two hours later than expected, but a very high tide ensured that all the boats managed to pass through the <b>sector</b> <b>gate</b> before water levels dropped. The official opening took place on 20 September 2002, when the Rt. Hon.

40|$|Abstract Objective: {{to analyze}} the {{relationship}} between psychosocial stress dimensions and salivary cortisol in military police officers. Method: cross-sectional and analytical study with 134 military police officers. The Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) Model scale {{has been used to}} assess psychosocial stress. Salivary cortisol was collected in three samples. The following tests were used: Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney, ANOVA, Bonferroni, Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn. Pearson and Spearman correlation methods were used, as well as multiple linear regression. Cortisol at night showed an ascending statistical association with the psychosocial reward (p= 0. 004) and a descending association with the effort-impairment scores (p= 0. 017). Being part of the Special Tactical Operations Group (GATE) and the diastolic blood pressure explained 13. 5 % of the variation in cortisol levels on waking up. The <b>sectors</b> <b>GATE,</b> Special Patrol of the Elite Squad of the Military Police and Motorcyclists explained 21. 9 % of the variation in cortisol levels 30 -minute after awakening.

40|$|The {{spillway}} of Sarpfossen {{hydropower plant}} {{has been studied}} numerically and experimentally. The physical model {{was built in the}} Vassdragslaboratoriet at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, NTNU. The model consists of the Sarpfossen dam and the river Glomma upstream of the dam. On the spillway crest are three gates installed - two flap gates and a <b>sector</b> <b>gate.</b> In addtion is further upstream of the dam a bridge for cars and trains. Two of the bridge piers are fixed in the water and has an influence in the flow pattern. The model was run with a certain discharge and the velocities in the river were measured with a Flow Meter and VectrinoVelocimeter. Besides of the velocity measurements the water levels between bridge and dam were measured. These measurements were conducted to investigate the occuring wave phenomena, shock wave. The simulations were carried out by a commercial program, STAR-CCM+. The results from the simulation have been verified by the measurements from the model. Simulation were performed to replicate the flow phenomenas in the physical model and to find out how well STAR-CCM+ is suited to cope the complex flow structures. Three simulations were performed - two for the velocity distribution and one for the water level measurements with generated shock waves. The results of the simulations show quite good correlations. The velocity measurements show satisfying results. The shock wave could also be replicated quite well and the results are quite promising. Future studies are recommended to get more experience with simulating complex free-surface flows. Especially simulations of shock wave are not very frequent and well tested and should be included in further studies. </p...|$|E

40|$|Keine Zusammenfassung in deutscher Sprache vorhanden.) The highly dynamic {{morphology}} of the Eider estuary at the German North Sea Coast {{is strongly}} {{affected by a}} storm surge barrier at the river mouth. The operation of the five <b>sector</b> <b>gates</b> influences the estuary hydrodynamics, sediment dynamics and morphology in different scales reaching from small-scale scour evolution behind the gates, to medium scale meandering of the main river channel, to large-scale sedimentation trends of the whole estuary. In order to investigate the morphodynamic processes a 2 DH process based model has been set up, covering the whole tidally influenced estuary area from the weir to a dam 36 km upstream. Hydrodynamics, sediment transports and bottom evolution have been calculated in successive modules coupled to a morphodynamic modeling system. A thorough calibration and validation of the single computational modules was carried out for short-term events, so that the model is capable to simulate short-term morphodynamic events in reasonable quality. The application of process based numerical models to medium to large scale (years to decades) events requires reduction and simplification techniques as input- and process filtering. Common techniques (e. g. representative boundary conditions) are described and discussed. A modified approach for defining a representative tide is presented. Its application to medium scale morphodynamic simulations for periods {{up to two years}} shows promising results. Results of large scale simulations are presented and discussed...|$|R
