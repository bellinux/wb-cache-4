5|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by Jonas Åkerlund and released on the album on December 13, 2013. It features the singer leading a protesting group in which numerous celebrities make cameo appearances, most notably the singer's former Destiny's Child group bandmates Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. The video does not feature lip <b>syncing</b> like the singer's other works and it is shot in slow motion. The song was not performed by Beyoncé but {{was used as a}} snippet in interludes during various performances.|$|E
5|$|While {{the cast}} {{departed}} {{to work on}} other projects, the post-production team was tasked with finalizing the film {{in time for a}} Christmas release; the resulting work would take twice as long as the filming process had taken. Editor Todd Ramsay and assistants spent principal photography <b>syncing</b> film and audio tracks. The resulting rough cuts were used to formulate plans for sound effects, music, and optical effects that would be added later.|$|E
5|$|HDMI 1.3 was {{released}} on June 22, 2006, and increased the maximum TMDS clock to 340MHz (10.2Gbit/s). Like previous versions, it uses 8b/10b encoding, giving it a maximum video bandwidth of 8.16Gbit/s (1920×1080 at 120Hz or 2560×1440 at 60Hz). It added support for 10bpc, 12bpc, and 16bpc color depth (30, 36, and 48bit/px), called deep color. It also added support for the xvYCC color space, {{in addition to the}} Rec. 601 and Rec. 709 color spaces supported by previous versions, and added the ability to carry metadata defining color gamut boundaries. It also optionally allows output of Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio streams for external decoding by AV receivers. It incorporates automatic audio <b>syncing</b> (audio video sync) capability. It defined cable Categories 1 and 2, with Category 1 cable being tested up to 74.25 MHz and Category 2 being tested up to 340 MHz. It also added the new type C Mini connector for portable devices.|$|E

5|$|Other {{characters}} {{include the}} {{various members of}} the Kingsglaive and Regis' council: Banjō Ginga (JP) /John DeMita (EN) as Clarus Amicitia, father to main character Gladiolus; Wataru Takagi (JP) /Ben Diskin (EN) as Pelna Khara; and Fuminori Komatsu (JP) /Max Mittelman (EN) as Tredd Furia. Unvoiced characters include Kingsglaive members Sonitus Bellum and Axis Arra. While both English and Japanese voicetracks were produced, lip <b>syncing</b> for all versions was matched to the English voice work. The lead voice actors, such as Paul, were chosen so they would be recognized and appeal to a wide audience, in addition to their acting abilities. The Japanese voice casting followed a similar model, choosing well-known actors for the lead roles. Casting was handled by Rui Kawada, who also acted as general project manager. The compartmentalization of the development meant that the characters were mostly voiced by different actors to Final Fantasy XV. Originally there were plans for both the movie and game voice cast to cross over, but these were scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Unique to Black and White is the Pokémon Dream World, {{which is}} {{dependent}} on the official Pokémon Global Link website. Here, the player can befriend Pokémon that are not normally obtainable in-game and that have unique abilities. This occurs after <b>syncing</b> the game back with the Dream World, similarly to the Pokéwalker from HeartGold and SoulSilver. The player can maintain a house in the Dream World that other players can visit as well as grow berries. In addition to allowing access to Pokémon acquired in the Dream World, the Entralink also enables players to interact with each other and play side-games. These side-games award points that can be traded for temporary powers such as increasing experience, improving capture rate, or lowering prices of items in Poké Marts.|$|E
5|$|The {{walkie-talkie}} {{interaction in}} Firewatch {{is inspired by}} the relationship in BioShock between the player character and Atlas, {{as well as the}} dialog system from The Walking Dead. At one point in the development, it was intended that the protagonist would be able to communicate with multiple characters, such as hikers, but the idea was discarded due to its expense and the schedule requirements with which the team were working. The team hoped to avoid lip <b>syncing</b> and minimize the amount of animation needed due to the limited team size and resources. The developers cast Cissy Jones, who appeared in The Walking Dead, as the voice of Delilah in 2014. It took longer to find a voice actor for Henry who the developers felt jibed with Jones; they ultimately cast Rich Sommer. Jones and Sommer recorded their lines in separate studios, but while on conference calls with each other to achieve a more natural rapport. The actors made a decision not to meet during production to maintain the distance between their characters.|$|E

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} need of synchronization and clock frequency distribution in core and access networks. Synchronous Ethernet (<b>SyncE)</b> is a technology that is able to distribute clock frequency over Ethernet networks, while keeping scalability and reduced costs. Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is another emerging technology that is changing the landscape of network management by separating the control and data planes and introducing a centralized management architecture, {{with the goal of}} optimizing network operations. OpenFlow is currently the most popular southbound interface between the control and data planes in SDN networks. In order to operate <b>SyncE</b> networks under the new SDN paradigm and exploit its advantages, an extension of OpenFlow messages and operations is needed. This paper discusses how SDN and <b>SyncE</b> can interoperate, proposes a set of OpenFlow extensions that are backwards compatible with <b>SyncE</b> equipment, and presents results from a an implementation.
