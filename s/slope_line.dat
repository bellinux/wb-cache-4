40|$|An {{analytical}} {{basis for}} the determination of <b>slope</b> <b>lines</b> in grid digital elevation models is provided by using the D 8 -LTD method (eight slope directions, least transverse deviation). The D 8 -LTD method's capability to predict consistently exact <b>slope</b> <b>lines</b> as the grid cell size goes to zero is shown analytically by applying mathematical analysis methods. The use of cumulative, least transverse deviations {{is found to be}} the key factor allowing for globally unbiased approximations of <b>slope</b> <b>lines.</b> The D 8 -LTD method's properties are also demonstrated numerically by using digital elevation models of a synthetic sloping surface obtained from the Himmelblau function. It is shown that <b>slope</b> <b>lines</b> obtained from the D 8 -LTD method can approximate the exact <b>slope</b> <b>lines</b> as close as desired by selecting a grid cell size that is small enough. In contrast, the standard D 8 method is found to produce significantly biased results even when small grid cells are used. The D 8 -LTD method outperforms the D 8 method over a wide range of grid cell sizes (up to 20 m in this application), beyond which grid cell size becomes too large to validly represent the underlying sloping surface. It is therefore concluded that the D 8 -LTD method should be used in preference to the standard D 8 method in order to obtain <b>slope</b> <b>lines</b> that are only limited in reliability by the detail of topographic data, and not by the accuracy of the slope direction method applied.
