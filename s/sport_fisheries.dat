5|$|Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River {{are both}} open for fishing. The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission (NCWRC) has {{established}} fishing regulations, such as catch and length limits, that {{are meant to}} enhance <b>sport</b> <b>fisheries</b> in public waters such as Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River. The NCWRC has had regulations in place at Pettigrew State Park since 2002. The regulations specify that anglers may keep largemouth bass that are greater than 20inches (50.8cm) or between 14 and 16inches (35.6-40.6cm). This rule {{was put in place}} {{to increase the number of}} tropy fish, fish over 20inches (50.8cm). Additionally the NCWRC stocks Lake Phelps with bluegill and they have begun a program to reintroduce alewife and blueback herring via fish ladder on Bee Tree Canal from the Scuppernong River.|$|E
5|$|Wild-caught and hatchery-reared {{forms of}} this species have been transplanted and {{introduced}} for food or sport in at least 45 countries and every continent except Antarctica. Introductions to locations outside their native range in the United States (U.S.), Southern Europe, Australia, New Zealand and South America have damaged native fish species. Introduced populations may affect native species by preying on them, out-competing them, transmitting contagious diseases (such as whirling disease), or hybridizing with closely related species and subspecies, thus reducing genetic purity. The rainbow trout {{is included in the}} list of the top 100 globally invasive species. Nonetheless, other introductions into waters previously devoid of any fish species or with severely depleted stocks of native fish have created <b>sport</b> <b>fisheries</b> such as the Great Lakes and Wyoming's Firehole River.|$|E

40|$|Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, {{along with}} other salmonines, were {{introduced}} in Lake Michigan dur-ing the 1960 s to provide a viable <b>sport</b> <b>fishery</b> and biocon-trol for nuisance Alewife Alosa pseudoharengus populations (Tody and Tanner 1966).

50|$|The waters around Sidney once {{supported}} a large <b>sports</b> <b>fishery,</b> {{based largely on}} Chinook salmon, along with ground fish such as ling cod, and various rockfish (Sebastes), but overfishing and poor management have greatly reduced the <b>sports</b> <b>fishery.</b> Also, ecological change {{and the decline of}} critical forage species such as the Pacific herring and the sand lance have had significant impacts on the larger predators, including salmon, killer whales and seabirds. Many of the common fish species and other marine fauna can be seen at the Shaw Ocean Discovery Centre on the Sidney waterfront.|$|R
25|$|Gillnets are {{sometimes}} a controversial gear type especially among sport fishers who argue they are inappropriate especially for salmon fisheries. These arguments are often related to allocation issues between commercial and recreational (<b>sport)</b> <b>fisheries</b> and not conservation issues.

40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} utility of a <b>sport</b> <b>fishery</b> for yellowfin tuna, Thunnus albacares, in the Pemba Channel, Kenya, in {{providing}} ecological information relevant to commercial fishery assessment and management. Age, growth, reproductive status and diet are measured, together with an innovative assessment of the Indian Ocean yellowfin tuna stock. Catch/effort and weight data from {{the records of the}} <b>sport</b> <b>fishery</b> from 1963 - 1995 demonstrate a decline in tuna mean weight since the advent of purse seining in 1984. A periodicity of 5 - 6 years was detected in the Indian ocean longline fishery catches, and in the <b>sport</b> <b>fishery</b> catch/effort and mean weights. Samples were taken from tuna caught in the <b>sport</b> <b>fishery</b> from 1981 - 88. Sport-fished samples were more random in size, age and sex (ratio = 1 : 1) than catches from any of the three major commercial fisheries. The total mortality rate of cohorts deconvoluted from weight-frequencies in the <b>sport</b> <b>fishery</b> catch over 6 years was used in a Caddy & Csirke analysis. Maximum Sustainable Yield estimates of the Indian Ocean stock were 113, 000 tonnes (new method), 110 - 160, 000 tonnes (Walters' method); compared with only 40 - 52, 000 tonnes using the standard equilibrium method. Tuna (1653 over 7 years) were successfully aged using length frequency analysis and by a novel method based on clusters from a Principal Components Analysis of morphometric measures. Juvenile growth was fast, 3. 1 cm/month, whereas adults grew at about 2 cm/month. Gonads (> 1500) were staged for 5 years and histologically examined for 2 years. Female yellowfin mature earlier than males, but males become ripe earlier in the season. The spawning stock consists of females > 120 cm FL. Diet was scored over 4 years and evaluated volumetrically over 2 years. Juvenile tuna eat fish, but adults opportunistically consume fish, cephalopods and crabs, depending on availability. Catchability by gear in both the <b>sport</b> and commercial <b>fisheries</b> is likely influenced by the currently abundant food...|$|R

500|$|Long-toed {{salamander}} {{populations are}} threatened by fragmentation, introduced species, and UV radiation. Forestry, roads, and other land developments have altered the environments that amphibians migrate to, and have increased mortality. Places such as Waterton Lakes National Park have installed a road tunnel underpass to allow safe passage and to sustain the migration ecology of the species. The distribution of the long-toed salamander overlaps extensively with the forestry industry, a dominant resource supporting the economy of British Columbia and the western United States. Long-toed salamanders will alter [...] behaviour and are affected negatively by forestry practices not offering sizable management buffers and protections for the smaller wetlands where salamanders breed. Populations near the Peace River Valley, Alberta, have been lost to the clearing and draining of wetlands for agriculture. Trout introduced for the <b>sport</b> <b>fisheries</b> into once fishless lakes are also destroying long-toed salamander populations. Introduced goldfish prey on the eggs and larvae of long-toed salamanders. Increased exposure to UVB radiation is another factor being implicated in the global decline of amphibians and the long-toed salamander is also susceptible to this threat, which increases the incidence of deformities and reduces their survival and growth rates.|$|E

25|$|The Smith River is an {{excellent}} <b>sport</b> <b>fishery.</b> <b>Sport</b> fish include brown trout, rainbow trout, and whitefish.

25|$|Another major area {{of concern}} for the DFG was water flow. By mid-July each year, snowpack in the {{mountains}} (the major source of water for the Smith River) had completely melted away. Combined with irrigation in the upper Smith River, this meant that water levels on the Smith were too low by mid-summer to support recreational boating or floating. Low water levels also hurt the <b>sport</b> <b>fishery,</b> but although DFG attempted to secure additional water rights these efforts largely failed over the next 20 years. In 1974, DFG abandoned its attempt to manage the Smith River as a <b>sport</b> <b>fishery,</b> and instead began implementing a wild trout fishery management plan. This meant stocking only native fish, as needed, and no more stocking of nonnative sport fish.|$|R
