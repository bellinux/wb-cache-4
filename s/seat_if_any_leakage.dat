40|$|Abstract: Problem statement: There are {{two types}} of global warming {{contributions}} through refrigeration and air conditioning systems. The first one is the Direct Global Warming Potential (DGWP) due to the emission of refrigerants and their interaction with heat radiation. The second one is the Indirect Global Warming Potential (IDGWP) due to the emission of Carbon Dioxide (CO 2) by consuming the energy that is generated through the combustion of fossil fuels. Most of refrigerants used in vapor Compression system were Chlorofluorocarbon (CFCs) and Hydro Chlorofluorocarbon (HCFCs) which contains chlorine and <b>if</b> <b>any</b> <b>leakage</b> in the system, these gases will go up and reach stratosphere. The chlorine atoms in the gases will act as a catalyst to destroy ozone layer and cause ozone depletion which causes health hazards, global warming, melting of polar ice caps and drought. Hence, it is necessary to minimize the Global warming and Ozone depletion. The refrigerant R 22 widely used in the air-conditioners is a major Contributor of Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) which cause irreparable loss to the ozone layer and has to be replaced. Approach: To conserve the energy and minimize the global warming, the systems should be designed as more energy efficient and also to minimize Ozone depletion, the eco friendly refrigerants are to be selected and tested as alternative refrigerants to R 22.

5000|$|After {{a nearly}} two-year legal battle, the Tampa Sports Authority {{came to a}} {{settlement}} with popular sports-seating and telescopic platform/bleacher company Hussey Seating of North Berwick, Maine. Following the stadium's opening in 1998, roughly 50,000 Hussey-manufactured seats at Raymond James Stadium began to fade from their original color - a bright, vibrant shade of red - to a shade of washed-out pink. Spotting this obvious defect, the Buccaneers organization pleaded to the TSA to sue the seating manufacturing company for the cost to replace the affected chairs in 2003. Initially, in May 2004, after testing samples of the seats, Hussey Seating {{did not find any}} cause for the fading, and thus, found no reason to replace the seats at the company's cost under the current 10-year warranty. After the TSA cited a portion of the warranty which did, in fact, state that Hussey would replace <b>seats</b> <b>if</b> <b>any</b> fading were to occur, Hussey president Tim Hussey admitted an error in the research and eventually would come to a $1.5 million agreement with the TSA to replace the problem seats. Reportedly, the seat-fading occurred due to a manufacturing error by Hussey, as a UV inhibitor - a sunscreen-like component for the plastic - was forgotten in the mixture used to create the seats. All of the problem seats were replaced by new, non-pink seats in the spring of 2006.|$|R

Methods: A total of 40 patients scheduled for elective inpatient knee arthroscopy and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) were prospectively enrolled. A 7 to 8 ml stab wound for arthrotomy was performed at the inferolateral site of the knee for cases who would receive arthroscopy and at the inferomedial site for the TKA cases. Then, 50 ml of normal saline was injected into the knee joint while observing fluid leakage from the arthrotomy site. It was considered a positive saline load test <b>if</b> there was <b>any</b> <b>leakage.</b> <b>If</b> not, subsequent direct compression was applied to the knee. <b>Any</b> <b>leakage</b> incurred was considered a positive compression test. Results: The saline load test was positive in 13 out of 40 patients and additional 18 patients showed a positive compression test.

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} early {{surgical}} outcomes ofquick-chop phacoemulsification technique {{in patients with}} high myopia. METHODS: The data of patients with high myopia who underwent quick-chop phacoemulsification were reviewed retrospectively. There were 42 eyes of 31 patients. The axial length was more than 26 mm in all eyes. All eyes underwent quick-chop phacoemulsification surgery with the placement of an intraocular lens (IOL) in the capsular bag. Postoperative visits were performed at 1, 3 d; 2 wk, 1 mo. Early postoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), preoperative and postoperative corneal endothelial cell density (ECD), central corneal thickness (CCT) and postoperative complications were assessed. Paired sample t -test or Wilcoxon tests were used to compare data between preoperative and postoperative data. RESULTS: There was {{no statistically significant difference}} between preoperative and postoperative ECD and CCT. Retinal detachment was developed in one eye at postoperative first day. There was an iris prolapsus from side port insicion. CONCLUSION: Quick-chop phacoemulsification technique is a safe surgical technique.

The {{hydrostatic}} test is performed {{on a computer}} model of a heat exchanger to see <b>if</b> there is <b>any</b> <b>leakage</b> in the heat exchanger. This test is performed on different parts separately based on the calculations specified {{in the book of}} ASME SEC VIII DIV- 1 2007 ED. Maximum allowable pressure (MAWP) for different parts is determined and then is multiplied by a factor of 1. 3. The test is then performed on different parts based on those values continuously for 30 minutes. This test easily tells where the leakage is which usually occurs in the joints which are welded. This test is performed along with FEA before installing the heat exchanger. Once the CAD model is developed, FEA is done to analyze the design thus saving money and time by reducing number of prototypes. Through FEA we can optimize the size so as to reduce the weight of heat exchanger. Through FEA {{we take a look at}} the entire design and understands how load is transferred between parts and also where critical areas of design are located. Thus we can test a design before actually building it, therefore saving the time and cost. Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
50|$|The overall {{theory is}} that {{radioactive}} rock has always been present in the earth, and it is generally harmless to human populations. Further, Cigar Lake and Oklo have proven that actinides do not easily migrate via ground water or other means. Spent fuel consists of radioactive ceramic, cooled until its short-half-life radioactives have decayed, so its heat-production is negligible. When initially made, the ceramic fuel is also wrapped in sealed tubes of corrosion-resistant zirconium alloy. Therefore, spent fuel is not water-soluble in any conventional sense, and is mechanically sturdy. The other elements: crystalline bedrock, corrosion-resistant copper cylinders, etc. have been scientifically proven to reduce the exposure to ground water, and {{the rate at which}} it can penetrate to the fuel and dissolve it. Further, <b>if</b> correctly sited, <b>any</b> <b>leakage</b> will enter seawater, providing a safe dilution to decay. Geological stability against earthquakes and other extreme events can be further reduced by careful site-selection. These safety factors multiply, extending the containment lifetime until most radioactive elements in the fuel have decayed, and only the longest-lived, least-radioactive isotopes remain. At this point, the contents of the repository are at least as safe as natural deposits of uranium. The process has been extensively studied and depends on well-understood chemistry and geology.|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIThe {{interplay between}} {{congestion}} and crowding externalities {{in the design}} of urban bus systems is identified and analysed. A multimodal social welfare maximisation model with spatially disaggregated demand is developed, in which users choose between travelling by bus, car or walking in a transport corridor. Optimisation variables are bus fare, congestion toll, bus frequency, bus size, fare collection system, bus boarding policy and the number of seats inside buses. We find that optimal bus frequency results from a trade-off between the level of congestion inside buses, i. e., passengers’ crowding, and the level of congestion outside buses, i. e., the effect of frequency on slowing down both buses and cars in mixed-traffic roads. A numerical application shows that optimal frequency is quite sensitive to the assumptions on crowding costs, impact of buses on traffic congestion, and overall congestion level. If crowding matters to users, buses should have as many seats as possible, up to a minimum area that must be left free of <b>seats.</b> <b>If</b> for <b>any</b> other reason planners decide to have buses with fewer seats than optimal (e. g., to increase bus capacity), frequency should be increased to compensate for the discomfort imposed on public transport users.

50|$|Containers, vessels, enclosures, {{or other}} fluid system are {{sometimes}} tested for leaks - to see <b>if</b> there is <b>any</b> <b>leakage</b> {{and to find}} where the leaks are so corrective action can be taken. There are several methods for leak testing, depending on the situation. Sometimes leakage of fluid may make a sound which can be detected. Tires, engine radiators, and maybe some other smaller vessels may be tested by pressurizing them with air and submerging them in water to see where air bubbles come out to indicate a leak. If submerging in water is not possible, then pressurization with air followed by covering the area to be tested with a soap solution is done to see if soap bubbles form, which indicate a leak. Other types of testing for gas leaks may involve testing for the outleaking gases with sensors which can detect that gas, for example - special sensing instruments for detecting natural gas. U.S. federal safety law now requires natural gas companies to conduct testing for gas leaks upstream of their customer's gas meters. Where liquids are used, special color dyes may be added to help see the leakage. Other detectable substances {{in one of the}} liquids may be tested, such as saline to find a leak in a sea water system, or detectable substances may even be deliberately added to test for leakage.|$|R
