40|$|Application of {{electrical}} resistivity tomography (ERT) in geomorphology. Geophysical sounding {{is getting to}} be very important tool for geomorphological reaearch. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is (beside ground penetrating radar and seismic refraction) one of the most suitable technique for investigation of the depth and internal structure of various quaternary deposits, weathering mantles, landslides and other geomorphic topics. Method is based on applying a constant current into the ground through two „current electrodes“ and measuring the resulting voltage differences at two „potential electrodes“. Our measurements (33 case studies) are established on the <b>Schlumberger</b> <b>electrode</b> <b>array</b> which was chosen during resistivity measurement and resulting apparent resistivity pseudosection was transformed into a model representing continuous distribution of calculated electrical resistivity in the subsurface by RES 2 Dinv software.

Geoelectric parameters (layer resistivity and thickness) were determined from the interpreted data. The study area comprises four geoelectric layers (topsoil, lateritic layer, weathered/fractured layer and fresh basement). The geoelectric parameters of the overlying layers across the area were used to assess the vulnerability of the underlying aquifers to near-surface contaminants with the aid of vulnerability maps generated. Three models were compared by maps using geo-electrically derived models; longitudinal conductance, GOD (groundwater occurrence, overlying lithology and depth to the aquifer) and GLSI (geoelectric layer susceptibility indexing). The total longitudinal conductance map shows the north central part of the study area as a weakly protected (0. 1 â 0. 19) area, while the northern and southern parts have poor protective capacity (< 0. 1); this is in agreement with the GOD method which shows {{the northern part of the}} study area as less vulnerable (0 â 0. 1) while the southern part has low/moderate (0. 1 â 0. 3) vulnerability to contamination. The longitudinal conductance exaggerates the degree of susceptibility to contamination than the GOD and GLSI models. From the models, vulnerability to contamination can be considered higher at the southern part than the northern part and therefore, sources of contamination like septic tank, refuse dump should be cited far from groundwater development area.

It is therefore {{important that the}} <b>electrode</b> <b>array</b> does not cause damage to the fine intracochlear structures {{during the process of}} insertion, as this can result in the loss of spiral ganglion cells, which are necessary for the implant to evoke auditory percepts. There is strong evidence that trauma and damage during insertion of <b>electrode</b> <b>arrays</b> into the human cochlea are related to the stiffness of the <b>electrode</b> <b>array.</b> Previous studies were conducted to experimentally determine the stiffness properties of <b>electrode</b> <b>arrays</b> using three-point flexural bending and buckling tests. In this paper, the design of Nucleus straight <b>electrode</b> <b>array</b> is modified to give a greater flexibility to further reduce the risk of trauma to delicate structures of the cochlea during surgical insertion of the <b>electrode</b> <b>array.</b> This is achieved by reducing the cross-sectional area of the <b>electrode</b> <b>array</b> at selected positions over its length.

The Igando landfill is defined by resistivity varying between 2. 5 Ω-m at decomposed stage and 26. 1 Ω-m at fresh dump. Olushosun landfill is defined by resistivity varying between 2. 4 Ω-m at decomposed stage and 51. 5 Ω-m at fresh dump. Interpretation of sounding curves showed that Abule Egba is underlain by fairly thick column of clayey sand indicating an unconfined aquifer. Igando landfill is underlain by thick clay column indicating a confined aquifer. The northern flank of Olushosun landfill is overlain by thin refuse dump (4. 4 m) while thick refuse dump (22. 9 m) overlies the central area. The hydrogeologic system at Abule Egba is vulnerable to contamination.

Background: Advantages to be expected of a perimodiolar <b>electrode</b> <b>array</b> include both a reduction in stimulus thresholds and an increase in dynamic range, resulting in a more localized stimulation pattern of the spiral ganglion cells, reduced power consumption, and, therefore, longer speech processor battery life. Methods: The test arrays were implanted into human temporal bones. Image analysis was performed on a radiograph taken after the insertion. The cochleas were then histologically processed with the <b>electrode</b> <b>array</b> in situ, and the resulting sections were subsequently assessed for position of the <b>electrode</b> <b>array</b> as well as insertion-related intracochlear damage.

Young’s modulus of elasticity of the Nucleus straight array has been found to increase from the tip (182 MPa) to the rear end (491 MPa), whereas the stiffness of the contour array is greatest near the tip (480 MPa) and is fairly uniform in the middle and rear sections of the <b>electrode</b> <b>array</b> (380 - 400 MPa). Buckling experiments have shown that the contour array has much higher critical buckling load (about four times) than the Nucleus straight array. The results from three-point flexural bending and buckling experiments provide significant data for the development of <b>electrode</b> <b>arrays,</b> from which new array designs with improved flexibility can be developed. The results of stiffness properties are also important input for use in finite element models to predict the trajectories during insertion and to help evaluate the effects of different <b>electrode</b> <b>array</b> designs on damage sustained during insertion.

This paper develops a framework to enable design of model-based <b>electrode</b> <b>array</b> feedback controllers that balances joint angle tracking performance with {{the degree of}} disturbance and modeling mismatch that can exist in the true underlying biomechanical system. This framework is used to develop a simplified control design procedure that is suitable for application in a clinical setting.

This version is reproduced {{with the permission of}} publisher. Multiple-channel auditory prostheses provide both temporal and formant information to profoundly-totally deaf patients. This is achieved via direct electrical stimulation of selective regions of the residual auditory nerve using an <b>electrode</b> <b>array</b> located in the scala tympani. Histological evidence has shown that these <b>electrode</b> <b>arrays</b> lie along the outer wall of the scala tympani, some distance from the residual nerve elements. In the present study we systematically varied the position of the <b>electrode</b> <b>array</b> within the cat scala tympani in order to investigate the influence of electrode position on neural excitation. Such knowledge may {{contribute to the development of}} improved <b>electrode</b> <b>arrays</b> for auditory prostheses. 17 - 20 AprilOpen Acces...|$|R
5000|$|For {{individuals}} with {{sensorineural hearing loss}} surgical implantation of a cochlear implant is indicated. The success of a cochlear implant relies in part upon <b>electrode</b> <b>array</b> placement within the cochlea in which the positioning {{is based on the}} frequency-spatial relationship empirically described by the Greenwood function. By aligning the electrodes with the positions of the auditory ganglia contacting the basilar membrane as described by the Greenwood function, the cochlear implant <b>electrode</b> <b>array</b> stimulates auditory ganglia associated with the reception of frequencies associated with speech recognition. <b>Electrode</b> <b>array</b> insertion depth is guided by the frequency map created by the Greenwood function, and allows electrical stimulation of neurons involved in stimulating the area of the brain responsible for speech recognition while minimizing ganglia stimulation in noise-generating regions. Well-placed <b>electrode</b> <b>arrays</b> in patients receiving cochlear implants can allow otherwise deafened auditory systems to achieve hearing and recognize speech.
