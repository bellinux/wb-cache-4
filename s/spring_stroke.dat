40|$|There {{seems to}} be a strong {{assumption}} among people who have suffered a stroke and who have become paralyzed on one side that it would no longer be possible to enjoy the leisure activity of playing golf. Such an assumption was found to prevail in a personal survey of twenty-five members of the Palms <b>Springs</b> <b>Stroke</b> Resocialization Club in California. Of the twenty-five people questioned, thirteen said that they had played golf prior to their stroke, but they did not know how {{it would be possible to}} resume the activity again. No materials have been found by this writer which addresses the ???how??? of playing gold after a person has become a hemiplegic because of having had a stroke. This writer, prior to sustaining a stroke which left him a hemiplegic, was a professional golf teacher for four years. With the belief that a person need not be totally incapacitated because of having sustained a stroke, he began to investigate how best to adapt to the new procedures that needed to be implemented to play the game of golf. Based upon his empirical knowledge of how to play the game with the new restrictions, he prepared a manual which will show those who had previously enjoyed golf how they might resume the game on a one ???hand basis. The manual explains relevant matters such as equipment that is necessary, gripping the club, addressing the ball, swinging the club, and the approach???sand and hazard shots. The manual describes putting and general procedures to follow in various regulation games. Also addressed is the matter of understanding one???s capabilities and how to exercise properly. Photographs are included in the manual which are simple and descriptive; they illustrate the written guidelines in a forthright manner. The recommendation is given in this project that further evaluative studies be made in the future when this book has been distributed to people who have had stroke and have begun to attempt to follow its guidelines...|$|R

50|$|The Sanskrit name of {{this river}} is Vitasta. The river's name {{is derived from the}} mythological {{incident}} regarding the origin of the river as explained in Nilamata Purana. Goddess Parvati was requested by sage Kasyapa to come to Kashmir for purification of the land from evil practices and impurities of Pisachas living there. Goddess Parvati then assumed the form of a river in the Nether World. Then Lord Shiva made a stroke with his spear near the abode of Nila (Verinag <b>Spring).</b> By that <b>stroke</b> of the spear, Goddess Parvati came out of the Nether World. Shiva himself named her as Vitasta. He had excavated with the spear a ditch measuring one Vitasti (a particular measure of length defined either as a long span between the extended thumb and little finger, or as the distance between the wrist and the tip of the fingers, and said to be about 9 inches), through which the river - gone to the Nether World - had come out, so she was given the name Vitasta by him.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2000 The {{present study}} {{examined}} the importance of four psychological constructs, self-efficacy, cognitive interference, sport anxiety, and psychological coping skills, in predicting the performance of 117 men and 79 women intercollegiate golfers in the Pacific- 10 Athletic Conference. Prior {{to the start of}} the 1997 spring intercollegiate golf season, members of all men's and women's teams in the conference completed a questionnaire which included trait measures of self-efficacy, sport anxiety, athletic coping skills, and social desirability. The coaches at each of these schools rated each of their players' psychological and physical abilities as well using separate rating instruments. At the men's and women's Pac- 10 Conference Championships, additional state measures of self-efficacy and cognitive interference were gathered. Outcome measures included the participant's <b>spring</b> tournament <b>stroke</b> average and number of competitive rounds completed. In addition, total score, total birdies (one under par on a hole) or better, and total double-bogeys (two over par on a hole) or worse were calculated for the 60 men and 50 women who participated in the Pac- 10 Tournament. Results revealed that each of main psychological factors was significantly correlated with golf performance for men and women. Furthermore, when social desirability ratings were partialed out, correlations of psychological factors with performance were almost universally strengthened. Several of the measures maintained significant correlations with performance even after a measure of physical ability was statistically controlled. Discriminant function analyses revealed that each of the measures was also effective at discriminating the men who participated in the Pac- 10 Tournament from those who didn't but similar analyses for the women were not significant. Structural equation modeling provided tentative support for the causal influence of these psychological factors on performance. The implications of this study for future research are discussed...|$|R
60|$|I was too late. By {{the time}} I reached the water's edge {{he was a}} hundred yards away, making the boat <b>spring</b> with every <b>stroke</b> of his {{powerful}} arms. I uttered a wild cry of impotent anger, and stamped {{up and down the}} sands like a maniac. He turned and saw me. Rising from his seat he made me a graceful bow, and waved his hand to me. It was not a triumphant or a derisive gesture. Even my furious and distempered mind recognised it as being a solemn and courteous leave-taking. Then he settled down to his oars once more, and the little skiff shot away out over the bay. The sun had gone down now, leaving a single dull, red streak upon the water, which stretched away until it blended with the purple haze on the horizon. Gradually the skiff grew smaller and smaller as it sped across this lurid band, until the shades of night gathered round it and it became a mere blur upon the lonely sea. Then this vague loom died away also and darkness settled over it--a darkness which should never be raised.|$|R
40|$|We propose an {{oscillation}} {{system to}} replicate the dynamic behavior of flapping wings, inspired by insect flight muscles. In particular, we study the flight of the fruit fly Drosophila virilis. We model the wing as a rigid body with three degree-of-freedom, described by three Euler angles: the stroke angle, the rotation angle and the deviation angle. Insect flight muscles are separated into two types: power muscles and control muscles. One actuator and one torsional <b>spring</b> at the <b>stroke</b> angle act as the power muscles. Two torsional springs at the rotation angle and the deviation angle mimic the control muscles. A dynamic model, using a blade-element model and a quasi-steady model to calculate aerodynamic forces and moments, is set up for analysis of the system 2 ̆ 7 s performance. Using non-dimensional analysis, {{we are able to}} identify the dynamic behavior of the system through four coefficients: stroke stiffness coefficient, rotation stiffness coefficient, deviation stiffness coefficient and input torque coefficient. We use the dynamic model to explore a large coefficients space of the oscillation system. We find that tuning deviation stiffness coefficient and rotation stiffness coefficient generates four different types of wing trajectories. Among them, the one with a high deviation stiffness coefficient and a mediate rotation stiffness coefficient produces high lift and high power loading. Its wing trajectory is quite similar to the wing trajectory in actual insects. Furthermore, a hybrid optimization algorithm (a genetic algorithm and a Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm) is implemented to find the optimal stiffness coefficients. Through these coefficients, the system minimizes power loading while still providing enough lift to maintain a time-averaged constant altitude over one stroke cycle. The results of this optimization indicate that the flapping wing with nonzero deviation achieves a better aerodynamic performance than the wing with zero deviation. The oscillatory property of this system does not only explain how insects use flight muscles to tune wing kinematics, but it also allows for design simplifications of the wing driving mechanism of flapping micro air vehicles. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} how experimental results, from {{wave power}} research performed offshore at the Lysekil research site, were obtained. The data {{were used to}} verify theoretical models as well as evaluate the feasibility of wave power as a future sustainable energy source. The first experiments carried out at the research site was the measurement of the force in a line where one end was connected to a buoy with a diameter of 3 m and the other end {{to a set of}} <b>springs</b> with limited <b>stroke</b> length. The system is exposed to high peak forces compared to average forces. The maximum measured force in the line, when the buoy motion is limited by a stiff stopper rope is ten times the average force in that particular sea state. The experiment performed on the first wave energy converter tested at the Lysekil Research Site is described. The infrastructure of the site is presented where the central connection point is the measuring station. The key finding is {{that it is possible to}} transform the motions of ocean waves into electrical energy and distribute it to land. Many wave energy converters must be interconnected if large amounts of energy are to be harvested from the waves. The first submerged substation intended for aggregation of energy from wave power converters is described, with focus on the measurement and control system placed inside the substation. During this experiment period the generators were equipped with many different sensors; these measurements are explained in the thesis. The system that aggregates power from the studied wave energy converter is regularly exposed to peak power of up to 20 times the maximum average output from the converter. Vertical and horizontal movement of the buoy has been measured in different ways. The result is that the vertical displacement of the buoy can be measured with a simple accelerometer circuit but it is much more complicated to measure the horizontal displacement. A special method for measuring the horizontal displacement has been implemented by measuring the strain in the enclosure and the force in the line.

Rebecca Reichenbach – CCSD Action Research: Understanding the Urban Heat Island Effect (repeats Afternoon Concurrent Session # 1) Abstract: Due to the unique placement of Western High School within a concrete and asphalt island and a result construction project to rebuild it, a group of science teachers from Western High became interested in how the new construction would affect the urban heat island footprint of their school. A student project was developed to track and document the construction process over a two-year timeframe. The participating teachers used action research to study the impact of the project on their teaching practice and student learning. Three inquiry-style laboratory activities were created to teach students about heat concepts and the effect of heat islands. A misconceptions survey, along with student journaling, were used as data sources for determining changes in student understanding. Results show significant conceptual change in the grade 9 students, with less significant change for the older student population. This presentation will describe the research context, process, and its impact on participating students and teachers. Allison Brody, Amy Page – Environmental Literacy as an Indicator for Urban Sustainability Abstract: For sustainability initiatives to be successful, citizens must have the knowledge, action skills, and motivation to support and participate in these initiatives. In other words, Urban Sustainability will not be successful unless our citizens are environmentally literate. The responsibility for creating this “environmentally literate” citizenry should fall in large part to educators, both in the formal and non-formal sectors. Therefore, these educators need a clear understanding of the specific knowledge and action skills that our citizens need. In this session, we will explore the competencies that citizens need to engage in sustainability practices in Nevada, and how educators can incorporate these competencies into their curricula and programs.

60|$|When {{he stepped}} off the {{straight}} and narrow path of his peculiar honesty, it was with an inward assertion of unflinching resolve to fall back again into the monotonous but safe stride of virtue as soon as his little excursion into the wayside quagmires had produced the desired effect. It {{was going to be a}} short episode--a sentence in brackets, so to speak--in the flowing tale of his life: a thing of no moment, to be done unwillingly, yet neatly, and to be quickly forgotten. He imagined that he could go on afterwards looking at the sunshine, enjoying the shade, breathing in the perfume of flowers in the small garden before his house. He fancied that nothing would be changed, that he would be able as heretofore to tyrannize good-humouredly over his half-caste wife, to notice with tender contempt his pale yellow child, to patronize loftily his dark-skinned brother-in-law, who loved pink neckties and wore patent-leather boots on his little feet, and was so humble before the white husband of the lucky sister. Those were the delights of his life, and he was unable to conceive that the moral significance of any act of his could interfere with the very nature of things, could dim the light of the sun, could destroy the perfume of the flowers, the submission of his wife, the smile of his child, the awe-struck respect of Leonard da Souza and of all the Da Souza family. That family's admiration was the great luxury of his life. It rounded and completed his existence in a perpetual assurance of unquestionable superiority. He loved to breathe the coarse incense they offered before the shrine of the successful white man; the man that had done them the honour to marry their daughter, sister, cousin; the rising man sure to climb very high; the confidential clerk of Hudig & Co. They were a numerous and an unclean crowd, living in ruined bamboo houses, surrounded by neglected compounds, on the outskirts of Macassar. He kept them at arm's length and even further off, perhaps, having no illusions as to their worth. They were a half-caste, lazy lot, and he saw them as they were--ragged, lean, unwashed, undersized men of various ages, shuffling about aimlessly in slippers; motionless old women who looked like monstrous bags of pink calico stuffed with shapeless lumps of fat, and deposited askew upon decaying rattan chairs in shady corners of dusty verandahs; young women, slim and yellow, big-eyed, long-haired, moving languidly amongst the dirt and rubbish of their dwellings as if every step they took was going to be their very last. He heard their shrill quarrellings, the squalling of their children, the grunting of their pigs; he smelt the odours of the heaps of garbage in their courtyards: and he was greatly disgusted. But he fed and clothed that shabby multitude; those degenerate descendants of Portuguese conquerors; he was their providence; he kept them singing his praises in the midst of their laziness, of their dirt, of their immense and hopeless squalor: and he was greatly delighted. They wanted much, but he could give them all they wanted without ruining himself. In exchange he had their silent fear, their loquacious love, their noisy veneration. It is a fine thing to be a providence, and to be told so on every day of one's life. It gives one a feeling of enormously remote superiority, and Willems revelled in it. He did not analyze the state of his mind, but probably his greatest delight lay in the unexpressed but intimate conviction that, should he close his hand, all those admiring human beings would starve. His munificence had demoralized them. An easy task. Since he descended amongst them and married Joanna they had lost the little aptitude and strength for work they might have had to put forth under the stress of extreme necessity. They lived now by the grace of his will. This was power. Willems loved it. In another, and perhaps a lower plane, his days did not want for their less complex but more obvious pleasures. He liked the simple games of skill--billiards; also games not so simple, and calling for quite another kind of skill--poker. He had been the aptest pupil of a steady-eyed, sententious American, who had drifted mysteriously into Macassar from the wastes of the Pacific, and, after knocking about for a time in the eddies of town life, had drifted out enigmatically into the sunny solitudes of the Indian Ocean. The memory of the Californian stranger was perpetuated in the game of poker--which became popular in the capital of Celebes from that time--and in a powerful cocktail, the recipe for which is transmitted--in the Kwang-tung dialect--from head boy to head boy of the Chinese servants in the Sunda Hotel even to this day. Willems was a connoisseur in the drink and an adept at the game. Of those accomplishments he was moderately proud. Of the confidence reposed in him by Hudig--the master--he was boastfully and obtrusively proud. This arose from his great benevolence, and from an exalted sense of his duty to himself and the world at large. He experienced that irresistible impulse to impart information which is inseparable from gross ignorance. There is always some one thing which the ignorant man knows, and that thing is the only thing worth knowing; it fills the ignorant man's universe. Willems knew all about himself. On the day when, with many misgivings, he ran away from a Dutch East-Indiaman in Samarang roads, he had commenced that study of himself, of his own ways, of his own abilities, of those fate-compelling qualities of his which led him toward that lucrative position which he now filled. Being of a modest and diffident nature, his successes amazed, almost frightened him, and ended--as he got over the succeeding shocks of surprise--by making him ferociously conceited. He believed in his genius and in his knowledge of the world. Others should know of it also; for their own good and for his greater glory. All those friendly men who slapped him on the back and greeted him noisily should have the benefit of his example. For that he must talk. He talked to them conscientiously. In the afternoon he expounded his theory of success over the little tables, dipping now and then his moustache in the crushed ice of the cocktails; in the evening he would often hold forth, cue in hand, to a young listener across the billiard table. The billiard balls stood still as if listening also, under the vivid brilliance of the shaded oil lamps hung low over the cloth; while away in the shadows of the big room the Chinaman marker would lean wearily against the wall, the blank mask of his face looking pale under the mahogany marking-board; his eyelids dropped in the drowsy fatigue of late hours and in the buzzing monotony of the unintelligible stream of words poured out by the white man. In a sudden pause of the talk the game would recommence with a sharp click and go on for a time in the flowing soft whirr and the subdued thuds as the balls rolled zig-zagging towards the inevitably successful cannon. Through the big windows and the open doors the salt dampness of the sea, the vague smell of mould and flowers from the garden of the hotel drifted in and mingled with the odour of lamp oil, growing heavier as the night advanced. The players' heads dived into the light as they bent down for the <b>stroke,</b> <b>springing</b> back again smartly into the greenish gloom of broad lamp-shades; the clock ticked methodically; the unmoved Chinaman continuously repeated the score in a lifeless voice, like a big talking doll--and Willems would win the game. With a remark that it was getting late, and that he was a married man, he would say a patronizing good-night and step out into the long, empty street. At that hour its white dust was like a dazzling streak of moonlight where the eye sought repose in the dimmer gleam of rare oil lamps. Willems walked homewards, following the line of walls overtopped by the luxuriant vegetation of the front gardens. The houses right and left were hidden behind the black masses of flowering shrubs. Willems had the street to himself. He would walk in the middle, his shadow gliding obsequiously before him. He looked down on it complacently. The shadow of a successful man! He would be slightly dizzy with the cocktails and with the intoxication of his own glory. As he often told people, he came east fourteen years ago--a cabin boy. A small boy. His shadow must have been very small at that time; he thought with a smile that he was not aware then he had anything--even a shadow--which he dared call his own. And now he was looking at the shadow of the confidential clerk of Hudig & Co. going home. How glorious! How good was life for those that were on the winning side! He had won the game of life; also the game of billiards. He walked faster, jingling his winnings, and thinking of the white stone days that had marked the path of his existence. He thought of the trip to Lombok for ponies--that first important transaction confided to him by Hudig; then he reviewed the more important affairs: the quiet deal in opium; the illegal traffic in gunpowder; the great affair of smuggled firearms, the difficult business of the Rajah of Goak. He carried that last through by sheer pluck; he had bearded the savage old ruler in his council room; he had bribed him with a gilt glass coach, which, rumour said, was used as a hen-coop now; he had over-persuaded him; he had bested him in every way. That was the way to get on. He disapproved of the elementary dishonesty that dips the hand in the cash-box, but one could evade the laws and push the principles of trade to their furthest consequences. Some call that cheating. Those are the fools, the weak, the contemptible. The wise, the strong, the respected, have no scruples. Where there are scruples there can be no power. On that text he preached often to the young men. It was his doctrine, and he, himself, was a shining example of its truth.|$|R
