25|$|At Pixy Cove, Poirot {{and police}} find {{a pair of}} new scissors, a {{fragment}} of pipe that could belong to many smokers, and heroin hidden in a cave (which turns out {{to belong to the}} heroin-smuggling Sir Horace Blatt). Inside the cave, Poirot also sniffs a delicate exclusive perfume only used by Arlena and Rosamund. Poirot invites everyone on a picnic to test their vertigo. Christine and Emily both claimed fear of heights (acrophobia), but Christine easily traverses the bridge – thus she lied. After the picnic, Linda is found overdosed on six of Christine's sleeping pills, and almost dies. She has written a confession but Poirot finds her library book about magic, melted wax and a pin, and realises she mistook piercing a voodoo image for murder. Christine made <b>sure</b> <b>her</b> tablets were handy, provoking the guilt-ridden Linda to take them.|$|E
25|$|The Mongols practiced polygamy. Ögedei Khan's {{favorite}} son was Kochu, {{who was his}} through another wife, and he had nominated Kochu's son Siremun to succeed him after his father suddenly died in China in 1237. But some sources mention that Khoch was a son of Töregene {{and she did not}} want little Shiremun to succeed. Töregene opposed the choice in favor of Güyük, but despite the enormous influence she had on him, she was unable to persuade Ögedei to change his selection. She did, however, achieve her aims through cunning. When the lesser khans appointed her regent after her husband's death, she appointed her favorites to high positions in the imperial household and initiated what was to be a successful scheme to elevate her son Güyük. When Temüge Otchigen, the youngest brother of Genghis, gathered his men and tried to unsuccessfully seize the throne, Güyük quickly came to meet him. Töregene managed to keep a Kurultai from being held until it was <b>sure</b> <b>her</b> son Güyük was favored by the majority. Töregene passed power onto to her son Güyük in 1246. She retired west to Ögedei's appanage on the Emil.|$|E

500|$|... "Get Me Bodied" [...] is an R {{and bounce}} song with dancehall and reggae influences. It {{features}} Beyoncé as the female protagonist going out an {{evening in the}} right dress and the right hair, to steam up any dance floor and make <b>sure</b> <b>her</b> call to [...] "get her bodied" [...] is irresistible. The song was generally well received by contemporary music critics, who complimented its party sound and Beyoncé's vocals. The American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) recognized it as the best R and Hip-Hop song of 2007. [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] initially reached number 68 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart in 2007, but due to a viral video reached a new peak of 46 in 2013.|$|E
500|$|While {{the news}} story {{initially}} inspired Stead, she also tied in parts of her childhood into the novel. Besides the laughing man, she included her primary school, her apartment and a sandwich store where she used to work. Stead also added memories of herself acting mean without reason. Slowly the novel became [...] "more and more about these ordinary mysteries of life and less about the fantastic time-travel-y one". After developing the basic idea, Stead began researching the science behind time travel to make <b>sure</b> <b>her</b> ideas would be logical. She asked her father for help with the science and complicated technical aspects, since he enjoyed mathematical puzzles. As they talked about time travel, Stead [...] "just kept falling into the same hole with the logic, and he really helped me straighten it out".|$|E
500|$|Following the {{coronation}} {{of her daughter}} as queen, Anne was venerated as a martyr and heroine of the English Reformation, particularly through the works of John Foxe, who argued that Anne had saved England from the evils of Roman Catholicism and that God had provided proof of her innocence and virtue by making <b>sure</b> <b>her</b> daughter Elizabeth I ascended the throne. An example of Anne's direct influence in the reformed church is what Alexander Ales described to Queen Elizabeth as the [...] "evangelical bishops whom your holy mother appointed from among those scholars who favoured the purer doctrine". Over the centuries, Anne has inspired or been mentioned in numerous artistic and cultural works. As a result, she has remained in the popular memory and has been called [...] "the most influential and important queen consort England has ever had." ...|$|E

500|$|Former Batman {{writer and}} editor Dennis O'Neil and Oracle co-creator John Ostrander have {{expressed}} disappointment over the change. O'Neil stated that during his tenure at DC, [...] "e had hordes of people in spandex beating up criminals... We didn't have anybody like Oracle, who overcame a disability and was just as valuable and just as effective {{in a way that}} didn't involve violence." [...] However, he also stated that from an alternate point of view, [...] "Barbara Gordon's perception in the mainstream public as Batgirl would be a very valid consideration." [...] Ostrander continues to view Oracle as a stronger character than Batgirl, but has also expressed faith in Gail Simone's skills as a writer. He commented that [...] "imes change and characters and people evolve. I changed things when I wrote characters, including changing Barbara to Oracle. Others do the same for this era... Gail Simone is a good friend and a wonderful writer and I'm <b>sure</b> <b>her</b> work will be wonderful." ...|$|E
500|$|Since 1994, Hewson {{has been}} a patron of Chernobyl Children's Project International (shortened to Chernobyl Children International in 2010), an {{organisation}} founded and run by Roche that works with children, families, and communities that continue {{to be affected by}} Chernobyl. Through the years, Hewson has taken at least ten trips to Belarus and other nations in the region despite the risk to her health. [...] She has organised overland aid convoys and sometimes driven ambulances filled with medical supplies herself; in one case she had to retreat quickly when a fire spread in a village a few miles from Chernobyl. [...] Hewson has made <b>sure</b> <b>her</b> own children met those from Chernobyl with birth deformities and other illnesses, so that they would have a broader appreciation of the world and what to be thankful for. She has said that fundraising for those affected is very difficult, given that many people believe the problems of Chernobyl are all in the past.|$|E
500|$|On 18 June 1999, Ackah {{anonymously}} telephoned Brent social services, expressing {{concern over}} Climbié's situation. Samantha Hunt, the customer-service officer {{who received the}} call at the One Stop Shop at Brent House, faxed the referral to the children's social work department on that same day. Nobody picked up the referral on that Friday afternoon, {{and what happened to}} it was—according to Lord Laming, who headed the subsequent inquiry—the subject of [...] "some of the most bizarre and contradictory evidence" [...] the inquiry heard. A few days later, possibly on 21 June 1999, Ackah phoned Brent social services again to make <b>sure</b> <b>her</b> concerns were being addressed. Ackah said that she was told by the person {{on the other end of}} the telephone that [...] "probably they [...] had done something about it". This call, however, did not trigger a new, separate referral. The first referral was not seen until three weeks later on 6 July 1999, when Robert Smith, the group administrative officer, logged the details of the referral onto the computer, with details of Climbié's injuries. Laming said the delay constituted [...] "a significant missed opportunity" [...] to protect Climbié. Edward Armstrong, the team manager of the intake duty team, said that he completed a duty manager's action sheet not for the 18 June referral, which he said never arrived in his office, but for the 21 June referral, which was a less serious case than the first; Laming called this version of events [...] "wholly unbelievable". Laming said that Armstrong's evidence was out of line with that of the other Brent witnesses, that the quality of it [...] " [...] much to be desired", and that Armstrong's insistence that he dealt with the 21 June referral was an attempt to cover up his team's [...] "inept handling" [...] of a genuine child protection case.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his final}} report, Major General Antonio Taguba blamed Karpinski for the abuse, {{indicating}} {{she had not}} {{paid attention to the}} daily operations of the prison. According to Taguba, Karpinski rarely visited the prisons during her tenure, and she reviewed and signed reports about claims of abuse without following up to make <b>sure</b> <b>her</b> orders were carried out. As a consequence, the abuse was allowed to continue and her subordinates developed a lax attitude towards protocol. Karpinski was cited throughout the [...] for repeated violations of Army procedure, good management and exercising her command as directed by Army regulations. During interviews cited in the Taguba report, Karpinski was described as disconnected from the operations of her area of command.|$|E
