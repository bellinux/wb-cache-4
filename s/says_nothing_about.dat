5|$|In Belarus, {{the right}} to vote in {{elections}} and plebiscites is extended to those who are above the age of eighteen. During elections and plebiscites, a citizen can vote or not vote without any consequences from the government. The Constitution describes two methods of preventing a citizen from voting. First, a court can issue an order stating that the citizen does not have the mental capacity to understand and to cast a ballot. Second, a person being held in detention or confined in a prison during an election cannot cast a ballot. The Constitution <b>says</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> the voting rights of those who have served their prison terms, nor does it state how those citizens gain the rights back.|$|E

However, by itself materialism <b>says</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> how material substance should be characterized. In practice, it is frequently assimilated to one variety of physicalism or another.|$|E
25|$|Numbers in JSON are {{agnostic}} {{with regard}} to their representation within programming languages. No differentiation is made between an integer and floating-point value: some implementations may treat 42, 42.0, and 4.2E+1 as the same number while others may not. Furthermore, no requirements are made regarding implementation issues such as overflow, underflow, loss of precision, or rounding. Additionally, JSON <b>says</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> the treatment of signed zeros: whether 0.0 is distinct from -0.0. Most implementations that use the IEEE 754 floating-point standard, including JavaScript, preserve signed zeros; but not all JSON implementations may do so.|$|E

25|$|Naturalism of {{this sort}} <b>says</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> the {{existence}} or nonexistence of the supernatural, which by this definition is beyond natural testing. As a practical consideration, the rejection of supernatural explanations would merely be pragmatic, thus it would nonetheless be possible, for an ontological supernaturalist to espouse and practice methodological naturalism. For example, scientists may believe in God while practicing methodological naturalism in their scientific work. This position does not preclude knowledge that is somehow connected to the supernatural. Generally however, {{anything that can be}} scientifically examined and explained would not be supernatural, simply by definition.|$|E

The proportion of Christians {{is based on the}} proportion of the population in each country who are members of a Christian denomination or who identify themselves as Christian. It <b>says</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> the proportion of such as believe in God and are regularly in the church. People who mix Christianity with tribal religions are defined in this article as Christians. Most of the percentage of Christian population of each country was taken from the US State Department's International Religious Freedom Report, the CIA World Factbook, Joshua Project, Open doors, Pew Forum and Adherents.com.|$|E
25|$|While {{labor force}} {{participation}} rate {{sheds light on}} how many women work in the formal sectors of the economy, it <b>says</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> the type of work or the stable presence {{of women in the}} labor force. Countries such as Bangladesh and Indonesia, when female labor force participation rate or the ratio of male to female workers or similar indicators are considered, appear to have substantial female involvement in their economies. However, very few of the women in these nations have salaried work which means they may go through cycles of short periods of work punctuated by long periods of unemployment. Alternatively, these women may be shuffled from task to task for different employers and never develop a stable basis at a particular firm or within a particular field.|$|E

25|$|The order {{sought by}} BHP was {{to prevent the}} Arbitration Court from {{enforcing}} the award, however the decision <b>says</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> who may enforce the award, in that section 44 permits any affected union member to enforce the award before any magistrate. The argument {{set out in the}} law report does not address the question of whether prohibition was the appropriate remedy and none of the judges referred to the issue. The traditional supervisory writ to keep an inferior court within the bounds of its authority was the writ of certiorari by which the decision of the lower court is brought up and quashed. The constitution however omits certiorari from those powers contained in setting out the original jurisdiction of the High Court. In this way the High Court granted prohibition where certiorari would have been an appropriate remedy and extended the scope of prohibition beyond generally accepted limits.|$|E
25|$|The Second Circuit Court of Appeals {{overturned}} in 3-0 {{ruling on}} July 17, 2013 Judge’s Forrest ruling which struck down § 1021(b)(2) {{of the controversial}} U.S. military-detention law NDAA as unconstitutional because the plaintiffs lacked legal standing to challenge it. The Court of Appeals overturned Forrest’s decision in a 60-page ruling and lifted her injunction, saying that Christopher Hedges and another plaintiff weren’t eligible to challenge the law because it “simply <b>says</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> the government’s authority to detain citizens.” The court held that under their interpretation the government could not use the particular law challenged by the citizen plaintiffs to militarily detain them, so they had no basis for the court to hear their case. But the court acknowledged that this doesn’t mean that the government could not rely on other laws, including the AUMF {{to the events of}} September 11, to justify indefinite military detention of citizens. The court concluded that the non-citizen plaintiffs had no reasonable fear of being detained and thus could not have their challenge of the law adjudicated by the court. “And while Section 1021 does have a real bearing on those who are neither citizens nor lawful resident aliens and who are apprehended abroad, the non-citizen plaintiffs also have failed to establish standing because they have not shown a sufficient threat that the government will detain them under Section 1021,” the court said.|$|E

[...] It was in this {{interview}} that Jackson stated he had a skin disorder (vitiligo) and also stated that the disorder was hereditary, rather than something he caused; he also said he used make-up to even out the uneven skin tone. [...] "It is something I cannot help," [...] explained Jackson. [...] "When people make up stories that I don't want to be who I am, it hurts me. It's a problem for me. I can't control it. But what about all the millions of people who sit in the sun to become darker, to become other than what they are. Nobody <b>says</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> that." [...] Winfrey's interview of Jackson was watched by 62million Americans. It also started a public discourse on the topic of vitiligo, a relatively unknown condition before then.|$|E
500|$|The Zhou yi was {{traditionally}} {{ascribed to}} the Zhou cultural heroes King Wen of Zhou and the Duke of Zhou, and was also associated with the legendary world ruler Fu Xi. [...] According to the canonical Great Commentary, Fu Xi observed the patterns {{of the world and}} created the eight trigrams (...) , [...] "in order to become thoroughly conversant with the numinous and bright and to classify the myriad things." [...] The Zhou yi itself does not contain this legend and indeed <b>says</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>about</b> its own origins. The Rites of Zhou, however, also claims that the hexagrams of the Zhou yi were derived from an initial set of eight trigrams. During the Han dynasty there were various opinions about the historical relationship between the trigrams and the hexagrams. Eventually, a consensus formed around 2nd century AD scholar Ma Rong's attribution of the text to the joint work of Fu Xi, King Wen of Zhou, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius, but this traditional attribution is no longer generally accepted.|$|E
