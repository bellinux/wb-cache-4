From this point, it follows King Highway over and then along the Kalamazoo River through a <b>suburban</b> <b>residential</b> <b>area.</b> The highway then follows Michigan Avenue east through Comstock {{and north of}} Morrow Lake. At Galesburg, M-96 turns northeast along Augusta Drive to Augusta, running through rural farmland.

40|$|Most of the <b>suburban</b> <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> in Germany {{have been}} built {{during the second half}} of the 20 th century. Growing {{interest}} among practitioners and scientists is thus paid to the future development of maturing settlement areas characterized by old housing stock and aging inhabitants. This dissertation analyzes processes of change and adaption of <b>suburban</b> <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> under the conditions of the maturation process. The analysis aims on contributing to the systemic notion of processes changing maturing systems within their natural lifecycle and its interdependence with deliberate adaption under particular stakeholders’ constellations. On the theoretically conceptual level it seeks to explore the key attributes of the development path for evolutionary lifecycles within the context of resilience, discussing the phenomena of stable maturity and continuous adjustment and on the concept of settlement space. By deconstructing the lifecycle concept, the book analyzes the canonical view on mature suburbia based in the traditional growth-maturity-decline pattern and introduces a pluralistic concept of path dependent evolution based on a multi­leveled interdependence between particular levels of space, stakeholders‘ panarchy and adaptive action. On behalf of outcomes based in theory and the results from two empirical studies conducted in German mature <b>suburban</b> <b>residential</b> <b>areas,</b> a concept of multi-leveled ‘systemic space’ as both interpretative and analytic tool for understanding development paths of mature suburban systems is introduced. The results of its application on the case studies show that, especially in terms of homogeneity and diversity, lifecycles of <b>suburban</b> <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> underlie different conditions for change and adaption during the early and the ­maturity phases, and defines interpretative frames for conceptualizing both theiretical and research approaches. Hereby, it issue the locally based stakeholders’ panarchy as the central adaption-steering potential, putting it at the core of strategic planning interest in mature <b>suburban</b> <b>residential</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, two new branch {{lines have been}} opened in 1999 to connect recent {{residential}} developments in the northwest (Dolgoe Ozero, Komendantsky Aerodrom, Lakhtinsky Razliv) to the newly opened Staraya Derevnya station on the Saint Petersburg Metro. Following a change in 'Gorelectrotrans' management in September 2005, more than 20 additional km of unduplicated tracks had been withdrawn, including not only centrally located lines, but also a 3km section in a <b>suburban</b> <b>residential</b> <b>area.</b> This withdrawal seriously affected the system's logistical capabilities. There is a strong lobby for more withdrawals from the road construction administration, which believes that decreasing tram traffic will give more freedom to automobile traffic.|$|E
25|$|The Drammen Line {{past the}} site of Høvik Station opened as a narrow gauge railway on 7 October 1872. The railway station serving Høvik opened on 1 May 1874. It was the first railway station between Sandvika Station and Lysaker Station. The new means of {{transport}} allowed the Høvik area to develop as a <b>suburban</b> <b>residential</b> <b>area</b> allowing commuters {{to travel to the}} capital. The original station building was a standard design by Georg Andreas Bull used for most stations along the Drammen Line. In addition to a station building it featured a Narvesen kiosk. A spur to load cars with compost and garbage was installed in 1908. Bærum Municipality established a public library for Høvik in 1911. From their establishment to 1924 they were located next to the station building.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the next decade, another longstanding building from the early years of Ossining, the Union Hotel at South Highland and Church Street, was demolished. A Romanesque Revival doctor's office building replaced it. In 1892 the corner section of the Barlow Block was separated internally {{from the rest of the}} building so it could serve as Ossining's post office, the first of two former locations for that facility within the district. The next year the village's electric trolley system was established, with its main line going down Croton Avenue from the then-undeveloped Ossining Heights area in the northeast corner of the village to Main Street, where a spur ran down to Sparta, and then continuing to the train station. Residents could more easily travel downtown, and Ossining Heights soon became the <b>suburban</b> <b>residential</b> <b>area</b> it is today.|$|E

500|$|After briefly {{passing through}} Hennepin County in the {{communities}} of St. Bonifacius and Minnetrista, MN7 crosses back into Carver County. In the city of Victoria the highway rounds {{the southern end of}} Lake Minnetonka. As MN7 begins to turn back northeasterly, it crosses into western Hennepin County at Shorewood. The highway widens out to a four-lane divided highway near the intersection with MN41. This divided highway has a partial interchange with Mill Street in Excelsior near the St. Albans Bay of Lake Minnetonka. This area transitions into a full <b>suburban</b> <b>residential</b> <b>area</b> by the time the highway crosses into Minnetonka. The highway passes north of the campus for Minnetonka High School near the intersection with County Road101 (CR101). Access to MN7 through the area is restricted to major intersections only for the most part, making the highway an expressway rather than a true freeway. While still in Minnetonka, MN7 passes through a cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 494 (I-494) which is one half of the Twin Cities' beltway. Immediately adjacent to the cloverleaf is another [...] interchange for CR60 (Baker Road). The expressway continues northeasterly through the suburb of Hopkins before crossing into St. Louis Park.|$|E

40|$|Traffic noise {{can be a}} major nuisance, {{particularly}} in <b>residential</b> <b>areas.</b> Road traffic noise {{is the most significant}} source of environmental noise pollution. Exposure to noise pollution contributes to negative impact on the environment particularly to human. Therefore, in order to overcome this problem, the development of models that can predict the traffic noise is necessary. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop models of traffic noise at <b>suburban</b> <b>residential</b> <b>areas</b> along FT 50 Federal Route. This study is carried out at Taman Kelisa, Taman Gading and Taman Gading 1. A total of 42 data in each <b>residential</b> <b>area</b> are used to analyze the noise level and the relationship with other traffic parameters. In this study, traffic noise models are clustered into three groups of variables. In summary, most predictors in this study affect the level of noise at study locations. Cluster 2 shows the most reliable model since the adjusted R-squared is the highest with 60. 7 percent. The developed models can be hopefully utilized for traffic noise prediction in the future for <b>suburban</b> <b>residential</b> <b>areas...</b>|$|R
