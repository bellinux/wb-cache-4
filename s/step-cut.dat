60|$|We {{believe that}} this is the firmest method of {{fastening}} which can be adopted, and that so long as the wood is sound, it is scarcely possible for the head of the axe to get loose or to come off; and it has the further advantage of strengthening the wood instead of weakening it, and of distributing the strain produced by <b>step-cutting</b> over a large bearing.

60|$|For {{the other}} cutter we {{recommend}} an adze-shaped blade, {{and we are}} convinced {{that this is the}} form which will be found most generally useful, as being best suited for all the varieties of <b>step-cutting.</b> The hatchet-shaped blade used by the Chamouni guides is no doubt a better implement for making a staircase diagonally up a slope, {{but on the other hand}} it is exceedingly difficult to cut steps downwards with a blade set on in this manner; and as mountaineers rarely come down the way by which they went up, if they can help it, it is obvious that this objection to the Chamouni form of axe is conclusive.|$|R
25|$|Stones whose {{outlines}} {{are either}} square or rectangular and whose facets are rectilinear and arranged {{parallel to the}} girdle are known as step- or trap-cut stones. These stones often have their corners truncated, creating an emerald cut (after its most common application to emerald gemstones) with an octagonal outline. This is done because sharp corners are points of weakness where a diamond may cleave or fracture. Instead of a culet, <b>step-cut</b> stones have a keel running {{the length of the}} pavilion terminus.

A special type of pliers are used to push in the spring-loaded plunger. This pushes down on the <b>step-cut</b> locks, which pushes {{them away from the}} spreader bars and allows them to come together. This allows the user to slip the locking jaws through a hole made through multiple sheets of material. When the plunger is released the spring pulls the locking jaws back towards the spreader bar, which separates the two jaws. The material sheets are then squeezed in between the <b>step-cut</b> area and the steel cylinder. This keeps the holes in the separate sheets aligned.|$|E

50|$|For {{travel on}} slopes {{consisting}} of ice or hard snow, crampons are a standard {{part of a}} mountaineer's equipment. While <b>step-cutting</b> can sometimes be used on snow slopes of moderate angle, {{this can be a}} slow and tiring process, which does not provide the higher security of crampons. However, in soft snow or powder, crampons are easily hampered by balling of snow, which reduces their effectiveness. In either case, an ice axe not only assists with balance but provides the climber with the possibility of self-arrest in case of a slip or fall. On a true ice slope however, an ice axe is rarely able to effect a self-arrest. As an additional safety precaution on steep ice slopes, the climbing rope is attached to ice screws buried into the ice.|$|R

Like many other climbers, Tuckett took with him a barometer and made scientific observations. He noted the icy temperature and the very strong wind, blowing the snow and threatening to knock over the climbers.|$|R
50|$|In March 1879, Peter Kaufmann {{began his}} own {{career as a}} {{certified}} mountain guide. He had successfully fulfilled {{the requirements of the}} licensing body for Swiss guides in Interlaken. After instruction in various matters connected with the mountains, their geography, as well as the dangers connected with snow, ice, glaciers, and rock such as “the perils of couloirs, hidden crevasses, bergschrunds, and snow bridges,” he had been schooled in first-aid, including treatment and careful transportation of the injured. Moreover, he was expected to know how to avoid accidents and how to act prudently in the event of one. He was required “to be thoroughly acquainted with the mountains of his particular district,” the Bernese Alps, and, in a climbing test, he had to demonstrate his knowledge of the routes, the times needed for ascents, the position of peaks and passes, the use compasses and maps, ropes and ice-picks, such as <b>step-cutting.</b> Moreover, he needed “to show that he had in him the makings of a complete counselor and guardian angel to the climbers under his charge,” showing exemplary behavior at the club huts. After this rigorous training and testing, he was qualified to become an official mountain guide, so that the Governing Body of the District Authority in Interlaken certified him as a licensed guide and issued a paginated, leather-bound book (Führerbuch) in which his future clients could write their comments.|$|R
60|$|Axes.--The axes made in England for {{the purpose}} of being taken out to Switzerland, may be divided into two classes, namely: travellers' axes, {{intended}} to be used for chipping a few occasional steps, for enlarging and clearing out those imperfectly made, and for holding on to a snow-slope,--and guides' axes, which are the heavier implements required for making long staircases in hard blue ice. We have had three models prepared, of which diagrams are appended; the first two represent the lighter axe, or what we have termed the travellers' axe; and the third, the heavier instrument required for guides' work. Diagram No. 1 represents a light axe or pick, of a kind somewhat similar to that recommended by Mr. Stephen, in a paper published a short time ago in the 'Journal.' It has, in the first place, the great advantage of lightness and handiness, while its single blade, to some extent, combines the <b>step-cutting</b> qualities possessed by the two cutters of the ordinary double-headed axe, though the latter instrument is on the whole decidedly superior. The small hammer-headed axe, though the latter instrument is on the whole decidedly superior. The small hammer-head at the back is added in order to balance the pick, and in some degree to improve the hold when the axe-head comes {{to be used as a}} crutch handle. This form, it should be understood, we recommend on account of its lightness and of its convenient shape. Diagram No. 2 represents a travellers' axe, slightly heavier than the first; and as this is the shape which appears to us the best adapted for mountain work of all kinds, we desire shortly to state our reasons for recommending it to members of the Club.|$|R

5000|$|The account {{below is}} {{extracted}} almost verbatim from True Tales of Mountain Adventure: For Non-Climbers Young and Old (1903): In August 1880 Émile Rey and Andreas Maurer were guiding an English 'climber', {{who wanted to}} reach {{the summit of the}} Aiguille du Plan by means of the steep ice slopes the Glacier du Planabove the Chamonix Valley. After <b>step-cutting</b> all day, they reached a point where to go on was impossible, and retreat looked hopeless. To add to their difficulties, bad weather came in with snow and intense cold. They had no alternative but to remain exactly where they were for the night, and, if they survived it, to attempt the descent of the almost precipitous ice-slopes they had with such difficulty ascended. Through the long hours of the bitter night, they stood, roped together, without daring to move, on a narrow ridge, hacked level with their ice-axes. They believed their case was hopeless. Although Andreas Maurer's own back was frozen hard to the ice-wall against which he leaned, and in spite of driving snow and numbing cold, he opened his coat, waistcoat and shirt, and through the long hours of the night he held, pressed against his bare chest, the half-frozen body of the traveller who had urged him to undertake the expedition. The morning broke, still and clear, and at six o'clock, having thawed their stiffened limbs in the warm sun, they commenced the descent. Probably no finer feat in ice-work has ever been performed than that accomplished by Maurer and Rey on that day. Had the bad weather continued, the party could not possibly have descended alive. It then took ten hours of continuous down-climbing on steep ice to reach safety, after eighteen hours of continuous effort without food on the previous day, followed by a night of horrors such as few can realise.

40|$|Background: Osteochondral {{grafting}} for {{the treatment}} of osteo-chondral lesions of the talus (OLT) usually requires a medial malleolar osteotomy (MMO) to achieve adequate intraartic-ular exposure. This study describes the technique used and the results obtained using a modified <b>step-cut</b> MMO for osteo-chondral grafting of talar dome lesions. Materials and Method: Eleven feet in ten patients underwent modified <b>step-cut</b> MMO prior to osteochondral grafting for OLT. The patients included three women and seven men {{with a mean age of}} 40 (range, 20 to 51) years. Modified <b>step-cut</b> MMO consisted of an oblique osteotomy, which was made at approximately 45 degrees to the transverse plane of the proposed traditional <b>step-cut</b> osteotomy, and a vertical osteotomy to the axilla on the medial tibial plafond. Results: In all patients, modified <b>step-cut</b> MMO provided better perpendicular access to lesions than traditional <b>step-cut</b> osteotomy. In all cases, the osteochondral graft plug was accurately set perpendicular to the defect area, and all ten patients experienced uncomplicated osteotomy healing at a mean 8 weeks postoperatively without loss of reduction or malreduction.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundLateral closing wedge {{osteotomy}} is {{a commonly}} described procedure for correcting cosmetically unacceptable post-traumatic cubitus varus deformity in children. However, complications like residual deformity, lateral prominence, loss of fixation and ulnar nerve palsies commonly contribute to poor outcomes {{with such an}} osteotomy. Patients and methodsFourteen children (11 boys and three girls) presenting a mal-united extension type supracondylar fracture of the humerus {{with an average age}} of 9. 07 years (6 – 14 years) were operated around 3. 6 years (1. 5 – 7 years) after the injury using a modified <b>step-cut</b> osteotomy. The average follow-up period was 2. 1 years (1 – 4 years). Objective assessment included measurement of preoperative and postoperative lateral prominence index, carrying angle and range of elbow motion. Results were graded excellent, good or poor as per the Oppenheim criteria. ResultsThere were eight excellent, five good and one poor result. A residual varus of more than 10 ° was seen in the single patient with poor result. None of the patients showed a prominent lateral humeral condyle or formation of hypertrophic scar. Our results were comparable to the published results of the classical lateral closing wedge osteotomy in terms of elbow motion and correction of deformity. ConclusionA modified <b>step-cut</b> osteotomy is a safe and simple procedure which prevents lateral prominence and leads to good or excellent outcomes in most of the patients. The <b>step-cut</b> osteotomy procedure, mentioned here, might be beneficial over the conventional lateral closing wedge osteotomy in certain aspects like the lateral humeral condyle prominence, scar acceptibility and cosmesis. However, the apparent aforementioned advantages of this osteotomy over the conventional lateral closing wedge osteotomy needs to be further evaluated and confirmed on the basis of large, prospective randomised controlled trials.

40|$|We have {{followed}} a consecutive series of 49 revision hip arthroplasties, performed for severe femoral bone loss using Gamma-irradiated anatomic-specific proximal femoral allografts longer than five centimetres. The patients were followed for a median 10. 2 years, with a five year minimum follow-up. The median preoperative Harris Hip Score (HHS) improved from 42 points to 77 points postoperatively. In four hips the femoral component was further revised for non-union of the allograft and aseptic failure. In one hip the allograft and the femoral component were removed because of infection. In one hip the allograft and the femoral component were re-revised for host <b>step-cut</b> fracture. Junctional-union {{was observed in}} 44 / 49 hips. By defining success as an increase of HHS by 20 points or more, a stable implant and no need for any subsequent re-operations related to the allograft and /or the implant, a success rate of 76 % was observed. Kaplan-Meier survivorship analysis predicted 79 % rate of survival at 10 years and 75 % rate of survival at 17 years, {{with the need for}} further revision of the allograft and/or implant as the end point. Three hips underwent re-attachment of the greater trochanter for trochanteric escape. Asymptomatic non-union of the greater trochanter was noticed in another three hips. Moderate allograft resorption was observed in four hips. Two fractures of the host <b>step-cut</b> occurred. There were four dislocations.

40|$|Background: Cubitus varus is a cosmetically {{unacceptable}} {{complication of}} supracondylar fractures of the elbow in children. We have performed the lateral closing wedge (French) osteotomy {{to correct the}} varus for 27 years. More complex osteotomies have been described to correct the associated hyperextension and internal rotation deformities and to prevent a prominent lateral condyle. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 90 consecutive patients (1986 - 2012). The {{mean age of the}} patients at surgery was 8. 2 years (3 to 14 years). The varus angle (mean 21. 4 °, range 8 °- 40 °) was assessed pre-operatively with the humero-elbow-wrist (HEW) angle. The postoperative carrying angle (mean 10. 4) and the pre- and postoperative range of movement were assessed clinically. The lateral condylar prominence index (LCPI) was retrospectively measured at union. Results: Seventy five (93. 3 %) of the patients had a good or excellent result. Six (6. 7 %) had a poor result (residual varus, loss of > 20 °of pre-operative range of flexion or extension or a complication necessitating repeat surgery). There were no neuro-vascular complications. The mean LCPI was + 0. 14. Conclusions: The results of the French osteotomy are comparable to the more technically demanding dome, <b>step-cut</b> translation and multi-planar osteotomies, with a lower complication rate.

40|$|Background: A {{variety of}} osteotomies has been {{proposed}} to correct posttraumatic cubitus varus deformity {{as well as any}} associated hyperextension and/or rotational deformities. However, lateral closing-wedge osteotomy and <b>step-cut</b> oste-otomy, both of which have been used extensively with satisfactory outcomes, correct only in the coronal plane. To date, no direct comparison has been made between three-dimensional and simple coronal plane osteotomies. Methods: Between 1983 and 2007, we treated eighty-six elbows with a posttraumatic varus deformity. We classified patients who underwent three-dimensional osteotomies as Group I and those who underwent simple coronal plane osteotomies as Group II, and we compared the outcomes between the groups. Clinical evaluation included an assess-ment of the carrying angle and measurement of the passive range of motion before surgery and {{at the time of the}} final follow-up. To evaluate the remodeling capacity of the bone to recover elbow flexion in Group II, we assessed the range of motion before surgery and at the time of the final follow-up in patients who were less than ten years old and those who were more than ten years old. Results: There was no significant difference between the groups with regard to the carrying angle or the elbow range of motion, either before surgery or at the time of the final follow-up. However, Group I had more significant loss of correction (p = 0. 018).

40|$|BACKGROUND Trans-olecranon chevron osteotomies (COs) {{remain the}} gold {{standard}} surgical approach to type C fractures of the distal humerus. This technique {{is associated with a}} high complication rate and development of an extra-articular olecranon osteotomy may be advantageous. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the load to failure of COs with extra-articular oblique osteotomies (OOs) as well as modified, extra-articular step osteotomies (SOs). METHODS These three osteotomies and their subsequent fixation utilizing a standardized tension band wiring technique were tested in 42 composite analog ulnae models at 20 ° and 70 ° of flexion. Triceps loading was simulated with a servo hydraulic testing machine. All specimens were isometrically loaded until failure. Kinematic and force data, as well as interfragmentary motion were recorded. RESULTS At 70 °, CO failed at a mean load of 963 N (SD 104 N), the OO at 1512 N (SD 208 N) and the SO at 1484 N (SD 153 N), (P< 0. 001). At 20 °, CO failed at a mean load of 707 N (SD 104 N) and OO at 1009 N (SD 85 N) (P= 0. 006). The highest load to failure was observed for the SO, which was 1277 N (SD 172 N). The load to failure of the SO was significantly higher than the CO as well as the OO. CONCLUSION Extra-articular osteotomies showed a significantly higher load to failure in comparison to traditional CO. At near full extension (20 ° of flexion), this biomechanical advantage was further enhanced by a <b>step-cut</b> modification of the extra-articular oblique osteotomy...|$|E
