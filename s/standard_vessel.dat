These boats were almost always full of wood, making the maintenance so expensive {{in terms of time}} and cost. It was also difficult to source parts to enable repairs. This situation prompted a project to identify a <b>standard</b> <b>vessel.</b> The standard boat also made the running of regatta’s easier as all the boats were of equal class.

50|$|The ice hold was {{equipped}} with large eutectic refrigeration plates that allowed ice to be easily kept in the 5 large bins {{on either side of}} the center line of the vessel for standard 10-day fishing trips. The hold also had a large freezer for storage of bait. This arrangement of ice and refrigeration only required running the diesel for approximately 2 hours a day to maintain temps in the hold, further saving on fuel and ice costs. Typically only about 3 tons of ice was need for a 10-day trip as opposed to the 6 to 10 tons that a <b>standard</b> <b>vessel</b> typically required. Fuel was a major cost factor for the standard grouper snapper vessels, the standard diesel driven vessels of the time could use as much as 500 to 1000 gallons on a ten-day trip where as the CSY typically used about 50 gallons and rarely used more than 100 gallons of its 500-gallon tankage. This pushed the break even point down substantially and increase profits proportionately.|$|E

40|$|The {{use of a}} 3 D model {{helps to}} {{diagnosis}} and accurately locate a disease where it is neither available, nor can be exactly measured in a 2 D image. Therefore, highly accurate software for a 3 D model of vessel is required for an accurate diagnosis of patients. We have generated <b>standard</b> <b>vessel</b> because {{the shape of the}} arterial is different for each individual vessel, where the <b>standard</b> <b>vessel</b> can be adjusted to suit individual vessel. In this paper, we propose a new approach for an automatic 3 D model generation based on a matching of adaptive control points. The proposed method is carried out in three steps. First, standard and individual vessels are acquired. The <b>standard</b> <b>vessel</b> is acquired by a 3 D model projection, while the individual vessel of the first segmented vessel bifurcation is obtained. Second is matching the corresponding control points between the standard and individual vessels, where a set of control and corner points are automatically extracted using the Harris corner detector. If control points exist between corner points in an individual vessel, it is adaptively interpolated in the corresponding <b>standard</b> <b>vessel</b> which is proportional to the distance ratio. And then, the control points of corresponding individual vessel match with those control points of <b>standard</b> <b>vessel.</b> Finally, we apply warping on the <b>standard</b> <b>vessel</b> to suit the individual vessel using the TPS (Thin Plate Spline) interpolation function. For experiments, we used angiograms of various patients from a coronary angiography in Sanggye Paik Hospital...|$|E

We report our experience with LigaSure(tm) for thyroidectomy to test the hypothesis that it reduces operating time without increasing complications compared with <b>standard</b> <b>vessel</b> ligation. Methods: This non-randomized, retrospective review included 234 consecutive patients who underwent thyroidectomy by one surgeon. <b>Standard</b> <b>vessel</b> ligation was used in 99 patients between 1997 and 2000, and the LigaSure(tm) was used in 135 patients between 2001 and 2003. The following data were collected: patient demographics, thyroid pathology, type of operation (total thyroidectomy vs lobectomy), operating time, complications (transient or permanent hypocalcaemia, ! 8 mg/dL), recurrent or superior laryngeal nerve injury, neck haematoma, wound complications, prolonged intubation), incision length and hospital stay. Results: The two groups had similar demographics, thyroid pathology, types of operations and complication rates. The LigaSure(tm) group had lower operating times and incision lengths. Conclusion: We found that the LigaSure(tm) was as safe as <b>standard</b> <b>vessel</b> ligation for thyroidectomy, with the benefit of reduced operating time.

40|$|In {{this study}} {{a model of}} acute {{oxidative}} stress was used to investigate the effects of ROS on the vascular integrity. We tested the hypothesis that oxidative stress via p 38 -MAPK signaling pathways increases the contractility of vascular smooth muscle cells and that the effect is age dependent. The properties of mesenteric arteries from C 57 /BL 6 and MK 2 -knockout mice were studied under isometric conditions in a <b>standard</b> <b>vessel</b> myograph. Vessel rings of juvenile (60 d) and adult (160 d) animals were used. NADPH-treatment increases the Ang II-induced contraction in adult blood vessels via the p 38 /MK 2 -MAPK pathway. The effect is independent of NO, the vessels showed no reduction in NO bioavailability.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Intracranial in-stent {{hyperplasia}} is a stroke-associated complication {{that requires}} routine surveillance. OBJECTIVE: To compare {{the results of}} in vivo experiments to determine the accuracy and precision of in-stent hyperplasia measurements obtained with modified C-arm contrast-enhanced, cone-beam CT (CE-CBCT) imaging with those obtained by 2 ̆ 7 gold standard 2 ̆ 7 histomorphometry. Additionally, to carry out clinical analyses comparing this CE-CBCT protocol with digital subtraction angiography (DSA). METHODS: A non-binned CE-CBCT protocol (VasoCT) was used that acquires x-ray images with a small field-of-view and applies a full-scale reconstruction algorithm providing high-resolution three-dimensional (3 D) imaging with 100 microm isotropic voxels. In an vivo porcine model, VasoCT cross-sectional area measurements were compared with gold <b>standard</b> <b>vessel</b> histology. VasoCT and DSA were used to calculate in-stent stenosis in 23 imaging studies. RESULTS: Porcine VasoCT cross-sectional stent, lumen, and in-stent hyperplasia areas strongly correlated with histological measurements (r(2) = 0. 97, 0. 93, 0. 90; slope= 1. 14, 1. 07, and 0. 76, respectively; p 3 ̆c 0. 0001).

40|$|International audienceGrains were key {{products}} for the working of the bureaucracy in early Imperial China. This chapter is devoted to some methods used {{at the time to}} assess the value of a given amount of grain and, more importantly, to determine equivalences between different amounts of grains. It can therefore be viewed as a contribution to the description of early practices of determining the value of things. The earliest writing devoted to mathematics and handed down through the written tradition, The Nine Chapters on Mathematical Procedures (ca. first century C. E.), and the commentaries composed on it in the third and the seventh century provide evidence on practices used for such matters. This chapter shows that The Nine Chapters attests to the practice of using, for each kind of grain, a specific <b>standard</b> <b>vessel.</b> Each of these vessels determined the amount corresponding to the unit hu attached to the grain. In other words, to each grain was attached a capacity unit. Even though these units all bore the same name (hu), the corresponding amount of grain varied according to the grain dealt with. In this system, the vessels were designed {{in such a way that}} one hu of any grain, determined by using the vessel attached to the grain in question, would have the same value for any kind of grain, despite the fact the units embodied by each of these vessels would have a different volume. The chapter establishes that this is how actors interpreted this feature of the system, thereby documenting actors’ perception of practices to determine the value of grains. In this first way of determining equivalences between grains, material artifacts played a key part. The expression of the value in terms of a number and a measure unit, the name of which is the same, but the value of which depends on the thing measured, requires our attention. In addition, The Nine Chapters also attests to the elaboration of a mathematical method designed to carry out the same function, that is, determining equi-valent amounts of distinct types of grain. The method relied on a mathematical procedure. It further required the shaping of a table of numbers. The numbers gathered in the table were referred to by means of a concept specific to the mathematics from early China. A newly discovered mathematical manuscript sheds light on aspects of the history of the mathematical method. In particular, the unit hu is used in a completely different way within this second framework. In conclusion, the chapter evidences how practitioners of mathematics took part in, and understood the problems attached to, determining the value of amounts of grain...|$|E
