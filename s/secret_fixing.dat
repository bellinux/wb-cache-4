40|$|Radio-frequency {{identification}} (RFID, for short) {{is regarded}} as a fundamental technology for ubiquitous services and thus a growing security and privacy concern goes along with its applications integrated into everyday life, often in an invisible way. The possible abuse of RFID’s tracking capability raises threats to user privacy. It has inspired lot of research interest, but many measures bring about a very challenging risk, that is, synchronization. Failure to keep changes of the shared secret in step between the tag and the back-end server will cause RFID system out of action. This paper presents an effective privacy-preserving protocol by means of commutative cipher to obviate the possibility of the mistake. In the proposed scheme, the tag output associated to the <b>fixed</b> <b>secret</b> identifier is dynamic at every session to conduct mutual authentication with reader-to-tag and tag-to-reader in turn. Therefore, our work is robust against desynchronization attacks and other security attacks, such as cloned use and man-in-the-middle attack, as well. Key words...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present several {{weaknesses}} in the key scheduling algorithm of RC 4, and describe their cryptanalytic significance. We identify {{a large number of}} weak keys, in which knowledge of a small number of key bits suffices to determine many state and output bits with non-negligible probability. We use these weak keys to construct new distinguishers for RC 4, and to mount related key attacks with practical complexities. Finally, we show that RC 4 is completely insecure in a common mode of operation which is used in the widely deployed Wired Equivalent Privacy protocol (WEP, {{which is part of the}} 802. 11 standard), in which a <b>fixed</b> <b>secret</b> key is concatenated with known IV modifiers in order to encrypt different messages. Our new passive ciphertext-only attack on this mode can recover an arbitrarily long key in a negligible amount of time which grows only linearly with its size, both for 24 and 128 bit IV modifiers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. To be {{resistant}} against certain time-memory-data-tradeoff (TMDTO) attacks, {{a common}} {{rule of thumb}} says that the internal state size of a stream cipher {{should be at least}} twice the security parameter. As memory gates are usually the most area and power consuming compo-nents, this implies a sever limitation with respect to possible lightweight implementations. In this work, we revisit this rule. We argue that a simple shift in the established design paradigm, namely to involve the <b>fixed</b> <b>secret</b> key not only in the initialization process but in the keystream generation phase as well, enables stream ciphers with smaller area size for two reasons. First, it improves the resistance against the mentioned TMDTO attacks which allows to choose smaller state sizes. Second, one can make use of the fact that storing a fixed value (here: the key) requires less area size than realizing a register of the same length. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by describing and implementing a concrete stream cipher Sprout which uses significantly less area than comparable existing lightweight stream ciphers...|$|R
40|$|Secure group {{communications}} {{are increasingly}} {{used in the}} continuous growth of the Internet applications. In a secure multicast environment, an, identical data can be efficiently delivered from a source to multiple receivers within a dynamic group. A simple solution is to encrypt the transmitted data using a symmetric key. However, scalable group rekeying is the main challenge for large and dynamic groups. The key tree-based scheme is widely used to achieve logarithmic computational and transmitted costs in the rekeying process. Nevertheless, the key tree-based schemes use the <b>fixed</b> <b>secret</b> key to encrypt confidential messages until every membership changes, which is lack of security in protecting the high-value content. On the other hand, the key tree-based scheme may result in difficult problems in maintaining synchronization due to the interdependencies among rekeying messages. In this paper, we shall propose a key management scheme based on the secret sharing, in which. we apply a new lightweight prepositioned secret sharing tree-based scheme {{to solve the problem}} in the key tree-based scheme. Furthermore, we eliminate the encryption/decryption processes during every membership and periodic key changes which can dynamically change the secret key frequently...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. It has {{recently}} been reported that the performance of hyperelliptic curve cryptosystems (HECC) is competitive to that of elliptic curve cryptosystems (ECC). However, {{it is expected that}} HECC still can be improved due to their mathematically rich structure. We consider here the application of degenerate divisors of HECC to scalar multiplication. We investigate the operations of the degenerate divisors in the Harley algorithm and the Cantor algorithm of genus 2. The timings of these operations are reported. We then present a novel efficient scalar multiplication method using the degenerate divisors. This method is applicable to cryptosystems with fixed base point, e. g., ElGamal-type encryption, sender of Diffie-Hellman, and DSA. Using a Xeon processor, we found that the double-and-add-always method using the degenerate base point can achieve about a 20 % increase in speed for a 160 -bit HECC. However, we mounted an timing attack using the time difference to designate the degenerate divisors. The attack assumes that the <b>secret</b> key is <b>fixed</b> and the base point can be freely chosen by the attacker. Therefore, the attack is applicable to ElGamal-type decryption and single-pass Diffie-Hellman — SSL using a hyperelliptic curve could be vulnerable to the proposed attack.

40|$|Investigation due to {{increasing}} security threats & attacks with increasing volume of Information traffic. In literature huge studies are made but {{all with a}} <b>fixed</b> <b>secret</b> key, but variable encryption scheme and key transport protocol. Hardly any research has attempted {{to address the issue}} of time variant key, where the secret key will vary from session to session. Shannon documented the theory of perfect secrecy with time variant key. An idea of time variant key in name of Automatic Variable Key has been recently introduced [3 - 5]. This paper deals with the efficient transmission of data from source to destination dynamically based on optimum path selection in certain distributed models[6]. The concept behind this security enhancement is that a shared secret key is agreed upon for a session. In order to solve key distribution problem, use of quantum channel[7] for sending information about key is being explored. A single photon can represent a bit 0 or 1. The phase or state of polarization of the photon may be used for identifying the 0 or 1. In this paper it has been shown that security enhancement through quantum channels can be ensured by varying the key, that is, changing the phase using non-orthogonal measurement bases It has also been shown how AVK can be applied in Vernum Cipher. This paper also points out application of AVK (Automatic Variable Key) in curves[8, 9], AES[10], RSA[11, 12], diffusion and message digest [13]and it is shown that it increases security level during transmission.

40|$|Despite {{the variety}} of tools and {{techniques}} deployed {{in order to protect}} sensitive data, ranging from security types in programming languages to anonymity protocols, data sanitisation, cryptographic algorithms,..., real-world systems tend to disclose part of the information they are meant to protect. This happens either by design - when the output of the system is public (e. g. a password checker) - or for reasons depending on their actual deployment and implementation (e. g. side-channel attacks against cryptographic devices). Our work aims to study methods for analysing from a quantitative point of view the behaviour of information flow in computing systems, that is, the leakage of sensible information via public outputs. In general, we are interested in studying systems with a probabilistic behaviour, in situations where the attacker is allowed to run these systems several times, while the <b>secret</b> is kept <b>fixed.</b> We analyse quantitative information flow in various scenarios characterised by an increasing power of the adversary. We start from the case of a single, passive attacker, attempting to break the system solely based upon observed data. Then we examine more complex settings, where we are faced with adversaries that collect sequential observations, up to considering active adversaries, capable of directly interacting with the system. In all cases, we consider one-try re-execution attacks, where the adversary can make a single guess after observing a certain number of independent executions of the system. In particular, we define suitable security metrics and study their asymptotic behaviour as the number of observations increases, as well as their rate of convergence. We also consider a number of applications of our analysis techniques...|$|R
