Both HPS and MV lamps require a transformer or ballast to change the voltage and regulate the current, however, HPS lamps also require an electrical [...] "starter" [...] circuit—much like older fluorescent lamps in residential use. MV lamps do not require a separate [...] "starter" [...] circuit {{because they have a}} special starter element within the bulb used for <b>striking</b> <b>the</b> <b>arc.</b> MV lamps slowly dim over time, and a 20-year-old lamp may emit a very pleasing, but useless, soft green glow, rather than the powerful blue-white light of a new MV lamp. The yellow-spectrum HPS lamps also slowly dim over time but are known for [...] "cycling," [...] where the lamp cycles on and off when it has reached the end of its life cycle. When cycling, the arc within the lamp extinguishes and the lamp must cool down before the starter circuit initializes a new arc. This has been the most recognized downfall of HPS. Some HPS lamps start to burn a pinkish/reddish color {{at the end of their}} life (usually when already cycling), or start to burn a pinkish/white color and go dim, or also burn out at the end of their life cycle whether they cycle or not. HPS fixtures can contain a special photocell or ballast that can sense a cycling lamp and shut off the fixture to prevent damage to the ignitor and ballast.|$|E

40|$|Summary. This paper {{reports a}} {{detailed}} re-examination of the spatial distribu-tion of shallow- and intermediate-depth earthquakes located beneath Peru between latitudes 3 " and 18 "s.

The more accurately located events that occurred beneath central and northern Peru clearly define a shallow-dipping (about 10 ") inclined seismic zone that extends inland for a distance of about 700 km from the Peru trench.

40|$|SUMMARY: In {{northern}} New Guinea {{there is}} {{clear evidence that}} at some stage in the Neogene the northern margin of the Australian continent was in collision with a southwards facing island arc. There is still active volcanism along the whole length of this arc and a deep oceanic trench opposite the segment E of the collision zone. The Finisterre Range, a part of <b>the</b> former frontal <b>arc</b> and now part of northern New Guinea, lies up to 50 km S of its expected position {{with respect to the}} segments to E and W. Geological and geophysical evidence combine to suggest that this offset is not a deep seated feature, but is the result of movement on a very shallow thrust. Detachment of the thrust sheet from the remainder of the upper crust evidently took place along the line of weakness represented by <b>the</b> volcanic <b>arc.</b> <b>The</b> mobile segment may have been the part of <b>the</b> frontal <b>arc</b> that first collided with the continental margin; the adjacent segments, which were probably, at the time of collision, opposite largely oceanic, and therefore much deeper, trenches, have not moved in this way.

40|$|Anisotropy is {{a common}} {{property}} of the Earth's crust and the upper mantle; it {{is related to the}} strain field of the medium and therefore to geodynamics. In this paper we describe the different possible origins of anisotropic behavior of the seismic waves and the seismological techniques used to define anisotropic bodies. In general it is found that the fast polarization direction is parallel to the absolute plate motion in cratonic areas, to the spreading direction near rifts or extensional zones, and to the main structural features in transpressive regimes. The delay times between fast and slow waves reflect the relative strength and penetration at depth of the deformation field. The correspondence between surface structural trends and anisotropy in the upper mantle, found in many regions of the world, strongly suggest that orogenic processes involve not only the shallow crust but the entire lithosphere. Recently in Italy both shear wave splitting analysis and Pn inversion were applied to define the trend of seismic anisotropy.

500|$|To <b>strike</b> <b>the</b> {{electric}} <b>arc,</b> <b>the</b> electrode {{is brought}} {{into contact with the}} workpiece by a very light touch with the electrode to the base metal then is pulled back slightly. This initiates <b>the</b> <b>arc</b> and thus <b>the</b> melting of the workpiece and the consumable electrode, and causes droplets of the electrode to be passed from the electrode to <b>the</b> weld pool. <b>Striking</b> an arc, which varies widely based upon electrode and workpiece composition, can be the hardest skill for beginners. The orientation of the electrode to workpiece is where most stumble, if the electrode is held at a perpendicular angle to the workpiece the tip will likely stick to the metal which will fuse the electrode to the workpiece which will cause it to heat up very rapidly. The tip of the electrode needs to be at a lower angle to the workpiece, which allows the weld pool to flow out of <b>the</b> <b>arc.</b> [...] As <b>the</b> electrode melts, the flux covering disintegrates, giving off shielding gases that protect the weld area from oxygen and other atmospheric gases. In addition, the flux provides molten slag which covers the filler metal as it travels from the electrode to the weld pool. Once part of the weld pool, the slag floats to the surface and protects the weld from contamination as it solidifies. Once hardened, it must be chipped away to reveal the finished weld. As welding progresses and the electrode melts, the welder must periodically stop welding to remove the remaining electrode stub and insert a new electrode into the electrode holder. This activity, combined with chipping away the slag, reduces {{the amount of time that}} the welder can spend laying the weld, making SMAW one of the least efficient welding processes. In general, the operator factor, or the percentage of operator's time spent laying weld, is approximately 25%.|$|R

The thrust event ruptured about 200 km along <b>strike</b> of <b>the</b> <b>arc</b> and immediately activated normal faulting activity in the trench slope which decayed slowly over time until the great 2007 Kuril intraplate event occurred, radiating with strong short-period seismic wave energy. While {{the moment of the}} 2007 event was about 50 % that of the 2006 event and the far-field tsunami was correspondingly smaller, the 2007 event produced stronger shaking in Japan due to having higher moment-scaled energy release (Ammon et al., 2008). While the 37 -year time separation between the Sanriku events in 1896 and 1933 is substantial, the Kuril doublet was separated by only about 60 days. A much smaller pair of thrust (Mw 7.2, 16 August 2005) and outer rise normal (Mw 7.0, 14 November 2005) events ruptured in the region of interest here, separated by 90 days (Hino et al., 2009).

Magmatic activity was still ongoing during and after the granulitisation as testified by emplacement of a diorite and a gabbro dated at 89. 1 +/- 0. 6 and 88. 2 +/- 0. 9 Ma respectively. The upper part of the metaplutonic sequence contains diorite samples dated at 84. 6 +/- 0. 5 Ma and 84. 3 +/- 0. 5 Ma and as young as 81. 1 +/- 0. 7 Ma.

Seismic studies suggest that the Okinawa Trough is still at a stage of continental rifting prior to leading to seafloor spreading (Sibuet et al. 1998; Nakahigashi et al. 2004; Arai et al. 2017 a). The global model of present-day plate motions predicts that the back-arc rifting along the northern Okinawa Trough occurs in the roughly east–west direction with a relatively slow rate of 22  mm/year (Argus et al. 2011), but former studies based on seismic fault mapping and shallow earthquakes suggest that the stress field there is more heterogeneous in space: Seismic reflection data reveal that the syn-rift normal fault system in the Okinawa Trough exhibits left-stepping en echelon structure, which probably reflects the along-trough variation in rifting rate and/or the oblique rifting direction with respect to <b>the</b> regional <b>strikes</b> of <b>the</b> <b>arc</b> and back-arc (Letouzey and Kimura 1985; Sibuet et al. 1998).
