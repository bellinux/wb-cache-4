25|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Franco-Prussian War abruptly interrupted her theatrical career. The news of {{the defeat of the}} French Army, the surrender of Napoleon III at Sedan, and the proclamation of the Third French Republic on 4 September 1870 was followed by a siege of the city by the Prussian Army. Paris was cut off from news and from its food supply, and the theaters were closed. Bernhardt took charge of converting the Odéon into a hospital for soldiers wounded in the battles outside the city. She organized the placement of 32 beds in the lobby and the foyers, brought in her personal chef to prepare <b>soup</b> <b>for</b> the patients, and persuaded her wealthy friends and admirers to donate supplies for the hospital. Besides organizing the hospital, she worked as a nurse, assisting the chief surgeon with amputations and operations. When the coal supply of the city ran out, Bernhardt used old scenery, benches, and stage props for fuel to heat the theater. In early January 1871, after 16 weeks of the siege, the Germans began to bombard the city with long-range cannons. The patients had to be moved to the cellar, and before long, the hospital was forced to close. Bernhardt arranged for serious cases to be transferred to another military hospital, and she rented an apartment on rue de Provence to house the remaining 20 patients. By the end of the siege, Bernhardt's hospital had cared for more than 150 wounded soldiers, including a young undergraduate from the École Polytechnique, Ferdinand Foch, who later commanded the Allied armies in the First World War.|$|E

The recipe would become the only entry in her Book of Household Management that was her own. After two years of miscarriages, the couple's second son was born in June 1859; he was also named Samuel Orchart Beeton. Hughes sees the miscarriages as further evidence of Samuel's syphilis.|$|E
500|$|Despite these failings, Strom was {{recognized}} as possessing a number of virtues: he was kind, considerate, and honest. Most of all, he was humble: he had not sought the party leadership and notoriously asked after being repeatedly addressed as [...] "Premier" [...] at his first cabinet meeting why it could not [...] "just be plain 'Harry' anymore". When travelling to Ottawa, he stayed at the un-posh Skyline Hotel and ate meals in its basement cafeteria, where he ordered bread and pea <b>soup</b> <b>for</b> $0.25. [...] On final analysis, Barr concludes that this temperament, commendable though it may be, was unsuited to running the government of an emerging economic powerhouse.|$|E

It was published in her own name, and contains various practical advice on efficient household management; cooking, cleaning, washing, brewing, butchering, etc. Rückerschöld {{was influenced by the}} mercantilistic economic ideas of her time, and advised readers to take better advantage of local produce, such as berries and mushrooms and using locally available products in favor of imports, such as substitution of wine with juice or vinegar made from homegrown fruit. There are few actual recipes for cooking, and all of them describe more everyday dishes such as simpler porridge and <b>soup.</b> <b>For</b> more refined cooking, Rückerschöld recommended other contemporary cookbooks, of which Cajsa Warg's is described as the foremost.|$|E

500|$|On July 13, 2009, Tori Amos {{covered the}} song live during her Sinful Attraction Tour at the Paramount Theatre in Oakland, California. On October 15, 2009, Kris Allen covered the {{song for the}} first time at a concert in Seton High School in Cincinnati, Ohio. His {{rendition}} received positive reviews. The song is heard, prominently but briefly, during the climactic fight-scene in the 2005 animated film Robots. Fender, while wearing a skirt, was busy fighting to the beat of the song. An excerpt was used in the comedy film, but was not included on the soundtrack album. Swedish humorist heavy metal band Black Ingvars covered the song for their 2000 album Kids Superhits. The same year, British death metal cover band Ten Masked Men included a rendition of the song on their Return of the Ten Masked Men album. A cover by Ahmet and Dweezil Zappa was featured in the soundtrack of the 2000 film Ready to Rumble. In 2003, the song was covered by American pop punk band Bowling for <b>Soup</b> <b>for</b> the soundtrack of the remake film Freaky Friday and commented that their version was [...] "really, really, dark and really rock, [...] not the kind of 'pop'-py stuff that we usually do." [...] In 2005, power pop band Fountains of Wayne covered the song for their compilation album Out-of-State Plates. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice highlighted their rendition saying the song is [...] "as redolent and fetching as any of 's peaks".

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} a mixed response from television critics. IGN contributor Robert Canning said [...] "Flu Shot" [...] {{had a number of}} aspects that he enjoyed, but [...] "as a whole" [...] the episode was not completely satisfying, and reasoned that this episode fell below 30 Rock standards. He said that he personally did not buy the idea of Liz taking a tropical vacation, [...] "hat's just not the Liz I know. But even ignoring this, the bits involved, especially the flashes to Liz on the beach, weren't all that inspired." [...] Canning also was critical of Jack and Elisa's story as he felt it was weak. Overall, he rated the episode a 7.6 out of 10. Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad wrote, [...] "Is it just me or was this one of the more lacking episodes of 30 Rock? It's not that it was terrible... but this one just seemed to meander. It wasn't as funny as other episodes... and that whole crew-as-zombies-with-the-flu stuff was a little bit too surreal, even for this show." [...] Further in his review, Sassone wrote that the Tracy and Jenna subplot started funny, but ended [...] "in a lame, predictable manner." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger, also disliked [...] "Flu Shot", opining that it was a disappointment. Sepinwall further added that the Jack and Elisa story [...] "felt {{like something out of a}} bad '80s sitcom – and not even the 30 Rock take on a bad '80s sitcom episode." [...] Sepinwall, however, wrote that the episode did have a good moment with Kenneth suggesting to Tracy that he and Jenna get <b>soup</b> <b>for</b> the sick crew themselves, and with Tracy replying [...] "With what? My arms?".|$|E
