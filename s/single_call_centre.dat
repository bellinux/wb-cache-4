The research method was non-participant observation over a seven-month period coupled with ten interviews with key personnel. Findings - It was found that the organisation was able to offset the costs of training and recruitment through internal transfers within the larger organisation. Research limitations/implications - It is a single site study, hence, while of substantial depth the findings are not generalisable. More broad based research is required in the area.

40|$|Emergency {{services}} <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> rely on rapid {{call processing}} time {{to provide assistance}} to the community. The role of the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> is to gain sufficient and accurate information {{in a timely manner}} to pass to the despatch operators to facilitate such a response. In this paper we model the operation and performance of an emergency services <b>call</b> <b>centre.</b> Like all organisations, emergency services have limits to their budget and staffing. <b>Call</b> <b>centre</b> staff costs can be a significant proportion of the centre’s operating budget. So we focus on performance of the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> through staff allocation and performance. We use the New South Wales Police Assistance Line (NSWPAL) as a case study for the emergency services segment of the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> industry. This facility takes both urgent- and nonurgent calls from the community in different queues, each of which has a different service performance level objective. There are a number of metrics used to measure a <b>call</b> <b>centre’s</b> performance and many of these are related directly to the performance of those taking the calls. Overall, these individual performances emerge to metric such as the average speed of answer (ASA) and the service level. It is the latter which we model. Previously we created an agent based model of a <b>single</b> queue <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> [1]. In this paper we introduce a more complex model {{in the form of a}} single queue, multi-server model in which the individual processes and components of a call are modelled. Our model has an agent that manages the generation, allocation and recording of the calls and agents, Customer Service Representatives (CSR) to handle the calls, the call queue and the calls. The CSRs do not communicate with each other during the call taking process and are not directly involved in the staff allocation process. At this stage of modelling, all CSRs have the same performance characteristics and calls arrive at regular time intervals. Our results show the level of sensitivity of service level as the various times of a call’s components are varied and that different methods of calculating the service level can lead to inconsistent results...|$|R

It is also evident that even though mothers are making a significant contribution to the workforce, the role of the working mother is still that of primary caregiver and nurturer in the home. The main {{purpose of this study was}} to examine and compare the psychological well-being of single and married mothers, who do and do not work shifts in a <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> environment. The study findings were based on quantitative research in a <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> in the Western Cape, South Africa, with a sample of 192 single and married working mothers, of whom 135 mothers worked shifts and 57 mothers did not. Psychological well-being was indicated by the use of two instruments: Rosenberg‟s(1965) Self-esteem Scale and Diener‟s (1982) Satisfaction with Life Scale. The data was analysed using the Statistical Package in the Social Sciences (SPSS version 20). The analysis of the data included the use of descriptive and inferential statistics. Findings of the study show that marital status has a significant effect on the psychological well-being of working mothers in this <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> environment.

40|$|Abstract: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the management of <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> productivity by identifying the factors that contribute to lack of knowledge and low productivity levels in a service <b>call</b> <b>centre.</b> This research investigated measures that are required to manage productivity, factors that affect <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> productivity, as well as the knowledge required to manage productivity in a service <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> effectively. In-depth case study research was conducted through document analysis and a questionnaire process, in order to gain insight into how lack of knowledge can affect the management of <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> productivity. The document analysis was done on operations reports from January 2011 to October 2015. The questionnaire results are a summary of 19 service <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> staff working for the same organisation representing agents, team leaders and managers. The results from the document analysis suggest that only 50 % of the current <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> productivity management processes are similar to those recommended in the literature. The questionnaire results suggest that there is a knowledge gap across all staff in the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> when it comes to knowledge required to manage productivity efficiently. The results show that 55 % of the agents and 54 % of the team leaders require training on <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> knowledge and processes that improve <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> productivity. The combined results from both the document analysis and the questionnaire show that <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> staff do not have enough knowledge to improve current <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> productivity. Training is recommended as the solution to the knowledge gap identified. The two types of training that are recommended for <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> staff is formal <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> qualification training, as well as on-the-job training i. e. job mentorship and job rotation for all <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> staff.

40|$|Teams are an {{enduring}} feature of <b>call</b> <b>centres.</b> The literature highlights {{the multitude of}} different tasks performed by teams in the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> context.

40|$|Employment in the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> {{sector in}} the Netherlands, similar to the trend in other European countries, is {{expanding}} greatly. In 2001, Datamonitor (2002) estimated that 1, 266 <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> were operating in the Netherlands. This number {{is expected to have}} risen to roughly 2, 000 in 2006. An estimated 188, 000 people work in this sector at the moment, representing 2. 5 % of the entire working population in the Netherlands. This represents the highest percentage in Europe with the exception of Ireland. The <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> workforce is employed by in-house and subcontractor <b>call</b> <b>centres.</b> In-house <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> are part of the firm for which they handle customer contacts, whereas subcontractor <b>call</b> <b>centres,</b> which provide customer contact services for other firms or institutions. The <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> sector features a large number of employees working in so-called atypical employment contracts, in particular ‘agents’ who handle the actual customer contacts (De Grip, Hoevenberg & Willems, 1997). Agents are often hired into temporary appointments, part-time contracts, irregular shifts, stand-by contracts, et cetera. The use of such atypical contracts is closely related to the great need for flexibility in the deployment of staff (Kalleberg, 2000). Such workforce flexibility is necessary in order to negotiate peaks and valleys in call volumes. In addition, many <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> prioritize on cost reduction, and this approach constrains investment in personnel. <b>Call</b> <b>centres</b> are therefore often classified as ‘electronic sweatshops’ offering only ‘dead-end jobs’ (Taylor, et al., 2002; Deery & Kinnie, 2004). The labour market for <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> agents could thus be characterised as a ‘secondary labour market’ of insecure, poorly paid jobs without any career opportunities (see e. g. Dekker, De Grip & Heijke, 2002). However, the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> sector is heterogeneous with respect to employment conditions. For example, agents who work in in-house <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> have better employment conditions than their counterparts in subcontractor <b>call</b> <b>centres.</b> The Dutch industrial relations system offers one explanation for this difference. Agents working in in-house <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> have protections defined by the collective labour agreement (CLA) of the firm the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> agents work in. In contrast, the subcontractor <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> did not have any comparable protections or their own CLA until 2003. The establishment of a CLA that covers agents employed in Dutch subcontractor <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> in 2003 is a unique phenomenon in the European <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> market (Roland, 2000 b). The difference in working conditions between in-house and subcontractor <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> raises the following research question addressed in this paper: To what extent is the labour market for <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> agents a dual labour market, with a secondary segment in the subcontractor <b>call</b> <b>centres,</b> and a primary segment {{in the form of a}} ‘professional labour market’ in the in-house call centres?To answer this question, we analyze survey data collected from a national survey of <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> managers in the Netherlands. Moreover, we investigate whether the aforementioned need for workforce flexibility may provide an explanation for the labour market segmentation in the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> sector and if this segmentation is embedded in Dutch industrial relations. We begin with a brief overview of labour market segmentation theory. Next, we describe the dataset, and provide some brief background about the Dutch <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> sector and its workforce. Then, we investigate the differences between employment conditions in in-house and subcontractor <b>call</b> <b>centres,</b> to determine whether there is a segmented labour markets. Finally, we assess the influence of industrial relations in the <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> sector, and determine whether these reflect the labour market segmentation. education, training and the labour market;...|$|R

Early <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> were seen as cost centres and operated in a similar manner, often resulting in poor and unsatisfactory performance. Modern <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> are being approached in a different way. They are aligned with the strategic objectives of the organisation and are seen as performance centres and revenue drivers. Modern <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> are dynamic and complex organisations, both technologically and operationally. Performance objectives are often conflicting and controlling parameters have to be finely balanced in a volatile environment. It is therefore imperative to utilise <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> effectively and efficiently. This can only be achieved by a structured and scientific operations research based approach. The research was initiated by the requirement of a <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> design and implementation as part of a larger business process reengineering project.

The only required equipment is Internet access and a workstation. The companies are preferring Virtual <b>Call</b> <b>Centre</b> services due to cost advantage. Companies can start their <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> business immediately without installing the basic infrastructure like Dialer, ACD and IVRS.|$|R

As <b>Call</b> <b>centres</b> grow and become more complex in their function and organisation so do the knowledge infrastructures required to support their size and complexity. This study suggests a knowledge-based hierarchy of ‘advice-type’ <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> and discusses associated knowledge management strategies for different sized centres. It introduces a Knowledge Infrastructure Hierarchy model, with which {{it is possible to}} analyze and classify <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> knowledge infrastructures. The model also demonstrates different types of interventions supporting knowledge management in <b>call</b> <b>centres.</b> Finally the paper discusses the possibilities of applying traditional maturity model approaches in this context...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Call</b> <b>centres</b> {{can improve}} the {{effectiveness}} of health services by helping reduce access barriers associated with stigma and geography. This project aimed to develop and pilot a standardised evaluation framework to assess Marie Stopes International reproductive health <b>call</b> <b>centres.</b> Methods: Consultations were held with staff from the 14 existing international <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> to gauge current monitoring and evaluation processes, identify gaps, and establish evaluation needs. The draft framework was then piloted in the Marie Stopes Mexico <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> using client and provider surveys, mystery callers and a review of <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> records. Results: A flexible framework was developed to allow <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> to measure the effectiveness of services offered. Nineteen indicators were developed to assess access, equity, quality and efficiency. The pilot found pre-defined ranges for indicators of access were not appropriate for a high-functioning <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> that was already achieving nearly 100 % compliance. Several indicators could not be measured {{due to a lack}} of routine data collection systems. Conclusions: A standardised evaluation framework will allow comparisons over time and between <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> in different countries. Future assessments could be improved by establishing routine, reliable data collection systems prior to framework implementation. This is one of the first attempts to standardise the evaluation of a reproductive health <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> and establishes a method by which they can be monitored, and thus improved, over time...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{contribute}} to the developing literature on <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> by providing detailed empirical evidence on the spatial unevenness {{in the distribution of}} <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> activity. They argue that the driving forces of <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> growth, whether as the rationalisation of back-office functions or as entirely new entities, have been corporate strategy and the pursuit of low-cost competitive advantage. Thus, although technological developments at the heart of <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> operations render them relatively 'footloose' in locational terms, the search for specific characteristics makes certain regions (and parts of regions) more attractive than others. By using a sample database of <b>call</b> <b>centres,</b> the authors describe the characteristics of <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> in the United Kingdom in terms of size, sector, and spatial distribution. They then attempt to explain the determinants of <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> location at the county level through a multiple regression analysis. The results indicate that there is a propensity to site <b>call</b> <b>centres</b> close to existing concentrations of allied activity, with preferences for densely populated areas mediated by needs to maintain employee access and avoid staff turnover problems. This has important implications for the spatial division of labour, with <b>call</b> <b>centre</b> growth likely to reinforce existing spatial unevenness in employment in key service activities. The authors conclude by considering the implications of these findings for contemporary urban and regional development, as well as providing a number of suggestions for future research. ...|$|R
