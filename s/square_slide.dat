40|$|We {{describe}} a numerical method to compute Casimir forces in arbitrary geometries, for arbitrary dielectric and metallic materials, with arbitrary accuracy (given sufficient computational resources). Our approach, based on well-established {{integration of the}} mean stress tensor evaluated via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem, is designed to directly exploit fast methods developed for classical computational electromagnetism, since it only involves repeated evaluation of the Green's function for imaginary frequencies (equivalently, real frequencies in imaginary time). We develop the approach by systematically examining various formulations of Casimir forces from the previous decades and evaluating them according to their suitability for numerical computation. We illustrate our approach with a simple finite-difference frequency-domain implementation, test it for known geometries such as a cylinder and a plate, {{and apply it to}} new geometries.

30|$|An {{original}} algorithm for {{the detection}} of small objects in a noisy background is proposed. Its application to underwater objects detection by sonar imaging is addressed. This new method is based on the use of higher-order statistics (HOS) that are locally estimated on the images. The proposed algorithm is divided into two steps. In a first step, HOS (skewness and kurtosis) are estimated locally using a <b>square</b> <b>sliding</b> computation window. Small deterministic objects have different statistical properties from the background they are thus highlighted. The influence of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on the results is studied in the case of Gaussian noise. Mathematical expressions of the estimators and of the expected performances are derived and are experimentally confirmed. In a second step, the results are focused by a matched filter using a theoretical model. This enables the precise localization of the regions of interest. The proposed method generalizes to other statistical distributions and we derive the theoretical expressions of the HOS estimators {{in the case of a}} Weibull distribution (both when only noise is present or when a small deterministic object is present within the filtering window). This enables the application of the proposed technique to the processing of synthetic aperture sonar data containing underwater mines whose echoes have to be detected and located. Results on real data sets are presented and quantitatively evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.|$|R

We studied the knot strength and knot security of three knots when simulating a continuous wound closure: the <b>square,</b> the <b>sliding,</b> and a hybrid constructed using a surgeon’s square knot {{followed by a}} sliding knot. Mate-rials and Methods: Knot holding capacity (KHC) of single-strand 1 - 0 polypropylene was determined by slow distraction on a horizontal testing sled of the strand {{that would be used}} to complete a continuous (“running”) closure following placement of an anchoring knot with six throws. Distraction continued until failure of the knot defined as breakage or slippage of the knot. Results: The mean and standard deviation of KHC meas-ured in pounds was determined (n = 30 for each knot) : standard square 8. 94 +/– 1. 04; sliding 10. 72 +/– 1. 35; and hybrid 10. 95 +/– 1. 10. For each knot the relative knot security [(KHC of the knot/Tensile strength of untied strand) x 100] was calculated: standard square 69. 5 %; sliding 83. 4 %; hybrid 85. 2 %. Significant dif-ferences (p < 0. 0001) in KHC exist between <b>square</b> and <b>sliding</b> knots (favoring sliding knots) and between square and hybrid knots (favoring hybrid knots). Hybrid and sliding knots were not statistically different. Conclusion: Sliding knots and hybrid knots are superior to square knots as anchoring knots for single-strand continuous wound closure...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} obtain maximal crop {{productivity}} with minimal environmental pollution, the amount of nutrients applied to the soil should be matched to the site-specific crop needs. In the case of liquid manure application, this means that manure flow must be controlled according to the local soil fertility, the crop needs, the manure composition and the driving speed. Since each of these parameters varies during injection, a fast and accurate flow control system is needed. In vacuum manure tankers, the flow is controlled by opening and closing a manure valve, which is actuated hydraulically While magneto-rheological flow sensors are {{the best choice for}} manure flow measurement, their time delay and lag inhibit fast and stable feedback control with conventional equipment. Therefore, a new control strategy with fast and accurate control of the manure valve in combination with on-line flow gain estimation is presented. Two estimation algorithms have been developed in simulation and validated in practice: recursive least <b>squares</b> and <b>sliding</b> observer. Although the recursive least-squares algorithm performed well, the sliding-mode observer had less overshoot, which resulted in a settling time of about 5 s. Since the desired flow is expected to vary smoothly in practice, it is expected that the performance of this combination of a valve position controller and a sliding-mode observer will be sufficient for precise manure application purposes.

Computational cost of using least squares algorithm could also limits the applicability of this technique in geophysical problems.

40|$|A new {{control scheme}} has been {{presented}} in this thesis. Based on the NonLinear Geometric Approach, the proposed Active Control System represents {{a new way to}} see the reconfigurable controllers for aerospace applications. The presence of the Diagnosis module (providing the estimation of generic signals which, based on the case, can be faults, disturbances or system parameters), mean feature of the depicted Active Control System, is a characteristic shared by three well known control systems: the Active Fault Tolerant Controls, the Indirect Adaptive Controls and the Active Disturbance Rejection Controls. The standard NonLinear Geometric Approach (NLGA) has been accurately investigated and than improved to extend its applicability to more complex models. The standard NLGA procedure has been modified to take account of feasible and estimable sets of unknown signals. Furthermore the application of the Singular Perturbations approximation has led to the solution of Detection and Isolation problems in scenarios too complex to be solved by the standard NLGA. Also the estimation process has been improved, where multiple redundant measuremtent are available, by the introduction of a new algorithm, here called "Least <b>Squares</b> - <b>Sliding</b> Mode". It guarantees optimality, {{in the sense of the}} least squares, and finite estimation time, in the sense of the sliding mode. The Active Control System concept has been formalized in two controller: a nonlinear backstepping controller and a nonlinear composite controller. Particularly interesting is the integration, in the controller design, of the estimations coming from the Diagnosis module. Stability proofs are provided for both the control schemes.
