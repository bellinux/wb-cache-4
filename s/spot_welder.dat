50|$|In the 1930s, the {{invention}} of the <b>spot</b> <b>welder</b> by Watkin allowed a much greater success rate when soldering fine wires, especially, steel. Elliot's of Liverpool produced the welder commercially and promoted it in the instruction manual: ‘The Watkin welder has been designed by an eminent orthodontist essentially for the speedy and efficient welding of stainless steel wire and tape. Weighing only 35lbs, it is completely portable. The Watkin Welder has proved invaluable to other professions, and is used extensively in the engineering, electrical and allied trades.’The Watkin Welder sold widely and it was used by the valve maker Mullard and by leading orthodontists, clinicians and hospitals throughout the world for twenty-five years until an electronic <b>spot</b> <b>welder</b> superseded it. Watkin did become wealthy through its sales but as he did not believe in patents he did not make the great fortune he perhaps deserved. Modern spot welders still have more than a passing resemblance to his original design, especially in the rotating star head section.|$|E

50|$|The basic <b>spot</b> <b>welder</b> {{consists}} of a power supply, an energy storage unit (e.g., a capacitor bank), a switch, a welding transformer, and the welding electrodes. The energy storage element allows the welder to deliver high instantaneous power levels. If the power demands are not high, then the energy storage element isn't needed. The switch causes the stored energy to be dumped into the welding transformer. The welding transformer steps down the voltage and steps up the current. An important feature of the transformer is it reduces the current level that the switch must handle. The welding electrodes {{are part of the}} transformer's secondary circuit. There is also a control box that manages the switch and may monitor the welding electrode voltage or current.|$|E

Currently, spot welding adhesives process or {{also known as}} weld bonding process was the effective solution for improving mechanical properties of metal joining. However, it also created issues in occupational safety and health. Previous study confirmed notably higher airborne contaminants were detected prior to usage of welding adhesive. This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the personal welding fumes exposure and pulmonary function of welders involved in the weld bonding process. Welding fumes analysis revealed out of 15 investigated elements, none were exceeding the threshold limits for both spot and weld bonding processes. Pulmonary function tests (PFT) were conducted by using hand held spirometer to 15 control group, 11 <b>spot</b> <b>welders</b> and 19 weld bonding welders. Result of the study shows a significant mean difference of pulmonary functions values in investigated welder groups. Weld bonding welders had the lowest mean pulmonary functions values compare to other groups. Statistical analysis reveals that the pulmonary function of <b>spot</b> <b>welders</b> were affected significantly by number of smoking years but not significantly affected to duration of exposure. However, weld bonding welders pulmonary functions values were not significantly affected neither by smoking years nor working durations.

5000|$|Gordon Murray the Formula 1 and Mclaren F1 designer, {{said when}} {{designing}} his new Murray T.25 city car:"I discovered why people didn't make {{what they call}} 'Sub A' segment cars, small city cars - you don't make any money on them. Because the tooling and development cost for a small car is almost {{the same as for}} a bigger car. So people would rather build larger cars and make more profit. That's when I started thinking, that {{if this is going to}} work there needs to be a new way of making the cars, that is cost effective. That high capital pressed components using low labour cost countries a long distance from developed world markets has a large environmental cost. Car manufacturers say that production emissions are small compared to tailpipe emissions, but in fact they are a very significant proportion of total emissions. We need to re-think the Henry Ford design of mass production." [...] Murray's solution is a laser cut tubular steel space-frame chassis built with an automated tube mill, braced with bonded low-cost composite sheets that would be a cheaper and greener means of production.

40|$|Resistance {{spot welding}} (RSW) has {{revolutionized}} automotive industries since early 1970 s for its mechanical assemblies. To date one mechanical assembly out five is welded using spot welding technology in various industries {{and stainless steel}} became very popular among common materials. As such this research paper analyses the spot weld growth on 304 austenitic stainless steels with 2 mm sample sheets. The growth of a spot weld is primarily determined by its parameters such as current, weld time, electrode tip and force. However other factors such as electrode deformations, corrosions, dissimilar materials and material properties are also affect the weld growth. This paper is intended to analyze only the effects of nuggets growth due to the current and weld time increment with constant force and unchanged electrode tips.

40|$|Spot welding {{is used in}} the {{automotive}} and aircraft industries, where high-speed, repetitive welding is needed to join thin sections of metal. Epoxy adhesives are applied as sealers to the metal seams. Pulmonary function abnormalities and airway irritation have been reported in <b>spot</b> <b>welders,</b> but no animal toxicology studies exist. Therefore, the goal {{of this study was to}} investigate vascular, immune and lung toxicity measures after exposure to these metal fumes in an animal model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed by inhalation to 2522 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 030 mg/m 23 to either mild-steel spot welding aerosols with sparking (high metal, HM) or without sparking (low metal, LM) for 422 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 030 h/d for 3, 8 and 1322 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 030 d. Shams were exposed to filtered air. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), lung gene expression and ex vivo BAL cell challenge were performed to assess lung toxicity. Lung resistance (R(L)) was evaluated before and after challenge with inhaled methacholine (MCh). Functional assessment of the vascular endothelium in isolated rat tail arteries and leukocyte differentiation in the spleen and lymph nodes via flow cytometry was also done. Immediately after exposure, baseline R(L) was significantly elevated in the LM spot welding aerosols, but returned to control level by 2422 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 030 h postexposure. Airway reactivity to MCh was unaffected. Lung inflammation and cytotoxicity were mild and transient. Lung epithelial permeability was significantly increased after 3 and 822 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 030 d, but not after 1322 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 030 d of exposure to the HM aerosol. HM aerosols also caused vascular endothelial dysfunction and increased CD 4 +, CD 8 + and B cells in the spleen. Only LM aerosols caused increased IL- 6 and MCP- 1 levels compared with sham after ex vivo LPS stimulation in BAL macrophages. Acute inhalation of mild-steel spot welding fumes at occupationally relevant concentrations may act as an irritant as evidenced by the increased R(L) and result in endothelial dysfunction, but otherwise had minor effects on the lung.

40|$|Introduction: Risk {{assessment}} of Toxic or hazardous chemicals enables the Industrial Hygienists {{to make the}} appropriate decision in providing healthy work place. This project was conducted in an assembling plant,(4 workshop) of an Automobile Industry in IRAN with 2 types of welding operations, including GMAW (CO 2 welding) and Spot resistance welding operations.. Method and Materials: Welders` exposures were assessed via collecting 143 breathing zone air samples based on NIOSH 0500 method. Risk assessment was carried out using Singapore recommended method.. Results: Finding showed that the mean of welders exposure in GMAW and Spot resistance welding operations 5. 61 ± 5. 78 and 2. 38 ± 2. 15 mg/m 3, respectively(p< 0. 05). The results showed that in GMAW welders had the highe exposure in comparison with <b>Spot</b> resistance <b>welders</b> (p< 0. 05). The findings also demonstrated that the risk rate of GMAW welders were high, while this rate for Spot resistance was low.. Conclusion: more hygienic attention is needed for GTAW welders.
