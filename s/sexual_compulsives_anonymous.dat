50|$|<b>Sexual</b> <b>Compulsives</b> <b>Anonymous</b> (SCA) is an {{organization}} that describes itself as providing a twelve-step program for recovery from what it terms sexual compulsion. SCA's founding is attributed variously to 1982 in New York City and to 1973 in Los Angeles. Although the fellowship originally sought to address issues of sexual compulsion among gay and bisexual men, and this is still the fellowship's predominate demographic, today the program is LGBT friendly, open to all sexual orientations, and {{an increasing number of}} women and heterosexual men are participating. SCA meetings {{are most likely to be}} held in urban areas with larger gay and bisexual male populations. The majority of members are white, but vary in age and socioeconomic background. The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop having compulsive sex.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{comprehensively}} study love and sexuality on the internet, for example user demographics, usage patterns, and descriptions of the arenas that constitute the sexual landscape on the internet. Instead of using more traditional ways of data collection, quantitative and {{qualitative data were collected}} through the internet. A review of prior research in the field shows that the studies conducted are fragmented, specialized, and clustered around specific topics. In addition, prior studies are predominantly empirical with little connection to social theory. In this thesis, empirical findings are related to both prior research and theory. The theoretical starting points are Bauman and his concept of liquid modernity, Goffman and his dramaturgical perspective, and Gagnon and Simon’s theory of sexual scripts. This thesis consists of four quantitative articles and one qualitative report, each with its own demarcated purpose. The first article examines online sexual activities and how these are influenced by gender and age. Two major dimensions were found among the sexual activities and were labelled “accessing erotica” and “partner seeking”. The results show that men prefer to view online erotica while women prefer to flirt. More men than women use the internet to find partners, to visit dating sites and to reply to sex ads. Women, on the other hand, use the internet to stay in contact with their partners and to seek education/information about sex. Respondents older than 50 years use the internet less for sexual purposes. In the second article, those who dropped out from the online questionnaire are examined. Approximately half of those who start to fill out the questionnaire drop out before completion. Dropouts can be identified by gender, sexual orientation, and internet connection speed. Men, heterosexuals, and those with modem connections tend to drop out earlier than others. The third article focuses on those who engage in cybersex, which is defined as two or more persons engaging in mutual sexual talk while online for sexual pleasure. Approximately one third of both men and women engage in cybersex. A multivariate analysis shows that men over 50 are less likely to engage in cybersex. Furthermore, homosexuals are more likely than heterosexuals to have cybersex. Those who engage in cybersex spend more time online for sexual purposes and have more offline sex partners in comparison to those without this experience. The fourth article examines those who are sexually compulsive according to a 10 -item sexual compulsivity scale. Almost 6 percent are categorized as <b>sexual</b> <b>compulsives.</b> A multivariate analysis shows <b>sexual</b> <b>compulsives</b> more likely to be men than women, to be bisexual rather than heterosexual, and to be in a relationship rather than single. Contrary to prior research, the time spent online seems to indicate the activities they engage in. A bivariate analysis shows <b>sexual</b> <b>compulsives</b> to have consumed pornography before starting to use the internet for sexual purposes and to increase their offline pornography consumption more than non-sexual compulsives. In the qualitative report the sexual landscape, the actors, and the online sexual activities are examined. The report shows that generational differences influence which arenas are used and how they are used. Younger users spend much time online and integrate the internet in their everyday lives of which love and sexuality is part. Older users log on to the internet to engage in activities specifically related to love and sexuality. The results show that online experiences influence the informants’ behaviors offline and vice versa. Finally, this study emphasizes the changing nature of the internet and how this influences arenas and actors which in turn influence behaviors. This thesis emphasizes anonymity as an important aspect for understanding love and sexuality on the internet. In addition, it shows how love and sexuality on the internet can be explained and understood in relation to prior theory...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Compulsive-Impulsive Sexual Behaviors (C-ISBs) include {{repetitive}} <b>sexual</b> {{acts and}} <b>compulsive</b> <b>sexual</b> thoughts which occur so frequently {{and with such}} intensity that they interfere with sexual intimacy and interpersonal and occupational functioning and whose categorization and effective treatments are still unclear.

Topiramate is a powerful anticonvulsant which has recently been proposed also for the treatment of migraine, bipolar disorder and binge eating disorder. This case-report suggests that topiramate might be beneficial in augmentation with citalopram in patients suffering from C-ISBs, although controlled studies to confirm our findings are needed. </p...|$|R
40|$|Neurocognitive {{findings}} in <b>compulsive</b> <b>sexual</b> behavior: A preliminary study Background and aims: <b>Compulsive</b> <b>sexual</b> behavior (CSB) {{is a common}} behavior affecting 3 – 6 % of the population, characterized by repetitive and intrusive sexual urges or behaviors that typically cause negative social and emotional consequences. Methods: For this small pilot study on neurological data, we compared 13 individuals with CSB and gen-der- matched healthy controls on diagnostic assessments and computerized neurocognitive testing. Results: No signifi-cant {{differences were found between}} the groups.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of this}} multicenter, {{case-control study}} was to {{investigate}} the prevalence and severity of impulsive-compulsive behaviors (ICBs) in a cohort of patients with parkin-associated Parkinson disease (PD) compared to a group of patients without the mutation. METHODS: We compared 22 patients with biallelic parkin mutations (parkin-PD) and 26 patients negative for parkin, PINK 1, DJ- 1, and GBA mutations (PD-NM), matched for age at onset, disease duration, levodopa, and dopamine agonist equivalent daily dose. A semistructured interview was used to diagnose each of the following ICBs: <b>compulsive</b> <b>sexual</b> behavior, <b>compulsive</b> buying, binge eating, punding, hobbyism, and compulsive medication use. The Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease-Rating Scale (QUIP-RS) was adopted to rate ICB severity. RESULTS: Frequency of patients with at least one ICB was comparable between parkin-PD and PD-NM. Nevertheless, when analyzing the distribution of specific ICBs, a higher frequency of compulsive shopping, binge eating, and punding/hobbyism was found in the parkin-PD group. Compared to PD-NM, parkin-PD patients with ICB had younger onset age and higher frequency of smokers; in 5 patients, ICB had predated PD onset. Total and partial (<b>compulsive</b> buying, <b>compulsive</b> <b>sexual</b> behavior, binge eating, hobbyism/punding) QUIP-RS scores were higher in patients with parkin-PD compared to patients with PD-NM. Logistic regression analysis showed that the presence of parkin mutations was associated with smoking status and higher QUIP-RS total score. CONCLUSIONS: Our data expand the parkin-associated phenotypic spectrum demonstrating higher frequency and severity of specific ICBs, and suggesting an association between the parkin genotype, smoking status, and ICB severity...|$|R

40|$|Intrafamilial {{child sexual}} abuse {{is one of the}} most diffucult issue to be talked over and studied.

It can lead to both immediate and long-term adverse behavioral and psychological effects that carry over into adulthood. A causal model identifying rehationship among sexual abuse situation characteristics, based on Finkelhor and Brownes traumagenic model of childhood sexual abuse has four traumatic dynamics, including traumatic sexuality with abuse, feeling of betrayal, weakness and stigmatization. Traumatic sexuality can be defined as deviation of the development of sexual feelings and attitudes from normal. The documented long-term effects of childhood sexual abuse on adult functioning include affective disorders, self destructive behaviors, posttraumatic stress disorder and disturbed interpersonal relationships.

5000|$|ΔJunD, a {{transcription}} factor, and G9a, a histone methyltransferase enzyme, both directly {{oppose the}} induction of ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens (i.e., they oppose increases in its expression). Sufficiently overexpressing ΔJunD in the nucleus accumbens with viral vectors can completely block {{many of the}} neural and behavioral alterations seen in chronic drug abuse (i.e., the alterations mediated by ΔFosB). ΔFosB also {{plays an important role}} in regulating behavioral responses to natural rewards, such as palatable food, sex, and exercise. Since both natural rewards and addictive drugs induce expression of ΔFosB (i.e., they cause the brain to produce more of it), chronic acquisition of these rewards can result in a similar pathological state of addiction. ΔFosB is the most significant factor involved in both amphetamine addiction and amphetamine-induced sex addictions, which are <b>compulsive</b> <b>sexual</b> behaviors that result from excessive sexual activity and amphetamine use. [...] These sex addictions (i.e., drug-induced <b>compulsive</b> <b>sexual</b> behaviors) are associated with a dopamine dysregulation syndrome which occurs in some patients taking dopaminergic drugs, such as amphetamine or methamphetamine.|$|R
50|$|Consistent with {{there not}} being any {{consensus}} over what causes hypersexuality, authors have used many different labels {{to refer to}} it, sometimes interchangeably, but often depending on which theory they favor or which specific behavior they were studying.

40|$|An {{influential}} model {{suggests that}} dopamine signals {{the difference between}} predicted and experienced reward. In this way, dopamine {{can act as a}} learning signal that can shape behaviors to maximize rewards and avoid punishments. Dopamine is also thought to invigorate reward seeking behavior. Loss of dopamine signaling is the major abnormality in Parkinson’s disease. Dopamine agonists have been implicated in the occurrence of impulse control disorders in Parkinson’s disease patients, the most common being pathological gambling, <b>compulsive</b> <b>sexual</b> behavior, and <b>compulsive</b> buying. Recently, a number of functional imaging studies investigating impulse control disorders in Parkinson’s disease have been published. Here we review this literature, and attempt to place it within a decision-making framework in which potential gains and losses are evaluated to arrive at optimum choices. We also provide a hypothetical but still incomplete model on the effect of dopamine agonist treatment on these value and risk assessments. Two of the main brain structures thought to be involved in computing aspects of reward and loss are the ventral striatum and the insula, both dopamine projection sites. Both structures are consistently implicated in functional brain imaging studies of pathological gambling in Parkinson’s disease...|$|R
5000|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding sexual addiction is centered around its identification, through a diagnostic model, {{in a clinical}} setting. As noted in current medical literature reviews, <b>compulsive</b> <b>sexual</b> behavior has been observed in humans; drug-induced <b>compulsive</b> <b>sexual</b> behavior has also been noted clinically in some individuals taking dopaminergic drugs. Moreover, current medical research involving neuropsychological models has identified sexual addictions (i.e., the <b>compulsive</b> engagement in <b>sexual</b> behavior despite negative consequences) as a true form of addiction (i.e., it possesses all the necessary characteristics to classify it as one) in animal models. Since current diagnostic models use drug-related concepts as diagnostic criteria for addictions, these are ill-suited for modelling compulsive behaviors in a clinical setting. Consequently, diagnostic classification systems, such as the DSM, do not include sexual addiction as a diagnosis because there is currently [...] "insufficient peer-reviewed evidence to establish the diagnostic criteria and course descriptions needed to identify these behaviors as mental disorders". A 2014 systematic review on sexual addiction indicated that the [...] "lack of empirical evidence on sexual addiction {{is the result of}} the disease's complete absence from versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders." ...|$|R
25|$|Reviews of both {{clinical}} research in humans and preclinical studies involving ΔFosB have identified <b>compulsive</b> <b>sexual</b> activity – specifically, {{any form of}} sexual intercourse – as an addiction (i.e., sexual addiction).
