50|$|Wollastonite has {{industrial}} importance worldwide. It {{is used in}} many industries, {{mostly by}} tile factories which have incorporated it into the manufacturing of ceramic to improve many performance parameters, and {{this is due to}} its fluxing properties, freedom from volatile constituents, whiteness, and acicular particle shape. In ceramics, wollastonite decreases shrinkage and gas evolution during firing, increases green and fired strength, maintains brightness during firing, permits fast firing, and reduces crazing, cracking, and glaze defects. In metallurgical applications, wollastonite serves as a flux for welding, a source for calcium oxide, a slag conditioner, and to protect the surface of molten metal during the continuous casting of steel. As an additive in paint, it improves the durability of the paint film, acts as a pH buffer, improves its resistance to weathering, reduces gloss, reduces pigment consumption, and acts as a flatting and <b>suspending</b> <b>agent.</b> In plastics, wollastonite improves tensile and flexural strength, reduces resin consumption, and improves thermal and dimensional stability at elevated temperatures. Surface treatments are used to improve the adhesion between the wollastonite and the polymers to which it is added. As a substitute for asbestos in floor tiles, friction products, insulating board and panels, paint, plastics, and roofing products, wollastonite is resistant to chemical attack, inert, stable at high temperatures, and improves flexural and tensile strength. In some industries, it is used in different percentages of impurities, such as its use as a fabricator of mineral wool insulation, or as an ornamental building material.|$|E

The suspensions were evaluated for ease of redispersion, sedimentation, rheological properties, {{and the effect of}} aging on the rheological properties at 25 °C. The particle size and particle size distributions of the dispersed solute were determined. The redispersion time was 19, 11, and 0. 5 min, respectively, for formulation containing Na-CMC, HPMC, and GG. The sedimentation volumes were 0. 05, 0. 05, and 0. 125 mL, respectively, for Na-CMC, HPMC, and GG. Viscosities of suspensions at spindle speed of 25 rpm were of the order: GG>HPMC>Na-CMC when freshly prepared and of the order: HPMC>GG>Na-CMC within 6 months of storage. The particles size was 72. 72, 73. 82, 81. 93, and 83. 41 μm, respectively, for suspensions containing Na-CMC, ibuprofen alone, HPMC, and GG.

Place and Duration of Study: Department of Pharmaceutics, Faculty of Pharmacy and Nanotechnology Research Center Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz, Iran. Methodology: To evaluate the effect of structural vehicle, some <b>suspending</b> <b>agents</b> such as carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), tragacanth and magnesium aluminum silicate (Veegum) alone or in combination were utilized.
