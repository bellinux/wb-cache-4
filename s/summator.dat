40|$|In {{this paper}} we solve the problem: how to {{determine}} maximal allowable errors, possible for signals and parameters of each {{element of a}} network proceeding from the condition that the vector of output signals of the network should be calculated with given accuracy? “Back-propagation of accuracy ” is developed to solve this problem. In the present time there are various technical realizations of neural networks, including neural network simulations which are computer models of neural networks. Neural network simulations are flexible means for training of networks and working with them. It is possible to carry out various operations with neural network simulations: to train, to determine the most and the least significant connections, to contrast, i. e. to remove the least significant connections etc. We will consider trained neural network simulation, i. e. for which the values of synapse weights are calculated. Neural network simulation working on digital computer allows to calculate synapse weights with high accuracy, what is difficult to obtain with other technical realizations of network because of their limited accuracy. Therefore there {{is the problem of}} binarization of synapse weights, that is reduction of synapse weights to some set of particular values (for example, 0 or 1 – absence or presence connection between neurons,- 1 or 1 etc.). It is attained by change of the architecture of network – by addition of new synapses, new <b>summators,</b> by creation of cascades of <b>summators</b> etc. On binarization of a network, it is technically difficult to obtain the result with the sam...|$|R

Nevertheless, Skinner (1936, 1953 / 2003) still listed the advantages of such an instrument, considering that projective tests create a laboratory situation, enabling control over stimuli in the observation of behaviour and facilitating the emergence of behaviours that are not known by the subject, especially the verbal ones.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of a rod-detected mask of illuminance IR on the threshold illuminance of a cone-detected test flash (ICth) was assessed while rods were recovering {{from the effects of}} a bleach, and when rods were selectively light adapted. Providing that IR was restricted to within 2 log 10 units of rod mask threshold (IRth), results show that ICth/IC 0 = K (square root (IR/IRth) + D), where IC 0 is cone absolute threshold, D is a dark noise term and K is a proportionality constant. These data were used to obtain 'equivalent background functions' or 'Crawford (1947) transforms' (illuminance of a background field plotted against time in the dark). The same Crawford transform was obtained when either IRth or ICth (in the presence of a fixed illuminance IR) were used as equating variables. All of the foregoing results could be predicted by considering both the {{influence of}} light adaptation on rods (see Fain, 1976) and the model developed by Bauer, Frumkes & Nygaard (1982). Under dark-adapted conditions, 40 ' and 60 ' diameter rod masks of equal illuminance have very similar influences on ICth. When rods are selectively light adapted 60 ' masks have smaller influences on ICth. The foregoing results were used to extend the model developed in the previous paper.

40|$|According to the {{fundamental}} Huygens superposition principle, light beams traveling in a linear medium will pass though one another without mutual disturbance. Indeed, the field of photonics {{is based on the}} premise that controlling light signals with light requires intense laser fields to facilitate beam interactions in nonlinear media, where the superposition principle can be broken. Here we challenge this wisdom and demonstrate that two coherent beams of light of arbitrarily low intensity can interact on a metamaterial layer of nanoscale thickness in such a way that one beam modulates the other. On the basis of this approach we demonstrate that polarization effects due to absorption, anisotropy and chirality affecting an electromagnetic wave propagating through a thin slab of material can be controlled by another wave, and illustrate spectroscopic applications of these phenomena. We also show that that the coherently controlled redistribution of energy in plasmonic metamaterials can deliver various forms of optical switching and demonstrate small-signal amplifier, <b>summator</b> and invertor functions.

SUMMARYThis job is a continuation of our studiesof the fast applications [1] for the Forward Multiplicity Detector in the ALICE experimentat the LHC [2] Two Sector MCPs (about 18 cm 2 area) are mountedon a thin (200) single ceramics boardwith the microelectronics design for multipad readout integrated with a passivesummator [3]. This UHF device provides isochronous analogue summation of thefast components of 1 ns signals from 8 pads along with the individual readout of charges [4]. The setup is assembled together with theceramic plate which integrates multichannel feedthroughsand one cylinder Ti-getter pump specially developed forthis detector. This ceramic plate is welded to the stainless steel vacuum sector chamber. Special Al coating is applied on the inner side of the 200 micronthick chamber walls in order to prevent hydrogen diffusion. The whole setup is baked under 300 C,a getter Ti pump is activated, and then the chamber is hermetically sealed, providing the working vacuum of 10 (- 5) Torr. The separation of the fast and slow signal components which is done by passive summatorallows us to use this detector as the zero level trigger, in pile-up and beam-gas interaction diagnostics and for thedetermination of the collision vertex position along the beam axis [2], [4]. Small area (1 cm 2) prototype detectors were widely used during the initial stages of the technological developments. Vacuum tests were performed: degassing rates were studied for the stainless steel thin wall chamber, Ti getter, MCPs and ceramics board and feedthroughs. UHFstudies confirmed the technological feasibilities of the passive <b>summator</b> and feedtroughs design with the useful frequency range up to 1. 1 GHz.

40|$|A {{review of}} recent {{research}} on the non-medical control of auditory hallucinations is presented. It is suggested that the decreases in hallucinatory behavior obtained in studies using aversive contingencies may be attributable to the disruption of the chains of behavior involved. The results of several additional studies are interpreted as indicating that methods of stimulus control {{and the use of}} incompatible behaviors may be effective in reducing the rate of auditory hallucinations. Research relating auditory hallucinations to subvocalizations is presented in support of the view that hallucinatory phenomena are sometimes related to the subject's own vocal productions. Skinner's views (1934, 1936, 1953, 1957, 1980) are then presented as possible explanations of some hallucinatory behavior. It is suggested that some auditory hallucinations consit of the mishearing of environmental and physiological stimuli as voices in a fashion similar to that which Skinner observed in his work with the verbal <b>summator.</b> The maintenance of long chains of such responses may be largely attributable to self-intraverbal influences (such as are present during automatic writing). With some auditory hallucinations, this progression involves first mishearing ambiguous stimuli as voices and then attributing the voices to some cause (e. g., insanity, the television, radio, or God). Later, the frequent and ongoing chains of such behavior may contaminate other verbal responses. Such verbal behavior may be parasitic on “normal verbal behavior” (and hence, not directly dependent on consquences for maintenance), may be cued by various stimuli (including respiration), and may interfere with other covert and overt behavior. Several studies to investigate this view are presented. It is hoped that such research will lead {{to a better understanding of}} the major issues involved in the etiology and treatment of auditory hallucinations in particular and perhaps of psychosis in general...|$|E

40|$|Abstract for the 6 th International Conference on Advanced Technology and Particle Physics, {{to be held}} at Villa Olmo, Como, Italy, 5 - 9 October 1998. For {{a couple}} of the last decades Micro-channel plates (MCPs) are known as a fast (1 ns), fine {{granularity}} (5 - 12 µ), high gain (10 3 - 10 4), excellent time resolution (30 - 50 ps), high counting rate (10 11 1 /cm 2 was reported) and efficient detector widely used in low energy nuclear physics. Nevertheless, these nice features have not been exploited sufficiently in the high energy experiments so far. The use of MCPs in the HEP experiments demands the developments of technologies different from the low-energy applications: in particular the low mass vacuum thin-wall chambers in the UHV technique. It is the great intrinsic capability of the MCPs for the registration of MIPs, high gain and sharp signals that prompted us to develop a fast multiplicity detector for ALICE at the LHC. The chevron MCP setup (gain up to 10 * 8) gives a strong signal for the Ultra High Frequency (UHF) readout system capable of combining hte isochronous fast components of the signal summation over the MCP disk with the charge registration from the individual pads for any event. This isochronous multipad readout is based on a specifically developed multichannel passive <b>summator</b> (which serves also as the UHF filter). In the present report we present the status of the isochronous MCP disk development and the experimental tests: model simulations of the MCP detector performance in heavy ion collisions at the LHC tests of various MCP structures (small area prototypes and sector multipad prototype).
