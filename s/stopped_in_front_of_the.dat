2500|$|At [...] a {{creeping}} barrage began and the British troops advanced. German flares were seen rising but the German artillery response {{was slow and}} missed the attackers. In the 18th Division area, German machine-gun fire from pillboxes caused many losses to the 53rd Brigade, which was <b>stopped</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> north-west corner of Inverness Copse. Part of the brigade managed to work forward further north and formed a defensive flank along {{the southern edge of}} Glencorse Wood. To the north, the 169th Brigade of the 56th Division advanced quickly at the start but veered to the right around boggy ground, then entered Glencorse Wood. The German main line of resistance was in a sunken road inside the wood, where after a hard-fought and mutually costly engagement, the German defenders were overrun {{and the rest of the}} wood occupied. The leading waves then advanced to Polygon Wood.|$|E

The left-hand battalion was <b>stopped</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trench with many casualties and the brigade withdrew at nightfall. A few troops of the right-flank battalion of the 9th Brigade of the 3rd Canadian Division got into Regina Trench, through some German sally ports but were overwhelmed. The left-hand battalion had reached Regina Trench, where it joined Courcelette Trench and been forced back by the defenders. Part of the 7th Brigade reached Regina Trench and began to bomb westwards and also worked its way up West Miraumont Road but was eventually forced back by German counter-attacks. The left hand battalion was obstructed by new German barbed wire covered by machine-guns and was not able to advance up Kenora Trench. Relief of the Canadian Corps began on 10 October.|$|E
2500|$|A {{combination}} of tyre issues and a fuel-pressure problem resulted in {{his failure to}} qualify for the San Marino Grand Prix, the only time this happened during his career. Toleman decided not to run both cars during Friday qualifying at Imola due to a dispute with tyre supplier Pirelli (Toleman {{were in the process of}} switching from Pirelli to Michelin). Senna then suffered a fuel-pressure problem in the wet Saturday session at Tosa (the furthest point on the circuit from the pits) and did not have enough time for it to be fixed to allow him to make the grid. Senna's best result of the season came at the Monaco Grand Prix, the first wet-weather race of the season. Qualifying 13th on the grid, he made steady progress in climbing through the field, passing Niki Lauda for second on lap 19. He quickly began to cut the gap to race leader Alain Prost, but before he could attack Prost, the race was stopped on lap 31 for safety reasons, as the rain had grown even heavier. At the time the race was stopped, Senna was catching Prost by about 4 seconds per lap (while the Tyrrell-Ford of Stefan Bellof was catching both at the same rate). Senna passed Prost when Prost <b>stopped</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> red flag, before the end of the 32nd lap. According to the rules, the positions counted were those from the last lap completed by every driver, lap 31, at which point Prost was still leading. [...] Senna's second place was his first podium in Formula One. The popular belief was that with Prost's McLaren-TAG having major brake troubles (they were regularly locking up due to not generating enough heat in the conditions), the premature ending of the race had robbed Senna of his maiden Grand Prix win.|$|E
