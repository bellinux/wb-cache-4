40|$|Abstract. We {{set up a}} {{two-stage}} {{game with}} sequential moves by one altruistic agent and n selfish agents. The rotten kid theorem states that the altruist can only reach her first best when the selfish agents move before the altruist. The Samaritan’s dilemma, on the other hand, states that the altruist can only reach her first best when <b>she</b> <b>moves</b> before the selfish agents. We find that in general, the altruist can reach her first best when <b>she</b> <b>moves</b> first, {{if and only if}} a selfish agent’s action marginally only affects his own payoff. The altruist can reach her first best when <b>she</b> <b>moves</b> last if and only if a selfish agent cannot manipulate the price of his payoff. When the altruist cannot reach her first best when <b>she</b> <b>moves</b> last, the outcome is not Pareto efficient either. JEL Classification: D 6...|$|R
