5|$|The game engine—proprietary IW engine 2.0—is a {{modified}} version of id Tech 3, which was used in the first Call of Duty game. With the new game engine, Infinity Ward expanded the scope of combat to deliver a realistic battlefield experience and improved the visuals. The developers were able to cloud visibility with <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> smoke grenades and create weather effects like dusty sandstorms and whiteout blizzard.|$|E
5|$|Edward Felt dialed 9-1-1 {{from his}} cell phone from the rear {{lavatory}} of the aircraft seeking information at 09:58. His call was answered by dispatcher John Shaw, and Felt was able {{to tell him about}} the hijacking before the call was disconnected. Multiple news reports (originally based on a 9-1-1 supervisor's account after having overheard the call) asserted that Edward Felt reported hearing an explosion and seeing <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> an undetermined location on the plane. These reports were not corroborated by Shaw or Felt's wife, Sandra, who listened to the recording afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Polonium is a {{very rare}} element in nature because of the short {{half-life}} of all its isotopes. 210Po, 214Po, and 218Po appear in the decay chain of 238U; thus polonium {{can be found in}} uranium ores at about 0.1mg per metric ton (1 part in 1010), which is approximately 0.2% of the abundance of radium. The amounts in the Earth's crust are not harmful. Polonium has been found in tobacco <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> tobacco leaves grown with phosphate fertilizers.|$|E

5|$|The 1900 season {{revealed}} grave {{problems with}} Rostislavs boilers. Black <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> burning oil was more conspicuous than coal smoke. Uneven distribution of heat inside the boilers caused severe local overheating, buckling of fireboxes and sudden backdrafts. For {{three and a}} half months the boilers failed one by one, starting with small auxiliary power units and ending with the main boilers. Oil delivered by the Rothschild-controlled Russian Standard Oil was not at fault; similar problems were experienced by oil-fired ships of the Baltic Fleet.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{had three}} tiers of {{artillery}} – the heaviest and longest range weapons occupying the upper levels, including the keep – {{with a total}} of 39 firing positions, and 31 gunloops in the basement for handguns should close defence be required. The embrasures in the walls were all widely splayed to provide the maximum possible space for the guns to operate and traverse, and the interior of the castle was designed with vents to allow the <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> its guns to escape.|$|E
5|$|The final {{gradient}} from Camden Town to Euston {{involved a}} crossing over the Regent's Canal {{that required a}} gradient of over 1 in 68. Because steam trains at the time could not climb such an ascent, they were cable-hauled on the down line towards Camden until 1844, after which they used a pilot engine. The L's Act of Parliament prohibited the use of locomotives in the Euston area, following concerns of local residents about noise and <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> locomotives toiling up the incline.|$|E
5000|$|Accounts of the {{billowing}} smoke {{were reported}} in Korean and international newspapers; [...] and thick columns of black <b>smoke</b> rising <b>from</b> the island were the primary proof that the attack had occurred.

5|$|The fire {{began at}} 2:15pm local time (06:15 UTC) around the tenth floor. The building, {{constructed}} in 1997, was {{located at the}} intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Yuyao Road in Shanghai's Jing'an District, and was being renovated {{at the time of the}} fire. Witnesses said that the fire started with construction materials and spread throughout the building. It took over 80 fire engines and several hours to contain the fire. Shanghai residents were able to see <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> the fire several kilometres away. Firefighters were unable to hose water on the top of the -tall building from the ground.|$|E
5|$|The tests {{revealed}} {{a number of}} problems in that the thick wing inherited from the Yak-3 limited the top speed of the aircraft, the engine exhaust damaged the surface of the airfield, the cockpit often filled with <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> kerosene and oil that had dripped onto the engine, and the aircraft was very short-ranged. Despite these problems, the Yak-15 proved to be very easy to fly, even for pilots accustomed to piston-engined fighters, and caused the VVS to accept the fighter as a conversion trainer.|$|E
5|$|They {{went on to}} Albemarle Island, where Darwin saw a small jet of <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> a {{recently}} active volcano. On 1 October he landed near Tagus Cove and explored Beagle Crater. There he saw his first Galapagos land iguanas. Water pits were disappointingly inadequate for drinking, but attracted swarms of small birds and Darwin made his only note of the finches he was not bothering to label by island. He caught a third species of mockingbird.|$|E

5|$|Who started {{shooting}} first is not certain; accounts by both participants and eyewitnesses are contradictory. The <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> the black powder {{used in the}} weapons added to the confusion of the gunfight in the narrow space.

The six or seven men with guns fired about 30 shots in around 30 seconds.|$|E
5|$|At the September 11 Battle of Brandywine, the 4th Virginia Brigade stubbornly {{resisted}} {{the advance of}} General Charles Cornwallis, but was ultimately forced to retreat. Following the British victory, Howe marched toward Philadelphia, stopping briefly at Germantown. Scott persistently advocated for an attack on Howe's position at Germantown, and although he was initially in the minority among Washington's generals, he ultimately prevailed upon Washington to conduct the attack. On October 4, 1777, the 4th Virginia attacked the British in the Battle of Germantown. Because of their circuitous route to the battle, however, the field was already covered by heavy <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> muskets and a fire set by the British in a dry buckwheat field when they arrived; eventually, they and the other colonial forces {{were lost in the}} smoke and retreated.|$|E
5|$|For {{six days}} prior to the {{beginning}} of the American offensive, Allied heavy artillery targeted German defenses around Aachen. Although the heavy bombardment forced the German LXXXI Corps to halt all daylight personnel and supply movements, it had little effect on the pillboxes and strongpoints. The opening aerial bombardment on 2 October also caused little damage to German defensive positions; the 450 aircraft which took part in the first wave failed to register a single direct hit on any German pillbox. Their targets had been largely obscured by thick <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> the Allied artillery barrage. As the aircraft finished their assault, the artillery resumed bombarding the front lines, firing 18,696 shells from 372 gun tubes within a couple of hours.|$|E

40|$|Marijuana is {{a mixture}} of dried, {{shredded}} flowers and leaves of the hemp plant (Cannabis sativa). It’s also called, among other names, pot, dope, weed, grass, ganja and chronic. Marijuana is generally smoked in hand-rolled cigarettes called joints, or less commonly, in emptied-out cigars called blunts. It can also be <b>smoked</b> <b>from</b> a pipe or bong (a water pipe). Some people ingest marijuana with food or drink; for example, it can be baked into brownies or brewed into a tea. Marijuana contains hundreds of chemical compounds. The main ingredient, and the main cause of intoxication, is Tetra hydrocannabinol (THC). Hashish (hash) is made from the concentrated resin, or sap, of the hemp plant. Its THC content is higher than marijuana. It’s generally <b>smoked</b> <b>from</b> a pipe or bong but can also be added to a joint or a regular cigarette...|$|R

5|$|Luton Town's {{first ground}} was at Dallow Lane, the former ground of Excelsior. The ground {{was next to}} the Dunstable to Luton train line, and players {{regularly}} claimed to have trouble seeing the ball because of <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> the trains. A damaging financial loss during 1896–97 forced Luton to sell the stadium to stay afloat and, as a result, the club moved across the tracks to a stadium between the railway and Dunstable Road. The Dunstable Road ground was opened by Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford, who also donated £50 towards the £800 building costs. When the site was sold for housing in 1905, the club was forced to move again at short notice, to its present Kenilworth Road site, {{in time for the}} start of the 1905–06 season.|$|E
5|$|Passive smoking—the {{inhalation}} of <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> another's smoking—is a {{cause of}} lung cancer in nonsmokers. A passive smoker {{can be defined as}} someone living or working with a smoker. Studies from the US, Europe and the UK have consistently shown a significantly increased risk among those exposed to passive smoke. Those who live with someone who smokes have a 20–30% increase in risk while those who work in an environment with secondhand smoke have a 16–19% increase in risk. Investigations of sidestream smoke suggest it is more dangerous than direct smoke. Passive smoking causes about 3,400 deaths from lung cancer each year in the USA.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1945 (when Pius XII {{changed the}} form of ballot to use {{anonymous}} oaths, first carried out in 1958), the sealing wax on the complex type ballots illustrated above {{had the effect of}} making the <b>smoke</b> <b>from</b> burning the ballots either black or white, depending on whether or not damp straw was added. Until the 20th century, sealing wax customarily had beeswax mixed into its composition. The use of wax made solely from animal fat does not give as much white colored smoke, as does wax that includes beeswax. In the 1939 conclave there was some confusion over the smoke color, which was even more apparent in the 1958 conclave. This explains the confusion over the color of the smoke in the 1958 Papal conclave, caused by the lack of sealing wax on the ballots. The Siri thesis was based on the confusion over the smoke color {{on the first day of}} that conclave.|$|E
