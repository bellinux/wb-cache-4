5|$|On May28, the NHC {{once again}} {{initiated}} outlooks {{on the system}} as convection quickly redeveloped. Around 1500UTC, they designated the system as Tropical Depression One while it was located about 310mi (500km) south of Providence, Rhode Island. Upon being classified, the depression exhibited deep convective activity, with the center of circulation situated on the northwestern edge. The redevelopment of the system {{was the result of}} low wind shear and warm waters, up to , from the Gulf Stream. Later that day, convection began to diminish as the depression tracked into an area of progressively higher shear and cooler waters. By this time, the system was embedded within the westerlies between a subtropical ridge to the southeast and a trough to the northwest. Around 2330UTC, a QuickSCAT <b>satellite</b> <b>pass</b> over the depression found tropical storm-force winds; however, the winds were determined to have been affected by rain and therefore not representative of the depression's actual intensity. Following the <b>satellite</b> <b>pass,</b> the center of circulation became partially exposed to the northwest and the area of convection associated with the depression diminished in area.|$|E
5|$|On September26, a {{very large}} extratropical area of low {{pressure}} developed along a quasi-stationary frontal system a few hundred miles west of the Azores. The low intensified into the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane with winds of 80mph (130km/h) at 12:00UTC on September27. Over the following days, the low began to lose its frontal features and began to transition into a subtropical cyclone as it traveled in a general westward direction. By September29, the low had developed sufficient convection and was declared Subtropical Storm Laura. Upon being upgraded, cold cloud tops began to wrap around the center of Laura and consolidate near the center of circulation. The convection organized around the center quickly and a <b>satellite</b> <b>pass</b> over the storm revealed that it could be intensifying. A later <b>satellite</b> <b>pass</b> disregarded the possibility of intensification as the intensity was confirmed to be at 60mph (95km/h). The overall structure of Laura remained subtropical but there were indications that it was acquiring tropical characteristics.|$|E
5|$|On June 26, a small {{burst of}} {{moisture}} in the system was noted {{in the area of}} the wave, but no other notable development occurred. On July 2, the wave moved over Central America and produced scattered areas of strong convection off the coast of Honduras. Later in the day, the center of the wave became elongated as determined by a QuikSCAT <b>satellite</b> <b>pass.</b> By the afternoon, the wave developed into an area of low pressure and a tropical cyclone formation alert was issued as the possibility of a tropical cyclone developing within 48 hours was present.|$|E

50|$|Initial {{operations}} of early DMSP systems provided radio return of cloud-cover imagery for planning of U.S. high-resolution photographic reconnaissance and surveillance missions, which utilized film-return systems. DMSP satellites operated in a sun-synchronous orbit; passing {{over the north}} and south poles, the satellite would see different strips of the Earth at the same local time each day. The DMSP satellites had periods of roughly 101 minutes, so they would orbit the Earth 14.3 times in 24 hours.

50|$|Due to {{the high}} orbital speed of the amateur-satellites, the uplink and {{downlink}} frequencies will vary {{during the course of}} a <b>satellite</b> <b>pass.</b> This phenomenon is known as the Doppler effect. While the satellite is moving towards the ground station, the downlink frequency will appear to be higher than normal and therefore, the receiver frequency at the ground station must be adjusted higher in order to continue receiving the satellite. The satellite in turn, will be receiving the uplink signal at a higher frequency than normal so the ground station's transmitted uplink frequency must be lower in order to be received by the satellite. After the satellite passes overhead and begins to move away, this process reverses itself. The downlink frequency will appear lower and the uplink frequency will need to be adjusted higher. The following mathematical formulas relate the doppler shift to the velocity of the satellite.|$|E
50|$|Russia {{developed}} the original system, and its success drove {{the desire to}} develop the improved 406 MHz system. The original system was a brilliant adaptation to the low quality beacons, originally designed to aid air searches. It used just a simple, lightweight transponder on the satellite, with no digital recorders or other complexities. Ground stations listened to each satellite {{as long as it}} was above the horizon. Doppler shift was used to locate the beacon(s). Multiple beacons were separated when a computer program analysed the signals with a fast fourier transform. Also, two satellite passes per beacon were used. This eliminated false alarms by using two measurements to verify the beacon's location from two different bearings. This prevented false alarms from VHF channels that affected a single satellite. Regrettably, the second <b>satellite</b> <b>pass</b> almost doubled the average time before notification of the rescuing authority. However, the notification time was much less than a day.|$|E

30|$|We propose {{correcting}} Swarm data by zeroing {{the flow}} at the low-latitude {{boundary of the}} convection zone (i.e., where convection {{is expected to be}} zero). Here the low-latitude boundary is defined as the HMB corresponding to the CS 10 statistical convection model for the solar wind and IMF conditions that exist during the <b>satellite</b> <b>pass.</b> This is done as follows: (1) Identify the IMF and solar wind conditions for the <b>satellite</b> <b>pass,</b> and the corresponding CS 10 statistical model. In this paper, we only consider satellite passes that occur during periods of quasi-stable solar wind and IMF. (2) Identify the two points where the orbital footprints of the Swarm satellite cross the HMB of the CS 10 statistical model. (3) Determine the average along-track and cross-track ion drift at the intersection points identified in (2). These averages define the along-track and cross-track offsets. Note that by averaging the data {{at either end of the}} <b>satellite</b> <b>pass,</b> this method assumes stability of the offset throughout each ~ 20 -min pass the satellite makes of the high-latitude region. Such conditions are met in this study due to the assumption of quasi-stability in the solar wind and IMF. Note that in passes where ion drifts calculated at one end of the <b>satellite</b> <b>pass</b> were contaminated by data of poor quality, then data from only the other end of the <b>satellite</b> <b>pass</b> were used as the offset value. (4) Correct Swarm ion drift measurements are carried out by subtracting the along-track offset from the along-track data and the cross-track offset from the cross-track data.|$|E
