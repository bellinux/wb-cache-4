40|$|Construction is a {{strategic}} industry in developing economies like Kenya. In order for construction to ably perform this role, {{there is a}} need to provide information on its various economic aspects including raw materials, products, processes, finance and labour. Construction statistics of Kenya have been evaluated in order to ascertain their adequacy in terms of scope, portrait, reliability and responsiveness in their coverage of the construction industry. Official statistics published in the annual Statistical Abstract were reviewed according to these adequacy criteria. The findings are that: the scope of construction statistics is narrowly defined making the statistical portrait of the sector incomplete; the statistics are also unreliable in terms of quality and unresponsive to economical challenges of inflation, structural adjustment policies and the decline of the public sector's role in the construction industry. A participatory <b>statistical</b> <b>governance</b> framework is recommended in order to improve the scope of statistics and alleviate the attendant problems, such as the incomplete portrait, that come with the narrow scope.

40|$|The {{modernisation}} {{of local}} government has attempted to reinvent central–local government relations by offering freedoms and flexibilities to facilitate the governance of local issues. At the same time, a shift to outcome focussed targets as {{a new form of}} governmental rationality allows central government to delimit these opportunities. Drawing on aspects of governmentality and actor-network theory, the paper explores the tensions between these modes of government. It argues that outcome focussed targets circumscribe the limits of local governance by offering a despatialised technology of government. Using a case study of Local Public Service Agreements, the paper highlights the problems 10 English rural local authorities have experienced in their attempts to construct and negotiate a series of local policy targets with central government. The paper shows how the spatial limitations of <b>statistical</b> <b>governance</b> conspire against the construction of targets which reflect local policy priorities. In conclusion we consider {{the extent to which these}} limitations are a deliberate act of control and consider the implications for agency within networks of governmentality...|$|E
40|$|The issues {{referring}} to official statistics quality and reliability became the main topics of debates {{as far as}} <b>statistical</b> <b>governance</b> in Europe is concerned. The Council welcomed the Commission Communication to the European Parliament and to the Council « Towards robust quality management for European Statistics » (COM 211), appreciating that the approach and {{the objective of the}} strategy would confer the European Statistical System (ESS) the quality management framework for the coordination of consolidated economic policies. The Council pointed out that the European Statistical System management was improved during recent years, that progress was noticed in relation with high quality statistics production and dissemination within the European Union, but has also noticed that, in the context of recent financial crisis, certain weaknesses were identified, particularly related to quality management general framework. „Greece Case” proved that progresses were not enough for guaranteeing the complete independence of national statistical institutes and entailed the need for further consolidating ESS governance. Several undertakings are now in the preparatory stage, in accordance with the Commission Communication; these actions are welcomed, but the question arise: are these sufficient for definitively solving the problem?The paper aims to go ahead in the attempt of identifying a different way, innovative (courageous!) on the long run, towards an advanced institutional structure of ESS, by setting up the European System of Statistical Institutes, similar to the European System of Central Banks, that would require a change in the Treaty...|$|E

40|$|Political risk assessment, {{together}} with portfolio analysis, {{has become an}} important part of international business investment decision making. In this paper, by using different knowledge discovery techniques, we attempt to assess the relevance and actionability of [`]good governance' indicators in political risk assessment. For that purpose, we have integrated good governance indicators data with political instability classification from the Political Instability Task Force (PITF) research. From this study, two models that capture the intuitive reasoning of investors have been developed. The usefulness of the models has been evaluated by comparison with factual investment data. Our findings suggest that quantitative indicators of good governance may provide the basis for accurate and meaningful models for the assessment and prediction of political risk.

40|$|Contemporary <b>statistical</b> {{details of}} <b>governance</b> and {{succession}} on New Zealand farms are not available. This study involved a New Zealand wide postal survey {{to find out}} the current situation. Over 2000 randomly selected farms, the selection being proportional to region, farm type and farm hectarage strata, were mailed a questionnaire starting in June 2013. The response rate was 36 per cent providing 805 useable responses. Part time farmer’s replies were discarded. The response rate was greater than the norm. The information collected forms a comprehensive data base which creates a benchmark on which to judge future systems and arrangements made by NZ farmers and their advisors. Besides information on governance, succession and ownership a range of additional information was obtained to allow assessing farmers’ approaches to these critical areas...|$|R
40|$|Since the Rome Treaties, the {{question}} of the organisation of macroeconomic and monetary policy has been a key issue in the debates on European integration. In this paper we explore the continuity and changes in these debates. We focus on macroeconomic thought at the European Commission in two periods: the 1960 s and early 2000. There are important changes, especially in the areas of monetary policy and structural policies. In the early period, exchange rate disturbances (like after May 1968 in France), constituted an important threat to the European project. With the realisation of monetary union and a stability-oriented monetary policy, monetary disturbances and threats have largely disappeared. So, according to the Commission analysis, there has been substantial progress in this area. With respect to structural policy, one can observe profound changes in the underlying economic policy paradigms. While state intervention was high on the agenda in the 1960 s, now a more market conform approach is advocated, which is also prominent in the Lisbon strategy. There is also a change in methodology: from "programming" to the "open method of coordination", even if both are set in a medium-term framework. However, looking at the coordination of budgetary policy, the issue is much more complicated. With the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact, the European Union made a choice for a rules based fiscal framework. However, as is well known, there have been problems in this area. In fact, there are some remarkable continuities here with the 1960 s. Several issues, which were prominent on the Commission agenda then (like, how to have influence on Member State policies, <b>statistical</b> <b>governance,</b> the construction of early warning indicators) are still there today. Consequently, the Commission is now, very much in line with a political economy approach, seeking to increase the national "ownership" of the budgetary and reform policies which it advocates...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} examine what {{shareholders}} think about auditors in relation with corporate governance {{by using an}} inferential descriptive <b>statistical</b> analysis. Corporate <b>governance</b> has shown flaws; where {{part of it was}} done to the weakness of shareholders activism, and because auditing is a very important avenue of faithful representation (credibility gap) of financial statements, and shareholders depend on auditors’ reports, this article utilized primary data by distributing a questionnaire to the shareholders representatives in Amman Stock Exchange that focused on the affect of the auditors’ independency and code of ethics on the credibility gap, including demographic factors. Results showed a positive relationship between the auditors’ independency and there implementation of the code of ethics on the credibility gap, and results also showed that females were more realizable of the credibility gap than males...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the <b>statistical</b> importance of <b>governance</b> infrastructure as a determinant of U. S. foreign direct investment. In broad terms, governance infrastructure represents attributes of legislation, regulation, and legal systems that condition freedom of transacting, security {{of property rights}} and transparency of government and legal processes. Our econometric analysis employs a two-stage estimation procedure. In the first stage, {{the probability that a}} country is an FDI recipient is estimated. The results indicate that countries that fail to achieve a minimum threshold of effective governance are unlikely to receive any U. S. FDI. Countries that receive no U. S. FDI are typically countries that do not promote free and transparent markets, have ineffective governments, and are often countries whose legal systems are not rooted in English Common Law. In the second stage, the analysis is restricted to those countries that did receive FDI flows. The estimated equations focus on the determinants of the amount of FDI received. Given that a country is a recipient of U. S. FDI, governance infrastructure, including the nature of the legal system, is an important determinant of the amount received. foreign direct investment, capital flows, multinational corporations, infrastructure, governance...|$|R
40|$|Development {{paradigms}} {{changes over}} time. The latest buzzword ‘good governance’ has endured {{for more than}} a decade. Contemporary literature maintains the need for institutions such as good governance as a means of achieving economic growth. However, despite a prolonged emphasis on good governance institutions by development actors including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, poverty remains prevalent in the world. Through an unorthodox method balancing between qualitative and quantitative, this study deductively makes an effort to test the recent literature within new institutional economics, with the aim to investigate whether normative institutions such as good governance are causing economic growth. By assessing and correlating gross domestic product per capita growth and governance levels in the cases of Botswana, Namibia and South Africa the analysis methodologically seeks after congruence in the empirical evidence with institutional theory. Numeric data derived from The World Bank are used as dataset. The findings indicate, despite a coincidental occurrence of high institutional quality and economic performance in the three cases, that good governance lacks causality on economic growth. Also, problems of using and measuring <b>statistical</b> data on <b>governance</b> and economic growth are discussed. This study concludes that albeit the normative good governance institutions lack causality there might be other institutional arrangements that are a prerequisite for growth...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, {{there has been a}} drive to reduce complex {{concepts}} into simple numbers. Corruption, rule of law, human rights, and more have all been reduced to quantitative indicators. Under the theory that what gets measured gets done, international law has begun relying on these tools to operationalize global norms and assess compliance. In particular, private regulatory bodies are using indicators to claim scientific authority as they set global standards and shape domestic law. Yet legal scholarship has been largely silent about the implications of these <b>statistical</b> tools for <b>governance.</b> In this Article, I analyze the prevalence of quantitative indicators as a regulatory tool, identify the limits of using these techniques to inform decision making, and offer recommendations on how to increase their legitimacy in domestic and global governance. The appeal of indicators lies in their ability to translate social phenomena into a numerical representation that is transparent, easy to understand, and comparable across actors. Yet I argue that there are potential costs of incorporating indicators in regulation - specifically, the promotion of box-ticking and superficial compliance, the dominance of technical experts over decision making, and the distortion of public values when converted to numbers. My analysis draws from an empirical study of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), based on personal interviews and participation in a GRI-certified training program. The GRI is a private transnational body that has produced the leading standard for sustainability reporting, used by more than three-quarters of the Global Fortune 250 companies. Its guidelines include 79 indicators for corporations to report on their social, environmental, and economic performance. Based on this study, I contend that the use of indicators can be fraught with problems, which are often overlooked due to the authoritative nature of numbers. In order to maximize their effectiveness, I recommend that government agencies and private actors design meaningful indicators, avoid data overload, require third-party verification, and expand participation by citizens and a broad group of experts...|$|R
40|$|This Technical Report on Spatial Disaggregation and Small-Area Estimation Methods for Agricultural Surveys: Solutions and Perspectives was {{prepared}} {{within the framework}} of the Global Strategy to Improve Agricultural and Rural Statistics. The Global Strategy is an initiative endorsed in 2010 by the United Nations Statistical Commission, to provide a framework and a blueprint to meet current and emerging data requirements and the needs of policymakers and other data users. Its goal is to contribute to greater food security, reduced food price volatility, higher incomes and greater well-being for rural populations, through evidence-based policies. The Global Strategy is centred upon 3 pillars: (1) establishing a minimum set of core data (2) integrating agriculture into National Statistical Systems (NSSs) and (3) fostering the sustainability of the <b>statistical</b> system through <b>governance</b> and <b>statistical</b> capacity building. The Action Plan to Implement the Global Strategy includes an important research programme, to address methodological issues for improving the quality of agricultural and rural statistics. The outcome of the research programme is to produce scientifically sound and cost-effective methods that will be used as inputs to prepare practical guidelines for use by country statisticians, training institutions, consultants, etc. To enable countries and partners to benefit at an early stage from research activity results that are already available, it has been decided to establish a Technical Reports Series, to widely disseminate available technical reports and advanced draft guidelines and handbooks. This will also provide an opportunity for countries to give feedback on the papers. Technical reports and draft guidelines and handbooks published in this Technical Report Series have been prepared by senior consultants and experts and reviewed by the Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) 1 of the Global Strategy, the Research Coordinator at the Global Office and other independent senior experts. For some of the research topics, field tests will be organized before final results are included in guidelines and handbooks. The aim of this report on Spatial Disaggregation and Small-Area Estimation Methods for Agricultural Surveys: Solutions and Perspectives is to enhance disaggregation methods for adaptation to various agricultural situations and datasets. Part 1 reviews the literature on this subject under two topics: i) mapping techniques and ii) small-area estimators. With regard to mapping techniques, the main areal interpolation methods based on regression techniques are presented. SAE methods are classified as: i) model-assisted methods – for example the generalized regression estimator; and ii) model-based methods, which are considered as unit-level and area-level specifications – the empirical best linear unbiased predictors estimator, M-quantile estimator and Fay and Herriot estimator – with spatial specifications where available. Assumptions are explained and the information needed for each method is given, with illustrations from applications to rural and agricultural statistics or to socio-economic statistics. Part 2 examines the reliability of the methods in non-standard situations that commonly arise in agricultural surveys. The main topics are sensitivity to spatial model specification, the modifiable area unit problem, robustness of predictors, complexity of sample design, missing data in spatial datasets and excess of zeros in survey data. This part analyses the methods presented in Part 1, presents the main contributions to the topics and proposes methodological and operational solutions. Part 3 summarizes the issues in the review of mapping techniques and small-area estimators. It also offers remarks and recommendations based on the analysis of the reliability of the methods and draft guidelines for applying them in field tests...|$|R
