5|$|Players {{and game}} journalists {{consider}} the game among the Spectrum's best. <b>Sabre</b> Wulf {{was the first}} of four titles in the Sabreman series for the ZX Spectrum. Retro Gamer credited the character's name and character traits for its lasting memorability. As an ordinary human with a hat and exaggerated nose, Sabreman fit the video game 8-bit era's character archetype. The last, unreleased game in the Spectrum Sabreman series, Mire Mare, was planned to have been similar to <b>Sabre</b> Wulf in gameplay. Rare, the successor to Ultimate, later released a side-scrolling platformer in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance handheld console—also titled <b>Sabre</b> Wulf—in which Sabreman enlists jungle animals to solve the <b>Sabre</b> Wulf's puzzles. It was not received well by fans. Elements from the original <b>Sabre</b> Wulf appear in other games, including Rare's Jet Force Gemini. Retro Gamer considered Sabreman's recurring appearance to be proof of Rare's interest in the character and series.|$|E
5|$|The RAAF {{moved to}} rectify the {{situation}} by re-forming No.2OTU on 1March 1952 to convert RAAF pilots to jet aircraft and train them for fighter operations. Headquartered at RAAF Base Williamtown, it was equipped with Wirraways, Mustangs, and deHavilland Vampire jets. Cresswell took command of No.2 OTU on 21May 1953. The unit ceased flying Mustangs that October, retaining its Wirraways and Vampires. In April 1954, it began conducting fighter combat instructor courses, as well as refresher courses on jets. Cresswell delivered the first Australian-built CAC <b>Sabre</b> jet fighter to No.2 OTU in November, and the same month established the unit's <b>Sabre</b> Trials Flight. The flight was responsible for performance testing and developing combat flying techniques, {{in concert with the}} Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU). On 3December 1954, Creswell led a formation of twelve No.2 OTU Vampires in the shape of two sevens over Sydney to greet No.77 Squadron upon its arrival from service in Korea aboard the aircraft carrier HMAS Vengeance. Training courses on the <b>Sabre</b> began on 1January 1955. Once the <b>Sabre</b> entered operational service in March 1956, the <b>Sabre</b> Trials Flight was dissolved and its responsibilities passed to No.3 Squadron. Pilots underwent their introduction to jets and fighter combat at No.2 OTU, but finished their conversion to Sabres at a front-line squadron.|$|E

5|$|The last <b>Sabre</b> {{conversion}} {{course was}} completed in December 1970. Early the following year, the Australian government announced that the Sabres were to be phased out and retired by July 1971. At this time RAAF fighter pilots were trained progressively on the CAC Winjeel, Macchi, <b>Sabre</b> and Mirage, but after considering the feasibility of direct Macchi-to-Mirage conversion, and the impracticability of maintaining the ageing Sabres, the government determined {{that it was possible}} to remove the <b>Sabre</b> from the process and retire the type, on the proviso that more Mirage trainers were made available; it subsequently approved the purchase of six new Mirage IIID dual trainers to augment the ten already in service. No.5 OTU was disbanded on 31July 1971, the date the <b>Sabre</b> was retired from RAAF service. The unit's Macchis were transferred back to No.2 OCU.|$|E

Voting is conducted to determine the fourth event. In 2004, the three men's team events and the women's épée were held. Thus, in 2008, the women's foil and <b>sabre</b> events and men's épée were automatically selected. Men's <b>sabre</b> was chosen over foil by a 45–20 vote.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers {{complained of}} the game's high price, which was {{nearly double the}} average. Crash {{wondered}} if the cost might lead to more piracy. Critics also noted a bug in two-player mode, repeat screens from elsewhere in the maze, and the frustratingly narrow window in which <b>sabre</b> swings register as enemy hits. CVG recommended drawing {{a map of the}} maze, without which it was easy to get lost. While <b>Sabre</b> Wulf had some flicker issues, said Sinclair User, the game altogether met Ultimate's high quality benchmarks.|$|E
5|$|The {{developer}} of <b>Sabre</b> Wulf, Ultimate Play the Game, {{had a reputation}} for secrecy. The company rarely gave interviews or revealed details about their internal practices or upcoming games. Little is known about their development process apart from that they used Sage IV computers, preferred to develop for the ZX Spectrum's Z80 microprocessor, and often outsourced development for other platforms, such as those that ran 6502 microprocessors. After releasing Atic Atac at the end of 1983, Ultimate went silent until it ran teaser advertisements for <b>Sabre</b> Wulf in April 1984. The company rarely depicted actual gameplay in their advertisements. They had already prepared Knight Lore, the third game in the Sabreman series, in advance of the character's introduction in <b>Sabre</b> Wulf. Ultimate withheld Knight Lore for about a year because they felt <b>Sabre</b> Wulf would not have sold as well once players saw the former's graphical advancements. Knight Lore subsequently became known as a seminal work in British gaming history and an iconic game of the 1980s for its popularization of the isometric platformer format.|$|E
5|$|The eighth season largely {{centers on}} Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) {{ascension}} to regional manager, {{as well as}} the antics of Robert California (James Spader), the new CEO of <b>Sabre,</b> a fictional printer company that owns Dunder Mifflin. Halfway through the season, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson)—along with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker), Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), and Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad)—travel to Florida to help set up a <b>Sabre</b> Store, where Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) is introduced.

5|$|The eighth {{season of}} The Office largely {{centers around the}} antics of the new <b>Sabre</b> CEO, Robert California. Initially, he appears calm, collected, and calculating. However, as the season progresses, it becomes obvious that his {{management}} style is slowly destroying the company. Dwight—along with Jim, Stanley, Ryan, Erin, and Cathy (Lindsay Broad)—travel to Florida to help set up a <b>Sabre</b> Store, where Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) is introduced. Eventually, former CFO of Dunder Mifflin David Wallace buys back the company, firing California.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens to}} music {{composed}} by Johann Sebastian Bach. Its tiled maze contains 256 screens and is drawn in a 16 by 16 grid. The maze's paths are bordered by tropical flora, populated with attacking enemies and, on its outskirts, surrounded by mountains. Apart from the jungle, the game's maze also includes several lakes. The player swings Sabreman's <b>sabre</b> with {{the push of}} the joystick's fire button to defeat enemies that spawn in random on-screen locations. When the player idles too long in the same screen, an indestructible bushfire appears to pursue Sabreman. Enemies include spiders, scorpions, snakes, bats, indigenous people, sleeping hippos, and a fast wolf (the titular <b>Sabre</b> Wulf). Some enemies are killed, others flee when hit, while the wolf, cave guardian, and bushfire are unaffected by the <b>sabre.</b>|$|E
5|$|Twelve Egyptian fencers, six men and six women, {{qualified}} for the Olympics.

The final competitors, Mona Hassanein in the women's épée and Mannad Zeid in the men's <b>sabre,</b> won an African qualifier to earn their spots.

50|$|<b>Sabres</b> are elegant {{pieces of}} {{equipment}} used in winter guard. The length of <b>sabres</b> can range from about 30 - 39 inches (about 76 - 99 centimeters). They can either be plastic, metal, or plastic covered metal- though metal is more commonly used. Some metal <b>sabres</b> on the market are intricately decorated with engravings or etchings along the blade. These more intricately designed <b>sabres</b> {{tend to be more}} expensive.|$|R
50|$|Sylvester had an 11-year {{association}} with the Buffalo <b>Sabres.</b> He succeeded Josh Mora as the Sabres' studio host during the 2005-06 Buffalo <b>Sabres</b> season, and was the alternate play-by-play broadcaster during the 2011-12 season, handling {{the majority of the}} club's road games. His partner in the broadcast booth was veteran broadcaster Danny Gare, whose number has been retired by the <b>Sabres.</b> Since the 2008-09 season, he has been a substitute announcer for longtime play-by-play man Rick Jeanneret, who has called the team's games since the 1971-72 season. On June 18, 2012, Sylvester's new show, <b>Sabres</b> Hockey Hotline, debuted from the <b>Sabres</b> Store inside the First Niagara Center. Sylvester left the <b>Sabres</b> organization on April 8, 2016 to join the PGA.|$|R
5000|$|WNSA {{also created}} a fictitious radio fantasy hockey game called <b>Sabres</b> Showdown that pitted the Buffalo <b>Sabres</b> 1975 Stanley Cup finalists against the 1999 <b>Sabres</b> finalist squad. The game {{featured}} actual <b>Sabres</b> play-by-play man Rick Jeanneret and analyst Mike Robitaille calling the action as well as staged and archival interviews with <b>Sabres</b> players and management from both eras. The taped broadcast was enough of a success to be rerun a year after its original broadcast. Other unique features included [...] "Superfan," [...] a humorous short-form serial about a Buffalo sports fan endowed with superpowers, and [...] "Haseoke," [...] a feature in which audiotapes allegedly from <b>Sabres</b> goalie Dominik Hasek singing karaoke were played on-air (poking fun at Hasek's thick Bohemian accent).|$|R
5|$|Ultimate {{released}} {{the game for}} the ZX Spectrum at an above-average price to combat piracy. Its premium product packaging became a company standard. The developers had finished <b>Sabre</b> Wulf sequels in advance of its release but—in keeping with their penchant for secrecy—chose to withhold them for marketing purposes. The sequels were swiftly released later that year. Ultimate hired outside developers to port <b>Sabre</b> Wulf to other computing platforms: the BBC Micro, Commodore 64, and Amstrad CPC. The game was later featured in compilations including the 2015 retrospective of games by Ultimate and its successor, Rare.|$|E

5|$|At the <b>Sabre</b> store opening, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{attempts}} {{to put on}} a theatrical presentation to impress Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). Dwight assigns the members of his team various tasks: Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) is to act like a hipster to make the <b>Sabre</b> Pyramid more appealing, Cathy (Lindsey Broad) is to flirt with the bloggers, Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) is to give a presentation to wow the critics, and Todd Packer (David Koechner) is to play the part of a sexual predator— much to Packer's chagrin. As the grand opening progresses, things begin to fall apart. Several bloggers notice Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) using his old cell phone instead of his <b>Sabre</b> Arrowhead phone, resulting in a reprimand from Nellie. Erin disappears with a group of seniors after Dwight drives them away, fearing their age will frighten the youth. Ryan has a panic attack and, after being consoled by Dwight and Jim— who imitate Kelly and his mother respectively in an attempt to calm him down— leaves to go to his parents' house. Jim is forced to give the presentation, which, despite a rocky start, impresses the crowd. After the opening, Dwight is named vice president by Nellie.|$|E

50|$|At {{the end of}} the 2009-10 season, Kennedy’s {{entry-level}} contract expired {{resulting in}} a contract dispute with the <b>Sabres.</b> Kennedy went to arbitration to settle the contract dispute for the 2010-11 season. This resulted in an arbitration ruling of $1,000,000. In the dispute, Kennedy wanted a higher valued contract that was one-way to remain at the NHL level over the lesser two-way contract the <b>Sabres</b> were offering him that would have him split time between the <b>Sabres</b> and their AHL affiliate in Portland. The <b>Sabres</b> didn’t want to pay the additional amount. So on August 2, 2010, the <b>Sabres</b> waived Kennedy.|$|R
50|$|On July 5, 2011, Weber {{signed a}} multiyear {{contract}} with the Buffalo <b>Sabres.</b> Weber struggled during the 2011-12 season as he finished it with a minus-19 with the <b>Sabres</b> failing to make the playoffs. His play improved {{a lot for the}} shortended 2012-13 season after the acquisition of his longtime best friend Steve Ott. Weber established himself as a leader to the <b>Sabres</b> young defensive core, however the <b>Sabres</b> once again failed to make the playoffs for the second season in a row. Due to his improvement the <b>Sabres</b> re-signed Weber to a 3-year, $5 million contract extension.|$|R
