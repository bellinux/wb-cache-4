[...] Voorhis suggested that Nixon be challenged to debates {{as a matter of}} urgency. [...] Long responded in June, saying that though Nixon was known as a champion debater during his Whittier College days, [...] "with your age and experience the general public might not take kindly to your challenging a boy like Nixon". [...] Long advised awaiting a challenge from Nixon. [...] By August, the two campaigns had settled on a debate to be held before a veteran's group in Whittier on September 20. However, the [...] "Independent Voters of South Pasadena" [...] (IVSP), headed by future Voorhis biographer Paul Bullock, announced a September 13 town meeting on campaign issues at South Pasadena Junior High School. The IVSP's actual purpose in having the meeting was to get a vulnerable Republican assemblyman (who declined his invitation) to debate his Democratic rival, but Senate and 12th district Republican and Democratic candidates were invited. Given that the debate sponsors were liberals, some of Nixon's aides advised him to refuse, but he overrode them. Voorhis also accepted; when it was suggested to him later he should have sent a spokesman, he responded, [...] "I <b>suppose</b> <b>so,</b> but I just couldn't bring myself to refuse." [...] Both Senate candidates declined their invitations, with Senator Knowland sending Chotiner in his place, while Democratic candidate Will Rogers, Jr. sent Representative Chester E. Holifield of the neighboring 19th district.|$|E
