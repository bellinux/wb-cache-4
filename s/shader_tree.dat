50|$|Modo {{material}} {{assignment is}} done via a <b>shader</b> <b>tree</b> that is layer-based rather than node-based. As of version 801, node-based shading {{is a part}} of the work flow as well.|$|E
5000|$|Modo allows {{an artist}} to paint {{directly}} onto 3D models and even paint instances of existing meshes {{onto the surface of}} an object. The paint system allows users to use a combination of tools, brushes and inks to achieve many different paint effects and styles. Examples of the paint tools in Modo are airbrush, clone, smudge, and blur. These tools are paired with your choice of [...] "brush" [...] (such as soft or hard edge, procedural). Lastly, you add an ink, an example of which is image ink, where you paint an existing image onto a 3D model. Pressure-sensitive tablets are supported. The results of painting are stored in a bitmap and that map can be driving anything in Modo's <b>Shader</b> <b>Tree.</b> Thus you can paint into a map that is acting as a bump map and see the bumps in real-time in the viewport.|$|E
50|$|Phenomena {{consist of}} one or more <b>shader</b> <b>trees</b> (DAG). A {{phenomenon}} looks like regular shader to the user, and in fact may be a regular shader, but generally it will contain a link to a shader DAG, which may include the introduction or modification of geometry, introduction of lenses, environments, and compile options. The idea of a Phenomenon is to package elements and hide complexity.|$|R
