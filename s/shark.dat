5|$|As is {{the case}} for most Carcharhinus species, {{attempts}} to analyze the finetooth shark's phylogenetic relationships have yielded variable results. In 1988, Leonard Compagno grouped this species with the spinner <b>shark</b> (C. brevipinna), blacktip <b>shark</b> (C. limbatus), graceful <b>shark</b> (C. amblyrhynchoides), and smooth tooth blacktip <b>shark</b> (C. leiodon), on the basis of morphological characters. Gavin Naylor's 1992 allozyme analysis found that the finetooth <b>shark</b> is the second-most basal member of the genus next to the blacknose <b>shark</b> (C. acronotus). Mine Dosay-Akbulut's 2008 study, based on ribosomal DNA, suggested that the closest relative of the finetooth <b>shark</b> is the smalltail <b>shark</b> (C. porosus), and that the two species form a clade apart from other Carcharhinus species.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{morphological}} data, Jack Garrick {{suggested in}} 1982 that the blacknose <b>shark</b> has a sister relationship {{to a group}} containing the whitecheek <b>shark</b> (C. dussumieri) and the blackspot <b>shark</b> (C. sealei), while Leonard Compagno proposed in 1988 that this <b>shark</b> belongs in a group with five other species, including the silky <b>shark</b> (C. falciformis) and the blacktip reef <b>shark</b> (C. melanopterus). Molecular analyses have been similarly equivocal regarding the blacknose shark's phylogenetic relationships: Gavin Naylor's 1992 allozyme analysis found this species {{to be the most}} basal member of Carcharhinus, while Mine Dosay-Abkulut's 2008 ribosomal DNA analysis indicated affinity between it and the blacktip <b>shark</b> (C. limbatus) or the smalltail <b>shark</b> (C. porosus). The whitenose <b>shark</b> (Nasolamia velox), found along the tropical western coast of the Americas, may be descended from blacknose sharks that experienced the teratogenic effects of incipient cyclopia.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{morphological}} similarities, Jack Garrick in 1982 grouped {{this species}} with the bignose <b>shark</b> (C. altimus) and the sandbar <b>shark</b> (C. plumbeus), while Leonard Compagno in 1988 placed {{it as the}} sister species of the grey reef <b>shark</b> (C. amblyrhynchos). A phylogenetic analysis based on allozyme data, published by Gavin Naylor in 1992, indicated that the Caribbean reef <b>shark</b> is the sister taxon to a clade formed by the Galapagos <b>shark</b> (C. galapagensis), dusky <b>shark</b> (C. obscurus), oceanic whitetip <b>shark</b> (C. longimanus), and the blue <b>shark</b> (Prionace glauca). However, more work is required to fully resolve the interrelationships within Carcharhinus.|$|E

5|$|Based on morphology, Jack Garrick {{suggested}} in 1982 that the nervous <b>shark</b> {{is closely related}} to the blacktip reef <b>shark</b> (C. melanopterus). Leonard Compagno in 1988 tentatively grouped these two species with the blacknose <b>shark</b> (C. acronotus), the copper <b>shark</b> (C. brachyurus), the silky <b>shark</b> (C. falciformis), and the night <b>shark</b> (C. signatus). The close relationship between the nervous and blacktip reef sharks was upheld in a 1992 phylogenetic study by Shane Lavery, based on allozymes, and again in a 2011 study by Ximena Vélez-Zuazoa and Ingi Agnarsson, based on nuclear and mitochondrial genes.|$|E
5|$|Based on morphology, Leonard Compagno in 1988 {{tentatively}} grouped the smoothtooth blacktip <b>shark</b> {{with the}} spinner <b>shark</b> (C. brevipinna), the blacktip <b>shark</b> (C. limbatus), the graceful <b>shark</b> (C. amblyrhynchoides), and the finetooth <b>shark</b> (C. isodon). Using molecular phylogenetic techniques on mitochondrial DNA sequences, Alec Moore and colleagues reported in 2011 that this species {{is closely related}} to the graceful <b>shark,</b> the blacktip <b>shark,</b> and the Australian blacktip <b>shark</b> (C. tilstoni).|$|E
5|$|Based on {{similarities}} in morphology, tooth shape, and behavior, the closest {{relatives of the}} spinner <b>shark</b> were originally {{believed to be the}} blacktip <b>shark</b> and the graceful <b>shark</b> (C. amblyrhynchoides). However, this interpretation was not supported by Gavin Naylor's 1992 allozyme analysis, which suggested that these similarities are the product of convergent evolution and that the closest relative of the spinner <b>shark</b> is the copper <b>shark</b> (C. brachyurus). In a 2007 ribosomal DNA study, the spinner <b>shark</b> was found to be the most genetically divergent of all the requiem <b>shark</b> species examined save for the tiger <b>shark</b> (Galeocerdo cuvier), being less related to other Carcharhinus species than the lemon <b>shark</b> (Negaprion brevirostris).|$|E

Some species of rockfish (Sebastes) and sculpins (Comephoridae) produce rather weak larvae with no egg membrane and are also, by definition, ovoviviparous. Ovoviviparity occurs in most live-bearing bony fishes (Poeciliidae).|$|R
5|$|Dutch {{ichthyologist}} Pieter Bleeker {{first described}} the grey reef <b>shark</b> in 1856 as Carcharias (Prionodon) amblyrhynchos, {{in the scientific}} journal Natuurkundig Tijdschrift voor Nederlandsch-Indië.

50|$|During {{the same}} period 38 {{potentially}} aggressive <b>sharks</b> were also hooked, including tiger <b>sharks</b> (34) and bull <b>sharks</b> (4). The overall survival rate of potentially aggressive <b>sharks</b> was 70% (relocated and released).|$|R
5000|$|Like other fishes, <b>sharks</b> extract oxygen {{from water}} {{as it passes}} over their gills. The water enters through the mouth, passes into the pharynx, and exits through the gill slits (most <b>sharks</b> have five pairs, the frilled <b>sharks,</b> cow <b>sharks,</b> and sixgill sawshark have six or seven pairs). Most <b>sharks</b> also have an {{accessory}} respiratory opening called a spiracle behind their eyes. In bottom-dwelling <b>sharks</b> such as angel <b>sharks,</b> the spiracle allows them to take in water to breathe without having to open their mouths [...]|$|R
5|$|Many early sources {{gave the}} {{scientific}} {{name of the}} dusky <b>shark</b> as Carcharias (later Carcharhinus) lamiella, which originated from an 1882 account by David Starr Jordan and Charles Henry Gilbert. Although Jordan and Gilbert referred {{to a set of}} jaws that came from a dusky <b>shark,</b> the type specimen they designated was later discovered to be a copper <b>shark</b> (C. brachyurus). Therefore, C. lamiella is not considered a synonym of C. obscurus but rather of C. brachyurus. Other common names for this species include bay <b>shark,</b> black whaler, brown common gray <b>shark,</b> brown dusky <b>shark,</b> brown <b>shark,</b> common whaler, dusky ground <b>shark,</b> dusky whaler, river whaler, shovelnose, and slender whaler <b>shark.</b>|$|E
5|$|More recently, Gavin Naylor's 1992 phylogenetic analysis, {{based on}} {{allozyme}} sequence data, {{found that the}} silky <b>shark</b> {{is part of a}} group containing large sharks with a ridge between the dorsal fins. One branch within this group contains the sandbar <b>shark</b> (C.plumbeus) and the bignose <b>shark</b> (C.altimus), while the silky <b>shark</b> is the basal member of the other branch and the sister taxon to a clade containing the Caribbean reef <b>shark</b> (C.perezi), Galapagos <b>shark</b> (C.galapagensis), oceanic whitetip <b>shark</b> (C.longimanus), dusky <b>shark</b> (C.obscurus), and blue <b>shark</b> (Prionace glauca). Mine Dosay-Abkulut's 2008 ribosomal DNA analysis, which included the silky, blue, and bignose sharks, confirmed the closeness of those three species.|$|E
5|$|Spotted eagle rays, {{in common}} with many other rays, often fall victim to sharks such as the tiger <b>shark,</b> the lemon <b>shark,</b> the bull <b>shark,</b> the silver tip <b>shark,</b> and the great hammerhead <b>shark.</b> A great hammerhead <b>shark</b> has been {{observed}} attacking a spotted eagle ray in open water by taking a large bite {{out of one of}} its pectoral fins, thus incapacitating the ray. The <b>shark</b> then used its head to pin the ray to the bottom and pivoted to take the ray in its jaws, head first. Sharks have also been observed to follow female rays during the birthing season, and feed on the newborn pups.|$|E
25|$|Basking <b>sharks</b> {{have few}} predators. White <b>sharks</b> have been {{reported}} to scavenge on the remains of these <b>sharks.</b> Killer whales have been observed feeding on basking <b>sharks</b> off California and New Zealand.

50|$|The Bimini Biological Field Station has {{captured}} and recorded 13 species of <b>sharks</b> {{in the shallow}} waters around Bimini. However, the number of <b>sharks</b> around the island is even higher when considering the <b>sharks</b> of the deep waters off Bimini's western shores.

5|$|Subsequent authors {{moved the}} blacktip reef <b>shark</b> to the genus Carcharhinus; in 1965 the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature {{designated}} {{it as the}} type species for the genus. In some earlier literature, the scientific name of this <b>shark</b> was mistakenly given as C. spallanzani, now recognized as a synonym of the spottail <b>shark</b> (C. sorrah).

5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships of}} the Borneo <b>shark</b> are uncertain. Jack Garrick, in his 1982 morphological study, did not place {{it close to}} any other member of the genus.

5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships of}} the hardnose <b>shark</b> {{have not been}} fully resolved. In a 1988 study based on morphology, Leonard Compagno tentatively grouped the hardnose <b>shark</b> with the Borneo <b>shark</b> (C. borneensis), whitecheek <b>shark</b> (C. dussumieri), Pondicherry <b>shark</b> (C. hemiodon), creek whaler (C. fitzroyensis), smalltail <b>shark</b> (C. porosus), blackspot <b>shark</b> (C. sealei), and spottail <b>shark</b> (C. sorrah). Results from molecular phylogenetic analyses have been inconsistent, with some supporting parts of Compagno's hypothesis: a 1992 study could not resolve the hardnose shark's position in detail, a 2011 study reported that {{it was close to}} the clade formed by the whitecheek and blackspot sharks, and a 2012 study concluded that it was the sister species of the Borneo <b>shark.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{relationships of}} the smalltail <b>shark</b> are uncertain. Based on morphology, Jack Garrick in 1982 and Leonard Compagno in 1988 tentatively {{placed it in}} a group defined by the whitecheek <b>shark</b> (C. dussumieri) and the blackspot <b>shark</b> (C. sealei). This grouping was equivocally supported by Gavin Naylor's 1992 allozyme-based phylogenetic analysis. Alternately, a 2011 phylogenetic study by Ximena Vélez-Zuazoa and Ingi Agnarsson, based on nuclear and mitochondrial genes, found close relationships between the smalltail <b>shark,</b> the daggernose <b>shark</b> (Isogomphodon oxyrhynchus), the blacknose <b>shark</b> (C. acronotus), and the finetooth <b>shark</b> (C. isodon). The Pacific smalltail <b>shark</b> (C. cerdale) was once mistakenly synonymized with C. porosus, until 2011 when José Castro resurrected it as a distinct taxon.
