For example, Victoria School gives its students the option to exclude applicable subjects from the GPA computation depending on the <b>subject</b> <b>combination</b> of the student. This GPA value is rounded to two decimal places, giving the student's GPA. A minimum GPA of 2.0 will usually be required for promotion.

He was elected General Secretary at G P College Kishtwar and later contested election for the post of District President of NSUI Kishtwar and won the post of District President by the organizational election in State President NSUI Jammu and Kashmir Neeraj Kundan’s committee in 2014.

3000|$|Worse, in {{a country}} where {{creation}} of jobs should be top on the list of priorities, the current policy in the Ministry of Education renders B.Ed. (Arts) graduates whose <b>subject</b> <b>combination</b> is English and Literature unemployable. The {{truth of the matter is}} that the private sector is profit-driven. Teachers whose <b>subject</b> <b>combination</b> is English and Literature are not economically viable. Since English Language and Literature in English are now [...] "integrated", these teachers have only one teaching subject. In their place are hired B.A. graduates who have combined either English Language or Literature in English with another subject. Since the Teachers' Service Commission (TSC) does not hire teachers without at least four years' teaching experience, a vicious cycle ensues. The result of the poor mastery of Language (any language) in Kenya is also manifest in the level of creative output (see Figure 1).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the attitudes held by pre-service chemistry student teachers. A survey was conducted on Egerton University students in the 2002 / 2003 academic year. The sample included all the Bachelor of Education (Science) pre-service chemistry students. These students had just covered the Chemistry Subject Methods course and were about to start their teaching practice programme. The sample consisted of 71 male and 34 female student teachers, making a total of 105 respondents. A modified Chemistry Teachersâ€™ Attitudes Questionnaire (CTAQ) for measuring chemistry teachersâ€™ attitudes towards teaching was developed and used for data collection. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, t-test and Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The results show that pre-service chemistry student teachers have high positive attitudes towards teaching. Student teachersâ€™ gender and <b>subject</b> <b>combination</b> have no influence on their attitudes towards chemistry teaching.
