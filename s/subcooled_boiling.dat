40|$|In {{relation}} to the formulation of one-dimensional interfacial area transport equation in a <b>subcooled</b> <b>boiling</b> flow, the bubble-layer thickness model was introduced to avoid many covariances in crosssectional averaged interfacial area transport equation in the <b>subcooled</b> <b>boiling</b> flow. The one dimensional interfacial area transport equation in the <b>subcooled</b> <b>boiling</b> flow was formulated by partitioning a flow region into two regions; boiling two-phase (bubble-layer) region and liquid singlephase region. The bubble-layer thickness model assuming the square void peak in the bubble-layer region was developed to predict the bubble-layer thickness of the <b>subcooled</b> <b>boiling</b> flow. The obtained model was evaluated by void fraction profile measured in an internally heated annulus. It was shown that the bubble-layer thickness model {{could be applied to}} predict the bubble-layer thickness as well as the void fraction profile. In addition, the constitutive equation for the distribution parameter of the boiling flow in the internally heated annulus, which was used for formulating the bubble-layer thickness model, was developed based on the measured data.

Three major types of CHF flow regimes were identified (bubbly, vapor clot and slug flow regime) and a CHF flow regime map was developed, based on a dimensional analysis of the phenomena and available experimental information.

40|$|Increasing {{demand for}} energy necessitates nuclear power units to {{increase}} power limits. This implies {{significant changes in}} the design of the core of the nuclear power units, therefore providing better performance and safety in operations. A major hindrance to the increase of nuclear reactor performance especially in Pressurized Deionized water Reactors (PWR) is Axial Offset Anomaly (AOA) [...] the unexpected change in the core axial power distribution during operation from the predicted distribution. This problem is thought to be occur because of precipitation and deposition of lithiated compounds like boric acid (H{sub 2 }BO{sub 3 }) and lithium metaborate (LiBO{sub 2 }) on the fuel rod cladding. Deposited boron absorbs neutrons thereby affecting the total power distribution inside the reactor. AOA is thought to occur when there is sufficient build-up of crud deposits on the cladding during <b>subcooled</b> nucleate <b>boiling.</b> Predicting AOA is difficult as there is very little information regarding the heat and mass transfer during <b>subcooled</b> nucleate <b>boiling.</b> An experimental investigation was conducted to study the heat transfer characteristics during <b>subcooled</b> nucleate <b>boiling</b> at prototypical PWR conditions. Pool boiling tests were conducted with varying concentrations of lithium metaborate (LiBO{sub 2 }) and boric acid (H{sub 2 }BO{sub 3 }) solutions in deionized water. The experimental data collected includes the effect of coolant concentration, subcooling, system pressure and heat flux on pool the boiling heat transfer coefficient. The analysis of particulate deposits formed on the fuel cladding surface during <b>subcooled</b> nucleate <b>boiling</b> was also performed.

Boiling tests also revealed the formation of fine deposits of boron and lithium on the cladding surface which degraded the heat transfer rates.

40|$|As the {{operating}} {{conditions of the}} pressurized water reactor (PWR) have been increased towards the thermal limits of the core for economics, the <b>subcooled</b> <b>boiling</b> heat transfer performance of the rod bundles under normal operating conditions has become an increasingly important design focus. Effective field models such as two-fluid model, on which most previous numerical studies in the nuclear fields have focused, cannot predict detailed phenomenon of <b>subcooled</b> <b>boiling</b> because it involves complex multiphase dynamics, such as nucleation, growth, detachment bubbles from a wall, deformation, break-up, coalescence, and condensation. It also requires numerous, additional closure relations. On the other hand, direct numerical simulations with interfacial tracking enable us to capture specific two-phase flow and do not require additional empirical closure relations. In this thesis, we simulate isothermal, two-dimensional bubble dynamics {{as a starting point}} toward direct simulation of the <b>subcooled</b> <b>boiling.</b> We adopt a lattice Boltzmann method with the phase-field model. The lattice Boltzmann method is a mesoscopic approach well-adapted to the simulation of complex fluids and is simple to implement. The phase field model can capture complex topological deformation, such as coalescence and break-up, with better numerical stability than other interfacial tracking methods like Volume of Fluid (VOF) and level set methods. We validate the present method for stationary and moving two-phase interfaces by comparing with theoretical solutions for a single static bubble in a stationary liquid and a capillary wave, respectively. In addition, the capability of the current method to simulate the coalescence of two bubbles and droplets is validated by comparing with experimental data. To see the applicability of the method to problems involving complex bubble behaviors and interactions with a high-density ratio as in <b>subcooled</b> <b>boiling</b> water, we simulate rising single and double bubbles in a viscous fluid. For a single bubble problem, the bubble shapes and terminal velocity agreed well with the experimental results for different fluid dynamic conditions. For a double bubble case, the current method can capture the interaction and dynamics of the bubbles. Thus, it is expected that this study can serve as a stepping-stone extension to convective <b>subcooled</b> <b>boiling</b> heat transfer in the nuclear reactor core...|$|E
40|$|Axial {{developments}} of the local void fraction, interfacial area concentration and bubble Sauter mean diameter were measured in <b>subcooled</b> <b>boiling</b> flow of water in a vertical internally heated annulus using the double-sensor conductivity probe technique. Measurements were performed under varying conditions of heat flux, inlet liquid velocity and inlet liquid temperature. A total of 10 data sets were acquired. Based on these measurements with the previous data obtained in the present test loop, the influence of flow condition on the profiles of local two-phase flow parameters was discussed. The measured average void fraction and interfacial area concentration were compared with the predictions by existing correlations for drift-flux parameters and interfacial area concentration. Also, the recently proposed bubble layer thickness model in <b>subcooled</b> <b>boiling</b> was evaluated for the measurement data...|$|E
40|$|The {{critical}} {{heat flux}} (CHF) mechanisum is considered tightly connected to the flow pattern. According to the most often-encountered sbcooled boiling flow pattern (the first kind of flow pattern), a new mechanistic CHF model is developed for vertical <b>subcooled</b> flow <b>boiling.</b> The model {{is based on the}} liquid sublayer dryout mechanism. The model is simple with explicit physics meaning, and is characterized by the absence of empirical constant. The model is tested over a very large data bank, showing a general good accuracy. The model is compared to the Celata model in the predivtion ability for the CHF and important parameters (UB, LB, DB, δ). Although the prediction approaches of the two models differ greatly, it is interesting to see that the important parameters are predicted with no big difference existing. The parametric trends of the CHF are summarized and interpreted in the paper from the model theory viewpoint. The CHF is an increasing function of the coolant subcooling and mass flux. The influence of the pressure on the CHF turns out to be negligible. ･･･Thesis (Ph.

30|$|Although most CHF {{experiments}} with nanofluids {{have been carried}} out under pool-boiling conditions, there have been a very limited number of CHF studies in forced convection condition. A group at MIT (USA) reported {{for the first time that}} nanofluids can significantly enhance the CHF under <b>subcooled</b> flow <b>boiling</b> conditions [37, 38]. They conducted <b>subcooled</b> flow <b>boiling</b> experiments in a stainless steel tube with an internal diameter of 8.7 mm at a pressure of 0.1 MPa for three different mass fluxes (1, 500, 2, 000, and 2, 500 kg/m 2 s). The maximum CHF enhancements were 53 %, 53 %, and 38 % for nanofluids with alumina, zinc oxide, and diamond, respectively, all obtained at the highest mass flux. Kim et al. [39] performed similar flow boiling CHF experiments in a stainless steel tube with an internal diameter of 10.98 mm at relatively low mass fluxes ranging from 100 to 300 kg/m 2 s and inlet subcooling temperatures of 25 °C and 50 °C. The results for alumina nanofluids confirmed a significant flow boiling CHF enhancement of up to about 70 % under all experimental conditions.|$|R
40|$|Mixtures of {{ethylene}} glycol and water {{are employed in}} cooling engines in automotive applications. To avoid two-phase flow in the engine, the mixture is subcooled in the radiator before entering the engine block. Heat transfer is therefore essentially under <b>subcooled</b> flow <b>boiling</b> conditions. Very little information {{is available in the}} literature on the <b>subcooled</b> flow <b>boiling</b> (flow <b>boiling</b> with <b>subcooled</b> liquid) characteristics of this mixture and there are no predictive methods established in this region. In the present investigation heat transfer in the nucleate flow boiling of dilute aqueous binary mixtures was measured and experimental data were compared with available correlating methods developed for binary mixtures. The concentration range from pure water to 40 percent {{ethylene glycol}} solution is tested under these conditions. Eighteen different concentrations have been investigated. Liquids were boiled at atmospheric pressure on a rectangular flow channel. The experimental set up consists of a 9. 5 mm circular heater placed on the lower wall of a 3 mm x 40 mm horizontal channel. The results indicate that increasing the concentration of ethylene-glycol in water deteriorates the heat transfer coefficients as compared to the case of pure water at the same wall superheat...|$|R
