40|$|Purpose: <b>Seam</b> <b>welds</b> {{occur during}} the hollow profile extrusion; the billet’s {{material}} {{is divided into}} separate metal streams by the bridges of the die which support a mandrel, and then these metal streams are welded in welding chamber behind the bridges. When the desired conditions have not been provided, the required quality in <b>seam</b> <b>welds</b> may not occur. One of the possible reasons for this situation is a poor metal feed. In this study, an insufficient pressure problem occurring in <b>seam</b> <b>welds</b> on an aluminum extrusion profile section is investigated. Design/methodology/approach: The study was realized on a hollow extrusion profile type which has <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> zones. The experimental profile was produced by a real extrusion press which has a capacity of 1460 tones. Findings: The poor metal feed occurring on specimen is shown by microstructural pictures. Microstructure of the main region has a homogenous appearance. In the microstructure, containing <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> region, only a slight change was observed in <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> region. However, {{there was no significant}} change in near of <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> regions. This points out that there has been no metallurgical problem. Therefore, the problem is an insufficient pressure problem and this caused poor metal feeding. In the other hand, micro hardness tests are realized on <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> region, main region and defective region’s surround of specimen’s section. After the micro hardness tests important differences are shown among these regions’ strength. Hardness values of <b>seam</b> <b>weld</b> region were lower than the main material’s hardness values, but higher than the defective region’s. Practical implications: In application, <b>seam</b> <b>welds</b> occur on hollow profiles produced by aluminum extrusion.

It describes the <b>seam</b> <b>welding</b> of multi-layered similar and dissimilar metallic sheets. The method described and involved advancing a rotating non-consumable rod (CP Mo or AISI 304) toward the upper sheet of a metallic stack clamped under pressure. As soon as the distal end of the rod touched the top portion of the upper metallic sheet, an axial force was applied. After an initial dwell time, the metallic stack moved horizontally relative to the stationery non-consumable rod by a desired length, thereby forming a metallurgical bond between the metallic sheets. Multi-track and multi-metal <b>seam</b> <b>welds</b> of high temperature metallic sheets, AISI 304, C-Mn steel, Nickel-based alloys, Cp Cu, Ti 6 Al 4 V and low temperature metallic sheets, AA 6061 were obtained.

Tensile- shear testing showed that the <b>seam</b> <b>welds</b> of AISI 304, C-Mn steel, Nickel-based alloy were stronger than the starting base metal counterparts while AA 6061 was weaker due to softening. The metallurgical bonding at the interface between the metallic sheets was attributed to localized stick and slip at the interface, dynamic recrystallization and diffusion.

40|$|Human and Systems EngineeringLaser welding is an {{emerging}} joining technique for automotive industry. Due {{to the complex}} process, the control of laser welding quality problem such as spatter, porosity, and undercut is not easy. Traditional mechanical testing of weld is time consuming, costly, and inefficient for on-line monitoring of laser welding quality. In this regards, this thesis aims to estimate the laser welding quality in a non-destructive way by using the geometry of top <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> of weldment. The most challenging task which is covered in this thesis is the estimation of the tensile shear strength in a non-destructive way. Experimental analysis reveals {{that the existence of}} two types of correlation in the variation of <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and tensile shear strength in the laser welding of galvanized steel: (1) positive correlation exists between the log-transformed average width of the top <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and maximum tensile shear strength, and (2) negative correlation exists between the variation of the width of top <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> and maximum tensile shear strength.

40|$|Longitudinal <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> are an {{intrinsic}} feature in hollow extrusions produced with porthole dies. The formation of longitudinal <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> {{is a solid}} bonding process, controlled by the local conditions in the extrusion die. Being the weakest areas within the extrusion cross section, it is desirable to achieve adequate properties of these <b>weld</b> <b>seams.</b> In our research, {{the concept of a}} <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> integrity indicator as a means of quantifying bonding efficiency is introduced. The value of this indicator depends on a number of factors: the material flow within the die weld chambers, an adequate pressure level acting on the weld planes and finally the evolution of the metal microstructure. Optimisation of the welding conditions leads to a higher value of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> integrity indicator and thus to improved <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> properties. The objective of the research presented in this paper is to assess the feasibility of this concept. In lab-scale experiments, AA 6060 and AA 6082 aluminium alloy billets were formed into strips by means of the direct hot extrusion process. By utilising porthole dies a central longitudinal <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> is formed. The effect of different geometries of the weld chamber and the processing conditions {{on the quality of the}} <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> are investigated. Characterisation of these <b>weld</b> <b>seams</b> through mechanical testing, focusing on the ability of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> area to accommodate plastic deformation following the onset of plastic instability, and microstructural analysis provides insight into bonding performance. The outcome of this characterisation provides a basis for an estimation of the <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> indicator. Through computer modelling, the particular process conditions related to <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> formation are calculated and correlated with the experimental results. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that <b>weld</b> <b>seam</b> formation is controlled by a combination of factors as described above.
