5|$|From 1984 to 1991 the sindicatos {{embarked}} {{on a series of}} protests against the forced eradication of coca by occupying local government offices, setting up roadblocks, going on hunger strike, and organizing mass marches and demonstrations. Morales was personally involved in this direct activism and in 1984 was present at a roadblock where 3 campesinos were killed. In 1988, Morales was elected to the position of Executive Secretary of the Federation of the Tropics. In 1989 he spoke at a one-year commemoratory event of the Villa Tunari massacre in which 11 coca farmers had been killed by agents of the Rural Area Mobile Patrol Unit (Unidad Móvil Policial para Áreas Rurales – UMOPAR). The following day, UMOPAR agents beat Morales up, leaving him in the mountains to die, but he was rescued by other union members. To combat this violence, Morales concluded that an armed cocalero militia could launch a guerrilla war against the government, but he was soon persuaded on an electoral path to change instead. In 1992, he made various international trips to champion the cocalero cause, <b>speaking</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> conference in Cuba, and also traveling to Canada, during which he learned of his mother's death.|$|E

5|$|In October 2004, Tony Blair {{announced}} he would not lead the party into a fourth general election, but would serve a full third term. Political comment over the relationship between Brown and Blair continued up to and beyond the 2005 election, which Labour won with a reduced majority and reduced vote share. Blair announced on 7 September 2006 that he would step down within a year. Brown was the clear favourite to succeed Blair; {{he was the only}} candidate spoken of seriously in Westminster. Appearances and news coverage leading up to the handover were interpreted as preparing the ground for Brown to become Prime Minister, in part by creating the impression of a statesman with a vision for leadership and global change. This enabled Brown to signal the most significant priorities for his agenda as Prime Minister; <b>speaking</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> Fabian Society conference on 'The Next Decade' in January 2007, he stressed education, international development, narrowing inequalities (to pursue 'equality of opportunity and fairness of outcome'), renewing Britishness, restoring trust in politics, and winning hearts and minds {{in the war on terror}} as key priorities.|$|E

25|$|<b>Speaking</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> {{string theory}} conference in 1995, Edward Witten made the {{surprising}} suggestion that all five superstring theories {{were in fact}} just different limiting cases of a single theory in eleven spacetime dimensions.

In the months following Witten's announcement, hundreds of new papers appeared on the Internet confirming different parts of his proposal. Today this flurry of work is known as the second superstring revolution.|$|E

And that is exactly what these closures are going to do – oh, not intentionally, except in a few cases; very few people are stupid intentionally; but that will be the effect. Books will be harder to get at. Stupidity will gain a little ground.|$|E

25|$|Regarding Crimea's borders, {{the head}} of Russian Federal Agency for the Development of the State Border Facilities (Rosgranitsa) Konstantin Busygin, who was <b>speaking</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> meeting led by Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin in Simferopol, the capital of Crimea said the Russian state border {{in the north of}} Crimea which, {{according}} to his claims, now forms part of the Russian-Ukrainian border, will be fully equipped with the necessary facilities.

On early June that year Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev signed a Government resolution №961 dated 5 June 2014 establishing air, sea, road and railway checkpoints.

25|$|The {{parents of}} Igor Suprunyuk and Viktor Sayenko {{repeated}} {{their belief in}} the innocence of their sons. Vladimir Suprunyuk claimed that Igor had been tortured to extract his confession, with the police covering his head and forcing him to inhale cigarette smoke. <b>Speaking</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> televised press conference, he cited irregularities in the investigation, {{and said that the}} case against his son was false. Viktor Sayenko claimed that his son was a scapegoat, and that the crimes were committed by relatives of senior officials. The parents plan to appeal to the Supreme Court of Ukraine and the European Court of Human Rights. The parents of Suprunyuk and Sayenko also argued that the sentence on Alexander Hanzha was too lenient. An opinion poll conducted in Dnepropetrovsk found that 50.3% of people believed that the sentence was fair, and 48.6% believed that the sentence should have been more severe. In April 2011, a poll found that nearly 60% of Ukrainians wanted the death penalty available for serial killings where judicial error had been ruled out.|$|E
25|$|In 1851, she met Elizabeth Cady Stanton, {{who became}} her lifelong friend and co-worker in social reform activities, {{primarily}} {{in the field of}} women's rights. In 1852, they founded the New York Women's State Temperance Society after Anthony was prevented from <b>speaking</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> temperance conference because she was female. In 1863, they founded the Women's Loyal National League, which conducted the largest petition drive in United States history up to that time, collecting nearly 400,000 signatures in support of the abolition of slavery. In 1866, they initiated the American Equal Rights Association, which campaigned for equal rights for both women and African Americans. In 1868, they began publishing a women's rights newspaper called The Revolution. In 1869, they founded the National Woman Suffrage Association as part of a split in the women's movement. In 1890, the split was formally healed when their organization merged with the rival American Woman Suffrage Association to form the National American Woman Suffrage Association, with Anthony as its key force. In 1876, Anthony and Stanton began working with Matilda Joslyn Gage on what eventually grew into the six-volume History of Woman Suffrage. The interests of Anthony and Stanton diverged somewhat in later years, but the two remained close friends.|$|E
