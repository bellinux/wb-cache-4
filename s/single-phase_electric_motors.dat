40|$|Manual depodding of melon pods for {{the purpose}} of extracting the edible seeds is a time {{consuming}} and tedious operation. A melon depodding machine was therefore designed, fabricated and evaluated for performance. The major components of the machine are the frame, hopper, depodding chamber and discharge outlet. The machine is powered by a 1. 5 kW, 1420 rpm <b>single-phase</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> All materials used for fabricating the components were sourced locally. The performance characteristics of the machine, including Depodding Efficiency, Material Discharge Efficiency (product of Seed Discharge Efficiency and Pulp Discharge Efficiency) and Overall Efficiency, were evaluated at six operating speeds (200 rpm, 250 rpm, 300 rpm, 350 rpm, 367 rpm and 400 rpm) and one clearance setting (10 mm) between the spiked-screw conveyor and the cylinder wall. The Depodding Efficiency varies between 31. 8 % and 62. 1 % while Seed Discharge Efficiency varies between 29. 7 % and 74. 4 %.

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 A {{relatively}} new {{development in the}} electric machines field has been the written-pole technology, of which the latest product is the large <b>single-phase</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor,</b> the single phase Written-Pole Motor (WPM). The WPM is a synchronous, permanent-magnet single-phase motor having a weak rotor cage for start-up which in addition exhibits significant hysteresis effects at speeds below or above true synchronism. The electrical configuration of the WPM places it in the capacitor-start capacitor-run category of single-phase motors, due to the large size and need for an approximation of a round rather than elliptic rotating magnetic field. This thesis {{presents the results of}} the research conducted by the author in the Motor Systems Resource Facility (MSRF) of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Oregon State University. The thesis is structured into two main parts: Testing and Modeling. The tests conducted on the WPM were trying to independently verify manufacturer's claims with regards to efficiency, power factor, robustness, power-outage ride-through and furthermore to study the behaviour of the machine during voltage sags, overvoltages and undervoltages. Tests were conducting in order to develop a mathematical model from which the performance of the machine can be predicted. The modeling efforts were concentrated {{in the development of a}} comprehensive model which would include all three major aspects of the WPM, and the performance of the resulting model was compared with the sampled data...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{small scale}} {{sugarcane}} juice extractor using a screw pressing system was designed, constructed and tested. Consideration {{was given to}} the techno-economic status of the micro and small scale sugarcane farmers and juice processors who are the intended users of the machine. The functional parts of the machine included grating unit, extraction unit, prime mover, pulley, transmission belts, bearings and frame. The machine was tested with two varieties of sugarcane each at three levels of moisture content and results showed that average grating efficiency and juice yield of 87. 8 % and 2. 5 % respectively were obtained. Powered by a 3 hp <b>single-phase</b> <b>electric</b> <b>motor,</b> the machine was constructed with materials being available locally at affordable costs. A cottage sugarcane juice extraction plant based on this technology could provide employment {{and at the same time}} produce sugarcane juice and bagasse at low costs for sugar and biofuel industries. An improvement in the design, analysis and optimization of the worm shaft and press cage is expected to improve the juice yield and extraction efficiency; hence, this is highly recommended.

40|$|Nowadays {{the work}} is in {{progress}} to develop wheeled and caterpillar tractors with electromechanical transmission. Range of changes in transmission gear ratio while using propulsion <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> depends on mechanical characteristics of a tractor propulsion <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> which is equipped with electromechanical transmission. In case when the range is rather high then {{it is possible to}} minimize number of gearings in the tractor gearing box or exclude its usage at all. Type of the applied propulsion <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> and regulation method specify type of mechanical characteristics (characteristics family) of the propulsion <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> The paper considers a propulsion asynchronous <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> with frequency control. While using frequency control it is possible to regulate <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> revolutions by mutual changes in voltage and voltage frequency. There are various laws of mutual changes in voltage and frequency (regulation laws). Selection of a regulation law influences on type of mechanical characteristics of a propulsion <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> Application of any law can be admissible only for some specific range of voltage frequency otherwise it is possible to exceed some parameters (for example, admissible voltage in the winding of <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> stator). It is necessary to ensure the required moment within wide range for a tractor propulsion <b>electric</b> <b>motor.</b> In this case losses in the <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> must be minimal. Losses in the rotor of the propulsion asynchronous <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> are directly proportional to its sliding and its best propulsion and mechanical properties of a mobile machine will be ensured in the case when sliding is preserved at a constant value. According to these reasons selection of regulation laws has been carried out for operation of the propulsion asynchronous <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> with nominal sliding and mechanical characteristics at nominal sliding is conventionally called a nominal characteristics. The paper analyzes the possible laws of mutual application of voltage and voltage frequency and their application boundaries. A combination of laws for regulation of the propulsion asynchronous <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> has been selected in the paper. The combination ensures the widest operational range of the <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> with high moment value at nominal sliding and due account of limitations on application of every used regulation law. The following mechanical characteristics family has been constructed for the propulsion asynchronous <b>electric</b> <b>motor</b> regulated in accordance with the proposed law: at nominal sliding, at critical sliding, at changeable sliding and without changes in voltage and frequency. </p...|$|R
