Very few data on the genetic structure of such SFVs found in humans are available. In the framework of ongoing studies searching for SFV-infected humans in south Cameroon rainforest villages, we studied 38 SFV-infected hunters whose times of infection had presumably been determined. By long-term cocultures of peripheral bloodmononuclear cells with BHK- 21 cells, we isolated five new SFV strains and obtained complete genomes of SFV strains from chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes; strains BAD 327 and AG 15), monkey (Cercopithecus nictitans; strain AG 16), and gorilla (Gorilla gorilla; strains BAK 74 and BAD 468). These zoonotic strains share a very high degree of similarity with their NHP counterparts and have {{a high degree of}} conservation of the genetic elements important for viral replication. Interestingly, analysis of FV DNA sequences ob-tained before cultivation revealed variants with deletions in both the U 3 region and tas that may correlate with in vivo chronicity in humans. Genomic changes in bet (a premature stop codon) and gagwere also observed. To determine if such changes were specific to zoonotic strains, we studied local SFV-infected chimpanzees and found the same genomic changes. Our study reveals that natural polymorphism of SFV strains does exist at both the intersubspecies level (gag, bet) and the intrasubspecies (U 3, tas) levels but does not seem to reflect a viral adaptation specific to zoonotic SFV strains. <b>Simian</b> <b>foamy</b> <b>viruses</b> (SFVs) are exogenous complex retrovi-ruses of the Spumaretrovirinae subfamily (15).

5000|$|The first {{description}} of foamy virus (FV) was in 1954. It was found as a contaminant in primary monkey kidney cultures. The first isolate of the “foamy viral agent” was in 1955. Not too long after this, it was isolated {{from a wide}} variety of New and Old World monkeys, cats, and cows. It was not until several years later that humans entered the scene. In 1971, a viral agent with FV-like characteristics was isolated from lymphoblastoid cells released from a human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) from a Kenyan patient. [...] The agent was termed a human FV because of its origin, and named SFVcpz(hu) as the prototypic laboratory stain. The SFV came from its similarity to <b>simian</b> <b>foamy</b> <b>virus</b> (SFV). Not long after this, a group of researchers concluded that it was a distinct type of FV and most closely related to SFV types 6 and 7, both of which were isolated from chimpanzees. In another report, however, a different group of researchers claimed that SFVcpz(hu) was not a distinct type of FV but rather a variant strain of chimpanzee FV. The debate came to an end in 1994 when the virus was cloned and sequenced. The sequencing showed that there are 86-95% identical amino acids between the SFV and the one isolated from the Kenyan patient. In addition, phylogenetic analysis showed that the pol regions of the two genomes shared 89-92% of their nucleotides and 95-97% of the amino acids are identical between the human virus and various SFV strains. These results indicated that SFVcpz(hu) is likely a variant of SFV and not a unique isolate. When looking at the origin of the human FV, sequence comparisons showed that from four different species of chimpanzees, SFVcpz(hu) was most closely related to Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii. This species of chimpanzee has a natural habitat in Kenya and thus, the origin of the variant was most likely this species, and the virus was probably acquired as a zoonotic infection.|$|E

We aimed at studying {{the natural history of}} SFV infection in human. We have analyzed viral load and gene expression in 14 hunters from Cameroon previously shown to be infected with a gorilla SFV strain. Viral DNA could be detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR) targeting the pol-in region, in most samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (7. 1 ± 6. 0 SFV DNA copies/ 105 PBMCs) and saliva (2. 4 ± 4. 3 SFV DNA copies/ 105 cells) derived from the hunters. However, quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT) -qPCR revealed the absence of SFV viral gene expression in both PBMCs and saliva, suggesting that SFV was latent in the human samples. Our study demonstrates that a latent infection can occur in humans and persist for years, both in PBMCs and saliva. Such a scenario may contribute to the putative lack of secondary human-to-human transmissions of SFV...|$|R
