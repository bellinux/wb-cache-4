50|$|Many {{irrigation}} sprinklers {{are buried}} in the ground along with their supporting plumbing, although above ground and moving sprinklers are also common. Most irrigation sprinklers operate through electric and hydraulic technology and are grouped together in zones that can be collectively turned on and off by actuating a <b>solenoid-controlled</b> valve.|$|E

5000|$|From 1991, the GSF400V {{received}} variable inlet timing via <b>solenoid-controlled</b> {{rocker arm}} engaging with supplementary cams. Although these models are {{commonly referred to}} as [...] "GSF400V-V", the '-V' actually denotes the 1997 Suzuki model year motorcycles. VVT models are usually recognised by a red engine cover and some instances of a light grey engine cover. The GSF250V arrived later, in 1995.|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to fully electropneumatic marker designs, electronic trigger frames, with a <b>solenoid-controlled</b> sear, can be fit to most mechanical [...] "blow-back" [...] designs, {{such as the}} Kingman Spyder line of entry-level markers. These allow the high rates of fire seen in full electropneumatic designs at a very low cost compared to higher-level markers; however they typically have both the higher recoil of poppets (even worse, typically, as the designs use a traditional high-mass hammer driven forward by a spring) and relatively low gas efficiency due to a single operating pressure.|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic {{solenoid valves}} are in general similar to {{pneumatic}} solenoid valves {{except that they}} control the flow of hydraulic fluid (oil), often at around 3000 psi (210 bar, 21 MPa, 21 MN/mÂ²). Hydraulic machinery uses solenoids to control the flow of oil to rams or actuators. <b>Solenoid-controlled</b> valves are often used in irrigation systems, where a relatively weak solenoid opens and closes a small pilot valve, which in turn activates the main valve by applying fluid pressure to a piston or diaphragm that is mechanically coupled to the main valve.Solenoids are also in everyday household items such as washing machines to control the flow and amount of water into the drum.|$|E
50|$|The {{price point}} of the VO series was {{oriented}} toward educational, corporate and industrial fields, featured unbalanced audio connectors, and did not typically include SMPTE time code (although one or two companies offered after-market modification services to install longitudinal time code). The VO-3800 was largely metal, which made the unit heavy, but still technically portable. The VO-4800 had the same functionality as the VO-3800, but at a greatly reduced weight and size, by replacing many components with plastic. The VO-6800 added the improvement of a long, thin battery standard ("candy bars") that permitted storage of the batteries in a trouser pocket. Common model numbers for these batteries were NP-1, NP-1A and NP-1B. The VO-8800 {{was the last of}} the portable VO series to be produced by Sony, and featured <b>solenoid-controlled</b> transport.|$|E
50|$|There are {{currently}} two main types of cylinder deactivation used today, {{depending on the}} type of engine. The first is for the pushrod design which uses solenoids to alter the oil pressure delivered to the lifters. In their collapsed state, the lifters are unable to elevate their companion pushrods under the valve rocker arms, resulting in valves that cannot be actuated and remain closed. The second is used for overhead cam engines, and uses a pair of locked-together rocker arms that are employed for each valve. One rocker follows the cam profile, while the other actuates the valve. When a cylinder is deactivated, <b>solenoid-controlled</b> oil pressure releases a locking pin between the two rocker arms. While one arm still follows the camshaft, the unlocked arm remains motionless and unable to activate the valve.|$|E
5000|$|By {{the turn}} of the century, with the advent and {{increased}} popularity of electropneumatics, it no longer became profitable for specialized shops to produce custom autocockers, and they slowly began to disappear. Though the introduction of partial-electropneumatic conversion kits in the early 2000s by companies like Planet Eclipse extended the autocockers' popularity by a few more years, the availability of fully electropneumatic markers that required less work to maintain caused the autococker to lose favor with tournament teams, and eventually, casual players as well. Newer Autocockers with integrated, <b>solenoid-controlled</b> pneumatics remain available, boasting lesser maintenance and tuning. [...] "Classic" [...] Autococker models retain some popularity with recreational players, some of whom [...] "revert" [...] the design back to the pump-action [...] "Sniper" [...] concept for use in pump play.|$|E
50|$|In {{electromagnetic}} designs, the trigger, {{instead of}} being mechanically linked to {{the action of the}} marker, simply activates an electronic micro-switch (or more recently, a magnetic or optical sensor). That information is passed through control circuitry to a computer-controlled solenoid valve which can open and close very quickly and precisely, allowing gas to move into or out of various pressure chambers in the marker to move the bolt and fire the paintball. This disconnect of the trigger from the action allows electronic trigger pulls to be very short in length and very lightweight (similar to a mouse click; the mechanisms are virtually identical), which dramatically increases rate-of-fire over a fully mechanical design. <b>Solenoid-controlled</b> gas valve designs also allow for reduced weight of internal parts, which both lightens overall weight and reduces the time it takes for the marker to cycle through firing a single paintball.|$|E
5000|$|The {{centerpiece}} of the playfield is an animated castle with a <b>solenoid-controlled</b> portcullis and motorized drawbridge. One of the game's primary objectives is to [...] "destroy" [...] six castles by hitting the castle's entryway with the pinball. A specific number of hits will lower the drawbridge, exposing the portcullis; additional hits will cause the portcullis to rise, and shooting {{the ball into the}} castle entrance generates an explosion effect on the dot matrix display, a lightshow, and a sizable award of points. Medieval Madness also features two Trolls, animated targets that are normally concealed below the playfield, but can pop up during certain gameplay modes. Other objectives can be scored by shooting the left and right ramps, the left and right orbits, and the catapult ramp in the lower left corner of the playfield. The game's ramps introduced a patented feature that would prevent a failed ramp shot from draining straight down the middle between the flippers.|$|E
5000|$|The Quadrajet is a [...] "spread bore" [...] carburetor; {{the primary}} {{venturis}} are {{much smaller than}} the secondary venturis. By comparison, a [...] "square bore" [...] carburetor has primary and secondary venturis of similar size. Most Quadrajets were capable of 750 ft3 L/min (cfm) maximum, but some rare Buick and Pontiac models were capable of 800 ft3 L/min for use on high performance engines, and most 1984-1987 pickup trucks were also equipped with the 800-cfm carb. Most Quadrajets use a vacuum operated piston to move the primary metering rods to control the air-fuel ratio, allowing the mixture to be lean under low load conditions and rich during high load conditions. A less-common version uses a linkage driven off the primary throttle shaft to mechanically move the power piston. [...] "E" [...] (electronic control module controlled) series of Quadrajets use a computer controlled mixture control solenoid that responds to electronic signals from the throttle position and oxygen sensors via the computer, ideal for precise fuel metering and allowing additional fuel under load. The <b>solenoid-controlled</b> metering rods allow the fuel mixture to be very close to optimum, then the solenoid is pulse width modulated at about 6 Hz to fine-tune the air fuel ratio under closed loop conditions. The electronic versions have a throttle position sensor that is mounted inside the carburetor body, actuated by the accelerator pump lever.|$|E
50|$|Reverse (R): This engages {{reverse gear}} within the transmission, {{permitting}} {{the vehicle to}} be driven backward, and operates a switch {{to turn on the}} white backup lights for improved visibility (the switch may also activate a beeper on delivery trucks or other large vehicles to audibly warn other drivers and nearby pedestrians of the driver's reverse movement). To select reverse in most transmissions, the driver must come to a complete stop, depress the shift-lock button (or move the shift lever toward the driver in a column shifter, or move the shifter sideways along a notched channel in a console shifter) and select reverse. The driver should avoid engaging reverse while the vehicle is moving forwards, and likewise avoid engaging any forward gear while travelling backwards. On transmissions with a torque converter, doing so at very low speed (walking pace) is not harmful, but causes unnecessary wear on clutches and bands, and a sudden deceleration that not only is uncomfortable, but also uncontrollable since the brakes and the throttle contribute in the same direction. This sudden acceleration, or jerk, can still be felt when engaging the gear at standstill, but the driver normally suppresses this by holding the brakes. Travelling slowly in the right direction while engaging the gear minimizes the jerk further, which is actually beneficial to the wearing parts of the transmission. Electronically controlled transmissions may behave differently, as engaging a gear at speed is essentially undefined behaviour. Some modern transmissions have a safety mechanism that will resist putting the car in reverse when the vehicle is moving forward; such a mechanism may consist of a <b>solenoid-controlled</b> physical barrier {{on either side of the}} reverse position, electronically engaged by a switch on the brake pedal, so that the brake pedal needs to be depressed in order to allow the selection of reverse. Some electronic transmissions prevent or delay engagement of reverse gear altogether while the car is moving.|$|E
40|$|An igniter is {{described}} {{mounted on a}} vent stack with an upper, flame cage {{near the top of}} the stack to ignite emissions from the stack. The igniter is a tube with a lower, open, flared end having a spark plug near the lower end and a <b>solenoid-controlled</b> valve which supplies propane fuel from a supply tank. Propane from the tank is supplied at the top under control of a second, <b>solenoid-controlled</b> valve. The valve controlling the lower supply is closed after ignition at the flame cage. The igniter is economical, practical, and highly reliable...|$|E
40|$|The Electronic Regulator Project at TRW has {{constructed}} a breadboard system demonstrating pressure regulator operation {{over a wide}} range of flow conditions. The test hardware is composed of pneumatic-actuated, <b>solenoid-controlled</b> valves and associated tubing, gas volumes and transducers. System control, data recording and data reduction functions are controlled by a 486 -class PC running Labview software. This breadboard system has demonstrated that a single system, using several control modes, is versatile enough to be used across the TRW spacecraft product line, from the very low Xenon flows associated with an electric propulsion system, to the high Helium flows required in a constant thrust situation such as in the AXAF spacecraft. A conceptual flight version, composed largely of off-the-shelf parts, has been designed and evaluated relative to requirements of various TRW spacecraft...|$|E
40|$|Herbicide usage in {{weed control}} {{represents}} a significant economic cost and environmental risk in Australian sugarcane production. Weed spot spraying has potential to increase sugarcane production whilst reducing chemical usage and environmentally damaging runoff. However, weed spot spraying is traditionally a laborious manual task. This paper {{reports on a}} precision machine vision system that was developed to automatically identify and target the difficult to control weed Panicum spp. (Guinea Grass) in sugarcane crops. The infield machine vision system comprised a camera and artificial illumination to enable day and night trials. Image analysis algorithms were developed to discriminate Guinea Grass and sugarcane based on colour and textural differences between the species. A positive weed identification from the image analysis activated <b>solenoid-controlled</b> spray nozzles. Evaluations of the system in a sugarcane crop established that the image analysis algorithm parameters required frequent recalibration during the day but that the requirement for recalibration was reduced at night with constant artificial illumination. The algorithm was only effective at detecting mature Guinea Grass. The developed technology is considered {{a viable alternative to}} manual spot spraying of mature Guinea Grass in sugarcane at night. A cost benefit analysis of the new weed control system indicated potential grower savings of $ 170 /ha by adopting the technology. ...|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the Advanced Diesel Engine Component Development (ADECD) Program {{to develop and}} demonstrate critical technology needed to advance the heavy-duty low heat rejection engine concept. Major development activities reported are the design, analysis, and fabrication of monolithic ceramic components; vapor phase and solid film lubrication; electrohydraulic valve actuation; and high pressure common rail injection. An advanced single cylinder test bed was fabricated as a laboratory tool in studying these advanced technologies. This test bed simulates the reciprocator for a system having no cooling system, turbo compounding, Rankine bottoming cycle, common rail injection, and variable valve actuation to achieve fuel consumption of 160 g/kW-hr (. 26 lb/hp-hr). The advanced concepts were successfully integrated into the test engine. All ceramic components met their functional and reliability requirements. The firedeck, cast-in-place ports, valves, valve guides, piston cap, and piston ring were made from silicon nitride. Breakthroughs required to implement a 'ceramic' engine included the fabrication of air-gap cylinder heads, elimination of compression gaskets, machining of ceramic valve seats within the ceramic firedeck, fabrication of cast-in-place ceramic port liners, implementation of vapor phase lubrication, and elimination of the engine coolant system. Silicon nitride valves were successfully developed to meet several production abuse test requirements and incorporated into the test bed with a ceramic valve guide and solid film lubrication. The ADECD cylinder head features ceramic port shields to increase insulation and exhaust energy recovery. The combustion chamber includes a ceramic firedeck and piston cap. The tribological challenge posed by top ring reversal temperatures of 550 C was met {{through the development of}} vapor phase lubrication using tricresyl phosphate at the ring-liner interface. A <b>solenoid-controlled,</b> variable valve actuation system that eliminated the conventional camshaft was demonstrated on the test bed. High pressure fuel injection via a common rail system was also developed to reduce particulate emissions...|$|E
40|$|Antimicrobial {{resistance}} (AMR) poses a critical, yet historically understated {{threat to}} global public health. Recent mutations in the enterobacteriaceae genome that confer resistance to multiple antibiotics, {{have made some}} virtually untreatable. Currently, antibiotics are prescribed largely on guesswork, {{with little or no}} prior evidence as to their efficacy. This not only accelerates the spread of AMR, but endangers patient's lives in the process. To counter this, new tools are required which can rapidly identify a pathogen's susceptibility to an antibiotic prior to administration. Traditional procedures are labour-intensive, taking several days - with sample preparation and cell-culture being the primary bottlenecks. A novel, proof-of concept system was developed to rapidly determine antibiotic resistance in pathogens using nucleic acid analysis. The system comprised of a plastic microfluidic cartridge, control software, optical reader and *control hardware*. E. coli were captured, concentrated and lysed within the device; DNA could be amplified on-chip using rapid, isothermal DNA amplification (Recombinase Polymerase Amplification). The assay identified samples containing the CTX-M resistance gene; the limit of detection was 500 copies (in 50 l), as measured by the reader's integrated fluorescence microscope. Each component was validated prior to integration into the final system. Concentrations of E. coli equivalent to a urinary-tract-infection (100, 000 Colony Forming Units/ mL) were captured with up to 98 % efficiency from 1 ml suspensions onto functionalised, 0. 5 m magnetic, ion-exchange beads. These were isolated on-chip by a NdFeB magnet, providing up to 96 % bead-capture and a 100 x volume reduction. An oil compartmentalised the aqueous samples within the chip, while thermal control was achieved by coupling a resistive heater to an IR camera. Fluid routing was managed by bespoke, in-line, <b>solenoid-controlled</b> valves, which could operate at 5 -bar and for over 4000 cycles without degrading. Bacteria were thermally or chemically lysed post-concentration, and an on-chip metering chamber aliquoted fixed-volumes of buffer (1 % uncertainty for 400 nl). DNA from lysed bacteria was amplified on-chip with a limit of detection of 250 E. coli per sample in the final assay. Both sample-preparation and DNA amplification performed well on the prototype system. However, inefficient bacterial elution on-chip post-capture prevented the steps being run sequentially, as insufficient bacteria were released to the lysis region. Future development would fully integrate sample transfer and automate the fluid actuation so as to enable complete sample-in, answer-out capability...|$|E
