500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1628, there was {{flooding}} at Fishlake and Sykehouse, which was followed by rioting. A navigable sluice was built at Turnbridge in 1629, with a lock , and an outfall sluice called the [...] "Great Sluice" [...] was completed in 1630, probably by Hugo <b>Spiering,</b> who had assisted Vermuyden with the main project. Continued problems with flooding led {{to the construction of}} a [...] channel from Newbridge near Thorne eastwards to Goole, where water levels in the Ouse were between [...] lower than at Turnbridge. The channel, called the Dutch River, ended in another outfall sluice, and was completed in 1635 at a cost of £33,000. Boats continued to use the lock at Turnbridge. In about 1688 the Goole sluice was washed away by a flood, and was never replaced. The tidal scour widened the channel, and barges of up to 30 tonnes could normally reach Fishlake, and often Wilsick House, in Barnby Dun. Smaller boats could reach Doncaster for most of the year, and large barges could do so when there was a flood tide.|$|E

2500|$|The {{flooding}} of Fishlake and Sykehouse {{resulted from}} there being insufficient washlands {{to hold the}} flow of the Don while the sluice at Turnbridgedike was closed by high water levels in the Aire. A navigable sluice was constructed at Turnbridgedike, including a lock chamber which was [...] and 17 discharge gates, each [...] The structure was probably built by Hugo <b>Spiering,</b> who assisted Vermuyden, and was called the Great Sluice. This still did not fully alleviate the problems of flooding, and so a new [...] embanked channel was constructed from Newbridge to the River Ouse at Goole between 1632 and 1635. The river levels at Goole were some [...] lower than at Turnbridgedike, and so discharge was more efficient. The total cost of the channel and outfall sluice was £33,000. There was no navigable connection to the Ouse at Goole, as boats continued to access the Aire at Turnbridgedike. The channel eventually became the wide Dutch River after two drains were swept into one following a great flood.|$|E

2500|$|In the Hatfield Level {{drainage}} project {{which started}} in 1626, the Dutch civil engineer Cornelius Vermuyden diverted the Don northwards along Turnbridgedike. He constructed Dikesmarsh bank some distance {{to the east of}} the channel, so that the intervening land could be used as washlands. The main work was completed by 1628, but after flooding in 1629, a [...] "Great Sluice" [...] was constructed at the junction between the river and the Aire, with 17 openings which were , probably by Hugo <b>Spiering,</b> who had assisted Vermuyden on the main project. The washlands had insufficient capacity, and in 1632 work started on a new channel, which would run for [...] from Newbridge, near Thorne, eastwards to enter the Ouse at the site of Goole, [...] upstream of the Trent. Water levels here were between [...] lower than at Turnbridge. This new channel was called the [...] "Dutch River", and was finished in 1635, at a cost of £33,000. It ended in a sluice at Goole, and was never intended to be navigable, as boats could access the Aire at Turnbridge. The sluice was later swept away in a flood and never replaced.|$|E
50|$|With {{a letter}} of {{recommendation}} from Joachim, <b>Spiering</b> joined the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 1892 and remained with that organization until 1896. He often appeared as a soloist with conductor Theodore Thomas. <b>Spiering</b> also organized the <b>Spiering</b> Quartet, which performed 400 concerts between 1893 and 1905. He founded the <b>Spiering</b> Violin School and was also director and instructor of violin for the Chicago Musical College from 1902 to 1905 followed by four years of concert tours in Europe. Gustav Mahler chose him as concertmaster for the New York Philharmonic for two years from 1909, and <b>Spiering</b> was called to conduct the orchestra for the final seventeen concerts of 1911 during Mahler's illness. Although it was expected <b>Spiering</b> would be chosen as Mahler's successor, the tradition of seeking European conductors lead to the selection of Josef Stransky. Disappointed, <b>Spiering</b> returned to Europe, where he guest conducted the Berlin Philharmonic and Blüthner orchestras.
