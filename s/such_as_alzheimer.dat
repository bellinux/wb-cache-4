Natural selection has not eliminated many harmful conditions and nonadaptive characteristics that appear among older adults, <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>Alzheimer</b> disease. If {{it were a}} disease that killed 20-year-olds instead of 70-year-olds {{this may have been}} a disease that natural selection could have eliminated ages ago. Thus, unaided by evolutionary pressures against nonadaptive conditions, modern humans suffer the aches, pains, and infirmities of aging and as {{the benefits}} of evolutionary selection decrease with age, the need for modern technological mediums against non-adaptive conditions increases.|$|E

50|$|The key {{contribution}} of the research-based pharmaceutical industry to medical progress is to turn fundamental research intoinnovative treatments that are widely available and accessible to patients, {{with the goal of}} helping people live longer and be healthier. High blood pressure and cardiovascular disease can be controlled with anti-hypertensive medicines and cholesterol-lowering medicines, knee or hip replacements prevent patients from immobility, and some cancers can be controlled or even cured thanks to newer targeted medicines. Yet there remain huge challenges in many disease areas <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>Alzheimer,</b> multiple sclerosis, many cancers and orphan diseases.|$|E

50|$|Embryo {{donation}} to research provides {{a major source}} of stem cells for stem cell research. The hope is that stem cell research will aid in finding cures for various major diseases <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>Alzheimer,</b> cancer, SMA, and Parkinson's diseases. Some stem cell research is done by using human embryos, and one option that parents have once they are done with in vitro fertilization is to donate their unused embryos to stem cell research. One review came to the result that the proportion of IVF users who donated embryos for research varied geographically, from 7% in France to 73% in Switzerland. A study done in the United States revealed that 60% of American donors would donate the unused embryos to science.|$|E
50|$|Genomic {{imprinting}} is {{an example}} of epigenetic inheritance that results in the maternal and paternal copies of certain genes being expressed differently. The evolutionary origin of genomic imprinting has been hotly debated, and the conflict theory was proposed to explain its development. This theory posits that imprinting evolved in response to a genetic ‘battle between the sexes’ to determine the level of maternal resources invested in each offspring. Jirtle examined the imprint status of the IGF2R and IGF2 in what, at the time, were unconventional species (opossum and platypus). The data generated from these phylogenetically informative species are consistent with the evolution of imprinting about 150 million years ago in a common ancestor to Therian mammals (i.e. Metatherians and Eutherians) with the advent of placentation and live birth without the use of a shelled egg, and provide strong support for the conflict theory of imprinting evolution. Imprinted genes have been implicated in complex human disorders <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>Alzheimer</b> disease, autism, obesity, diabetes and schizophrenia. Jirtle has contributed to the better understanding of these human conditions by identifying novel imprinted genes, either by biochemical analysis of individual genes or by genome-wide studies that used machine learning-based approaches to predict candidate imprinted genes, followed by biochemical examination of these candidates.|$|E

50|$|As {{an example}} of {{clinical}} applications, researchers at the Mayo Clinic used an RNA-Seq approach to identify differentially expressed transcripts between oral cancer and normal tissue samples. They also accurately evaluated the allelic imbalance (AI), ratio of the transcripts produced by the single alleles, within a subgroup of genes involved in cell differentiation, adhesion, cell motility and muscle contraction identifying a unique transcriptomic and genomic signature in oral cancer patients. Novel insight on skin cancer (melanoma) also come from RNA-Seq of melanoma patients. This approach led to the identification of eleven novel gene fusion transcripts originated from previously unknown chromosomal rearrangements. Twelve novel chimeric transcripts were also reported, including seven of those that confirmed previously identified data in multiple melanoma samples. Furthermore, this approach {{is not limited to}} cancer patients. RNA-Seq has been used to study other important chronic diseases <b>such</b> <b>as</b> <b>Alzheimer</b> (AD) and diabetes. In the former case, Twine and colleagues compared the transcriptome of different lobes of deceased AD's patient's brain with the brain of healthy individuals identifying a lower number of splice variants in AD's patients and differential promoter usage of the APOE-001 and -002 isoforms in AD's brains. In the latter case, different groups showed the unicity of the beta-cells transcriptome in diabetic patients in terms of transcripts accumulation and differential promoter usage and long non coding RNAs (lncRNAs) signature.|$|E
