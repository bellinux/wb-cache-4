5000|$|WFBL dropped [...] "Hot Hits" [...] in October 1980 {{in favor}} of the then-emerging adult <b>standards</b> <b>format</b> called Music of Your Life.

5000|$|By 1993, WAIT {{had adopted}} an Adult <b>Standards</b> <b>format.</b> The station {{initially}} aired ABC Radio's satellite-fed Adult <b>Standards</b> <b>format</b> Stardust, and later aired Westwood One's satellite-fed Adult <b>Standards</b> <b>format</b> called [...] "AM Only" [...] (now America's Best Music). [...] WAIT enjoyed ratings success as an Adult Standards station, making {{it into the}} top 10 among Chicago area stations and taking a 3.3 audience share in April 1996. At {{least part of the}} ratings increase could be attributed to longtime adult standards station WJJD switching to a news/talk format. In October 2000, NextMedia Group purchased WAIT from Pride Communications.|$|R

5|$|The rector of this Church of England parish as of 2011 is the Rev Neil Batcock. The {{benefice}} rotates {{its services}} among its five constituent churches, with typically five services in total on Sundays, and two mid-week Holy Communions. As with most Anglican churches in England, the congregation is mainly elderly, {{although there are}} monthly family services focussed on children. There is also a monthly laying on of hands for healing, and sometimes other variants from the <b>standard</b> <b>format</b> involving music or Taizé-influenced worship. The parish accepts the diocese's guidance on permitting baptism and marriage in church after a divorce, and claims {{to work closely with}} its Catholic and Methodist neighbours.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{there are}} three basic formats of USB connectors: the default or <b>standard</b> <b>format</b> {{intended}} for desktop or portable equipment (for example, on USB flash drives), the mini intended for mobile equipment (now deprecated except the Mini-B, which is used on many cameras), and the thinner micro size, for low-profile mobile equipment (most modern mobile phones). Also, there are 5 modes of USB data transfer, in order of increasing bandwidth: Low Speed (from 1.0), Full Speed (from 1.0), High Speed (from 2.0), SuperSpeed (from 3.0), and SuperSpeed+ (from 3.1); modes have differing hardware and cabling requirements. USB devices have some choice of implemented modes, and USB version is not a reliable statement of implemented modes. Modes are identified by their names and icons, and the specifications suggests that plugs and receptacles be colour-coded (SuperSpeed is identified by blue).|$|E

KRNT was rebranded ESPN Des Moines as it became the market's ESPN Radio affiliate.|$|R
5|$|Little {{literary}} evidence survives of {{the activities}} of the gladiatorial training and fighting (ludi). They appear to have followed the <b>standard</b> <b>format</b> of the Roman games: animal entertainments in the morning session, followed by the executions of criminals around midday, with the afternoon session reserved for gladiatorial combats and recreations of famous battles. The animal entertainments, which featured creatures from throughout the Roman Empire, included extravagant hunts and fights between different species. Animals also played a role in some executions which were staged as recreations of myths and historical events. Naval battles formed part of the spectacles but whether these took place in the amphitheatre or on a lake that had been specially constructed by Augustus is a topic of debate among historians.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{other data}} buses (e.g., Ethernet, HDMI), USB {{connections}} are directed, with both {{upstream and downstream}} ports emanating from a single host. This applies to electrical power, with only downstream facing ports providing power; this topology was chosen to easily prevent electrical overloads and damaged equipment. Thus, USB cables have different ends: A and B, with different physical connectors for each. Therefore, in general, each different format requires four different connectors: a plug and receptacle {{for each of the}} A and B ends. USB cables have the plugs, and the corresponding receptacles are on the computers or electronic devices. In common practice, the A end is usually the <b>standard</b> <b>format,</b> and the B side varies over standard, mini, and micro. The mini and micro formats also provide for USB On-The-Go with a hermaphroditic AB receptacle, which accepts either an A or a B plug. On-The-Go allows USB between peers without discarding the directed topology by choosing the host at connection time; it also allows one receptacle to perform double duty in space-constrained applications.|$|E
5|$|As in Forza Motorsport 3, {{there is}} a career mode for players to complete, which sees players racing at {{multiple}} locations around the world. This is known as World Tour Mode in Forza Motorsport 4, previously known as Season Play in Forza Motorsport 3. However, one new feature that appears in Forza Motorsport 4 is the game's ability to adapt the difficulty as the player progresses through the career, and collect a trend of data {{to see how well}} they perform. This allows AI drivers to change and upgrade their cars automatically to suit the player's driving abilities. There are several types of races besides the <b>standard</b> <b>format.</b> Forza Motorsport 4 includes the original bumper-to-bumper races, but also has drift, autocross, and multiple-heat races. Unlike in Forza Motorsport 3 where players had no choice over which car they received after leveling up, in Forza Motorsport 4 players are now able to choose one out of several cars as a prize, which are automatically upgraded to the high end of their class. Players are able to import their Forza Motorsport 3 profiles into Forza Motorsport 4. This gives them the ability to transfer a certain number of in-game credits and gifted cars into their new garage. The allowed number transferred is based on how long they have played the game and how many cars and credits they have. Players have the option to create car clubs and share cars in their garages within that club. Previous games in the series were limited to eight cars on the track, however Forza Motorsport 4 supports 16 player racing online, and two players offline.|$|E

25|$|The lettermail service {{allows the}} {{transmission}} of virtually any paper document. The 2015 and 2016 rate was 85 cents for a standard letter (30 g or less) and $1.20 for a letter between 30 g and 50 g. Rates usually increase in mid-January of each year (in 2014 the increase was delayed {{to the end of}} March); for ordinary letters (30 g or less), the 2014 rate was originally scheduled to be $0.65. The rate was regulated by a price-cap formula, linked to the inflation rate. The Corporation now has a “permanent” stamp that is valued at the domestic rate forever, eliminating the need to buy 1 cent stamps after a rate increase. The rates for lettermail are based on weight and size and determine whether the article falls into the aforementioned <b>standard</b> <b>format</b> or in the oversize one.|$|E
25|$|Research on {{decompression}} continues. Data is {{not generally}} {{available on the}} specifics, however Divers Alert Network (DAN) has an ongoing citizen science based programme run by DAN (Europe) which gathers data from volunteer recreational divers for analysis by DAN research staff and other researchers. This research is funded by subscription fees of DAN Europe members. The Diving Safety Laboratory is a database to which members can upload dive profiles {{from a wide range}} of dive computers converted to a <b>standard</b> <b>format</b> and other data about the dive. Data on hundreds of thousands of real dives is analysed to investigate aspects of diving safety. The large amounts of data gathered is used for probabilistic analysis of decompression risk. The data donors can get immediate feedback in the form of a simple risk analysis of their dive profiles rated as one of three nominal levels of risk (high, medium and low) based on comparison with Bühlmann ZH16c M-values computed for the same profile.|$|E
