5000|$|It is {{important}} that the chainwheel match the chain size (i.e. the link pitch) closely. Even a small difference in link size or consistency can cause undue wear on the chainwheel and/or cause the chain to jump off the windlass when the winch is operating, particularly during payout, a runaway condition sometimes referred to as [...] "water spouting" [...] should it occur at high speed. Nowadays, especially on large tankers and cruise ships, the windlass may be split into independent port and starboard units.

In {{order to}} {{study the effects of}} <b>sectional</b> <b>warping</b> to bend-twist {{coupling}} characteristics for box spar of wind turbine blade, section stiffness of different regions are calculated with weather considering warping effect or not, the results show that warping effects differently in different part of the blade and the length width ratio and thickness of spar cap are two factors that determine impact degree of warping. Section stiffness of a 5 MW blade box spar considering warping effect are calculated, bend-twist coupling coefficients are got. The results show that warping effect bend-twist coupling coefficient of box spar greatly and it should be considered when research the blade bend-twist coupling...|$|R

40|$|AbstractStructures of {{the open}} {{thin-walled}} profile are usually designed so to avoid twisting the individual elements. However, for some systems {{it is impossible to}} completely prevent twisting due to the torsion of a thin-walled open section, <b>sectional</b> <b>warping</b> due to tightness, additional sectoral stresses. The torsional stiffness of the thin-walled open section of the rod is much higher than their pure torsion rigidity. The structural analysis {{of the open}} thin-walled profile can be performed using a finite element shell. This requires careful selection and design of the grid partition and greatly increases the number of nodes and elements in the calculation scheme.

The displacement distribution in three directions along the thickness are derived respectively {{by use of}} the <b>sectional</b> <b>warping</b> corrective theory, and the hierarchical displacement functions are adopted in the width direction. Finally, {{based on the principle}} of virtual work, a special finite element model for boundary-layer effects is obtained. Accuracy and convergence of the solution are studied, and the present results are compared with those of the existing finite difference and conventional finite element methods. It is shown that the present stresses result is in good agreement with the exact solution, and the effectiveness of the present model for analyzing free edge stresses is ascertained. The present model is simple while the degree of freedom is lower than that of the other numerical methods...|$|R

While coloured silk is mostly used in figure work, the solid border have extra weft figuring threads. The weft for borders and body being different, three shuttle weaving is adopted, two for border and one for plain body. The border therefore appears as separately woven and then stitched to the body of the sari. Some times a separate pallu warp is twisted on the body. The end piece has fine silk. Warp threads are only of zari forming a golden ground upon which angular, brightly coloured silk designs are woven in the interlocked weft, producing a tapestry effect.|$|R
