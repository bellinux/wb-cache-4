5|$|The {{exposition}} to Night Trap {{is presented}} to the player by Lt. Simms of the Sega Control Attack Team (<b>S.C.A.T.)</b> {{at the start of}} the game. He explains that the team was alerted to the disappearance of five teenage girls who were last seen at the Martin winery estate. The Martin family consists of Victor Martin, his wife Sheila, their children Jeff and Sarah, and cousin Tony. The missing girls were reportedly invited to stay for the night. Police questioned the Martin family, but they claimed the girls had left safely, and they refused to let the police search the property. The police then handed over the case to <b>S.C.A.T.,</b> which investigated the house and discovered a series of traps, security cameras, and an operational unit in the basement to control the apparatus. The <b>S.C.A.T.</b> agents spliced an override cable onto the control system and connected it to a control panel in the back hallway of the house. The player is given the role of an internal <b>S.C.A.T.</b> operative charged with controlling the traps and cameras from this back hallway.|$|E

5|$|The swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor) {{feeds on}} the fallen fruit of P.lanceolata and disperses the seed through its <b>scat</b> (dung). A field study in Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park found that 88% of {{seeds in the}} <b>scat</b> were still viable {{although}} dormant. The red-necked wallaby (Macropus rufogriseus) feeds on drupes and is a likely seed dispersal agent. Animals can convey seed {{for one or two}} kilometres from where they have fed. Rodents such as the bush rat (Rattus fuscipes) and black rat (Rattus rattus) eat the drupes but chew the seed so that only fragments leave their digestive system. Foxes have been reported to eat the fruit, and kangaroos and large birds such as currawongs are thought to as well.|$|E
40|$|The diet of {{sympatric}} dingoes and feral cats was {{studied in}} the semiarid southern rangelands of Western Australia. A total of 163 <b>scats</b> were collected {{over a period of}} 19 months. Rabbit remains were the most common food item in cat <b>scats,</b> followed by reptiles, small mammals and birds. Macropod remains were the most common food item in dingo <b>scats,</b> followed by rabbits and birds. Dingo <b>scats</b> did not contain small mammal remains, and infrequently contained arthropod and reptile remains. Cat and dingo <b>scats</b> contained remains from 11 and six mammal species, respectively. Of the small mammals, cat <b>scats</b> contained rodent remains more frequently than those of dasyurids. Dietary diversity of cats was higher than for dingoes and dietary overlap between the two species was relatively low...|$|R
30|$|In total, 263 {{carnivore}} <b>scats</b> were identified. The {{largest number}} of <b>scats</b> was from U. cinereoargenteus (90), whilst the rest were from P. concolor (54), P. yagouaroundi (42), L. pardalis (21), N. narica (20), L. wiedii (16) and P. onca (16).

40|$|International audienceDistribution {{data for}} elusive species are {{often based on}} {{detection}} of field signs rather than of the animal itself. However, identifying field signs can be problematic. We present here {{the results of a}} survey for American mink,, in the northern highlands of Scotland to demonstrate the importance of verifying field sign identification. Three experienced surveyors located <b>scats,</b> which they identified as mink <b>scats,</b> at seven of 147 sites surveyed and “possible” mink <b>scats</b> at a further 50 sites. Mitochondrial DNA was successfully extracted from 45 of 75 (60 %) <b>scats,</b> collected from 31 of the 57 “positive” sites; sequencing of amplified DNA fragments showed that none of these <b>scats</b> was actually of mink origin. We consider the implications of erroneous survey data and the potential waste of resources and misdirection of conservation/management actions. We discuss potential methods that may be useful to verify field sign identification, including the use of DNA analysis, and stress that verification is crucial to ensure rigorous and reliable survey data...|$|R
5|$|Tigers {{have been}} studied in the wild {{using a variety of}} techniques. The populations of tigers have been {{estimated}} using plaster casts of their pugmarks, although this method was criticised as being inaccurate. More recent attempts have been made using camera trapping and studies on DNA from their <b>scat,</b> while radio collaring has been used to track tigers in the wild. Tiger spray {{has been found to be}} just as good, or better, as a source of DNA as <b>scat.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tracks are an {{important}} factor in distinguishing coyote from dog predation. Coyote tracks tend to be more oval-shaped and compact than those of domestic dogs, and their claw marks are less prominent and the tracks tend to follow a straight line more closely than those of dogs. With the exception of sighthounds, most dogs of similar weight to coyotes have a slightly shorter stride. Coyote kills can be distinguished from wolf kills by less damage to the underlying tissues in the former. Also, coyote <b>scat</b> tends to be smaller than wolf <b>scat.</b>|$|E

40|$|Non-invasive {{methods have}} the {{potential}} to circumvent problems associated with using more traditional techniques when surveying for rare and elusive species. In this study, non-invasive molecular-based methods have been used to analyse the <b>scats</b> of several species of marsupials. DNA was successfully extracted from <b>scats</b> of the quokka, Setonix brachyurus, and three other macropods (Macropus fuliginosus, M. irma and M. eugenii) sympatric with the quokka and with similar-appearing <b>scats.</b> Partial sequence from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene from these four species and seven other macropods was used to measure genetic differentiation among them to determine whether the quokka could be unambiguously identified from the <b>scats</b> alone. The results confirm that molecular approaches can be used for macropod species identification using <b>scats</b> as the source material. The approach will have potential survey and management applications, and, more specifically, may lead to more accurate assessment of the quokka's geographic range, leading to implementation of more appropriate management strategies for its conservation...|$|R
40|$|An {{increase}} of over 10 % in mill throughput {{was achieved by}} removing the ball <b>scats</b> from a single-stage SAG mill. These <b>scats</b> are non-spherical ball fragments resulting from uneven wear of balls with included porosity. 30 t of <b>scats</b> were removed from a total charge load of 70 t. Surveying and modelling the mill revealed that the breakage rates had increased dramatically at the coarser end of the size distribution. This work {{highlights the importance of}} maintaining a competent ball charge in a mill...|$|R
40|$|The {{existence}} of spontaneous calcium transients (<b>SCaTs)</b> dependent on intracellular store activation {{has been reported}} in putative axonal terminals of cerebellar basket interneurons. We used the two-photon imaging technique to optically identify basket terminals in acute cerebellar slices of young rats (11 - 16 d old) and study the properties of <b>SCaTs</b> unambiguously localized in these regions. The whole-cell recording configuration and preloading technique were alternatively used to load the calcium-dependent dye in the interneuron and compare <b>SCaTs</b> with action potential evoked calcium transients. <b>SCaTs</b> were observed in the basket terminals at frequencies that were significantly increased after bath application of 10 μm ryanodine and did not depend on P/Q- or N-type voltage-dependent calcium channel activation. They originated at specific sites where bursts of events with temporal separation as small as 200 msec could be generated. Their sites of origin were spaced on average 6 μm apart and were preferentially located near axonal endings. <b>SCaTs</b> had amplitudes comparable with those of Ca 2 + rises evoked by single action potentials that lead to release of neurotransmitter, as confirmed by parallel recordings of preloaded terminals and evoked IPSCs in the postsynaptic Purkinje cells. These results support the hypothesis that <b>SCaTs</b> at basket terminals underlie the large miniature IPSCs characteristic of Purkinje cells...|$|R
5|$|In 2011, it was {{reported}} that N.rajah has a similar mutualistic relationship with the summit rat (Rattus baluensis). Whereas the mountain treeshrew visits pitchers during daylight hours, the summit rat is primarily active at night; this may be an example of resource partitioning. Daily <b>scat</b> deposition rates were found to be similar for both mammalian species.|$|E
5|$|Records of otters preying upon beavers (Castor canadensis) vary; it {{has been}} {{reported}} in the southern boreal forest of Manitoba. Trappers in Alberta, Canada commonly assert otters are major predators of beavers. A 1994 river otter study reported findings of beaver remains in 27 of 1,191 scats analyzed. However, many other studies did not report any findings of beaver remains in the <b>scat</b> sampled.|$|E

Large numbers of ladybirds {{have been reported}} drinking the nectar of this species, while ignoring nearby Banksia attenuata inflorescences. The white-tailed dunnart (Sminthopsis granulipes) has been observed visiting flower spikes. Pollen has been found on the snouts and in the <b>scat</b> of several species of dasyurid marsupials, which suggests these animals are likely pollinators of Banksia species in general. No pollinators of this species were recorded in The Banksia Atlas survey.|$|E
5|$|Fishers are generalist predators. Although {{their primary}} prey is snowshoe hare and porcupine, {{they are also}} known to {{supplement}} their diet with insects, nuts, berries, and mushrooms. Since they are solitary hunters, their choice of prey is limited by their size. Analyses of stomach contents and <b>scat</b> have found evidence of birds, small mammals, and even moose and deer—the latter two indicating {{that they are not}} averse to eating carrion. Fishers have been seen to feed on deer carcasses. While the behavior is not common, fishers have been known to kill larger animals, such as wild turkey, bobcat, and lynx.|$|E

5|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{are thought}} to be preyed upon by large owls, such as the Madagascar owl (Asio madagascariensis), and snakes like the Malagasy tree boa (Sanzinia madagascariensis). In one case, a family of fork-marked lemurs {{exhibited}} mobbing behavior when they encountered a Malagasy tree boa. Diurnal raptors, such as the Madagascar buzzard (Buteo brachypterus) and Madagascar cuckoo-hawk (Aviceda madagascariensis) hunt these lemurs at dusk, and the hunting behavior of the Madagascar harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus) suggests it might extract them from their sleeping holes. The fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) has also been seen attacking fork-marked lemurs, and remains have been found in their <b>scat.</b>|$|E
5|$|River otters are not scavengers; {{they avoid}} {{consuming}} carrion. Northern river otters do not generally handle prey {{of a large}} size relative to themselves but there are occasions where they've been observed ambushing and killing adult common snapping turtles while the large turtles (which are roughly equal in average body weight to a river otter) are hibernating. Remains of the much larger American beaver {{have been found in}} otter <b>scat</b> in some regions, although most otter dietary studies in areas where otters and beaver are sympatric do not show them to be regular predators of beavers (despite the claims of fur-trappers that otters frequently hunt beavers) and perhaps only young beaver kits may be attacked.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a few {{instances}} of fishers preying on cats and small dogs; in Massachusetts |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517202212/http://www.mass.gov/dfwele/dfw/wildlife/living/living_with_fisher.htm |archivedate=May 17, 2008 |accessdate=August 21, 2016}} but in general, the evidence suggests these attacks are rare. A 1979 study examined the stomach contents of all fishers trapped in the state of New Hampshire; cat hairs were found in only 1 of over 1,000 stomachs. More recent studies in suburban upstate New York and Massachusetts found no cat remains in 24 and 226 fisher diet samples (<b>scat</b> and stomach contents) respectively. While there is popular belief for more frequent attacks on pets, zoologists suggest bobcats or coyotes are more likely to prey upon domestic cats and chickens.|$|E

40|$|Fecal {{samples were}} {{examined}} to estimate black bear (Ursus americanus) diet in northeastern Oregon during 1998 and 1999 {{to determine the}} important food items. Mean estimated relative volume of food items in 621 <b>scats</b> was 35 % grasses, 24 % insects, 16 % fruit, 11 % soil and wood, 10 % animal remains, and 4 % leaves and stems. During June, remains of mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and elk (Cervus elaphus) occurred in 44 % of the <b>scats</b> in 1998 and in 25 % in 1999, {{at a time when}} other protein-rich food sources were unavailable. Between May and October, > 40 % of all <b>scats</b> collected in each month contained insects, and 98 % of those <b>scats</b> collected in July contained insects. A significantly higher volume of insects occurred in <b>scats</b> in 1999 compared to 1998, probably because berries were scarce in 1999. Of the 434 <b>scats</b> containing insects, 40 % contained carpenter ants (Camponotus spp.), 45 % other small ants (Lasius sp, Tapinoma sp., Aphaenogaster sp.), 36 % forest ants (Formica spp.), and 23 % yellowjackets (Vespula spp., Dolichovespula sp.).

40|$|This study aims to {{renovate}} the method of studying seasonal variation in wolf diet by introducing simultaneous analysis of undigested residua and pollen grains in wolf <b>scats</b> collected regardless of their freshness over {{a short period of}} time, in which pollen grains help to identify the season the diet was taken. The present study was conducted over a range of 500 km along the Dempster Highway extending north from Dawson, Yukon Territory to Inuvik, the Northwest Territories, Canada. We collected a total of 24 wolf <b>scats</b> along side roads and rivers, in which as many as 14 million pollen grains/scat were found on an average. The analysis revealed that the wolves relied exclusively on the caribou during winter when <b>scats</b> are free of pollen grains, but increase their dependence on the beaver and other mammals up to over 50 % in term of residuum occurrence in spring and summer when <b>scats</b> are respectively loaded primarily with arboreal and herbaceous pollen grains. This result was consistent with the local fauna of prey animals, the migration pattern of the caribou for breeding and wintering, availability of the beaver and other rodents as dictated by ice/snow cover, and breeding and cub rearing pattern of the wolves themselves. Thus it was concluded that the pollen analysis serves as a powerful and effective tool for identifying the seasonality of old <b>scats,</b> and therefore saves {{a great deal of time}} and effort to be devoted to finding fresh <b>scats...</b>|$|R
5|$|Born in Munich, Germany, Hamauzu's {{mother was}} a piano teacher and his father, Akimori Hamauzu, an opera singer. He {{developed}} an interest in music while in kindergarten. Growing up in Germany, Hamauzu received piano and singing lessons from his parents and created his first original compositions during high school.

Hamauzu met his wife, Matsue Hamauzu (née Fukushi), at the university, and they have two children. Matsue worked alongside Hamauzu on the soundtrack to Final Fantasy VII as a soprano and Sigma Harmonics as a <b>scat</b> singer; she was also a soprano for the score to Final Fantasy VIII & a lead vocalist in Final Fantasy XIII. After graduating from the university, he thought about becoming a classical musician, but he eventually found out that he wanted to work with game music instead.|$|E
5|$|Coyotes {{are often}} {{attracted}} to dog food and {{animals that are}} small enough to appear as prey. Items such as garbage, pet food, and sometimes feeding stations for birds and squirrels attract coyotes into backyards. About three to five pets attacked by coyotes are brought into the Animal Urgent Care hospital of South Orange County (California) each week, the majority of which are dogs, since cats typically do not survive the attacks. <b>Scat</b> analysis collected near Claremont, California, revealed that coyotes relied heavily on pets as a food source in winter and spring. At one location in Southern California, coyotes began relying on a colony of feral cats as a food source. Over time, the coyotes killed most of the cats, and then continued to eat the cat food placed daily at the colony site by people who were maintaining the cat colony.|$|E
5|$|Fish are {{the primary}} {{component}} of the river otter's diet throughout the year. Every study done on the food habits of the river otter has identified varying fish species as being the primary component of its diet. For instance, an Alberta, Canada study involved the collection and analysis of 1,191 samples of river otter scats collected during each season. Fish remnants were found present in 91.9% of the <b>scat</b> samples. Moreover, a western Oregon study revealed fish remains were present in 80% of the 103 digestive tracts examined. Crustaceans (crayfish), where regionally available, are the second-most important prey for otters. Crustaceans may even be consumed more than fish. For example, a study conducted in a central California marshland indicated crayfish formed nearly 100% of the river otter's diet at certain times of the year. However, river otters, as foragers, will immediately take advantage of other prey when readily obtainable. Other prey consumed by river otters includes fruits, reptiles, amphibians, birds (most especially moulting ducks which render the birds flightless and thus makes them easier to capture), aquatic insects, small mammals, and mollusks.|$|E
