Therefore, reduction/minimization of excess <b>sludge</b> within activated <b>sludge</b> processes may be an ideal solution. This study focuses {{on the use of}} a modified activated <b>sludge</b> process, named the oxic-settling-anaerobic (OSA) system, to achieve an effective reduction in excess <b>sludge</b> production. Its key feature is to insert a <b>sludge</b> holding tank in the <b>sludge</b> return circuit to provide an anaerobic <b>sludge</b> zone. The objectives of the study are to: 1) demonstrate the excess <b>sludge</b> reduction in an OSA system; 2) evaluate the appropriate operating conditions; and 3) study the mechanisms of excess <b>sludge</b> reduction, so as to maximize the excess <b>sludge</b> reduction efficiency of the OSA system. In continuous-flow studies, an OSA system was operated in parallel with an activated <b>sludge</b> process as a reference system to investigate the effects of the oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) level and the <b>sludge</b> anaerobic exposure time (SAET) in the <b>sludge</b> holding tank on the <b>sludge</b> reduction. The intended level of ORP was maintained by periodical pure nitrogen purging thus preventing the pH drop by chasing the gaseous product in the <b>sludge</b> holding tank. SAET was regulated by changing the pumping rate of the return <b>sludge</b> from settling tank. In batch studies, proposed mechanisms involving soluble microbial products (SMPs) effects, microbial population effects and <b>sludge</b> decay effects were verified. In addition, a COD balance was carried out to supplement the understanding of the mechanisms. The main findings of my research are : 1) the OSA system had a lower <b>sludge</b> yield and oxygen demand than the reference system under the same solids quantity condition, which demonstrated that an OSA system could provide a cost-effective solution for excess <b>sludge</b> reduction; 2) the OSA system improved COD removal efficiency and <b>sludge</b> settleability; 3) a low ORP in the <b>sludge</b> holding tank favored the excess <b>sludge</b> reduction; 4) low <b>sludge</b> growth yield, soluble microbial products (SMPs) effect and microbial predator contribution were unable to explain the excess <b>sludge</b> reduction; and 5) the excess <b>sludge</b> reduction in an OSA system was mainly due to increased <b>sludge</b> decay in the <b>sludge</b> holding tank under an anaerobic condition and the utilization of COD generated from the <b>sludge</b> decay through denitrification, sulfate reduction, phosphorus release and volatile organic gas production that occurred in the <b>sludge</b> holding tank of the OSA system, among which, the contribution of gaseous production was significant.

The addition of this AT <b>sludge</b> (1. 2 % 0. 5 % of total volatile solids) to methanogenic <b>sludge</b> enhanced the production of biogas. The optimum volume of the addi-tion and the pretreatment temperature of the AT <b>sludge</b> for optimum biogas production were 5 % (v/v) and 65 °C. Batch-fed anaerobic digestion was covered with the addition of various AT <b>sludges.</b> The AT <b>sludge</b> prepared with the AT seed <b>sludge</b> improved the biogas production by 2. 2 times relative to that from the sewage <b>sludge</b> addition. The addi-tion of <b>sludge</b> without AT seed <b>sludge</b> weakly enhanced biogas production. An aerobic thermophilic bacterium (strain AT 1) was isolated from the AT seed <b>sludge.</b> Strain AT 1 grew well in a synthetic medium. The production of biogas from the anaerobic digestion of sewage <b>sludge</b> was improved by the addition of 5 % (v/v) AT 1 bacterial culture compared with that from the sewage <b>sludge</b> addition.

40|$|Anaerobic {{digestion}} is {{a biological}} {{process in which}} municipal and industrial solid wastes are converted to biogas and anaerobic digested <b>sludge.</b> In this study, the rheological behaviour {{of different types of}} <b>sludge</b> as well as <b>sludge</b> mixtures are studied. Primary <b>sludge,</b> secondary <b>sludge,</b> primary &ndash; secondary <b>sludge</b> mixtures and primary &ndash; secondary &ndash; digested <b>sludge</b> mixtures behaved as non &ndash; Newtonian, shear thinning materials exhibiting a yield stress. A dimensionless form of the Herschel &ndash; Bulkely model was employed to develop master curves to predict the rheological properties of primary <b>sludge,</b> secondary <b>sludge</b> or <b>sludge</b> mixtures. Below the yield stress, primary and secondary <b>sludge</b> (with 2. 8 &ndash; 9. 2 % TS) exhibited viscoelastic behaviour similar to soft glassy materials. Primary <b>sludge</b> experienced abrupt yielding such that viscosity bifurcation was detected similar to highly thixotropic colloidal suspensions. Secondary <b>sludge</b> transitioned smoothly into the liquid regime similar to gels. Primary and secondary <b>sludge</b> flowed steadily into the liquid regime. Increasing the solids concentration of primary and secondary <b>sludge</b> increased the hydrodynamic and non &ndash; hydrodynamic interactions so that the apparent viscosity and yield stress increased following exponential and power law models as a function of total solids concentration, respectively. The apparent viscosity and yield stress of <b>sludge</b> mixtures prepared by mixing primary <b>sludge</b> (with 3, 4, 5, 6. 5 and 7. 1 %TS) to secondary <b>sludge</b> (with 3, 4, 5, 6. 5 and 7. 1 %TS) increased with increasing volume fraction of secondary <b>sludge.</b> This was attributed to the deflocculation of the weakly bound structure of primary <b>sludge</b> so that the weak colloidal particles of primary <b>sludge</b> became entrapped and entangled into the gel like network structure of secondary <b>sludge.</b> These parameters followed a power law model as a function of secondary <b>sludge</b> volume fraction. When thickened primary <b>sludge</b> (5. 4 % TS) was mixed with dilute secondary <b>sludge</b> (2. 8 %TS) and vice &ndash; versa, the apparent viscosity and yield stress of the mixed <b>sludge</b> increased with increasing volume fraction of the thickened <b>sludge</b> &ndash; regardless of <b>sludge</b> type following a power law model {{as a function of the}} volume fraction of thickened <b>sludge.</b> The apparent viscosity and yield stress of primary &ndash; secondary &ndash; digested <b>sludge</b> prepared by mixing a 50 : 50 (v/v) primary &ndash; secondary <b>sludge</b> mixture (with 3, 4, 5. 1, 6. 3, 7. 1 %TS) to digested <b>sludge</b> (with 3, 4, 5. 1, 6. 3, 7. 1 %TS) increased with increasing volume fraction of digested <b>sludge</b> so that the solid interactions within the <b>sludge</b> mixture increased &ndash; highlighted using the shear compliance and shear modulus. When a thickened primary &ndash; secondary <b>sludge</b> mixture (50 : 50 v/v and 5 % TS) was mixed with dilute digested <b>sludge</b> (1. 8 %), the apparent viscosity and yield stress decreased as the volume fraction of digested <b>sludge</b> increased. This was attributed to the dilution effect. As such, the apparent viscosity and yield stress followed a power law model as a function of volume fraction of digested <b>sludge.</b> The parameters of these models were predicted using the pH of the <b>sludge</b> mixtures. Finally, procedures were presented to demonstrate how the developed correlations may be used to optimize the power and energy requirements of unit operations such as pumps and mixing systems...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are three}} main {{mechanisms}} of damage in non-proliferative retinopathy: blood vessel damage or remodeling, direct retinal damage, or occlusion {{of the blood}} vessels. The first mechanism is indirect damage by altering the blood vessels that supply the retina. In the case of hypertension, high pressures in the system causes {{the walls of the}} artery to thicken, which effectively reduces the amount of blood flow to the retina. This reduction in flow causes tissue ischemia leading to damage. Atherosclerosis, or hardening and narrowing of blood vessels, also reduces flow to the retina. The second mechanism is direct damage to the retina usually caused by free radicals that causes oxidative damage to the retina itself. Radiation, solar retinopathy, and retinopathy of prematurity fall under this category. The third common mechanism is occlusion of blood flow. This can be caused by either physically blocking the vessels of the retinal artery branches or causing the arteries to narrow. Again, the end result is reduced blood flow to the retina causing tissue damage. Sickle cell disease compromises blood flow by causing blood to sludge, or thicken and flow slowly, through the retinal arteries. Other disorders that cause hyperviscosity syndrome may also cause blood <b>sludging.</b> Lastly, clots or central artery thrombosis directly blocks flow to the retina causing the cells to die.|$|E
