5|$|Following {{the issues}} with the {{publishing}} of Killing Time, there was increased oversight by Roddenberry's staff regarding the novels published by Pocket Books. This was delegated to Arnold, and would later cause confusion for Pocket Books as comments would be sent back and it was sometimes unclear whether they were from Roddenberry or Arnold. These comments rejected plot developments in the novels where they were <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the bounds set by the television series. Rumours subsequently spread {{that there was an}} alternative version of the manuscript with more explicit Kirk/Spock slash details, something that Van Hise later denied.|$|E
5|$|After <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the TARDIS in modern-day Colchester, the Doctor {{is blown}} {{off his feet}} by a blast of air, and the TARDIS, Amy still inside, dematerialises into the time vortex and refuses to rematerialise. With Amy's help, the Doctor tracks the {{disturbance}} {{to the second floor}} of a house. The Doctor opts to take a room for rent offered by the downstairs tenant, Craig Owens, in order to determine what is present on the second floor without alerting whatever it is to his Time Lord nature. Neither Craig nor the Doctor are aware that people are being lured off the street to the second floor flat and never leaving again, but the Doctor is conscious of localised time loops and disturbances aboard the TARDIS that coincide with noises from the second floor.|$|E
5|$|While nine innings {{has been}} the {{standard}} {{since the beginning of}} professional baseball, the duration of the average major league game has increased steadily through the years. At the turn of the 20th century, games typically took {{an hour and a half}} to play. In the 1920s, they averaged just less than two hours, which eventually ballooned to 2:38 in 1960. By 1997, the average American League game lasted 2:57 (National League games were about 10 minutes shorter—pitchers at the plate making for quicker outs than designated hitters). In 2004, Major League Baseball declared that its goal was an average game of 2:45. By 2014, though, the average MLB game took over three hours to complete. The lengthening of games is attributed to longer breaks between half-innings for television commercials, increased offense, more pitching changes, and a slower pace of play with pitchers taking more time between each delivery, and batters <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the box more frequently. Other leagues have experienced similar issues. In 2008, Nippon Professional Baseball took steps aimed at shortening games by 12 minutes from the preceding decade's average of 3:18.|$|E

25|$|The Council of Trent (1545–1563) {{objected to}} the {{floating}} or hovering depictions, and demanded {{a return to the}} older conception, with Christ's feet firmly on the ground, either <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> a sarcphagus, or standing upright, holding a banner. This was generally followed, at least until the 19th century. However, Tintoretto's 1565 depiction at his former parish church of San Cassiano (Venice) still shows the figure of Christ as floating above the tomb.|$|E
25|$|After two {{incomplete}} {{passes to}} begin the drive, Vick escaped a blitz by scrambling to his left for 33 yards before <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> bounds at the Eagles' 45-yard line. A pass to Avant and another scramble by Vick set the Eagles up at the 20-yard line at the two-minute warning. Facing second and three from the 13-yard line, Vick passed to Maclin on the left side, and Maclin shook a tackle from CB Terrell Thomas and reached the end zone, tying the game at 31–31 with 1:16 remaining.|$|E
25|$|In another tale, Amaterasu retreats from {{conflict}} {{with her brother}} Susa No O into a cave, depriving the Earth of sunlight and life. In order to coax Amaterasu from the cave, the deity of humour and dance, Ame No Uzume, performs a bawdy sexual dance that involved exposing her breast and vulva, and inviting Amaterasu to admire them. On Amaterasu's <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the cave, the transgender kami Ishi Kori Dome held up a magical mirror, and {{the combination of the}} dance and her reflection fascinate Amaterasu so much that she does not notice other spirits closing the cave entrance behind her.|$|E

25|$|In September 2013, Burton {{announced}} that he would be <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the No. 31 {{at the end of the}} season due to a lack of additional sponsorship. On September 9, it was {{announced that}} Ryan Newman will drive the No. 31 beginning in 2014, bringing sponsor Quicken Loans with him from Stewart-Haas Racing for 12 races. Kevin Harvick had transferred to Stewart-Haas Racing, Newman's previous team, essentially meaning the two drivers were switching teams, although they did not end up in the same rides. In spite of not winning a race, Newman made it to the final round of the new chase format, finishing second in points to Harvick, losing by just one point.|$|E
25|$|At 7:18p.m. ADT, {{the first}} 9-1-1 call {{was made to}} police about an armed man walking down a {{sidewalk}} on Pioneer Avenue and towards the woods west of the street. Twelve RCMP officers responded to the scene {{and set up a}} perimeter around the woods and the surrounding neighbourhood. Bourque was first seen by Cst. Mathieu Daigle <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the forest, crossing a street, and entering another wooded area that bordered the backyards of several houses. Daigle sent out a radio transmission describing Bourque, but some radio static was heard, which made the description difficult to understand. Daigle was then joined by Csts. Fabrice Gevaudan and Rob Nickerson as they trailed Bourque, who was headed toward a house on Bromfield Court, where five other officers were positioned. All of the officers were intending on maintaining visual contact on him while waiting for the arrival of Police Dog Services, who were scheduled to arrive in a few minutes.|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the plot}} {{elements}} of Ruddigore were introduced by Gilbert in his earlier one-act opera, Ages Ago (1869), including {{the tale of the}} wicked ancestor and the device of the ghostly ancestors <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> their portraits. When Ruddigore closed, no new opera was ready. Gilbert again proposed a version of the [...] "lozenge" [...] plot for their next opera, and Sullivan reiterated his desire to leave the partnership. While the two men worked out their artistic differences, Carte produced revivals of such old favourites as H.M.S. Pinafore, The Pirates of Penzance, and The Mikado.|$|E

500|$|To helm the project, the {{producers}} Broadbent and Czernin approached John Madden, who {{was nominated for}} the Academy Award for Best Director for Shakespeare in Love in 1998. Madden considered the characters in The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel to be of [...] "an analogous kind of geographical suspension", which have [...] "entered a strange world removed from their former reality, cut off from their past, {{where they have to}} invent a new life for themselves". Dench and fellow cast members Maggie Smith, Penelope Wilton, Celia Imrie, Bill Nighy, Ronald Pickup, Tom Wilkinson, and director John Madden jumped at the opportunity to all work {{together for the first time}} in one film. Producer Broadbent considers Dench's character to be central to the story, and that Evelyn is much like Dench herself, being [...] "the most wonderfully sympathetic person". John Madden considers Maggie Smith's character Muriel to be [...] "instinctively xenophobic, never <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> her comfort zone in any way", which is not uncommon in England.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Carey at a photoshoot {{in a private}} room at the Plaza Hotel, {{speaking}} the line, [...] "And I was like, {{why are you so}} obsessed with me?" [...] Next, a Rolls-Royce Phantom is shown pulling up to the hotel, with Carey <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the vehicle. As she gets out of the car, Carey dressed as a bellhop, assists her to the ramp where she is walking and greeting fans. The next scene finds Carey walking into the hotel, and waving to everyone, with the camera zooming to the bellhops face to reveal him intently staring at her. As the first verse begins, Carey is shown at the photo-shoot in the hotel, with a cameo by Patrick Demarchelier as the photographer. The bellhop, now dressed in a gray hoodie and sweatpants, is shown holding a hair-blower at Carey, apparently assisting with the shoot. As the shoot continues, scenes of the bellhop are shown in his room, where he has dolls of Carey on the wall, as well as quilts with the cover of her 2005 album, The Emancipation of Mimi.|$|E
500|$|Panjaa {{received}} largely {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The movie was criticised for {{its lack of}} story and weak screenplay, though it was praised for its stylish presentation. Rediff gave a two stars, said [...] "Panjaa is let down by a weak script. Panjaa also reminds one of Pawan Kalyan's own earlier movie, Balu. The {{second half of the}} film lags a bit. There doesn't seem to be much originality in the story telling. On the whole, Panjaa is nothing extraordinary and even a bit disappointing". [...] rated two stars, noted [...] "The main drop down in the film is Pawan's character design. His getup and being a yesman to a gangster aren't in kilter with his nursery business. First half is morose and second half is emotion overdose. On a whole, Panjaa hits badly on the expectations of audience". Deccan Chronicle gave two stars says [...] "The much-hyped action thriller lacks the adrenaline of a tight and creative script and one feels let down when <b>stepping</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the theatre". A gangster film with mafia backdrop, It got mixed reviews but its title song, Panjaa, was the song of the year.|$|E
