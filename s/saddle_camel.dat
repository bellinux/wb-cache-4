50|$|Etymology of Tawqee is {{referred}} to Vaqa’a (Arabic: وقع) which means throwing. Other meaning {{of it is a}} sign of <b>camel’s</b> <b>saddle</b> on its body. According to this meaning, Tawqee was a signature of Caliph or rulers on the letter of complaint.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the eve of}} the Conquest of Mecca in 630, Abu Sufyan {{decided to}} become a Muslim. Jumanah responded: [...] "Finally, you see that Bedouins and foreigners have {{followed}} Muhammad, while you have been his confirmed foe! You should have been the first person to assist him!" [...] Abu Sufyan urged his slave Madhkur to hurry <b>saddling</b> the <b>camels</b> and horse to meet Muhammad's army at al-Abwa. Together with Jumanah, Ja’far and his cousin Abdullah ibn Abi Umayya, he travelled in disguise and in fear of his life, [...] "for my blood was permitted." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus he saw most of {{what passed}} in the town, {{including}} the desolation wrought by the fearful tempest of hail, which, being in their cave, both he and the camel escaped without harm. On the next evening from his post of outlook up the tree, where he had now some difficulty in hiding himself because the hail had stripped off all its leaves, he saw Marût and myself brought from the guest-house and taken away by the escort. Descending and running to the cave, he <b>saddled</b> the <b>camel</b> and started in pursuit, plunging into the forest and hiding there when he perceived that the escort were leaving us.|$|R
50|$|The extreme {{conditions}} of desert life pressed the Wanman to develop techniques to harvest food from grasses and this traditional knowledge served them {{well as they}} moved towards the coast, since they could quickly adapt their skills to glean buffel or afghan grass, which had seeded into the landscape from imported <b>camel</b> <b>saddles</b> and was in demand as a fodder grass in arid zones.|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "Deir al-Bukht" [...] is Arabic for [...] "Convent of the Bactrian Camel." [...] According {{to early}} 13th-century Syrian {{geographer}} Yaqut al-Hamawi, Deir al-Bukht {{had previously been}} known as [...] "Deir Mikhail", a monastery dedicated to Saint Michael. It received its current name {{as a result of}} early 8th-century Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik's habit of having a Bactrian <b>camel</b> <b>saddled</b> at the monastery.|$|R
25|$|By {{at least}} 1200 BC, the first <b>camel</b> <b>saddles</b> had appeared, and Bactrian camels could be ridden. The first saddle was {{positioned}} {{to the back}} of the camel, and control of the Bactrian camel was exercised by means of a stick. However, between 500–100 BC, Bactrian camels attained military use. New saddles, which were inflexible and bent, were put over the humps and divided the rider's weight over the animal. In the seventh century BC, the military Arabian saddle appeared, which again improved the saddle design slightly.|$|R
5000|$|A sutrah (سترة lit., [...] "screen, cover") is {{an object}} {{used by a}} person {{performing}} salat as a barrier between himself and one passing in front of him. The person praying should be positioned at {{less than or equal}} to three forearms' length away from the Sutrah. The Sutrah’s height must be no less than one forearm's length (i.e. the height of the rear end of a <b>camel's</b> <b>saddle),</b> whereas its width has no stipulated size. The Sutrah is compulsory for anyone performing salat (unless a Sutrah cannot be found after searching).|$|R
5000|$|Lif, preferably from Gau date trees is {{also used}} as a soft but durable filling {{material}} called Lihaf (لحاف). Among the older Manasir Lihaf is preferred to cotton for filling mattresses and considered very healthy.Lif is further employed to fill of the lower parts of donkey saddles {{in order to prevent}} sores by friction and called Libdah (لبدة) or Bedidah (بديدة - the [...] "ة" [...] can be substituted by a [...] "ى"). The Bedouin Manasir employ Lif for the same purpose in their <b>camel</b> <b>saddles</b> and call it Tillah (تلّة).|$|R
6000|$|... [32] The Somal use as <b>camel</b> <b>saddles</b> {{the mats}} which compose their huts; these lying loose upon the animal's back, cause, by {{slipping}} backwards and forwards, {{the loss of}} many a precious hour, and in wet weather become half a load. The more civilised make up of canvass or [...] "gunny bags" [...] stuffed with hay and provided with cross bars, a rude packsaddle, which is admirably calculated to gall the animal's back. Future travellers {{would do well to}} purchase camel-saddles at Aden, where they are cheap and well made.|$|R
5000|$|Camels caused several {{problems}} on set. O'Toole {{was not used}} to riding camels and found the saddle to be uncomfortable. While in Amman during a break in filming, he bought a piece of foam rubber at a market and added it to his saddle. Many of the extras copied the idea and sheets of the foam can be seen on many of the horse and <b>camel</b> <b>saddles.</b> The Bedouin nicknamed O'Toole [...] "'Ab al-'Isfanjah" [...] (...) , meaning [...] "Father of the Sponge". The idea spread and, to this day, many Bedouins add foam rubber to their saddles.|$|R
60|$|As soon as {{the column}} arrived the work of pulling down the walls of boxes and <b>saddles,</b> getting the <b>camels</b> {{to their feet and}} loading them, began. So many of the camels had been killed that the number {{surviving}} was insufficient to carry down the stores, therefore the smaller redoubt was left untouched and a stronger garrison than before placed in it, and the rest moved down to the river. The troops all partook of a hearty meal before the start was made. Sir Herbert Stewart {{and the rest of the}} wounded were taken down in the cacolets with the column.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, Stanford's Cantor Arts Center {{opened an}} exhibition, [...] "Art of Being Tuareg: Sahara Nomads in a Modern World", {{the first such}} exhibit in the United States. It was curated by Tom Seligman, {{director}} of the center. He had first spent time with the Tuareg in 1971 when he traveled through the Sahara after serving in the Peace Corps. The exhibition included crafted and adorned functional objects such as <b>camel</b> <b>saddles,</b> tents, bags, swords, amulets, cushions, dresses, earrings, spoons and drums. The exhibition also was shown at the University of California, Los Angeles Fowler Museum in Los Angeles and the Smithsonian's National Museum of African Art in Washington, D.C.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was very}} hot. About one hundred ten {{thousand}} people were there. By {{the order of}} Muhammad a rostrum of <b>camel</b> <b>saddles</b> was made. After performing the Zuhr prayer, Muhammad made the long speech {{now known as the}} Ghadir Sermon (Arabic: خطبة الغدير). He recited numerous verses from the Quran, and reminded the people of their deeds, and warned them about the future. However, he spoke its most well-known sentence when he raised Ali’s hand and said, [...] "whomever I am his master, this Ali is his master (Mawla)." [...] When Abu Bakr & Umar heard this, they said to Ali: [...] "O son of Abu Talib, you have become the master of every male and every female believer, morning and evening, congratulations." ...|$|R
5000|$|On the {{way back}} to Medina, Muhammad stopped at Ghadir Khumm on Dhu al-Hijjah 18, to convey the message to the pilgrims before they dispersed. He gave a long sermon on a rostrum of <b>camel</b> <b>saddles.</b> At one point, he asked his {{followers}} whether he, Muhammad, had more authority (awla) over the believers than they had over themselves; the crowd’s answer was positive aloud. Then he took Ali by the hand and declared:Whomever's master (mawla) I am, this Ali is also his master.Then the Prophet also announced his imminent death and charged the believers to remain attached to the Qur'an and Ahl al-Bayt [...]Afterward, the caravan moved towards Medina and apparently arrived there on 24th of Dhu al-Hijjah. Last days of Dhu al-Hijjah, Muhammad was in Medina.|$|R
50|$|Several of {{his books}} focus on Iran but deal also with the larger Muslim world, {{including}} The Patricians of Nishapur: a Study in Medieval Islamic History (1972), Conversion to Islam in the Medieval Period: An Essay in Quantitative History (1979), and Islam: the View from the Edge (1994). His books on a broader view of Islamic history and society include Under Siege: Islam and Democracy (1994) and The Case for Islamo-Christian Civilization (2004). His book The Camel and the Wheel (1975) brings together {{his interest in the}} histories of technology, animal domestication, and the Middle East, dealing for example with the significant military advantage early Muslim armies gained from a slight improvement in the design of cloth <b>camel</b> <b>saddles.</b> He would return to the history of animal domestication with his Hunters, Herders, and Hamburgers: The Past and Future of Human-Animal Relationships (2005).|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, at any rate," [...] the {{sergeant}} said, [...] "we {{can do nothing}} just at present. The troops may be within a mile, {{and they may be}} ten miles off; there is no saying. There is nothing for us to do but to wait until we hear something of them. If we do not hear anything of them we shall know that they either have not struck the river, or have struck it so far off that we cannot hear the guns. In that case my opinion is that we may as well rest here for to-day. Before we move I think it will be decidedly better to take the <b>saddles</b> off the <b>camels</b> and hide them in the bushes, and then move away some distance and hide up ourselves. This is evidently a cultivated country, and if there are any natives about they will be sure to see the camels, so we had better not be near them. There is no fear of the animals straying; they will be eating and drinking all day." ...|$|R
50|$|Most Christian {{denominations}} do {{not follow}} any specific rituals or rules related to menstruation. Some Christian denominations, including many authorities of the Eastern Orthodox Church and {{some parts of the}} Oriental Orthodox Church (also known as the Russian, Ukrainian, Greek, and Indian Orthodox Church), distinct from the Roman Catholic Church, advise women not to receive communion during their menstrual period.Other denominations follow the rules laid out in the Holiness Code section of Leviticus, somewhat similar to the Jewish ritual of Niddah.Healthy women have adequate outflow during this cycle, which renders them impure for sacred devotions, even more so in public.In Genesis 31:34-35, menstruation is referenced in a story, where Rachel was, or pretended to be in her menstrual period:Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, {{and put them in the}} <b>saddle</b> of the <b>camel,</b> and sat upon them. And Laban felt about all the tent, but found them not. And she said to her father: Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise up before thee; for the manner of women is upon me. And he searched, but found not the teraphim.|$|R
50|$|These new armies {{could help}} states grow {{in size and}} became {{increasingly}} centralized. Early ancient armies continued to primarily use bows and spears, the same weapons that had been developed in prehistoric times for hunting. The findings {{at the site of}} Nataruk in Turkana, Kenya, have been interpreted as evidence of inter-group conflict and warfare in antiquity, but this interpretation has been challenged. Early armies in Egypt and China followed a similar pattern of using massed infantry armed with bows and spears.Infantry were at this time the dominant form of war, partially because the <b>camel</b> <b>saddle</b> and the stirrup were not yet invented. This infantry would be divided into ranged and shock, with shock infantry either charging to cause penetration of the enemy line or holding their own. These forces would ideally be combined, thus presenting your opponent with a dilemma: group your forces and leave them vulnerable to ranged, or spread them out and make them vulnerable to shock. This balance would eventually change as technology allowed for chariots, cavalry, and artillery to play an active role on the field.|$|R
5000|$|The camp is bombed by Japanese planes, killing Wyatt {{and several}} Mongols, and {{destroying}} the radio. McHale is disappointed when the Mongols disappear, leaving them alone and defenseless. Rather than walking 300 {{miles to the}} nearest weather station, which might also have been attacked, McHale decides to evacuate 800 miles to the sea and sail to join US forces on Okinawa. At an oasis where some Chinese traders are camped, they find Kengtu and his people. McHale confronts the chief for failing to help the navy as promised. Kengtu explains that he was protecting his people from the [...] "birds in the sky" [...] but agrees to put the question of helping the Americans to his people. The Mongols return the saddles. Chinese trader Yin Tang (Edgar Barrier) then barters for the <b>saddles,</b> offering four <b>camels,</b> and suggests that the Americans travel with his group. That night the treacherous Yin Tang attempts to kill them, to steal back the camels, but is stopped {{by the arrival of}} Kengtu and his men.|$|R
40|$|In 1953, Werner Caskel {{produced}} a theory {{which he called}} “the Bedouinization of Arabia”. In this, he maintained that around AD 100 Arabia was peaceful, dominated by settled states, with some non-tribal nomads who were simply “shepherds near the cities”. He contrasted this with Arabia in the sixth and seventh centuries in which he claimed “the Bedouin form of society and ideo logy prevailed”. The evidence he provided for this false dichotomy consisted of errors, misunderstandings and argumenta ex silentio, as was pointed out at the time, but his theory has nevertheless been widely accepted in the years which followed. In 1959, it was taken up and adapted by Walter Dostal who tried to explain the “Bedouinization” by producing a novel definition of the Bedouin as “camel-herders accustomed to fighting as rider warriors” and said that “Vollbeduinen” were only those who used the shadād or so-called “North-Arabian” <b>camel</b> <b>saddle</b> which, he imagined, gave them a secure seat from which to fight. In fact, however, {{there is no evidence}} at all that nomads in Arabia have ever fought from camel-back if they could possibly get off to fight on foot or on horseback. Nevertheless, in 1975, Richard Bulliet adopted Dostal’s idea and took it further by claiming that the use of the shadād made camel-riders an almost invincible force and this produced “an alteration in the balance of political power in favour of the nomads”. This gave apparent support to Caskel’s idea that the North Arabian Bedouin were able to sweep to military and political domination of the sedentaries by the sixth century AD. The present examination of these theories shows that there is no basis to them and, in doing so, argues that what is known of nomadic life in Arabia between AD 100 and 500 suggests continuity both in its structures and in its relations with the sedentaries...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the sixth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Jacob set his sons and his wives on camels {{and headed out}} toward Isaac and Canaan with all the animals and wealth that he had {{collected}} in Padan-aram. Jacob tricked Laban by fleeing secretly while Laban was out shearing his sheep, and Rachel stole her father's idols. On the third day, Laban heard that Jacob had fled {{and he and his}} kin pursued after Jacob seven days, overtaking him in the mountain of Gilead. God came to Laban in a dream and told him not to speak to Jacob either good or bad. But when Laban caught up with Jacob, he asked Jacob what he meant by carrying away his daughters secretly, like captives, without letting him kiss his daughters and grandchildren goodbye. Laban said that while he had the power to harm Jacob, God had told him the previous night not to speak to Jacob either good or bad, and now Laban wanted to know why Jacob had stolen his gods. Jacob answered that he fled secretly out of fear that Laban might take his daughters by force, and not knowing Rachel stole the gods, he told Laban that whoever had his gods would die. Laban searched Jacob's tent, Leah's tent, and the two maid-servants' tent, finding nothing, and then he entered Rachel's tent. Rachel had hidden the idols in the <b>camel's</b> <b>saddle</b> and sat upon them, apologizing to her father for not rising, as she was having her period. Laban searched and felt about the tent, but did not find the idols. Angered, Jacob questioned Laban what he had done to deserve this hot pursuit and this searching. Jacob protested that he had worked for Laban for 20 years, through drought and frost, bearing the loss of animals torn by predators, and not eating Laban's rams, only to have his wages changed 10 times. Had not the God of Isaac been on Jacob's side, surely Laban would have sent Jacob away empty, Jacob said, and God had seen his affliction and awarded him what he deserved. The sixth reading ( [...] , aliyah) ends here.|$|R
