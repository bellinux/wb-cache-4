25|$|The 4th Ersatz Division {{was formed}} on {{mobilization}} from 13 brigade replacement battalions (Brigade-Ersatz-Bataillone). Each brigade replacement battalion was numbered after its parent infantry brigade, and was formed with two companies {{taken from the}} replacement battalion {{of each of the}} brigade's two infantry regiments. Thus, collectively, the 13 brigade replacement battalions represented troop contributions from 26 different infantry regiments. The four battalions of the 9th Mixed Ersatz Brigade were from the Prussian Province of Brandenburg, as were the brigade's artillery, cavalry and pioneer formations. Two battalions of the 13th Mixed Ersatz Brigade were from the Prussian Province of Saxony, one was a mixed battalion from Prussian Saxony and the Duchy of Anhalt, and one was a mixed battalion from Prussian Saxony and the Duchy of Saxe-Altenburg. The brigade's artillery, cavalry and pioneer formations were primarily from Prussian Saxony. The five battalions of the 33rd Mixed Ersatz Brigade, from the IX Army Corps area in northern Germany, were even more mixed: the 33rd Brigade Replacement Battalion was from the Hanseatic Cities of Bremen and Hamburg; the 34th from the Grand Duchies of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz; the 35th and 36th from Schleswig-Holstein; and the 81st from <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> <b>and</b> the Hanseatic City of Lübeck.

50|$|The Oberliga Nord {{was formed}} in 1974 to form a highest playing level for the states of Niedersachsen, <b>Schleswig-Holstein,</b> <b>Hamburg</b> <b>and</b> Bremen. As such it was a {{continuation}} of the old Regionalliga Nord which was superseded by the 2. Bundesliga Nord in 1974. It stopped operating in 1994 when the Regionalliga Nord was reformed, now as the third tier of the German football league system. It was replaced by the Oberliga Hamburg/Schleswig-Holstein and the Oberliga Niedersachsen/Bremen. In 2004 the Oberliga Nord was re-established to replace these two leagues. To add to the confusion, the Oberliga Nord again ceased to exist after the 2007-08 season with the establishment of the 3. Liga.|$|R
50|$|For example, shelducks {{live on the}} snails {{that are}} found in {{hundreds}} of thousands {{on the surface of}} the mudflats.

Archaeological evidence suggests around 750 BC a relatively uniform Germanic people from the Netherlands to the Vistula and southern Scandinavia. In the west, the newcomers settled the coastal floodplains for the first time, since in adjacent higher grounds the population had increased and the soil had become exhausted.|$|E
50|$|The area of {{responsibility}} of BALTAP comprised the territory of Denmark (without Greenland and the Faroe Islands), the German states Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein and the eastern North Sea, the Baltic approaches with Skagerrak, Kattegat, the Danish straits, and the Baltic Sea. One peculiarity was the responsibility for air defence over the German part of the BALTAP area. Until 1990, the western Allies were responsible for air defence over the whole Federal Republic of Germany {{on the basis of}} the occupation statute. After France had withdrawn from the integrated military structure of the alliance, this task was undertaken by the United States and the United Kingdom. The Second Allied Tactical Air Force (2 ATAF) was responsible for the area of <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> <b>and</b> <b>Hamburg,</b> and was led by a British officer from RAF Germany, with headquarters in Mönchengladbach.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{from the}} 19th century onwards {{the use of}} Standard German was {{strongly}} promoted especially by the Prussian administration, Low German languages are still present in rural areas, with an estimated number of five to eight million active speakers. However, since World War II and the immigration of expellees from the former eastern territories of Germany, its prevalence has steadily reduced. Besides which, Frisian is spoken in East and North Frisia, as well as Danish (Standard and South Jutlandic) in parts of Schleswig. From a linguistic and cultural perspective, Northern Germany {{is linked to the}} Netherlands, Scandinavia and England. For example, the German word for butcher is Fleischer or Metzger in the middle, east or south of Germany but is called a Schlachter in Northern Germany, resembling the Scandinavian terms for butcher, [...] "slagter/slakter". Another example is the word for potato, which is Erdapfel in much of Southern Germany, Austria and Switzerland, but Kartoffel in Northern Germany and in Danish, or the North German verb [...] "kieken" [...] (meaning to look), resembling the Danish [...] "kikke/kigge", or Norwegian [...] "kikke" [...] (to look). Additionally, Jansen/Janssen, Hansen, and Petersen are the most common surnames in the far north of Germany (Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein), which are also some of the most common surnames in Denmark (albeit with Jensen for Jansen). Hansen is the single most common surname in Norway, the third most common surname in Denmark, and the third and fifth most common surname in the North German federal states of <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> <b>and</b> <b>Hamburg,</b> respectively.|$|E

We tested students out of fourteen classes from four VET schools in three different German states (<b>Schleswig–Holstein,</b> Lower Saxony, <b>and</b> <b>Hamburg).</b> Laboratory biology assistants participated in the dual VET program, whereas biology technicians and medical laboratory technicians were part of the school-based VET program. Trained test leaders administered the study that was conducted on-site in the VET school classes. The test time was set for 3  h, with a 10 -min break. All the participants answering PROKLAS also answered items about their academic background, and additional questions about their general biological knowledge. Moreover, a sub-sample of 38 VET students answered questions about self-efficacy and perceived opportunities to learn.|$|R
50|$|In his {{investiture}} address, {{given on}} 28 October 1969 in Bonn, Chancellor Willy Brandt {{proposed that the}} government would consider Article 29 of the Basic Law as a binding order. An expert commission was established, named after its chairman, the former Secretary of State Professor Werner Ernst. After two years of work, the experts delivered their report in 1973. It provided an alternative proposal for the two regions: the north and center-southwest. In the north, either a single new state consisting of <b>Schleswig-Holstein,</b> <b>Hamburg,</b> Bremen <b>and</b> Lower Saxony should be created (solution A) or two new states, one in the northeast consisting of <b>Schleswig-Holstein,</b> <b>Hamburg</b> <b>and</b> the northern part of Lower Saxony (from Cuxhaven to Lüchow-Dannenberg) and one in the northwest consisting of Bremen and the rest of Lower Saxony (solution B). In the center and southwest, either Rhineland-Palatinate (with the exception of the Germersheim district but including the Rhine-Neckar region) should be merged with Hesse and the Saarland (solution C), the district of Germersheim would then become part of Baden-Württemberg.|$|R

50|$|Two years later, Hitler (who by {{then was}} head of state and the {{absolute}} dictator of Germany) formally transferred the office of Prussian Reichsstatthalter from himself to Göring. This office, {{as well as that}} of Minister-President (which Göring had already held from 1933) continued to exist but were subservient to the Nazi regime. Some changes were still made to Prussian provinces after this time. For example, the Greater Hamburg Act of 1937 transferred some territory from the provinces of Hanover <b>and</b> <b>Schleswig-Holstein</b> to <b>Hamburg</b> while at the same time annexing Hamburgian Geesthacht and the Hanseatic City of Lübeck to Schleswig-Holstein as well as Hamburgian Cuxhaven to the Province of Hanover. Other redeployments took place in 1939, involving cessions of Prusso-Hanoveran suburban municipalities to Bremen and in return the annexation of Bremian Bremerhaven to the Province of Hanover. Also Hanoveran Wilhelmshaven was ceded to Oldenburg. In 1942 redeployments involved the provinces of Saxony and Hanover and the Brunswick.|$|R
