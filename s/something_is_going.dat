5|$|The three {{arrive in}} Fairhope, Pennsylvania where Tommy and Jeffrey are living. The agents talk to Tommy and {{conclude}} that <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on. They soon discover that their car will not start. Back at her apartment, Scully is visited by Gabe Rotter (Brian Poth), a potential suitor of Harrison's. He presents Scully with {{the corpse of}} Spanky. Scully does an ad hoc necropsy and concludes that the cat bit its stomach open {{to try to get}} something out. She also discovers a cavity, where it appears something had lived inside the cat.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the morning}} {{somebody}} wakens me, I open my eyes and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking to somebody that {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that point I understood that <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on and I closed the door.|$|E
500|$|Between 1971 and 1973, reserves, public {{recreation}} {{areas and}} drainage sites were {{set aside in}} western Hamersley, and facilities were erected in quick succession – the 1st Hamersley Scout Group in 1973, the colonial-style Holy Cross Anglican Church in 1974, and a community hall at Aintree Street in 1975. Residents in the region were at this time {{on the fringe of}} Perth's suburban area, relying on partly built main roads, distant shopping centres and overstretched local facilities for several years after the suburb's construction. A locally produced fortnightly newspaper, the Hamersley Gazette, started in early 1973 by Peter Flanigan, from his home in Manton Court, covering the suburbs of Carine, Hamersley, Warwick and Greenwood, with the open aim of helping to form community associations and campaign for better facilities. A July 1973 article, for example, lamented that [...] "work on Erindale Road appears to have come to a standstill... great piles of dirt and unmade road surfaces bear testimony to the fact that <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on, or should be going on, but this one is taking a very long time." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bennett had {{the feeling}} that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> wrong with the scene.|$|R
60|$|ANNA--[Impressed by his tone.] You talk--nutty to-night yourself. You act's if you <b>was</b> scared <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen.|$|R

2500|$|Following the Test All Blacks coach Alex Wyllie remarked, [...] "There's always Campo, {{and when}} you've got a player {{like that in}} your team you always know {{probably}} <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to happen. He did it again – he just pulled that one out. An individual like that: one day he could probably blow it, but the other four days he could make it. It was just unfortunate he made it against us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sheldrake debated {{biologist}} Lewis Wolpert on {{the existence}} of telepathy in 2004 at the Royal Society of Arts in London. Sheldrake marshalled evidence for telepathy while Wolpert argued that telepathy fits Irving Langmuir's definition of pathological science and that the evidence for telepathy has not been persuasive. Reporting on the event, New Scientist said [...] "it was clear the audience saw Wolpert as no more than a killjoy. (...) There are sound reasons for doubting Sheldrake's data. One is that some parapsychology experimenters have an uncanny knack of finding the effect they are looking for. There is no suggestion of fraud, but <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on, and science demands that it must be understood before conclusions can be drawn about the results".|$|E
2500|$|There were {{allegations}} in a dossier that several matches, including eight at Wimbledon, were under suspicion of being fixed by professional gambling syndicates after bookmakers noted unexpected spikes in betting patterns. The dossier, released on the Sunday {{prior to the}} first day of play, had been commissioned by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), Women's Tennis Association (WTA), International Tennis Federation (ITF), and four Grand Slams earlier in the year, and was compiled by bookmakers. An official said, [...] "If you look at a tournament, you might see one match for £23,000 , one for £27,000, one for £36,000 and one for £4.5m. It doesn’t take a genius to work out that <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on in the last one." [...] Betting on Wimbledon matches was popular in 2007, with over £420m wagered on bets.|$|E

2500|$|Activist Joyce Shepard of Bayside, New York of the Citizens Action Committee for Change {{tried to}} {{highlight}} the issue of abused women. She contacted Hevesi's office to investigate. Hevesi issued a critical report on the Giuliani administration. On April 17, 1997, she was at New York City Hall with both Giuliani and Hevesi side by side. They promised more space for victims of domestic abuse. Despite all the promises nothing happened. She went undercover to expose the shortcomings of the shelter system. She criticized both Hevesi and Giuliani. After she was quoted by the Village Voice, Hevesi reportedly phoned her and told her: [...] "Don't you ever call my office about anything again!". The comptroller's office didn't deny the call took place. But a spokesman stated the office is open to anyone who thinks <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on we should know about.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1999, al-Shehhi, Atta, Ziad Jarrah, Said Bahaji, and Ramzi bin al-Shibh {{decided to}} travel to Chechnya {{to fight against the}} Russians, but were {{convinced}} by Khalid al-Masri and Mohamedou Ould Slahi at the last minute to change their plans. They instead traveled to Afghanistan to meet with Osama bin Laden and train for terrorist attacks. Immediately afterwards, Atta, al-Shehhi, and Jarrah reported their passports stolen, possibly to erase travel visas to Afghanistan. After their training, the hijackers began to attempt to hide their radicalism. al-Shehhi shaved his beard and seemed to his old friends like he had become less religious. After the attacks, a librarian in Hamburg reported that al-Shehhi boasted to her [...] "There will be thousands of dead. You will think of me ... You will see, in America <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to happen. There will be many people killed." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2009, TV Fanatic {{announced}} that [...] "the January 26 episode finds Tony and Ziva hopping {{a plane to}} the most romantic city on earth. The city of light, and of love. That's right, Ziva and Tony in Paris! You wouldn't believe it, but as if that weren't enough, their French hotel totally screws up the reservation and the two bad-ass agents end up ... gulp ... sharing a room together." [...] Executive producer Shane Brennan disclosed, [...] "There will be a realization that the spark is still there. It doesn't mean that <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> to be resolved, {{but it does mean}} that the journey may have started again. It's a long road back. When you think about what they went through, for them to resolve what happened and come to terms with that, it's a long road back." ...|$|E

2500|$|Children {{differ from}} {{adolescents}} and adults in their interpretation {{and ability to}} express their experience. [...] Like adults, children experience physical symptoms including accelerated heart rate, sweating, trembling or shaking, shortness of breath, nausea or stomach pain, dizziness or light-headedness. [...] In addition, children also experience cognitive symptoms like fear of dying, feelings of being detached from oneself, feelings of losing control or going crazy, but {{they are unable to}} vocalize these higher order manifestations of fear. [...] They simply know that <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> wrong and that they are very afraid. Children can only describe the physical symptoms. They have not yet developed the constructs to put these symptoms together and label them as fear. Parents often feel helpless when they watch a child suffer. [...] They can help children give a name to their experience, and empower them to overcome the fear they are experiencing ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{finishing}} Vernon, Florida, Morris {{tried unsuccessfully}} to get funding {{for a variety of}} projects. There was Road, a story about an interstate highway in Minnesota; a project about Robert Golka, the creator of laser-induced fireballs in Utah; and the story of Centralia, Pennsylvania, the coal town in which an inextinguishable subterranean fire ignited in 1962. He eventually got funding in 1983 to write a script about John and Jim Pardue, a pair of Missouri bank robbers who had killed their father and grandmother and robbed five banks. Morris's pitch went, [...] "The great bank-robbery sprees always take place at a time when <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> wrong in the country. Bonnie and Clyde were apolitical, but it's impossible to imagine them without the Depression as a back-drop. The Pardue brothers were apolitical, but it's impossible to imagine them without Vietnam." [...] Morris wanted Tom Waits and Mickey Rourke to play the brothers, and he wrote the script, but the project eventually failed. Morris worked on writing scripts for various other projects, including a pair of ill-fated Stephen King adaptations.|$|E
2500|$|The second Test {{witnessed}} a controversy when the Australian team {{was accused of}} having taken help from the dressing room in using the Umpire Decision Review System (DRS). Australia's captain Steve Smith admitted to having looked {{in the direction of}} the dressing room for assistance when he was given out leg before wicket (lbw) off Umesh Yadav when he was on 28 by the on-field umpire Nigel Llong, who, immediately intervened to send him back and denying a referral. India's captain Virat Kohli, in his post-match interview, accused the team of having done that on at least three occasions; once as Smith was declared lbw, and twice as he batted, which he stated to having pointed out to the umpires. As the controversy broke out, Australia's Peter Handscomb tweeted admitting to have [...] "referred" [...] Smith to [...] "look at the box". Picking on Smith having played down the incident terming it a [...] "brain fade", Kohli said, [...] "Honestly, if someone makes a mistake while batting, for me, personally, that's a brain fade. ... But if <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on for three days, then that's not a brain fade, as simple as that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Poirot {{is leaving}} the London Underground at Piccadilly Circus when he passes an old acquaintance, the Countess Vera Rossakoff, on the escalators, going in the {{opposite}} direction. She insists that they meet and when asked to suggest a place, responds [...] "In Hell…"! Poirot is puzzled {{but it is the}} unflappable Miss Lemon who coolly informs him it is the name of a new London nightclub and books him a table for that night. The club is in a basement and is decorated in styles of hell as represented by different cultures. It even has a large black, vicious-looking hound at the entrance called Cerberus. Rossakoff introduces him to Professor Liskeard who advised her on the decorations (although he is ashamed of the gaudy results), and to Dr Alice Cunningham, a practitioner of psychology who is engaged to Rossakoff's son, currently working in America. Alice and Poirot do not get along. She is coldly interested in criminal tendencies and finds Rossakoff's kleptomania interesting, but to Poirot's chagrin, she does not seem at all interested in the legendary detective! His questioning of her manner of dress with her heavy coat and pocketed skirt instead of a more feminine style of clothing does not go down well. However, Alice does find an individual called Paul Varesco fascinating. He is a good-looking lounge lizard with a very dubious reputation and she spends time dancing with him, questioning him incessantly about incidents in his childhood which could have contributed to his personality. Poirot recognises a young Scotland Yard detective in the crowd in evening dress and feels that <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on...|$|E

60|$|Thus appealed to, {{the chief}} gave {{it as his}} opinion that <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to happen, for the sky in the nor'-west looked uncommonly black. Having given {{utterance}} to this cautious remark he relapsed into silence.|$|R
