2500|$|The LeMat {{revolver}} was a [...]42 or [...]36 caliber cap & ball {{black powder}} revolver invented by Jean Alexandre LeMat of New Orleans, which featured an unusual secondary 20 gauge <b>smooth-bore</b> <b>barrel</b> capable of firing buckshot.

50|$|Early prototypes {{had very}} short <b>smooth-bore</b> <b>barrels</b> with 0.40 inch (10mm) bore and {{matching}} chambers but later versions have longer barrels {{of up to}} 4inches (100mm). QSPR ammunition (which pioneered the captive piston propellant gas containment system) ejected fifteen tungsten balls from the special cartridges, weighing 7.5 grain (0.5 grams) each, exiting at a muzzle velocity of ca. 730 fps (222ms) for a muzzle energy of ca. 135 ft-lbs (185J).|$|R
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, work {{began in the}} US to develop an {{eventual}} replacement to the M48 tank, the operational medium tank at the time. [...] A series of relatively simple upgrades to the T48 were considered {{as part of the}} T54 project, but these were considered to offer too little advantage to be worth it. Examples of more radical upgrades were also called for. In September 1954, out of many submitted plans, two main examples were chosen – one of them, the T95; the other, the T96, which used a heavier gun and a 105mm round. Both tanks used <b>smooth-bore</b> <b>barrels</b> with a fixed mount and no recoil system. In November 1956, it was finally decided that nine tanks would be produced. Four of them would be original T95s. One would be a T95 with a 90mm gun on a mount with a recoil system, receiving the designation T95E1. The remaining four would use the T95 chassis and the T96 turret, and were designated the T95E4.|$|R
2500|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{characteristic of}} LeMat's revolver {{is that its}} 9-shot cylinder revolves around a separate central barrel of larger caliber than the chambers in the cylinder proper. The central barrel is smooth-bore and can function as a short-barreled shotgun (hence the name [...] "Grape Shot Revolver") with the shooter selecting whether to fire from the cylinder or the <b>smooth-bore</b> <b>barrel</b> by flipping a lever {{on the end of}} the hammer. [...] Flipping the lever up caused the movable striker to fall upon the primer set directly under the hammer, discharging the lower barrel, while leaving it in the standard position would fire the chambers in the cylinder, much like any other revolver.|$|E
2500|$|LeMat {{originally}} chambered {{his pistol}} for [...]40 (or [...]42) caliber revolver bullets, with a [...]60 (20 gauge) <b>smooth-bore</b> <b>barrel,</b> {{and had a}} jointed ramrod (mounted {{on the right-hand side}} of the frame), which was used to load both barrels. [...] Later, during the American Civil War, a lighter [...]35-caliber pistol with a [...]55 caliber (28-gauge) smooth bore barrel was produced, but as these were non-standard ammunition sizes (.36 or [...]44 caliber were most common for contemporary revolvers) LeMat owners had to cast their own bullets (as opposed to being issued them from general military stores). [...] The final models of the LeMat were produced in [...]36 or [...]44 caliber in response to these criticisms, but too few of them managed to get past the Union blockade of the South during the Civil War to be of any real use.|$|E
50|$|Another {{option is}} to use a rifled choke in a <b>smooth-bore</b> <b>barrel,</b> at least for {{shotguns}} having a removable choke tube. Rifled chokes are considerably less expensive than a rifled shotgun barrel, and a <b>smooth-bore</b> <b>barrel</b> paired with a rifled choke is often nearly as accurate as a rifled shotgun barrel dedicated for use with slugs. There are many options in selecting shotguns for use with slugs.|$|E
5000|$|The Marble Game Getter is a light, double-barrel (over-under), {{combination}} gun {{manufactured by}} the Marble's Arms & Manufacturing Company in Gladstone, Michigan. [...] The firearm features a skeleton folding stock and a rifle <b>barrel</b> over a <b>smooth-bore</b> shotgun <b>barrel.</b> A manually pivoted hammer striker {{is used to}} select the upper or lower barrel. Three generations of the system were/are produced—First Generation (Model 1908), Second Generation (Model 1921) and the Third Generation currently manufactured by Marble Arms.|$|R
50|$|Large calibre APFSDS {{projectiles}} {{are usually}} fired from <b>smooth-bore</b> (unrifled) <b>barrels,</b> though {{they can be}} and often are fired from rifled guns. This is especially true when fired from small to medium calibre weapon systems. APFSDS projectiles are usually made from high-density metal alloys, such as tungsten heavy alloys (WHA) or depleted uranium (DU); maraging steel was used for some early Soviet projectiles. DU alloys are cheaper and have better penetration than others, as they are denser and self-sharpening. Uranium is also pyrophoric and may become opportunistically incendiary, especially as the round shears past the armor exposing non-oxidized metal, but both the metal's fragments and dust contaminate the battlefield with toxic hazards. The less toxic WHAs are preferred in most countries except the USA, and Russia.|$|R
40|$|Today's {{investigations}} on electrothermal-chemical (ETC) guns {{concentrate on}} different methods of electrothermal plasma ignition technologies {{to be combined}} with ETC tailored propellants and their charge designs. It is the goal to obtain increased gun performance in terms of muzzle energy, muzzle velocity, and temperature compensation of the propellants. In the German ETC program, governmental agencies, research institutes, and industry are involved to investigate proper ETC technologies to be applied in large-caliber guns. Basic investigations as well as large-caliber firing demonstrations {{are included in the}} program. It is the goal of the current ETC phase to demonstrate muzzle energies up to 15 MJ out of a 120 -mm <b>smooth-bore</b> gun <b>barrel</b> under operating conditions. This paper gives an overview of the program structure and briefly addresses the content of the subprograms performed in institutes {{as well as of the}} industrial investigations...|$|R
5000|$|Firearms which {{previously}} {{fell into}} a prohibited category, but have been converted to an otherwise permitted form. For example, a pistol which is adapted by permanently fitting a 60 cm long <b>smooth-bore</b> <b>barrel</b> to it does not thereby become permitted.|$|E
50|$|A mortar is {{a device}} that fires {{projectiles}} at low velocities and short ranges. The mortar has traditionally {{been used as a}} weapon to propel explosive mortar bombs in high-arcing ballistic trajectories. The weapon is typically muzzle-loading with a short, often <b>smooth-bore</b> <b>barrel,</b> generally less than 15 times its caliber. Modern mortars are light and easily portable. They can be used for close fire support with a variety of ammunition.|$|E

50|$|The 1937 Firearms Act {{incorporated}} various {{modifications to}} the 1920 Act based on the recommendations of a 1934 committee chaired by Sir Archibald Bodkin. The resulting legislation raised the minimum age for buying a firearm or airgun from 14 to 17, extended controls to shotguns and other <b>smooth-bore</b> weapons with <b>barrels</b> shorter than 20 in (later raised by the Firearms Act 1968 to 24 in, transferred certificates for machine guns to military oversight, regulated gun dealers, and granted chief constables the power to add conditions to individual Firearms Certificates.|$|R

50|$|It had {{a single}} 1.25 inches caliber <b>smooth-bore</b> <b>barrel.</b> The barrel was fed from a revolver-like ring, but with an axis of {{rotation}} perpendicular to the bore, rather than the usual revolver configuration with parallel axes. The cylinder housed 18 copper-lined chambers that were muzzle loaded from the outer side of the ring. The interior side of the multiple-chamber ring was lined with the corresponding 18 percussion cap nipples. The ring was rotated by a hand lever. The gun had a cast iron receiver.|$|E
50|$|Many repeating {{shotguns}} have barrels {{that can}} easily be removed and replaced in under a minute with no tools, so many hunters simply use an additional barrel for shooting slugs. Slug barrels will generally be somewhat shorter, have rifle type sights or a base for a telescopic sight, and may be either rifled or smooth bore. Smooth-bore shotgun barrels are quite a bit less expensive than rifled shotgun barrels, and Foster type slugs, as well as wad slugs, can work well up to 75 yards in a <b>smooth-bore</b> <b>barrel.</b> For achieving accuracy at 100 yards and beyond, however, a dedicated rifled slug barrel usually provides significant advantages.|$|E

5000|$|Gun laws in India are restrictive. The Arms Act of 1959 and the Arms Rules 1962 {{prohibit}} the sale, manufacture, possession, acquisition, import, export, and transport of firearms and ammunition unless under a licence, which {{is difficult to}} obtain. The Indian Government has a monopoly over the production and sale of firearms, {{with the exception of}} some breech-loading smooth-bore shotguns, of which a limited number may be produced and imported. The Arms Act classifies firearms into two categories: Prohibited Bore (PB) and Non-Prohibited Bore (NPB), where all semi-automatic and fully automatic firearms fall under the Prohibited Bore category. The Arms Act of 1962 added to the PB category any firearm which can chamber and fire ammunition of the caliber [...]303, 7.62 mm, [...]410, [...]380, [...]455, [...]45 rimless, or 9 mm. <b>Smooth-bore</b> guns having <b>barrels</b> shorter than 20 in are also specified as PB guns.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} combination {{guns were}} called swivel guns (not {{to be confused}} with the more widely known small cannon), which used a set of barrels designed to rotate to allow either the rifled or <b>smooth-bore</b> <b>barrel</b> to line up with a flintlock mechanism. [...] Modern combination guns tend to resemble double-barreled shotguns and double rifles, and are almost universally break open designs. Combination guns generally have a selector that allows the user to choose which barrel will fire. Drillings with two shotgun barrels and one rifle barrel may have two triggers, one for each shotgun barrel, and a selector that will allow one trigger to fire the rifle barrel. Four-barrel versions known as Vierlings generally have two triggers, and selectors to switch each between shotgun and rifle.|$|E
