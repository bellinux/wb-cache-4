40|$|What impact {{does the}} European Union (EU) have on good {{governance}} Romania? The analysis shows that EU-driven governance reforms improve <b>substantive</b> <b>legality</b> (the alignment of domestic legislation with international best standards), state capacity but weaken formal legality (the inner morality of law), {{many aspects of}} impartiality, efficiency-effectiveness and the coherence of state structures and policies. As a result, good governance is undermined. The persistence of bad governance is explained by three fundamental problems of Europeanization: 1. focus on quantity instead of quality, 2. partisan empowerment of change agents, 3. biased assessment of reform progress. The main argument is supported by an indicator-based analysis and qualitative interviews with representatives from the EU and Romania...|$|E
40|$|The {{principle}} of legitimacy {{as a state}} aims to protect the society, which is expressed in the {{principle of}} legality. While {{the purpose of the}} law is more fundamental justice. This principle is officially defined as what is just stated by the constitution. This definition however has been left by some developed countries which is according to them could not be extended in its application. Therefore the definition of the principle of legitimacy should be expanded comprehensively in order reach wider consequence in the law and constitution. <b>Substantive</b> <b>legality</b> principle holds that the main purpose of the law is that justice can be realized based on the laws that have a broader scope than just the law, so it should have been in Indonesia also have to switch the view of the use of formal legality principle to the principle of legality material...|$|E
40|$|What impact {{does the}} European Union (EU) {{have on the}} {{development}} of good governance in Romania? Does EU conditionality facilitate or hinder the transition towards good governance? This brief policy-oriented chapter argues that the EU’s promotion of good governance in Romania leads to some selective progress but, overall, to the persistence of bad governance. In particular, the paper shows that Romania’s process of Europeanisation has resulted in 1. some progress across three dimensions of governance (<b>substantive</b> <b>legality,</b> capacity and efficiency/effectiveness) but 2. regress in three others (formal legality, impartiality and coherence). In other words, reforms generate more substantive laws that are adapted to international/European standards (best practices), {{but at the same time}} the new laws become instable, incoherent (contradictory), hardly enforced and less general. In addition, reforms improve capacity (inputs) and partly efficiency (outputs) or effectiveness (outcomes) but undermine the procedural and structural aspects of government quality (impartiality, coherence), for instance through increased politicisation and fragmentation of the state structures. Overall, the analysis suggests that there is no transition towards good governance in Romania, despite selective progress...|$|E
40|$|In {{the area}} of {{constitutional}} law in Greece, where at least since 1975 {{there has been a}} well functioning democracy, the ideal of 'modernisation' must mean adherence to the <b>substantive</b> principles of <b>legality</b> {{and the rule of law}} as political ideals. Even though the Simitis government showed some concern for improvement in these areas, the constitutional amendment of 2001 did not attempt to tackle longstanding problems such as civil service corruption, irregularities in public procurement, the independence of the judiciary and the like. The amendment was motivated, it seems, by a more majoritarian 'communitarian' legal philosophy seeking to strengthen political majorities. © 2005 Taylor and Francis Group Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The article {{discusses}} the grounds {{on which a}} court of conciliation adjudicates, focusing upon the question whether this court is obliged to base its sentence upon the current substantive law regulations or whether it can take decisions {{solely on the basis}} of the principle o f rightfulness and discretion of decision. Can the arbitrators, not being bound by the norms of the substantive law, be guided only by their sense of equity, or do they have to observe the binding law, i. e. act in accordance with it and on the basis of it. The Author discusses extensively the notion of formal and <b>substantive</b> <b>legality,</b> shedding some light upon the views of doctrine and judicature on the issue of conciliation court’s obligation to observe the substantive law. By analysing articles 705, 711 § 3 and 712 § 1 point 4 of the Polish Code of Civil Proceedings, the Author arrives at the conclusion that in the light o f these provisions the view popular in the doctrine and law interpretation saying that courts of conciliation are not bound by the substantive law, is questionable and should be reconsidered...|$|E
40|$|While {{the last}} few years have seen a strong {{attention}} by international lawyers towards alleged breaches of Article 2 (4) of the UN Charter, much less attention has been devoted to the effects produced by such interventions upon the victim state. Article 2 (4) 's main function is arguably to protect the 'territorial integrity or political independence' of states, and the aims and effects of military interventions often undermine states' territorial sovereignty well after the cessation of the hostilities. The thesis sheds light {{on the extent to which}} international law protects states' and peoples' territorial sovereignty by studying the phenomenon of unlawful territorial situations. An unlawful territorial situation can be defined as a territorial occupation established and maintained as a result of a violation of international law, such as in the case of the illegal use of force. The thesis analyses unlawful territorial situations through the lenses of the legal-normative concepts of effectiveness, legality and legitimacy. The concept of effectiveness as a device for transforming effective realities into law was considered one of the fundamental principles of international law during the 19 th century and the first part of the 20 th century. It deeply influenced the notions of statehood and territorial sovereignty as inherited by contemporary international law. However, the second part of the 20 th century has seen the emergence of principles of <b>substantive</b> <b>legality</b> limiting the action of effectiveness as a source of territorial entitlement. The thesis shows how a situation of territorial unlawfulness can be defined with regard to four international legal principles: the prohibition against the change of territorial status through the use of force; uti possidetis iuris, self-determination; and territorial integrity. The thesis appraises the significance of effectiveness vis-a-vis these principles in the context of unlawful territorial situations. It argues that while effectiveness is no longer a fundamental principle of international law, it plays an important role when accompanied and enhanced by the legitimacy of the underlying claim, or by the external legitimation of an authoritative body, e. g. the Security Council. Whereas legitimacy is a concept supposedly built on the fundamental principles of the international community, it goes beyond positive legality, and it often represents a less objective, less transparent and less egalitarian device of power acceptance and recognition. However, adopting legitimacy as a device for transforming illegal effectiveness into a legal one, is paradoxically a way for the international community to safeguard the integrity of its principles of <b>substantive</b> <b>legality,</b> despite making them in some cases peripheral to the actual regulation of disputes...|$|E
40|$|Locus standi of non-privileged {{applicants}} {{to bring an}} action for annulment Abstract Every developed legal system is bound to have a mechanism for checking the procedural and <b>substantive</b> <b>legality</b> of measures adopted by its institutions. In the European Union it was of significant importance to create a system of control over the acts of the EU institutions given the democratic deficit within the Union and the limited supervisory role of the European Parliament. Binding acts of the EU institutions are subject to review through a number of routes provided by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and the Treaty on the European Union (TEU), namely action for annulment (Art. 263 TFEU), the plea of illegality (Art. 277 TFEU), the preliminary reference (Art. 267 TFEU) and the action for damages (Arts. 268 and 340 TFEU). The Court has consistently endeavoured to treat the several strands as a complex and coherent system of judicial review within the Union based on the rule of law. The action for annulment under Art. 263 TFEU plays a crucial role for individuals as it is in practice the only direct way open to individuals to challenge the acts of EU institutions. The main purpose of my thesis is to examine whether the current wording of Art. 263 (4) TFEU provides for individuals a sufficiently [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} the European Union (EU) {{on the development of the}} rule of law in Central and Eastern Europe. The topic is addressed through a mixed methods study which consists of a quantitative comparative analysis of three country groups from Central and Eastern Europe (1. Central Europe and the Baltics, CEB; 2. South Eastern Europe, SEE; 3. Commonwealth of Independent States, CIS) and three qualitative case studies on Poland, Romania and Moldova. The empirical analysis is based on an innovative set of indicators and revealing insights from numerous qualitative interviews. The findings of the study suggest that {{the impact of the}} EU is differential, both healthy and pathological. While EU-driven judicial reforms increase judicial capacity and align domestic legislation with European and international standards (<b>substantive</b> <b>legality),</b> they do not improve and even lead to a deterioration of judicial impartiality and formal legality, resulting in several reform pathologies, such as instable, incoherent and non-enforced laws and in more politicized and incoherent judicial systems, which undermine the development of the rule of law. These pathological effects occur mostly in weak rule of law countries from SEE (Romania) and CIS (Moldova), in contrast to more healthy effects in advanced, strong rule of law countries from CEB (Poland). The dissimilar development in the rule of law across countries is explained in relation to the conduct of reforms. Successful reformers like Poland, which consolidate the rule of law, have strong and independent horizontal accountability institutions (e. g. Constitutional Court, Ombudsman, judiciary), which mitigate or alleviate reform pathologies and ensure that reforms are conducted in an accountable, gradual and non-politicized way. Unsuccessful reformers, like Romania and Moldova, lack these independent checks on reformers and thus fail to establish the rule of law. Based on the findings from the case studies an original typology of healthy and pathological reform paths is proposed, which draws on the logic of circular and cumulative causation and emphasizes the mutual reinforcement between domestic conditions and the reform approach of transnational coalitions. The proposed typology implies that EU conditionality is not transformative, but rather reinforces existing healthy and pathological reform paths, thus cementing the existing divergence in the rule of law across post-communist countries. This thesis further makes several policy recommendations to remedy the pathological impact of donor-driven reforms...|$|E
