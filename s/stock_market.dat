5|$|Little was not {{the first}} to gain and lose his fortune in the <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> but he was a {{pioneering}} speculator, the first to rely on his ability to predict market fluctuations to inform his speculations instead of bidding with what would today be considered insider information. He was the first Great Bear; before his rapid rise speculation and market manipulation was virtually unknown in the <b>stock</b> <b>market,</b> as no one before him had had the still nerve and financial foresight necessary to profit from such risky endeavors, and many market historians consider him the first modern <b>stock</b> <b>market</b> tycoon. His ability to gain and lose fortunes on a day-by-day basis was a microcosm of the meteoric possibilities and insecurities of speculation, and after his death and even during his life many other investors tried to imitate his success, with little success. His victory over the Erie Railroad scheme (and market cornering activities in general) inspired similar plots in the years thereafter; in 1863 the industrialist Cornelius Vanderbilt successfully cornered the Harlem Railroad {{in much the same way}} that Little had done almost thirty years earlier, and fell into a corner trap formed by Daniel Drew and others himself in the later Erie War. This did much to give credence to convertible bonds, then still a novelty.|$|E

The empirical {{results show that the}} trading rules have stronger predictive power in the emerging <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> than in the developed <b>stock</b> <b>markets.</b> In addition, the short-term variants of the technical trading rules may be more useful in detecting the predictive ability of the technical trading rules. In examining the profitability of the technical trading rules, the study shows that transaction costs can eliminate the trading profits for most <b>stock</b> <b>markets.</b> The empirical results show that the technical trading rules are profitable in Thailand, Shenzhen, and Korea <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> after adjusting for transaction costs. There is no evidence of the profitability of the technical trading rules in other <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> after transaction costs. In order to investigate the relationship between market efficiency and the profitability of the technical trading rules, the study compares the excess returns between six developed <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> and six emerging <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> during the test period.

40|$|AbstractMany {{scientists}} and economists {{state that the}} degree of global integration of the Central and Eastern European countries (CEECs) <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> is very low. However, the recent turmoils in the major financial centers in USA, China, etc. raise the question about the possible transmission of the global shocks to the CEECs <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> despite the low degree of financial integration. The main research questions are: can the spillover effect transmit from the major <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> on the CEECs <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> and what type of shocks cause the cross-border contagion risk transmission to the CEECs <b>stock</b> <b>markets?</b> The objective of this study – to identify the transmission of global shocks through <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> channel in the CEECs. The research methods: the systemic, logical and comparative analysis of the scientific literature and statistical methods: Dynamic Conditional Correlation Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (DCC-GARCH) model. The empirical {{results of this study suggest}} that the highest degree of global and regional integration of the <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> was observed in Poland's, Czech Republic's, and Hungary's <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> that can be explained by higher development level of these <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> comparing to other CEECs. The collapse of Lehman Brothers bank in United States in 2008 was the most significant shock transmitted to CEECs <b>stock</b> <b>markets.</b> The empirical results also suggest that the transmission of other systemic shocks (e. g. the Middle East financial markets crash (May 2006), Greek debt crisis (April 23, 2010), Portugal's debt crisis (May 16, 2011)) was also observed on some of the CEECs countries...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFeed-back {{models in}} the <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> {{research}} imply an adjustment process toward investors’ expectation for current information and past experiences. Error-correction and cointegration are often {{used to evaluate the}} long-run relation. The Efficient Capital Market Hypothesis, which had ignored the effect of the accumulation of information, cannot explain some anomalies such as bubbles and partial predictability in the <b>stock</b> <b>markets.</b> In order to investigate the feed-back mechanism and to determine an effective model, we use daily data of the stock index of two Chinese <b>stock</b> <b>markets</b> with the expectational model, which is one kind of geometric lag models. Tests and estimations of error-correction show that long-run equilibrium seems to be seldom achieved in Chinese <b>stock</b> <b>markets.</b> Our result clearly shows the common coefficient of expectations and fourth-order autoregressive disturbance exist in the two Chinese <b>stock</b> <b>markets.</b> Furthermore, we find the same coefficient of expectations has an autoregressive effect on disturbances in the two Chinese <b>stock</b> <b>markets.</b> Therefore the presence of such feed-back is also supported in Chinese <b>stock</b> <b>markets...</b>|$|R
