40|$|Light {{pollution}} is currently {{one of the}} environmental problems of human society. With the technological development and the increase of the human population on the planet, the landscape is constantly increasing the emission of disturbing light into the surrounding area during the night. The largest producer of light {{pollution is}} the urban and suburban regions where light spreads to several decades away, increasing {{the brightness of the}} sky, as well as rural or nature-close landscapes. Exposure to disturbing light has a demonstrably unfavorable effect on human, animal and plant health {{as well as on the}} balance of whole ecosystems. In this work I focus on finding and assessing the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>sky</b> brightness in the interest zone of the observatory of Astronomical Institute AV at Ondřejov. Based on my own data measured in the field during nine night excursions, I created an interpolated map of ArcMap 10. 2 and, according to directional measurements, interpreted the main polluters in this area. The results clearly show a clear trend to reduce the sky's brightness from the northwest to the east. The measurements also show that the local sources of obstrusive light near Ondřejov have a slight influence on the overall zenith brightness of the sky compared to the presence of Prague, several miles away [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|Eukaryotic release factors 1 and 3, encoded by SUP 45 and SUP 35, respectively, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are {{required}} for translation termination. Recent studies have shown that, besides these two key factors, several genetic and epigenetic mechanisms modulate the efficiency of translation termination. These mechanisms, through modifying translation termination fidelity, were shown to affect various cellular processes, such as mRNA degradation, {{and in some cases}} could confer a beneficial phenotype to the cell. The most studied example of such a mechanism is [PSI+], the prion conformation of Sup 35 p, which can have pleiotropic effects on growth that vary among different yeast strains. However, genetic loci underlying such readthrough-dependent, background-specific phenotypes have yet to be identified. Here, we used sup 35 (C 653 R), a partial loss-of-function allele of the SUP 35 previously shown to increase readthrough of stop codons and recapitulate some [PSI+]-dependent phenotypes, to study the genetic basis of phenotypes revealed by increased translational readthrough in two divergent yeast strains: BY 4724 (a laboratory strain) and RM 11 _ 1 a (a wine strain). We first identified growth conditions in which increased readthrough of stop codons by sup 35 (C 653 R) resulted in different growth responses between these two strains. We then used a recently developed linkage mapping technique, extreme QTL mapping (X-QTL), to identify readthrough-dependent loci for the observed growth differences. We further showed that variation in SKY 1, an SR protein kinase, underlies a readthrough-dependent locus observed for growth on diamide and hydrogen peroxide. We found that the allelic <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>SKY</b> 1 interacts with readthrough level and the genetic background to determine growth rate in these two conditions...|$|E

50|$|This thesis {{was taken}} up again by the French author Guy Breton in his {{publication}} Les Beaux mensonges de l'histoire (The Beautiful Falsehoods of History).

In fact, it was not until seven years after the fact that one first heard of Mlle. Dodu. Guy Breton cites as reference general Aurelle de Paladines, {{commander in chief of the}} army of the Loire, who nowhere mentions that heroic salvation of his army. Lieutenant-colonel Rousset, author of a Histoire de la guerre Franco Allemande 1870-1871 (History of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871), never makes any reference to it, while he swarms with lively details up to and including the depth of the snow and the <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sky.</b> Neither the report of M.

40|$|Characterizations of {{short-term}} variability in solar radiation {{are required to}} successfully integrate large numbers of photovoltaic power systems into the electrical grid. Previous studies have used ground-based irradiance observations {{with a range of}} different temporal resolutions, and a systematic analysis of the effects of temporal averaging on the representation of variability is lacking. Using high-resolution surface irradiance data with original temporal resolutions between 0. 01  s and 1  s from six different locations in the Northern Hemisphere, we characterize the changes in representation of temporal variability resulting from time averaging. In this analysis, we condition all data to <b>states</b> <b>of</b> mixed <b>skies,</b> which are the most potentially problematic in terms of local PV power volatility. Statistics of clear-sky index k* and its increments Δ k* τ (i. e., normalized surface irradiance and changes therein over specified intervals of time) are considered separately. Our results indicate that a temporal averaging time scale of around 1  s marks a transition in representing single-point irradiance variability, such that longer averages result in substantial underestimates of variability. Higher-resolution data increase the complexity of data management and quality control without appreciably improving the representation of variability. The results do not show any substantial discrepancies between locations or seasons...|$|R
