All current approaches to program conditioning rely upon both <b>symbolic</b> execution and <b>reasoning</b> about <b>symbolic</b> predicates.

This paper reports on a lightweight approach to theorem proving using the FermaT Simplify decision procedure. This is used as a component to ConSUS, a program conditioning system for the Wide Spectrum Language WSL. The paper describes the symbolic execution algorithm used by ConSUS, which prunes as it conditions. The paper also provides empirical evidence that conditioning produces a significant reduction in program size and, although exponential in the worst case, the conditioning system has low degree polynomial behaviour in many cases, thereby making it scalable to unit level applications of program conditioning...|$|R
40|$|A {{promising}} {{approach to}} qualitative reasoningaboutmechanism kinematics is {{the theory of}} pace vocabu:aries. In this paper, we propose a new method of computing the place vocabulary representation. Thecomputation is split into the combinatorial manipulation of the symbolic information, and the evaluation of predicates on the metric dimensions by an abstract device, the metric diagram. This abstraction allows reasoning about mechanism behavior without reference to an explicit representation of the numeric dimensions of the parts. When the metric information is incomplete, the solution may contain ambiguities. When no metric information is available, {{the result is an}} ambiguous, but purely symbolic, place vocabulary.
