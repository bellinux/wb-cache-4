5|$|Mithra: The Mithra are a race {{of hunters}} who live {{alongside}} the Tarutaru in Windurst. They {{are known for their}} energy, curiosity, and their penchant for causing playful mischief. Due to a gender imbalance in their race males are a rarity, and <b>so</b> <b>only</b> female mithra leave the home, making females the only playable gender. Mithra possess high dexterity and agility, but lower HP and charisma. Mithra are cursed with envy.|$|E

5|$|According to modern-day analysis, a {{tropical}} depression {{developed in the}} Pacific Ocean, south of El Salvador, early on September 27. It drifted northward across Central America and eastern Mexico before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico near Ciudad del Carmen on September 30. Weather reports had indicated low air pressures over the area for several days. It is relatively rare for {{a tropical}} cyclone to cross from the Pacific into the Atlantic, or vice versa, and this storm is among less than a dozen known to have officially done <b>so.</b> <b>Only</b> three other tropical cyclones have crossed from the eastern Pacific into the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Caprioli's {{memorial}} {{was broken}} {{up in the}} nineteenth century, <b>so</b> <b>only</b> the Caprioli Adoration remains. A masterpiece of Cairano's, this was placed in 1841 by Rodolfo Vantini on the high altar of the St Francis of Assisi church. Cairano demonstrates a high technical mastery, {{not only in the}} extremely precise orientation of the boxes, but also in the choice of the monolithic block, which, in fact, is not strictly necessary for this kind of work. From Bernardino Faino and Francesco Paglia and other seventeenth and eighteenth century scholars, we know that the relief was placed by some architectural system. It {{was supposed to be a}} figurative piece, created perhaps by the same artist, but which has not been traced.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilian teeth {{vary from}} blunt and dull to sharp and needle-like. Broad-snouted species have teeth that vary in size, while those of slender-snouted species are more uniform. The teeth of {{crocodiles}} and gharials {{tend to be}} more visible than those of alligators and caimans when the jaws are closed. The easiest way to distinguish crocodiles from alligators is by looking at their jaw line. The teeth on the lower jaw of an alligator fit into sockets in the upper jaw, <b>so</b> <b>only</b> the upper teeth are visible when the mouth is closed. The teeth on the lower jaw of a crocodile fit into grooves {{on the outside of the}} top jaw making both the upper and lower teeth visible when the mouth is closed.|$|E
5|$|Frøen Station was rebuilt <b>so</b> <b>only</b> {{the trains}} on the Holmenkollen Line would stop there, while Nordberg Station was closed. All the stations, except Ullevål stadion, {{were built in}} the same {{architectural}} style. They are constructed in concrete with steel columns and wooden sheds and fences. All platforms have a shed; Ullevål stadion has a larger weather cover and has a design inspired by football. The upgrade also included the installation of third-rail from Majorstuen to Stortinget in the Common Tunnel. From 10 January 1993, the Sognsvann Line re-open, and from 4 April, the line started operating through the Common Tunnel and connected to the Lambertseter Line. The new service became operated with T1000 rolling stock.|$|E

5|$|Historians {{debate whether}} Washington {{preferred}} to fight major battles or to utilize a Fabian strategy to harass the British with quick, sharp attacks {{followed by a}} retreat so that the larger British army could not catch him. His southern commander Greene did use Fabian tactics in 1780–81; Washington did <b>so</b> <b>only</b> in fall 1776 to spring 1777, after losing New York City and seeing much of his army melt away. Trenton and Princeton were Fabian examples. By summer 1777 Washington had rebuilt his strength and his confidence; he stopped using raids and went for large-scale confrontations, as at Brandywine, Germantown, Monmouth, and Yorktown.|$|E
5|$|However, the two missionaries, who {{had become}} just as much explorers as they were missionaries, became quite {{interested}} in Kilimanjaro, and Krapf sought permission of the Mombasa governor for an expedition {{to the land of}} the Jagga, a people now known as the Chaga, who lived and live on the actual slopes of Kilimanjaro. Krapf told the governor that this journey would be work-based. Despite this, Krapf actually did not accompany Rebmann on the journey, <b>so</b> <b>only</b> Bwana Kheri and Rebmann left for Kilimanjaro on April 27, 1848.|$|E

Learning about these developments from Yen Sid, Master Eraqus sends Terra and Aqua to destroy the Unversed and find Xehanort throughout the countless worlds. Later, Xehanort's apprentice Vanitas convinces Ventus to follow Terra against Eraqus' wishes, while Eraqus orders Aqua to watch over Terra and bring Ventus back to the Land of Departure.|$|E
5|$|The {{solution}} advocated is transporting sulfates {{into the}} next higher layer of the atmosphere - stratosphere. Aerosols in the stratosphere last years instead of weeks - <b>so</b> <b>only</b> a relatively smaller (though still large) amount of sulfate emissions would be necessary, and side effects would be less. This would require developing {{an efficient way to}} transport large amounts of gases into stratosphere, many of which have been proposed though none are known to be effective or economically viable.|$|E
5|$|The {{variety of}} {{positivism}} that remains dominant today is termed instrumental positivism. This approach eschews epistemological and metaphysical concerns (such as {{the nature of}} social facts) in favour of methodological clarity, replicability, reliability and validity. This positivism {{is more or less}} synonymous with quantitative research, and <b>so</b> <b>only</b> resembles older positivism in practice. Since it carries no explicit philosophical commitment, its practitioners may not belong to any particular school of thought. Modern sociology of this type is often credited to Paul Lazarsfeld, who pioneered large-scale survey studies and developed statistical techniques for analysing them. This approach lends itself to what Robert K. Merton called middle-range theory: abstract statements that generalize from segregated hypotheses and empirical regularities rather than starting with an abstract idea of a social whole.|$|E

Yet when he finally confronts Mundus, {{who is about to}} kill Trish, Dante again chooses to save her and is injured. Mundus tries to finish him off, but Trish takes the attack instead. This unleashes Dante's full power, thus allowing him to take on the form of Sparda. Dante and Mundus then battle on another plane of existence.|$|E
5|$|After {{the work}} of John R. Carson in 1915 {{it became clear that}} {{multiplexed}} telephone transmissions could be greatly improved by the use of single sideband suppressed carrier (SSB) transmission. Compared to basic amplitude modulation (AM) SSB has the advantage of half the bandwidth and a fraction of the power (one sideband can have no more than 1/6 of the total power and would typically be a lot less). AM analysed in the frequency domain consists of a carrier and two sidebands. The carrier wave in AM represents the majority of the transmitted power but contains no information whatsoever. The two sidebands both contain identical information <b>so</b> <b>only</b> one is required, at least from an information transmission point of view. Up to this point filtering had been by simple tuned circuits. However, SSB required a flat response over the sideband of interest and maximum rejection of the other sideband with a very sharp transition between the two. As the idea was to put another (completely different) signal in the slot vacated by the unwanted sideband it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent crosstalk. At the same time minimum distortion (i.e. flat response) is obviously desirable for the sideband being retained. This requirement led to a big research effort in the design of electric wave filters.|$|E
5|$|After this match, Neil {{was called}} into the Australian Test team, <b>so</b> <b>only</b> Ray and Merv played in Victoria's next match against New South Wales. Mervagain captaining the sidemade a duck and was out before Ray came in, in Victoria's only innings of the match and was not {{selected}} {{for the remainder of}} the season. After this, Ray and Neil played together for Victoria on two occasions in the second half of the season when the latter did not have a match for Australia. In the first match, against New South Wales, the two batted in partnership for the first time for their state. Ray came in at 5/53 to join Neil and he fell for 9 to leave the score at 6/64 as Victoria collapsed to be all out for 130. In the second innings, Ray joined Neil with the score at 5/266 and the latter fell at 6/292, ending a 26-run partnership. The pair did not bat together in the second match against South Australia as Neil was out before Ray came in on both occasions. The 1947-48 was the most productive for the Harveys as a combination for Victoria until Ray played a full season in 1953-54 together with Neil.|$|E
