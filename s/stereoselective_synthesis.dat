500|$|Amphetamine is a methyl homolog of the {{mammalian}} neurotransmitter phenethylamine {{with the}} chemical formula [...] [...] The carbon atom {{adjacent to the}} primary amine is a stereogenic center, and amphetamine is composed of a racemic 1:1 mixture of two enantiomeric mirror images. [...] This racemic mixture can be separated into its optical isomers: levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine. At room temperature, the pure free base of amphetamine is a mobile, colorless, and volatile liquid with a characteristically strong amine odor, and acrid, burning taste. [...] Frequently prepared solid salts of amphetamine include amphetamine aspartate, hydrochloride, phosphate, saccharate, and sulfate, the last {{of which is the}} most common amphetamine salt.

2500|$|In {{the later}} {{half of the}} twentieth century, chemists began to develop methods of {{stereoselective}} catalysis and kinetic resolution whereby reactions could be directed to produce only one enantiomer rather than a racemic mixture. Early examples include stereoselective hydrogenations (e.g., as reported by William Knowles and Ryōji Noyori, and functional group modifications such as the asymmetric epoxidation of Barry Sharpless; for these specific [...] achievements, these workers were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2001. Such reactions gave chemists a much wider choice of enantiomerically pure molecules to start from, where previously only natural starting materials could be used. Using techniques pioneered by Robert B. Woodward and new developments in synthetic methodology, chemists became more able to take simple molecules through to more complex molecules without unwanted racemisation, by understanding stereocontrol, allowing final target molecules to be synthesised pure enantiomers (i.e., without need for resolution). [...] Such techniques are referred to as <b>stereoselective</b> <b>synthesis.</b>|$|E
