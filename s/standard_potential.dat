5|$|Americium is {{paramagnetic}} {{in a wide}} temperature range, {{from that}} of liquid helium, to room temperature and above. This behavior is markedly {{different from that of}} its neighbor curium which exhibits antiferromagnetic transition at 52K. The thermal expansion coefficient of americium is slightly anisotropic and amounts to (7.5± 0.2)/°C along the shorter a axis and (6.2± 0.4)/°C for the longer c hexagonal axis. The enthalpy of dissolution of americium metal in hydrochloric acid at standard conditions is −620.6± 1.3kJ/mol, from which the standard enthalpy change of formation (ΔfH°) of aqueous Am3+ ion is −621.2± 2.0kJ/mol−1. The <b>standard</b> <b>potential</b> Am3+/Am0 is −2.08 ± 0.01V.|$|E
5|$|Between 70K {{and room}} temperature, {{berkelium}} behaves as a Curie–Weiss paramagnetic material with an effective magnetic moment of 9.69Bohr magnetons (µB) and a Curie temperature of 101K. This magnetic moment is almost {{equal to the}} theoretical value of 9.72µB calculated within the simple atomic L-S coupling model. Upon cooling to about 34K, berkelium undergoes a transition to an antiferromagnetic state. Enthalpy of dissolution in hydrochloric acid at standard conditions is −600kJ/mol−1, from which the standard enthalpy change of formation (ΔfH°) of aqueous Bk3+ ions is obtained as −601kJ/mol−1. The <b>standard</b> <b>potential</b> Bk3+/Bk0 is −2.01V. The ionization potential of a neutral berkelium atom is 6.23eV.|$|E

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{study of}} the redox properties of six parent quinones {{has been carried out}} using quantum chemistry methods. The reduction of the ortho (o-) and para (p-) isomers of benzoquinone and naphthoquinone, 9, 10 - anthraquinone and 9, 10 -phenantrenequinone to the corresponding hydroquinones and semiquinone radicals was investigated at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 +G(d,p) level of theory. Thermodynamic functions in the gas-phase were calculated for all the reduction reactions. Gibbs energies of reaction and <b>standard</b> <b>potentials</b> in water for the reductions were determined using the IEF-PCM model and an empirical correction to the calculations based on the limited thermodynamic data available for the quinones. Potentials were calculated both for the direct reduction to the quinols, and for the two-step reduction via the neutral semiquinones. The calculated potentials for the 2 e-, 2 H+ reductions were found in good agreement with experiment and to display the same trends as gas-phase enthalpies and energies, i. e., to correlate with the number of C=C double bonds, {{as well as on the}} relative position of the C=O groups. The small deviations between experiment and theoretically predicted <b>standard</b> <b>potentials</b> were found to originate from basis set incompleteness and the shortcomings in the B 3 LYP exchange correlation functional rather than the models used for the thermochemical calculations or description of solvation. Accurate theoretical shifts in <b>standard</b> <b>potentials</b> for the p-/o- pairs of Q HQ and HQ H 2 Q reactions are presented and compared to experiment.

25|$|The SHE {{electrode}} can {{be connected}} to any other electrode by a salt bridge to form a cell. If the second electrode is also at standard conditions, then the measured cell potential is called the <b>standard</b> electrode <b>potential</b> for the electrode. The <b>standard</b> electrode <b>potential</b> for the SHE is zero, by definition. The polarity of the <b>standard</b> electrode <b>potential</b> provides information about the relative reduction potential of the electrode compared to the SHE. If the electrode has a positive potential {{with respect to the}} SHE, then that means it is a strongly reducing electrode which forces the SHE to be the anode (an example is Cu in aqueous CuSO4 with a <b>standard</b> electrode <b>potential</b> of 0.337 V). Conversely, if the measured potential is negative, the electrode is more oxidizing than the SHE (such as Zn in ZnSO4 where the <b>standard</b> electrode <b>potential</b> is −0.76 V).|$|R
2500|$|The {{standard}} {{electrode potential}} E0 against standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) is 0.230V ± 10mV. The potential is however very sensitive to traces of bromide ions which make it more negative.

50|$|The {{larger the}} value of the <b>standard</b> {{reduction}} <b>potentials,</b> the easier it is for the element to be reduced (accept electrons); in other words, they are better oxidizing agents. For example, F2 has 2.87 V and Li+ has −3.05 V. F reduces easily and is therefore a good oxidizing agent. In contrast, Li(s) would rather undergo oxidation (hence a good reducing agent). Thus Zn2+ whose <b>standard</b> reduction <b>potential</b> is −0.76 V can be oxidized by any other electrode whose <b>standard</b> reduction <b>potential</b> is greater than −0.76 V (e.g. H+(0 V), Cu2+(0.16 V), F2(2.87 V)) and can be reduced by any electrode with <b>standard</b> reduction <b>potential</b> less than −0.76 V (e.g. H2(−2.23 V), Na+(−2.71 V), Li+(−3.05 V)).|$|R

50|$|The {{slope of}} the line {{therefore}} represents the <b>standard</b> <b>potential</b> between two oxidation states. In other words, the steepness of the line shows the tendency for those two reactants to react and form the lowest-energy product. There is a possibility of having either a positive or negative slope. A positive slope between two species indicates a tendency for an oxidation reaction, while a negative slope between two species indicates a tendency for reduction. For example, if the manganese in HMnO4− has an oxidation state of +6 and nE° = 4, and in MnO2 the oxidation state is +4 and nE° = 0, then the slope Δy/Δx is 4/2 = 2, yielding the <b>standard</b> <b>potential</b> of +2.

In addition, any nonstoichiometry in the Fe(III)-Fe(II) range is titrated directly with no additives, any nonstoichiometry below Fe2+ will reduce 1 M FeCl3 whereas any nonstoichiometry above Fe3+ will oxidize Mohr’s salt.
