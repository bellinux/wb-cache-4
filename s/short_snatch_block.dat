40|$|Log {{bunching}} with winches {{is still}} popular in small scale forest operations, and where machine traffic {{is confined to}} widely spaced designated trails. Like all tree handling methods, winching has a potential to incur residual stand damage, especially when harvested trees need to be moved around a dense residual stand. <b>Snatch</b> <b>blocks</b> are special pulleys designed for changing the pulling direction, in order to maneuver the winch load around obstacles. This study was aimed at determining the effect of using a <b>snatch</b> <b>block</b> on stand damage and work productivity. Using a <b>snatch</b> <b>block</b> allowed reducing by one quarter the frequency of wounded trees, which dropped from 50 % to 36 %. The <b>snatch</b> <b>block</b> was especially effective in preventing damage to dominant trees. No significant difference was recorded for wound size and wound severity. Survival of advance regeneration was significantly higher when using a <b>snatch</b> <b>block.</b> When no block was used, {{almost half of the}} saplings were lost. In contrast, only one sapling out of four was lost when using a <b>snatch</b> <b>block.</b> Using a <b>snatch</b> <b>block</b> did not cause any significant change of work productivity. Lower incidence of hang-up delays and faster pulling fully offset the time required to rig the <b>snatch</b> <b>block.</b> The study did not include ergonomics, and could not indicate how operator workload was affected by adding the weight of a <b>snatch</b> <b>block</b> to that of the cable and chain rigging. © 2012 Elsevier B.

50|$|During {{daylight}} hours, healthy tawny frogmouths {{generally do}} not actively look for food though they may sit with their mouths open, snapping it shut when an insect enters. As dusk approaches, they begin actively searching for food. Tawny frogmouths feed mainly by pouncing from a tree or other elevated perch to take large insects or small vertebrates from the ground using their beaks with great precision. Some smaller prey, such as moths, can be caught in flight. Foraging flights consist of <b>short</b> <b>snatching</b> flights to foliage, branches, or into the air.|$|R

60|$|In cutting {{away the}} masts, {{it had been}} utterly {{impossible}} to observe the necessary precaution of commencing with the lee rigging, that being, from {{the position of the}} ship, completely under water. The masts and spars, therefore, being linked to the wreck by the shrouds and the rigging, remained alongside for four days. During all this time the ship lay rolling in the trough of the sea, the heavy surges breaking over her, and the spars heaving and banging to and fro, bruising the half-drowned sailors that clung to the bowsprit and the stumps of the masts. The sufferings of these poor fellows were intolerable. They stood to their waists in water, in imminent peril of being washed off by every surge. In this position they dared not sleep, lest they should let go their hold and be swept away. The only dry place on the wreck was the bowsprit. Here they took turns to be tied on, for half an hour at a time, and in this way gained <b>short</b> <b>snatches</b> of sleep.|$|R

6000|$|And {{why must}} sincerity {{be one of}} the {{essentials}} of prayer which is accepted of God, but because sincerity carries the soul in all simplicity to open its heart to God, and to tell him the case plainly, without equivocation; to condemn itself plainly, without dissembling; to cry to God heartily, without complimenting. [...] "I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou has chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke" [...] (Jer 31:18). Sincerity is the same in a corner alone, as it is before the face of the world. It knows not how to wear two vizards, one for an appearance before men, and another for a <b>short</b> <b>snatch</b> in a corner; but it must have God, and be with him in the duty of prayer. It is not lip-labour that it doth regard, for it is the heart that God looks at, and that which sincerity looks at, and that which prayer comes from, if it be that prayer which is accompanied with sincerity.|$|R
500|$|Apart from a {{juvenile}} fantasia for violin and piano, Smetana composed only four chamber works, yet {{each had a}} deep personal significance. The Piano Trio in G minor of 1855 was composed {{after the death of}} his daughter Bedřiška; its style is close to that of Robert Schumann, with hints of Liszt, and the overall tone is elegiac. It was 20years before he returned to the chamber genre with his first String Quartet. This E minor work, subtitled From My Life, was autobiographical in character, illustrating the composer's youthful enthusiasm for his art, his friendships and loves and, in a change of mood, the onset of his deafness represented by a long harmonic E in the final movement above ominous string tremolos. His second String Quartet, in D minor, written in 1882–83 in defiance of his doctor's orders to refrain from all musical activity, was composed in <b>short</b> <b>snatches,</b> [...] "a swirl of music of a person who has lost his hearing." [...] It represents Smetana's frustrations with his life, but is not wholly gloomy, and includes a bright polka. It was one of his final compositions; between the two quartets he wrote a violin and piano duet From the homeland, a mixture of melancholy and happiness with strong affinity to Czech folk material.|$|R

[...] Also quarters over stretches of river or lakes and fish too heavy to lift may be dragged to bank to devour. It is also dynamic in prey pursuit and can catch fish in rough water such as rapids.

A cloud seals the city of reason or rests upon the sea of imagination; a dream that darkens as much, {{whether it is a}} {{nightmare}} of atheism or a daydream of idolatry. And just as we have all sprung from sleep with a start and found ourselves saying some sentence that has no meaning, save in the mad tongues of the midnight; so the human mind starts from its trances of stupidity with some complete phrase upon its lips; a complete phrase which is a complete folly. Unfortunately it is not like the dream sentence, generally forgotten in the putting on of boots or the putting in of breakfast. This senseless aphorism, invented when man's mind was asleep, still hangs on his tongue and entangles all his relations to rational and daylight things. All our controversies are confused by certain kinds of phrases which are not merely untrue, but were always unmeaning; which are not merely inapplicable, but were always intrinsically useless. We recognise them wherever a man talks of [...] "the survival of the fittest," [...] meaning only the survival of the survivors; or wherever a man says that the rich [...] "have a stake in the country," [...] as if the poor could not suffer from misgovernment or military defeat; or where a man talks about [...] "going on towards Progress," [...] which only means going on towards going on; or when a man talks about [...] "government by the wise few," [...] as if they could be picked out by their pantaloons. [...] "The wise few" [...] must mean either the few whom the foolish think wise or the very foolish who think themselves wise.|$|R
