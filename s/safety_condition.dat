The post, written on August 1, 2010 with obscene words by the Russian user top-lap, who introduced himself as Alexander, criticised the fire <b>safety</b> <b>condition</b> in his native village during the 2010 Russian wildfires and emphasized the disappearance of the village's old fire alarm bell, which top-lap called [...] "rynda" [...] (a ship's bell in Russian). Top-lap asked to support his appeal, directed to the authorities of Kalyazinsky District in Russia's Tver Oblast. The post was spotted by the Echo of Moscow's editor-in-chief Alexei Venediktov on August 1. According to Venediktov, he [...] "saw that this message contains not only a money request or criticism of authorities, but a proposal to organize a voluntary fire guard if discounts are offered" [...] and [...] "it appeared as something new" [...] to him. Venediktov forwarded the post with his accompanying commentary on August 2. Putin's reply was e-mailed two days later. The rynda was ultimately installed, although top-lap claimed he was visited by the authorities who took his USB flash drives and hard drive, that reportedly stored nothing but video games.|$|E

However, it is well documented that the <b>safety</b> <b>condition</b> is trivially satisfied in cases where the subject believes in a necessary truth. This is {{for the simple reason that}} a necessary truth is true in all possible worlds, and therefore it is true in all possible worlds where it is believed.

30|$|Unidirectional two-lane freeway is {{a typical}} and the {{simplest}} form of freeway. The traffic flow characteristics including <b>safety</b> <b>condition</b> on two-lane freeway is of great significance in planning, design, and management of a freeway. Many previous traffic flow models are {{able to figure out}} flow characteristics such as speed, density, delay, and so forth. These models, however, have great difficulty in reflecting <b>safety</b> <b>condition</b> of vehicles. Besides, for the cellular automation, {{one of the most widely}} used microscopic traffic simulation models, its discreteness in both time and space can possibly cause inaccuracy or big errors in simulation results. In this paper, a micro-simulation model of two-lane freeway vehicles is proposed to evaluate characteristics of traffic flow, including <b>safety</b> <b>condition.</b> The model is also discrete in time but continuous in space, and it divides drivers into several groups on the basis of their preferences for overtaking, which makes the simulation more aligned with real situations. Partial test is conducted in this study and results of delay, speed, volume, and density indicate the preliminary validity of our model, based on which the proposed safety coefficient evaluates <b>safety</b> <b>condition</b> under different flow levels. It is found that the results of this evaluation coincide with daily experience of drivers, providing ground for effectiveness of the safety coefficient.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to develop a methodological {{procedure}} for supporting decision makers in transport planning. The methodology is adopted for evaluating <b>safety</b> <b>conditions</b> in a road infrastructure. Public administrations need to reduce road accidents and injuries, so as to reduce the social costs of transport. However dwindling financial resources for road maintenance call for targeted interventions to achieve the best results, optimizing resources for the most critical sections. In this analysis, the multicriteria method Electre III is used, a ranking procedure applied in the specific case to a suburban road system. The analysis provides some indications for choosing and ranking the most critical sections of the network. The <b>safety</b> <b>conditions</b> of an infrastructure of roads can be determined as a function of accidents, injuries, fatalities and exposure to risk and depend on road and traffic characteristics. In this analysis <b>safety</b> <b>conditions</b> for each road section are measured on the basis of several criteria including number of accidents, state of road maintenance, curvature, grade, access-point density. Values of the criteria are obtained from on-site measurements. This analysis is based on a comparison of criteria and alternatives. It identifies priorities for safety interventions. The road sections have been hierarchically ranked, according to the priority of interventions for improving <b>safety</b> <b>conditions...</b>|$|R
