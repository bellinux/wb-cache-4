25|$|Sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STI), {{also referred}} to as <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>diseases</b> (<b>STD)</b> and venereal diseases (VD), are infections that are commonly spread by sex, especially vaginal intercourse, anal sex or oral sex. Most STIs initially do not cause symptoms. This results in a greater risk of passing the disease on to others. Symptoms and signs of disease may include vaginal discharge, penile discharge, ulcers on or around the genitals, and pelvic pain. STIs acquired before or during birth may result in poor outcomes for the baby. Some STIs may cause problems with the ability to get pregnant.|$|E

Their mean age was 27 years. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) was identified in 68 of 81 (84 %) patients whose smears showed dyskaryosis and who underwent biopsy. CIN was also detected in 14 of 41 (34 %) patients who underwent biopsy and whose repeat smears were reported as giving normal results. The value of assessing two consecutive smears was evident, however, because none of the 99 patients with CIN had two normal smear results consecutively. Patients requiring treatment underwent laser ablation, which was provided in the department of gynaecology. These results show that colposcopy plays a vital part in managing patients with abnormal smears and indicate that genitourinary physicians need to give priority to developing colposcopy services in their specialty...|$|R

A questionnaire form and State-Trait anxiety scale were appilied to determine the knowledge level of <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>diseases</b> and the anxiety levels of these women. Results: <b>Sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>diseases</b> knowledge point average was found as medium level in the study group and low level in control group. It has been determined that all women know HIV/AIDS among the most related to the <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>diseases</b> and that they acquire this knowledge from press and health personnel. It was found that both of groups had a medium level of anxiety. No relation between the <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>diseases</b> knowledge points and conditional anxiety points of both groups has been determined.

40|$|Abstract Background : This study {{examines}} {{factors that are}} more associated with risk of <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> bacterial and viral diseases in {{a representative sample of}} American adults. Methods : This is a cross sectional study using secondary data from the 2007 - 2010 National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) data. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) is the software used in analysis of descriptive data and logistic regression models. Univariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine associations between risk factors and <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>diseases.</b> Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine associations between risk factors and <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>diseases</b> while controlling for confounders. A forward stepwise logistic regression analysis was to determine the best predictors of each type of <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>diseases.</b> Results : The sample size for the study population is n= 9, 216. There were four observed risk factors that were significantly associated with both bacterial <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>diseases</b> as well as viral <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>diseases</b> at the 0. 05 level of probability. Lack of health insurance was associated with 1. 66 increased odds of <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> viral <b>disease</b> compared to 1. 55 increased odds seen in <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> bacterial <b>disease.</b> History of birth control was associated with 2. 61 and 1. 66 increased odds in <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> bacterial <b>disease</b> and <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> viral <b>disease,</b> respectively. Having first sexual encounter in adulthood was associated with 3. 01 increased odds in <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> bacterial <b>disease</b> and 1. 72 times increased odds in <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> viral <b>diseases.</b> Multiple sexual partners was associated with decreased odds in both <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> bacterial and viral <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> <b>diseases.</b> Conclusions : The results of this study indicating differences in factors that are associated with <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> bacteria <b>diseases</b> and <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> viral <b>diseases</b> provide evidence for developing public health intervention that is based on type of infection. Public health intervention programs that address sex education, effect of IV drug use, the importance of health insurance, the use of birth control, circumcision, and smoking cessation may help to curb the prevalence of both <b>sexually</b> <b>transmitted</b> bacterial and viral infections in at-risk groups...|$|R
