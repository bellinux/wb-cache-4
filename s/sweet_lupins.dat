50|$|Like other legumes, the {{narrow-leaved lupin}} fixes {{nitrogen}} in a symbiotic interaction with different {{bacteria in the}} rhizosphere. Bacteria living in this rhizosphere include Bradyrhizobium lupinii or the newly discovered species Kribbella lupini.The narrow-leaved lupin is an erect, branching herb sometimes exceeding one meter. There are reduced-branching cultivars. Each palmate leaf is divided into 5 to 9 linear leaflets under 4 centimeters long. The herbage is slightly hairy in some areas. The inflorescence bears many flowers in shades of blue, violet, pink, or white. The fruit is a legume pod containing seeds of varying colors from dark gray to brown to white, or speckled or mottled.Lupinus angustifolius has a high content of alkaloids, e.g. lupanin or angustifolin. However, cultivars with a low alkaloid content have been bred. These low alkaloid cultivars are called <b>sweet</b> <b>lupins.</b>|$|E

40|$|Swine {{dysentery}} (SD) is a contagious mucohaemorrhagic {{diarrhoeal disease}} with severe impacts on production efficiency in grower/finisher pigs.

40|$|The {{nutritional}} value of faba beans (Vicia faba), Australian <b>sweet</b> <b>lupins</b> (Lupinus angustifolius), white lupins (Lupinus albus) and peas (Pisum sativum) grown in New Zealand for broilers were evaluated {{in terms of}} their nutritional characteristics, protein quality (protein efficiency ratio), apparent metabolisable energy, apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids and the effects on bird performance. The effects of dehulling and extrusion cooking on the nutritive value of legumes were also investigated. The first experiment discussed in Chapter 3 evaluated the effect of cultivars on the nutrient profile and protein quality of chickpeas (Cicer arietinum), Australian <b>sweet</b> <b>lupins,</b> peas and soybeans (Glycine max). With the exception of white lupins, cultivars had no effect on the proximate and fibre composition of grain legumes. Starch was the primary carbohydrate component of chickpeas and peas, whilst non-starch polysaccharides were the major carbohydrates in lupins. The legume proteins were deficient in lysine, methionine, cystine and threonine. No differences were found in protein quality between cultivars of the different grain legume species. The lowest weight gain and protein efficiency ratio, in addition to the highest relative pancreatic weight and mortality rate was found in raw soybeans, suggesting that soybeans contained high a concentration of anti-nutritional factors, such as protease inhibitors. Birds fed chickpeas, lupins and peas had a low mortality rate and relative pancreatic weight, confirming that the level of anti-nutrients in these legume seeds was low. The apparent metabolisable energy and apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids of faba beans, Australian <b>sweet</b> <b>lupins,</b> white lupins and peas were determined in the second experiment (Chapter 4). Cultivar effect on the apparent metabolisable energy values was observed only for faba beans and white lupins. Faba beans, white lupins and peas had comparable apparent metabolisable energy values, but these values were higher than those of Australian <b>sweet</b> <b>lupins,</b> and lower than that of soybean meal. No cultivar differences were found in the apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids of grain legumes. The apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids of both lupin species was found to be comparable to that of soybean meal. The effects of feeding diets containing 200 g/kg faba beans, lupins or peas on the performance, digestive tract development and litter quality of broilers were investigated in the third and fourth trials. In the cage trial (Chapter 5), the results showed that the weight gain of birds fed diets containing grain legumes was similar to that of control diet. Feed intake and feed per gain of birds fed diets containing the majority of grain legume cultivars did not differ from those fed the maize-soy diet. Birds fed diets containing faba beans had more dry and friable excreta compared to other treatment diets. The performance of birds fed diets containing 200 g/kg grain legumes during the 35 d grow-out period, in the floor pen trial (Chapter 6), confirmed the results of the cage trial. In this trial, weight gain and feed per gain of birds fed diets without meat meal were superior to those with meat meal. In cage trials, the modification of some segments of digestive tract development was probably due to the dietary NSP. Whilst in floor pen trial, digestive tract development was not influenced by the inclusion of grain legumes. The effect of methodology of determination (direct vs. difference method) on the apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids of wheat, maize, Australian <b>sweet</b> <b>lupins,</b> peas and soybean meal for broilers was evaluated in the fifth study (Chapter 7). The influence of methodology on apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids was found to vary amongst the feed ingredients. In general, the apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids of test ingredients determined by the difference method was higher than those determined by the direct method, suggesting that the use of the direct method may underestimate the apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of amino acids in low and medium protein ingredients. Data reported in Chapter 8 shows that dehulling increased the apparent metabolisable energy values of faba beans and Australian <b>sweet</b> <b>lupins,</b> but it had no beneficial effect on peas. The increase of apparent metabolisable energy values may be attributed to the decrease in non-starch polysaccharides of these legume seeds after dehulling. The removal of hulls increased the amino acid concentrations, but it had no effect on the apparent ileal digestibility coefficient of most amino acids. These results suggest that dehulling of grain legumes would be nutritionally beneficial and, likely to be economical in view of the improved amino acid concentrations and energy values. The final experiment (Chapter 9) demonstrated that extrusion of peas markedly influenced the content of crude protein, non-starch polysaccharides, starch, and trypsin inhibitors. The soluble non-starch polysaccharides and trypsin inhibitor contents of the majority of extruded pea samples were higher than those of raw peas, but insoluble and total non-starch polysaccharides decreased with extrusion. Extrusion had no effect on the apparent ileal protein digestibility and the apparent metabolisable energy of peas, but it increased ileal starch digestibility...|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} perceived that {{high quality energy}} and protein sources in diets for newly-weaned pigs, such as milk powders, lactose and cooked cereals, promote better performance after weaning. However, their higher cost and stability of supply sometimes requires nutritionists to explore potential for other ingredients {{for use in the}} formulation of weaner diets. Recent research in grower pigs demonstrated that lupins could be included at up to 350 g/kg in place of soybean meal, without compromising growth, carcase composition or meat quality (Kim et al., 2007). However, the use of lupins in a weaner diet to reduce or replace more expensive protein sources, such as milk products, has not been examined to date.

40|$|Despite lupins (Lupinus angustifolius) {{being an}} {{economical}} plant protein ingredient to feed growing and finishing pigs in Australia, {{the presence of}} anti-nutritional factors such as oligosaccharides and non-starch polysaccharides has generally restricted high inclusion levels in diets.

40|$|White lupin (Lupinus albus L.) is {{an ancient}} {{traditional}} multipurpose crop in Ethiopia.

Fourteen sweet lupin cultivars and two bitter cultivars including the Local Landrace (from white, blue and yellow lupin species) were tested in a randomized complete block design with three replications in the summer 2009. Except with yellow entry at Kossober- 1 location, the Local Landrace either had similar (P ≥ 0. 0513) or significantly higher (P ≤ 0. 0316) forage yield than white, yellow and blue entries in the other three locations.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to test bitter and <b>sweet</b> <b>lupin</b> seeds for lipid-lowering and for their antioxidative activities in hypercholesterolemic rats. The levels of plasma lipid, malondialdehyde (MDA) and whole blood reduced glutathione (GSH), as well as the activities of transaminases (ALT and AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in plasma, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in erythrocytes and plasma glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and catalase (CAT) were examined. A hypercholesterolemia-induced diet manifested in the elevation of total lipids (TL), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), LDL-C and MDA levels, ALT, AST, LDH activities and the depletion of GSH and enzymic antioxidants. The supplementation of a hypercholesterolemia-induced diet with bitter and <b>sweet</b> <b>lupin</b> seeds significantly lowered the plasma levels of TL, TC, TG and LDL-C. ALT, AST and LDH activities slightly decreased in treated groups compared with the hypercholesterolemic group (HC). Furthermore, the content of GSH significantly increased while MDA significantly decreased in treated groups compared with the HC group. In addition, the bitter lupin seed group improved enzymic antioxidants compared with the HC group. In general, the results indicated that the bitter lupin seed supplements are better than those containing <b>sweet</b> <b>lupin</b> seeds. These results suggested that the hypocholesterolemic effect of bitter and <b>sweet</b> <b>lupin</b> seed supplements might be due to their abilities to lower the plasma cholesterol level as well as to slow down the lipid peroxidation process and to enhance the antioxidant enzyme activity. Este estudio fue diseñado para evaluar semillas de altramuces dulces y amargas como agentes que bajan los lípidos y estudiar su efecto en la actividad antioxidante en ratas hipercolesterolémicas. El nivel de lípidos en plasma, malondialdehido (MDA) y glutatión reducido (GSH), así como la actividad transaminasa (ALT y AST), lactato deshidrogenasa (LHD) en plama, superóxido dismutasa (SOD) y glutatión peroxidasa (GPx) en eritrocitos, glutatión reductasa (GR) en plasma, glutatión-S- trnasferasa (GST) y catalasa (CAT) fueron examinadas. La dieta inductora de hipercolesterolemia se manisfesto mediante la elevación de los lípidos totales (TL), del colesterol total (TC), de los triglicéridos, de la LDL-C y de los niveles de MDA, de las actividades ALT, AST, LDH y del descenso de GSH y enzimas antioxidantes. La suplementación de dietas inductoras de hipercolesterolemia con semillas de altramuces dulces y amargas bajo significativamente los niveles en plasma de TL, TC, TG y LDL-C. Las actividades ALT, AST y LDH decrecieron ligeramente en grupos tratados comparados con el grupo hipercolesterolémico (HC). Por otra parte, el contenido de GSH aumento significativamente mientras que el MDA decreció significativamente en los grupos tratados comparados con el grupo HC. Además, las semillas de altramuces amargas mejoraron las enzimas antioxidantes comparadas con el grupo HC. En general, los resultados indican que, el suplemento con semillas amargas es mejor que con semillas de altramuces dulces. Estos resultados sugieren que el efecto hipercolesterolémico del suplemento con semillas de altramuces dulces y amargas podrían ser debiadas a su capacidad para bajar los nivleles en plasma de colesterol, así como una ralentización del proceso de peroxidación lipídica y un aumento de la actividad enzimática antioxidante...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MScAgric (Animal Sciences)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. The {{demand for}} protein for {{human and animal}} {{nutrition}} in South Africa is increasing and it will continuously increase. The effect of replacing soybean oilcake meal as protein source for broilers and full-fat soybean meal for weaner pigs, with different levels of <b>sweet</b> <b>lupins</b> (Lupinus angustifolius), canola oilcake and full-fat canola was examined. A basal diet with soybean oilcake as protein source was mixed with a diet using either <b>sweet</b> <b>lupins</b> or canola oilcake or full-fat canola in ratios of 100 %, 67 % and 33 % respectively. In the broiler trial the test diets were fed {{for a period of}} six weeks with or without the enzyme Vegpro (Alltech). Pigs were fed the test diets, with and without Roxazyme® enzyme, ad libitum from 8. 5 to 25 kg live weight. The fatty acid content of the fat pads of the broilers raised on the different diets was determined. The pigs were kept in the trial up to the grower- finisher phase. The fatty acid content of the carcass fat and muscle of pigs raised on the different diets was determined. The inclusion of enzymes had no effect on the growth, feed intake or feed conversion ratio of broilers fed the test diets. The provision of external dietary enzymes to the weaner pig diets failed to improve either dry matter intake or growth rate, but improved the feed conversion ratio. Broiler weights at six weeks of age were significantly higher for the control diet compared to the 20 % lupin diet. There {{was no significant difference in}} the feed intake as the lupin content of the diets increased. The feed conversion ratio did not differ significantly between the control diet and the 6. 6 % lupin diet but became significantly poorer as the lupin content increased to 13. 2 % and 20 % of the test diet. There were no significant differences in production performance of the control diet and the canola oilcake containing diet. The broiler weights at six weeks decreased significantly with each increase in the canola oilcake content of the diets. The feed intake of the 20 % canola oilcake diet at week six was significantly less than the intake of the control diet, but not significantly less than the 6. 6 % and 13. 2 % canola oilcake diets. The feed conversion ratio of the control diet was significantly better than the 13. 2 % and 20 % canola oilcake diets. No significant differences were found in week six between the 6. 6 % full-fat canola diet and the control diet for broiler weights and feed intake. The feed conversion ratio of the broilers fed the 13. 2 % and 20 % full-fat canola diets was significantly poorer than the control diet. The final body weights of the weaner piglets fed the control diet were significantly higher than the final body weights of weaner piglets fed the lupin containing diets. The average daily gain of the weaner piglets fed the control diet was significantly higher than the gain of the weaner piglets fed the lupin containing diets. No significant differences in the feed intake and feed conversion ratio between the different lupin inclusion levels were detected. There were no significant differences in body weight, feed intake, average daily gain and the feed conversion ratio, between the various full-fat canola containing diets and the control diet. A significant difference in body weight was found between the weaner piglets fed the 20 % canola oilcake diet and the weaner piglets fed the control diet. There were no significant differences in feed intake between the various inclusion levels of canola oilcake. The control and 6. 6 % canola oilcake containing diets had significantly higher average daily gains than the 20 % canola oilcake containing diet. In the final trial the finisher pigs fed the test diet containing 25. 00 % lupins, had a final body weight significantly lighter than the final body weight of the finisher pigs fed the other test diets. The finisher pigs fed the test diet containing 25. 00 % lupins, also had a significantly reduced average daily gain and feed intake. The feed intake of the 25. 00 % canola oilcake diet was significantly lees than the feed intake of the 16. 75 % full-fat canola containing diet. The feed conversion ratio of the 25. 00 % lupin containing diet was significantly poorer than the feed conversion ratio of the 16. 75 % lupin containing diet, 8. 25 % lupin containing diet, 16. 75 % full-fat canola containing diet, 25. 00 % canola oilcake containing diet and the control diet. In a choice feeding trial growing pigs were offered four diets with four different protein sources: <b>sweet</b> <b>lupins</b> (25 % inclusion level), canola oilcake (25 % inclusion level), full-fat canola (25 % inclusion level) and soybean oilcake (25 % inclusion level), while their daily intakes were recorded. In a second choice feeding trial pigs were offered ten different diets with increasing levels (6. 6 %, 13. 2 %, 20 %) of either <b>sweet</b> <b>lupins,</b> canola oilcake meal or full-fat canola meal. The pigs consumed significantly more of the soybean oilcake containing diet compared to diets containing the alternative protein sources. Pigs consumed significantly less of the full-fat canola diet compared to the sweet lupin and canola oilcake diets. Ten different canola cultivars were collected from two different locations in the Mediterranean rainfall area of South Africa namely the Western Cape (Swartland) and Southern Cape (Rûens) grain producing areas. The sinapine and glucosinolate content of various canola cultivars was compared and the influence of locality on the sinapine and glucosinolate content of the canola cultivars was determined. There were no significant differences (P < 0. 05) in sinapine content when the canola produced in the Western and Southern Cape were compared. Varola 54 and Rainbow cultivars had significantly higher (P < 0. 05) sinapine contents compared to the Varola 50 cultivar. Samples of lupins, field peas, faba beans and narbon beans were collected and analysed for amino acids, alkaloids, non-starch polysaccharides, tannin and starch. The digestible energy value of these alternative protein sources for pigs was determined. Significant differences were found in the amino acid content of the various crops. The alkaloid content of the lupins varied significantly between the sweet and bitter lupin varieties. Sweet L. angustifolius cultivars contained ca 50 mg/kg and the bitter L. angustifolius cultivars ca 15000 mg/kg alkaloids. The mean alkaloid content of L. albus cultivars was ca 1300 mg/kg. The faba beans, narbon beans and peas had significantly higher values for tannins and starch, compared to lupins...|$|E

40|$|Lupin {{seeds are}} a source of good quality protein {{supplements}} for monogastric animals such as poultry and pigs, however, their use has been limited due to the presence of quinolizidine alkaloids mainly lupanine (Halvorson et al., 1983). Lupanine and other alkaloids affect the human and animal central nervous system causing symptoms such as depression, labored breathing, convulsions and death from respiratory failure (Keeler, 1989; Hill and Patuszewska, 1993). Plant breeders have worked on improving lupin by selecting varieties high in protein and low in alkaloids. Poultry can tolerate 15 - 25 % dietary low alkaloid lupin meal with no adverse effects; at higher levels, feed intake and growth rate are impaired (Karunajeewa and Bartlett, 1985; Ferraz de Oliveira, 1998). Positive production responses from the addition of supplementary enzymes to poultry diets containing whole and dehulled <b>sweet</b> <b>lupin</b> seed...|$|R
40|$|Oat stubble was grazed {{continuously}} {{during the}} summer and autumn (December-April) for 154 days by reproducing ewes (n = 48) and rumen fistulated wethers (n = 12) at a stocking rate of 2. 4 sheep ha- 1. The stubble was supplemented with 0, 200, 400 and 600 g <b>sweet</b> <b>lupin</b> seed per sheep day- 1 during the last 6 weeks of pregnancy and the first 5 - 6 weeks of lactation. An average of 1787 kg DM ha- 1 with a mean CP content of 71 g kg- 1 and DOM content of 501 g kg- 1 was available during the experimental period. A deficiency in CP content of the pasture was indicated by low rumen ammonia-N levels of wethers (3. 7 - 3. 9 mg per 100 ml), which progressively increased (P < 0. 05) by 3. 2 mg per 100 ml (SEb = 0. 6; R 2 = 0. 94) for each 100 g of supplement provided (OM basis). Organic matter intake of ewes from pasture per se during late pregnancy (1063 ± 86 g per ewe day- 1) and during lactation (1015 ± 150 g per ewe day- 1) declined (P < 0. 05) by 42 g day- 1 for each 100 g of supplement provided on an OM basis. <b>Sweet</b> <b>lupin</b> supplementation at 400 g day- 1 fulfilled requirements for DOM and CP during late pregnancy. During lactation a deficiency in DOM and CP still occurred at a supplementation level of 600 g day- 1. The BW loss of ewes during the first 6 weeks of lactation was reduced (P < 0. 05) by 2. 0 % (SEb = 0. 5; R 2 = 0. 91) for each 100 g increase in supplementary feed per day provided on an OM basis. No significant differences between supplementary groups were observed in terms of lamb birth weight, the lamb growth rate up to 42 days of age or in ewe wool growth rate. This was probably due to the high degradability of lupin seed. © 1997 Elsevier Science B. V. Articl...|$|R
40|$|The {{protein quality}} and physico-functional {{properties}} of Australian <b>sweet</b> <b>lupin</b> protein concentrates, prepared by isoelectric precipitation or ultrafiltration, were assessed. The ultrafiltration process {{resulted in a}} higher yield of protein than did the isoelectric precipitation process. The lupin kernel and the two lupin protein concentrates had similar essential amino acid compositions that were inferior to ideal human requirements. True digestibilities of the isoelectrically precipitated (ISO) and the ultrafiltered (UF) lupin protein concentrates were similar but significantly higher (P< 0. 05) than that of casein. Net protein utilisations (NPU) of the ISO and UF protein concentrates were similar but significantly lower (P< 0. 05) than that of casein. The UF protein concentrate had higher protein solubility than did the ISO protein concentrate (P< 0. 05). Low foaming capacity, low viscosity, but high emulsification capacity (particularly at low pH) were observed for lupin protein concentrates. <br /...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the use of different protein sources (soybean, faba bean, <b>sweet</b> <b>lupin</b> and pea) in lamb feed and their influence on the chemical and physical characteristics of the meat and on the acid composition of intramuscular fat. The meat of lambs fed on faba bean contained {{a greater percentage of}} fat than those fed on lupin (P < 0. 05) and soybean (P < 0. 01). The meat of lambs fed on faba bean had a greater (P < 0. 01) proportion of PUFA and a higher PUFA/SFA ratio than the meat of all other groups. The thrombogenicity index and nutritive value of meat fat were higher for lambs fed with faba bean and pea. The use of lupin in feed determined the highest (P < 0. 01) SFA percentage, the lowest PUFA incidence and the worst thrombogenicity index. In conclusion, the protein sources studied did not influence the physical characteristics of the meat. However, the acid composition improved with the use of pea, and especially of faba bean...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{principles}} of organic husbandry is that animal feed must be GMO free, and soya bean is well-known as a high risk GMO alimentary source. About 25 dry dairy cattle of the Italian Holstein breed, from the Cooperativa Emilio Sereni of Borgo S. Lorenzo (FI), were fed in two successive diets: the first with extruded soya bean (A), and the second in which bitter lupin, faba bean and proteinic pea substituted the soya bean (B). We evaluated both the consumption and the apparent digestibility (using acid insoluble ash as internal marker) of the two diets, repeating the trial twice. The presence of bitter lupin did not influence either the consumption of other feed, or the faecal water content. The apparent digestibility of the organic matter resulted satisfactory in both the diets, but was significantly higher in diet (A) than in diet (B) (71, 6 % vs 67, 3 %). In conclusion, even though we wish the cultivation of <b>sweet</b> <b>lupin</b> would be increase in Italy, we retain that also bitter lupin (mixed with other feed to increase the palatability) {{could be used as}} alternative protein source in dairy cattle diets...|$|R

40|$|Australian <b>Sweet</b> <b>Lupin</b> (ASL) has a {{nutritional}} profile ideally suited {{for human consumption}} with high protein and fibre, but low starch and fat content. The nutritional and protein profile of germinated ASL may be better than ungerminated ASL and these improvements would provide further benefits in its use as an ingredient in food applications. In this study the nutritional components such as protein, crude fibre, fat and protein profile of germinated ASL flour following germination at 25 ℃ and 90 % - 95 % relative humidity for 9 days were determined. The changes {{in the pattern of}} ASL protein during germination were analysed using sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Germination significantly increased crude fibre contents by 450 % (db), total protein contents by 38 % (db) and decreased the fat content by 70 % (db) at day 9 of germination. Electrophoretic analysis of the protein fractions revealed that during germination up to 9 days, some of the high molecular weight proteins disappeared. Germination represents a means to further improve the nutritional profile of the germinated ASL flour with an increased fibre and protein, but lower fat content...|$|R
