40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{extensive}} background {{study on the}} use of bio-oil modified binder, used in surface dressings in Iceland, was carried out. Surface dressings, or chip seals, are paved by first spraying out binder and then distributing aggregates over the surface before compaction. The bio-oil, most notably fish oil ethyl ester or rape seed oil, is included in a binder mixture to lower its viscosity, enabling the binder to be sprayed out at a lower temperature than unmodified bitumen. In January 2013, severe bleeding of binder was noticed on road sections paved with bio-oil modified surface dressings {{in the northern part of}} Iceland. Following the bleeding, the Icelandic Road and Coastal Administration (IRCA) sent samples of the sections in question, as well as binder samples, for testing at the laboratory of Highway and Railway Engineering at KTH Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden. The conclusions of that study were that the fish oil ethyl ester was highly polar and had solubility issues with the bitumen. This was found to have led to the fish oil separating from the binder mixture and covering the stones, preventing bonding between aggregates and binder [1]. The laboratory tests in this thesis extend on the aforementioned research. Through the background investigation it was found thatWetfix N, an adhesion promoter, was used in the binder mixture to facilitate bonding to the aggregates. Based on these findings, previous work and field experience in Iceland, two sample sets were created. The first sample set included 7. 5 % of either fish oil ethyl ester or rape seed oil by weight, while the second set included 4 % of the same bio-oils by weight. To determine the effect of the adhesion promoter, all samples were tested with and without Wetfix N. Furthermore, all samples were put through a short-term aging treatment to simulate the process during mixing and paving, and tested again. The findings of this study suggest that the fish oil ethyl ester is more suitable for road constructions, compared to the rape seed oil, and that adhesion promoter should always be included when paving surface dressings in Iceland. Furthermore, the samples tested cannot be recommended for field use due to high polarity in the sample with a fish oil concentration of 7. 5 % and too high viscosity in the sample which includes 4 % of fish oil. Therefore, it can be said that the upper and lower limits have been narrowed to the range between the two concentrations tested. To better understand the properties and behavior of the sample mixtures, a complete adhesion test with aggregates is advisable. Viscosity testing of samples which include between 4. 5 % and 7 % of fish oil by weight are recommended and the mixture with the lowest concentration that passes IRCA’s guidelines for <b>spraying</b> <b>viscosity</b> at a desired temperature should be used in practice...|$|R

Fuel viscosity markedly influences injection, <b>spraying</b> and combustion, <b>viscosity</b> is thus critical factor {{to be evaluated}} and monitored. This work is focused on quantifying the differences in temperature dependent kinematic viscosity regular diesel fuel and B 30 biodiesel fuel. The samples were assumed to be Newtonian fluids.

More significant difference between minimum and maximum values was found in case of diesel fuel in comparison with biodiesel fuel. Temperature dependence of both fuels was modeled using several mathematical models – polynomial, power and Gaussian equation. The Gaussian fit offers the best match between experimental and computed data. Description of viscosity behavior of fuels is critically important, e. g. when considering or calculating running efficiency and performance of combustion engines.

5000|$|The {{spray angle}} diverges or converges {{with respect to}} the {{vertical}} axis. As illustrated in the figure below, the spray angle tends to collapse or diverge with increasing distance from the orifice. Spray coverage varies with spray angle. The theoretical coverage, C, of spray patterns at various distances may be calculated with the equation below for spray angles less than 180 degrees. The spray angle is assumed to remain constant throughout the entire spray distance. Liquids more viscous than water form smaller spray angles, or solid streams, depending upon nozzle capacity, <b>spray</b> pressure, and <b>viscosity.</b> Liquids with surface tensions lower than water produce wider spray angles than those listed for water. Spray angles are typically measured using optical or mechanical methods. The optical methods include shadowgraphy, extinction tomography, and Mie Imaging. [...] Sprays angles are important in coating applications to prevent overspraying of the coated materials, in combustion engines to prevent wetting of the cylinder walls, and in fire sprinklers to provide adequate coverage of the protected property.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to investigate the effects of fuel properties on the spray characteristics of a common-rail type marine diesel injector. Spray characteristics are highly influential in determining engine performance and emission characteristics in direct-injection engine systems containing marine diesel engines. Thus, the relationship between the physical properties of HFO fuel and its spray characteristics is investigated via an analysis of HFO and spray experiments. Data from physical property measurements (e. g., fuel density, dynamic viscosity, and surface tension) are used to derive empirical equations between fuel temperatures and physical properties, and the results follow the common tendencies of temperature-property curves for general liquid substances. In spray experiments, injection quantity measurements, injection rate profiles, and spray visualization were conducted under various injection pressures, energizing durations, and ambient pressures. The test temperatures of HFO were set from the results of physical property measurements. Experimental data reveal that spray characteristics are affected by fuel properties in terms of injection delays, injection profiles, and spray development speed. The injection quantity increased proportionally with fuel densities and the onset of injection was delayed with increased dynamic <b>viscosity.</b> <b>Spray</b> tip penetration decreased with increased fuel temperature.

40|$|This work {{examines}} {{the investigation of}} the spray drying process of Hydroxyapatite powder (HA) used as a thermal spray deposit in the application of orthopaedic femoral implants. In this research, the Niro- Minor™ mixed spray dryer was used for both modelling and experimental studies. The process parameters investigated included HA slurry viscosity, temperature, and air flowrate. Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) modelling and validation of the spray drying of HA powder was performed. An analysis of the spray drying of the HA slurry, was performed using the UMETRI AB, MODDE 7 software. For the CFD analysis, the Spray dryer was divided into the three parts; two-fluid nozzle, the drying chamber, and atomisation. The Standard K-e, Reliable K-e and Reynolds Stress Model models were used to predict velocity profiles of the air, feed pipe of the two external nozzle and temperature profile for the drying chamber. Different model results were compared, studied and compared with experimental results. The standard K-e method is found to have good agreement with the experiment data in predicting the air and feed nozzle velocities, and the Reliable K-e simulated the temperature profile of the drying chamber. These results were also used to predict atomisation modelling. The models hence have proved to be an innovative method of understanding the dynamics of the spray drying technique. In the statistical analysis of the spray drying process, factors such as temperature and flowrate of the inlet hot air in the <b>spray</b> dryer, <b>viscosity</b> of feed/ HA and responses (chamber powder size, cyclone powder size, deposition of powder on the wall of spray dryer and overall thermal efficiency) were determined using a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) method and the statistical analysis of main and interaction effects were quantified using the ANOVA test. For the chamber particle size, the statistical analysis showed that the viscosity of the HA slurry is most significant and for the cyclone particle size, the main affects are temperature, viscosity and flow rate, and also the interaction effect of temperature and viscosity were significant. Wall deposition is influenced by temperature and the interaction of both temperature and <b>viscosity.</b> The <b>spray</b> dried HA powders were also studied in terms of morphology. The two main shapes observed are a doughnut and solid sphere shape {{as a result of the}} different input parameters. A solid sphere of HA spray dried powder with pores was observed when a viscosity of 75 mPa. s was applied to all three levels of drying temperature. Doughnut shaped particles were observed when a slurry viscosity of 50 mPa. s was utilised. This doughnut phenomenon was more pronounced with an increase in the spray drying air temperature (461 K) in the chamber powders. While a viscosity of 50 mPa. s and temperature of 461 K yielded the ideal particle size and range, in terms of HA morphology, where a mix of solid and doughnut shape powder was produced. This is beneficial for HA thermal spray coatings as they require porous coatings to help the growth of the cells inside the coating to provide a strong bioactive bond between the implant and bone. This research provides a deeper understanding into the spray drying of hydroxyapatite powders providing data to improve its application in the use of HA deposits to anatomically join femoral implants to human tissue...|$|R
40|$|The present work is {{concerned}} with the characterization of liquid spray impact onto walls and films. Empirical studies on spray impact rely almost solely on the phase Doppler instrument for obtaining quantitative data about drop size and velocity distributions. The thesis begins therefore with a careful examination of applying the phase Doppler instrument to new-wall measurements beneath a spray. This includes consideration of the influence of the measurement volume height above the rigid wall, the input laser power and the spatial location of the detection volume on the measured characteristics of the impinging and secondary spray. This knowledge is then used for all subsequent measurements made within the framework of this investigation. After a qualitative and quantitative characterization of the resulting secondary spray and the accumulated wall film, a set of empirical models is presented for prediction of the characteristics of the secondary spray generated due to a liquid spray impact onto a rigid wall. In the models, characterization of the secondary spray has been formulated in terms of correlations for the velocity and trajectory of secondary droplets and the mass and number ratio of the secondary spray. The novel aspect of the model is that the correlations are based on the mean statistics over many events in the spray and not on the outcome of single drop impact experiments. Another interesting feature of the experiments is the rather large range of oblique impact angles captured, due to the different drop trajectories exiting from the spray. A phase Doppler instrument has been used to measure drop size and two components of velocity directly above the target. A high-speed CCD camera has been used to measure the average film thickness formed due to spray impact. In a second step, a theoretical model to predict the average film thickness formed due to a liquid spray impinging onto a flat and rigid wall is presented. This model takes into account the characteristics of the impinging spray, e. g. flux density of impacting droplets, hydrodynamic pressure of the impinging <b>spray</b> and <b>viscosity</b> of the impacting liquid droplets. It considers the mass and momentum balance of the film, including viscosity effect and neglecting the Laplace pressure. A second simplified model for predicting the average film thickness as a function of mean Reynolds number and flux density of the impacting droplets and the average drop diameter is presented based on dimensional analysis. Both theoretical derivations for the average film thickness show good agreement with most of the measurements. This thesis also provides an experimental comparison of the splashing phenomenon for single drops and for drops in a spray, followed by a derived theoretical model. Such a comparison can be very valuable for future modelling of spray impact. The last section of this thesis presents an experimental study for different aspects of liquid spray impact onto a deep liquid layer under well controlled experimental conditions; deformation of the air-liquid film interface due to the hydrodynamic pressure exerted by the impacting drops, the generation of a secondary spray, and the air bubble entrainment into the liquid film. A high-speed CCD camera has been used to measure the deformation of the air-liquid film interface and the distribution of the air bubbles inside the deep liquid film. Two different configurations of a phase Doppler instrument have been used to measure drop size and two components of velocity directly above the film as well as the size and two components of velocity of the air bubbles inside the deep pool...|$|R
