5|$|Upon {{graduation}} Paton joined Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners, {{which had}} been founded in 1922. One of his first jobs there was {{to assist with the}} design of a new jetty for Barking Power Station. In 1927 he worked on a dam at Maentwrog in North Wales and between 1932 and 1933 was resident engineer on the Glenlee portion of the Galloway hydro-electric power scheme. Paton was seconded to the Rangoon Port Trust in 1930 to construct a wharf for the export of Lead from Burma. This wharf survived a serious earthquake on 5 May 1930 and was opened on 20 February 1931. On 10 April 1931 Paton sailed to Canada to undertake a survey of its ports and outline the additional facilities that would be required in the next 25–50 years. He was assisted in this for six weeks by Ralph Freeman who had designed the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The report was issued on 15 January 1932 but was not implemented until 1935 with the election of William Lyon Mackenzie King as Prime Minister of Canada. The report's findings continued to be in use until the 1970s. Paton was responsible {{for the construction of a}} new brewery for Guinness in Park Royal, London from October 1933 to October 1936. This was the biggest job of his career thus far and involved the construction of seven steel framed buildings, a power station, a <b>storage</b> <b>silo,</b> roads and railway sidings. Paton also built industrial and trading estates in Wales, West Cumberland and London. He was made a partner in the firm in 1938.|$|E
25|$|The Harbach Round Barn is {{an example}} of a {{noteworthy}} design variation within round barn design, specifically because of its specially braced roof. It is not entirely unique; its cupola and roof make it very similar to the Fehr Round Barn. The main difference in the Fehr and Harbach Round Barns is the Harbach's lack of a central <b>storage</b> <b>silo.</b> The building was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on February 23, 1984 as part of a Multiple Property Submission.|$|E
500|$|When the Smallville {{crew was}} not filming {{on one of}} the {{constructed}} sets, or on a sound stage, they were shooting on location at the surrounding Vancouver sites. During the filming of [...] "Metamorphosis", Vancouver was holding a farmers' market, which proved beneficial to the Smallville crew, as [...] "Metamorphosis" [...] called for a similar event to take place in the episode. The market {{was on the verge of}} ending, so the filmmakers shot what wide-angle scenes they could at the time, and filmed a close up conversation between Whitney and Clark at the Andalini's farm, weeks after the initial market shooting. Other filming locations include Vancouver's Pacific National Exhibition and Burnaby's Swangard Stadium. The Pacific National Exhibit provided a <b>storage</b> <b>silo</b> for a scene in [...] "Hourglass", which involved Harry Bollston (Eric Christian Olsen) attacking Martha Kent (O'Toole) in the Kents' corn silo. [...] "Hothead" [...] director Greg Beeman, who had previously worked with Gough and Millar on The Strip and Martial Law, used Swangard Stadium, as a substitution for Smallville High Stadium, for the opening football scene that took place at night.|$|E

50|$|Henninger Turm (Henninger Tower) was a grain <b>storage</b> <b>silo</b> {{located in}} the Sachsenhausen-Süd {{district}} of Frankfurt, Germany. It was built by Henninger Brewery (now part of the Binding Brewery/Radeberger Group) and had a storage capacity of 16,000 tons of barley. The 120 m, 33-storey, reinforced concrete tower was designed by Karl Lieser and was built from 1959 to 1961. It was inaugurated on 18 May 1961. It was demolished in 2013. Until 1974 it was the tallest building in Frankfurt; and it remained the tallest <b>storage</b> <b>silo</b> in the world until its demolition.|$|E

50|$|Silo {{cleaning}} is {{a process}} to maximize the efficiency of <b>storage</b> <b>silos</b> that hold bulk powders or granules.

50|$|A forage {{harvester}} (also {{known as a}} silage harvester, forager or chopper) is a farm implement that harvests forage plants to make silage. Silage is grass, corn or other plant that has been chopped into small pieces, and compacted together in a <b>storage</b> <b>silo,</b> silage bunker, or in silage bags. The silage is then fermented to provide feed for livestock. Haylage is a similar process to silage but using grass which has dried.|$|E
50|$|Heygates Mill is a flour mill. Originally {{it was a}} {{windmill}}, and {{the company}} was run by William Mead. The windmill was demolished in 1910 {{to make way for}} a wheat <b>storage</b> <b>silo.</b> In those days, Mead lived on site, in a house next to the yard, and owned half the area taken by the mill of today. The remaining space was occupied by boat-builders, Bushell Brothers, who built narrowboats for the canal.|$|E
