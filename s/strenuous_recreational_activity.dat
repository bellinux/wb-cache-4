40|$|In North America {{and most}} Western European countries, {{testicular}} cancer {{is often cited}} as the most common cancer among young and middle-aged men, and yet {{few studies have examined}} the relation between modifiable factors and testicular cancer risk. Data collected between 1995 and 1996 in Ontario, Canada, as part of the Enhanced Cancer Surveillance Study were used to examine the relation between the frequency of recreational, and intensity of occupational, physical activity at various life periods, including cumulative and averaged lifetime activity and risk of testicular cancer. Analysis of 212 cases and 251 controls revealed that relatively high frequency of participation in moderate and <b>strenuous</b> <b>recreational</b> <b>activity</b> in the midteens may have an adverse effect on risk of testicular cancer (odds ratio = 2. 36, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 20, 4. 64 for moderate activity of greater than five times a week compared with three times or less a month and odds ratio = 2. 58, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 14, 5. 85 for strenuous activity of greater than five times a week compared with less than once a month). Moderate or strenuous occupational demands in one's 20 s also increased risk of disease.

40|$|Aims  In a large {{ethnically diverse}} {{nationwide}} sample of post-menopausal women we explored {{the relationship between}} fasting insulin levels, ethnicity, and {{a wide range of}} anthropometric, socio-economic, and lifestyle factors. Methods  Subjects were post-menopausal women aged 50 – 79  years without diagnosed diabetes mellitus comprising a subsample (n  =  3500) of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Clinical Trial and Observational Study. In a cross-sectional survey at baseline, we analysed the association between ethnicity and fasting insulin using analysis of covariance procedures and identified independent correlates of hyperinsulinaemia, defined by the 75 th percentile cut point for each ethnic group. Results  Fasting insulin levels were higher among African-American and Hispanic women than among non-Hispanic White or Asian women. These differences persisted after adjustment for age, educational attainment, total and central body obesity, adult weight change, family history of diabetes, smoking status, alcohol consumption, use of menopausal hormone therapy and physical activity. Higher levels of body mass index, waist–hip ratio, adult weight gain, and lower levels of total and moderate or <b>strenuous</b> <b>recreational</b> <b>activity</b> were independent correlates of fasting hyperinsulinaemia. Habitual walking was also inversely associated with fasting insulin. Conclusions  In this cross-sectional analysis, fasting insulin levels were higher among African-American and Hispanic post-menopausal women as compared with non-Hispanic White and Asian women. In addition, obesity, adult weight gain, and low levels of moderate or strenuous physical activity were independently associated with hyperinsulinaemia. Diabet. Med. 23, 77 – 85 (2006...|$|E
40|$|Background: Physical {{activity}} {{may be associated}} with decreasing endometrial cancer risk; it remains unclear whether the association is modified by body size. Methods: Among 93 888 eligible California Teachers Study participants, 976 were diagnosed with incident endometrial cancer between 1995 – 1996 and 2007. Cox proportional hazards regression methods were used to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for endometrial cancer associated with long-term (high school through age 54 years) and baseline (3 years prior to joining the cohort) <b>strenuous</b> and moderate <b>recreational</b> physical <b>activity,</b> overall and by body size. Results: Increased baseline <b>strenuous</b> <b>recreational</b> physical <b>activity</b> was associated with decreased endometrial cancer risk (Ptrend 0. 006) with approximately 25 % lower risk among women exercising 43 h per week per year than among those exercising o 1 / 2 h per week per year (RR, 0. 76; 95 % CI, 0. 63 – 0. 92). This inverse association was observed among overweight/obese women (body mass index Z 25 kgm 2; Ptrend 0. 006), but not among thinner women (Ptrend 0. 12). Baseline moderate activity was associated with lower risk among overweight/obese women. Conclusion: Increasing physical activity, particularly strenuous activity, may be a lifestyle change that overweight and obese women can implement to reduce their endometrial cancer risk.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Some {{studies of}} white women suggest that {{exercise}} reduces {{the incidence of}} breast cancer. There are no data on black women. We assessed the relationship between strenuous physical activity and prevalent breast cancer among participants in the Black Women's Health Study. METHODS: Data on <b>strenuous</b> <b>recreational</b> physical <b>activity</b> at various ages and other factors were collected in 1995 by mail questionnaire from 64, 524 United States black women aged 21 to 69 years. The 704 women who reported breast cancer (cases) were matched on age and on menopausal status {{at the time of}} the breast cancer diagnosis with 1408 women who did not report breast cancer (controls). Odds ratios for levels of physical activity at various ages were derived from conditional logistic regression with control for potential confounding factors. RESULTS: Odds ratios for > or = 7 h per week relative to < 1 were significantly reduced for strenuous activity at age 21 for breast cancer overall and premenopausal breast cancer, at age 30 for breast cancer overall, and at age 40 for postmenopausal breast cancer. There was no evidence of a reduction associated with exercise in high school. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study suggest that strenuous physical activity in early adulthood is associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer in African-American women...|$|R
30|$|Upper {{extremity}} DVT may {{be classified}} into {{primary and secondary}} subtypes based on the pathogenesis [3, 8]. Primary UEDVT, Paget-Schrötter syndrome, was first described independently by Sir James Paget and Leopold von Schrötter {{in the nineteenth century}} [9 – 11]. Often called 'effort' thrombosis, it is a UEDVT occurring spontaneously after <b>strenuous</b> occupational or <b>recreational</b> <b>activity,</b> such as scraping wallpaper, throwing a baseball, or weightlifting [8, 11, 12]. This heavy exertion is thought to cause microtrauma to the vessel intima because of repeated mechanical compression from the clavicle, first rib, and enlarged shoulder muscles [3, 11]. It occurs most commonly in young, healthy men and is more commonly found in the right arm, likely because this is usually dominant and involved in more strenuous activity [10]. This syndrome is uncommon, but it should be considered by emergency physicians when presented with arm pain and swelling in an otherwise healthy adult and is particularly relevant for physicians focusing on sports or occupational medicine.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine {{relationships}} between personality traits (conscientiousness, extraversion, and neuroticism), self-determination, self-efficacy for exercise and perceived health to the stages of exercise behavior change (SEBC) and to identify relationships between personality traits (conscientiousness, extraversion, and neuroticism) and self-determination (amotivation, external, introjected, identified, and intrinsic regulation) among regular exercisers. Subjects were a convenience sample of 188 older adults (mean age = 71. 1, SD = 8. 5) living in a Midwestern community. Questionnaires included the NEO-Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), the Behavioral Regulation for Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ- 2), the Stages of Exercise Behavior Change (SEBC), the five item Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (SEQ), 12 -Item Short Form Health Survey Instrument (SF- 12), and Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE). Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, ordinal logistic regression utilizing Proc CATMOD 2 ̆ 6 Proc GENMOD and one-way ANOVA. Results showed that education was correlated with SEBC. Proc CATMOD showed that of 10 predictor variables, conscientiousness, overall self-determination, self-efficacy for exercise, perceived mental health and perceived physical health were positively associated with SEBC. Proc GENMOD identified that intrinsic regulation and self-efficacy for exercise distinguished the precontemplation stage; conscientiousness and introjected regulation distinguished the preparation stage; introjected regulation and perceived physical health status distinguished the action stage; and conscientiousness, introjected regulation, intrinsic regulation, perceived mental health status and self-efficacy for exercise distinguished the maintenance stage. Among those in the maintenance stage (n= 128) extraversion was positively correlated with intrinsic regulation and conscientiousness was positively correlated with identified regulation and intrinsic regulation. In addition, overall PASE scores were significantly different across SEBC. Older adults in the maintenance stage were more engaged in <b>strenuous</b> sport, <b>recreational</b> <b>activities,</b> muscle strength and endurance activities than those in the precontemplation, contemplation, and preparation stages. These findings should be considered in the process of developing effective stage-based intervention strategies among older adults in order to increase the probability of moving from a lower to a higher stage and then maintaining the stage shift. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{investigate}} how much self-determination persons with intellectual disabilities living in group-homes have when it comes to <b>recreational</b> <b>activities.</b> We studied what the <b>recreational</b> <b>activities</b> looked like, if there was any self-determination concerning <b>recreational</b> <b>activities</b> and which factors influenced self-determination for persons with intellectual disabilities. We used qualitative interviews with persons with intellectual disabilities, next of kin and personnel at group-homes.

40|$|Once {{non-indigenous}} {{species are}} introduced to a new area, secondary spread is important in determining their ecological and economic impacts. <b>Recreational</b> <b>activities</b> may facilitate the secondary spread of invasive species by creating and transporting viable propagules, however to date there are few manipulative experiments that demonstrate the mechanistic basis of their impact. We examined the effect {{of two of the}} main aquatic <b>recreational</b> <b>activities,</b> boating and swimming, on the abundance of propagules (fragments) of the invasive green alga, Caulerpa taxifolia in southeastern Australia. Surveys of two infested estuaries each with locations of different levels of <b>recreational</b> <b>activity</b> demonstrated that locations with high <b>recreational</b> <b>activity</b> had a significantly greater abundance and biomass of fragments than locations with low <b>recreational</b> <b>activity.</b> Manipulative experiments using beyond BACI type designs showed that both boating and swimming created fragments. A single pass of a motor-boat over C taxifolia beds significantly increased the biomass of fragments. but only in shallow water. Similarly, swimming in C. taxifolia beds for 5 min significantly increased the biomass of fragments, but only when background levels of fragments were low. This study has provided the first manipulative experiments confirming that <b>recreational</b> <b>activities</b> such as boating and swimming can create propagules of aquatic invasive species. These findings provide scientific justification for targeting management efforts to minimize secondary spread of aquatic invasive species by restricting <b>recreational</b> <b>activities</b> in invaded areas...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if having the ability to swim effects one's overall quality of life and water recreational participation. Subjects were 46 residents from TODCO senior housing that ranged in age from 65 to 93 years old. The mean age was 72. 3 years old. Their overall quality of life was measured using Ferrans' and Powers' Quality of Life Index. Participants were also asked about swimming ability and what water <b>recreational</b> <b>activities</b> they have participated in the past and what water <b>recreational</b> <b>activities</b> they were currently participating in. The results indicated that the ability to swim did not effect one's quality of life. There was a significant difference between the number of water <b>recreational</b> <b>activities</b> that swimmers participated in compared to those participated in by non-swimmers. Swimmers reported that they participated in more water <b>recreational</b> <b>activities</b> than non-swimmers.
