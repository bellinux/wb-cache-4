5|$|Because of {{regulations}} {{imposed by the}} Writers Guild of America, only those employed as writers for <b>Saturday</b> <b>Night</b> Live were allowed to write sketches for the program. Henson and his puppeteers merely performed the scripts for the segments—they {{were not involved in}} the writing process. <b>Saturday</b> <b>Night</b> Live cast members did not enjoy working with The Land of Gorch segments. Writing assignments for The Land of Gorch sketches were given to <b>Saturday</b> <b>Night</b> Live staff as a penalty for being the least-liked among the production team. Writers generally regarded the routines as childish.|$|E
5|$|Frank Oz said The Land of Gorch {{experiment}} had its positives and negatives. Oz said {{he thought}} the routine was not a good fit for <b>Saturday</b> <b>Night</b> Live, and that the cartoon-style humor of their characters did not work well with the comedy of <b>Saturday</b> <b>Night</b> Live, much of which was initially derived from the Second City environment. Oz said he generally enjoyed working on <b>Saturday</b> <b>Night</b> Live and witnessing the skill of performers such as Andy Kaufman, Albert Brooks, John Belushi, Chevy Chase, and Dan Aykroyd.|$|E

5|$|In {{their book}} Saturday Night: A Backstage History of <b>Saturday</b> <b>Night</b> Live, authors Doug Hill and Jeff Weingrad {{wrote that the}} sketch was writer Michael O'Donoghue's {{signature}} success on the television program.

5|$|Bernie Brillstein, Henson's talent agent, {{helped him}} {{move away from}} working solely on {{productions}} for children. When Henson decided to engage Brillstein as his talent agent, Henson was not well known within the industry. Brillstein was an asset to Henson; his clients included Lorne Michaels and three <b>Saturday</b> <b>Night</b> Live cast members, Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd, and John Belushi. Henson wanted Muppets incorporated into <b>Saturday</b> <b>Night</b> Live {{as a way to}} expunge the popular view his characters were only for young audiences. With help from Frank Oz, Henson generated The Land of Gorch characters for use on <b>Saturday</b> <b>Night</b> Live. His new characters were featured in the television program's first season. Henson designed the conceptual framework of The Land of Gorch characters to be eccentric.|$|E
