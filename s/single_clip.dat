By the second pre-chorus, several passengers play ping pong, as Utada exercises. The second chorus has Utada dancing inside a party, whilst intercut scenes of different stop motion animations are seen. In the bridge section, it has a close-up of Utada {{in front of a}} forest-like backdrop again, and also has Utada sitting on a swing. The final chorus has the spacecraft falling onto the ground, and creates a vast field of flowers, trees, and grass. The final scene has the camera zooming out of the spacecraft next to a tree, riddled with vines and flowers. The music video and the behind the scenes video was included on her DVD compilation <b>Single</b> <b>Clip</b> Collection Vol. 3 (2000).|$|E

60|$|A thought flashed {{across my}} mind, and I clapped my hand {{into my pocket}} and jerked {{out a pair of}} scissors. In an instant I was free. The world and the stag was before me, and I was flying along with a tornado-like {{swiftness}} that soon brought me abreast of the deer. This perfectly splendid, bounding creature was not far away from me {{on the other side of}} the hedge, and as the field was higher than the road I could see him perfectly. His legs worked so regular and springy, except when he came to a cross hedge, which he went over with a <b>single</b> <b>clip,</b> and came down like India rubber on the other side, that one might have thought he was measuring the grass, and keeping an account of his jumps in his head.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} the design, construction, {{and operation of}} a low-cost, microprocessor-based digital correlator. The device has 128 channels, operates in either the <b>single</b> <b>clipping</b> or <b>single</b> scaling mode, and allows {{selection of the sample}} interval with 2 -digit precision over the range 100 ns to 9. 9 s. The device can be operated in the autocorrelate or cross-correlate mode and may easily be expanded to more than 128 correlation channels...|$|R
40|$|The moist {{tropical}} {{forests of the}} Western Ghats of India are pockmarked with savanna-grasslands created and managed by local agricultural communities. A sample of such savanna-grasslands with differing growing conditions was studied in terms of peak above-ground biomass, monthly growth, and cumulative production under different clipping treatments. The herblayer {{was found to be}} dominated by perennial C 4 grasses, with Eulalia trispicata, Arundinella metzii and Themeda triandra being common to all sites. Peak biomass ranged between 3. 3 - 5. 9 t/ha at sites most favourable for grass production. Across these sites, peak biomass was found to be inversely related to the number of rainy days during the growing season, suggesting that growth may be light-limited. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that growth is most rapid immediately after the easing of the monsoon. <b>Single</b> <b>clips</b> early in the growing season had no negative or a slightly positive effect on production, but mid-season <b>single</b> <b>clips</b> or continuous frequent clipping reduced production by as much as 40 %. The results suggest that, while indiscriminate grazing may certainly be deleterious, it is possible to obtain sustained high yields from forest lands managed for grass production without totally excluding grazing...|$|R

50|$|In 2001, Lego re-released the {{well-known}} Guarded Inn, re-numbered (#10000) as a Lego Legend. The set {{consisted of two}} Lion Knights, a mounted Black Falcon Knight, and an inn keeper. This set was the only structure to include red Tudor walls. One change in the reissue was the horse saddle had two clips instead of one. Since 1984, Lego Castle had horse saddles with a <b>single</b> <b>clip</b> (except the horse barding saddles) at one side until 1992 when that was changed to two clips.|$|E
50|$|Until 1938, all M91 {{rifles and}} {{carbines}} were chambered for the rimless 6.5×52mm Modello 1895 cartridge, using a round-nose metal case bullet of 160 grains weight at approximately 2,000-2,400 ft/s muzzle velocity, depending upon barrel length. At least one small arms authority noted inconsistencies in powder types in arsenal-loaded 6.5×52mm military ammunition, often with different powder types and ammunition lots intermixed within a <b>single</b> <b>clip</b> of ammunition. The practice of intermixing powder types and ammunition lots in clipped rifle ammunition was generally avoided by arsenals of other nations, as it generally resulted in varying bullet velocities and excessive bullet dispersion on the target.|$|E

50|$|Many {{critics of}} the MPAA system, {{especially}} independent distributors, have charged that major studios' releases often receive more lenient treatment than independent films. The independent film Saints and Soldiers, which contains no nudity, almost no sex (although, there is {{a scene in which}} a German soldier is about to rape a French woman), very little profanity, and a minimum of violence, was said to have been rated R for a <b>single</b> <b>clip</b> where a main character is shot and killed, and required modification of just that one scene to receive a PG-13 rating. Eric Watson, producer of the independently-distributed, NC-17-rated Requiem for a Dream complained that the studios are paying the budget of the MPAA, which gives the studios leverage over the MPAA's decisions.|$|E
