The distribution between the phases is calculated by either D-ratio functions or by a novel kinetic model for the transfer between the phases.

40|$|Applying spectroscopic {{tools for}} {{chemical}} processes has been intensively studied in various industries owing to its rapid and non-destructively analysis for detecting chemical components and physical characteristic {{in a process}} stream. The general complexity of separation processes for used nuclear fuel, e. g., chemical speciation, temperature variations, and prominent process security and safety concerns, require a well-secured monitoring system to provide precise information of the process streams at real time without interference. Multivariate analysis accompanied with spectral measurements is a powerful statistic tool {{that can be used}} to monitor this complex chemical system. In this thesis, chemometric models that respond to the chemical components in the samples were calibrated and validated to establish an inline near real time monitoring system. The models show good prediction accuracy using partial least square regression analysis on the spectral data obtained from NIR, Raman and UV/Vis spectroscopies. Ultimately, an extraction process using a single <b>stage</b> centrifugal <b>contactor</b> was tested in our laboratory to determine the performance of an inline near real time monitoring system for a solvent extraction process representative of used nuclear fuel separation processes...|$|R
40|$|TRUEX {{is being}} {{evaluated}} at Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP) for separating actinides from acidic radioactive waste stored at ICPP; efforts have {{culminated in a}} recent demonstration with actual tank waste. A continuous countercurrent flowsheet test was successfully completed at ICPP using waste from tank WM- 183. This demonstration was performed using 24 states of 2 -cm dia centrifugal contactors in the shielded hot cell at the ICPP Remote Analytical Laboratory. The flowsheet had 8 extraction stages, 5 scrub stages, 6 strip stages, 3 solvent wash stages, and 2 acid rinse <b>stages.</b> A centrifugal <b>contactor</b> <b>stage</b> in the scrub section was not working during testing, and the scrub feed (aqueous) solution followed the solvent into the strip section, eliminating the scrub section in the flowsheet. An overall removal efficiency of 99. 97 % was obtained for the actinides, reducing the activity from 457 nCi/g in the feed to 0. 12 nCi/g in the aqueous raffinate, well below the NRC Class A LLW requirement of 10 nCi/g for non-TRU waste. The 0. 04 M HEDPA strip section back-extracted 99. 9998 % of the actinide from the TRUEX solvent. Removal efficiencies of > 99. 90, 99. 96, 99. 98, > 98. 89, 93. 3, and 89 % were obtained for {sup 241 }Am, {sup 238 }Pu, {sup 239 }Pu, {sup 235 }U, {sup 238 }U, and {sup 99 }Tc. Fe was partially extracted by the TRUEX solvent, resulting in 23 % of the Fe exiting in the strip product. Hg was also extracted by the TRUEX solvent (73 %) and stripped from the solvent in the 0. 25 M Na 2 CO 3 wash section. Only 1. 4 % of the Hg exited with the high activity waste strip product...|$|R

40|$|Temperature profile {{testing was}} {{performed}} using a 30 stage 5 -cm centrifugal contactor pilot plant. These tests {{were performed to}} evaluate {{the ability to control}} process temperature by adjusting feed solution temperatures.

Thermocouples were installed on the inlet and outlets of each stage, as well as directly in the mixing zone of several of the <b>contactor</b> <b>stages.</b> Lamp oil, a commercially available alkane mixture of C 14 to C 18 chains, and tap water adjusted to pH 2 with nitric acid were the solution feeds for the temperature profile testing.

In this paper, an inverse problem {{in determining the}} value of input parameters for a desired value of output parameters of mass transfer process in the 23 <b>stages</b> Rotating Disc <b>Contactor</b> (RDC) column is considered. Hence, an inverse model describing the process in obtaining {{the solution of the}} problem is developed. The model involves only the process of mass tansfer of a single drop of size assumed to be smaller then the critical drop size, in multiple stages RDC column. This is an extension of the work done on the mass transfer process of a single drop in single stage RDC column. The algorithm is based on fuzzy approach and the assumptions made in mass transfer process as adopted in previous work are also being used. The presented algorithm yields results such that the norm between actual outputs obtained from the approximate solution and the target output is less than 10 %. The algorithm is also capable of determining the optimal values of the input parameters.

40|$|The {{literature}} on the potential use of liquid ammonia as a solvent for the extraction of aromatic hydrocarbons from mixtures with paraffins, {{and the application of}} reflux, has been reviewed. Reference is made to extractors suited to this application. A pilot scale extraction plant was designed comprising a Scm. diameter by 12 Scm. high, 50 <b>stage</b> Rotating Disc <b>Contactor</b> with 2 external settlers. Provision was made for operation with, or without, reflux at a pressure of 10 bar and ambient temperature. The solvent recovery unit consisted of an evaporator, compressor and condenser in a refrigeration cycle.

Equlibrium data for the first system was determined experimentally in a specially-designed, equilibrium bomb. A technique was developed to withdraw samples under pressure for analysis by chromatography and titration. The extraction plant was commissioned with a kerosine-water system; detailed operating procedures were developed based on a Hazard and Operability Study. Experimental runs were carried out with both ternary ammonia systems. With the system Toluene-Methylcyclohexane-Ammonia the extraction plant and the solvent recovery facility, operated satisfactorily, and safely,in accordance with the operating procedures.

40|$|The {{rotating}} {{biological contactor}} process offers the specific advantages of a biofilm system in treatment of wastewater for removal of soluble organic substances. It is a unique adaptation of the movingmedium biofilm system which facilitates easy and effective oxygen transfer. Media {{in the form of}} several large flat or corrugated discs with biofilm attached to the surface is mounted on a common shaft partially submerged in the wastewater and rotated through contoured tanks in which wastewater flows on a continuous basis. The compactness of the system and its economical operation makes it a viable option specially suited for decentralized wastewater treatment technologies. The process optimisation and adaptability under different environmental conditions and influent characteristics remain challenging tasks for the efficient use of this technology. Oxygen is accepted {{to be one of the}} most important and often limiting substrates in an aerobic treatment process. Oxygen transfer through the water film developed on a rotating disc revealed that the oxygen transfer coefficient varies with the rotational speed and the location on the exposed disc surface. Increase of ambient temperature resulted in decrease of the oxygen mass transfer rate. The biofilm model was implemented for a three <b>stage</b> rotating biological <b>contactor</b> based on a laboratory-scale experimental set-up.

40|$|A {{flowsheet}} for a novel GANEX (Grouped ActiNide EXtraction) {{process has}} been tested in a spiked flowsheet trial in a 32 <b>stage</b> plutonium-active centrifugal <b>contactor</b> rig with a simulant feed that contained 10 g/L plutonium {{as well as some}} fission products and other transuranic actinides. The solvent system used was a combination of 0. 2 mol/L N,N,N’,N’-tetraoctyl diglycolamide (TODGA) and 0. 5 mol/L N,N‘-(dimethyl-N,N‘-dioctylhexylethoxy-malonamide (DMDOHEMA) in a kerosene diluent that co-extracted actinides and lanthanides. Actinides were subsequently selectively co-stripped away from the lanthanides using a sulphonated and, therefore, hydrophilic bis-triazinyl pyridine (BTP) complexant in conjunction with acetohydroxamic acid (AHA). Plutonium and americium recoveries were high with decontamination factors across the strip contactors of ~ 14, 000 and ~ 390 respectively. However, approximately 30 % of neptunium was lost to the aqueous raffinate which was due to a large recycle within the first extract-scrub section. Some recycle of strontium was also observed but in this case it was fully directed to the raffinate stream. In the stripping section, a small fraction of europium (taken as a model lanthanide ion), ca. 7 %, was found in the actinide product stream. Modelling of selected data using the PAREX code has shown that, even with a relatively simplistic treatment, reasonable agreement between modelling and experiment can be obtained; giving confidence in the use of modelling to refine the GANEX flowsheet design prior to further testing with irradiated fast reactor fuel.

40|$|A {{mixed culture}} biofilm was {{developed}} with a sulfur oxidising, heterotrophic bacterium Thiosphaera pantotropha autotrophic nitrifiers and other heterotrophs in a three <b>stage</b> rotating biological <b>contactor</b> (RBC). Specific benefits due to peculiar properties of T. pantotropha of simultaneous heterotrophic nitrification and aerobic denitrification were derived in the reactor investigated for a combined carbon and nitrogen removal from a synthetic domestic sewage. The first stage biofilm which contained T. pantotropha showed high COD and NH 4 +-N removal rates of 5. 8 - 14. 1 g COD/m(3). d and 0. 47 - 1. 1 g N/m(2). d for the corresponding loading rates of 6. 9 - 20. 7 g COD/m(3). d and 0. 69 - 2. 09 g N/m(2). d, respectively. Contrary {{to the conventional}} units designed for a concurrent carbon removal and nitrification, the nitrification rates increased linearly {{with an increase in}} organic loading rate before stabilising at about 1 g N/m(2). d corresponding to a COD loading rate of about 15 g/m(2). d and a nitrogen loading rate of 1. 5 g N/m(2). d showing a change in the order of reaction from first to zero. A simultaneous nitrogen removal of 20 - 68 % was also obtained. The system's performance indicated that a single stage aerobic biofilm can be developed to meet the increasingly stringent regulations on effluent nitrogen discharges affording several advantages over the conventional systems, e. g. low buffer requirements, no need for external carbon source for denitrification, etc., which may result in substantial reduction in the treatment cost.

40|$|A solvent was {{developed}} at Oak Ridge National laboratory (ORNL) for a caustic-side solvent extraction (CSSX) process that removes cesium from Savannah River Site (SRS) tank waste. After treatment, {{a small fraction}} of the solvent is entrained in the caustic raffinate at a level of 100 - 300 ppm, well above the solubilities for the various solvent components. Recovery of this solvent can produce a potential cost saving in excess of $ 5 M per annum based on a processing rate of 20 gpm. In this study we examined the issues associated with the use of a coalescer for solvent recovery and measured the physical properties of the solvent and simulant. The density, surface, and interfacial tension, and viscosity of the optimized solvent and a full-component SRS waste simulant were determined as a function of temperature. The entrainment of the solvent components in the SRS waste simulant during the operation of a four-stage 4 -cm contactor unit was quantified based on chemical and volumetric analysis. The chemical stabilities of several candidate commercial coalescing media in the caustic simulant were examined. Stainless steel media showed little degradation over a 30 -day test; polymer media tended to be coated by the organic. A laboratory-scale coalescer was operated in tandem with a four <b>stage</b> 4 -cm <b>contactor</b> unit. Results indicate that a 90 % recovery of the entrained solvent can be achieved using a commercial coalescer equipped with appropriate media and at appropriate operating conditions.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with a project on mixer-settler extraction systems, as a particular example of many liquid- liquid mass transfer processes. The project was aimed at a better practical understanding of the working of such systems and to develop theoretical models, which could then be used for both design and control. The construction {{of a system of}} mixer-settler tanks is described, together with the appropriate facilities for pumping and analysis of the process chemicals. The working pilot plant has been extensively tested to discover its characteristics, when subjected to changes in both flow and boundary concentration. Mass balance principles are applied to each <b>contactor</b> <b>stage</b> to develop equations, which include in their description, the flows in each stage. These flow dynamic relationships are extended to include the settler. Laplace transform analysis is used to produce a simplified model of the flow dynamics. An alternative approach, using sensitivity functions, yields a simplified transfer function model that includes a time delay term. This model can adjust to the process dynamics, in real time. A digital process model, based on the mass balance equations has been developed to work on-line using a standard process control computer, under the constraints normal to such equipment. Both modelling approaches are compared against experimental results. The importance of the time varying nature of the process parameters is recognised, and possible adaptive modelling schemes examined. A new parameter adjustment method is developed using correlation techniques. Finally, modelling is considered in the context of automatic control...|$|R
40|$|The Generic TRUEX Model (GTM) {{was used}} to design a {{flowsheet}} for the TRUEX solvent extraction process {{that would be used}} to determine its instrumentation and control requirements. Sensitivity analyses of the key process variables, namely, the aqueous and organic flow rates, feed compositions, and the number of <b>contactor</b> <b>stages,</b> were carried out to assess their impact on the operation of the TRUEX process. Results of these analyses provide a basis for the selection of an instrument and control system and the eventual implementation of a control algorithm. Volume Two of this report is an evaluation of the instruments available for measuring many of the physical parameters. Equations that model the dynamic behavior of the TRUEX process have been generated. These equations can be used to describe the transient or dynamic behavior of the process for a given flowsheet in accordance with the TRUEX model. Further work will be done with the dynamic model to determine how and how quickly the system responds to various perturbations. The use of perturbation analysis early in the design stage will lead to a robust flowsheet, namely, one that will meet all process goals and allow for wide control bounds. The process time delay, that is, the speed with which the system reaches a new steady state, is an important parameter in monitoring and controlling a process. In the future, instrument selection and point-of-variable measurement, now done using the steady-state results reported here, will be reviewed and modified as necessary based on this dynamic method of analysis...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} waste feed and solvent limits for the Modular Caustic-Side Solvent Extraction Unit (MCU) currently being {{designed and built}} at the Savannah River Site (SRS) to remove cesium from highly alkaline radioactive waste. The study involved proposing ranges for 12 waste feed components (i. e., Na{sup +}, K{sup +}, Cs{sup +}, OH{sup -}, NO{sub 3 }{sup -}, NO{sub 2 }{sup -}, Cl{sup -}, F{sup -}, SO{sub 4 }{sup 2 -}, PO{sub 4 }{sup 3 -}, and CO{sub 3 }{sup 2 -}, and AlO{sub 2 }{sup -}) through a compilation of SRS waste data. Statistical design methods were used to generate numerous wastes with varying compositions from the proposed ranges. An Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) model called SXFIT was used to predict the cesium extraction distribution coefficients (D-values) between the organic (solvent) phase and the aqueous waste phase using the waste component concentrations as inputs. The D-values from the SXFIT model were used as input along with MCU base case process parameters to a SASSE (Spreadsheet Algorithm for Stagewise Solvent Extraction) model to calculate final cesium concentrations for the MCU. The SASSE model was developed at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). The SXFIT D-value and the waste component concentration data were used to develop a handier alternative model (neural network model) to the SXFIT model that predicts D-values within 15 % of the SXFIT D-values. Both the SXFIT and the neural network model revealed the following. The solvent extractant concentration ratios are approximately equal to the corresponding D-value ratios; a useful feature {{that could be used}} to predict extraction D-values when the extractant concentration in the solvent changes in the MCU operation. Also, potassium is the only waste component out of the 12 that shows a distinct relationship with the cesium extraction D-values; an indication of potassium's competition with cesium in the Caustic-Side Solvent Extraction (CSSX) process. A waste feed acceptance model suitable for assessing wastes within relatively wide ranges of D-values (0. 6 - 40) and initial cesium- 137 concentrations (0. 2 - 12. 8 Ci/gal) has been developed from the SASSE outputs. The waste feed acceptance model is an equation involving initial cesium- 137 concentration and D-value that results in a final cesium- 137 concentration of 0. 1 Ci/gal, the target concentration for the MCU. For example, the waste feed acceptance model shows the minimum acceptable extraction D-value based on MCU base conditions is 5. 73. The waste feed acceptance model is defined by a simple linear relationship for extraction D-values {ge} 7. This facilitates quicker calculations. For a given extraction D-value, final cesium- 137 concentration (C{sub f}) and initial cesium- 137 concentration (C{sub 0 }) are linearly related; while for a given C{sub 0 }, log (C{sub f}) and log (extraction D-value) are linear with a slope of - 1. 43. These two relationships allow one to quickly calculate C{sub f} at other MCU conditions without resorting to the SASSE model. The SASSE runs indicate that broad changes in the MCU process parameters for the extraction, scrub and strip stages (i. e., flow rate, temperature, fraction of interstage carryover, total liquid volume per <b>contactor</b> <b>stage,</b> and efficiency per <b>contactor</b> <b>stage)</b> will not result in C{sub f} exceeding target, at least for the MCU base conditions...|$|R
40|$|The TRUEX {{process is}} being {{evaluated}} at the Idaho Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP) for {{the separation of}} the actinides from acidic radioactive wastes stored at the ICPP. These efforts have culminated in recent demonstrations of the TRUEX process with actual tank waste. The first demonstration was performed in 1996 using 24 stages of 2 -cm diameter centrifugal contactors and waste from tank WM- 183. Based on the results of this flowsheet demonstration, the flowsheet was optimized and a second flowsheet demonstration was performed. This test also was performed using 2 -cm diameter centrifugal contactors and waste from tank WM- 183. However, the total number of <b>contactor</b> <b>stages</b> was reduced from 24 to 20. Also, the concentration of HEDPA in the strip solution was reduced from 0. 04 M to 0. 01 M in order to minimize the amount of phosphate in the HLW fraction, which would be immobilized into a glass waste form. This flowsheet demonstration was performed using centrifugal contactors installed in the shielded hot cell at the ICPP Remote Analytical Laboratory. The flowsheet tested consisted of six extraction stages, four scrub stages, six strip stages, two solvent was stages, and two acid rinse stages. An overall removal efficiency of 99. 79 % was obtained for the actinides. As a result, the activity of the actinides was reduced from 540 nCi/g in the feed to 0. 90 nCi/g in the aqueous raffinate, which is well below the NRC Class A LLW requirement of 10 nCi/g for non-TRU waste.

40|$|During Modular Caustic-Side Solvent Extraction (CSSX) Unit (MCU) operations, Cs- 137 {{concentrations}} in product streams will {{vary depending on}} the location in the process and on the recent process conditions. Calculations of cesium concentrations under a variety of operating conditions reveal the following: (1) Under nominal operations with salt solution feed containing 1. 1 Ci Cs- 137 per gallon, the maximum Cs- 137 concentration in the process will occur in the strip effluent (SE) and equal 15 - 16. 5 Ci/gal. (2) Under these conditions, the majority of the solvent will contain 0. 005 to 0. 01 Ci/gal, with a limited portion of the solvent in the <b>contactor</b> <b>stages</b> containing {approx} 4 Ci/gal. (3) When operating conditions yield product near 0. 1 Ci Cs- 137 /gal in the decontaminated salt solution (DSS), the SE cesium concentration will be the same or lower than in nominal operations, but majority of the stripped solvent will increase to {approx} 2 - 3 Ci/gal. (4) Deviations in strip and waste stream flow rates cause the largest variations in cesium content: (a) If strip flow rates deviate by - 30 % of nominal, the SE will contain {approx} 23 Ci/gal, although the cesium content of the solvent will increase to only 0. 03 Ci/gal; (b) If strip flow rate deviates by - 77 % (i. e., 23 % of nominal), the SE will contain 54 Ci/gal and solvent will contain 1. 65 Ci/gal. At this point, the product DSS will just reach the limit of 0. 1 Ci/gal, causing the DSS gamma monitors to alarm; and (c) Moderate (+ 10 to + 30 %) deviations in waste flow rate cause approximately proportional increases in the SE and solvent cesium concentrations. Recovery from a process failure due to poor cesium stripping can achieve any low cesium concentration required. Passing the solvent back through the contactors while recycling DSS product will produce a {approx} 70 % reduction during one pass through the contactors (assuming the stripping D value is no worse than 0. 36). If the solvent is returned to the solvent hold tank (containing additional, unstripped solvent), 3. 3 tank turnovers will reduce the cesium content by an order of magnitude. Under these conditions, the solvent cesium concentration can be reduced to < 0. 03 Ci/gal during 8 hours at nominal solvent flow rates (2. 8 gpm) ...|$|R
40|$|Researchers {{successfully}} {{demonstrated the}} chemistry and process equipment of the Caustic-Side Solvent Extraction (CSSX) flowsheet using MaxCalix for the decontamination of high level waste (HLW). The demonstration was completed using a 12 -stage, 2 -cm centrifugal contactor apparatus at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL). This represents the first CSSX process {{demonstration of the}} MaxCalix solvent system with Savannah River Site (SRS) HLW. Two tests lasting 24 and 27 hours processed non-radioactive simulated Tank 49 H waste and actual Tank 49 H HLW, respectively. Conclusions from this work include the following. The CSSX process is capable of reducing {sup 137 }Cs in high level radioactive waste {{by a factor of}} more than 40, 000 using five extraction, two scrub, and five strip stages. Tests demonstrated extraction and strip section stage efficiencies of greater than 93 % for the Tank 49 H waste test and greater than 88 % for the simulant waste test. During a test with HLW, researchers processed 39 liters of Tank 49 H solution and the waste raffinate had an average decontamination factor (DF) of 6. 78 E+ 04, with a maximum of 1. 08 E+ 05. A simulant waste solution ({approx} 34. 5 liters) with an initial Cs concentration of 83. 1 mg/L was processed and had an average DF greater than 5. 9 E+ 03, with a maximum DF of greater than 6. 6 E+ 03. The difference may be attributable to differences in <b>contactor</b> <b>stage</b> efficiencies. Test results showed the solvent can be stripped of cesium and recycled for {approx} 25 solvent turnovers without the occurrence of any measurable solvent degradation or negative effects from minor components. Based on the performance of the 12 -stage 2 -cm apparatus with the Tank 49 H HLW, the projected DF for MCU with seven extraction, two scrub, and seven strip stages operating at a nominal efficiency of 90 % is {approx} 388, 000. At 95 % stage efficiency, the DF in MCU would be {approx} 3. 2 million. Carryover of organic solvent in aqueous streams (and aqueous in organic streams) was less than 0. 1 % when processing Tank 49 H HLW. The entrained solvent concentration measured in the decontaminated salt solution (DSS) was as much as {approx} 140 mg/L, although that value may be overstated by as much as 50 % due to modifier solubility in the DSS. The entrained solvent concentration was measured in the strip effluent (SE) and the results are pending. A steady-state concentration factor (CF) of 15. 9 was achieved with Tank 49 H HLW. Cesium distribution ratios [D(Cs) ] were measured with non-radioactive Tank 49 H waste simulant and actual Tank 49 H waste. Below is a comparison of D(Cs) values of ESS and 2 -cm tests. Batch Extraction-Strip-Scrub (ESS) tests yielded D(Cs) values for extraction of {approx} 81 - 88 for tests with Tank 49 H waste and waste simulant. The results from the 2 -cm contactor tests were in agreement with values of 58 - 92 for the Tank 49 H HLW test and 54 - 83 for the simulant waste test. These values are consistent with the reference D(Cs) for extraction of {approx} 60. In tests with Tank 49 H waste and waste simulant, batch ESS tests measured D(Cs) values for the two scrub stages as {approx} 3. 5 - 5. 0 for the first scrub stage and {approx} 1. 0 - 3. 0 for the second scrub stage. In the Tank 49 H test, the D(Cs) values for the 2 -cm test were far from the ESS values. A D(Cs) value of 161 was measured for the first scrub stage and 10. 8 for the second scrub stage. The data suggest that the scrub stage is not operating as effectively as intended. For the simulant test, a D(Cs) value of 1. 9 was measured for the first scrub stage; the sample from the second scrub stage was compromised. Measurements of the pH of all stage samples for the Tank 49 H test showed that the pH for extraction and scrub stages was 14 and the pH for the strip stages was {approx} 7. It is expected that the pH of the second scrub stage would be {approx} 12 - 13. Batch ESS tests measured D(Cs) values for the strip stages to be {approx} 0. 002 - 0. 010. A high value in Strip No. 3 of a test with simulant solution has been attributed to issues associated with the limits of detection for the analytical method. In the 2 -cm contactor tests, the first four strip stages of the Tank 49 H waste test and all five strip stages in the simulant waste test had higher values than the ESS tests. Only the fifth strip stage D(Cs) value of the Tank 49 H waste test matched that of the ESS tests. It is speculated that the less-than-optimal performance of the strip section is caused by inefficiencies in the scrub section. Because strip is sensitive to pH, the elevated pH value in the second scrub stage may be the cause of strip performance. In spite of the D(Cs) values obtained in the scrub and strip sections, testing showed that the solvent system is robust. Average DFs for the process far exceeded targets even though the scrub and strip stages did not function optimally. Correction of the issue in the scrub and strip stages is expected to yield even higher waste DFs...|$|R
