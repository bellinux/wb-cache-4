5|$|Liverpool were {{appearing}} in their third UEFA Cup final, both their previous {{appearances in the}} final in 1973 and 1976 had resulted in victory. They were also making their first appearance in a European final since their ban from European competition following the Heysel Stadium disaster. Alavés {{on the other hand}} were {{appearing in}} their first European final in their first season in European competition. Remarkably, the club had been in the Fourth Division of the Spanish league system 11 years ago. As it was their first season in Europe, Alavés had commissioned a special <b>shirt</b> <b>that</b> was pink and bore the names of all their 'socios' (members) as a memento of their qualification for Europe.|$|E
5|$|While using Dante's terza rima style, {{the poem}} {{continues}} by describing the Battle of Britain. The image of warfare merges with {{the depiction of}} Pentecost, and the Holy Spirit is juxtaposed with the air-raids on London. In the second section, a ghost, representing the poets of the past stuck between worlds, begins talking to the narrator of the poem. The ghost discusses change, art in general, and how humankind is flawed. The only way to overcome the problematic condition of humanity, according to the ghost, is to experience purgation through fire. The fire is described {{in a manner similar}} to Julian of Norwich's writing about God's love and discussed in relationship to the shirt of Nessus, a <b>shirt</b> <b>that</b> burns its wearer. Little Gidding continues by describing the eternalness of the present and how history exists in a pattern. The poem concludes by explaining how sacrifice is needed to allow an individual to die into life and be reborn, and that salvation should be the goal of humankind.|$|E

A few nights later, wearing a Western <b>shirt</b> <b>that</b> Mary had made for him, he overcame his shyness and appeared on the program playing guitar, singing, and yodeling. A few days later, {{he was asked to}} join a local country music group, the Rocky Mountaineers. He accepted the group's offer and became a member in August 1931.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1996–97 season, Beckham was given the number 10 <b>shirt</b> <b>that</b> had most recently been worn by Mark Hughes. On 17 August 1996 (the first day of the Premier League season), Beckham became something of a household name when he scored a spectacular goal in a match against Wimbledon. With United leading 2–0, Beckham noticed that Wimbledon's goalkeeper Neil Sullivan was standing a long way out of his goal, and hit a shot from the halfway line that floated over the goalkeeper and into the net.|$|E

Stokes made his debut for the Blades in the local derby against Sheffield Wednesday a few days later, coming on as a second-half substitute. Stokes started his time at Bramall Lane as a first team regular but was soon dropped to the bench and returned to Sunderland having made 12 appearances but failed to score a goal.|$|E

25|$|In 1976, {{the club}} endured a drastic change to their kits, {{ditching}} the all-white uniforms for an all-red style, akin to English club Liverpool. The club wore the kits {{up until the}} 1989–90 season, with the 1977–78 and 1978–79 seasons being excluded due to the club adding navy blue vertical stripes to the <b>shirt</b> <b>that</b> was deemed unsuccessful. Following the 1989–90 season, the club returned to the all-white kits and, {{at the start of}} the 1995–96 season, the club returned the vertical stripes, but opted to insert them in the center of the shirt, instead of to the left. The club kept this style until the 2001–02 season. For the 2009–10 season, Lyon returned the horizontal red and blue stripes. In the Champions League, Lyon has used a variety of different colours as first choice, including red, navy blue, light blue, black, silver and fluorescent yellow.|$|E
25|$|Tzotzil {{speakers}} number {{just slightly}} less than theTzeltals at 226,000, although those of the ethnicity are probably higher. Tzotzils {{are found in the}} highlands or Los Altos and spread out towards the northeast near the border with Tabasco. However, Tzotzil communities can be found in almost every municipality of the state. They are concentrated in Chamula, Zinacantán, Chenalhó, and Simojovel. Their language is closely related to Tzeltal and distantly related to Yucatec Mayan and Lacandon. Men dress in short pants tied with a red cotton belt and a <b>shirt</b> <b>that</b> hangs down to their knees. They also wear leather huaraches and a hat decorated with ribbons. The women wear a red or blue skirt, a short huipil as a blouse, and use a chal or rebozo to carry babies and bundles. Tzotzil communities are governed by a katinab who is selected for life by the leaders of each neighborhood. The Tzotzils are also known for their continued use of the temazcal for hygiene and medicinal purposes.|$|E

25|$|A {{break in}} the case came in 1998, when police noticed that broken {{concrete}} at Miracle Motors, a business owned by Karyn's ex-father-in-law Michael Slover Sr, were similar to concrete blocks used to weigh down Karyn's body. A forensic geologist {{was brought in to}} see if anything on the Slovers' business matched evidence found {{at the scene of the}} crime. The geologist found that not only was the concrete consistent with that found at Miracle Motors, but that evidence found in the abandoned car was also likely from Slover's business. The task force sifted through dirt at Miracle Motors and eventually discovered a metal rivet and a plastic button that fit a pair of Paris Club jeans and a white <b>shirt</b> <b>that</b> Karyn had been wearing the day of her murder. Police also reported finding bones at the scene, but these were not introduced to trial and were believed to have been animal meat bones that came from food fed to two dogs that Slover used to secure the property.|$|E
25|$|Manchester United had {{a number}} of players missing due to injury. Edwin van der Sar {{strained}} his calf in the warm-up before United's FA Cup match against Middlesbrough on 10 March, and Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidić picked up knocks in the same game. Other long-term injury concerns included Mikaël Silvestre (dislocated shoulder), Darren Fletcher (ankle), Louis Saha (hamstring) and Ole Gunnar Solskjær (knee). However, Alan Smith was available as he made his recovery from a broken leg and dislocated ankle he suffered in February 2006. There were also places in the team for youngsters Kieran Richardson, Chris Eagles and Tom Heaton, while Dong Fangzhuo – recently returned from a loan spell at Royal Antwerp after receiving a UK work permit – was added to the first-team squad to bolster a depleted strike force. Despite Sir Alex Ferguson's earlier assertions that the Manchester United team would be entirely composed of current players, they had a guest player of their own: Andy Cole – then of Portsmouth – made a return to Old Trafford in the number 9 <b>shirt</b> <b>that</b> he had worn for the majority of his career there.|$|E
25|$|On August 31, 2012, Dempsey joined Tottenham Hotspur on {{a three-year}} {{contract}} for a fee {{believed to be in}} the region of $9million. The deal made Dempsey the highest salaried U.S. soccer player of all time. With the 23 <b>shirt</b> <b>that</b> he wore at Fulham and the number 8 that he usually wears on international duty unavailable, he opted for the number 2 jersey, more usually associated with the right-back, which he wore at Furman University. Dempsey scored his first and the eventual match-winning goal for Tottenham in a 3–2 win over Manchester United. It {{was the first time in}} 23 years that Tottenham had won at Old Trafford. He scored his second goal for Spurs in the 39th minute in an away game at Southampton in October. Dempsey's third and fourth goals were scored against Everton in an eventual 2–1 loss and a deflected effort against Reading on New Year's Day to help his Spurs side win 3–1. In the FA Cup 3rd round he scored a double against Coventry City. On January 20, 2013, in driving snow at White Hart Lane against league leaders Manchester United, Dempsey was able to salvage a dramatic 1–1 draw for Spurs by slotting home a pass from Aaron Lennon in the 93rd minute. The goal was his fourth in four appearances in 2013. On January 27, 2013, Dempsey scored a looping header against Leeds United at Elland Road, in the FA Cup to bring the score to 2–1, however Tottenham Hotspur couldn't draw level throughout the rest of the game, leaving the result at 2–1 to Leeds at the whistle. Dempsey was unable to make an impression against his old club on March 17, when Fulham came away from White Hart Lane with a 1–0 victory. On April 21, Dempsey scored the first of three goals for Tottenham in a 3–1 win over Manchester City at White Hart Lane. On May 12, Dempsey scored a long range goal and added an assist while playing against Stoke City to help Spurs win 2–1 and keep them in contention for the fourth Champions League spot.|$|E

Sugar had also been pushing for a Marceline and Ice King musical episode. Sugar was responsible for designing Marceline's look in the episode. According to her, the <b>shirt</b> <b>that</b> Marceline wears was [...] "loosely based off a stretched out old D.A.R.E. shirt." [...] The original working title for the episode was [...] "Help". Former storyboard artist and creative director for the series Adam Muto joked that the change was made due to the famous Beatles song of the same name.|$|E

Lisa does win a special prize in the geography pageant, as Homer's poor costume design gives Lisa the appearance that she did the work all by herself. Ralph receives the same prize, as his costume is simply a note taped to his <b>shirt</b> <b>that</b> reads [...] "Idaho".|$|E
