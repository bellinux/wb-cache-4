40|$|Saving is {{in essence}} {{a source of}} finance. According to the well known Keynesian identities which found {{practical}} application {{in the framework of}} National Accounts, <b>saving</b> and investment (<b>capital</b> formation) represent identical (ex post) macroeconomic aggregates for the economy as a whole. Saving and capital formation within a macroeconomic institutional sector will, however, only be identical in exceptional circumstances. The corporate sector has since 1985 up to 2000 displayed excess <b>saving</b> over <b>capital</b> formation. This phenomenon was prominent during the nineties. The corporate sector is also responsible for the largest contribution to total <b>saving</b> and total <b>capital</b> formation in the South African economy. The meaning of the excess <b>saving</b> over <b>capital</b> formation is that there was no shortage of the supply of <b>saving</b> for financing <b>capital</b> formation. Conversely, capital formation has not responded {{in the same manner as}} to the availability of saving. Corporate saving expressed as a ratio to gross domestic product has, despite an excess <b>saving</b> over <b>capital</b> formation, exhibited a downward trend during the nineties. This has obviously impacted negatively on the total savings rate of South Africa. Although the level of corporate saving has been smaller than corporate capital formation in 2001 and 2002, both aggregates have improved during 2002 when expressed as a ratio of gross domestic product. Although various reasons may be cited for the rather sluggish performance of <b>saving</b> and <b>capital</b> formation amidst excess saving, this study is to provide a macroeconomic perspective on the cost of capital and profitability explaining the under performance of <b>saving</b> and <b>capital</b> formation. Other than saving, debt financing represents one of the most important financing elements for businesses. Particular suitable circumstances from a viewpoint of cost of capital have developed during the nineties wherefrom saving as a financing element could have flourished. A preference for saving to debt financing has developed. Macroeconomically, businesses always finance with a combination of saving and debt resulting in a weighted average cost of capital. Macroeconomic profitability and macroeconomic cost of capital have to complement each other in order to channel any finance, including <b>saving,</b> optimally to <b>capital</b> formation. A structural change pertaining to profitability during the nineties has limited this condition. This has affected <b>saving</b> and <b>capital</b> formation negatively during the second half of the nineties impacting on total <b>saving</b> and <b>capital</b> formation. It is only during 2002 that the savings rate has shown improvement from historical low levels. This has gone hand in hand with the cost of capital and profitability being more complementary. An excess <b>saving</b> over <b>capital</b> formation as such is no guarantee for an improved rate of capital formation. Requests for more saving from the corporate sector amidst circumstances that were present during the second half of the nineties in order to alleviate the low savings rate in South Africa should be critically questioned. Circumstances in which <b>saving</b> and <b>capital</b> formation may improve from historical low levels are from a financing point of view heavily dependant on both the weighted average cost of capital and profitability which have to maintain sustainable margins in the future.

40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2010. The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{investigate}} optimal asset allocation as a means of minimising the investment risk, drawdown risk and longevity risk associated with an investment linked living annuity. The three risk elements were tested for various categories of retirees investing the full retirement savings amount in a living annuity. At first the paper examines the South African public's current pre-retirement savings habits, propensity to save and knowledge on the financial industry. The literature concludes that very few people are saving adequately for retirement, thus leaving a gap between required retirement <b>savings</b> <b>capital</b> and accumulated retirement <b>savings</b> <b>capital.</b> As a consequence, retirees have to take on more risk, usually in the form of equity exposure, (only available in an investment linked living annuity) or delaying retirement, to try and breach the gap. Secondly the paper examines the constructs in developing an optimal asset allocation. An analysis of the constructs includes risk versus return relationships for retirees, various unit trust sectors and portfolios within the South African financial market, the investment horizon also stated as the life expectancy of a retiree and withdrawal strategies applied by investors or retirees. The practical data and theory from the literature study formed the basis of the empirical study where different retirement savings balances were tested at various drawdown rates and asset allocations in an investment linked living annuity. The study concluded that retirees have to consider, among other factors, the required standard of living (stated as a net replacement ratio), the need to withdraw one third of the retirement capital and life expectancy before investing in an investment linked living annuity. These factors will have the biggest influence on the risks associated with an investment linked living annuity. Furthermore, the study concluded that an optimal asset allocation would be able to support a retiree during the post-retirement phase. A well diversified portfolio with a minimum of 50 % allocation towards equity and property assets seems to be optimal. Master...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{surveys the}} {{existing}} {{theoretical and empirical}} literature {{on the relationship between}} taxes and economic growth, with special reference to developing economies. It reports on studies of tax mix and tax policies and their influence on <b>savings</b> and <b>capital</b> formation. These studies are divided into those adopting a positive approach (empirical studies) and those that discuss tax reform issues following a normative approach. Although there are no universal laws (valid for all countries at all times) concerning the influence of the tax mix and tax policies on a nation’s savings and growth, there are some inferences that can be drawn from the studies that are discussed here. Taxation, in its various forms, affects the ability and willingness of an individual to work, save and invest. These effects vary, depending on the base of the tax, the rate structure of the tax and the level of the tax burden. Several {{studies have shown that the}} structure of taxation can have a major influence on the real sector and that taxation policy can therefore be an important tool for promoting <b>saving,</b> <b>capital</b> formation and economic growth. This applies to both developed and developing economies, although there are significant differences in the tax mix and tax structure between countries at different levels of economic development. In this paper the theoretical and empirical literature on the influence of taxation on <b>savings</b> and <b>capital</b> formation is surveyed, with special reference to developing economies. The first section looks at the theoretical and empirical linkages between savings and its major determinants – income, the interest rate and other factors. This is followed by a section dealing with the determinants of investment. The next section covers the empirical literature on the relationship between tax, <b>savings</b> and <b>capital</b> formation.

40|$|This paper aims {{to study}} the {{stability}} properties of a two-period over- lapping generations model (OLG) with a progressive labor-income taxa- tion rule. In this case, wage income tax rates are increasing with agent's income. Each representative agent lives two periods: youth and adult- hood. In the first period, agents choose labor supply and allocate their after-tax income between consumptions and <b>savings</b> (<b>capital</b> accumula- tions). In the second period, agents are retired and consume entirely their savings returns. It is shown that progressive labor-income taxation policy acts as a destabilizing factor {{in the sense that}} a higher progressivity makes the emergence of indeterminacy and endogenous fluctuations more likely. These fluctuations appear if the elasticity of capital-labor substi- tution is sufficiently low. Moreover, we show that saving rate widens the range of parameters giving rise to endogenous fluctuations. The analytical findings are completed by a numerical example. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{central role}} of forests in rural livelihoods, {{especially}} {{for the poor and}} the marginalized, suggests that when exploited to full potential these resources could facilitate rural poverty alleviation. However, this is constrained by the factors that characterize the poor, including low levels of education, low levels of asset holding, poor health, lack of power and opportunities to be heard, weak local institutions and unfavourable institutional frameworks. In some areas, forests have lifted rural people out of poverty by enabling significant income generation, mobilization of <b>savings,</b> <b>capital</b> accumulation, and asset-building. This chapter highlights promising opportunities for forest-based poverty alleviation, and the prerequisites for their exploitation. Much of the evidence suggests that sustained welfare gains for the great majority of forest dependent people will require broader macro-level investments beyond forests and natural resources.
