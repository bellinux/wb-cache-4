50|$|As an {{oxidizing}} agent, <b>sodium</b> <b>percarbonate</b> is {{an ingredient}} {{in a number}} of home and laundry cleaning products, including non-chlorine bleach products such as OxyBoost, OxiClean, Tide laundry detergent, and Vanish.

50|$|The {{peroxide}} anion is {{a stronger}} nucleophile than hydroxide and displaces hydroxyl from oxyanions e.g. forming perborates and percarbonates. Sodium perborate and <b>sodium</b> <b>percarbonate</b> are important consumer and industrial bleaching agents; they stabilize hydrogen peroxide and limit side reactions (e.g. reduction and decomposition note below).

It is a skin irritant and can cause allergic reactions in some people, so the company now advises the use of gloves during prolonged exposure.|$|E
50|$|Bleaching is {{a process}} for {{whitening}} fabrics which has been practiced for thousands of years. Sometimes {{it was simply a}} matter of leaving the fabric in the sun, to be faded by the bright light. In the 18th century several scientists developed varieties of chlorine bleach, including sodium hypochlorite and calcium hypochlorite (bleaching powder). Bleaching agents that do not contain chlorine most often are based on peroxides, such as hydrogen peroxide, <b>sodium</b> <b>percarbonate</b> and sodium perborate. While most bleaches are oxidizing agents, a fewer number are reducing agents such as sodium dithionite.|$|E
5000|$|The {{oxidation}} of pyridine can {{be achieved}} {{with a number of}} peracids including peracetic acid and perbenzoic acid in a reaction that affords the protonated derivative.

[...] More recent reported approaches include a modified Dakin reaction using a urea-hydrogen peroxide complex, and oxidation by sodium perborate or, using methylrhenium trioxide (...) as catalyst, with <b>sodium</b> <b>percarbonate.</b> [...] Pyridine N-oxide is five orders of magnitude less basic than pyridine, but it is isolable as a hydrochloride salt, C5H5NOHCl, via a synthesis reported in Organic Syntheses: ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{main targets}} of bleaches are oxidisible organic stains; {{which are usually}} of {{vegetable}} origin (e.g. chlorophyll, anthocyanin dyes, tannins, humic acids, andcarotenoid pigments). Despite the name, modern beaching agents do not include household bleach (sodium hypochlorite). Laundry bleaches are typically stable adducts of hydrogen peroxide, such as sodium perborate and <b>sodium</b> <b>percarbonate,</b> these are inactive as solids but will react with water to release hydrogen peroxide which performs the bleaching action. [...] "Bleach activators" [...] such as tetraacetylethylenediamine (TAED) may also be used, these react with hydrogen peroxide to produce peracetic acid, which is an even more effective bleach.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{inorganic}} peroxides {{are used}} for bleaching textiles and paper and as a bleaching additive to detergents and cleaning products. The increasing environmental concerns resulted in the preference of peroxides over chlorine-based compounds and {{a sharp increase in}} the peroxide production. The past use of perborates as additives to detergents and cleaning products has been largely replaced by percarbonates in order to decrease the emission of boron to the environment. <b>Sodium</b> <b>percarbonate</b> is used in such products as OxiClean and Tide laundry detergent. When dissolved in water, it releases hydrogen peroxide and soda ash (sodium carbonate): ...|$|E
5000|$|Bleach is a {{chemical}} that whitens clothing.The bleaching {{process has been}} known for millennia, but the chemicals currently used for bleaching resulted from the work of several 18th century scientists. Chlorine is the basis for the most common bleaches: for example, the solution of sodium hypochlorite, which is so ubiquitous that most simply call it [...] "bleach", and calcium hypochlorite, the active compound in [...] "bleaching powder". Oxidizing bleaching agents that do not contain chlorine are usually based on peroxides such as hydrogen peroxide, <b>sodium</b> <b>percarbonate</b> and sodium perborate. While most bleaches are oxidizing agents, some are reducing agents such as sodium dithionite and sodium borohydride.|$|E
5000|$|TAED is an {{important}} component of laundry detergents that use [...] "active oxygen" [...] bleaching agents. Active oxygen bleaching agents include sodium perborate, <b>sodium</b> <b>percarbonate,</b> sodium perphosphate, sodium persulfate, and urea peroxide. These compounds release hydrogen peroxide during the wash cycle. Hydrogen peroxide is however an inefficient bleach below 60 C. TAED and hydrogen peroxide react to form peroxyacetic acid, a more efficient bleach, allowing lower temperature wash cycles, around 40 C. TAED was first used in a commercial laundry detergent in 1978 (Skip by Unilever). Currently, TAED is the main bleach activator used in European laundry detergents and has an estimated annual consumption of 75 kt.|$|E
50|$|Sodium nonanoyloxybenzenesulfonate (NOBS) is an {{important}} component of laundry detergents and bleaches. It is known as a bleach activator for active oxygen sources, allowing formulas containing hydrogen peroxide releasing chemicals (specifically sodium perborate, <b>sodium</b> <b>percarbonate,</b> sodium perphosphate, sodium persulfate, and urea peroxide to effect bleaching at lower temperatures. NOBS was developed by Procter & Gamble in 1983 and was first used in American laundry detergents in 1988. NOBS is the main bleach activator used in the U.S.A. and Japan. Compared to TAED, which is the predominant bleach activator used in Europe, NOBS is efficient at much lower temperatures. At 20 °C NOBS is 100 times more soluble than TAED in water. When attacked by the perhydroxyl anion (from hydrogen peroxide), NOBS forms the peroxy acid peroxynonanoic acid and releases the leaving group sodium 4-hydroxybenzene sulfonate, which is an inert by-product.|$|E
5000|$|Roof {{cleaning}} is {{the process}} to remove algae mold, mildew, lichen and moss from roofs. Roof cleaning can extend the duration of a roof's ability to function. Algae {{and other types of}} build-up often form on the north and west parts of roofs that are shaded or receive less sun, and can reduce a roof's life expectancy. The presence of soot, dirt, or biomass can affect how much sunlight is absorbed by a roof and thus the amount of heat a building absorbs. [...] Cleaning may be accomplished with a sodium hypochlorite (a.k.a.bleach) or <b>sodium</b> <b>percarbonate</b> solution, various cleaning products or commercial cleaning services. The Asphalt Roofing Manufacturers Association (ARMA) recommends using a 50/50 solution of laundry grade bleach and water to remove moss and algae. The addition of zinc strips near the roof's peak may reduce the regrowth of algae and moss.|$|E
50|$|Unilever's {{research}} teams found a manganese(IV)-based catalyst that sped up the decomposition of sodium perborate and <b>sodium</b> <b>percarbonate</b> which act as bleaches in the washing process, increasing the cleaning performance noticeably and allowing use of lower temperatures. Unilever {{decided that the}} bleaching agents would be an ideal addition to the product, but had worries over such a major alteration to the formula {{of one of their}} main products (a high profile example of this being New Coke, with a more direct example being in the late 1980s when one of Persil's competitors, Daz, introduced a new formula that also increased cleaning performance, but caused allergic reactions in a small but noticeable percentage of the population). To this end they decided to split the catalyst agent (together with some fabric softening agents) into a new product, Persil Power. In May 1994, Persil Power was launched with a large publicity campaign, but a number of problems soon became apparent.|$|E
