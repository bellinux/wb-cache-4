5|$|His murder {{became a}} {{national}} cause célèbre. Several independent inquiries concluded that local government officials had been involved. However, the Bantul police early on discounted a political motive. Instead, they arrested a local driver named Dwi Sumaji for the murder, alleging a motive of jealousy. Sumaji was later acquitted after the prosecution withdrew its case owing {{to a lack of}} evidence. The police in turn were successfully sued for their mishandling of the case and deliberate destruction of evidence. The murder has never been solved, and is expected to be unprosecutable after 2014 due to Indonesia's 18-year <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> <b>on</b> murder.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Texas filed a {{trespass}} to try title suit {{to reclaim}} the lake bed for the state. In Welder v. State, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals in Austin declared the lake permanent and navigable-in-fact, granting the bed to the state under {{the purview of the}} Texas Game, Fish and Oyster Commission (later Texas Parks and Wildlife Department). Without permission from the Texas Attorney General, the Texas Land Commissioner then sold the bed to a private buyer for agricultural use in 1918. In the 1948 case of State v. Bryan, the Texas Court of Civil Appeals in Austin upheld the sale as valid under color of law, and immune from a trespass to try title suit due to the one-year <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> <b>on</b> land sales. However, under the Texas Water Rights Adjudication Act of 1967, Green Lake was classified as a public body of water. The Supreme Court of Texas affirmed this classification in 1988, rejecting the argument of the bed's then-owner {{that it was not a}} lake by definition, but a natural depression flooded with surface runoff.|$|E
5|$|Once {{registration}} {{had been}} completed and the deposits were made, the author was granted an exclusive right to control the copying of the book. Penalties for infringing this right were severe, with all infringing copies to be destroyed and large fines {{to be paid to}} both the copyright holder and the government; there was only a three-month <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> <b>on</b> bringing a case, however. This exclusive right's length was dependent on when the book had been published. If it was published after 10 April 1710, the length of copyright was 14 years; if published before that date, 21 years. An author who survived until the copyright expired would be granted an additional 14-year term, and when that ran out, the works would enter the public domain. Copyright under the Statute applied to Scotland and England, as well as Ireland when that country joined the union in 1800.|$|E

5|$|The Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles {{was founded}} in 1977 by Rabbi Marvin Hier using large {{donations}} from philanthropists Samuel Belzberg and Joseph Tennenbaum. Hier's organisation paid Wiesenthal an honorarium {{for the right to}} use his name. The center helped with the campaign to remove the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> <b>on</b> Nazi crimes and continues the hunt for suspected Nazi war criminals, but today its primary activities include Holocaust remembrance, education, and fighting antisemitism. The center's Holocaust museum, the largest in the United States, opened in 1993. Moriah Films, the center's media division, has won two Academy Awards, including one for the documentary Genocide (1982). Wiesenthal was not always happy with the way the center was run. He thought the museum was not dignified enough and that he should have a larger say in the overall operations. He even wrote to the Board of Directors requesting Hier's removal, but in the end had to be content with being a figurehead.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Limitations</b> Act <b>of</b> 1958 allows 12 {{years for}} child {{survivors}} {{and the disabled}} to make a claim, with age 37 the latest at which a claim can be made. The police submitted evidence to a commission, the Victorian Inquiry into Church and Institutional Child Abuse (in existence since 2012) indicating that it takes an average of 24 years for a survivor {{of child sexual abuse}} to go to the police. According to Attorney General Robert Clark, the government will remove <b>statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> <b>on</b> criminal child abuse; survivors of violent crime should be given additional time, as adults, to deal with the legal system. Offenders of minors and the disabled have used the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> to avoid detection and prosecution, moving from state to state and country to country; an example presented to the Victorian Inquiry was the Christian Brothers.|$|R

These charges were dropped, {{with the right}} to refile retained, on November 20, 2003. An agreement to extend the <b>statute</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitations</b> <b>on</b> these charges, allowing Oklahoma prosecutors time to see the results of federal sentencing, was signed on March 30, 2005.|$|E

This was seen as a victory for those fighting against the gender wage gap, because if a woman {{at the end of her}} career found that she had been making less money than men who were doing the same work, she now had more than six months from the date of her last pay check to file a claim and possibly receive the wages that were denied.|$|E

Ağca's lawyers applied for their client's release under Law no. 4516 on Parole and Deferral of Penalties in December 2000. Their request was denied by the 1st High Criminal Court of Kartal. The lawyers filed an appeal against this decision, but the appeals court upheld the ruling. Ağca's life sentence was reduced to 10 {{years in prison for}} murder under a Turkish law that shortened prison sentences if served in a foreign prison.

However, it apparently does not put much credence in the theory that Donati was behind the crime. Kurkjian writes that he shared the details of his conversation with the FBI {{agent in charge of the}} investigation, but at a news conference a month later, the agent did not mention Donati at all and apparently seemed to still be embracing an earlier FBI theory of the crime.|$|E

The question was rendered moot in November when a Portland grand jury returned an indictment in absentia against [...] "John Doe, aka Dan Cooper" [...] for air piracy and violation of the Hobbs Act.

The court of inquiry began on February 4, 2013. On April 19, 2013, the court of inquiry ordered Anderson to be arrested, saying “This court cannot think of a more intentionally harmful act than a prosecutor’s conscious choice to hide mitigating evidence so as to create an uneven playing field for a defendant facing a murder charge and a life sentence.” [...] Anderson responded by claiming immunity from any prosecution under the expiry <b>of</b> applicable <b>statutes</b> <b>of</b> <b>limitation.</b> <b>On</b> September 23, 2013, Anderson resigned from his position as district court judge.|$|R
40|$|Trichloroethylene (TCE) is used {{worldwide}} as {{a solvent}} and was disposed of {{in ways that}} caused disease clusters nationwide.

Case studies like Woburn, the Love Canal, Camp Lejeune, McCall, and countless clusters of disease including the Mattel/Hall Street case in Beaverton, were cause for new laws and policies such as “Honoring America’s Veterans and Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012,” and “Trevor’s Law”.
