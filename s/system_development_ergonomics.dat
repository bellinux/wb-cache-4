40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Computer Science)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. According {{to recent}} surveys {{on the use}} of <b>systems</b> <b>development</b> methodologies, many {{organizations}} claim that they are adapting <b>systems</b> <b>development</b> methodologies (Hardy et al. 1995; Russo et al. 1996; Fitzgerald, 1998). The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate the adaptation of <b>systems</b> <b>development</b> methodologies in South Africa. This problem was investigated by addressing the following research questions: • What are the perceptions of system developers regarding <b>systems</b> <b>development</b> methodologies? • Why do system developers adapt <b>system</b> <b>development</b> methodologies? • How do they adapt the methodologies? • Is there a difference in the quality of the systems which are developed with these adapted <b>systems</b> <b>development</b> methodologies opposed to those systems which are developed according to a specific formalised methodology? In this dissertation, interpretive case studies have been used to add to the researcher's knowledge concerning how and why <b>systems</b> <b>development</b> methodologies in South Africa are adapted. Qualitative interviewing was used as a data collection method. All interviews were recorded and transcribed. The next step was to analyse the transcribed data. In this study, content analysis with cross-case analysis was used. The findings obtained were confirmed by making use of triangulation and member checking. The results indicated that although the use of <b>systems</b> <b>development</b> methodologies is mandatory in organizations, it is not enforced by senior employees. Organizations use multiple <b>systems</b> <b>development</b> methodologies. <b>Systems</b> <b>development</b> methodologies are adapted due to several reasons, i. e. financial gains that is obtained, the lack of knowledge, time limitations, the fact that methodologies are not universally applicable, etc. <b>Systems</b> <b>development</b> methodologies are statically and dynamically adapted by adding and removing steps. The combination of methodologies and switching between methodologies also occur. The results indicate that developers realize that formal <b>systems</b> <b>development</b> methodologies produce <b>systems</b> of a higher quality. However, because it is so time-consuming, they are prepared to accept a lower quality system in order to gain a faster delivery time. Master...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine how and why {{ergonomics}} capability emerges and develops within organisations. This study suggests that these changes in capability can be interpreted as involving complex innovation processes which are shaped by a combination of forces both internal and external to an organisation. This perspective differs from that adopted in earlier research which has focused on the general problem of ergonomics knowledge utilisation in organisational settings. A case study approach was used to conduct the research. The case study design consisted of six organisations (three pairs) operating from a manufacturing base in New Zealand. Each organisation pair operated in one of the following product-markets: petrol pumps, electric ranges and office seating. Data were collected from in-depth interviews, documents, archival sources and through observation. The case analysis focused primarily on ergonomics capability in relation to product design and development. This study supports the need for a more dynamic conceptualisation of ergonomics knowledge use - one which recognises that as knowledge is used within an organisation, knowledge is also created. Accordingly, the analysis focused on those processes associated with the emergence and <b>development</b> of in-house <b>ergonomics</b> capability. The interpretation of these processes was informed by theories and concepts relating to organisational learning and innovation. The analysis also revealed that the emergence and <b>development</b> of <b>ergonomics</b> capability was encouraged and constrained by a range of contextual factors which included top management goals, product strategy, organisation structure and resources. Furthermore, government policy was found to be a dominant external force through its diffuse and indirect impact on the knowledge environment and industry structure. The case analysis culminates in the presentation of a general framework for understanding the emergence and <b>development</b> of <b>ergonomics</b> capability in product <b>development.</b> While <b>ergonomics</b> capability is a core concept in the model, four other major elements are identified. These are staffing routines, top management orientation, organisational configuration and history, and the external environment.

40|$|MSc (Computer Science), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Problem statement: There {{seem to be}} perceptual incongruence between <b>systems</b> <b>development</b> {{managers}} and developers. Research shows that while managers are more positive towards <b>systems</b> <b>development</b> methodologies, developers {{on the other hand}} seem to resist and not to use <b>systems</b> <b>development</b> methodologies in their entirety but instead adapt, tailor, modify and change them depending on the project at hand (contingent use). <b>Systems</b> <b>development</b> managers can exert power through a variety of influence bases. However, these power influences may be perceived differently by developers. While some might feel constrained, others might actually feel liberated by the existence of the same influence base. Main findings: IS managers are using <b>systems</b> <b>development</b> methodologies to gain control over team members. However, there was no clear perception on whether <b>systems</b> <b>development</b> methodologies were enslaving systems developers. This was indicated by the majority of the respondents neither agreeing nor disagreeing to that effect. The research showed that most organisations are adapting the use of <b>systems</b> <b>development</b> methodologies on a project to project basis, which {{is referred to as the}} contingent use of <b>systems</b> <b>development</b> methodologies. Research method followed: The positivistic research paradigm was used as it allowed the researcher to find out patterns and regularities between power, <b>systems</b> <b>development</b> methodologies’ use and success. A survey was conducted and a questionnaire was used for data collection purposes. Questionnaire data was analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 21, Release 20. 0. 0 software package tools. Principal conclusion: Power is interpreted in terms of the type of power that can be exercised by IT professionals specifically IS developers and their respective managers at the workplace. The roles assumed and the different power types that may be exercised in organisations provide a link as to who has the final say when it comes to the use and success rate of <b>systems</b> <b>development</b> methodologies.

40|$|Recent {{research}} suggests that financial <b>system</b> <b>development</b> is important for economic development and for reducing financing constraints of firms (Levine, 2005). Consequently, researchers started investigating the factors that determine financial <b>system</b> <b>development.</b> A group of factors that have been identified are institutional factors. Many researchers have investigated the theoretical and empirical links among historical institutional factors, current institutional factors, and financial <b>system</b> <b>development</b> (Beck and Levine, 2005). There are, however, few studies that have investigated extensively the theoretical and empirical links among institutional factors and financial <b>system</b> <b>development</b> within the African context. Africa provides an interesting context to empirically validate and refine many of the theories that have been postulated to explain the relationships among historical and current institutional factors and financial <b>system</b> <b>development.</b> This is because Africa {{is in the process}} of developing its institutions and reforming existing ones and offers an opportunity to examine the impact of institutional factors on financial <b>system</b> <b>development</b> in nascent contexts. Therefore, this dissertation investigated the following research question: To what extent are institutional factors determinants of financial <b>system</b> <b>development</b> in Africa? To answer this research question, this study empirically evaluated the effects on financial <b>system</b> <b>development</b> of historical institutional factors that have been identified by four theories: legal origins theory, disease endowment theory, religion-based theory, and ethnic fractionalisation theory. Moreover, current institutional factors identified by the law and finance theory as possible determinants of financial <b>system</b> <b>development</b> were empirically examined. Furthermore, the links among historical and current institutional factors were empirically studied. The results show that the disease endowment variables are the only historical institutional factors that explain cross-country variation in financial <b>system</b> <b>development</b> in Africa. Additionally, this study finds that the institutional enforcement quality and efficiency of the judicial system are the only current institutional factors that explain cross-country variation in financial <b>system</b> <b>development</b> in Africa. Current institutional factors such as the efficiency of the legal property system and the quality of the credit information infrastructure do not appear to have effects on financial <b>system</b> <b>development.</b> Moreover, the institutional enforcement quality seems to be one of the possible channels through which disease endowment affects financial <b>system</b> <b>development</b> in Africa. This study also reveals that there are few statistically significant links among historical and current institutional factors within the African context. To my knowledge, this is the first study to show some of these empirical links among historical institutional factors, current institutional factors, and financial <b>system</b> <b>development</b> for the African context. The main conclusion of this dissertation is that institutional factors seem not to be determinants of financial <b>system</b> <b>development</b> in Africa to a large extent. In essence, institutional factors appear to matter for financial <b>system</b> <b>development</b> in Africa, but not as much as might have been expected judging from many calls for institutional reforms from the World Bank and others.

However, functionalism promotes an innate and immutable instrumental rationality that is indifferent to human values, rights, society, culture and international stability.

Although alternative paradigms have been promoted for decades in the <b>systems</b> <b>development</b> literature to help address this deficit, functionalism remains dominant. This paper reiterates the call for a fundamental paradigm shift away from myopic functionalism and towards a more empathic and human-centred philosophy.
