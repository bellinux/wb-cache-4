40|$|We present NC {{approximation}} <b>schemes</b> <b>for</b> {{a number}} of graph problems when restricted to geometric graphs including unit disk graphs and graphs drawn in a civilized manner. Our approximation schemes exhibit the same time versus performance trade-off as the best known approximation <b>schemes</b> <b>for</b> planar graphs. We also define the concept of -precision unit disk graphs and show that for such graphs the approximation schemes have a better time versus performance trade-off than the approximation <b>schemes</b> <b>for</b> arbitrary unit disk graphs. Moreover, compared to unit disk graphs, we show that for -precision unit disk graphs, many more graph problems have efficient approximation schemes. Our NC approximation schemes can also be extended to obtain efficient NC approximation <b>schemes</b> <b>for</b> several PSPACE-hard problems on unit disk graphs specified using a restricted version of the hierarchical specification language of Bentley, Ottmann and Widmayer. The approximation <b>schemes</b> <b>for</b> hierarchically specified un [...] ...|$|R
