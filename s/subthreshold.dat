25|$|According to {{the basic}} {{threshold}} model, the transistor is turned off, {{and there is no}} conduction between drain and source. A more accurate model considers the effect of thermal energy on the Fermi–Dirac distribution of electron energies which allow some of the more energetic electrons at the source to enter the channel and flow to the drain. This results in a <b>subthreshold</b> current that is an exponential function of gate–source voltage. While the current between drain and source should ideally be zero when the transistor is being used as a turned-off switch, there is a weak-inversion current, sometimes called <b>subthreshold</b> leakage.|$|E
25|$|Some {{micropower}} analog circuits {{are designed}} {{to take advantage of}} <b>subthreshold</b> conduction. By working in the weak-inversion region, the MOSFETs in these circuits deliver the highest possible transconductance-to-current ratio, namely: , almost that of a bipolar transistor.|$|E
25|$|The <b>subthreshold</b> I–V curve depends {{exponentially}} upon threshold voltage, {{introducing a}} strong dependence on any manufacturing variation that affects threshold voltage; for example: variations in oxide thickness, junction depth, or body doping {{that change the}} degree of drain-induced barrier lowering. The resulting sensitivity to fabricational variations complicates optimization for leakage and performance.|$|E
25|$|A mood {{disorder}} (affective) spectrum or bipolar spectrum or depressive spectrum. These {{approaches have}} expanded out in different directions. On the one hand, work on {{major depressive disorder}} has identified a spectrum of subcategories and <b>subthreshold</b> symptoms which are prevalent, recurrent and associated with treatment needs. People are found to move between the subtypes and the main diagnostic type over time, suggesting a spectrum. This spectrum can include already recognised categories of minor depressive disorder, 'melancholic depression' and various kinds of atypical depression.|$|E
25|$|Although neural {{oscillations}} {{in human}} brain activity are mostly investigated using EEG recordings, {{they are also}} observed using more invasive recording techniques such as single-unit recordings. Neurons can generate rhythmic patterns of action potentials or spikes. Some types of neurons have the tendency to fire at particular frequencies, so-called resonators. Bursting is another form of rhythmic spiking. Spiking patterns are considered fundamental for information coding in the brain. Oscillatory activity can also be observed {{in the form of}} <b>subthreshold</b> membrane potential oscillations (i.e. in the absence of action potentials). If numerous neurons spike in synchrony, they can give rise to oscillations in local field potentials. Quantitative models can estimate the strength of neural oscillations in recorded data.|$|E
25|$|At larger {{gate bias}} still, near the {{semiconductor}} surface the conduction band edge is brought {{close to the}} Fermi level, populating the surface with electrons in an inversion layer or n-channel at the interface between the p region and the oxide. This conducting channel extends between the source and the drain, and current is conducted through it when a voltage is applied between the two electrodes. Increasing the voltage on the gate leads to a higher electron density in the inversion layer and therefore increases the current flow between the source and drain. For gate voltages below the threshold value, the channel is lightly populated, and {{only a very small}} <b>subthreshold</b> leakage current can flow between the source and the drain.|$|E
25|$|Scientists have {{identified}} some intrinsic neuronal properties that {{play an important}} role in generating membrane potential oscillations. In particular, voltage-gated ion channels are critical in the generation of action potentials. The dynamics of these ion channels have been captured in the well-established Hodgkin–Huxley model that describes how action potentials are initiated and propagated by means of a set of differential equations. Using bifurcation analysis, different oscillatory varieties of these neuronal models can be determined, allowing for the classification of types of neuronal responses. The oscillatory dynamics of neuronal spiking as identified in the Hodgkin–Huxley model closely agree with empirical findings. In addition to periodic spiking, <b>subthreshold</b> membrane potential oscillations, i.e. resonance behavior that does not result in action potentials, may also contribute to oscillatory activity by facilitating synchronous activity of neighboring neurons. Like pacemaker neurons in central pattern generators, subtypes of cortical cells fire bursts of spikes (brief clusters of spikes) rhythmically at preferred frequencies. Bursting neurons have the potential to serve as pacemakers for synchronous network oscillations, and bursts of spikes may underlie or enhance neuronal resonance.|$|E
25|$|When a {{negative}} gate-source voltage (positive source-gate) is applied, {{it creates a}} p-channel at {{the surface of the}} n region, analogous to the n-channel case, but with opposite polarities of charges and voltages. When a voltage less negative than the threshold value ({{a negative}} voltage for the p-channel) is applied between gate and source, the channel disappears and only a very small <b>subthreshold</b> current can flow between the source and the drain. The device may comprise a silicon on insulator (SOI) device in which a buried oxide (BOX) is formed below a thin semiconductor layer. If the channel region between the gate dielectric and a BOX region is very thin, the channel is referred to as an ultrathin channel (UTC) region with the source and drain regions formed on either side thereof in and/or above the thin semiconductor layer. Alternatively, the device may comprise a semiconductor on insulator (SEMOI) device in which semiconductors other than silicon are employed. Many alternative semiconductor materials may be employed. When the source and drain regions are formed above the channel in whole or in part, they are referred to as raised source/drain (RSD) regions.|$|E
500|$|Because of its {{densely packed}} neural layers, {{of all the}} brain {{structures}} which generate the hippocampal theta rhythm, the hippocampus generates {{some of the largest}} EEG signals as theta waves [...] In some situations the EEG is dominated by regular waves at 3 to 10Hz, often continuing for many seconds. [...] These reflect <b>subthreshold</b> membrane potentials and strongly modulate the spiking of hippocampal neurons and synchronise across the hippocampus in a travelling wave pattern. The trisynaptic circuit is a relay of neurotransmission in the hippocampus that interacts with many brain regions. From rodent studies it has been proposed that the trisynaptic circuit generates the hippocampal theta rhythm.|$|E
2500|$|Shunting is {{a process}} in which axonal ion {{channels}} open during the passive flow (not requiring an ion pump) of a <b>subthreshold</b> depolarization down the axon. [...] Usually occurring at axonal branch points, the timing of these channels opening as the <b>subthreshold</b> signal arrives in the area causes a hyperpolarization to be introduced to the passively flowing depolarization. [...] Therefore, the cell is able to control which branches of the axon the <b>subthreshold</b> depolarization current flows through, resulting in some branches of the axon being more hyperpolarized than others. [...] These differing membrane potentials cause certain areas of the neuron to be more excitable than others, based on the specific location and occurrence of shunting.|$|E
2500|$|Higher <b>subthreshold</b> conduction: As MOSFET {{geometries}} shrink, {{the voltage}} {{that can be}} applied to the gate must be reduced to maintain reliability. To maintain performance, the threshold voltage of the MOSFET has to be reduced as well. As threshold voltage is reduced, the transistor cannot be switched from complete turn-off to complete turn-on with the limited voltage swing available; the circuit design is a compromise between strong current in the [...] "on" [...] case and low current in the [...] "off" [...] case, and the application determines whether to favor one over the other. <b>Subthreshold</b> leakage (including <b>subthreshold</b> conduction, gate-oxide leakage and reverse-biased junction leakage), which was ignored in the past, now can consume upwards of half of the total power consumption of modern high-performance VLSI chips.|$|E

Use of CBT was found to significantly reduce social anxiety prevalence.|$|E
2500|$|Nonsynaptic {{plasticity}} {{is a form}} of neuroplasticity {{that involves}} modification of ion channel function in the axon, dendrites, and cell body that results in specific changes in the integration of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). Nonsynaptic plasticity is a modification of the intrinsic excitability of the neuron. [...] It interacts with synaptic plasticity, but it is considered a separate entity from synaptic plasticity. [...] Intrinsic modification of the electrical properties of neurons plays a role in many aspects of plasticity from homeostatic plasticity to learning and memory itself. [...] Nonsynaptic plasticity affects synaptic integration, <b>subthreshold</b> propagation, spike generation, and other fundamental mechanisms of neurons at the cellular level. [...] These individual neuronal alterations can result in changes in higher brain function, especially learning and memory. [...] However, as an emerging field in neuroscience, much of the knowledge about nonsynaptic plasticity is uncertain and still requires further investigation to better define its role in brain function and behavior.|$|E
2500|$|Increased gate-oxide leakage: The gate oxide, {{which serves}} as {{insulator}} between the gate and channel, should be made as thin as possible to increase the channel conductivity and performance when the transistor is on and to reduce <b>subthreshold</b> leakage when the transistor is off. However, with current gate oxides with a thickness of around 1.2nm (which in silicon is ~5atoms thick) the quantum mechanical phenomenon of electron tunneling occurs between the gate and channel, leading to increased power consumption. Silicon dioxide has traditionally been used as the gate insulator. [...] Silicon dioxide however has a modest dielectric constant. Increasing the dielectric constant of the gate dielectric allows a thicker layer while maintaining a high capacitance (capacitance is proportional to dielectric constant and inversely proportional to dielectric thickness). All else equal, a higher dielectric thickness reduces the quantum tunneling current through the dielectric between the gate and the channel. Insulators that have a larger dielectric constant than silicon dioxide (referred to as high-κ dielectrics), such as group IVb metal silicates e.g. hafnium and zirconium silicates and oxides {{are being used to}} reduce the gate leakage from the 45 nanometer technology node onwards. On the other hand, the barrier height of the new gate insulator is an important consideration; the difference in conduction band energy between the semiconductor and the dielectric (and the corresponding difference in valence band energy) also affects leakage current level. For the traditional gate oxide, silicon dioxide, the former barrier is approximately 8 eV. For many alternative dielectrics the value is significantly lower, tending to increase the tunneling current, somewhat negating the advantage of higher dielectric constant. The maximum gate-source voltage is determined by the strength of the electric field able to be sustained by the gate dielectric before significant leakage occurs. As the insulating dielectric is made thinner, the electric field strength within it goes up for a fixed voltage. This necessitates using lower voltages with the thinner dielectric.|$|E

50|$|The <b>subthreshold</b> swing is {{proportional}} to the transistor speed: The lower the <b>subthreshold</b> swing, the faster a transistor will be able to charge its fan-out (consecutive capacitive load). For a given transistor speed and a maximum acceptable <b>subthreshold</b> leakage, the <b>subthreshold</b> slope thus defines a certain minimal threshold voltage. Reducing the threshold voltage is an essential part for the idea of constant field scaling. Since 2003, the major technology developers got almost stuck in threshold voltage scaling and thus could also not scale supply voltage (which due to technical reasons has to be at least 3 times the threshold voltage for high performance devices). As a consequence, the processor speed did not develop as fast as before 2003 (see Beyond CMOS). The advent of a mass-producible TFET device with a slope far below 63 mV/decade will enable the industry to continue the scaling trends from the 1990s, where processor frequency doubled each 3 years.|$|E

50|$|The {{reason for}} a growing {{importance}} of <b>subthreshold</b> conduction is that the supply voltage has continually scaled down, both to reduce the dynamic power consumption of integrated circuits (the power that is consumed when the transistor is switching from an on-state to an off-state, which depends on {{the square of the}} supply voltage), and to keep electric fields inside small devices low, to maintain device reliability. The amount of <b>subthreshold</b> conduction is set by the threshold voltage, which sits between ground and the supply voltage, and so has to be reduced along with the supply voltage.
