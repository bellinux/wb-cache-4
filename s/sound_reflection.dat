50|$|In 1975, the {{scientific}} side of SACLANTCEN was reorganised into two main divisions: the Environmental and Systems Research Division and the Operational and Analytical Research Division. After {{more than a}} decade mostly dedicated to deep waters, shallow waters became a new priority as submarine activity in those areas was increasing and submarines were becoming quieter and available to more nations.

30|$|It is {{commonly}} accepted that the <b>sound</b> <b>reflections</b> from real physical objects {{are much more}} complicated than what usually is and can be modelled by room acoustics modelling software. The main reason for this limitation is the level of detail inherent in the physical object in terms of its geometrical and acoustic properties. In the present paper, the complexity of the <b>sound</b> <b>reflections</b> from a corridor wall is investigated by modelling the corresponding acoustic transfer functions at several receiver positions in front of the wall. The complexity for different wall configurations has been examined and the changes have been achieved by altering its acoustic image. The results show that for a homogenous flat wall, the complexity is significant and for a wall including various smaller objects, the complexity is highly dependent on the position of the receiver with respect to the objects.|$|R

50|$|Targets do {{not reflect}} the sound omni-directionally. The {{mechanism}} of <b>sound</b> <b>reflection</b> (or scattering by the target) is complicated, because the target is not just a rigid sphere. Scattered sound level depends on the angle β from which the target is ensonified by the projector, and it also varies with angle scattering direction α (refer to local target axes Z{x,y}). These angles are often referred to as aspects. This scattered sound level vs (α, β) function is called the scattering pattern S(α, β). Direction of maximum echo (maximum of S(α, β)) also depends on target shape and inner structure. So sometimes the best ensonifying aspect {{is not the same as}} the best receive aspect.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{a model for}} <b>sound</b> <b>reflections</b> {{designed}} {{which is to be}} used in an audio-based game for visually impaired people is described. This project is a part of a three-group bachelor graduation project of six peoplein total. The three groups combined create a working game for visually impaired children, meant to be used to train the user’s ears and brain to visualize their surroundings using sound only. Using the mirror source method, a model for <b>sound</b> <b>reflections</b> in concave 3 D rooms is obtained. Important parts of this model are the placement of the mirror sources, the calculation of a line of sight and a model for the energy absorption of a wall when sound is reflected off of it. The placement of mirror sources and a model for the wall absorption were successfully implemented. The calculation of a line of sight is only half finished. The implementation of the model in the game adds a sense of the location and the materials of the walls. The execution time of the model is however too low to run the model completely in real time.

5000|$|Echolocation calls {{have been}} {{measured}} at intensities anywhere between 60 and 140 decibels. Certain microbat species can modify their call intensity mid-call, lowering the intensity {{as they approach}} objects that reflect sound strongly. This prevents the returning echo from deafening the bat. High-intensity calls such as those from aerial-hawking bats (133 dB) are adaptive to hunting in open skies. Their high intensity calls are necessary to even have moderate detection of surroundings because air has a high absorption of ultrasound and because insects’ size only provide a small target for <b>sound</b> <b>reflection.</b> Additionally, the so-called [...] "whispering bats" [...] have adapted low-amplitude echolocation so that their prey, moths, which are able to hear echolocation calls, are less able to detect and avoid an oncoming bat.|$|E

5000|$|Geometrical {{acoustics}} or ray acoustics is {{a branch}} of acoustics that studies propagation of sound {{on the basis of}} the concept of rays considered as lines along which the acoustic energy is transported. This concept is similar to the concept of geometrical optics, or ray optics, that studies light propagation in terms of rays. Geometrical acoustics is the approximate theory, which is valid in the limiting case of very small acoustic wavelengths, or very high frequencies. The principal task of geometrical acoustics is to determine the trajectories of sound rays. The rays have the simplest form in a homogeneous medium, where they are straight lines. If the acoustic parameters of the medium are functions of spatial coordinates, the ray trajectories become curvilinear, describing <b>sound</b> <b>reflection,</b> refraction, possible focusing, etc. The equations of geometric acoustics have essentially the same form as those of geometric optics. The same laws of reflection and refraction hold for sound rays as for light rays. Geometrical acoustics does not take into account such important wave effects as diffraction. However, it provides a very good approximation when the wavelength is very small compared to the characteristic dimensions of inhomogeneous inclusions through which the sound propagates.|$|E

50|$|Owls exhibit {{specialized}} hearing {{functions and}} ear shapes that also aid in hunting. They are noted for asymmetrical ear placements on the skull in some genera. Owls can have either {{internal or external}} ears, {{both of which are}} asymmetrical. Asymmetry has not been reported to extend to the middle or internal ear of the owl. Asymmetrical ear placement on the skull allows the owl to pinpoint the location of its prey. This is especially true for strictly nocturnal species such as the barn owls Tyto or Tengmalm's owl. With ears set at different places on its skull, an owl is able to determine the direction from which the sound is coming by the minute difference in time that it takes for the sound waves to penetrate the left and right ears. The owl turns its head until the sound reaches both ears at the same time, at which point it is directly facing the source of the sound. This time difference between ears is a matter of about 0.00003 seconds, or 30 millionths of a second. Behind the ear openings are modified, dense feathers, densely packed to form a facial ruff, which creates an anterior-facing, concave wall that cups the sound into the ear structure. This facial ruff is poorly defined in some species, and prominent, nearly encircling the face, in other species. The facial disk also acts to direct sound into the ears, and a downward-facing, sharply triangular beak minimizes <b>sound</b> <b>reflection</b> away from the face. The shape of the facial disk is adjustable at will to focus sounds more effectively.|$|E
