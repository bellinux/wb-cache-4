40|$|The {{volume effect}} in the {{reaction}} between Zn-doped solders and Cu is reported and explained in this article. Zn-doped solders with two different volumes, bulk <b>solder</b> <b>baths</b> (6 g) and small solder balls (10 mg), were reacted with Cu substrates. It {{was found that the}} reaction at the interface depended not only on the Zn concentration but also on the volume of the solder. For the bulk solder reaction the Zn concentration stayed nearly constant, whereas in the small solder joint case the Zn concentration changed substantially with the reaction time. This was because the Zn concentration during reaction was different for different solder volumes when the volume effect became impor-tant. For bulk <b>solder</b> <b>baths,</b> when the Zn content was 0. 5 wt. %, the reaction product was a Cu 6 Sn 5 -based compound. As the Zn content increased to 2 wt. %, the reaction product switched to a Cu 5 Zn 8 -based compound. When the Zn content was 1. 0 wt. %, Cu 6 Sn 5 and CuZn formed simultaneously. When the solder volume became smaller, the Zn concentration was no longer constant, and the phase equilibrium at the interface changed with time. It was shown that the shifting of the equilibrium at the interface caused the massive spalling of CuZn. Key words: Soldering, diffusion, intermetallic...|$|R
50|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that lead free soldering requires higher soldering temperatures than lead/tin solder; the wetting temperature in lead/tin solder {{is higher than the}} melting point and is the controlling factor - Wave soldering can proceed at the same temperature as previous lead/tin soldering. Nevertheless, many new technical challenges have arisen with this endeavor; to reduce the melting point of tin-based solder alloys various new alloys have had to be researched, with additives of copper, silver, bismuth as typical minor additives to reduce melting point and control other properties, additionally tin is a more corrosive metal, and can eventually lead to the failure of <b>solder</b> <b>baths</b> etc.|$|R

50|$|Ultrasonic {{soldering}} uses either ultrasonically coupled heated solder iron tips (0.5 - 10 mm) or ultrasonically coupled <b>solder</b> <b>baths</b> {{as mentioned}} above. In these devices, piezoelectric crystals {{are used to}} generate high frequency (20 - 60 kHz) acoustic waves in molten solder layers or batch, to mechanically disrupt oxides that form on the molten solder surfaces. The tips for U/S soldering irons are also coupled to a heating element while the piezoelectric crystal is thermally isolated, not to degrade the piezoelectric element. Ultrasonic soldering iron tips can heat (up to 450 °C) while mechanically oscillating at 20 - 60 kHz. This soldering tip can melt solder filler metals as acoustic vibrations are induced in the molten solder pool. The vibration and cavitation in the molten solder then permits solders to wet and adhere to many metal surfaces.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Industry should {{gradually}} {{replace the}} tin-lead solder alloys used traditionally {{in the soft}} soldering technology by lead-free soldering alloys, which raises {{a lot of new}} technological and scientific problems to be solved. The introduction and application of lead-free alloys caused a number of soldering defects not observed earlier; mechanisms of their formation are still unclear. One of such defects is whisker formation, another one is intensified formation of intermetallic phases. The appearance of undesired intermetallic phases in the soldering material spoils its mechanical properties; therefore it is particularly important that these phases do not form in electronic components. Besides, the formation of intermetallic compounds may occur in the <b>soldering</b> <b>bath,</b> thus making the soldering process difficult or even impossible. Tin-copper-nickel and tin-silver-copper alloys are suitable for the replacement of tin-lead alloys. The components of these alloys were studied. After metallographic examination of the specimens the occurrence of intermetallic phases was determined by the XRD method. The identification of intermetallic phases was carried out by using literature data and phase diagrams...|$|R

The oxide disruption and removal involves cavitation effects between the molten solder and the base metal surface. A common application of ultrasound fluxing is in tinning of passive parts (active parts do not cope well with the mechanical stresses involved); even aluminium can be tinned this way. The parts can then be soldered or brazed conventionally.|$|E
50|$|Solder mask or solder stop mask or {{solder resist}} {{is a thin}} lacquer-like layer of polymer that is usually applied to the copper traces of {{a printed circuit board}} (PCB) for {{protection}} against oxidation and to prevent solder bridges from forming between closely spaced solder pads. A solder bridge is an unintended electrical connection between two conductors by means of a small blob of solder. PCBs use solder masks to prevent this from happening. Solder mask is not always used for hand soldered assemblies, but is essential for mass-produced boards that are soldered automatically using reflow or <b>solder</b> <b>bath</b> techniques. Once applied, openings must be made in the solder mask wherever components are soldered, which is accomplished using photolithography. Solder mask is traditionally green but is now available in many colors.|$|E
50|$|Dip {{soldering}} {{is accomplished}} by submerging parts to be joined into a molten <b>solder</b> <b>bath.</b> Thus, all components surfaces are coated with filler metal. Solders have low surface tension and high wetting capability. There are many types of solders, each used for different applications. Such as Lead-Silver for strength at higher than room temperature. Tin-Lead is used for General Purpose; Tin-Zinc is used for Aluminum; Cadmium-Silver is used for strength at high temperatures; Zinc-Aluminum is used for Aluminum and corrosion resistance; Tin-Silver and Tin-Bismuth is used for Electronics. Because of the toxicity of lead, lead-free solders are being developed and more widely used. The molten bath can be any suitable filler metal, but the selection is usually confined to the lower melting point elements. The most common dip soldering operations use zinc-aluminum and tin-lead solders.Solder pot metal - Cast iron or steel,electrically heated.Bath temperature - 220 deg.

40|$|There are {{two sources}} of {{contamination}} in solder alloys. The first source is trace elements {{from the primary}} metals used in the as-manufactured product, be that product in ingot, wire, or powder form. Their levels in the primary metal {{are determined by the}} refining process. While some of these trace elements are naturally occurring materials, additional contamination can result from the refining and/or forming processes. Sources include: furnace pot liners, debris on the cutting edges of shears, rolling mill rollers, etc. The types and levels of contaminants per solder alloy are set by recognized industrial, federal, military, and international specifications. For example, the 63 Sn- 37 Pb solder purchased to the ASTM B 32 standard can have maximum levels of contamination for the following metals: 0. 08 (wt.) %Cu, 0. 001 %Cd, 0. 005 %Al, 0. 25 %Bi, 0. 03 %As, 0. 02 %Fe, and 0. 005 %Zn. A second cause of contamination in <b>solders,</b> and <b>solder</b> <b>baths</b> in particular, is their actual use in soldering operations. Each time a workpiece is introduced into the bath, some dissolution of the joint base metal(s), protective or solderable coatings, and fixture metal takes place which adds to contamination levels in the solder.

Many solders such as SnCu, SnAg, SnAgCu, SnZn, SnBi have already been proposed as the replacement {{but none of them}} has reached the physical and metallurgical properties similar to the SnPb solder. However, wetting is one of the basic problems that make the lead-free solder inferior as compared to the SnPb solder.

This paper describes the comparative wetting behavior of Sn- 0. 7 Cu and Sn- 0. 7 Cu- 0. 3 Ni solders on Cu and Ni substrates. Wetting balance tests were performed to assess the wetting behaviors. Three different commercial fluxes namely no-clean (NC), non-activated (R) and water soluble organic acid (WS) fluxes were used to assess the wettability for three <b>solder</b> <b>bath</b> temperatures.

40|$|Both the {{experimental}} and the modelling techniques {{have been investigated}} and used to investigate factors that influence the formation, quality and reliability of electronic packaging interconnections formed using solder alloys and anisotropic conductive films (ACFs). The wetting behaviours of new lead-free solders (i. e. Sn- 2. 8 Ag- 0. 5 Cu- 1. 0 Bi and Sn- 0. 7 Cu- 0. 3 Ni) have been evaluated using the wetting balance test. This assessment ahs been performed for three soldering temperatures with three different types of fluxes. The results have been compared with the conventional Sn-Pb, Sn-Ag-Cu and Sn-Cu solders. It {{has been found that}} the wettability of the lead-free solders is not as good as that of the Sn-Pb solder. The additions of Bi into the Sn-Ag-Cu solder and Ni into the Sn-Cu solder improve the wettability that is strongly dependent on the type of the flux and the soldering temperature. In general, NC-flux is suitable for Cu-substrate whereas Ws-flux is suitable for Ni substrate, but for the Sn- 2. 8 Ag- 0. 5 -Cu solder on Ni substrate, good wettability has been observed with both the NC and the R-type fluxes. Computational modelling of this test has revealed that the increase in the depth and the radius of the <b>solder</b> <b>bath</b> has little effect on the wetting force, but the meniscus height decreases when the bath radius exceeds 14 mm. Dissolution of solid metals into liquid solders has been investigated through experiments and computer modelling. Microstructural studies have been carried out and the growth behaviours of the intermetallic compounds (IMCs) during wetting, solidification and isothermal ageing have been investigated. It has been found that the addition of Bi into the Sn-Ag-Cu solder reduces the consumptions of the substrates and suppresses the growth of IMCs during wetting and ageing. Similarly, the addition of Ni into the Sn-Cu solder reduces both the consumptions of the substrates and the growth of IMCs during wetting and short term ageing but enhances the growth of IMCs during long term ageing. Experimental and computer modelling techniques have been used to measure the temperature in the ACF during bonding. The temperature in an ACF joint becomes very close to the required maximum bonding temperature within the first 1 s of bonding time. The impact of this temperature on the cure process and on the ACF physical properties such as loss modulus, storage modulus, and glass transition temperature has been investigated. It has been found that the higher the bonding temperature the more the curing degree of ACF is. Rapid changes occur in the physical properties of ACF at temperatures above the glass transition point. When the ACF is cured for a long time at a high temperature, the physical properties may degrade. The adhesion strength of ACF joint increases as the curing degree increases. However, when the ACF joint undergoes a thermal aging treatment, the adhesion strength increases for the samples bonded at lower temperatures, but decreases for the samples bonded at higher temperatures. The rate of increase in the contact resistance is dramatically higher for the samples bonded at lower temperatures than for those bonded at higher temperatures. Computer modelling of the isothermal ageing of ACF joint confirms that the thermal load causes the expansion of the adhesive matrix and generates high stresses on the conductive particle. This may result in the permanent damage of the outermost conductive metallic layers as well as electrical failure. The effect of external bending loads on the electrical reliability of ACF-based interconnection has also been studied through computer modelling. The analysis reveals that ACF thickness increases at the corners of the chip-ACF joint more than that of the middle position. This causes a gap between the chip and the substrate results in the failure of the electrical interconnections. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
