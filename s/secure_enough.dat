5|$|Matilda {{remained}} in England until 1148. The disorders {{were at their}} peak between 1142 and 1148, but her cause could never <b>secure</b> <b>enough</b> support to enable her to be crowned. Nor could Stephen decisively defeat Matilda's forces, which meant that England remained divided in allegiance between the two rivals. But while Matilda was in England, her husband Geoffrey was conquering Normandy, which he finally overran in 1144.|$|E
5|$|Upon release, Space Station Silicon Valley was {{acclaimed}} by many reviewers, with praise particularly {{directed at}} the intuitive mechanics, innovative level design, and comical concepts.

5|$|By 1210, Michael was <b>secure</b> <b>enough</b> {{to launch}} an attack against the Latin Kingdom of Thessalonica, in {{conjunction}} with the Bulgarians. Repelled by the intervention of the Latin Emperor Henry of Flanders, Michael quickly switched sides and joined the Latins to prevent the city from falling into Bulgarian hands. In 1212, he conquered most of Thessaly from the Lombard lords of Thessalonica. At about the same time, his troops briefly took over the Lordship of Salona. He then went on to recover Dyrrhachium and the island of Corfu from the Venetians in 1213–14, but was thwarted in his attempt to push further north into Zeta. He was assassinated soon after in his sleep, and was succeeded by his half-brother Theodore Komnenos Doukas.|$|E

5|$|By late 1461, risings in {{the north}} had been put down, and {{in the summer of}} 1462, Warwick {{negotiated}} a truce with Scotland. In October the same year, Margaret of Anjou invaded England with troops from France, and managed to take the castles of Alnwick and Bamburgh. Warwick had to organise the recapture of the castles, which was accomplished by January 1463. The leaders of the rebellion, including Sir Ralph Percy, were pardoned and left in charge of the retaken castles. At this point, Warwick felt <b>secure</b> <b>enough</b> to travel south; in February he buried the remains of his father and brother at Bisham Priory, and in March he attended parliament at Westminster.|$|E
5|$|Pistrucci's early clients {{included}} two of Rome's major art dealers, Ignazio Vescovali and Angelo Bonelli, and Napoleon's three sisters, Elisa, Pauline and Caroline. Pistrucci gained prominence by winning a competition {{to make a}} cameo of Elisa (the Grand Duchess of Tuscany), working nearly nonstop for eight days to complete it. The Grand Duchess was so impressed by his work that she gave him studio space at her palace. Pistrucci felt <b>secure</b> <b>enough</b> with this patronage that in 1802, he married Barbara Folchi, daughter of a well-to-do merchant; they had nine children together. He continued working in Rome, turning out portrait cameos and engraved gems, until 1814.|$|E
5|$|The South Stand of the rugby ground {{formed a}} {{complete}} unit with the North Stand of the National Stadium. Now the same {{structure of the}} South Stand of the rugby ground is also physically attached to the North Stand of the Millennium Stadium. This section is known colloquially as Glanmor's Gap, after Glanmor Griffiths, former chair and President of the WRU. This came about because the WRU were unable to <b>secure</b> <b>enough</b> funding to include the North Stand in the Millennium Stadium, and the National Lottery Commission would not provide any additional funds {{to be used for}} the construction of a new ground for Cardiff RFC. The Millennium Stadium was therefore built with the old reinforced concrete structure of the National Stadium (North Stand) and the new steel Millennium Stadium structure built around it.|$|E

5|$|Throughout his life, Władysław {{successfully}} defended Poland {{against foreign}} invasions. He {{was recognized as}} a good tactician and strategist, who did much to modernize the Polish Army. Władysław ensured that the officer corps was significantly large so that the army could be expanded; introduced foreign (Western) infantry to the Polish Army, with its pikes and early firearms, and supported {{the expansion of the}} artillery. His attempt to create a Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth Navy resulted {{in the creation of a}} new port village, Władysławowo. Despite promising beginnings, Władysław failed to <b>secure</b> <b>enough</b> funds for the fleet creation; the ships were gone – sunk, or stolen – by the 1640s.|$|E
5|$|In 1829, Crittenden {{was elected}} to the Kentucky House via a special election. He served as Speaker of the House for his entire term. In 1830, he was the Whig nominee to replace John Rowan in the Senate. Secretly, the party wished to {{nominate}} Henry Clay, giving him a springboard from which to launch another presidential campaign, but it was unknown whether {{he would be able to}} <b>secure</b> <b>enough</b> votes for confirmation; it was decided that Crittenden would be the nominee, and if the voting favored the Whigs by a large enough margin, Crittenden would withdraw and allow them to confirm Clay instead. The Democrats countered successively with Richard Mentor Johnson, John Rowan, Charles A. Wickliffe, and John Breathitt. None of them polled more than sixty-four of the sixty-nine votes needed for confirmation. Crittenden garnered sixty-eight votes on fourteen different ballots, but he refused to vote for himself because he wanted Clay to be the nominee. Some of Crittenden's supporters, however, refused to vote for Clay, and the seat was left vacant.|$|E
5|$|The stadium was {{slightly}} restricted in size {{due to its}} proximity to Cardiff Rugby Club's home in the adjacent smaller stadium within Cardiff Arms Park. The WRU were unable to <b>secure</b> <b>enough</b> funding to include the North Stand in the new stadium, and the Millennium Commission would not allow any of its funds {{to be used in}} any way {{for the construction of a}} new stadium for Cardiff RFC. The WRU held talks with Cardiff RFC to see if it would be possible for the club to either move or secure funding for the Cardiff Arms Park to be re-developed, but these were unsuccessful. The stadium thus had to be completed with a break in its bowl structure in the North Stand, known colloquially as the Cardiff fault or Glanmor's Gap, after Glanmor Griffiths, then chairman of the WRU and now a former president.|$|E

5|$|Thereafter, the {{archipelago}} was visited only by fishing ships; its political status was undisputed until 1820, when Colonel David Jewett, an American privateer {{working for the}} United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, informed anchored ships about Buenos Aires' 1816 claim to Spain's territories in the South Atlantic. Since the islands had no permanent inhabitants, in 1823 Buenos Aires granted German-born merchant Luis Vernet permission to conduct fishing activities and exploit feral cattle in {{the archipelago}}. Vernet settled at the ruins of Puerto Soledad in 1826, and accumulated resources on the islands until the venture was <b>secure</b> <b>enough</b> to bring settlers and form a permanent colony. Buenos Aires named Vernet military and civil commander of the islands in 1829, and he attempted to regulate sealing to stop the activities of foreign whalers and sealers. Vernet's venture lasted until a dispute over fishing and hunting rights led to a raid by the American warship USS Lexington in 1831, when United States Navy commander Silas Duncan declared {{the dissolution of the}} island's government.|$|E
5|$|Though Sanford {{enjoyed his}} time as Duke's president, he still harbored {{political}} ambitions. As the 1972 presidential primary season began, he was approached by several people who felt that the field of Democratic candidates was weak. He was particularly keen to challenge Alabama governor George Wallace {{in an effort to}} show that Wallace's segregationist views did not represent majority Southern opinion. Announcing his candidacy on March 8, he faced long odds in a crowded field. Knowing that he could not win a majority of delegates in the primary, he hoped to <b>secure</b> <b>enough</b> to emerge as a compromise candidate in a deadlocked convention. Even in the North Carolina primary, however, Wallace beat Sanford by 100,000 votes, and Sanford managed only a fifth-place finish at the 1972 Democratic National Convention with 77.5 votes, behind George McGovern (1,864.95), Henry M. Jackson (525), Wallace (381.7), and Shirley Chisholm (151.95).|$|E
5|$|Zahir {{successfully}} withstood assaults and sieges by the Ottoman {{governors of}} the Sidon and Damascus provinces, {{who attempted to}} limit or eliminate his influence. He was often supported in these confrontations by the rural Shia Muslim clans of Jabal Amil. In 1771, in alliance with Ali Bey al-Kabir of Egypt Eyalet and with backing from the Russian Empire, Zahir captured Sidon, while Ali Bey's forces conquered Damascus, both acts in open defiance of the Ottoman sultan. At {{the peak of his}} power in 1774, Zahir's autonomous sheikhdom extended from Beirut to Gaza and included the Jabal Amil and Jabal Ajlun regions. By then, however, Ali Bey had been killed, the Ottomans entered into a truce with the Russians, and the Sublime Porte felt <b>secure</b> <b>enough</b> to check Zahir's power. The Ottoman Navy attacked his Acre stronghold in the summer of 1775 and he was killed outside of its walls shortly after.|$|E

5|$|The Simpsons uses a {{floating}} timeline {{in which the}} characters do not physically age, and as such the show {{is assumed to be}} set in the current year. In several episodes, events have been linked to specific times, though sometimes this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Maggie is the youngest child of Marge and Homer, and sister to Bart and Lisa. When Marge became pregnant with Bart, she and Homer got married at a chapel in Las Vegas. To support his impending family, Homer all but demanded a job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, impressing its owner, Mr. Burns, with his aggressive submissiveness. When Marge became pregnant with Lisa, two years later, she and Homer bought their first house. Another six years later, Homer felt financially <b>secure</b> <b>enough</b> to finally quit his job at the Power Plant and take his dream job at Barney's Bowlarama. However, Marge became pregnant with Maggie, so Homer, once again unable to support his family, was forced to reapply for his old job. By the time Maggie was born, Homer had shown great signs of distress, but he managed to find motivation in the form of his newborn baby girl.|$|E
5|$|William {{remained}} in England after his coronation {{and tried to}} reconcile the native magnates. The remaining earls– Edwin (of Mercia), Morcar (of Northumbria), and Waltheof (of Northampton)– were confirmed in their lands and titles. Waltheof was married to William's niece Judith, daughter of Adelaide, and a marriage between Edwin and one of William's daughters was proposed. Edgar the Ætheling also {{appears to have been}} given lands. Ecclesiastical offices continued to be held by the same bishops as before the invasion, including the uncanonical Stigand. But the families of Harold and his brothers did lose their lands, as did some others who had fought against William at Hastings. By March, William was <b>secure</b> <b>enough</b> to return to Normandy, but he took with him Stigand, Morcar, Edwin, Edgar, and Waltheof. He left his half-brother Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux, in charge of England along with another influential supporter, William fitzOsbern, the son of his former guardian. Both men were also named to earldoms– fitzOsbern to Hereford (or Wessex) and Odo to Kent. Although he put two Normans in overall charge, he retained many of the native English sheriffs. Once in Normandy the new English king went to Rouen and the Abbey of Fecamp, and then attended the consecration of new churches at two Norman monasteries.|$|E
