Qiang’s traditional <b>settlements</b> are valuable cultural heritages. Unfortunately, most of Qiang’s <b>settlements</b> were damaged during Wenchuan earthquake in 2008 in different degree. After the earthquake, <b>settlements</b> were reconstructed in different ways. The landscape of Qiang’s <b>settlements</b> had been changed greatly by dual influences, the destruction of earthquake and reconstruction after earthquake. Researching the changing process of Qiang’s <b>settlements</b> landscape has great significance to the protection of cultural heritage and the inheritance of culture, especially in the period after earthquake. At first, Qiang’s <b>settlements</b> are classified into five types with typology method after field research, according to the different degree of destruction and the different model of reconstruction. The five types are <b>settlements</b> restored to original forms in original location, <b>settlements</b> rebuilt to traditional forms in original location, <b>settlements</b> transformed to traditional forms in original location, <b>settlements</b> rebuilt in new location according to unified planning and <b>settlements</b> rebuilt in new location by villagers themselves. Secondly, the five types of <b>settlements</b> are compared with traditional <b>settlements</b> from several aspects including geographical environment, location of <b>settlements,</b> forms of <b>settlements,</b> space structure, building materials and construction technology, in order to research for the change of the landscape characteristics. Finally, the changing processes of each type of <b>settlements</b> landscape are analyzed. The change of villagers’ demands for <b>settlements</b> space are analyzed with the changes of their production model, life style, traditional customs, cultural communication, national religion and spiritual pursuit. Based on this analysis, the main factors influencing the changes of Qiang’s <b>settlements</b> landscape are summarized...|$|R

The reasons for this are mainly the difficult conditions of life, the very limited number of social services and utilities, extreme low level of capital investment in infrastructure, the lack of prospects in the primary sector, the opportunity to migrate to <b>settlements</b> that lies in plains with plenty arable land and cities, and as well as migration abroad in order to ensure the welfare and long-term perspective for a family because of the state of frozen conflict-war in Kosovo during 1989 – 1999.

Results showed that: (1) Spatial evolution of human <b>settlements</b> presents triaxiality. Administrative divisions do not play a full and predominant role in the unit division of human <b>settlements.</b> The number of distribution districts (counties) within different units of human <b>settlements</b> tends to be balanced, there is spatial variation of tertiary units in the human <b>settlements</b> of Dalian, and the transition area of human <b>settlements</b> occupies the leading position in the unit division of human settlements; (2) Human <b>settlements</b> also exhibit triaxiality at different development stages during the period of evolution. The fluctuation changes of degrees of livability of the human <b>settlements</b> of Dalian within the past 10 years have been relatively stable, with a trend of small scale decline and obvious manifestations of stage differences; (3) The system attributive characters of human <b>settlements</b> presents triaxiality. There also exists differentiations of system and area in human <b>settlements</b> within the same unit; (4) Industrialization and urbanization have led to the collapse of part of the urban-rural dual structure, while the differentiation of ternary structure of the economic and social structure, and living environment and life style leads to the triaxiality of human <b>settlements...</b>|$|R
