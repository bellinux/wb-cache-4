40|$|Abstract:- Axial flow fan {{has been}} used for large amount of flow rate in air {{handling}} units of industrial application fields. The fan involves a <b>shrouding</b> <b>duct</b> as flow guidance for uniform flows. Pressure difference between before and ahead of rotating blades causes the flows movements. The case where the flow resistance such as a heat exchanger is located prior to the rotors is typical in-field model for several air conditioning systems. Main interest lies on the looking for an optimal position of axial fan in a circular duct. Experimental apparatus for fan performances and numerical research for detail analysis are adopted in this investigation in parallel. The optimal location of an axial fan is recognized by both no reverse flows and larger amount of flow rate in the down stream. All numerical data are validated by experimental measurements using a wind tunnel...|$|R
5000|$|While it {{retained}} the [...] "Bubble Window" [...] styling, it {{differed from the}} Italian model in that its headlamps were fixed separately {{to the sides of}} the bodywork and it carried the BMW badge below the windscreen. The car was also redesigned to take {{a modified version of the}} 250 cc four-stroke engine from the BMW R25/3 motorcycle and the front suspension was changed. The single-cylinder generated [...] at 5800 rpm. The crankcase and cylinder were made of cast iron, the cylinder head of aluminium. However, the head was rotated by 180° compared with the motorcycle engine. The twin-bearing crankshaft was also different in the Isetta power unit, being larger and featuring reinforced bearings. One of the reasons for this was the heavy Dynastart unit which combined the dynamo and self-starter. The fuel mixture was provided by a Bing sliding throttle side draft motorcycle carburetor. In addition to further changes of detail, the BMW engineers enlarged the sump for installation in the car and cooled the engine by means of a radial fan and <b>shrouded</b> <b>ducting.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{ducted fan}} is a {{propulsion}} arrangement whereby a mechanical fan, {{which is a}} type of propeller, is mounted within a cylindrical <b>shroud</b> or <b>duct.</b> The duct reduces losses in thrust from the tips of the props, and varying the cross-section of the duct allows the designer to advantageously affect the velocity and pressure of the airflow according to Bernoulli's Principle. Ducted fan propulsion is used in aircraft, airships, airboats, hovercraft and fan packs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{shrouded}} {{tidal turbine}} is an emerging tidal stream technology {{that has a}} turbine enclosed in a venturi shaped <b>shroud</b> or <b>duct</b> (ventuduct), producing a sub atmosphere of low pressure behind the turbine. The venturi shrouded turbine {{is not subject to}} the Betz limit and allows the turbine to operate at higher efficiencies than the turbine alone by increasing the volume of the flow over the turbine. Claimed improvements vary, from 1.15 to 4 times higher power output [...] than the same turbine minus the shroud. The Betz limit of 59.3% conversion efficiency for a turbine in an open flow still applies, but is applied to the much larger shroud cross-section rather than the small turbine cross-section.|$|R
25|$|Rotor-powered {{vehicles}} are wind-powered vehicles that use rotors—instead of sails—which {{may have a}} <b>shroud</b> around them (<b>ducted</b> fan) or constitute an unducted propeller, and which may adjust orientation to face the apparent wind. The rotor may be connected via a drive train to wheels or to a generator that provides electrical power to electric motors that drive the wheels. Other concepts use a {{vertical axis wind turbine}} with airfoils that rotate around a vertical axis.|$|R
5000|$|Tidal energy {{converters}} {{can have}} varying modes of operating and therefore varying power output. If the power coefficient {{of the device}} [...] "" [...] is known, the equation below {{can be used to}} determine the power output of the hydrodynamic subsystem of the machine. This available power cannot exceed that imposed by the Betz limit on the power coefficient, although this can be circumvented to some degree by placing a turbine in a <b>shroud</b> or <b>duct.</b> This works, in essence, by forcing water which would not have flowed through the turbine through the rotor disk. In these situations it is the frontal area of the duct, rather than the turbine, which is used in calculating the power coefficient and therefore the Betz limit still applies to the device as a whole.|$|R

40|$|As the {{suitable}} {{locations for}} large wind {{farms in the}} mainland are limited, wind energy generation in the urban environment is gaining interest. The Diffuser Augmented Wind Turbine (DAWT) is a promising concept where the turbine is embedded into an airfoil-shaped diffuser (also named <b>shroud</b> or <b>duct),</b> which has the function of increasing the mass flow across the rotor. Such device is designed to overcome the low wind speed present in urban locations. Noise regulations represent a limit to the installation of wind turbines in urban areas. To the author’s knowledge, the far-field noise generated by DAWTs has been investigated only by Hashem et al. [31], who reported noise increase up to 20 dB compared to unaugmented turbines. However, the noise generation mechanisms are not clear yet. Furthermore, only partial data [15] on the fluid-dynamic behaviour of DAWT when operating in yawed inflow conditions are present, with no information on the noise pattern. The current study investigates both the fluid-dynamic and acoustic fields for a ducted wind turbine using a computational approach. The commercial DonQi turbine is taken as reference. The fluid-dynamic flow field is computed using the Lattice-Boltzmann Method solver Exa PowerFLOW. The Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings (FW-H) analogy is employed to compute the far-field noise. Three cases are investigated: the ducted turbine at 0 deg and 7. 5 deg yaw angles and the unducted turbine at 0 deg yaw angle. The fluid-dynamic analysis reveals {{that the presence of}} the diffuser accelerates the flow in the tip region, resulting in a significant increase of the thrust and the power produced by the turbine. In correspondence, the tip vortices present a higher intensity. These vortices interact with the boundary layer of the diffuser and form long vortical structures convected beyond the diffuser trailing edge. The presence of a yaw angle creates a non-axisymmetrical velocity pattern at the rotor disk, resulting in a power drop of 10. 8 %. However, no stall on the blades is detected. Contrarily to the observations by Cresswell et al., a separation region is formed on the diffuser suction side. Regarding the far-field noise, the directivity pattern for the unducted turbine presents a zone of low noise above the rotor. The addition of a diffuser causes a noise increase by approximately 5 dB upwind and downwind and by up to 15 dB in the low noise region, resulting in a more uniform noise distribution. This effect is ascribed to the higher flow speed in the tip region and to the diffraction of acoustic waves by the diffuser. Increasing the yaw angle to 7. 5 ± is found not to have a relevant impact on the far-field noise...|$|R
40|$|Flow {{augmentation}} {{consists in}} modifying mass flow across the actuation plane of a rotor to enhance energy extraction or propulsive efficiency. The talk sketches {{the distinction between}} passive and active rotor augmentation strategies. Power coefficient trends are compared analytically while numerical results illustrate differences in flow topology. Rotors are stylized as actuator disks that exert homogeneous normal forces on the steady flow of inviscid fluids to highlight the distinctive features of each augmentation principle. Passive augmentation principles have been well documented because they guide the design of <b>ducted,</b> <b>shrouded</b> and diffuser-augmented wind turbines 1 - 6. These axisymmetric bodies decrease average static pressures on the rotor plane to increase mass flux and power coefficient. Rotor-body interactions are dominated by conservative forces 5, 7 : the bodies don’t exchange energy with the fluid but act as augmenting devices and affect global energy balance by changing rotor state. Virtual work arguments show that bodies exert streamwise forces 4, 6 that can be related with the power coefficient through the law of de Vries 1, 6. Active flow augmentation is a rather recent theoretical concept 8. Its simplest energy extraction embodiment consists of an upstream actuator that accelerates flow onto a downstream actuator. This augmentation strategy is coined as active because the upstream actuator injects (spends) energy into the flow for the downstream actuator to extract (produce) energy from a greater mass flux than if it were alone. The interaction mechanism depends on the action of non-conservative forces and actuators interact exclusively through changes in total flow enthalpy when they are sufficiently far apart. No pressure interactions occur in this asymptotic case and a closed solution exists together with an analytical power coefficient law. Parallels can be drawn with wake ingestion propeller setups 9 but no practical energy extraction realizations have been attempted yet. Passive and active flow augmentation concepts are different but we hope that parallels between them shed further light on the physics of energy extraction from ideal fluid flows. The communication concludes with a few reflections meant to trigger an open discussion about the implications and applicability of the discussed theories. Wind Energ...|$|R
