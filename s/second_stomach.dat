50|$|Bees produce honey by {{collecting}} nectar, a clear liquid consisting of nearly 80 percent water and complex sugars. The collecting bees store the nectar in a <b>second</b> <b>stomach</b> {{and return to}} the hive, where worker bees remove the nectar. The worker bees digest the raw nectar for about 30 minutes, using enzymes to break down the complex sugars into simpler ones. Raw honey is then spread in empty honeycomb cells to dry, reducing its water content to less than 20 percent. When nectar is being processed, honey bees create a draft through the hive by fanning with their wings. When the honey has dried, the honeycomb cells are sealed (capped) with wax to preserve it.|$|E

40|$|During the {{development}} of the ruminant stomach complex, pre- and postnatal growth and differentiation processes occur. As a result, a functional unit from the rumen, reticulum, omasum and abomasum is formed, which is a composite multi-chamber stomach. The high losses in the rearing of dairy cattle calves in Germany by diseases of the gastrointestinal tract emphasize the need and the medical interest in gaining additional knowledge on {{the development}} of the bovine stomach system. However, information on prenatal morphological development of the ruminant stomach is mainly available from literature that is more than 10 years old. The aim of this study was to contribute to the understanding of the embryology of the ruminant stomach. For this, an overview of current topical literature of the bovine stomach development was given. In addition to macroscopic and histological aspects, the molecular-biological mechanisms were illustrated. Moreover, for the first time, a morphological study on {{the development of}} bovine fetuses was performed and complemented by the use of computer assisted tomography, the latter of, which should be the basis of teaching in embryology. The investigation of the bovine stomach system was based on whole-body CT scans of 30 fetuses of German Holstein (16 female and 14 male), which were obtained from a slaughterhouse, with a crown-rump length of 9. 5 cm to 89 cm. Using appropriate software, the three stomach compartments (ruminoreticulum, omasum and abomasum) were first analyzed for their relative and absolute volume development and their in situ position in craniocaudal extension. As an example, three fetuses of different ages were prepared topographically to validate the CT examinations. In the evaluation from the 3 rd to the beginning of the 9 th month of pregnancy the stomach compartments show a chronological growth progress with some characteristics: - From the 3 rd (55 % of the total volume) to the 5 th (70 % of total volume) month of pregnancy, the ruminoreticulum is the largest chamber. At the same time, the abomasum provides the smallest stomach compartment with 21 % (3 rd month) and 11 % of total volume (5 th month). - With the transition to the 6 th month of pregnancy, the proportions change. The abomasum increases in portion of the total volume up to the 9 th month on 55 % (the biggest stomach compartment). However, at the same time, the ruminoreticulum decreases up to 40 % of the total volume (<b>second</b> largest <b>stomach</b> compartment). / The relative volume development of ruminoreticulum and abomasum is inverse. - The omasum shows minor changes of its proportions. Up to the transition in the 6 th month of pregnancy, it is the <b>second</b> largest <b>stomach</b> compartment (19 % of total volume in the 5 th month), afterwards, the portion of the total volume decrease up to the 9 th month on 5 % (smallest stomach compartment). / In the last third of gestation, the omasum is already nearly completely developed. - Based on the factor of volume increase the largest absolute increase in volume happens in the transition from 3 rd to 4 th month of pregnancy (rumnioreticulum = 30, abomasum = 24, omasum = 20). However, at most, ruminoreticulum and abomasum increased fourfold in volume per month, the omasum only doubled in volume. - With the transition to the 6 th month of pregnancy, the abomasum again shows a growth peak (factor of increase in volume = 17). / This growth spurt could represent a critical phase, during which pathological processes can appear. - The ruminoreticulum is located in the left paramedian region and touched the left abdominal wall. It is the stomach chamber that is stretched most, which in the 4 th month of pregnancy reached its maximum length with more than 9. 5 vertebrae length. That corresponds to the relations in the adult cattle. - The omasum is usually located in the intrathoracic part of the abdomen and relatively constant in spherical form in the median region. It is the stomach chamber that is stretched least. - The location of the abomasum always has an intrathoracic part and is situated close to the right of the adjoining ruminoreticulum and touched the ventral abdominal wall. It is always the <b>second</b> longest <b>stomach</b> chamber, which shows neither a uniform shape nor a consistent position in the abdomen. / The change in position of the abomasum to the left abdominal wall in two fetuses in the last third of gestation corresponds the dislocatio abomasi sinistra. The results indicate a good applicability and reproducibility for measurement and 3 -D visualization of the fetal gastrointestinal system from CT image data. Based on the findings of this study, the present knowledge on the prenatal morphologic development of the ruminant stomach are supplement. However, further studies are needed to sufficiently answer the aspects that are still unclear...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of controlled release technology to oral drug delivery has had minimal success due to (1) the relatively short and variable gastrointestinal (GI) residence time and (2) {{the variability in}} the type and quantity of lumenal contents which can influence drug release rates. Enzyme-digestible hydrogels were synthesized as a gastric retention device to control gastric emptying for long-term oral drug delivery. The swelling, mechanical, and degradation properties of the hydrogel were controlled by varying the concentration of crosslinking agent (functionalized albumin, FA) in the monomer solution, the degree of modification on the FA, or the concentration of chemical initiator in the monomer solution. The incorporation of a model drug, flavin mononucleotide (FMN), into hydrogels of suitable size and integrity led to prolonged FMN levels in the blood for up to 54 h. Based on these findings, we synthesized new hydrogels using interpenetrating networks which were more suitable for human application. ^ Drug incorporation into hydrogels was studied using freeze drying and electrophoresis. The uniform incorporation of dextromethorphan hydrobromide into enzyme-digestible hydrogels was achieved by using the freeze drying process to remove water from swollen, drug-containing hydrogels. An electrophoretic apparatus was used to incorporate protein drugs into hydrogels. The {{application of}} current {{across the face of}} a hydrogel improved the loading efficiency by increasing the degree of protein incorporation in the gel and by reducing the loading time. ^ The use of hydrogels for the delivery oral vaccines to cattle was also studied. Hydrogels were used as a carrier to protect antigens against the harsh environment of the first stomach (rumen) in ruminants and to provide sustained release of antigens to the lymphoid tissue of the small intestine. Approximately 60 % of the administered hydrogels moved rapidly from the first stomach into the <b>second</b> <b>stomach</b> of the ruminant within 45 min. Hydrogels were found to release a model antigen, chromium-ethylenediamine tetracetic acid (Cr-EDTA), for up to 96 h to the small intestine. Cattle receiving leukotoxin-loaded hydrogels mounted a significantly greater immune response to virulent pasteurella haemolytica as compared to non-vaccinated control cattle.

30|$|Microbiota {{function}} prediction {{revealed that}} most of the metabolic pathways in the GIT are related to carbohydrate metabolism. This finding is consistent with the observation that Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes are predominantly abundant in the GIT. Importantly, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes are the dominant species aiding the digestion of complex carbohydrates in the GIT of ruminants (Evans et al. 2011; Spence et al. 2006). In the present study, higher diversity was detected in the stomach and large intestine than in the small intestine. Similarly, a previous research detected that the microbial fermentation and absorption of indigestible dietary substrates primarily occur in the rumen and colon and not in the small intestine (Abbeele et al. 2011). Another research reported that the rumen and colon of the North American moose are distinct environments (Ishaq and Wright 2012). In general, feed and fodder are first ingested and absorbed in the stomach of ruminants, the rest are ingested in the small and large intestine. In addition, the rumen is the most important segment of nutrient utilization (Kebreab et al. 2009), which primarily involves protein metabolism and plant secondary metabolism. Nevertheless, main nutrients, particularly proteins, are absorbed in the small intestine (Klieve 2005). Importantly, the rapid uptake and conversion of simple carbohydrates help maintain the micro-ecological balance of the small intestine (Zoetendal et al. 2012). In addition, indigested feed including some cellulose and starch can be completely but slowly assimilated in the large intestine (Armstrong and Smithard 1979). In the present study, we detected that some metabolic pathways related to microbial decomposition were significantly more abundant in the stomach than in the small intestine and large intestine. In addition, the metabolic pathways related to microbial synthesis (“Transporters”, “Ribosome Biogenesis”, and “Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis”) were abundant in the reticulum. The reticulum is the <b>second</b> <b>stomach</b> along the GIT of ruminants and is conducive to the uniformity in the rumen fluid microbiome through the churning action with rumen (Braun 2009). A recent study has analyzed the bacterial composition of the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and abomasum of bovine for the first time by using a metagenomic approach (Peng et al. 2015). The primary composition of the microbiome was determined in the rumen, reticulum, and omasum. In addition, the metabolic pathways related to lipid metabolism and pattern-recognition receptors were significantly more abundant in the small intestine than in the stomach and large intestine. In general, lipid metabolism is primarily determined in the small intestine. Genes involved in the lipid metabolism are expressed in response to changes in the barrier lipids of the skin of sheep (Ovis aries) for their more significant role of volatile fatty acids (Jiang et al. 2014). We also detected that the metabolic pathways related to the motility of bacterial proteins and the chemotaxis of bacteria are significantly more abundant in the jejunum in other segments of the GIT. A previous in vitro study showed that the intestinal contents from the jejunum can digest cellulose and neutral detergent fiber (Jiao et al. 2013).|$|E
40|$|I. One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} developments in our knowledge of gastric mucosal pathobiology has been the recognition of the relationship between Helicobacter infection, chronic gastritis, induction of lymphoid follicles in the mucosa (MALT) C and gastric lymphoma. Difficulties in distinguishing histologically between florid reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, sometimes termed "pseudolymphoma, " and lymphoid neoplasia have long been recognized. More recently, monoclonality of lymphoid proliferations and the presence of gene rearrangements have been taken as evidence of transformation to a neoplastic state, and molecular techniques have increased our sensitivity over histology in detecting these lesions. However, the demonstration by Isaacson's group, subsequently confirmed by others, that early MALT lymphomas, diagnosed by morphologic and molecular criteria are not autonomous but are driven by specific Helicobacter antigens in the presence of T cells and regress upon elimination of the Helicobacter infection, is both intriguing and important [1, 2].

40|$|Two large {{specimens}} of a hitherto unknown species of neotropical catfish {{have recently been}} found dead and washed ashore beneath the dike along the Westerscheldt near Biezelinge, Zeeland, at a mutual distance of approximately 300 meters. Both were in excellent condition and have been presented to the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie at Leiden by Mr. B. J. J. R. Walrecht. A superficial examination already disclosed {{the fact that the}} two specimens belong to the (sub) genus Selenaspis, a well known group of catfishes inhabiting the salt and brackish shores and estuaries of {{the northern part of the}} South American continent. Some of the species are known to spawn in fresh water. The present specimens must have been transported by ship. Whether they have been thrown overboard dead or alive remains uncertain though the first possibility seems more plausible.

40|$|As alterações funcionais da motilidade antroduodenal ainda não foram bem caracterizadas até a presente data. O marca-passo gástrico, possivelmente localiza-se junto à grande curvatura, próximo ao fundo gástrico. A partir dele, ondas de despolarização dirigem-se ao estômago, duodeno e às demais partes do intestino delgado. OBJETIVO: Avaliar a influência do marca-passo gástrico sobre a motilidade {{gastroduodenal}} em cães. MÉTODOS: O protocolo experimental constou de três etapas. Na primeira, realizou-se esofagostomia cervical seguida de manometria antroduodenal eletrônica e pH-metria em 20 cães (grupo controle), durante 4 horas. Na segunda etapa, realizou-se a ressecção de parte do fundo gástrico e da área do marca-passo gástrico, com técnica videolaparoscópica. Na terceira, decorridos três meses, repetiu-se a manometria antroduodenal e a pH-metria gástrica. RESULTADOS: No grupo controle observou-se traçado típico de motilidade antroduodenal, com complexo interdigestivo de motilidade (IMC) com fases 1, 2 e 3; na pH-metria, observou-se padrão de acidez com linha de base em pH de 1, 15. Após a ressecção gástrica parcial, a manometria apresentou, no geral, aumento na freqüência de contrações, aumento da participação relativa da fase 2 e diminuição da participação relativa da fase 3. No pH gástrico, observou-se aumento no percentual de pH 0 - 1 e pH 1 - 2, bem como diminuição na porcentagem de pH 6 - 7, com conseqüente diminuição do pH gástrico e redução no tempo prandial. CONCLUSÃO: Pela retirada da área do marca-passo gástrico ocorreram alterações de motilidade antroduodenal, permanecendo porém a ocorrência de IMC's completos. BACKGROUND: Functional alterations of antroduodenal motility are {{not well}} defined at present. The gastric pacemaker {{is located at the}} greater curvature, next to the fundus. PURPOSE: The aim was to evaluate the influence of the gastric pacemaker on the gastroduodenal motility in dogs. METHODS: The study was designed in three steps and performed with 20 dogs: first, construction of a cervical esophagostomy to measure the antroduodenal motility and gastric pH-metry as validation step. The manometry was performed by means of a six point electronic manometry probe and both manometry and pH-metry were recorded during 4 hours. <b>Second,</b> the <b>stomach's</b> pacemaker region and gastric reservoir were resected by videolaparoscopy.

RESULTS: In the validation step, there was established a typical dogs' antroduodenal motility pattern, with a three-shaped interdigestive motility complex (IMC) (phases 1 to 3); the gastric pH-metry showed a baseline at pH 1, 15. After partial gastric resection, overall there was an increase in contractions' frequency, an increase in phase 2 and a decrease in phase 3 participation on the IMC's. Regarding the gastric pH measurements, there was an increase in pH intervals 0 - 1 and 1 - 2 and a decrease in pH intervals 6 - 7; overall, there was a decrease in the stomach's pH and a decrease in the prandial time.
