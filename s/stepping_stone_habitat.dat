This is still an open question for Maculinea species despite {{they are among the}} best studied and emblematic butterfly species, because none of the population dynamics models developed so far included dispersal. Methodology/Principal Findings: We developed the first spatially and financially explicit Population Viability Analysis model for Maculinea alcon, using field data from The Netherlands. Implemented using the RAMAS/GIS platform, the model incorporated both local (contest density dependence, environmental and demographic stochasticities), and regional population dynamics (dispersal rates between habitat patches). We selected four habitat patch networks, contrasting in several basic features (number of habitat patches, their quality, connectivity, and occupancy rate) to test how these features are affecting the ability to enhance population viability of four basic management options, designed to incur the same costs: habitat enlargement, habitat quality improvement, creation of new <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> <b>habitat</b> patches, and reintroduction of captive-reared butterflies.

Overall, the best cost-effective option was enlargement of existing habitat patches, followed by either habitat quality improvement or creation of stepping stones depending on the network features. Reintroduction was predicted to generally be inefficient, except in one specific patch network. Conclusions/Significance Our results underline the importance of spatial and regional aspects (dispersal and connectivity) in determining the impact of conservation actions, even for a species previously considered as sedentary. They also illustrate that failure to account for the cost of management scenarios can lead to very different conclusions...|$|E
40|$|Landscape changes {{caused by}} rapid {{economic}} growth and broad scale rural-to-urban migration in China have contributed to significant degradation of natural ecosystems and loss of biodiversity {{in the past two}} decades. Nanchang City, the capital of Jiangxi Province in southeastern China, exemplifies the challenges of sustainable natural resource design and management implicit in a fast growing city. The city is situated in the floodplain of Poyang Lake, China’s largest freshwater lake and one that is characterized by a long history of frequent flooding. After the extreme floods in the Poyang Lake Region in 1998, the central Chinese government launched new policies to return reclaimed land to floodplains and the Poyang Lake, aiming to increase the lake size to its level in the 1950 ’s. The Poyang Lake Region attracts thousands of waterfowl each year including 95 % of the world’s Siberian crane population. Due to loss of regional wetland habitat, migrating birds frequently visit green open space in the city. This phenomenon points to the importance of urban ecological design for Nanchang City. This study investigates the landscape history and the development trajectory of Taohua, a 3, 022 -acre green field in Nanchang requested for a future urban district. Situated between the Gan River and Xiang Lake, Taohua is one of the two large green fields in the Nanchang urban scope and is protected from floods by levees. The predominance of agriculture and nutrient rich aquaculture precludes the full realization of Taohua’s ecological functions and services despite its undeveloped status. Ecological restoration and improved flood protection have to be considered at the same time because it is essential to the public that the future is safe from flooding Therefore, this thesis utilizes a normative scenario approach to invent and evaluate three plausible and socially and ecologically desirable futures, with the final goal of educating the public and provoking a conversation among stakeholders about what the future landscape should be. Three radically different scenarios focus respectively on 1) enhancing <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> <b>habitat</b> for migrating birds; 2) reestablishing the hydrological network with improved flood management; 3) accommodating increasing land demand for new residents. All scenario designs draw inspiration from Taohua’s landscape history and are based on explicit ecological studies. Each scenario creates a future with explicit rendered landscape images to facilitate future decision-making. These scenarios demonstrate the way in which normative approaches can clarify and emphasize different ecological and social goals in a complex urban context...|$|E

40|$|Due {{to their}} small size (0. 02 - 1. 0 ha), {{distinct}} boundaries, and conditions highly contrasting {{with those in}} the surrounding area, midfield water bodies are regarded as the so-called habitat islands. Their effective conservation calls for knowledge on their inhabitants' dispersal potential. However, direct empirical data are available for very few species only, but dispersal potential of a species may be inferred indirectly, from its distribution. The study addressed the question whether there is spatial autocorrelation in the distribution of plant species in midfield water bodies, or if the distribution is random. Spatial distribution of the midfield water bodies surveyed was analysed using the CrimeStat software, while spatial autocorrelation in distribution of 29 species was explored with the joincount. test routine of R CRAN software. Explorative spatial data analysis (ESDA) involving join-count statistics showed the presence of positive spatial autocorrelation in the distribution of ten hydro- and helophytic species. In their case, ESDA made it possible to reject the random distribution hypothesis, which opens up an avenue for exploring spatial patterns. Activities promoting the occurrence of species with limited dispersal potential should take into account their preferences in terms of shorter distances between neighbouring sites. This should make it possible to plan conservation of midfield water bodies not only as refuges, but also as <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> <b>habitats</b> facilitating migrations of wild species growing in an agricultural landscape...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{show how the}} spatial {{configuration}} of habitat quality affects the spatial spread of a population in a heterogeneous environment. Our main result is that for species with limited dispersal ability and a landscape with isolated <b>habitats,</b> <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> patches of <b>habitat</b> greatly increase the ability of species to disperse. Our results show that increasing reproductive rate first enables and then accelerates spatial spread, whereas increasing the connectivity has a remarkable effect only in case of low reproductive rates. The importance of landscape structure varied according to the {{demographic characteristics of the}} population. To show this we present a spatially explicit habitat model taking into account population dynamics and habitat connectivity. The population dynamics are based on a matrix projection model and are calculated on each cell of a regular lattice. The parameters of the Leslie matrix depend on habitat suitability as well as density. Dispersal between adjacent cells takes place either unrestricted or with higher probability {{in the direction of a}} higher habitat quality (restricted dispersal). Connectivity is maintained by corridors and <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> of optimal <b>habitat</b> quality in our fragmented model landscape containing a mosaic of different habitat suitabilities.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Increasingly, {{conservation}} of tropical forest-dwelling species depends on maintaining their populations in human-dominated landscapes. Often, extensive deforestation has left only fragmented forests that {{are subject to}} human use, such as logging, {{and this is the}} case in the central Andes of Colombia, where 200 years of human use has left only 15 % of the forest, scattered in mostly very small, narrow fragments. This study evaluates the relationship impacts of both fragmentation and current bamboo forestry practices on red howler monkeys (Alouatta seniculus), the largest mammal remaining in this landscape. The underlying {{purpose of this study is}} to evaluate whether bamboo logging could be compatible with howlers' persistence in these forests, and if any changes in logging practice could improve prospects for howlers. A further goal is to identify opportunities to ameliorate the consequences of extreme habitat fragmentation, while providing benefits to the owners. Due to the fast growing characteristics of the bamboo, these forests could be used to increase habitat and to promote connectivity among fragments. Results of this study show both reasons to be optimistic and to be cautious about the prospects for bamboo forestry to be compatible with {{conservation of}} red howler monkeys. Bamboo logging does not directly impact the monkeys, who appear widely tolerant of logging activities since they do not impact their feeding trees. However, bamboo extraction damages seedling and sapling trees, which appear to recruit poorly in these forests, threatening the regeneration of the key food resources for the howlers. Combined with the impacts of fragment isolation, persistence of the howlers in this landscape likely depends on enhancing tree regeneration within logged bamboo fragments and expansion of existing fragments and creation of corridor or <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> <b>habitats</b> to promote movement of the monkeys among fragments. With relatively small changes in the implementation of management regulations, conservation of red howler monkeys could be greatly enhanced in this landscape...|$|R
40|$|Biological invasions {{often occur}} through {{expansion}} of satellite populations that become established at 2 ̆ 7 invasion hubs 2 ̆ 7. Invasion hubs {{can result from}} random dispersal events, but frequently arise when invading individuals actively choose habitats using cues that signify high-quality environments where the fitness consequences are positive. Theoretical studies suggest that targeted control at invasion hubs can effectively suppress the populations and impacts of invaders. In arid Australia, small dams that provide water for livestock function as invasion hubs by providing an invasive vertebrate, the cane toad Rhinella marina, with refuge from extreme aridity during the annual dry season. Toads are attracted to dams and use them as <b>stepping</b> <b>stone</b> <b>habitats</b> from which they disperse during rainy periods. Here, we ask whether sustained control of this invasive vertebrate {{can be achieved by}} converting invasion hubs into ecological traps. We did this by manipulating invasion hub habitats to induce a mismatch between toads 2 ̆ 7 habitat preference and the fitness consequences of their habitat choice to cause high mortality. We constructed fences to exclude toads from dams and maintained these fences for 1 year. This period encompassed periods of dry and wet seasonal climatic conditions. Our manipulation did not alter the attractive cues for invading toads which died en masse while attempting to settle at fenced dams that prevented toads from reaching water. Toad populations at the fenced dams were suppressed by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude compared to unfenced controls and procedural controls. Toad populations remained suppressed for a year after exclusion. By excluding toads from dams, we converted invasion hubs into ecological traps and effectively thwarted the reinvasion of cane toads. Our research suggests that water exclusion devices could be used to prevent toad invasion or to control cane toad populations in arid landscapes colonized by toads. Synthesis and applications. Our study demonstrates that sustained control of invader populations can be achieved by restricting their access to invasion hubs. Control of invasive species via elimination of invasion hubs could be conducted reactively, to control established populations of invaders, or conducted strategically, by rendering invasion hubs unsuitable for colonization ahead of the invasion front to prevent further population spread...|$|R

40|$|In {{a time of}} {{increasing}} urbanization, the fundamental value of conserving urban biodiversity remains controversial. How much of a fixed budget should be spent on conservation in urban versus nonurban landscapes? The answer should depend on the goals that drive our conservation actions, yet proponents of urban conservation often fail to specify the motivation for protecting urban biodiversity. This is an important shortcoming on several fronts, including a missed {{opportunity to make a}} stronger appeal to those who believe conservation biology should focus exclusively on more natural, wilder landscapes. We argue that urban areas do offer an important venue for conservation biology, but that we must become better at choosing and articulating our goals. We explored seven possible motivations for urban biodiversity conservation: preserving local biodiversity, creating <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> to nonurban <b>habitat,</b> understanding and facilitating responses to environmental change, conducting environmental education, providing ecosystem services, fulfilling ethical responsibilities, and improving human well-being. To attain all these goals, challenges must be faced that are common to the urban environment, such as localized pollution, disruption of ecosystem structure, and limited availability of land. There are, however, also challenges specific only to particular goals, meaning that different goals will require different approaches and actions. This highlights the importance of specifying the motivations behind urban biodiversity conservation. If the goals are unknown, progress cannot be assessed...|$|R
40|$|It has {{recently}} been proposed that microrefugia {{played an important role}} in species survival during past climate change events. However, the current distributions of microrefugia remain largely unknown. Wind-hole sites are areas affected by preferential flows of cool air generated in interstitial spaces created by rock fragments or colluvia. Alpine plant species occurring in lowland wind-hole sites isolated from alpine zones may be relicts of the last glacial period. Hokkaido, northern Japan, is known to contain many wind-hole sites in which alpine plant species can occur. Here we surveyed 55 wind-hole sites in the Kitami region, eastern Hokkaido, and observed two alpine plant species (lingonberry, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, and Labrador tea, Rhododendron groenlandicum ssp. diversipilosum var. diversipilosum) in 14 wind-hole sites. Statistical modeling showed that wind-hole sites are likely to occur in areas with high maximum slope angles and volcanic rock cover, and concave surfaces. Our predictions of wind-hole site distributions suggest that such topographic conditions are common in our study area, and that many undiscovered wind-hole sites exist. Ignoring microhabitats may greatly underestimate species distributions in topographically complex regions, and dispersed cool spots may also function as <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> and temporal <b>habitats</b> for cold-adapted species. Because these localized unique habitats usually occur in economically unproductive sites, identifying and protecting potential microrefugia (cool spots) would be a robust and cost-effective mitigation of climate change impacts...|$|R

40|$|ACL (avec facteur d'impact) International audienceThe {{improvement}} of tools for protecting biodiversity requires integrating habitat connectivity to build efficient ecological networks that facilitate {{the movement of}} species under pressure from global change. Several methodological and scientific challenges are faced in constructing such networks. First, ecological networks need to incorporate habitat connectivity for species with different ecological requirements. Secondly, the networks {{should be based on}} functional connectivity rather than on structural connectivity alone. Thirdly, connectivity needs to be treated as a continuous variable. We propose a non-oriented approach of landscape description to identify favourable areas and measure functional connectivity for multi-specific applications, using three groups of common bird species (farmland specialists, forest specialists and generalists) as indicators of biodiversity. In the highly anthropized region of Seine-et-Marne, we defined 20 landscape types based on composition and configuration. We used statistical modelling to obtain a value of favourability for each landscape type for each bird group. We then mapped landscape favourability, for the three groups in 1982 and 2003 to identify favourable entities (adjacent favourable landscape units) and determine connectivity. We then examined temporal changes in the favourable areas and their connectivity and determined the sensitivity of the favourable landscape types to land cover change. Composition and configuration both influenced landscape favourability. Some landscape types were favourable for several groups of species and could potentially serve as junction landscapes in ecological networks that accommodate a variety of ecological requirements. Increasing urbanization and fragmentation between 1982 and 2003 resulted in a decrease in favourable landscape units, as well as consequent decreases in favourable areas and connectivity, for the three species groups. Connectivity loss was greatest for farmland and generalist species, as it was already high for forest species in 1982. Such a non-oriented landscape description could be used to delineate multi-specific ecological networks at regional and national scales and could be further developed to study the connectivity of communities. The maps of favourability produced here could also be used in combination with other methods, such as graphs or circuits, to detect ecological corridors and <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> to <b>habitat</b> connectivity...|$|R

Responses to these manipulations were quantified in terms of step-length and step-time adjustments, the percentage correction achieved over subsequent steps, and the number of steps required to restore the relation between gait and the beeps or <b>stepping</b> <b>stones.</b> The results showed that perturbations in a sequence of <b>stepping</b> <b>stones</b> were overcome faster than those in a sequence of metronome beeps.
