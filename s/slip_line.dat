40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to assess the {{feasibility}} of a homogeneousâor defect-freeâinitiation mechanism for high energetic materials in which initiation is {{a direct consequence of}} the heterogeneity of crystal plasticity at the subgrain scale. In order to assess the feasibility of these mechanisms, we develop a multiscale model that explicitly accounts for three scales: (i) the polycrystalline structure at the macroscale, (ii) single-crystal plasticityâincluding subgrain microstructure formationâat the mesoscale, and (iii) chemical kinetics at the molecular scale. An explicit construction gives the effective or macroscopic behavior of plastically deforming crystals with microstructure, and enables the reconstruction of optimal microstructures from the computed macroscopic averages.
