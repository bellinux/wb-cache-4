5|$|During the 1930s, several {{economic}} and climatic conditions combined with disastrous results for <b>South</b> <b>Dakota.</b> A lack of rainfall, extremely high temperatures and inappropriate cultivation techniques produced {{what was known}} as the Dust Bowl in <b>South</b> <b>Dakota</b> and several other plains states. Fertile topsoil was blown away in massive dust storms, and several harvests were completely ruined. The experiences of the Dust Bowl, coupled with local bank foreclosures and the general economic effects of the Great Depression, resulted in many South Dakotans leaving the state. The population of <b>South</b> <b>Dakota</b> declined by more than 7% between 1930 and 1940.|$|E
5|$|Eastern <b>South</b> <b>Dakota</b> {{generally}} features higher precipitation {{and lower}} topography than {{the western part}} of the state. Smaller geographic regions of this area include the Coteau des Prairies, the Dissected Till Plains, and the James River Valley. The Coteau des Prairies is a plateau bordered on the east by the Minnesota River Valley and on the west by the James River Basin. Further west, the James River Basin is mostly low, flat, highly eroded land, following the flow of the James River through <b>South</b> <b>Dakota</b> from north to south. The Dissected Till Plains, an area of rolling hills and fertile soil that covers much of Iowa and Nebraska, extends into the southeastern corner of <b>South</b> <b>Dakota.</b> Layers deposited during the Pleistocene epoch, starting around two million years ago, cover most of eastern <b>South</b> <b>Dakota.</b> These are the youngest rock and sediment layers in the state, the product of several successive periods of glaciation which deposited a large amount of rocks and soil, known as till, over the area.|$|E
