Her Arab-inspired patterns of this period include Kungatar, Naamio, Sadunkertoja, Tumma, and Välly.

25|$|After {{returning}} from Siberia, Swenson worked in Seattle for American Biscuit Company {{for a year}} and a half. In May 1904 he married Emma Charlotte Johnson in Seattle. Charlotte, as <b>she</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> be known, had immigrated from Sweden in 1903. They had at least one son and two daughters. Their son died in Nome in 1910 of diphtheria contracted on board ship from Seattle. Their daughter Marion was born about 1912 and Marjorie (sometimes spelled Marguery or Margery) about 1918.|$|E
25|$|De Casseres met Adele Mary Jones (née Terrill) in 1902. They {{were both}} {{staying at the}} same {{boarding}} house and only saw each other a few times before Bio (as <b>she</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> be called) moved West with her husband Harry O. Jones in early 1903. Over the next 16 years, De Casseres and Bio Jones corresponded frequently, developing a long-distance romantic relationship, until Jones divorced her husband in 1919 and married De Casseres the same year. They remained married until De Casseres' death in 1945.|$|E
25|$|Grigory Orlov, the {{grandson}} of a rebel in the Streltsy Uprising (1698) against Peter the Great, distinguished himself in the Battle of Zorndorf (25 August 1758), receiving three wounds. He represented an opposite to Peter's pro-Prussian sentiment, with which Catherine disagreed. By 1759, Catherine and he had become lovers; no one told Catherine's husband, the Grand Duke Peter. Catherine saw Orlov as very useful, and he became instrumental in the 28 June 1762 coup d’état against her husband, but <b>she</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> remain the Dowager Empress of Russia, rather than marrying anyone.|$|E

25|$|He married Dawn Gibbons in 1985; {{they have}} a son, born in 1987. Dawn Gibbons did not move to Washington {{to live with her}} husband while he served in Congress, saying <b>she</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> raise their son in Nevada. She herself was elected to the Nevada State Assembly in 1998, two years after Jim Gibbons was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. On May 2, 2008, Gibbons filed for divorce, citing grounds of {{incompatibility}} stemming from an undisclosed event in Reno, Nevada and requesting the court to determine whether Gibbons or his wife would live at the governor's mansion.|$|E
25|$|Later, in October, one of Insolents boats hit a rock, {{with the}} result that her captain and three seamen drowned. The purser's {{daughter}} was on the boat and one of the seaman swam for the shore, carrying her on his back. As he swam her clothes became sodden and he informed the young woman that unless she agreed to let him remove her clothes he could not carry her further. She refused, stating that <b>she</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> die than compromise her virtue. He swam on for a bit with her, still clothed, on his back, but eventually, exhausted, he had to let her go and watch her drown.|$|E
25|$|This {{came to a}} {{head when}} a {{fugitive}} criminal claimed sanctuary in an Augustinian church in Manila. An artilleryman, Francisco de Nava, owned a female slave named María, with whom he was having illicit relations. The archbishop, upon learning this, ordered Nava to sell the slave. When he refused, she was taken from him and sold. The artilleryman soon tried to get the slave back, declaring he wanted to marry her. One day he saw the woman passing in a carriage with her new mistress, who happened to be the governor-general's wife. Going up to the carriage, he spoke to the woman, but she replied that <b>she</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> be the slave of another than his wife. Thereupon Nava, blind with anger, drew his dagger and killed her.|$|E

25|$|Alice, Dowager Countess of Derby {{was also}} Dowager Viscountess Brackley. Her second husband Thomas Egerton, Lord Ellesmere, an eminent lawyer and Lord Chancellor of England, {{had died in}} 1617. But the Derby title was the one <b>she</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> be known by, {{and it is the}} one by which she is {{described}} on her funeral monument, which is surely one of the finest of its time anywhere in England. The mourning daughters beside the tomb are not meant to be lifelike representations of her actual daughters, Anne, Frances and Elizabeth; they conform to a stereotype often observed on grand monuments of this kind. But the figure of Alice Countess of Derby is probably closer to historical reality. She wears the coronet of a Countess, not a Viscountess, and at the foot of her tomb is a coroneted eagle, a reminder of the Stanleys' armorial crest. This commemorates their descent from the Lathoms, which was the foundation of their fortunes.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, Ganpal Lal Batto died {{suddenly}} in a road accident. His death left Shamshad very distraught, {{because her husband}} had been the focus of her life and they had both been extremely devoted to each other. He had handled many aspects of her career and contracts and had been a major positive energy behind her career progression. After his death, Shamshad became listless and lost the fighting spirit to pursue her career, which registered a sharp decline thereafter. Indeed, while Shamshad Begum was both an outstanding singer and a successful famous one, she was at some deeper level always a wife and mother first, someone who instinctively prioritised her family over her career. By nature, <b>she</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>to</b> keep away from the public glare and from business dealings, taking the view that it was rather unseemly for a lady to be involved in such things. After her husband's death, Shamshad Begum began living with her daughter and son-in-law in Mumbai, first in south Mumbai and later at Hiranandani Gardens in the Powai neighbourhood. She gradually became a recluse and devoted herself entirely to her grandchildren, {{to the point that the}} general public was unaware of whether she was alive or dead. In 2004, a controversy erupted in the media, when several publications wrongly reported that Shamshad Begum had died a few years previously. Shamshad's family clarified in a press release that this was not so; and it later emerged that the Shamshad Begum who had died in 1998 was Saira Banu's maternal grandmother. Her self-imposed seclusion is remarkable, because during all those decades away from the public eye, her old songs remained popular with the public and not a day passed without at least a couple of songs being played on Vividh Bharati and All India Radio.|$|E
