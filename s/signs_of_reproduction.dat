Their physical <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> were also recorded, including descended testicles in males, pregnancy, lactation, and perforated vagina in females. For males, descended testicles {{indicate that they}} are reproductively capable, whereas for females, pregnancy and lactation indicate breeding, and perforated vagina indicates mating. Therefore, these physical signs are more direct indicators of reproduction in females than in males. The mice were immediately released after processing at the station where they were captured. All procedures in mice trapping and sampling were approved by the National Taiwan Normal University’s Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol no. 102004).|$|E

The nrst <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> are evident well {{before the arrival of}} Spring. Sexually mature adults inhabit the cold, rocky streams of southwestern West Virginia in early February. Females arc known by the presence of large oocytes visible through the body wall and males by their extremely swollen heads. Breeding occurs in the stream during late March and is marked by the presence of gravid females with spenn caps in their posterior cloacae. Eggs are deposited from mid-March through early April on the underside of flat rocks in cool, shallow, and swiftly Ilowing streams. Females guard their nests against potential predators, including other two-lined salamanders. Hatchlings emerge as miniature adults with gills aner several months of development...|$|E

40|$|Research on {{arboreal}} mammals {{living in}} Mediterranean forests is poor. Molecular research assessed {{the existence of}} an evolutionary significant unit in the edible dormouse populations living in south Italy, Sicily and Sardinia, and we decided to investigate the environmental factors capable of explaining its occurrence and abundance in Sicily, for a better management of these populations. We assessed the species habitat preferences by setting 25 large and 25 small nestboxes in five sample areas along an altitudinal gradient of the Madonie Range, and recorded habitat variables, food availability, and demographic data for two years. To obtain synthetic descriptors of the dormice habitat requirements, we extracted uncorrelated linear combinations of original variables by Principal Component Analysis; then we modelled habitat preferences of dormice by Generalized Linear Models, and selected the best models by Akaike’s information criterion and model averaging. Dormice abundances varied markedly between the two years of study. Population peaked and reproduced in 2010, a masting year of oaks and beeches. In the following non-masting year, a much lower number of adults and yearlings used nestboxes, without any <b>sign</b> <b>of</b> <b>reproduction.</b> In both years we found a significant effect of altitudinal vegetation belt. Dormice seem to prefer mixed broad-leaved and evergreen (cork, holm) oak forests below 800 - 1300 m a. s. l, to beech forests at higher altitude, and avoid coniferous plantations. Inside these woodlands they seem to prefer monotypic and mature oak-stands with dense canopies. Large nestboxes are more preferred than small ones only during reproductive years. Protection of large and mature woodland from wildfires and forestry management caring the retention of significant elements like old trees, logs and litter mounds are necessary to maintain the habitat of edible dormouse in Southern Mediterranean forests. Artificial nestboxes are a viable device to help population restocking in degraded forests...|$|R

40|$|Historically, Rocky Mountain National Park (RMNP) has {{supported}} {{a small black}} bear (Ursus americanus) population of low productivity. Increased visitor use {{of the park and}} development around its periphery could lead to a reduction in population viability of RMNP’s bear population or could increase the potential for human–bear conflict. Therefore, we investigated contemporary survival and productivity parameters for RMNP’s black bear population from 2003 to 2006 and compared these values to historic levels (1984 – 1991) and population means throughout the western United States to clarify the current status of RMNP’s bear population. The contemporary black bear population showed <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> earlier <b>reproduction</b> and higher cub survival when compared to historic bears; litter size and adult and subadult survival were similar between contemporary and historic periods. Increased productivity of the contemporary population was likely due to better nutritional condition of reproductive females, which showed significantly higher body condition index scores, body fat, and weights, which are likely due to observed greater use of anthropogenic food sources. The population of black bears in RMNP may have greater growth potential than was observed historically, decreasing the reliance on immigration from adjacent populations. However, increased human–bear conflicts associated with greater use of human-associated habitats in RMNP may negate some of the advantages of increased population productivity because of removal of problem bears...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstractIn {{honey bee}} colonies, workers, in {{particular}} of “anarchistic” lineages, can activate their ovaries and lay eggs, {{even in the}} presence of the queen. We identified three queenright colonies showing typical <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> worker <b>reproduction.</b> To characterize this new lineage, we extracted the mandibular gland and analyzed it using gas chromatography. The total amounts of the five main components of the mandibular gland, namely methyl p-hydroxyben-zoate (HOB), 9 -oxo- 2 (E) -decenoic acid (9 -ODA), (S) - 9 -hydroxy-(E) - 2 -decenoic acid (9 -HDA), 10 -HDA, and 10 -hydroxyde-canoic acid (10 -HDAA) were significantly higher in the mandibular gland profiles of workers with activated ovaries (AWs, 8. 88 [*]±[*] 1. 71  μg) compared to workers with inactivated ovaries (IAWs, 4. 00 [*]±[*] 2. 09  μg). Furthermore, the chemical profiles of IAWs were dominated by the “worker substances” 10 -HDA (34. 64 [*]±[*] 8. 19  %) and its precursor 10 -HDAA (22. 88 [*]±[*] 4. 95  %), while the chemical profiles in AWs were dominated by the precursor of the queen substance 9 -HDA (40. 04 [*]±[*] 7. 55  %). The ratios of two precursor substances 10 -HDAA/ 9 -HDA of IAWs were more worker like (> 1. 0) whereas AWs were more queen like (≤ 1. 0). These results suggest that the mandibular pheromones of anarchistic workers resemble a more queen-like reproductive active profile and that these workers may represent a reversion to a more basal reproductive phenotype...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEffective {{protection}} against sea lice (Lepeoptheirus salmonis and Caligus elongatus) was documented {{over three years}} during the production of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) in floating enclosures with water intake at 25 m depth. Moderate to high sea lice abundance in reference groups in open cages confirmed the presence of infective sea lice copepodites in the surface water around the cages. In the closed cages, sea lice were only recorded after fish had been moved between cages with well boats, or when the cages were stocked with fish transferred from open cages. When fish were exposed to sea lice in the closed cages, the recorded abundance was low and with no <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> sea lice <b>reproduction</b> within the cages.

40|$|Changes in {{the genetic}} {{structure}} and genotypic {{variation of the}} aphid Sitobion avenae collected from cereal crops in northern France were examined by analysing variation at five microsatellite loci across several years and seasons. Little regional and temporal differentiation was detected, as shown by very low F(ST) among populations. Repeated genotypes, significant heterozygote deficits, positive F(IS) values and frequent linkage disequilibria were found in nearly all samples, suggesting an overall pattern of reproductive mode variation in S. avenae populations. In addition, samples from Brittany (Bretagne) showed greater <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> asexual <b>reproduction</b> than those from the north of France, indicating a trend toward increasing sexuality northward. These patterns of reproductive variation in S. avenae are consistent with theoretical models of selection of aphid reproductive modes by climate. Contrasting with little changes in allelic frequencies, genotypic composition varied substantially in time and, to a lesser extent, in space. All important part of changes in genotypic arrays {{was due to the}} variation in frequency distribution of common genotypes, i. e. those that were found at several instances in the samples. Genotypic composition was also shown to vary according to climate, as genotypic diversity in spring was significantly correlated with the severity of the previous winter and autumn. We propose that the genetic homogeneity among S. avenae populations shown here across large temporal and spatial scales is the result of two forces: (i) migration conferred by high dispersal capabilities, and (ii) selection over millions of hectares of cereals (mostly wheat) bred from a narrow genetic base...|$|R
40|$|We {{identify}} {{fishery management}} implications from a long-term monitoring program focusing on spawning aggregations of high valued reef fish in Komodo National Park (KNP), Eastern Indonesia. Management objectives of KNP {{are not only}} to protect biodiversity, but also to conserve spawning stocks of high-valued commercial species for the replenishment of surrounding fishing grounds. We monitored two sites twice monthly over five years for two species of grouper, Epinephelus fuscoguttatus and Plectropomus areolatus. One site had an aggregation of both E. fuscoguttatus and P. areolatus, whereas the other site contained an aggregation of P. areolatus only. Over the five years monitoring period, aggregations typically formed during each full moon between September and February. Additionally, P. areolatus occasionally aggregated during new moons between April and July. We observed spawning only once, but because formation of aggregations were correlated to a higher incidence <b>of</b> behavior and <b>signs</b> indicative <b>of</b> <b>reproduction</b> and because most fish present were adults, {{it is likely that}} the formation of aggregations was associated with spawning. Over the five years monitoring period there was a reduction in mean fish size of up to 8 cm for P. areolatus, and a reduction in numbers of aggregating E. fuscoguttatus. Despite limited protection initiated in 2001, both sites are still heavily fished by local artisanal fishers. Because the observed reductions in size and in numbers could be caused by fishing pressure, managers should follow the precautionary principle by putting additional protective management in place. Since both species are relatively long-lived, at least five years of continued monitoring may be necessary to determine the outcome of management intervention. The variability in timing of aggregation in respect to season and moon phase in P. areolatus indicates that long-term monitoring must cover the entire year and both moon phases. © Springer 2005. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The increasing acidification from the coastal to inland/highland region of Southern and Southeastern Norway (pH 7. 2 - 4. 1) {{was accompanied by a}} decreasing frequency of amphibian (Rana temporaria, Bufo bufo and Triturus vulgaris) localities. In the (anthropogenically) non-acidified Central Norway region (pH 6. 8 - 4. 6), R. temporaria was very common at all pH levels. The data strongly suggest that acidification explains the absence of amphibians locally in the acidified areas, and has caused their extinction in the inland/highland region of Southern Norway. A pH of 4. 5 - 4. 6 is the critical minimum for R. temporaria populations in small, poorly buffered, boggy, water-bodies as were investigated here. For B. bufo, the lowest pH recorded was 4. 7, and for T. vulgaris 4. 8. We did not find any <b>signs</b> <b>of</b> successful <b>reproduction</b> in Rana arvalis and Triturus cristatus below a pH of 5. 2 and 5. 3, respectively. Increased contents of Ca 2 +, Na+ (NaCl) or humus (NOM) had an ameliorating effect on the amphibians in acidic water. The presence of Al was of only minor importance for the amphibians in humic waters. In a strategy for the conservation of amphibians in acidified or acidifying areas, liming (CaCO 3) and/or NaCl treatment of the localities may work well in order to establish a satisfying aquatic environment for the species. The study may act as a baseline for further surveys in the future when acidic precipitation hopefully has decreased, looking for improvements of the habitats and possible recoveries of amphibian sites. </p...|$|R

In order to investigate reproductive toxicity (segment I), pregnant rats received orally 0. 5 or 1. 0 [*]g/kg of extract, daily, during 18 days.
