This was reported by NASA to be a critical technology, granting the instrument the high sensitivity needed to achieve mission objectives. Late in its development, however, poorly understood anomalous heating in the cryogenic magnet system was discovered. As a result, the AMS-02 experiment leader, Samuel C. C. Ting, decided to replace the <b>superconducting</b> <b>magnet</b> inside the spectrometer with the permanent magnet previously used in AMS-01.|$|E
25|$|The {{required}} utility {{resources are}} significantly larger for EUV compared to 193nm immersion, even with two exposures using the latter. Hynix {{reported at the}} 2009 EUV Symposium that the wall plug efficiency was ~0.02% for EUV, i.e., to get 200 W at intermediate focus for 100 WPH, one would require 1MW of input power, compared to 165kW for an ArF immersion scanner, and that even at the same throughput, the footprint of the EUV scanner was ~3x the footprint of an ArF immersion scanner, resulting in productivity loss. Additionally, to confine ion debris, a <b>superconducting</b> <b>magnet</b> may be required.|$|E
25|$|NMR spectrometers are {{relatively}} expensive; universities usually have them, {{but they are}} less common in private companies. Modern NMR spectrometers have a very strong, large and expensive liquid helium-cooled <b>superconducting</b> <b>magnet,</b> because resolution directly depends on magnetic field strength. Less expensive machines using permanent magnets and lower resolution are also available, which still give sufficient performance for certain application such as reaction monitoring and quick checking of samples. There are even benchtop nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometers. NMR {{can be observed in}} magnetic fields less than a millitesla. Low-resolution NMR produces broader peaks which can easily overlap one another causing issues in resolving complex structures. The use of higher strength magnetic fields result in clear resolution of the peaks and is the standard in industry.|$|E

25|$|Eguchi et al. (2003) have {{investigated}} the use of magnetic fields in order to align Schwann cells. They used a horizontal type <b>superconducting</b> <b>magnet,</b> which produces an 8 T field at its center. Within 60 hours of exposure, Schwann cells aligned parallel to the field; during the same interval, Schwann cells not exposed oriented in a random fashion. It is hypothesized that differences in magnetic field susceptibility of membrane components and cytoskeletal elements may cause the magnetic orientation. Collagen fibers were also exposed to the magnetic field, and within 2 hours, they aligned perpendicular to the magnetic field, while collagen fibers formed a random meshwork pattern without magnetic field exposure. When cultured on the collagen fibers, Schwann cells aligned along the magnetically oriented collagen after two hours of 8-T magnetic field exposure. In contrast, the Schwann cells randomly oriented on the collagen fibers without magnetic field exposure. Thus, culture on collagen fibers allowed Schwann cells to be oriented perpendicular to the magnetic field and oriented much quicker.|$|E

This work was a large effort, carrying detectors aloft with high-altitude balloon flights and high-flying U-2 aircraft, and an early precursor of the COBE satellite-born experiments on the cosmic background radiation (which resulted in the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize, shared by George Smoot and John Mather.) ...|$|E

2500|$|The ATLAS {{detector}} uses {{two large}} <b>superconducting</b> <b>magnet</b> systems to bend charged particles {{so that their}} momenta can be measured.

[...] Since all particles produced in the LHC's proton collisions are traveling at very close to the speed of light, the force on particles of different momenta is equal. [...] (In the theory of relativity, momentum is not linear proportional to velocity at such speeds.) [...] Thus high-momentum particles curve very little, while low-momentum particles curve significantly; the amount of curvature can be quantified and the particle momentum can be determined from this value.|$|E
2500|$|Fourier-transform ion {{cyclotron}} resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometry is a high-resolution technique {{that can be used}} to determine masses with high accuracy. Many applications of FTICR-MS use this mass accuracy to help determine the composition of molecules based on accurate mass. This is possible due to the mass defect of the elements. FTICR-MS is able to achieve higher levels of mass accuracy than other forms of mass spectrometer, in part, because a <b>superconducting</b> <b>magnet</b> is much more stable than radio-frequency (RF) voltage. [...] Another place that FTICR-MS is useful is in dealing with complex mixtures, such as biomass or waste liquefaction products, since the resolution (narrow peak width) allows the signals of two ions with similar mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) to be detected as distinct ions. [...] This high resolution is also useful in studying large macromolecules such as proteins with multiple charges, which can be produced by electrospray ionization. For example, attomole level of detection of two peptides has been reported. [...] These large molecules contain a distribution of isotopes that produce a series of isotopic peaks. Because the isotopic peaks are close to each other on the m/z axis, due to the multiple charges, the high resolving power of the FTICR is extremely useful. FTICR-MS is very useful in other studies of proteomics as well. It achieves exceptional resolution in both top-down and bottom-up proteomics. Electron-capture dissociation (ECD), collisional-induced dissociation (CID), and infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) are all utilized to produce fragment spectra in tandem mass spectrometry experiments. Although CID and IRMPD use vibrational excitation to further dissociate peptides by breaking the backbone amide linkages, which are typically low in energy and weak, CID and IRMPD may also cause dissociation of post-translational modifications. ECD, on the other hand, allows specific modifications to be preserved. This is quite useful in analyzing phosphorylation states, O- or N-linked glycosylation, and sulfating.|$|E

This rotating gantry can transport heavy ions having 430 MeV/nucleon to an isocenter with irradiation angles of over 0 - 360 degrees, and enables advanced radiation-therapy. To reduce the size and weight of the rotating gantry, we designed <b>superconducting</b> <b>magnets</b> that can independently excite dipole and quadrupole field.
