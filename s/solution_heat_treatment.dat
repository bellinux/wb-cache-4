The present paper {{focuses on the}} oxidation behaviour in dry air at temperature of 700 ºC with respect to oxidation kinetics. Solution treatment was applied to Fe- 33 Ni- 19 Cr alloy by means of different solution annealing temperature to alter the average grain size of the specimens. <b>Solution</b> <b>heat</b> <b>treatments</b> were carried out on Fe-Ni-Cr alloys at three different temperatures, namely, 1000 ºC, 1100 ºC and 1200 ºC. The {{results showed that the}} average grain size increased with increase in solution annealing temperature that was significantly affecting the oxidation kinetic of the materials. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed in this study to analyse the oxidation behaviour of solution-annealed samples. Smaller grain size improves the protective oxidation behaviour by enhancing spallation resistance and reducing oxidation rate. Spallation resistance correlates with a reduction in texture of the oxide layers...|$|R
