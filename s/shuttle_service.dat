5|$|Among {{the most}} {{important}} airport services are further transportation connections, including rail networks, taxi and <b>shuttle</b> <b>services</b> at curbside pick-up areas, and public buses. Large areas for automobile parking, often in co-located multi-storey car parks, are also typical to find at airports. Some airports provide <b>shuttle</b> <b>services</b> to parking garages for passengers and airport employees. Due to the very large scale of international airports, some have constructed <b>shuttle</b> <b>services</b> to transport passengers between terminals. Such systems operate for example, in Singapore Changi Airport and Zurich Airport.|$|R

From 1925 to 1934 these vehicles were used between Watford and Rickmansworth.|$|E

5|$|When Franklin and Providence/Stoughton service {{returned}} to the main line, service on the Midland had become popular enough to justify a continued <b>shuttle</b> <b>service</b> along the line from Boston to Fairmount. The Fairmount Shuttle was extended to Readville on November 30, 1987 as the Fairmount Line. Since 1987, Providence/Stoughton Line service has run through Readville without making a station stop, {{even though there are}} platforms in place to allow such use.|$|E

When operational problems occur on the line, Arnos Grove station may act as a temporary terminus of a reduced service – either a <b>shuttle</b> <b>service</b> between Arnos Grove and Cockfosters or a truncated service from Central London. The station has a set of seven sidings to its south for stabling trains.|$|E

5|$|Although some {{preparatory work}} was carried out, the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War in 1939 brought the electrification north of Rickmansworth to a halt. First class travel was abandoned by the LPTB, along with the Pullman cars, and the line was operated entirely as a <b>shuttle</b> <b>service.</b> In 1940 the Chesham branch was converted to autotrain working, in which the trains could be driven from each end, thus avoiding the time-consuming repositioning of the locomotive. LNER C13 Class locomotives were used for this push-pull working, along with two three-car sets of antiquated Ashbury passenger cars dating from 1898.|$|E
5|$|Before its takeover, the DR {{had carried}} out some joint {{electrification}} experiments with the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the other sub-surface line {{with which the}} DR shared the Inner Circle. A section of track between Earl's Court and High Street Kensington was electrified with a four-rail system and a jointly owned test train operated a <b>shuttle</b> <b>service</b> between February and November 1900. Having proven the practicality of electric traction, the two companies set up a joint committee to select a supplier of equipment for the electrification of their networks.|$|E
5|$|In March 1908, the {{off-peak}} <b>shuttle</b> <b>service</b> {{began to}} use the western tunnel on the branch, crossing between the two branch tunnels south of Holborn. Low usage led to {{the withdrawal of the}} second peak-hour shuttle and the eastern tunnel was taken out of use in 1914. Sunday services ended in April 1917 and, in August of the same year, the eastern tunnel and the bay platform at Holborn were formally closed. Passenger numbers on the branch remained low: when the branch was considered for closure in 1929, its annual usage was 1,069,650 and takings were £4,500. The branch was again considered for closure in 1933, but remained open.|$|E
