Figure 4 a reports the particle flux ratio F_ 1 /F_IN {{as a function of}} the flow rate ratio Q_ 1 /Q_IN for three different confinement ratios β = 0.1 (red circles), β = 0.2 (green circles) and β = 0.5 (blue circles). A point of the diagonal in this diagram (solid black line) indicates that the same fraction of particles is obtained between the inflow and outflow streams, i.e. the inflow particles are fractioned through the two outlets proportionally to the fluid flow rates. On the contrary, a point above (below) the diagonal denotes that the fluid exiting the main outlet (the <b>side</b> <b>outlet)</b> is enriched of particles as compared to the inlet. The enrichment is more and more pronounced as the deviation from the diagonal is large. The data reported in Figure 4 a show that fractionation is enhanced for a flow rate ratio above 0.5 and for the largest particle size considered. For lower Q_ 1 /Q_IN values, only slight (negative) deviations are noted even for the largest confinement ratio. As the particle becomes smaller, the separation process is less and less efficient regardless of the value of the flow rate ratio (the red and green circles are hardly distinguishable from the diagonal).|$|E
40|$|Measurement of {{plane wave}} {{acoustic}} transmission properties, so called two-port data, of flow duct components {{is important in}} many applications. It is an important tool for instance {{in the development of}} mufflers for IC-engines. Measurement of two-port data is difficult when the flow velocity in the measurement duct is high because of the flow noise contamination of the measured pressure signals. The plane wave acoustic two-port is a 2 x 2 matrix containing 4 complex quantities at each frequency. To experimentally determine these unknowns the acoustic state variables on the inlet and <b>outlet</b> <b>side</b> must be measured for two independent test cases. The two independent test cases can be created by: changing the acoustic load on the <b>outlet</b> <b>side</b> leading to the so-called two-load technique or by using one acoustic source on the inlet side and one acoustic source on the <b>outlet</b> <b>side</b> leading to the so-called two-source technique. In the latter case the independent test cases are created by first using the source on the inlet side and then the source on the <b>outlet</b> <b>side.</b> As pointed out by Åbom it is also possible to run both sources simultaneously to create more than two independent test cases. This over-determination could be used to improve the measurement results for instance if the data is contaminated by flow-noise. In this paper over-determination is tested by applying up to 5 different test cases. This procedure has been applied to a single orifice test object. QC 20120531 </p...|$|R

3000|$|Let us {{consider}} a fluid without particles that is pumped through the inlet {{branch of a}} T-shaped channel. Near the bifurcation, the fluid is partitioned between the two outlets according to the imposed pressure difference Δ p=p_OUT 1 -p_OUT 2. Specifically, if Δ p= 0 and if the outlet channels have the same height and length, it is Q_ 1 [...] Q_ 2, where Q_ 1 and Q_ 2 are the flow rates through the main and <b>side</b> <b>outlet</b> branches, respectively. (Actually, these two flow rates are not exactly equal because the bifurcation is asymmetric). In case of Δ p> 0 (Δ p< 0), the fluid encounters a higher resistance in the main channel (side channel) and prevalently moves through the other branch, i.e., Q_ 2 > Q_ 1 (Q_ 1 > Q_ 2). Of course, {{there will be two}} limiting values of Δ p (one positive and one negative) such that the fluid totally passes through only one outlet. In the general case, a critical streamline dividing the inflow section in two regions corresponding to the fluid portion that ends up in the two outlets can be identified. An example of this streamline is depicted as a blue line in Figure 1 a, which is at a coordinate y_f along the section of the inlet branch.|$|E

A series of particles with their densities ranging from 760 kg/m 3 to 1380 kg/m 3 were fed into the Vorsyl separator with water by means of tangential inlet. The simulation showed that the feed materials acquired centrifugal force which allows most portion of the particles with a density less than water {{to move to the}} center of the separator, enter the vortex finder and leave the separator through the bottom outlet. While the particles heavier than water move to the wall, reach the throat area and leave the separator through the <b>side</b> <b>outlet.</b> The particles were thus separated and particles collected at the bottom outlet are pure and clean. The influence of particle density on separation efficiency was investigated which demonstrated a positive correlation of the separation efficiency with increasing density difference between medium liquid and the particle. In addition, the influence of the split ratio on the performance was studied which showed that the separation efficiency of the Vorsyl separator can be improved by the increase of split ratio. The simulation also suggested that the Vorsyl separator may not function when the feeding velocity is smaller than a certain critical feeding in velocity. In addition, an increasing feeding velocity gives rise to increased pressure drop, however does not necessarily increase the separation efficiency...|$|E

This activity has been carried out in order to built a complete hybrid system emulator equipped with a 100 kW recuperated micro gas turbine, a cathodic vessel located between recuperator outlet and combustor inlet, and an anodic circuit based on the coupling of a single stage ejector with an anodic volume.

40|$|The {{acoustical}} behaviour of an elliptical chamber muffler {{having a}} side inlet and <b>side</b> <b>outlet</b> port is analyzed in this paper, wherein a uniform velocity piston source {{is assumed to}} model the 3 -D acoustic field in the elliptical chamber cavity. Towards this end, we consider the modal expansion of the acoustic pressure field in the elliptical cavity {{in terms of the}} angular and radial Mathieu func-tions, subjected to the rigid wall condition. Then, the Green's function due to the point source lo-cated on the side (curved) surface of the elliptical chamber is obtained. On integrating this function over the elliptical piston area on the curved surface of the elliptical chamber and subsequent divi-sion by the area of the elliptic piston, one obtains the acoustic pressure field due to the piston driven source which is equivalent to considering plane wave propagation in the side ports. Thus, one can obtain the acoustic pressure response functions, i. e., the impedance matrix (Z) parameters due to the sources (ports) located on the side surface, from which one may also obtain a progressive wave rep-resentation in terms of the scattering matrix (S). Finally, the acoustic performance of the muffler is evaluated in terms of the Transmission loss (TL) which is computed in terms of the scattering pa-rameters. The effect of the axial length of the muffler and the angular location of the ports on the TL characteristics is studied in detail. The acoustically long chambers show dominant axial plane wave propagation while the TL spectrum of short chambers indicates the dominance of the trans-versal modes. The 3 -D analytical results are compared with the 3 -D FEM simulations carried on a commercial software and are shown to be in an excellent agreement, thereby validating the analyti-cal procedure suggested in this work...|$|E

However, when broken down by treatment source, ACT use increased significantly among clients visiting SDSs. Unchanged ACT use overall, despite increases in QAACT availability, affordability and market share in the private sector, reflected a shift in treatment seeking towards private providers.
