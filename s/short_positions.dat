25|$|Inverse ETFs are {{constructed}} by using various derivatives {{for the purpose}} of profiting from a decline {{in the value of the}} underlying benchmark. It is a similar type of investment to holding several <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> or using a combination of advanced investment strategies to profit from falling prices. Many inverse ETFs use daily futures as their underlying benchmark.|$|E
2500|$|If the <b>short</b> <b>position</b> {{begins to}} move against the holder of the <b>short</b> <b>position</b> (i.e., {{the price of the}} {{security}} begins to rise), money is removed from the holder's cash balance and moved to their margin balance. [...] If short shares continue to rise in price, and the holder does not have sufficient funds in the cash account to cover the position, the holder begins to borrow on margin for this purpose, thereby accruing margin interest charges. [...] These are computed and charged just as for any other margin debit. Therefore, only margin accounts can be used to open a <b>short</b> <b>position.</b>|$|R
30|$|The buy {{signal to}} enter a long {{position}} (or to cover a prior <b>short</b> <b>position)</b> is generated when the RSI is in an oversold territory (RSI <  30). On the other hand, the sell signal {{to enter a}} <b>short</b> <b>position</b> (or to close a prior long position) is generated when the RSI is in an overbought territory (RSI >  70).|$|R
30|$|The buy {{signal to}} enter a long {{position}} (or to cover a prior <b>short</b> <b>position)</b> is generated when the MACD crosses above its own Signal Line (Bullish signal).

2500|$|Days to Cover (DTC) is a {{numerical}} term {{that describes the}} relationship between the number of shares in a given equity that has been legally short-sold and the number of days of typical trading that it would require to 'cover' all legal <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> outstanding. [...] For example, if there are ten million shares of XYZ Inc. that are currently legally short-sold and the average daily volume of XYZ shares traded each day is one million, it would require ten days of trading for all legal <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> to be covered (10 million / 1 million).|$|E
25|$|Since {{the risk}} of the inverse ETF and a fixed <b>short</b> <b>position</b> will differ {{significantly}} as the index drifts away from its initial value, differences in realized payoff have no clear interpretation. It may therefore be better to evaluate the performance assuming the index returns to the initial level. In that case an inverse ETF will always incur a volatility loss relative to the <b>short</b> <b>position.</b>|$|R

2500|$|A {{short sale}} {{may have a}} variety of objectives. [...] Speculators may sell short hoping to realize a profit on an {{instrument}} that appears overvalued, just as long investors or speculators hope to profit from a rise in the price of an instrument that appears undervalued. [...] Traders or fund managers may hedge a long position or a portfolio through one or more <b>short</b> <b>positions.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Short selling refers broadly to any {{transaction}} used by {{an investor}} {{to profit from}} the decline in price of a borrowed asset or financial instrument. However some <b>short</b> <b>positions,</b> for example those undertaken by means of derivatives contracts, are not technically short sales because no underlying asset is actually delivered upon the initiation of the position.

2500|$|The term [...] "hedge fund" [...] {{originated}} from the paired long and <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> {{that the first}} of these funds used to hedge market risk. Over time, the types and nature of the hedging concepts expanded, as did the different types of investment vehicles. Today, hedge funds engage in a diverse range of markets and strategies and employ a wide variety of financial instruments and risk management techniques.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{the market}} opens {{on the first}} day of trading a new futures contract, there is a {{specification}} but no actual contracts exist. Futures contracts are not issued like other securities, but are [...] "created" [...] whenever Open interest increases; that is, when one party first buys (goes long) a contract from another party (who goes short). Contracts are also [...] "destroyed" [...] in the opposite manner whenever Open interest decreases because traders resell to reduce their long positions or rebuy to reduce their <b>short</b> <b>positions.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Within {{global macro}} strategies, there are further sub-strategies {{including}} [...] "systematic diversified", {{in which the}} fund trades in diversified markets, or [...] "systematic currency", in which the fund trades in currency markets. Other sub-strategies include those employed by commodity trading advisors (CTAs), where the fund trades in futures (or options) in commodity markets or in swaps. This {{is also known as}} a [...] "managed future fund". CTAs trade in commodities (such as gold) and financial instruments, including stock indices. [...] They also take both long and <b>short</b> <b>positions,</b> allowing them to make profit in both market upswings and downswings.|$|E

50|$|The {{only option}} the {{underwriting}} syndicate has for closing a naked <b>short</b> <b>position</b> is to purchase {{shares in the}} aftermarket. Unlike shares sold short related to the greenshoe option, the underwriting syndicate risks losing money by engaging in naked short sales. If the offering is popular and the price rises above the original offering price, the syndicate may {{have no choice but}} to close a naked <b>short</b> <b>position</b> by purchasing shares in the aftermarket at a price higher than that for which they had sold the shares. On the other hand, if the price of the offering falls below the original offer price, a naked <b>short</b> <b>position</b> gives the syndicate greater power to exert upward pressure on the issue than the greenshoe option alone, and this position then becomes profitable to the underwriting syndicate.|$|R

2500|$|Short sellers must {{be aware}} of the {{potential}} for a short squeeze. [...] When the price of a stock rises significantly, some people who are shorting the stock cover their positions to limit their losses (this may occur in an automated way if the short sellers had stop-loss orders in place with their brokers); others may be forced to close their position to meet a margin call; others may be forced to cover, subject to the terms under which they borrowed the stock, if the person who lent the stock wishes to sell and take a profit. [...] Since covering their positions involves buying shares, the short squeeze causes an ever further rise in the stock's price, which in turn may trigger additional covering. [...] Because of this, most short sellers restrict their activities to heavily traded stocks, and they {{keep an eye on the}} [...] "short interest" [...] levels of their short investments. [...] Short interest is defined as the total number of shares that have been legally sold short, but not covered. A short squeeze can be deliberately induced. [...] This can happen when large investors (such as companies or wealthy individuals) notice significant <b>short</b> <b>positions,</b> and buy many shares, with the intent of selling the position at a profit to the short sellers, who may be panicked by the initial uptick or who are forced to cover their <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> to avoid margin calls.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 October 2008, Porsche {{revealed}} {{its plan}} to assume control of VW. As of that day, it held 42.6% of Volkswagen's ordinary shares and stock options on another 31.5%. Combined {{with the state of}} Lower Saxony's 20.1% stake, this left only 5.8% of shares on the market—mostly with index funds that could not legally sell. Hedge funds desperate to cover their <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> forced Volkswagen stock above one thousand euros per share, briefly making it the world's largest company by market capitalisation on 28 October 2008. By January 2009, Porsche had a 50.76% holding in Volkswagen AG, although the [...] "Volkswagen Law" [...] prevented it from taking control of the company.|$|E
2500|$|Within {{directional}} strategies, {{there are}} a number of sub-strategies. [...] "Emerging markets" [...] funds focus on emerging markets such as China and India, whereas [...] "sector funds" [...] specialize in specific areas including technology, healthcare, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, energy and basic materials. Funds using a [...] "fundamental growth" [...] strategy invest in companies with more earnings growth than the overall stock market or relevant sector, while funds using a [...] "fundamental value" [...] strategy invest in undervalued companies. Funds that use quantitative and Financial signal processing techniques for equity trading are described as using a [...] "quantitative directional" [...] strategy. Funds using a [...] "short bias" [...] strategy take advantage of declining equity prices using <b>short</b> <b>positions.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{practical}} terms, [...] "going short" [...] can {{be considered}} {{the opposite of the}} conventional practice of [...] "going long", whereby an investor profits from an increase in the price of the asset. Mathematically, the return from a <b>short</b> <b>position</b> is equivalent to that of owning (being [...] "long") a negative amount of the instrument. [...] (Nevertheless, one main discrepancy in the short against a long position is that the <b>short</b> <b>position</b> must exclude the dividends paid, if any.) ...|$|R
40|$|The Chicago Board of Trade Treasury Bond Futures Contract {{allows the}} <b>short</b> <b>position</b> several {{delivery}} options {{as to when}} and with which bond the contract will be settled. The timing option allows the <b>short</b> <b>position</b> to choose any business day in the delivery month to make delivery. In addition, the contract settlement price is locked in at 2 : 00 p. m. when the futures market closes, despite the facts that the <b>short</b> <b>position</b> need not declare an intent to settle the contract until 8 : 00 p. m. and that trading in Treasury bonds car, occur all day in dealer markets. If bond prices change significantly between 2 : 00 and 8 : 00 p. m., the short has the option of settling the contract at a favorable 2 : 00 p. m. price. This phenomenon, which recurs on every trading day of the delivery month, creates a sequence of 6 -hour put options for the <b>short</b> <b>position</b> which has been dubbed the "wild card option. " This paper presents avaluation model for the wild card option and computes estimates {{of the value of}} that option, as well as rules for its optimal exercise. ...|$|R

2500|$|An {{investor}} or speculator may “buy protection” {{to hedge}} {{the risk of}} default on a bond or other debt instrument, regardless of whether such investor or speculator holds an interest in or bears any risk of loss relating to such bond or debt instrument. In this way, a CDS is similar to credit insurance, although CDS {{are not subject to}} regulations governing traditional insurance. Also, investors can buy and sell protection without owning debt of the reference entity. These [...] "naked credit default swaps" [...] allow traders to speculate on the creditworthiness of reference entities. CDSs can be used to create synthetic long and <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> in the reference entity. [...] Naked CDS constitute most of the market in CDS. [...] In addition, CDSs can also be used in capital structure arbitrage.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2008 {{financial}} crisis, critics {{argued that}} investors taking large <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> in struggling financial firms like Lehman Brothers, HBOS and Morgan Stanley created {{instability in the}} stock market and placed additional downward pressure on prices. In response, a number of countries introduced restrictive regulations on short-selling in 2008 and 2009. Naked short selling is the practice of short-selling a tradable asset without first borrowing the security or ensuring that the security can be borrowed [...] it was this practice that was commonly restricted. Investors argued that it was the weakness of financial institutions, not short-selling, that drove stocks to fall. In September 2008, the Securities Exchange Commission in the United States abruptly banned short sales, primarily in financial stocks, to protect companies under siege {{in the stock market}}. That ban expired several weeks later as regulators determined the ban was not stabilizing the price of stocks.|$|E
2500|$|Following GJR's {{results and}} {{mounting}} empirical evidence of EMH anomalies, academics {{began to move}} away from the CAPM towards risk factor models such as the Fama-French 3 factor model. It should be noted that these risk factor models are not properly founded on economic theory (whereas CAPM is founded on Modern Portfolio Theory), but rather, constructed with long-short portfolios in response to the observed empirical EMH anomalies. For instance, the [...] "small-minus-big" [...] (SMB) factor in the FF3 factor model is simply a portfolio that holds long positions on small stocks and <b>short</b> <b>positions</b> on large stocks to mimic the risks small stocks face. These risk factors are said to represent some aspect or dimension of undiversifiable systematic risk which should be compensated with higher expected returns. Additional popular risk factors include the [...] "HML" [...] value factor (Fama and French, 1993); [...] "MOM" [...] momentum factor (Carhart, 1997); [...] "ILLIQ" [...] liquidity factors (Amihud et al. 2002).|$|E
30|$|When the {{relative}} {{performance of the}} <b>short</b> <b>position</b> is better {{than that of the}} long position, this strategy is going to be profitable regardless of stock market regimes. So, a speculator who pairs a long position in a retail stock with a <b>short</b> <b>position</b> in a rival stock or an index ETF could end up with a profit. Pairs trading could be viewed alternatively as a mechanism to hedge both sector and market risks. When there is a financial crisis, two stocks both decline in value; but then the pair trade would result to a gain on the <b>short</b> <b>position</b> and an offsetting loss on the long position. This will yield a profit close to zero in spite of the large market movement. It is clear that this is a self-funding strategy as short sale proceeds may be utilised in creating the long position.|$|R
