40|$|The {{influence}} of continuous (non-fragmented) and reticulate (fragmented) bed type and plant architecture on the species richness, abundance and assemblage composition of motile macroinvertebrates {{associated with the}} seagrass Posidonia oceanica was investigated at 3 different spatial scales (10 <b>s</b> of <b>metres</b> [‘small’], 100 <b>s</b> of <b>metres</b> [‘medium’] and kilometres [‘large’]). Univariate and multivariate analyses did not identify {{significant differences in the}} attributes of macroinverte- brate assemblages between the 2 P. oceanica bed types over the 3 spatial scales considered. On the other hand, significant spatial variation in macroinvertebrate attributes was detected at the large spa- tial scale. Results of univariate regression and multivariate correlation analysis consistently indicated significant relationships between attributes of the macroinvertebrate assemblages and epiphyte bio- mass at the large spatial scale. Although less consistent, significant relationships were also detected between attributes of the macroinvertebrate assemblages, and mean sediment grain size, total organic carbon in sediment and shoot biomass at the large and medium spatial scales. The findings indicate that naturally fragmented and non-fragmented P. oceanica beds have similar habitat charac- teristics for the associated macroinvertebrates and that local factors, which influence seagrass bed architecture and particularly epiphyte load, have greater influence on the seagrass fauna. Data from the present study support the notion that fragmented seagrass beds should receive the same attention as non-fragmented ones with regard to habitat conservation and protection. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Variation in {{recruitment}} {{is known}} to affect species demography and population dynamics. There is scant information, however, on how variation in recruitment influences community composition and processes. In the rocky intertidal, mytilid mussels have long been recognised as an important foundation species which can influence {{the dynamics of the}} entire community. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the effects of recruitment and post-recruitment processes on structure and dynamics of mussel populations, as well as the effect of mussels as a habitat engineering on community of rocky shores, the understanding of how variation in mussel recruitment might affect community level structure and processes remains unclear. In this Ph. D. research project I used the mussel Mytilus edulis L. as a model species to investigate the effects of variation in recruitment and post-recruitment processes on adult abundance and distribution on rocky shores around the Isle of Anglesey, North Wales, an area known for intense spatial variation in recruitment. I also examined how community composition of key taxa varied in relation to the presence of mussel-modified habitat. Particular emphasis was placed on how mussel-modified habitat influences the abundance and distribution of the dominant canopy-forming fucoid algae Fucus serratus L. which occupies a similar position on the low shore as mussel beds. Recruitment appeared to be a determinant of adult abundance and distribution at the mesoscale (1000 <b>s</b> of <b>metres)</b> but not at the smaller, within-shore scale (10 <b>s</b> of <b>metres).</b> The relative abundance of adult mussels among three geographically defined coastlines of Anglesey (west, north, and east) reflected the abundance of the recruits. The absence of mussel beds on the west coast of the island can be explained by a combination of low levels of recruitment, poor food supply, probably poor environmental condition, and intense predation. At the community level, community composition varied according to the existence of mussel-modified habitat at different scales. The difference was significant at 1000 <b>s</b> of <b>metre</b> scale, significant in one of the two years studied at 100 <b>s</b> of <b>metre</b> scale, and not significant at 10 s of centimetre scale. Abundance of sessile taxa on primary substrates was lower where mussel habitat dominates, while abundance of mobile species except limpets was higher in the presence of mussel habitat. For mussel-fucoid interactions, mussel habitat influenced fucoids of different life-history phases in different ways. A negative effect of mussel-modified habitat on fucoids was profound in adults but the effect was context-dependent in juveniles and can be positive at settlement. There was a greater number of large fertile fucoids growing directly attached to rock than on mussel shells. This suggests that mussel dominated habitat may {{have a significant impact on}} reproductive output in fucoid populations as the abundance of reproducing thalli was reduced. Overall, a series of surveys and experiments in my thesis demonstrates that recruitment of the foundation species M. edulis is an important determinant for community composition on rocky shore...|$|R
40|$|Variation in {{the level}} of {{settlement}} and recruitment in the intertidal barnacle Semibalanus balanoides was studied using a hierarchical sampling programme. The effect of three spatial scales, 10 <b>s</b> of <b>metres</b> (sites), 1000 <b>s</b> of <b>metres</b> (shores) and 100 s of kilometres (locations), was determined. The largest spatial scale represented the distance between four widely separated locations, Sweden, the Isle of Man, SW Ireland and SW England, covering {{a large part of the}} range of S. balanoides in Europe. Temporal variation was determined by comparison between two years, 1997 and 1998. The settlement period of S. balanoides varied in length and timing, being earlier and shorter at the most northerly location, Sweden. The duration of settlement showed little difference among shores within locations, but the pattern of settlement did vary. Estimates of total settlement throughout the settlement period and of recruitment at the end of this period both showed substantial variation among locations which was dependent on the year of study. There was little consistency in the ranking of locations between the two years. Recruitment showed significant variation at the lower spatial scales of shore and site. In addition, examination of variance components showed a high degree of variation between replicates within sites in 1997. There was a significant relationship between settlement and recruitment at three of the four locations. Across all locations variation in settlement explained between 29 and 99 % of variation in recruitment. However, locations showed distinct differences {{in the level}} of post-settlement survival...|$|R

40|$|Spatial {{variability}} in the population dynamics of the intertidal acorn barnacle Semibalanus balanoides was investigated using a hierarchical sampling programme. Variability {{in a number of}} population parameters (size distribution, density, % cover, absolute growth and instantaneous mortality) was determined separately for new recruits and adults over 3 spatial scales. Three locations, SW Ireland, the Isle of Man and the west coast of Sweden, which cover {{a large part of the}} European range of this species, were selected to investigate variability over a large spatial scale (100 s of kilometres). Two smaller scales, shore (1000 <b>s</b> of <b>metres)</b> and site (10 <b>s</b> of <b>metres)</b> nested within each location were also used. In addition, temporal variation over two 6 mo periods was also examined in the Isle of Man and Ireland. Most variability for all population parameters occurred over the largest spatial scale (location). This was a direct result of differences between Sweden and the other 2 locations, the Isle of Man and Ireland, which showed highly similar levels of all population parameters. The population of S, balanoides at the Swedish location was characterised by high growth rates, large size, high levels of mortality and a large turnover of bare space. At the spatial scale 'shore', only 1 population parameter, the growth rate of recruits, showed variability. At the smallest scale of 'site', all parameters showed significant variability except growth rate of adults. Calculation of variance components showed that differences between replicates (spatial scale: < 0. 5 m) accounted for little of the overall variability, in general less than the scales of site and shore. Examination of temporal variability over two 6 mo periods revealed no difference between time periods and no significant interaction between temporal and spatial scales, Thus, there was consistency of spatial variability over time. The potential causes of {{variability in}} population parameters of S, balanoides at different spatial scales and the implications for future studies are discussed...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{examine the}} {{correspondence}} between high latitude ionospheric scintillation measurements made at 250 MHz with {{the occurrence of}} 10 MHz HF coherent radar backscatter, on 13 and 14 December 2002.

Conversely, when the radar indicates that backscatter is observed away from the intersection point due to movements of the auroral zone, the observed scintillation is low. This suggests that scintillation is highly location-dependent, being enhanced in the auroral zone and being lower at sub-auroral latitudes.

However, {{little is known about}} spatial variation in POM supply to the abyssal seafloor, which is frequently assumed to be homogenous.

Here, we show a significant increase in seabed POM % cover (by ~ 1. 05 times), and a large significant increase in megafauna biomass (by ~ 2. 5 times), on abyssal hill terrain in comparison to the surrounding plain. These differences are substantially greater than predicted by current models linking water depth to POM supply or benthic biomass. Our observed variations in POM % cover (phytodetritus), megafauna biomass, sediment total organic carbon and total nitrogen, sedimentology, and benthic boundary layer turbidity, all appear to be consistent with topographically enhanced current speeds driving these enhancements.

The Porcupine Bank exhibits numerous giant carbonate mounds (up to 100 <b>s</b> of <b>metres</b> in height) that occur predominantly, although not exclusively, on topographic ridges. The results revealed that, although these ridges have a tectonic origin, contemporaneous activity is typified by erosion due to strong hydrodynamic controls. The carbonate mounds are colonized by a variety of suspension feeders and associated fauna including framework-building corals (e. g., Lophelia pertusa and Madrepora oculata) although dense coral reef-like fauna coverage is not evident at present. The ecology of the carbonate mounds varied widely. Sessile megafauna, such as sponges, gorgonians and framework-building corals (e. g., Lophelia pertusa), were abundant on some of the carbonate mounds. Other mounds were relatively barren and appeared to be undergoing a natural senescence, with a much lower biomass of megafauna than is typical of shallow-water coral reefs.

Recruitment was highest during the winter with erect and encrusting algae colonising free space in all plots. While full fences around plots led to a higher percentage cover of algae, cover in partially fenced and open plots fluctuated at different times and between sites. Free space availability was greatest during summer, due to the seasonal die-off of species and negligible recruitment, as new species were unable to survive the extreme physical conditions during this period.
