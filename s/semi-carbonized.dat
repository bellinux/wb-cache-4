40|$|Reducing the use {{of fossil}} fuel {{is one of the}} prime tasks for {{preventing}} climate change. The worst fossil fuel in this regard is coal, which is the largest CO 2 -emitting fossil fuel in terms of weight. Although decreasing {{the use of}} coal is difficult because of its increasing demand in worldwide, there is still a possibility of effectively reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by substituting biomass, even for a subset of coal. One way to reduce the use of coal is to implement co-firing of biomass with coal at coal thermal power stations. In this study, the business impact of GHG reduction from <b>semi-carbonized</b> fuel produced by co-firing woody biomass with coal in thermal power plants is evaluated from the perspective of life cycles, using the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. The case study area is the central region of Wakayama prefecture, Japan. In this study, a new business is considered whose operations would co-fire the woody biomass with coal. A life cycle inventory (LCI) analysis and a life cycle impact assessment are conducted to evaluate the GHG emissions, taking into account processes such as cutting timber, manufacturing <b>semi-carbonized</b> fuel, and co-firing with coal. LCI data was collected and calculated {{on the basis of the}} feasibility study and literature survey. The spatial distribution of the woody biomass was ascertained using a geographic information system, and the location of several facilities and a road transportation network were determined. Results showed that an annual reduction in GHG emissions of approximately 46, 700 Â tonnes in the case study area is possible if the business is executed. The environmental impact taking into account climate change, acidification and land use was also reduced. As the result, this business is in fact advantageous to reduce GHG emissions as well as the environmental impact.

40|$|AbstractIn this study, the {{activated}} carbons (ACs) {{were prepared}} from guava seeds via two stages activation. The dried guava seeds were <b>semi-carbonized</b> at 300 °C for 1 h, {{and then the}} carbonized samples were impregnated with zinc chloride (ZnCl 2). The ZnCl 2 : sample impregnation ratios (w/w) were altered from 1 : 1 to 5 : 1. The ACs were characterized by the yield percentage, ash content, moisture content, pH value, adsorption quality of 2, 4 -dichlorophenol (2, 4 -DCP) and surface functional groups. The surface area of the best produced AC 3 {{was found to be}} 919. 40 m 2 g− 1. It was found that AC 3 had highest 2, 4 -DCP adsorption capacity, which was 20. 9 mgg− 1. The 2, 4 -DCP adsorption kinetic of prepared AC 3 was pseudo-second order with correlation value of 0. 995. In addition, the 2, 4 -DCP adsorption capacity of AC 3 was fitted to the Langmuir model with correlation coefficient value of 0. 977, indicating that chemisorption was a major contributor to the adsorption process...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} of activated carbon prepared from kenaf fiber (KF) to remove copper (II) from aqueous effluents was investigated. The fibers were first <b>semi-carbonized,</b> then impregnated with potassium hydroxide (KOH) and finally activated by using carbon dioxide (CO 2) gas to produce activated carbon. Pore structure and physical {{characteristics of the}} prepared kenaf fiber activated carbon (KFAC) were determined. Adsorption studies for divalent copper (Cu) ions were carried out to delineate the effect of contact time, temperature, pH and initial metal ion concentration on equilibrium adsorption capacity. The experimental data followed pseudo-second-order kinetics and Elovich Model than pseudo-first-order. Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin models were implemented to analyze the parameters for adsorption at 30 °C, 50 °C and 70 °C. Thermodynamic parameters such as ΔG o, ΔH o and ΔS o which represent Gibbs free energy, enthalpy and entropy, respectively, were evaluated. It was concluded that activated carbon from kenaf fiber (KFAC) {{can be used as}} an efficient adsorbent for removal of Cu (II) from synthetic wastewater. © 2012 Korean Institute of Chemical Engineers, Seoul, Korea...|$|E
40|$|Four {{activated}} carbons {{were produced}} by two-stage process as followings; semi-carbonization of indigenous biomass waste, i. e. cotton stalks, followed by chemical activation with KOH under various activation temperatures and chemical ratios of KOH to <b>semi-carbonized</b> cotton stalks (CCS). The surface area, {{total pore volume}} and average pore diameter were evaluated by N 2 adsorption at 77 K. The surface morphology and oxygen functional groups were determined by SEM and FTIR, respectively. Batch equilibrium and kinetic {{studies were carried out}} by using a basic dye, methylene blue as a probe molecule to evaluate the adsorption capacity and mechanism over the produced carbons. The obtained activated carbon (CCS- 1 K 800) exhibited highly microporous structure with high surface area of 950 m 2 /g, total pore volume of 0. 423 cm 3 /g and average pore diameter of 17. 8 Å. The isotherm data fitted well to the Langmuir isotherm with monolayer adsorption capacity of 222 mg/g for CCS- 1 K 800. The kinetic data obtained at different concentrations were analyzed using a pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order and intraparticle diffusion equations. The pseudo-second-order model fitted better for kinetic removal of MB dye. The results indicate that such laboratory carbons could be employed as low cost alternative to commercial carbons in wastewater treatment...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{charcoal}} production, firewood sourcing and over-dependence on {{the national}} grid for electricity are associated with high greenhouse gas emissions relative to other common energy options. However, {{there have been few}} attempts to analyze the potential of cogeneration and briquetting as favourable energy options for climate change mitigation. The possibility of utilizing abundant wood residues to produce energy for domestic and industrial application through co-generation and sawdust briquetting was assessed. Annual residues generated in the three mills studied ranged from 19, 230 m 3 to 32, 610 m 3. Annual output of <b>semi-carbonized</b> and carbonized sawdust briquette from the briquette factory studied was 1400 tonnes. Heating values of the wood species ranged from 8. 2 to 20. 3 MJ/kg. Power requirements for the mills, necessary for sizing co-generation units were derived from their monthly electricity bills. Power ratings for co-generation units were specified between 400 kWe to 2000 kWe with heat to power ratios of 19 to 21. The energy generated could be used to produce electrical power and reduce dependency {{on the national}} grid. Conversion of sawdust in the briquette factory potentially contributes a saving of 5, 600 tonnes of trees/year that would have been cut from the forest. Thus, adoption of co-generation and sawdust briquetting nationwide could be of immense benefit to the country in terms of climate change mitigation...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{the removal}} of 2, 4 -dichlorophenol (2, 4 -DCP) from aqueous {{solutions}} was performed using coconut shell activated carbon prepared by a two-stage self-generated atmosphere method. Coconut shell was first <b>semi-carbonized</b> at 300  °C for an hour followed by chemical activation with zinc chloride (ZnCl 2) as activating agent at 500  °C for 2  h. The effect of impregnation ratio on the {{physical and chemical properties}} of activated carbons (ACs) was studied. The morphology and surface chemistry of the prepared carbons were characterized using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) respectively. The percentage of yield for the prepared AC was found to be in the range of 26. 40 – 38. 82  %. AC registered the highest adsorption capacity and was used in subsequent batch adsorption studies consisting of parameters such as initial concentration, adsorbent dosage and solution pH. The maximum surface area of the best produced AC was recorded as 1482  m 2 g - 1. The adsorption capacity was found to increase in proportional to the initial concentration and adsorbent dosage, while acidic solution pH was more favourable for the adsorption of 2, 4 -DCP by the prepared AC. The equilibrium time for the adsorption of 20  mg L - 1 of 2, 4 -DCP on 0. 5  g of AC was achieved in 180  min. Adsorption isotherms such as Langmuir, Freundlich and Temkin isotherm models were employed to examine the experimental isotherms while the reaction kinetic data was analysed using pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order and intraparticle diffusion model. The 2, 4 -DCP adsorption results fitted best in the Freundlich isotherm as indicated by the high correlation coefficient value (R 2  >  0. 9949) while the adsorption kinetic fitted to the pseudo second-order model (R 2  >  0. 9621).
