A squint was added {{at the same time}} to give her a view into the chancel towards the altar and to allow her to receive Communion. Another known occupant of the cell was Prior Robert, who died there in 1285. The squint was later blocked, but in about 1900 it was uncovered. Some lancet windows were added in the nave in the late 13th century, and in the 14th century the chancel received two new window openings.|$|E

40|$|Cell walls from flesh, {{parenchyma}} <b>cells,</b> <b>stone</b> <b>cells</b> {{and skin}} were isolated from ripe and overripe Pyrus communis L. cv “De Cloche” using the phenol-buffer method. Pear polysaccharides were solubilized from cell walls by sequential extractions with aqueous solutions of ammonium oxalate, Na 2 CO 3, and increasing concentration of NaOH, to explore overripening impact. Cell walls were also differentiated using MIR spectral data. <b>Stone</b> <b>cells</b> contained {{high levels of}} xylose and lignin while parenchyma cells had high levels of glucose, uronic acids and arabinose. Sequential extractions revealed that pear pectins had highly branched rhamnogalacturonans and were extremely methylated. Xylans were the main hemicellulose especially for <b>stone</b> <b>cells.</b> Cellulose represented {{about half of all}} cell walls. This heterogeneous composition of pear affected differently cell wall evolutions and properties. Thus, overripening involved a decrease in arabinose and a loss of pectic side chains mostly from parenchyma cells. Changes in hemicellulose and cellulose were minor...|$|R

40|$|Rauvolfia {{belongs to}} the family Apocynaceae. Rauvolfia tetraphylla L. is an {{endangered}} evergreen woody shrub and it is economically important medicinal plant {{because of the presence}} of various alkaloids. Because of a wide use and demand for this plant in the trade, it has been banned to be exported, which has increased the sort of adulterations made to it. To avoid this we need a correct identification of drug. So here an attempt has been made for the correct identification through its morphological and pharmacognostical parameters of the root stem and leaves. Study revealed the presence of <b>stone</b> <b>cells</b> and twin prismatic crystals characteristically present in the root. Presence of non-lignified fiber in cortex and <b>stone</b> <b>cells</b> in pith is characteristic to stem where as in leaf, parasitic stomata in lower epidermis and trichomes in both epidermis...|$|R
40|$|Background: Hydnocarpus laurifolia (Dennst) Sleummer. of Flacourtiaceae {{family is}} one {{important}} herbal resource {{widely used in}} the treatment of intestinal worms, helminthiasis, infected wounds, skin diseases, fever, piles, wounds and inflammation. Different extracts of this plant have been studied for pharmacological activities such as anti-hyperglycemic activity, anti-hyperlipidemic activity etc. Though it is an important plant, till date, no reported pharmacognostical data are available on seeds. Aim: The present study is aimed towards evaluating in detail pharmacognostical characteristics of the seeds of H. laurifolia (Dennst) Sleummer. Materials and Methods: Macroscopic and microscopic pharmacognostical characters of seeds were noted by following standard methods. Results: Pharmacognostical evaluation of seed shows the presence of crystalline masses of calcium carbonate, nonpitted sclereids and <b>stone</b> <b>cells,</b> spherical <b>stone</b> <b>cells,</b> aleurone grains, and fragment of tegmen. Conclusion: The current work appears to be first of its kind and can be considered as reference standards for future studies...|$|R
50|$|They {{are small}} bundles of sclerenchyma tissue in plants that form durable layers, {{such as the}} cores of apples and the gritty texture of pears (Pyrus communis). Sclereids are {{variable}} in shape. The cells can be isodiametric, prosenchymatic, forked or elaborately branched. They can be grouped into bundles, can form complete tubes located at the periphery or can occur as single cells or small groups of cells within parenchyma tissues. But compared with most fibres, sclereids are relatively short. Characteristic examples are brachysclereids or the <b>stone</b> <b>cells</b> (called <b>stone</b> <b>cells</b> because of their hardness) of pears and quinces (Cydonia oblonga) {{and those of the}} shoot of the wax plant (Hoya carnosa).

40|$|Rauvolfia sellowii Müll. Arg. (Apocynaceae), a Brazilian native tree rich in indole alkaloids, {{is known}} as "pau-pra-tudo" and popularly used as hypocholesterolemic, hypoglycemic and antihypertensive. The aim of this work was to study the anatomy of the young stems and stem barks of this {{medicinal}} plant, in order {{to contribute to the}} identification of the species as a drug. The plant material was fixed and prepared according to standard microtechniques. The young stems have remaining epidermis, but a suberified peridermis is evident. The phellogen is located in the cortical region, forming suber externally. Underneath the phellogen, lies the phelloderm and collenchymatic region. In the cortex, there are numerous laticifers and some fibers. There is an incomplete sclerenchymatic sheath, consisting of several groups of fibers and <b>stone</b> <b>cells.</b> The stem has internal phloem ordered as isolated groups side by side. Numerous laticifers, calcium oxalate crystals, idioblasts and amyloplasts are found in the cortex, phloem, xylem and pith. The stem bark has many layers of suber and cortical parenchyma, a sheath composed of fibers and <b>stone</b> <b>cells</b> totally lignified, and external phloem. These anatomical characteristic, taken together, can be used as quality control parameters for this species...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The present {{work was}} carried out to perform the morphoanatomical and {{physicochemical}} evaluation of Casuarina equisetifolia L. stem bark. Method: The pharmacognostic {{studies were carried out}} in terms of organoleptic, macroscopic, microscopic, fluorescence analysis and physicochemical parameters. Results: The bark consists of channelled, curved, slightly quilled, usually 0. 2 – 0. 8  cm thick, lenticellate pieces with outer surface ash-grey to greyish-brown and internal surface light yellow to deep dirty brown coloured having no odour and astringent taste. The main microscopic characteristics of the bark include phellem (2 – 5 or more layers of cork), phellogen (3 – 5 layered) followed by 12 – 18 layered phelloderm. Other important microscopic components observed include phloem parenchyma, phloem fibre and <b>stone</b> <b>cells.</b> Stem bark powder showed thick walled oval to polygonal cork cells, hexagonal phelloderm cells, rectangular thin walled cortex cells, thick walled elongated phloem fibres, lignified <b>stone</b> <b>cells</b> and rhomboidal crystals of calcium oxalate. Further, physicochemical analysis of the bark power showed loss on drying, total ash, water soluble ash, acid insoluble ash and sulphated ash as 2. 3, 5. 0, 1. 6, 0. 7 and 5. 7 % w/w respectively. The alcohol and water soluble extractives values of the stem bark were 17. 10 and 11. 0 % w/w respectively.

5000|$|Sclerenchyma cells - Sclerenchyma cells (from the Greek skleros, hard) {{are hard}} and tough cells with a {{function}} in mechanical support. They are of two broad types - sclereids or <b>stone</b> <b>cells</b> and fibres. The cells develop an extensive secondary cell wall that is laid {{down on the}} inside of the primary cell wall. The secondary wall is impregnated with lignin, making it hard and impermeable to water. Thus, these cells cannot survive for long' as they cannot exchange sufficient material to maintain active metabolism. Sclerenchyma cells are typically dead at functional maturity, and the cytoplasm is missing, leaving an empty central cavity.|$|R
