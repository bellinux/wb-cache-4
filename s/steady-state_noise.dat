50|$|Although Scharf et al.’s (1993, 1994, 1997) {{experiments}} {{failed to}} produce any clear differences in the basic psychophysical characteristics of hearing (other than the detection of unexpected sounds), many other studies using both animals and humans have implicated the OCB in listening-in-noise tasks using more complex stimuli. In constant BGN, rhesus monkeys with intact OCBs have been observed to perform better in vowel discrimination tasks than those without (Dewson, 1968). In cats, an intact OCB is associated with better vowel identification (Heinz et al., 1998), sound localisation (May et al., 2004), and intensity discrimination (May and McQuone, 1995). All of these studies were performed in constant BGN. In humans, speech-in-noise discrimination measurements have been performed on individuals who had undergone unilateral vestibular neurectomy (resulting in OCB sectioning). Giraud et al. (1997) observed a small advantage in the healthy ear over the operated ear for phoneme recognition and speech intelligibility in BGN. Scharf et al. (1988) had previously investigated the role of auditory attention during speech perception, and suggested that speech-in-noise discrimination is assisted by attentional focus on frequency regions. In 2000, Zeng et al., reported that vestibular neurectomy did not directly affect pure-tone thresholds or intensity discrimination, confirming earlier findings of Scharf et al. 1994; 1997. For the listening-in-noise tasks, they observed a number of discrepancies between the healthy and operated ear. Consistent with the earlier findings of May and McQuone (1995), intensity discrimination in noise was observed to be slightly worse in the ear without olivocochlear bundle (OCB) input. However, Zeng et al.’s main finding related to the “overshoot” effect, which {{was found to be}} significantly reduced (~50%) in the operated ears. This effect was first observed by Zwicker (1965), and was characterised as an increased detection threshold of a tone when it is presented {{at the onset of the}} noise compared to when it is presented in constant, <b>steady-state</b> <b>noise.</b> Zeng et al. proposed that this finding is consistent with MOCS-evoked antimasking; that is, MOCS-evoked antimasking being absent at the onset of noise however becoming active during <b>steady-state</b> <b>noise.</b> This theory was supported by the time course of MOC activation; being similar to the time course of the overshoot effect (Zwicker, 1965), as well as the overshoot effect being disrupted in subjects with sensorineural hearing loss, for whom the MOCS would be most likely ineffectual (Bacon and Takahashi, 1992).|$|E
5000|$|The U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) {{specifies}} that {{engineering controls}} are preferential when reducing the noise levels at the source. The use of hearing protective devices {{is considered an}} [...] "interim protective measure" [...] while engineering controls are developed. The goal of these controls is to reduce ambient <b>steady-state</b> <b>noise</b> levels to 85 dBA regardless of TWA exposure and to reduce impulse noise levels to below 140 dBP. The DOD requires that personnel be entered into a hearing conservation program when continuous snd intermittent noise levels ale grs {{greater than or equal}} to 85 dBA TWA, when impulse SPL are at or in excess of 140 dBP, or when the personnel is exposed to ultrasonic frequencies. The DOD integrates all sound levels between 80 dBA to a minimum of 130 dBA when determining an individual or representative noise dose. When used, hearing protectors must be capable of attenuating worker noise exposure below 85 dBA TWA. Hearing protection is required to be carried by personnel who work in designated noise areas, such as those exposed to gunfire or ordnance tests and Service musicians. The DOD defines a significant threshold shift as a 10 dB average decrease in hearing thresholds at 2,000, 3,000, and 4,000 Hz in either ear, with no age corrections. It is further specified that a shift in 15 dB at 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, or 4,000 Hz is an early warning sign for an STS; follow-up retraining is required in this case. (DOD Instruction 6055.12).|$|E

Acoustic environment was found to have little effect upon physical predictive measures and ratings of perceived noisiness were little affected by the acoustic environment in which they were obtained.

This study examined performance on a spectral discrimination task and compared it to speech perception in noise. An adaptive procedure was used to determine the spectral-ripple density that subjects could discriminate. A closed-set, forced-choice adaptive procedure was used to determine speech reception thresholds for words in two-talker babble and in speech-shaped, <b>steady-state</b> <b>noise.</b> Spectral-ripple thresholds (ripples/octave) were significantly correlated with speech reception thresholds (dB SNR) in noise for 29 cochlear implant users (r[*]=[*]− 0. 55, p[*]=[*] 0. 002 in two-talker babble; r[*]=[*]− 0. 62, p[*]=[*] 0. 0004 in <b>steady-state</b> <b>noise),</b> demonstrating that better spectral resolution was associated with better speech perception in noise.

40|$|ObjectiveTo {{characterize}} {{the performance of}} hearing protection devices in impulsive-noise conditions and to compare various protection metrics between impulsive and <b>steady-state</b> <b>noise</b> sources with different characteristics. DesignHearing protectors were measured per the impulsive test methods of ANSI/ASA S 12. 42 - 2010. Protectors were measured with impulses generated by both an acoustic shock tube and an AR- 15 rifle. The measured data were analyzed for impulse peak insertion loss (IPIL) and impulsive spectral insertion loss (ISIL). These impulsive measurements were compared to insertion loss measured with <b>steady-state</b> <b>noise</b> and with real-ear attenuation at threshold (REAT). Study SampleTested devices included a foam earplug, a level-dependent earplug, and an electronic sound-restoration earmuff. ResultsIPIL for a given protector varied between measurements with the two impulse noise sources, but ISIL agreed between the two sources. The level-dependent earplug demonstrated level-dependent effects both in IPIL and ISIL. Steady-state insertion loss and REAT measurements tended to provide a conservative estimate of the impulsively-measured attenuation. ConclusionsMeasurements of IPIL depend strongly on the source used to measure them, especially for hearing protectors with less attenuation at low frequencies.

40|$|The major nongenetic {{causes of}} {{sensorineural hearing loss}} are {{exposure}} to noise, aging, ototoxic drugs, viral and bacterial infections, and interactions between these factors. Regarding exposure to continuous noise, the data base from laboratory and field studies indicates that a risk of hearing loss is present when noise levels exceed 75 - 80 dBA. As noise level, duration and number of exposures increase so does risk. The data base for other forms of noise (intermittent, impact) is not as established. Risk of hearing loss due to impulse noise increases as the peak SPL exceeds 145 - 155 dB and as {{the duration of the}} impulse, the number of impulses and the number of exposures increase. High-level acoustic impulses can cause severe, permanent hearing loss. Interaction between some <b>steady-state</b> <b>noises</b> and some acoustic impulses can be synergistic, producing extensive injuries to the organ of Corti. Noise can also interact synergistically with some aminoglycoside antibiotics to produce severe injuries in the inner ear. These antibiotics are also capable of producing hearing loss and indeed may do so in up to 55 % of the one million persons who receive aminoglycoside antibiotics during the course of treatment for tuberculosis or severe gram-negative infections. Bacterial and viral infections may also produce mild to severe hearing loss. With the development of rubella vaccine and Rhogam, cytomegalovirus may have become {{the most common cause of}} congenital deafness. Aging is also a major cause of hearing loss. Exposure to occupational and environmental noise, certain diseases and life styles (diet, stress, drugs) may interact with the specific effects of aging.

The test measures the speech reception threshold (SRT) in long-term average speech-spectrum noise via a 1 -up, 1 -down adaptive procedure with a measurement error of 0. 7 dB. One training list is needed for naive listeners. No further learning effects were observed in 24 subsequent SRT measurements. The test was validated by comparing results on the test with results on the standard sentences-in-noise test. To avoid the confounding of hearing loss, age, and linguistic skills, these measurements were performed in normal-hearing subjects with simulated hearing loss. The signals were spectrally smeared and/or low-pass filtered at varying cutoff frequencies. After correction for measurement error the correlation coefficient between SRTs measured with both tests equaled 0. 96.

The framework is presenting a controller strategy using a Lyapunov-based resetting mechanism, changing {{one or more of the}} controller states to a different value when an extreme situation is detected. The controller states are reset to a different value if this leads to a drop in the Lyapunov function value. An appropriately selected Lyapunov function is expected to lead to a controller with increased transient performance. In this way, the Lyapunov function is used both as a part i...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a class of}} nonlinear feedback systems perturbed by white noise for which explicit formulas for steady-state probability densities can be found. We show that this class includes {{what has been called}} monotemperaturic systems in earlier work, and establish relationships with Lyapunov functions for the corresponding deterministic systems. We also treat a number of stochastic optimal control problems in the case of quantized feedback, with the performance criteria formulated in terms of the steady-state probability density. Keywords: nonlinear feedback system, white <b>noise,</b> <b>steady-state</b> probability density, quantizer, stochastic optimal control. I. Introduction The study of linear systems excited by white noise is greatly facilitated by the fact that one can explicitly solve the Fokker-Planck equation which describes the time evolution of the probability density. For nonlinear systems the situation is quite different: not only the transient solutions but even the stead [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Dynamics of {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) deposition and scaffold degradation in cell–polymer constructs {{have been studied}} in a random fluctuating environment created due to the applications of growth factors into the in vitro generation of cartilaginous constructs. Existing models of cell–polymer con-structs {{for the design of}} engineered cartilage have been discussed and then a new deterministic scheme in random environment proposed taking into account the effects of growth factors as the environmental variability in the form of Gaussian white <b>noise.</b> <b>Steady-state</b> probability distribution of each individual component of the ECM in its homeostasis is found explicitly. The computer-simulated results of the model have been discussed and then compared with the data from a variety of scaffold systems and culture conditions.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} methodologies for {{evaluation}} of acoustic disturbance emitted by helicopter main rotors in unsteady maneuvers. The {{attention is focused on}} those techniques applied in minimum-noise, optimal trajectories search tools. Typically, noise optimization processes are based on noise estimations conceived as sequences of steady-state flight acoustic predictions, properly selected from dedicated databases. Introducing a multidisciplinary rotor solution procedure including accurate aerodynamic, aeroelastic and aeroacoustic prediction tools suited for unsteady maneuver analyses, this work presents an assessment of methods used for acoustic disturbance identification based on different characterization parameters for correlating unsteady flight conditions with <b>steady-state</b> flight radiated <b>noise.</b> Only the main rotor component is examined, although tail rotor contribution might be included, as well. The numerical investigation concerns a lightweight helicopter model in unsteady flight, and provides comparisons between noise predicted by the considered methods in terms of sound pressure levels on a hub-centered hemisphere rigidly connected to helicopter...|$|R
