The relationship between relative humidity, temperature and wind speed towards the rainfall pattern is analysed. When there are increases of temperature, the relative humidity is relatively lower and affects the amount rainfall. Although the relative humidity of the surrounding is very high, it is not necessary having rainfall. Besides that, it is found that the yearly rainfall amount from 2009 to 2013 for surrounding area Gambang shows not consistent for 5 consecutive years.

40|$|Mobile mapping {{systems are}} {{becoming}} increasingly popular as they can build 3 D models of the environment rapidly by using a laser scanner that is integrated with a navigation system. 3 D mobile mapping has been widely used for applications such as 3 D city modelling and mapping of the scanned environments. However, accurate mapping relies on not only the scanner’s performance {{but also on the}} quality of the navigation results (accuracy and robustness). This paper discusses the potentials of using 3 D mobile mapping systems for landscape change detection, that is traditionally carried out by terrestrial laser scanners that can be accurately geo-referenced at a static location to produce highly accurate dense point clouds. Yet compared to conventional surveying using terrestrial laser scanners, several advantages of mobile mapping systems can be identified. A large area can be monitored in a relatively short period, which enables high repeat frequency monitoring without having to <b>set-up</b> dedicated <b>stations.</b> However, current mobile mapping applications are limited by the quality of navigation results, especially in different environments. The change detection ability of mobile mapping systems is therefore significantly affected by the quality of the navigation results. This paper presents some data collected for the purpose of monitoring from a mobile platform. The datasets are analysed to address current potentials and difficulties. The change detection results are also presented based on the collected dataset.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To review {{currently}} available {{evidence on the}} epidemiology and management of occupational repetitive strain injuries with particular reference to Hong Kong. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: Medline, PubMed and Cochrane Library searches of local and internationally published English journals from 1990 to 2007 regarding repetitive strain injuries. DATA EXTRACTION: All articles involving occupational repetitive strain injuries in Hong Kong were included in this review. DATA SYNTHESIS: There were 16 articles contributing data {{on the impact of}} repetitive strain injuries both in Hong Kong and around the world. There were seven articles dealing with the problem of computer <b>station</b> <b>set-ups</b> and methods for improving the workstation environments. CONCLUSION: Currently there were significant data on the impact of repetitive strain injuries in Hong Kong. The data took the form of compensation claims, days away from work, and cost of medical consultations. Other articles described proper workplace adjustments to help prevent repetitive strain injuries. However, there were no figures in the current literature showing the impact of these adjustments in reducing the incidence of repetitive strain injuries.

Flight state {{information such as}} position, velocity, and vertical rate are broadcast by {{tens of thousands of}} aircraft around the world constantly using onboard ADS-B transponders. These data are identified by a 24 -bit International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) address, are unencrypted, and can be received and decoded with simple ground <b>station</b> <b>set-ups.</b> This large amount of open data brings a huge potential for ATM research. Most studies that rely on aircraft flight data (historical or real-time) require knowledge on the flight phase of each aircraft at a given time [3 – 7]. However, when dealing with large datasets such as from ADS-B, which can contain many tens of thousands of flights, exceptions to deterministic definitions of flight phases are inevitable, due to large variances in climb rate, altitude, velocity, or a combination of these. In this case, instead of using deterministic logic to process and extract flight data based on flight conventions, robust and versatile identification algorithms are required. In this paper, a twofold method is proposed and tested: 1) a machine learning clustering step that can handle large amounts of scattered ADS-B data to extract continuous flights, and 2) a flight phase identification step that can segment flight data of any type of aircraft and trajectory by different flight phases.

40|$|Abstract. Asphalt {{pavements}} form {{an integral}} part of any transportation system. The structural capacity of the hot mix asphalt concrete layers depends on many factors including its temperature. Moreover, temperature can be a major contributor to several types of distresses. Therefore, temperature is a significant factor that affects the performance and life span of a pavement. The Libyan road network expanded at a phenomenal pace from approximately 1500 km of paved roads in 1970 to morethan 100, 000 km in 2008. Brak region is located on the southern east of Libya at latitude (27 ° 31 'N) in the desert. With the recent SHRP and LTTP research findings, it was necessary to investigate the applicability of the models developed from these research studies to Brak's environmental conditions and more generally to the rest of Libyan desert reigions. This paper presents the research undertaken to develop models to predict high and low asphalt pavement temperatures in the Brak region. A pavement monitoring <b>station</b> was <b>set-up</b> in Brak to monitor air and pavement temperatures in different depth, wind speed and solar radiation. Data were collected for 365 days. Daily minimum and maximum temperatures were recorded. A regression analysis was used to develop the minimum and maximum pavement temperature models, using air temperature, wind speed and solar radiation.

Several problems, such as the different reference systems used by the two techniques, require a geodetic approach to solve them. Leica Geosystems was launched SmartStation, an innovative product that integrates a GPS double frequency receiver and a Total Station series 1200. The real integration is obtained from a new firmware that is able to manage and store both kinds of measurements: angle and distance, RTK and other GPS observations. The GPS observations are functionally to the reference system <b>set-up,</b> while total <b>station</b> measurements provide the north direction of the reference system, and carry out a detailed survey using celerimetric measurements. A new instrument implies a new survey methodology, compared to classical techniques. Several survey scenarios can highlight the main advantages, that is no control points are needed, and there are no long traverses, or resections. To evaluate these new technologies and compare them with traditional ones, a case study survey has been conducted on the Porte Palatine, an archaeological building site in Turin, where a topographic referenced network was signalized and measured.

People who were at least thirty years old and who [...] "permanently resided" [...] in the DPR in the previous ten years were electable for terms of four years, and public organisations could nominate candidates. No Voter lists were used, leading to fears of potential duplicate votes. Internet voting was allowed, apparently so that those who lived outside the territory controlled by the DPR could cast a vote. Internet voting started prior to election day. These internet votes were accepted by email, as long as the voter sent a scanned copy of their passport along with their vote.

40|$|The use of {{hydrogen}} (H 2) as transport fuel {{is often said}} to suffer from the ‘chicken and egg’ problem: vehicles that depend on H 2 cannot go on the roads {{due to the lack}} of an adequate infrastructure, and the almost non-existent fleet of H 2 vehicles on the roads makes it economically unsound to build a H 2 infrastructure. Although both hydrogen vehicles (fuel cell and internal combustion engine) and the related infrastructure have been (and are being) developed and some are commercially available, cost is seen as a major barrier. With today's technologies, H 2 only becomes competitive with petrol and diesel when produced at large quantities, suitable for supplying e. g. thousands of H 2 buses. The question is, how might this point be reached, and are there least cost infrastructural pathways to reach it. This paper tries to address the latter question, using the early development of a H 2 infrastructure for buses in London as a case study. The paper presents some of the analyses and results from a Ph. D. project (in progress) being undertaken at Imperial College London, funded by EPSRC (Grant GR/R 50790 / 01). The results presented here illustrate that cost {{of hydrogen}} production and delivery vary mainly with levels of hydrogen demand and delivery distances, as well as other logistic criteria; least cost production–delivery pathways have been identified for various hydrogen demand scenarios and refuelling <b>station</b> <b>set-ups.</b> Another important conclusion is that the pattern of converting a group of refuelling stations to hydrogen (e. g. a group of refuelling stations for buses in London) has a significant effect on the unit cost of hydrogen...|$|R
40|$|Vehicle crush {{measurements}} {{have typically}} been done using either offset methods or punctual survey {{methods such as}} with a total station or using photogrammetry. While offset grid methods are functional in determining 2 -D displacement along the x and y-axis, vertical movement along the z-axis is much harder to achieve. Using a total station to complete crush measurements around a vehicle can yield accurate measurements along all 3 -axis but will require multiple <b>station</b> <b>set-ups</b> to traverse around a vehicle. Depending on the total station being used a second person may also be required to move a prism to each measurement location around the vehicle. In both the offset and total station methods, all points of interest must be measured {{at the time of}} the vehicle inspection. Using photogrammetry to determine 3 -D deformation of a vehicle can result in the accuracy of a total station with only one operator and allows the versatility of measuring any number of points at any time using the available photographs. A system has been created that utilizes photogrammetric technology but greatly increases productivity by automating the camera orientation and point marking process through the use of coded and non-coded targets. This system, utilizing some of the features available in Eos System’s PhotoModeler software, will decrease the time required to map a damaged or exemplar vehicle, increase the total number of points mapped in that time and automate the process of matching the two vehicles for crush determination. For approximately 1 / 2 to 1 / 3 of the cost of a low-end total station, the collision reconstructionist can have a system that will determine a greater number of 3 -D measurements in less time than required for a total station. The same principles and equipment can also be used to complete many of the scene measurement requirements of a collision reconstructionist...|$|R

The perfect set-up is usually determined {{with the help of}} numerical optimization. In reality there are imperfections specific for each part, which are usually adjusted in the workshop manually. To do numerical optimization for each part is computationally expensive. Here the need for a more efficient Data mining analysis method arises. The present thesis investigates the metamodeling techniques in order to approximate the geometry response to the change of the joining station parameters. The aim is to provide the evaluation of the model by interpolating between the geometry and <b>station</b> <b>set-up</b> variations. The suitable regressions, which are able to deal with non-linear geometry behaviour, are selected {{with the help of the}} literature research. The theory behind the numerical simulation, regressions and sampling is studied to ensure the right choice of the metamodel. An automated simulation environment is programmed to assist with the creation of variation in geometry and joining station, numerical solution and analysis. The chosen regressions - Support Vector Regression and Kernel Ridge Regression - are tested on models of different complexity. The errors are evaluated to provide the quantitative measure of the quality of regressions. Possible improvements of the metamodels are studied, such as Latin Hypercube sampling techniques. The reduced complexity metamodels proved to provide a good approximation, while dealing well with non-linearities. On the other hand, it was shown that models with many design variables require improvement in sampling technique to provide better result within reasonable computational costs. At the same time, Latin Hypercube did not provide visible advancements in the tested cases.

40|$|International audienceSeismic {{ambient noise}} {{analyses}} {{have been shown}} to be able to image structural features of the crust and to monitor underground changes of seismic wave ground velocity. We present results of cross-correlation techniques at Bouillante geothermal field, French Antilles, the largest French high-enthalpy geothermal system exploited for electrical power from 3 collocated productive wells. Two power plants generate electricity and fluid extraction rate varies with time and wells are sometimes closed for equipment maintenance. Under the support of the French Environment and Energy Management Agency (ADEME) and the French Research Agency (ANR), BRGM has been analyzing seismic data from a network comprising 5 broadband seismological <b>stations</b> <b>set-up</b> at Bouillante area since 2004. Amongst the large number of earthquakes recorded, we show that no single earthquake could be related to the fluid exploitation. Instead, they are due to the intense regional seismicity. Despite the small number of stations, surface wave travel times computed from ambient noise cross-correlation for about a year suggest that the velocity structure is consistent with the conceptual model of hot (250 °C) and permeable (fractured) geothermal reservoir of Bouillante. We show at several instances that changes of the fluid extraction rate have spatial and temporal slight perturbations on medium wave velocity. For example, when the production stops for maintenance, velocity increases by several percent and with larger amplitude at stations within 1 km distance from the production wells and lower amplitudes (by more than 50 %) at stations further than 2 km from the production wells. In addition, we note that velocity perturbations have a delay of at most 1 day at further stations. We discuss several mechanisms to explain those observations like pressure and stress variations in the geothermal system. The results suggest that the inferred velocity changes, owing the fine sensibility of the inter-correlation method, do not produce stress changes strong enough to trigger micro-seismicity in the Bouillante area. The perturbation (e. g., due to phase change in the hot fluid, change in porosity and fracture closure) would propagate through the fracture system with a speed depending on its structural features. More observations using additional stations would allow us to increase our knowledge of the velocity structure around the geothermal field and understand physical mechanisms behind those controlled perturbations...|$|R

Both {{civilian and military}} users need reliable, real time propagation information to show at any time the feasibility of communicating to {{any part of the}} world on a particular frequency band. For this thesis, an automated receiving/monitoring station for the Northern California DX Foundation (NCDXF) / International Amateur Radio Union (IARU) International Beacon Project was setup at the Hermanus Magnetic Observatory, HMO (34. 42 oS, 19. 22 oE) to monitor international beacons on 20 m, 17 m, 15 m, 12 m and 10 m bands. The beacons form a world wide multiband network. The task of monitoring the beacons was broken down into two steps. Initially the single band station, at 14. 10 MHz, was installed and later it was upgraded to a multiband station capable of automatically monitoring all the five HF bands. The single band station setup involved the construction and installation of the half-wave dipole antenna, construction and installation of an HF choke balun; and the choice of Faros 1. 3 as the appropriate monitoring software. The multiband monitoring <b>station</b> <b>set-up</b> involved the installation of an MFJ- 1778 G 5 RV multiband antenna, construction and installation of a Communication Interface - V (CI-V) level converter and configuring the Faros 1. 3 software to monitor the beacons on all five HF bands. Then a web page was created on the HMO space weather website ([URL] Here, the real-time signal to noise ratio (SNR) and short path (SP) /long path (LP) plots are uploaded every 3 minutes, showing real time HF propagation conditions on the five HF bands. Historical propagation data are archived for later analysis. A preliminary data analysis was done to confirm the peration of the monitoring station. The archived data were analysed and compared to ICEPAC (Ionospheric Communications Enhanced Profile Analysis and Circuit) predictions. Results show that the real-time signal plots as well as the archive of historical signal plots, convey information on ropagation conditions to users in terms that are easy to interpret and understand. ...|$|R

The solar charge station is constructed on Classrooms Building in Engineering Faculty of Izmir Institute of Technology. Sixteen monocrystalline silicon photovoltaic modules having the dimensions of 1. 293 mx 0. 329 mx 0. 034 m and 55 W power rating are used as the photovoltaic generator of the solar charge station. Modules are mounted as if they create an. Omega Shape. which gives its name to the station (Omega Type Solar Charge Station). Vertical and tilted reflectors are used to enhance the electricity generation. Generated electricity is used to charge a lead acid battery, which is protected by five solar charge regulators in order to prevent discharging and overcharging. 50 W halogen lamps working with direct current are chosen as the loads. The system is analyzed both theoretically and experimentally. Theoretical results have shown that Omega Type Solar Charge Station generates more or less steady electricity, approximately 240 MJ through a year period. The reflectors operate better in winter than in summer, theoretically. According to the stations shape, it uses less space on rooftops. Experiments have shown that efficiency of the charge station during summer is considerably high.

40|$|Non-tidal {{sea level}} {{anomalies}} (SLAs) {{can be produced}} by many different dynamical phenomena over many time scales, and they can induce serious damages in coastal regions especially during extreme events. In this work, {{we focus on the}} SLAs in the South China Sea (SCS) to understand whether and how they can be related to the large-scale, seasonal monsoon system which dominates the SCS circulation and dynamics. We have two major objectives. The first one is to understand whether the NE (winter) and SW (summer) monsoons can be responsible for the persistent SLAs, both positive and negative, observed at the SCS ends along the main monsoon path. The second objective is to understand the SCS response as a free system upon onset/relaxation or sudden changes in the forcing wind. It is well known that sudden changes in the forcing mechanism induce free oscillations, or seiches, in closed, semi-enclosed basins and harbors, and we want to identify the possible seiche modes of the SCS. To our knowledge, these two objectives have not been previously addressed. We address these objectives both through observational analysis and modeling simulations. Multi-year tide-gauge data from stations along the coastal regions of the SCS are analyzed examining their spatial correlations. Strong negative correlations are found between the northeast and southwest stations at the two ends of the SCS under the path of the NE/SW monsoons. They correspond to wind-induced positive/negative sea level set-ups lasting for the entire monsoon season and changing sign from winter to summer. Short periods of negative correlations are also found between the SLAs at eastern and western stations during El Niño years in which the monsoons are weaker and have an enhanced E/W component inducing corresponding sea level <b>set-ups.</b> The tide-gauge <b>station</b> at Tanjong Pagar at the southwest SCS end near Singapore is chosen to study four extreme SLAs events in the observational record during 1999. Modeling simulations are carried out to reproduce them. The observed and modeled extreme SLAs agree quite well, both in the amplitude of the highest peak and in phase. Three main peaks are identified in the observational energy spectrum of the de-tided SLAs at the same station in 1999. Using Merian’s formula to evaluate the periods of seiches in idealized basins Wilson (Adv Hydrosci 8 : 1 – 94, 1972) the first two peaks (24. 4 h and 11. 9 h) are found to correspond to the first two seiche modes {{in the direction of the}} main, longer axis of the SCS. The third peak (8. 5 h) is found to correspond to the seiche in the transversal, shorter axis. Finally, modeling simulations are carried out by suddenly dropping a circular bump of water in the quiescent basin at different locations to excite the seiches. The periods of the modeled peaks agree quite well with the observational ones, the first two periods being actually identicalSingapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (Center for Environmental Sensing and Modeling (CENSAM) ...|$|R
40|$|Mount Etna has {{developed}} {{at the intersection of}} two regional tectonic lineaments, the NNW–SSE trending Hybleo–Maltese escarpment, which separates the thick inland continental crust of the African platform from the Ionian Mesozoic oceanic crust, and the NE–SW Messina–Fiumefreddo fault that marks a rift zone between south Calabria and north-eastern Sicily, extending as far as the Mt. Etna area. All tectonic features affect, with outstanding surface features, {{the eastern side of the}} volcano. The eastern flank of the volcano is affected by a long-term motion toward ESE. In 1997, in order to increase the detail of the ground deformation pattern on the lower eastern flank of Mt. Etna, a new GPS network, the “Ionica” network, was installed on this sector of the volcano. This GPS network consists of 24 stations and covers the lower eastern flank of the volcano from the town of Catania to Taormina and from the coastline up to an altitude of about 1300 m. All the new stations consist in self-centring benchmarks; this kind of benchmark allows all <b>station</b> <b>set-up</b> errors to be avoided. Before the merging of the Ionica network to the frame of the global GPS network of Mt. Etna (in June 2001), three surveys were carried out on this network: in September 1997, August 1998 and January 2001. From the ground deformation pattern, it is possible to distinguish two different sectors, showing different characteristics of deformation. The southern part of the network shows a more uniform distribution of the vertical motion with a mean SE-ward horizontal component while the northern one shows an heterogeneous vertical motion with a ESE-ward horizontal component. Furthermore, a higher velocity is detected between 1997 and 1998, due to the additional stress induced by a shallow intrusion on the NW flank of the volcano. The model resulting from data inversions defines a wide sliding plane beneath the entire eastern flank of the volcano with a low dip angle. The expected velocity vectors fit well the observed ones, even if the measured velocities are still quite higher than expected, at lowermost stations. The vertical inclination of the velocity vectors measured during the 1998 – 2001 period, gradually decreases from West to East suggesting a sort of rotational movement of the south-eastern flank, interrupted by some anomalous vectors on the lower part, that show higher vertical velocities. These anomalies, being located on a wedge defined by the intersection of the main NNW–SSE and NE–SW fault systems and near the Timpe faults, are probably due to the activity of the vertical faults cutting the lower eastern flank of Mt. Etna. Stations lying on the hanging wall and on the footwall of the Timpe fault system are affected by similar horizontal displacements, meaning that these structures are moving eastwards together with the sliding flank; this evidence suggests that the Timpe faults are probably second order structures, with respect to the detachment surface. These results depict a structural framework of the eastern flank of Mt. Etna in which the low angle dislocation can be considered as a first order approximation of an actual listric plane and the current active part of the Timpe fault system is confined above the detachment surface...|$|R
