In contrast to the conventional two-coil-based inductive links, this paper presents a magnetically coupled fully planar four-coil printed spiral resonator-based wireless power-transfer system that compensates the adverse effect of low coupling and improves efficiency by using high quality-factor coils. A conformal architecture is adopted to reduce the transmitter and receiver sizes. Both square architecture and circular architectures are analyzed and optimized to provide maximum efficiency at a certain operating distance.

After a preliminary study on magnetic antennas designed separately at 40 MHz with a matching system, a link budget between a spiral coil ingestible capsule transmitter antenna and a <b>square</b> <b>coil</b> onbody receiver antenna has been established {{in the presence of the}} human body. The efficiency (ratio of received power to transmitted power) of the magnetic induction link through a homogeneous human body (muscle) is equal to 0. 6 % when the TX (transmitter) capsule is in front of the RX (receiver) antenna. If the transmission channel is a three-layered human body (muscle / fat / skin) the performances of the inductive link can be enhanced and the efficiency reaches 0. 8 %. These performances can be improved (up to 1 %) when the dimensions of the receiver antenna increase. Consequently, the power consumption can be reduced and hence the battery life of the wireless capsule increases.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{study the effects of}} {{extremely}} low frequency (ELF) electromagnetic magnetic fields on potassium currents in neural cell lines (Neuroblastoma SK-N-BE), using the whole-cell Patch Clamp technique. Such technique is a sophisticated tool capable to investigate the electrophysiological activity at a single cell, and even at single channel level. The total potassium ion currents through the cell membrane was measured while exposing the cells to a combination of static (DC) and alternate (AC) magnetic fields according to the prediction of the so-called â Ion Resonance Hypothesis â.

50|$|Another {{significant}} {{limitation of}} the coilgun is the occurrence of magnetic saturation in the ferromagnetic projectile. When the flux in the projectile lies in the linear portion of its material's B(H) curve, the force applied to the core {{is proportional to the}} <b>square</b> of <b>coil</b> current (I)—the field (H) is linearly dependent on I, B is linearly dependent on H and force is linearly dependent on the product BI. This relationship continues until the core is saturated; once this happens B will only increase marginally with H (and thus with I), so force gain is linear. Since losses are proportional to I2, increasing current beyond this point eventually decreases efficiency although it may increase the force. This puts an absolute limit on how much a given projectile can be accelerated with a single stage at acceptable efficiency.|$|R

The effects of wire coil insert with different parameter on heat transfer and friction loss in the helical tube were examined with Dean number (De) ranging from 700 to 2000. The circular or <b>square</b> <b>coil</b> wire has different cross sections, inserted in the tube with different pitch. The wire coil with Al 2 O 3 nanoparticles with a diameter of 80 nm dispersed in distilled water with volume concentrations of (0. 08, 0. 1, 0. 2 and 0. 3 vol. %) were used as the test fluid. The effects of Dean Number, volume concentration of suspended nanoparticles, and wire coil on heat characteristics were investigated. The results reveal {{that the use of}} tabulators leads to a considerable increase in heat transfer and friction loss over those of a smooth tube. The Nusselt number increases with increasing of Dean number and reduction in pitch of wire <b>coil.</b> The <b>square</b> type of wire coil provides slightly higher heat transfer than the circular under the same conditions. Results show that the optimum heat transfer is caused of P= 15 mm of wire coils. Adding nanoparticles to the base fluid causes a significant enhancement in heat transfer characteristics. The overall enhancement in heat transfer using two mechanisms simultaneously compared to using pure fluid within the smooth helical tube exceeds over 213. 2 % (180 % spring enhancement + 33. 2 %Al 2 O 3).

The reason did not lie solely in the much improved Q factor of the unloaded coils. Despite a more than twofold increase in the unloaded Q factor, the loaded coil Q values only increased by 8 %. It would appear, however, that the resistive, dielectric and inductive noise components are all reduced, and hence contribute to the observed improved S/N. The reduction in pure ohmic losses accounts for a quarter of the improved S/N, while the reduced inductive and dielectric losses provide the remaining three quarters.

Sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal eddy current heating losses in non-magnetic conducting discs and spheres, subjected to a uniform field, are studied both theoretically and experimentally. The theory uses two different methods to calculate the power dissipation in the objects, and it employs Fourler series for the non-sinusoidal case.

40|$|The {{past few}} decades have seen {{a revival of the}} {{interest}} in wireless power transfer (WPT) long after the first experiments dating as far back as Nikolai Tesla in the 19 th century. The rise of the autonomous electronic devices like medical implants, or portable devices like mobile phones, have motivated the search for wireless power charging systems. The growing interest in electric vehicles has helped this surge in research, with WPT promising to be a faster, more practical, vandalism-free charging method. One main problem with WPT systems is their low tolerance to misalignment between the transmitter and the receiver, affecting their efficiency. Another issue is the danger of being obstructed by foreign (metallic) or live objects, heating them to unsafe levels. This thesis investigates a possible solution for both problems in WPT by suggesting a modular primary design, rather than a singular transmitter. The different transmitter coils can be turned on and off if sufficiently aligned with the receiver, and not obstructed by parasitic objects. The thesis starts by introducing WPT and offering theoretical background information. The optimal coil geometry is investigated for this thesis, and found to be in agreement with literature as a <b>square</b> <b>coil.</b> An example is then studied for the design of a 1 m 2 square area segmented into 16 identical coils, with a proposed circuitry for connecting the coils, as well as controlling them. The studied coils are single, one-turn, air-cored coils. The possible values of the equivalent total inductance of the primary are computed for all the combinations of activated coils producing 5020 unique values. A capacitor bank design is then proposed to match all the possibilities. With the help of some operating frequency lenience around resonance of 1. 8 % of the resonance frequency, the designed capacitor matrix is able to answer all 5020 inductance possibilities with as few as 19 capacitors. A flowchart mapping the design process is offered. The misalignment tolerance of the new design is analyzed, and is found to be superior to that of a conventional coil. The enhanced response to foreign and live objects is intrinsic to the modular design, and so is the safer magnetic influence on the surroundings, due to the smaller, more-concentrated operating coils. The Finite Element Methods (FEM) verification of the results showed discrepancies in the behaviors due to the failure of the developed analytical models to grasp the underlying physics of the repulsed magnetic fluxes. This behavior is important in studying the behavior of adjacent inductors, and further FEM and/or experimental verification of the results is encouraged. Further suggestions are made for future works to optimize the design. Sustainable Energy Technolog...|$|R

The results indicate that addition of small amounts of nanoparticles up to 1 % improves significantly the heat transfer performance; however, further addition tends to deteriorate heat transfer performance.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the effect of}} inductive coil shape on the sensing performance of a linear displacement sensor. The linear displacement sensor consists of a thin type inductive coil with a thin pattern guide, thus being suitable for tiny space applications. The position can be detected by measuring the inductance of the inductive coil. At each position due to the change in inductive coil area facing the pattern guide the value of inductance is different. Therefore, {{the objective of this}} research is to study various inductive coil pattern shapes and to propose the pattern that can achieve good sensing performance. Various shapes of meander, triangular type meander, square and circle shape with different turn number of inductive coils are examined in this study. The inductance is measured with the sensor sensitivity and linearity as a performance evaluation parameter of the sensor. In conclusion, each inductive coil shape has its own advantages and disadvantages. For instance, the circle shape inductive coil produces high sensitivity with a low linearity response. Meanwhile, the <b>square</b> shape inductive <b>coil</b> has a medium sensitivity with higher linearity...|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} {{mechanisms that}} allow plant roots to use gravity and touch as growth guides are investigated. We {{are using a}} molecular genetic strategy in Arabidopsis thaliana to study these processes. When Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings grow on tilted hard-agar surfaces, their roots develop a wavy pattern of growth which appears to derive from a succession of left-handed and right-handed circumnutation-like processes triggered by gravity and touch stimulation (Okada and Shimura, 1990; Rutherford et al., 1998; Rutherford and Masson, 1996). Interestingly, mutations that affect root waving on tilted hard-agar surfaces can be identified and characterized. Some of these mutations affect root gravitropism, while others appear {{to be responsible for}} the production of abnormal waves (no waves, compressed or <b>square</b> waves, <b>coils)</b> without affecting gravitropism. The specific objectives of this project were to functionally characterize two genes (WVD 2 and WVD 6) which are required for root waving on tilted agar surfaces, but not for root gravitropism. Specific objectives included a physiological and cytological analysis of the mutants, and molecular cloning and characterization of the corresponding genes. As summarized in this paper, we have reached these objectives. We have also identified and partially characterized other mutations that affect root skewing on hard-agar surfaces (sku 5 - 1 and ago 1), and have completed our work on the root-wave phenotype associated with mutations in genes of the tryptophan biosynthesis pathway (Lynn et al., 1999; Rutherford et al., 1998; Sedbrook et al., 2000, 2002). We briefly describe our progress on the cloning and characterization of WVD 6, WVD 2 and SKU 5, and provide a list of papers (published, or in preparation) that derived from this grant. We also discuss the biological implications of our findings, with special emphasis on the analysis of WVD 2...|$|R
40|$|Inductive {{proximity}} sensors {{are widely}} used for the contactless measurement of object or target displacement and position in numerous technical products and systems. They are found in various application domains such as transportation, robots, assembly lines, telecommunication or security. The inductive sensing principle {{is known for its}} robustness, high precision and low sensitivity to environmental conditions as well as to extreme working conditions like cryogenic temperatures. The typical measuring range of inductive proximity sensors is between 0. 1 cm and 5 cm. The overall dimensions of the smallest inductive proximity sensors, including the sensing coil and the electronic circuit interface, is rarely under some cubic centimeters, due to the high number of components of which such sensors are composed. Although the electronic interface circuitry may be integrated in an "application specific integrated circuit" (ASIC), the traditional fabrication processes of the inductive primary transducer (the coil and the flux concentrator) set the limit to the scaling down. The introduction of the inductive principle for proximity sensors into new technical mechatronic systems requires a small size and ease of fabrication (i. e. a low cost). The challenge of this thesis work was to develop such a sensor by using new technologies for the integration of microsystems. In this work, we successfully demonstrate the integration of an inductive proximity sensor on a small-size chip, and its usefulness as a key component in new sensing and mechatronic applications. To the best of our knowledge, we have realized the first fully integrated inductive proximity sensor ever reported. This challenge has been taken up by first studying the effect of the miniaturization on the basic behavior of sensing coils, and then by determining the scaling down laws as well as the limitations due to the parasitics, especially the increase of the inductor series resistance. Considering these first results, we developed a new and simple electronic interface, namely the differential relaxation oscillator. This highly sensitive, self oscillating circuit has only few components and the output signal is digital compatible. This readout principle is well adapted for miniaturized coils with low Q factor. A comparator has been designed and integrated with the two relaxation branches, forming the oscillator, on an ASIC. The miniaturized flat coil has been integrated on top of this ASIC using photolithography and electrodeposition compatible with the standard processes. The connections between the coil and the electronic circuit interface is realized through vias. In its smaller version, the integrated sensor chip size is of 1. 5 x 2 mm 2 with a <b>square</b> <b>coil</b> of 1 x 1 mm 2 on top. This miniaturized flat coil has an inductance of 75 nH, a serial resistance of 6. 2 Ω and a resonance frequency of 315 MHz. Its excitation frequency is close to 10 MHz. No external component is needed for this microsensor basic functioning, and the connections with the external world are limited to power supply and output signal. This integrated sensor is fabricated using the 1 µm 3 V CMOS technology and the standard and compatible gold bumping layer to form the coil. This new device has been successfully tested. In the measuring range from 50 µm up to 150 µm, it shows a high sensitivity (24 kHz/µm) and a submicrometric resolution. The temperature behavior of integrated coils, of the electronic circuit principle and of their combination as a integrated sensor, has been studied. A simple temperature compensation scheme using one NTC resistor, compatible with the sensor integration, has been developed and tested successfully. Using this method, a temperature independence better than ± 100 ppm/°C between - 20 °C and + 80 °C has been achieved with the 3. 8 mm side flat coil version of the integrated inductive proximity sensor. New application have been demonstrated, using the good performances of the developed inductive proximity sensor microsystems. Metallic profile and inductive coin imaging have been successfully recorded. The angular position control of a watch motor has been evidenced with an angular precision of 2 DEG (limited by the step motor). The angular speed and position sensing of a non-ferromagnetic toothed wheel has been sensed up to at least 7800 rpm (corresponding to an excitation of 13 kHz). The application and the promising perspective of our integrated inductive proximity sensor into active magnetic bearings for hard disk drives has been presented. This multidisciplinary thesis work has been realized with emphasis on using simple elements and on obtaining a simple overall behavior. The device has only one coil, it uses only one comparator, it is made of only one chip, and moreover it can be fabricated in only one wafer foundry using standard processes. By focusing on the optimization of the global sensor system, good performances have been achieved and the integration of an inductive proximity sensor has been proven...|$|R
