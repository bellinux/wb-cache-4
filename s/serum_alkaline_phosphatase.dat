In breast carcinomas only 19 % {{of the patients}} expressed significant placental <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> activity, compared with 78 % in gastrointesti-nal tumours. The intestinal isoenzyme was found in 50 % of the breast carcinomas and in {{nearly all of the}} other examined tissues. The two isoenzymes usually represent 1 % of the total <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> activity, but in a few cases they may constitute between 10 and 90 %. In the serum of the patients under examination, elevated total <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> activity was found in only 7 %, and elevated placental alkaline phospha-tase in 6 % of the cases. No cases of elevated <b>serum</b> intestinal <b>alkaline</b> <b>phosphatase</b> were found.

40|$|THE {{relation}} of bilharziasis and bladder cancer in Egypt {{is of interest}} and some preliminary results on the urinary excretion of certain tryptophan metabolites were reported in these conditions (Abul-Fadl and Khalafallah, 1961). The present work considers the enzymological aspect of the problem, since the role of certain enzymes particularly the / 8 -glucuronidase in the mechanism of the bladder cancer production has been frequently discussed (Boyland, Wallace and Williams, 1957; Boyland, Gasson and Williams, 1957). An increase in the urinary 8 -glucuronidase excretion in schistosomiasis was reported by Fripp (1960) in West Africa.

Ursodeoxycholic acid therapy is beneficial, but the disease often progresses and may require liver transplantation. Animal studies suggested that treatment with FXR agonists should be beneficial in cholestatic diseases such as PBC.

Methods: In a quasi-experimental trial study twenty one male patients with type 2 diabetes(40 - 50 years) were randomly divided into exercise(n= 11) and control(n= 10) groups. The exercise group underwent a 10 -week aerobic exercise program(three sessions per week, 45 - 60 minutes each session, at 50 - 65 % of heart rate reserve).
