25|$|French General Pierre Jadart Dumerbion {{commanded}} the Army of Italy. Competent but old, he had <b>seen</b> <b>too</b> many generals {{sent to the}} guillotine for failing or for having the wrong political views. Two of his predecessors suffered this fate, Brunet on 15 November 1793 and Biron on 31 December 1793. In order {{to stay out of}} trouble, Dumerbion determined to consult the all-powerful Representatives on mission before acting. At this time, the representatives were Augustin Robespierre and Antoine Christophe Saliceti and both were influenced by freshly-promoted General of Brigade Napoleon Bonaparte, the army's new artillery chief. Bonaparte drew up a strategic plan and Dumerbion listened. Bonaparte planned to launch a drive northeast along the coast to capture Oneglia, a nest of Sardinian privateers that preyed on the Genoa-to-Nice grain trade. From Oneglia, the French would turn north to seize Ormea, outflanking the enemy's defenses from the east. While these moves were implemented, the main army would distract the Coalition defenders by advancing directly on Saorge. Of Dumerbion's 43,000-man field army, 20,000 men formed the attacking force, divided into three columns and a reserve.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the motivations}} of those Australians that volunteered {{to serve in}} Russia can really only be guessed at, they seem {{unlikely}} to have been political. Maybe, as one historian has suggested, [...] "a few had not seen enough fighting, or perhaps had <b>seen</b> <b>too</b> much." [...] Regardless they confirmed the Australians' reputation for audacity and courage, winning the only two Victoria Crosses of the land campaign. However, as the Australian government had refused flatly to supply forces for the intervention, their involvement was limited. Indeed, Australian involvement in North Russia was a minor episode in its history, and was barely noticed in Australia at the time. Ultimately {{it made no difference}} to the outcome of the Russian Civil War either, perhaps other than to help confirm the Bolshevik's mistrust of the Western powers. Total Australian casualties included 10 killed and 40 wounded, with most deaths being from disease during the Mesopotamian operations.|$|E
500|$|In April 1973, the Manchester Union Leader accused Chotiner {{of having}} {{organized}} the Watergate break-in. He responded by bringing suit for libel against the Union Leader and its lead investigator. In December 1973, the parties reached a settlement by which Chotiner received an undisclosed, but substantial, {{sum of money}} and the newspaper printed a front-page apology and retraction of its accusations in its December 31, 1973 edition. Chotiner described Watergate in January 1973 as [...] "a stupid, useless, inane experiment {{by people who have}} <b>seen</b> <b>too</b> many TV shows and especially too many productions of [...] ". According to The Washington Post, Chotiner was not close to Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, and most other staffers at the White House and CRP. In a taped discussion of the fallout from Watergate, Haldeman told Nixon that his former campaign manager was not [...] "wired in", and the President expressed strong opposition to Chotiner being used as a White House contact. At the suggestion that Chotiner could defend him, Nixon worried that the attorney might not be willing to do so.|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rotten Tomatoes, Gosling was asked what had attracted him to the film, and whether he had read the script at the time Jackman and director Neil Marshall were attached to it. He replied: I think {{that might be the}} original one I read. I read a few drafts. I read one as well where he wasn't a stunt driver at all, which was a newer draft [...] maybe that's the one Hugh Jackman had; I'm not sure exactly. Basically when I read it, in {{trying to figure out who}} would do something like this, the only way to make sense of this is that this is a guy that's <b>seen</b> <b>too</b> many movies, and he's started to confuse his life for a film.

[...] "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig" [...] includes several pop cultural references to films and television shows. The last line in the episode, [...] "That'll do pig", spoken by Cartman, is a reference to the final line of the 1995 film Babe, a movie about a talking pig, which Stone has described as one of his favorite films.

500|$|The tunnel {{construction}} became unintentionally {{involved in}} the women's rights movement when Janet Bonnema applied for a position as an engineering technician with the Colorado Department of Transportation. She was given an assignment on the Straight Creek Tunnels project, but her supervisor misread her resume and thought he was hiring [...] "James". When the supervisor discovered the department had hired a woman, she was instead tasked with doing support work from the office. There was opposition to a woman entering the construction site: One supervisor stated that if she entered, [...] "Those workers would flat walk out of that there tunnel and they'd never come back". The workers, most of whom had a mining background, expressed a common superstition that a woman brought bad luck to a mine. One worker insisted, [...] "It's a jinx. I've <b>seen</b> <b>too</b> many die after a woman was in the tunnel." [...] Bonnema sued the department {{for the right to}} work inside the tunnel. She countered she was in better shape and more agile than most of the men working on the tunnel. Emboldened by the passage of an equal rights law in Colorado, she finally entered the tunnel, with an entourage of reporters, on November 9, 1972. Some workers did walk off the job; at least one yelled, [...] "Get those women out of here". She remained determined and re-entered the tunnel a few days later. The next time she dressed in coveralls, and was even assigned tasks {{on the roof of the}} tunnel overlooking the men below. Surprised that nobody apparently noticed she was a woman, she stated, [...] "I had a good disguise".|$|E

2500|$|When Philip IV of Spain died in 1665, {{the great}} powers {{wondered}} how long his heir, the sickly Charles II, would last. [...] Wilhelm was put to work by France to begin negotiations related to the succession in Spain and in the Spanish Netherlands. [...] In the run up to the War of Devolution, Wilhelm carried funds to Maximilian to fund the build-up of an army for Cologne. [...] He also visited the Count Palatine of Neuburg, Philip Wilhelm, and the Elector of Bavaria to persuade them not to allow Austrian forces to move through their lands to oppose French maneuvers in the Netherlands. [...] On 8 January 1667, Wilhelm went to Vienna representing Cologne (but {{acting on behalf of}} France), to sound out the Emperor's feelings about the succession, perhaps splitting the Netherlands from Spain after the death of Charles. [...] There he spent much time establishing relationships with various ministers at the court. [...] He was offered titles and money to join the Habsburg side and work {{for the end of the}} League of the Rhine, but he demurred. [...] He was also sought by Petar Zrinski, who wished his help (and thus French help) in a Hungarian revolution. [...] Wilhelm avoided being <b>seen</b> <b>too</b> often with him. [...] However, he did let Louis XIV know of the Hungarian revolutionaries, and their potential to provide an opportune diversion for Austrian forces. [...] This laid the ground for a 1668 treaty between France and Austria agreeing that if Charles died without an heir, France would receive the Spanish Netherlands, the County of Burgundy, Navarre, the Philippines, the Two Sicilies, and Morocco, while the remaining Spanish territories would go to Austria.|$|E
