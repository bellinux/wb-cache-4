Hopgood flew toward the convoy until he found the speeding destroyer, advised her how to steer, and then flew back to hunt for the U-boat again.

King William II then re-granted most of the de Mowbray lands to Juhel de Totnes (died 1123/30), the first feudal baron of Barnstaple. The manor thus became a constituent part of the Feudal barony of Barnstaple and the barons remained the feudal overlords for many centuries.

(c) The third point made in the article is that dangers of an approaching slump are being disguised at the moment by the amount of stock building which is going on around the world. (d) It appears that most of the finance ministries of the world are relatively optimistic.

40|$|This thesis deals {{about the}} dynamic of the migratory trend of Nepalese labors from Nepal to Malaysia. Though the {{remittances}} contribute significantly to Nepal’s national domestic product (GDP), the higher rate of labor migration is problematic concern including labor shortage in Nepalese labor market. The labor shortage mainly in agriculture and construction is high concern. On average more than 1500 Nepalese labors leave the country daily for employment. The recent official record shows that about 2. 5 million Nepalese labors work abroad. Officially, the Malaysian labor market was open for Nepalese labors in 2001 however, now Malaysia constitutes about 40 percent of total international labor migration from Nepal. The earning gap effect and effect of labor migration cost are accounted to drive the fractional migration rate and finally to the labor migration rate. The low earning rate and wage rate in Nepal than in Malaysia are push factors for Nepalese labors to migrate. On other hand, low job creation rate in Nepal is crucial factor of the labor emigration. Additionally, the social network effect on the labor migration cost also plays role to take {{the decision of the}} labor migration. The labor migration increases if both effects are increased however, the increment in the potential Nepalese labors also changes the migration rate. Once the GDP in the country is increased the earning gap decreases that lowers the migration rate. The government policy initiative to increase the GDP through employment generation is proposed to avoid the higher rate of the migration. The policy implementation comprises particularly the training component relating to the entrepreneurship, improved cropping method to increase agricultural yields. The implementation challenges including borrowed money payback is the major concern of the policy though the model does not deal about it extensively. This thesis is organized mainly in five sections with relevant <b>sub</b> <b>heading.</b> The introduction deals about the problematic nature of the labor migration from Nepal while the theoretical backing of the thesis and relevant studies relating to the migration is in the literature review section.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new design of an {{efficient}} cluster head in wireless sensor head {{which is based}} on nested cluster <b>head</b> (<b>sub</b> cluster <b>head).</b> In Wireless Networks;cluster head is the key technology where nodes transmit the information to the base station. The energy consumption in a wireless network can be reduced by allowing only some nodes to communicate with the base station. One way to support efficient communication between sensors is to organize the network into several groups, called clusters, with each cluster electing one node as the head of cluster. To support scalability, nodes are often grouped into disjoint and mostly non-overlapping clusters. In nested cluster head approach instead of sensor nodes sends the data to cluster heads directly, each node sends data to <b>sub</b> cluster <b>head</b> and master node (master cluster head) sends the data to the base station. A cluster head can send and receive the message to their respective sub-cluster head and vice versa. This approach is used to save power consumption of cluster head.
