5|$|Most {{variants}} of the CFM56 feature a single-annular combustor. An annular combustor is a continuous ring where fuel is {{injected into the}} airflow and ignited, raising the pressure and temperature of the flow. Other types of combustors include can combustors, where each combustion chamber is separate, and canannular which is a hybrid of the two. Fuel injection is regulated by a Hydromechanical Unit (HMU), built by Honeywell. The HMU regulates the amount of fuel delivered to the engine {{by means of an}} electrohydraulic <b>servo</b> <b>valve</b> that, in turn, drives a fuel metering valve, that provides information to the full authority digital engine controller (FADEC).|$|E
25|$|The pilot's {{movement}} of a control causes the mechanical circuit {{to open the}} matching <b>servo</b> <b>valve</b> in the hydraulic circuit. The hydraulic circuit powers the actuators which then move the control surfaces. As the actuator moves, the <b>servo</b> <b>valve</b> is closed by a mechanical feedback linkage - one that stops {{movement of}} the control surface at the desired position.|$|E
25|$|The {{pressure}} of fuel from the fuel pump pushes against the diaphragm in chamber C, moving the <b>servo</b> <b>valve</b> toward the closed position. The fuel also flows to the mixture control valve, which is closed {{when in the}} idle-cutoff position and open in all other positions.|$|E
50|$|In 1960, further {{agreements}} with Bendix brought licensed production of hydraulic <b>servo</b> <b>valves</b> to Normalair's range of products. This expertise was then developed into for electro-hydraulic <b>servo</b> <b>valves,</b> actuators and lightweight solenoid operated hydraulic valves. The company also produced marine hydraulics and valves for submarines.|$|R
5000|$|The {{hydraulic}} circuits {{are similar}} except that mechanical <b>servo</b> <b>valves</b> are replaced with electrically controlled <b>servo</b> <b>valves,</b> {{operated by the}} electronic controller. This is the simplest and earliest configuration of an analog fly-by-wire flight control system. In this configuration, the flight control systems must simulate [...] "feel". The electronic controller controls electrical feel devices that provide the appropriate [...] "feel" [...] forces on the manual controls. This was used in Concorde, the first production fly-by-wire airliner.|$|R

25|$|There {{are four}} {{chambers}} in the fuel regulator {{portion of the}} carburetor. They are referred to by letters A, B, C, and D, with the A chamber closest to the throttle body. The fuel metering <b>servo</b> <b>valve</b> responds to pressure differentials across the diaphragms separating the chambers. The resulting diaphragm movement controls fuel flow into the engine under all flight conditions.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, air {{entering}} the carburetor compresses {{the air in}} the impact tubes, generating a positive pressure in chamber B that is proportional to the density and speed of the air entering the engine. The difference in pressure between chamber A and chamber B creates the air metering force which opens the <b>servo</b> <b>valve</b> allowing the fuel into the fuel regulator.|$|E
25|$|During the {{investigation}} of Flight 427, the NTSB discovered that the PCU's dual <b>servo</b> <b>valve</b> could jam, as well, and deflect the rudder {{in the opposite direction}} of the pilots' input, due to thermal shock, caused when cold PCUs are injected with hot hydraulic fluid. As a result of this finding, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered the servo valves to be replaced and new training protocol for pilots to handle unexpected movement of flight controls to be developed. The FAA ordered an upgrade of all Boeing 737 rudder control systems by 12 November 2002.|$|E
40|$|Precise {{positioning}} system {{is required in}} the fields of semi-conductor manufacturing process. A pneumatic servo table system is one of a precise {{positioning system}}. The features of the table are little friction force and little heat generation. Generally, the controller of this system is designed by neglecting the characteristics of <b>servo</b> <b>valves.</b> However, in high frequency band, the response of this system becomes unstable because of the characteristics of the valves. In this paper, we demonstrate that by considering the characteristics of <b>servo</b> <b>valves,</b> the position control of a pneumatic servo table could be improved. First, the dynamic characteristics of <b>servo</b> <b>valves</b> were examined. It became clear that the characteristics could be described as a second-order system. Then, the servo table system was designed as a fifth-order system. It became clear that the position accuracy of this system were greatly improved...|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the NTSB's findings, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered that the <b>servo</b> <b>valves</b> be {{replaced}} on all 737s by November 12, 2002. The FAA also ordered new training protocols for pilots to handle in an unexpected movement of flight controls.|$|R
25|$|The {{hydraulic}} circuit, {{which has}} hydraulic pumps, reservoirs, filters, pipes, valves and actuators.

25|$|Another {{potential}} {{factor that}} led to the crash of the 737 aircraft was the power control unit (PCU) that controlled the aircraft's rudder. The cause of some 737 crashes such as USAir Flight 427 had been attributed to the 737's rudder issues. Although the NTSB and PCU manufacturer Parker Hannifin had already determined that the PCU was properly working, and thus not the cause of the crash, a private investigation into the crash for a civil lawsuit tried by jury in a California state court in Los Angeles, which was not allowed to hear or consider the NTSB's and Parker Hannifin's conclusions, decided that the crash was caused by a defective <b>servo</b> <b>valve</b> inside the PCU, based on forensic findings from an electron microscope which determined that minute defects within the PCU had caused the rudder hard-over and a subsequent uncontrollable flight and crash. The manufacturer of the aircraft's rudder controls and the families later reached an out-of-court settlement.|$|E
25|$|Investigators later {{discovered}} that the recovered accident rudder PCU was much more sensitive to bench-tests than other new PCU's. The exact mechanism of the failure involved the <b>servo</b> <b>valve,</b> which remains dormant and cold {{for much of the}} flight at high altitude, seizing after being injected with hot hydraulic fluid that has been in continuous action throughout the plane. This specific condition occurred in fewer than 1% of the lab tests, but explained the rudder malfunction that caused Flight 427 to crash. The jam left no trace of evidence after it occurred and a Boeing engineer later found that a jam under this controlled condition could also lead to the slide moving in the opposite direction than that commanded. In light of this, Boeing felt that the test results were not real-world and not applicable due to the extremes under which the valve was tested. Boeing stated that the rudder reversal was more likely psychological, likening it to examples when a human panics and intends to step on the brake during an automotive accident, but accidentally presses on the gas pedal instead while under duress. The FAA's official position was that there was not enough evidence for probable cause of rudder system failure.|$|E
2500|$|The air {{metering}} {{force from}} chambers A and B [...] is {{opposed by the}} fuel metering force from chambers C and D. [...] These two forces combine into movement of the <b>servo</b> <b>valve</b> to adjust the fuel flow to the precise amount required {{for the needs of}} the engine, and the needs of the pilot.|$|E

50|$|Chinese {{consider}} the greatest achievement of Q-6 in its fly-by-wire (FBW) {{control of the}} variable-sweep wing, both were {{the first of its}} kind in China. The original goal of reverse engineering the FBW of F-111 proved to be far too ambitious and had to be abandoned, and much simpler version was adopted. The triplex analog FBW of Q-6 is just slightly more advanced the most rudimentary FBW in that it used the same principle of the most rudimentary FBW in replacing the mechanical <b>servo</b> <b>valves</b> with electrical <b>servo</b> <b>valves</b> operated by electronic controller, but contrary to the most rudimentary FBW where hydraulic actuators still existed, the hydraulic actuators are replaced by electrical actuators on Q-6. The system proved to be major obstacle in the development and it took nine years to complete (1980-1988), under the personal leadership of Mr. Lu Xiaopeng. Although hailed as a technological breakthrough for the Chinese aviation by China, and provided superior performance, the Chinese system was more than 12% heavier than the simple mechanical-hydraulic controlled variable-sweep wing of MiG-23, reducing the weapon payload, fuel capacity and combat radius, which contributed partially to the final cancellation of Q-6.|$|R
40|$|English When {{developing}} modern {{control systems}} like anti-lock braking systems (ABS), traction control (TC), brake assistant (BAS) and electronic stability programs (ESP) to increase safety and comfort in vehi-cles, accurate tyre models are very important. Numerical simulation models {{are needed to}} predict the vehicle’s behaviour for various driving conditions. Testing facilities like the tyre measurement tower are needed to provide the necessary experimental data to validate these tyre models. The tyre measurement tower of the Dynamics and Control section of the TU Eindhoven, is already capable of simulating different situations, but it needs hydraulic actuators to subject the wheel to vertical vibra-tions and alternating steer angles. This report discusses {{the design of a}} vertical hydraulic actuator for the tyre measurement tower. A theoretical model of the hydraulic actuator and the measurement tower is developed, to determine what size of hydraulic cylinder is needed to fulfill the demands for good tyre measurement. This is done for a-symmetrical and symmetrical cylinder types. The size of these hydraulic cylinders limit the choice between <b>servo</b> <b>valves,</b> and this choice has a substantial effect on the dynamics of the total system. Some available hydraulic cylinders and <b>servo</b> <b>valves</b> ar...|$|R
2500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the NTSB and Parker Hannifin had already ruled out the {{possibility}} of mechanical failure as a cause to the crash of Flight 185 due to a defective PCU servo valve-unit (manufactured by Parker Hannifin), an independent and private investigation refocused on and further examined the recovered PCU device whose malfunctioning has been pointed out in other sudden Boeing 737 crashes. The manufacturer's records relating to this particular unit revealed that it had failed some routine tests, but they claimed to have corrected these problems. A metals expert, with the use of images from a scanning electron microscope, concluded that the <b>servo</b> <b>valve</b> had 'chip-outs' and numerous burrs [...] "that could easily have interfered with the smooth operation of the valve." [...] After this investigation was complete, in 2004, a Los Angeles Superior Court jury in the United States, which was not allowed to hear or consider the NTSB's conclusions about the accident, found that the crash was caused by a defective <b>servo</b> <b>valve</b> in the plane's rudder. The hydraulic PCU device manufacturer, Parker Hannifin, was ordered to pay the three families of victims involved in that case US$43.6 million. After threatening to appeal the verdict, Parker Hannifin later compensated all families involved (although it did not accept liability).|$|E

The outer end of the rod connects to the fuel metering <b>servo</b> <b>valve</b> that moves away from the throttle body to open, allowing more fuel flow or toward the throttle body to close, reducing the amount of fuel to flow.
