40|$|Introduction: By {{increase}} of esthetic demand, application of resin composite as a posterior restoration {{is greater than}} before. Microleakage and post operative sensitivity are two challenges {{to the success of}} this filling material. To overcome these, the best selection of dentin bonding system and light curing units are important. This study evaluated the two above mentioned factors. Methods and Materials: In this experimental study class II cavities were prepared in both mesial and distal side of 30 healthy third molar teeth, and the samples randomly divided into 4 groups. Each group restored by use of one of these bonding system: total etch (Excite) or <b>self</b> <b>etch</b> (SE Bond) and one of light curing units: QTH or LED, and a similar restorative composite. After thermocycling, sealing and immersing the samples in dye, they sectioned and evaluated by steriomicroscope and analyzed by Mann-Whitney test. Results: LED light curing unit and <b>self</b> <b>etch</b> bonding agent had best result in controlling microleakage. Conclusion: LED depth of cure is more than that of QTH and the efficacy of <b>self</b> <b>etch</b> primer to infiltration etched dentin is greeter than total etch dentin bonding agents, because they do not dehydrate dentin and do not collapse collagen fibers.

40|$|Introduction Quality and {{durability}} of enamel/composite interface essentially depend on an adhesive restorative system. Objective The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the quality of marginal adaptation of composite adhesive systems to enamel by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and to analyze the morphology of the enamel surface along margins of composite restorations, following exposure to cariogenic solution. Methods The study material included 56 extracted human third molars. Class V cavities were prepared with margins at enamel. Cavities were restored with Single Bond/Z 250 and Single Bond/Filtek flow, using the total etch adhesive system, and Prompt-L-Pop/Z 250 and Prompt-L-Pop/Filtek flow, using the <b>self</b> <b>etch</b> adhesive system. After the restorative procedure, the restorations were submitted to demineralization during 7 and 28 days. Samples were stored in a cariogenic solution (lactic acid, pH 4. 5; 0. 1 M) at 37 °C or in deionized water (the control group). The margins of restorations and perimarginal enamel were examined by scanning electron microscope (SEM). The gap formations around restoration were measured on cervical, occlusal and approximate margins. Results The usage of the total etch adhesive system showed statistically significant lower marginal gap width around composite restoration, compared with the <b>self</b> <b>etch</b> system (p< 0. 01). The SEM examination also showed perimarginal enamel zones presenting several signs of demineralization and erosion (alteration of rods, porosities) after acting of a cariogenic solution, in both adhesive methods. Less alteration was found on the enamel surfaces not included in the perimarginal zone. Conclusion Treating the cavity with 35 % phosphoric acid in the total etch system significantly improved the adaptation of the composite resins to enamel, compared with the <b>self</b> <b>etch</b> treatment.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} caries infiltrant preconditioning on the shear bond strength of orthodontic resin cements on sound and demineralized enamel. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Stainless-steel brackets were bonded to sound or artificially demineralized (14 d, acidic buffer, pH 5. 0) bovine enamel specimens using a resin cement {{or a combination of}} caries infiltrant preconditioning (Icon, DMG) and the respective resin cement (light-curing composite: Heliosit Orthodontic, Transbond XT, using either Transbond XT Primer or Transbond Plus <b>Self</b> <b>Etching</b> Primer; light-curing resin-modified glass ionomer cement: Fuji Ortho; or self-curing composite: Concise Orthodontic Bonding System). Each group consisted of 15 specimens. Shear bond strength was evaluated after thermo-cycling (10, 000 ×, 5 °C to 55 °C) at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min, and data were statistically analyzed by analysis of variance, Mann-Whitney test, and Weibull statistics. Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI) scores and enamel fractures were determined at 25 × magnification and were statistically analyzed by regression analyses (P <. 05). RESULTS: The caries infiltrant system significantly increased the shear bond strength of Transbond XT Primer, Transbond Plus <b>Self</b> <b>Etching</b> Primer, and Fuji Ortho in sound specimens, and of all resin cements except for the Concise Orthodontic Bonding System in demineralized enamel. Overall, caries infiltrant preconditioning decreased significantly the number of enamel fractures, but it did not affect ARI scores.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the impact of blood {{contamination}} on shear bond strength (SBS) and bond failure pattern of metallic brackets bonded using a new hydrophilic resin. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty human premolars were randomly allocated into 4 groups (n= 20) according to the bonding material and contamination pattern. GI: brackets bonded with the Transbond XT conventional system without contamination; GII: brackets bonded with the Transbond XT conventional system with blood contamination; GIII: brackets bonded with the Transbond <b>Self</b> <b>Etching</b> Primer and Transbond Plus Color without contamination; GIV: brackets bonded with the Transbond <b>Self</b> <b>Etching</b> Primer and Transbond Plus Color with blood contamination. The specimens were stored in distilled water at 37 °C for 24 h and then submitted to SBS test at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min. After bond failure, the enamel surfaces were observed under an optical microscope at 40 x magnification. RESULTS: Blood contamination decreased (P< 0. 05) shear bond strength when both the hydrophobic (GII) and the hydrophilic resin (GIV) were used. However, the bond strength of Transbond Color Change group was significantly higher (P< 0. 05) than that of the Transbond XT conventional system group under blood contamination condition. Under dry conditions no difference was observed between the hydrophobic and hydrophilic resin groups. Regarding the bond failure pattern, when blood contaminated the enamel, the adhesive remnant index (ARI) showed predominance of scores 0 and 1, which indicates low adhesion to enamel. CONCLUSIONS: Although there was a significant decrease in the shear bond strength for both adhesive systems under blood contamination, the hydrophilic system showed significantly higher bond strength than the hydrophobic resin adhesive. Therefore, it is advisable to use the hydrophilic resin under risk of blood contamination...|$|R

This was also observed in the control group; shear bond strength was lower when self-etching primer was used than when phosphoric acid was used, but this difference was statistically insignificant. Previous studies found {{a significant increase in the}} shear bond strength of Transbond XT adhesive with phosphoric acid and Transbond XT primer when ICON was used before bonding orthodontic brackets to sound enamel [[36]] or even to demineralized enamel [[37]]. The shear bond strength was also increased when Transbond Plus <b>Self</b> <b>Etching</b> Primer was used instead of the conventional phosphoric acid etching to sound enamel [[36]]. The shear bond strengths recorded in this study were sufficient for clinical use in all the six groups presenting different combinations of adhesive systems and enamel protective agents as well as control groups. The average range of bond strength was suggested by Reynolds [[38]] to be 5.9 to 7.8  MPa for clinical and 4.9  MPa for laboratory performances. In vitro and in vivo studies of SBS are both needed; in vitro measurements of shear bond strength provide useful information about the bonding efficiency of different types of materials, but the actual performance of these materials can only be evaluated in the environment where they were intended to function [[39]]. Unfortunately, no one variable or combination of variables that can be measured in the laboratory is perfectly predictive of what might occur when the bonding adhesive is used in the demanding environment of the oral cavity [[40]-[42]]. Therefore; in vitro studies are mainly important as a preliminary guide to the clinician, while in vivo studies are needed for evidence-based practice.|$|R
40|$|Aim and Design: The {{requirements}} {{of an effective}} dentin adhesive system include the ability to thoroughly infiltrate the collagen network and partially demineralized zone, to encapsulate the collagen and hydroxyapatite crystallites, to produce a well polymerized durable hybrid layer with high bond strengths. Microleakage and marginal percolation are the most detrimental factors thwarting {{the success of any}} restoration. However, the presence of leakage pathways, called nanoleakage have been observed in the hybrid layer, {{even in the absence of}} microleakage. The nanoleakage patterns of four dentin adhesives (Prime & Bond NT, AdheSE, Clearfil S 3 bond and Fuji Bond LC) was compared using Scanning electron microscopy and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy, by the silver nitrate penetration method. Results and conclusion: The results indicated that etch and rinse adhesives showed the maximum nanoleakage followed by the <b>self</b> <b>etch</b> systems. The glass ionomer based bonding agents showed the least nanoleakage. It is extremely important to take nanoleakage as a consideration while choosing dentin adhesives, to ensure success of the restoration. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

Após limpeza, um dos sistemas adesivos foi aplicado: Clearfil SE Bond (CF), Adper Prompt (AD) ou Scotchbond Multi-Purpose (SB), realizando-se um bloco de resina composta Z 250 de 4 ou 5 mm sobre o adhesivo dental. Após 24 horas de armazenagem, os corpos de prova foram cortados em maquina Labcut, originando palitos com área adesiva de aproximadamente 1 mm 2. Cada palito foi adaptado em um dispositivo de tração, para serem realizados os testes de resistência adesiva. A análise estadística, considerando a cada palito como unidade amostral, e os tipos de fraturas apresentadas, mostrou ausência de diferença entre os sistemas adesivos usados. Entre as técnicas de limpeza testadas, valores de RMT foram superiores para a técnica de PP, não se encontrando diferenças estatisticamente significantes entre B e C. A análise ao MEV da {{interface}} esmalte/resina confirmou os resultados estatísticos encontrados e permitiu observar que a interação resina adhesiva/esmalte ocorre de maneira diferente entre os sistemas <b>self</b> <b>etch</b> e all etch. Concluiu-se que, a técnica PP constitui uma opção adequada de limpeza de superfícies de esmalte liso intacto e que a técnica de bicarbonato pode afetar a resistência adesiva destas superfícies. This study {{evaluated the}} effect of different cleaning techniques in the adhesive bond strength of self-etching bonding systems to unground enamel after being in contact with human saliva. Ninety enamel fragments were obtained from dental crowns (n = 10) and the enamel surface of each fragment were kept in contact with fresh human saliva for 1 hour. Next, they received the cleaning treatment according to the group as follows: pumice and water paste followed by anionic detergent - Tergensol (PP), sodium bicarbonate jet (B), or air/water spray (control group - C). After cleaning procedures, one of the bonding systems was applied: Clearfil SE Bond (CF), Adper Prompt (AD), or Scothbond Multi-Purpose (SB), and a Z 250 composite resin bloc with 4 or 5 mm was built above the dental adhesive. After 24 hours of storage, the specimens were sectioned to obtain sticks with cross sectional areas of approximately 1 mm². The sticks were submitted to microtensile test in an Instron testing machine. Statistical analysis of the results, considering each stick as a sample unit and the fracture kinds presented, showed no statistical significant difference in mean shear bond strength among the bonding systems used. Regarding to the cleaning techniques, shear bond strength values were superior for PP {{and there was no}} significant statistical difference between B and C.

40|$|Introduction: Today a new {{restorative}} resin called “Class V cervical restorative resin” with itsspecific surface sealer “Seal-n-Shine” {{has been}} introduced to use for reducing of micro leakage inclass V restorations. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the influence of surface sealer or self-etchprimer on micro leakage around class V cavities filled with “Class V cervical restorative resin”. •Methods and Materials: In this in vitro experimental study, wedge shaped cavities were prepared onfacial surface of 40 intact premolars, using No. 56 carbide bur. The occlusal margin was prepared inenamel and the cervical margin was in cement. The teeth then were divided into 4 groups of 10. Fourgroups of materials were used, one for each group of the teeth: class V restorative resin; class Vrestorative resin and its specific sealer; <b>self</b> – <b>etch</b> primer of Clearfil SE Bond and Class V restorativeresin; and <b>self</b> – <b>etch</b> primer of Clearfil SE Bond, class V restorative resin and surface sealer ofClearfil SE Bond. Then all the samples were thermo cycled (1500 cycle, 5 - 55). Afterwards they wereplaced in 50 % silver nitrate solution and developing solution, respectively. Finally they were sectionedlongitudinally and were evaluated by stereo-microscope at × 28 magnifications. The data wasanalyzed using Kruskall-Wallis and Man-Whitney tests. •Results: There were no significant differences in micro leakage of enamel margins between the fourgroups. But, considering the dentinal margins, the differences were significant between groups 1, 2; 1, 3; and 1, 4. The differences between the other two paired groups were insignificant. •Conclusion: For decrease of micro leakage, the usage of class V cervical restorative resin per se is noteffective, and it is better to apply its specific sealer (Seal-n-Shine) on the surface of restoration, or aself-etch dentin bonding agent under it. •Key words: Micro leakage, Rebounding, Surface sealant, Self-etch primer, Class V restorations...|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: avaliar a resistência de braquetes metálicos colados em dentes humanos com resina polimerizada com luz halógena por meio de ensaios mecânicos de cisalhamento. METODOLOGIA: para este estudo foram realizados ensaios in vivo com dinamômetro portátil digital e {{in vitro}} com máquina de ensaios mecânicos {{universal}} com e sem termociclagem, complementado pelo Índice de Adesivo Remanescente (IAR). Braquetes Edgewise Standard (Abzil) foram colados utilizando adesivo Transbond Plus <b>Self</b> <b>Etching</b> Primer (SEP) e Resina Transbond XT. Foram formados 3 grupos com 10 dentes em cada um deles. No GI os braquetes foram colados nos segundos pré-molares dos pacientes. Nos GII e GIII utilizaram-se primeiros pré-molares extraídos por motivos ortodônticos. Os ensaios mecânicos do GI foram realizados 24 horas após a polimerização diretamente na boca dos pacientes com dinamômetro portátil digital. No GII os corpos-de-prova foram armazenados em água destilada e levados à estufa a 37 ºC durante 24 horas e, posteriormente, submetidos à termociclagem, com 1000 ciclos a 5 e 55 ºC. No GIII os corpos-de-prova foram armazenados em água destilada em temperatura ambiente por 24 horas e posteriormente submetidos aos ensaios mecânicos. RESULTADOS: os valores médios da resistência ao cisalhamento em Megapascal foram de: GI = 4, 39; GII = 7, 11 e GIII = 7, 35. Após a descolagem foram realizadas fotografias das áreas de colagem, tanto dos dentes submetidos a testes in vivo quanto in vitro e ampliadas 5 x para facilitar a visualização. As imagens obtidas foram analisadas, classificadas de acordo com o IAR e, por meio de gráficos de dispersão, foi verificada a relação entre a resistência ao cisalhamento e este índice. CONCLUSÃO: a média dos ensaios mecânicos realizados in vivo foi estatisticamente menor em relação aos ensaios in vitro. Não houve diferenças na resistência ao cisalhamento in vitro entre o grupo termociclado e o não-termociclado. Não houve relação entre tensão de ruptura e tipo de falha. OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of this}} research was to assess the strength of metallic brackets bonded to human teeth, with lightcuring resin with halogen light, by means of mechanical tests of shear bond strength. METHODS: In vivo tests with a portable digital dynamometer and in vitro tests with Universal testing machine were performed, with and without thermocycling, complemented by Adhesive Remaining Index (ARI). Edgewise standard brackets (Abzil) were bonded using Transbond Plus <b>Self</b> <b>Etching</b> Primer (SEP) and Transbond XT resin. Three groups of ten teeth each have been formed. In GI the brackets were bonded to second premolars in the patients’ mouths. In GII and GIII the brackets were bonded to first premolars extracted for orthodontic reasons. The mechanical tests of GI were performed 24 hours after the polymerization, directly in the patients’ mouths with a portable digital dynamometer. In GII the specimens were stored in distilled water and taken to sterilizer at 37 ºC for 24 hours and afterwards, submitted to thermocycling with 1000 cycles at 5 and 55 º C. In GIII the specimens were stored in distilled water at room temperature for 24 hours, and then submitted to mechanical tests. RESULTS: The average values of the shear strength in Megapascal were: GI= 4. 39; GII= 7. 11 and GIII= 7. 35. Pictures of the bonding areas in both in vivo and in vitro samples were taken after the tests and they were amplified 5 times to be better visualized. The images obtained were analyzed, classified according to IAR and it was verified, by means of dispersion graphs, the relation between the shear bond strength and this index. CONCLUSION: The average of the in vivo mechanical tests was statistically lower than the in vitro tests. There were no differences in the in vitro shear bond strength between the thermocycled and non-thermocycled groups. There was no relation between shearing stress and kind of failure...|$|R
40|$|Purpose:The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the shear bond strength of two adhesion promoters, EnhancetmLC and AssureRUniversal Bonding Resin, and their effects with two different adhesion systems (Light Bondtmand TransbondtmXT). To better understand their behavior upon failure, the amount of adhesive remnant remaining on the tooth surface was also observed. Methods:One-hundred forty human premolars, which were extracted for reasons other than this study, were utilized and divided into seven groups of 20 teeth each. Groups A 1 and B 1 were bonded without adhesion promoters and with two different adhesive systems - Light Bondtmand TransbondtmXT. Groups A 2 and B 2 were bonded using EnhancetmLC. Groups A 3 and B 3 were bonded using AssureRUniversal Bonding Resin. Group C, a third reference control, was bonded with TransbondtmPlus <b>Self</b> <b>Etching</b> Primer, not amenable with the adhesion promoter bonding protocol. A Universal Testing Machine was used to create bond failure and obtain the shear bond strength (SBS). After debonding, teeth and brackets were scored with a modified adhesive remnant index (ARI). Kruskal-Wallis with a Post-Hoc Bonferroni tests were completed on all SBS and ARI data. Results:This study demonstrated that no significant differences were found in SBS of samples bonded with adhesion promoters, relative to their controls. Groups bonded with AssureRUniversal Bonding Resin had significantly higher ARI scores than the control groups and groups bonded with EnhancetmLC. Shear bond Strengths achieved with the self-etching primer were comparable to conventional bond strengths with and without adhesion promoters. ARI scores for the self-etching primer resulted in more adhesive remnant than conventional bonding. Conclusions:The application of adhesion promoters, EnhancetmLC and AssureRUniversal Bonding Resin, did not significantly increase SBS compared to non-adhesion promoter bonding with either adhesive system (TransbondtmXT and Light Bondtm) upon normal enamel. The adhesion promoters did not demonstrate a material-specific predilection for one adhesive system over another. Since groups bonded with AssureRUniversal Bonding Resin had significantly higher ARI scores than control groups and groups bonded with EnhancetmLC, more adhesive removal from the tooth will be required following debonding...|$|R
