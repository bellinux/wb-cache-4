5|$|Van der Sloot's mother, Anita, {{stated in}} a Dutch {{interview}} that her <b>son</b> <b>could</b> have killed Flores {{and that she}} will not visit him at the prison. She said in another interview that she hopes {{to talk to the}} family of the victim and apologize to them.|$|E
5|$|All Bismarck's {{resources}} were deployed; he even asked Empress Victoria {{to use her}} influence with her son on his behalf. But the wizard had lost his magic; his spells were powerless because they were exerted on {{people who did not}} respect them, and he who had so signally disregarded Kant's command to use people as ends in themselves had too small a stock of loyalty to draw on. As Lord Salisbury told Queen Victoria: 'The very qualities which Bismarck fostered in the Emperor in order to strengthen himself when the Emperor Frederick should come to the throne have been the qualities by which he has been overthrown.' The Empress, with what must have been a mixture of pity and triumph, told him that her influence with her <b>son</b> <b>could</b> not save him for he himself had destroyed it.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Michael telegraphed the Tsar requesting permission to return to Russia {{to serve in the}} army, providing his wife and <b>son</b> <b>could</b> come too. Nicholas agreed and Michael travelled back to Saint Petersburg, via Newcastle, Norway, Sweden and Finland. Michael had already leased Paddockhurst in Sussex, an estate larger than Knebworth, and had planned to move there on the expiry of the Knebworth lease. He moved his furniture and furnishings there. The war was not expected to last long and the couple assumed they would be moving back to England at its conclusion. In the meantime, Michael offered its use to the British military. At Saint Petersburg, now named Petrograd, they moved into a villa at 24 Nikolaevskaya street, Gatchina, that Michael had bought for Natalia. Natalia was not permitted to live in any of the imperial palaces.|$|E

50|$|The kingdom {{started after}} king Jayayakshya Malla divided his kingdom {{so that his}} <b>sons</b> <b>could</b> be the rulers of their own kingdom. After its formation, the kingdom {{replaced}} Bhaktapur as the main trading center.|$|R
5|$|When sons of an epikleros came of age, {{they gained}} the {{ownership}} of the inheritance. In Athens, this age was given in an extant law, and was two years {{past the age of}} puberty of the son. In Solon's laws, it appears that the eldest son of the epikleros was considered the heir of his maternal grandfather, with any further sons being considered part of their father's household. The son's inheritance of his maternal grandfather's property happened whether or not his father and mother were alive, unlike most other inheritances. And the son of an epikleros did not inherit anything from his father, and was named after his grandfather. The heir could further consolidate his position by being posthumously adopted by his maternal grandfather, but this was not required. By the 4th century BCE, legal practices had changed, and the <b>son</b> <b>could</b> also inherit from his father, as well as from his maternal grandfather. And if there was more than one son, they divided the estate passed by the epikleros between themselves. After the heir secured possession of his inheritance, the law specified that he was to support his mother. It is likely that the debts of the grandfather were also inherited along with any property.|$|E
25|$|In certain {{sections}} of the pre-Islamic Arab tradition, the <b>son</b> <b>could</b> inherit his deceased father's other wives (i.e. not his own mother) as a wife. The Qur'an prohibited this practice.|$|E
25|$|The 2011 Yemeni {{revolution}} followed other Arab Spring mass {{protests in}} early 2011. The uprising was initially against unemployment, economic conditions, and corruption, {{as well as}} against the government's proposals to modify the constitution of Yemen so that Saleh's <b>son</b> <b>could</b> inherit the presidency.|$|E
60|$|Emily Lester bore these reproaches {{from the}} grief-stricken soul. She was sure--all {{the people of}} Havenpool were sure--that Shadrach and his <b>sons</b> <b>could</b> not return. For years the vessel had been given up as lost.|$|R
50|$|In 1815, {{the year}} after his marriage, Chambers left London for Worcester, where he {{remained}} for nearly eight years. He moved to his wife's home at Wymondham, and after about two years, settled at Norwich, so that his <b>sons</b> <b>could</b> attend the grammar school there.|$|R
50|$|In 1563, the Statute of Artificers and Apprentices {{was passed}} to {{regulate}} {{and protect the}} apprenticeship system, forbidding anyone from practising a trade or craft without first serving a 7-year period as an apprentice to a master (though in practice Freemen's <b>sons</b> <b>could</b> negotiate shorter terms).|$|R
25|$|A {{craftsman}} often {{adopted a}} son {{to learn the}} craft. He profited by the son's labour. If he failed to teach his son the craft, that <b>son</b> <b>could</b> prosecute him and get the contract annulled. This {{was a form of}} apprenticeship, and {{it is not clear whether}} the apprentice had any filial relation.|$|E
25|$|The parable {{begins with}} a young man, the younger of two sons, who asks his father to give him {{his share of the}} estate. The {{implication}} is the <b>son</b> <b>could</b> not wait for his father's death for his inheritance, he wanted it immediately. The father agrees and divides his estate between both sons.|$|E
25|$|McLaren's father, James, {{said that}} the truth was {{inconvenient}} for the army; pointing out that if his <b>son</b> <b>could</b> {{get out of the}} base undetected, someone could get in. He also {{said that the}} typical wait for a service family to have an inquest into a death would be two years; his son's inquest came after only 5 months.|$|E
50|$|He {{was married}} in 1885 to Irene Olympiti (1869/70-1908 Paris, {{daughter}} of Emmanuel Olympiti, mayor of Kalymnos), {{a woman from}} the island of Kalymnos who had a plot of land in Myndos (Gümüşlük) but he later moved to Chios and Lesbos so that his <b>sons</b> <b>could</b> attend high school there.|$|R
25|$|Emanuel was {{the eldest}} of three sons born to Rabbi Joseph H. Feldman, a native of Warsaw and scion of a rabbinical family. Joseph Feldman served as a rabbi in Manchester, New Hampshire in the 1930s, but left that post to assume the helm of Baltimore's Franklin Street Synagogue so his <b>sons</b> <b>could</b> attend a Hebrew day school.|$|R
50|$|According to chronicles, Euphrosyne {{wished for}} her sons to inherit {{the lands of}} their father, but they would not inherit because of their two elder half-brothers. Euphrosyne wanted to poison her two stepsons so that her own <b>sons</b> <b>could</b> inherit Casimir's lands. This plot would explain a revolt of the two boys against their father, Casimir.|$|R
25|$|The electoral dignity was {{connected}} {{with it the}} obligation of male primogeniture; that is, only the eldest <b>son</b> <b>could</b> succeed as ruler. This forbade {{the division of the}} territory among several heirs, preventing the disintegration of the country. The importance of this stipulation is shown by the history of most of the fragmented German principalities (e.g. the Saxon Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg) which were not electorates.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, none of Gardner's {{co-workers}} {{knew that}} he and his son were homeless in the Tenderloin District of San Francisco for nearly a year. Gardner often scrambled to place his child in daycare, stood in soup kitchens and slept wherever he and his <b>son</b> <b>could</b> find safety—in his office after hours, at flophouses, motels, parks, airports, on public transport, and even in a locked bathroom at a BART station.|$|E
25|$|What {{started as}} a jazz club {{eventually}} became a hangout for skiffle groups. Whilst playing golf with Sytner's father, Dr. Joseph Sytner, Nigel Walley—who had left school at 15 to become an apprentice golf professional at the Lee Park Golf Club—asked Dr. Sytner if his <b>son</b> <b>could</b> book The Quarrymen at The Cavern, {{which was one of}} three jazz clubs he managed. Dr. Sytner suggested that the band should play at the golf club first, so as to assess their talent. After performing at the golf club Sytner phoned Walley a week later and offered the band an interlude spot playing skiffle between the performances of two jazz bands at The Cavern, on Wednesday, 7 August 1957.|$|E
5000|$|The Ottoman Interregnum, from 8 March 1403 until 1413, {{a result}} of the death of Sultan Bayezid I at the hands of Central Asian warlord Timur. A period of civil war ensued as none of Bayezid's <b>sons</b> <b>could</b> {{establish}} primacy. The crisis was resolved when one of his sons, Mehmed, defeated and killed his brothers and reestablished the Empire.|$|R
50|$|DePaul {{recently}} announced that the basketball court at McGrath Arena will be named the Doug Bruno Court in his honor. The decision was kept a surprise, and announced at the annual Doug Bruno Challenge Dinner. Doug was told the dinner attendance wasn't meeting expectations, and asked if his six <b>sons</b> <b>could</b> help bolster the attendance by showing up and bringing friends.|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 2006, Camp Dudley {{acquired}} a sister camp in Colchester, Vermont called Camp Dudley at Kiniya, after purchasing the former Camp Kiniya from the Williams family. A driving force in this expansion was for the daughters of Camp Dudley alumni {{to have a place}} to learn the same ethics and values that their <b>sons</b> <b>could</b> learn at Camp Dudley.|$|R
25|$|In 1987, {{seven years}} {{after the release of}} the motion picture, Simon Hawke {{produced}} a novelization of Friday the 13th. One of the few additions to the book was Mrs. Voorhees begging the Christy family to take her back after the loss of her son; they agreed. Another addition in the novel is more understanding in Mrs. Voorhees' actions. Hawke felt the character had attempted to move on when Jason died, but her psychosis got the best of her. When Steve Christy reopened the camp, Mrs. Voorhees saw it as a chance that what happened to her <b>son</b> <b>could</b> happen again. Her murders were against the counselors, because she saw them all as responsible for Jason's death.|$|E
25|$|Lupin remains {{active in}} the Order {{throughout}} the year. He provides the casualty reports section on the pirate radio station Potterwatch under the pseudonym of Romulus. Lupin commands a group of defenders on the school grounds during the Battle of Hogwarts. Both Lupin and Tonks die in combat, killed by Antonin Dolohov and Bellatrix Lestrange respectively. At {{the time of his}} death, Lupin was the last surviving member of his group of friends. Rowling has since stated that she originally intended for both Lupin and Tonks to survive, but finally killed them off to compensate for the last-minute reprieve she gave to Arthur Weasley in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Lupin, along with Sirius, James, and Lily, makes one last appearance in the series when Harry uses the Resurrection Stone to bring them forth to comfort him. He expresses his regret that Teddy will never know his father, but says that he will know why he died: trying to make a world in which his <b>son</b> <b>could</b> live a better life.|$|E
500|$|Coloman had his four-year-old son Stephen crowned in 1105, {{which caused}} Álmos to openly rebel against the king. The duke left Hungary and sought the {{assistance}} of Emperor HenryIV. Having realized that the emperor, who was facing a rebellion of his own <b>son,</b> <b>could</b> not help him, Álmos returned to Hungary in 1106, but then fled to his brother-in-law, Boleslaw III of Poland. With Polish assistance he captured the fortress of Abaújvár in Hungary. Coloman {{had a meeting with}} BoleslawIII, and the two monarchs [...] "vowed perpetual friendship and brotherhood". Without the Polish monarch's support, Álmos was forced to yield to Coloman.|$|E
5000|$|Due to an {{insufficient}} {{stock of}} paper, the British printer Harrison and <b>Sons</b> <b>could</b> not deliver in time a stamp issue ordered for Somaliland. Because {{of the lack}} of postage stamps there, it was decided to overprint [...] "REPUBLIC / OF / SOMALILAND / 500 SHILLIN" [...] 4'300 British one penny definitive stamps available at Harrison. The overprint was applied in Somaliland.|$|R
50|$|Sharp {{lived and}} worked in Hull for four years before ending up in Rugby so that his <b>sons</b> <b>could</b> attend Rugby School.

Sharp resigned in 1850 to return to medicine and research.|$|R
25|$|Welsh law {{was still}} used for civil {{cases such as}} land inheritance, contracts, sureties and similar matters, though with changes, for example illegitimate <b>sons</b> <b>could</b> no longer claim part of the inheritance. The Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542 brought Wales entirely under English law; when the 1535 Act {{declares}} the intention utterly to extirpe alle and singular sinister usages and customs belonging to Wales, Welsh law was probably the main target.|$|R
500|$|The 1993 film Searching for Bobby Fischer uses Fischer's {{name in the}} title, {{even though}} the film is {{about the life of}} chess prodigy Joshua Waitzkin. Outside of the United States, it was {{released}} as Innocent Moves. The title refers to the search for Fischer's successor after his disappearance from competitive chess. The author feels that his <b>son</b> <b>could</b> be that successor. Fischer never saw the film and complained bitterly that it was an invasion of his privacy by using his name without his permission. Fischer never received any compensation from the film, calling it [...] "a monumental swindle".|$|E
500|$|Attempts to find {{sources for}} the work in {{literature}} from the period have not been successful. Art historian Erwin Panofsky wrote in 1953 that, [...] "In {{spite of all the}} ingenious, erudite and in part extremely useful research devoted to the task of [...] "decoding Jerome Bosch", I cannot help feeling that the real secret of his magnificent nightmares and daydreams has still to be disclosed. We have bored a few holes through the door of the locked room; but somehow we do not seem to have discovered the key." [...] The humanist Desiderius Erasmus has been suggested as a possible influence; the writer lived in 's-Hertogenbosch in the 1480s, and it is likely he knew Bosch. Glum remarked on the triptych's similarity of tone with Erasmus's view that theologians [...] "explain (to suit themselves) the most difficult mysteries... is it a possible proposition: God the Father hates the <b>Son?</b> <b>Could</b> God have assumed the form of a woman, a devil, an ass, a gourd, a stone?" ...|$|E
500|$|Further {{unification}} of the Lithuanian tribes was {{facilitated by the}} social changes {{that took place in}} Lithuania during this period. Private land ownership was established (allodiums, Lithuanian: atolai), which would later evolve into a feudal system. As attested by many chronicles, it was the principal form of organization governing land ownership in the 13th century. Under this system, known in England as primogeniture, only the eldest <b>son</b> <b>could</b> inherit lands, which allowed dukes to consolidate their holdings. Social classes and divisions of labor also began taking shape. There were classes of experienced soldiers (bajoras), of free peasants (laukininkas), and of [...] "unfree" [...] people (kaimynas and šeimynykštis). In order to enforce this social structure, a united state was needed. Another force behind unification was the desire to take advantage of Ruthenian lands, which were suffering from the Mongol invasion. Temporary alliances among Lithuanian dukes often sufficed for military ventures into, and plundering of, these lands (including Pskov, plundered in 1213). Altogether, between 1201 and 1236, Lithuanians launched at least 22 incursions into Livonia, 14 into Rus, and 4 into Poland. The ongoing administration of conquered territories, however, required a strong and unified central power.|$|E
50|$|After {{inspecting}} three mummies {{from ancient}} Egyptian catacombs, Morton concluded that Caucasians and Negroes were already distinct three thousand years ago. Since the Bible indicated that Noah's Ark had {{washed up on}} Mount Ararat, only {{a thousand years ago}} before this, Morton claimed that Noah's <b>sons</b> <b>could</b> not possibly account for every race on earth. According to Morton's theory of polygenesis, races have been separate since the start.|$|R
50|$|Ansgarde {{was thus}} repudiated, {{but at the}} death of Louis II in 879 she worked to ensure that her <b>sons</b> <b>could</b> mount the throne of France themselves. To that end, she sought to revisit the subject of her divorce with the {{archbishop}} of Reims. Adélaïde, however, was pregnant, and {{gave birth to a}} son on September 17 of that year, which thus called into doubt the inheritance of Ansgarde's own sons.|$|R
