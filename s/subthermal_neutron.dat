40|$|In dual-energy {{hydrogen}} imaging, {{the increase}} in hydrogen neutron cross-section at <b>subthermal</b> <b>neutron</b> energies is used to enhance the imaging of small amounts of hydrogen {{against a background of}} other absorbing materials by subtracting a tomographic image obtained for higher energy neutrons from that obtained for subthermal neutrons (picking energies such that the other absorbing materials have nearly the same cross-sections at both energies). This technique was used to provide dual-energy imaging of water in tuffaceous rock, with the goal being to track water flow through porous rock for site risk analysis of permanent disposal of radwaste. A feasibility experiment was conducted at the IPNS facility with coarse spatial resolution, yielding promising results...|$|E
40|$|Spectra of two-step γ cascades {{following}} {{neutron capture}} in 155, 157 Gd were measured using the two- HPGe-detector facility installed at a pure <b>subthermal</b> <b>neutron</b> beam of the LVR- 15 reactor in ˇež near Prague. The main {{objective of this}} experiment was to get new information on photon strength functions with the emphasis put {{on the role of}} M 1 scissors mode vibration. An analysis of accumulated γ-ray spectra, made within the statistical model, leads {{to the conclusion that the}} scissors mode significantly affects γ decay of all states of studied nuclei. The obtained results for energy, damping width and summed B(M 1) ↑ strength of the scissors mode are compared with what has been deduced from neutron capture experiments performed at DANCE detector installed in Los Alamos National Laboratory, NRF data for the ground state scissors mode and from the data on 3 He-induced reactions using the so-called Oslo method...|$|E
40|$|A new {{two-dimensional}} position-sensitive detector {{system for}} small-angle neutron scattering experiments is under development. It {{is based on}} a 60 x 60 cm(2) large Li- 6 -glass scintillator for the neutron capture and dispersion of the emitted light on an array of photomultiplier tubes for the derivation of the event position. For <b>subthermal</b> <b>neutrons</b> of 8 Angstrom, an efficiency of 96 % and a spatial resolution of 8 mm are to be achieved. Major improvements {{have been made in the}} signal- and data-processing branch, which aims at an electronical dead time of 1 mus. A fast digitalization method using free-running analog-to-digital converters for each photomultiplier combined with field-programmable gate arrays for a parallel event detection in all channels has been applied. A subsequent farm of up to 16 floating-point digital signal processors is used to provide enough computing power for an improved reconstruction of the event position according to a maximum likelihood method...|$|R
40|$|Two {{potential}} {{cold moderator}} materials were studied: ethane and triphenylmethane. The first one, ethane (C 2 H 6), is an organic compound {{which is very}} interesting from the neutronic point of view, in some respects better than liquid methane to produce <b>subthermal</b> <b>neutrons,</b> {{not only because it}} remains in liquid phase through a wider temperature range (Tf = 90. 4 [*]K, Tb = 184. 6 [*]K), but also because of its high protonic density together with its frequency spectrum with a low rotational energy band. Another material, Triphenylmethane is an hydrocarbon with formula C 19 H 16 which has already been proposed as a good candidate for a cold moderator. Following one of the main research topics of the Neutron Physics Department of Centro Atómico Bariloche, we present here two ways to estimate the frequency spectrum which is needed to feed the NJOY nuclear data processing system in order to generate the scattering law of each desired material. For ethane, computer simulations of molecular dynamics were done, while for triphenylmethane existing experimental and calculated data were used to produce a new scattering kernel. With these models, cross section libraries were generated, and applied to neutron spectra calculation...|$|R
40|$|The Advanced Neutron Source (ANS) {{is being}} {{designed}} as a user-oriented neutron research laboratory centered around the most intense continuous beams of thermal and <b>subthermal</b> <b>neutrons</b> in the world (an order of magnitude more intense than beams available from the most advanced existing reactors). The ANS will be built around a new research reactor of 330 -MW fission power, producing an unprecedented peak thermal flux of > 7 {center_dot} 10 {sup 19 } {center_dot} m{sup - 2 } {center_dot} s{sup - 1 }. Primarily a research facility, the ANS will accommodate more than 1000 academic, industrial, and government researchers each year. They will conduct basic research in all branches of science as well as applied research leading to better understanding of new materials, including high temperature super conductors, plastics, and thin films. Some 48 neutron beam stations will be {{set up in the}} ANS beam rooms and the neutron guide hall for neutron scattering and for fundamental and nuclear physics research. There also will be extensive facilities for materials irradiation, isotope production, and analytical chemistry. The top level work breakdown structure (WBS) for the project. As noted in this figure, one component of the project is a research and development (R&D) program (WBS 1. 1). This program interfaces with all of the other project level two WBS activities. Because one of the project guidelines is to meet minimum performance goals without relying on new inventions, this R&D activity is not intended to produce new concepts to allow the project to meet minimum performance goals. Instead, the R&D program will focus on the four objectives described...|$|R
