40|$|We {{provide a}} {{complete}} description {{of one of}} the oldest plesiosaurians, Stratesaurus taylori from the earliest Hettangian of the United Kingdom. At least 25 apomorphies distinguish S. taylori from the sympatric Thalassiodracon hawkinsii, to which all three specimens of S. taylori were originally referred. Several features of the skull of S. taylori suggest specialization on small prey items, or <b>sieve</b> <b>feeding.</b> In particular, it has anteriorly inclined premaxillary and mesial maxillary teeth and an only weakly heterodont maxillary dentition. This indicates niche partitioning among sympatric small-bodied plesiosaurians: T. hawkinsii has a pronouncedly heterodont dentition. With a body length estimated around 2 m, S. taylori is one of the smallest plesiosaurians, comparable to T. hawkinsii. Our anatomical review of S. taylori suggests difficulty determining its precise phylogenetic affinities. This is consistent with a general lack of phylogenetic resolution among earliest Jurassic plesiosaurians, which may result from missing data on their Triassic ancestry. However, due to its plesiomorphic morphology and well-characterized anatomy, we recommend S. taylori as an ingroup representative of Plesiosauria for future cladistic analyses of Triassic sauropterygians...|$|E
30|$|The {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} in a 700  m 2 earthen pond with a depth of 2  m. A series of 21 hapa net cages with 2.0  mm mesh size were placed in the pond and were used to hold the fish. The hapa net cages were rectangular (2  ×  3  m ×  2  m deep) and were suspended by tying them to four melaleuca poles. One feeding <b>sieve</b> (<b>feeding</b> trap), 30  cm in diameter, was placed in each hapa net cage to retain feed and to prevent feed falling to the bottom. The feed was distributed to each feeding sieve using a small boat. All feeding sieves and happa net cages were scrubbed and cleaned monthly to remove moss and muddy slime from the mesh. The pond was prepared before the experiment by removing wastewater and pond sediments and left empty to dry for about 2  weeks. The bottom sediments of the pond were treated with 30 – 40  kg lime and left to dry for a week before river water was pumped into the pond. About 20  % of the water in the pond was replaced by new water from the river every 2  weeks during the experiment.|$|E
40|$|The {{evolution}} {{and function of}} the long neck in plesiosaurs, and how {{the problems associated with}} stiffness or flexibility were overcome during feeding, or rapid swimming during predator avoidance, are explored, and a new interpretation for the function of the plesiosaur neck is presented. Based on the anatomy of the articular faces of contiguous cervical vertebral centra, neural arches, and cervical ribs, the plesiosaur neck was mainly adapted for ventral bending, with dorsal, lateral and rotational movements all relatively restricted. Predominant ventral bending indicates the neck was adapted for use beneath the body, suggesting feeding in the water column, close to the sea floor, or within soft sediments on the sea floor. A new model is proposed for the plesiosaur bauplan, comprising the head as a filter, straining, <b>sieve</b> <b>feeding</b> or sediment raking apparatus, mounted on a neck which acted as a stiff but ventrally flexible feeding tube, attached to the body which acted as a highly mobile feeding platform. Numerous features of plesiosaurs, including cranial and dental form, cervical vertebral morphology, body shape and limb-based propulsion, conform to this model. Comparative data from modern organisms support this novel explanation for the structure and function of the plesiosaur long neck. This integrative analysis offers an explanation for the evolution of the plesiosaur long neck as a key evolutionary novelty, and why this apparently enigmatic feature remained a prominent feature of plesiosaurs throughout their long evolutionary history...|$|E

40|$|Grinding is a unit {{operation}} to break big solid material into smaller pieces. As far as process of grinding is concerned, power consumption, specific energy consumption and {{particle size distribution}} and mill capacity are main considerations from engineering point of view. The experiments were conducted to study the effect of speed of mill, <b>sieve</b> size, <b>feed</b> rate and time of grinding on power consumption and average particle diameter of water chestnut in continuous grinding process. Power consumption was measured for a constant feed rate of 1 and 2 kg/h at different speed of the mill varied from 800 to 1200 rpm for the sieve openings of 0. 5 mm, 1. 0 mm and 2. 0 mm. For all the <b>sieve</b> sizes and <b>feed</b> rates, {{it was observed that}} as the speed of the mill increases, there is an increase in power consumption and found significantly low for higher sieve size and lower feed rate. The size distribution of the water chestnut kernel for different speeds and sieve sizes at constant feed rate were obtained by sieve analysis. The milling speed has no significant effect on particle size distribution of ground product and mass fraction was minimum at lower feed rate and higher sieve size. Harris model was found best suitable to describe the size distribution in continuous grinding process. Fineness modulus decreases with increase of milling speed for experimental <b>sieve</b> size and <b>feed</b> rate...|$|R
40|$|Swine research, 2005 {{is known}} as Swine day, 2005 Three {{experiments}} were conducted to evaluate the Bygholm <b>Feed</b> <b>Sieve</b> particle size tester. The Bygholm <b>Feed</b> <b>Sieve</b> is an 11 inch × 2. 25 inch × 4. 25 inch plastic box divided into four compartments by three different screen sizes (3, 000 -, 2, 000 -, and 1, 000 -micron mesh). In Experiment 1, particle size was determined for 20 ground corn samples with a Ro-Tap 13 -sieve stack (53 - to 3, 350 -micron Tyler mesh screens). The particle sizes ranged from 543 to 1, 741 microns. Samples were analyzed for particle size with the standard Bygholm <b>Feed</b> <b>Sieve,</b> operated according to the manufacturer’s directions. In Experiment 2, two rubber balls {{were placed on the}} 2, 000 micron screen and one ball was placed on the 1, 000 micron screen in the Bygholm <b>Feed</b> <b>Sieve</b> to aid in moving particles through the screens. Samples were then analyzed for particle size, according to the manufacturer’s directions. In Experiment 3, 24 additional samples with particle sizes ranging from 604 to 1, 305 microns were analyzed to determine the accuracy of the regression equation created by Experiment 1. After initial analysis indicated that the equation didn’t accurately predict particle size of samples with a large particle size, an additional 11 samples with particle sizes ranging from 1, 054 to 1, 741 microns were analyzed. After this analysis, all samples from Experiments 1 and 3 were used to develop a new set of regression equations to calculate the particle size of samples over a wider micron range. The Bygholm <b>Feed</b> <b>Sieve</b> more accurately predicted the particle size of samples when rubber balls were not present within the system (R² = 0. 88 versus 0. 82). The regression equation created by Experiment 1 predicted 90 % of the samples to be within 100 microns of the actual particle size when the samples were less than 1, 000 microns. When samples are coarser than 1, 000 microns, however, the regression equation created by Experiment 3 should be used; it predicts 85 % of the samples to be within 100 microns of the actual particle size when the samples were larger than 1, 000 microns and 98 % of all samples to be within 150 microns of the actual particle size...|$|R
40|$|A conical {{suspended}} sieve, with oscillatory circular motion, {{was tested}} for rapeseeds screening, {{in order to}} estimate the influence of oscillation parameters on the separation process. Amplitude and frequency of oscillation were modified, {{as well as the}} feed flow with material. Distribution curves were drawn for the separated seeds under the sieve for various distanced from the top edge of the <b>sieve,</b> where <b>feeding</b> was made. By regression analysis by means of Gauss distribution law, were determined the coefficients of distribution function and the correlation with the experimental data. By determining the position of the peak of distribution curve depending on the working regime parameters was estimated the influence of oscillation amplitude on the process of seeds separation...|$|R
5000|$|Flux {{is defined}} as the amount of a desired {{component}} (undersize material) that has carried over the screening media from the feed per time per unit area. Screening efficiency is expressed as the ratio of the amount of material that actually passes through the aperture, divided by the amount in the feed that theoretically should pass. Commercially perfect screening is considered to be 95% efficient [...] if the process is operated with appropriate feed concentration and size particles. Generally, a suitable particle size difference between <b>sieving</b> and <b>feed</b> should be no more than 30%. High screening efficiency can reduce the qualified gain content in cyclic loading and screening and thus increasing the processing capacity of the mill.|$|R
40|$|Penaeus monodon larvae were stocked in 20 -l conical {{plexiglass}} {{tanks in}} a water bath. Larvae were reared from protozoea to mysis I using feeds in combination with Tetraselmis sp. and Tetraselmis sp. alone. The feeds used were hard cooked ckicken egg yolk, beaten whole egg cooked in boiling water, cooked brown mussel, trash fish and soybean cake. Feeds were homogenized and pass through a 40 Âµm <b>sieve</b> prior to <b>feeding.</b> Three experimental runs were carried out. Survival of the fed with various feeds had no significant differences at the mysis stage.

5000|$|Little {{is known}} of the life habits of Lasiognathus. William Beebe speculated in 1930 that the fishing {{apparatus}} of Lasiognathus might [...] "be cast swiftly ahead, when then the hooks and the lights would so frighten any pursued fish that they would hesitate {{long enough to be}} engulfed in the onrushing maw," [...] though Richard Ellis considered this scenario unlikely. Nolan and Rosenblatt (1975) echoed Beebe's skepticism that the hooks were actually used to hook prey, though they proposed that [...] "squid tentacles could conceivably be impaled on the hooks and the prey thus secured". It has also been proposed that Lasiognathus might form its mouth into a sort of <b>sieve</b> for filter <b>feeding.</b> More likely, prey is simply attracted by the glowing esca to within range of the jaws.|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceBiochemistry and Molecular Biophysics Interdepartmental ProgramGerald ReeckPea aphids (Acyrthosiphon pisum) are sap-sucking {{insects that}} {{feed on the}} phloem sap of some plants of the family Fabaceae (legumes). Aphids feed on host plants by {{inserting}} their stylets between plant cells to feed from phloem sap in <b>sieve</b> elements. Their <b>feeding</b> is of major agronomical importance, as aphids cause {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars in crop damage worldwide, annually. Salivary gland transcripts from plant-fed and diet-fed pea aphids were studied by RNASeq to analyze their expression. Most transcripts had higher expression in plant-fed pea aphids, likely due to the need for saliva protein in the aphid/plant interaction. Numerous salivary gland transcripts and saliva proteins have been identified in aphids, including a glutathione peroxidase. Glutathione peroxidases are a group of enzymes with the purpose of protecting organisms from oxidative damage. Here, I present a bioinformatic analysis of pea aphid expressed sequence tag libraries that identified four unique glutathione peroxidases in pea aphids. One glutathione peroxidase, ApGPx 1 has high expression in the pea aphid salivary gland. Two glutathione peroxidase genes are present in the current annotation of the pea aphid genome. My work indicates that the two genes need to be revised...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} believed that an osmotically generated pressure gradient drives the phloem mass flow. So far, this widely accepted Münch theory has required remarkably few adaptations, but {{the debate on}} alternative and additional hypotheses is still ongoing. Recently, a possible shortcoming of the Münch theory has been pointed out, suggesting that the Münch pressure flow is more suitable for herbs than for trees. Estimation of the phloem resistance indicates that a point might be reached in long sieve tubes where the pressure required to drive the Münch flow cannot be generated. Therefore, the relay hypothesis regained belief as it implies that the sieve tubes are shorter then the plant’s axial axis. In the source phloem, three different loading strategies exist which probably result from evolutionary advantages. Passive diffusion {{seems to be the}} most primitive one, whereas active loading strategies substantially increase the growth potential. Along the transport phloem, a leakage-retrieval mechanism is observed. Appreciable amounts of carbohydrates are lost from the <b>sieve</b> tubes to <b>feed</b> the lateral sinks, while a part of these lost carbohydrates is subsequently reloaded into the sieve tubes. This mechanism is probably involved to buffer short-term irregularities in phloem turgor and gradient. In the long term, the mechanism controls the replenishment and remobilization of lateral stem storage tissues. As phloem of higher plants has multiple functions in plant development, reproduction, signalling, and growth, the fundamental understanding of the mechanisms behind phloem transport should be elucidated to increase our ability to influence plant growth and development...|$|R
