2500|$|Bisbee {{was asked}} the same question, but {{preferred}} {{to focus on the}} facts of his case. He stressed that [...] "hat was reported to them was basically a headline: 'Things were bad in OB and the administration was responsible.'" [...] Justice Sandra Day O'Connor asked about the Pickering test: [...] "Do you think that even protected speech could also serve to demonstrate sufficient disruption to the employer's operation that a firing could be justified?" [...] Bisbee conceded that it could, but [...] "it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> has got to be some reasonable basis for thinking that the speech was doing that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know yet," [...] Tucker replied. [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> {{is nothing}} left of me. I am sore and smarting all over. How are you, Arthur?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know {{anything}} about property," [...] he admitted. [...] "Never owned a yard of land in my life. Yet it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> must be a hitch somewhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I shouldn't wonder,' said White dryly, it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>There</b> was {{something}} distinctly odd in his manner. 'And you're going after them.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{has never}} done you any harm, Mr. Hawtrey?' Captain Hamilton asked, 'because {{certainly}} it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> was a ring of triumphant malice in his voice.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> was sulphur in the air, so I {{talked for}} talking," [...] {{returned}} the other. [...] "But {{it was none}} of it nonsense." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I know,' he said, 'it just doesn't centre. The old ideals {{are dead}} as nails--nothing there. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> remains only this perfect union with a woman--sort of {{ultimate}} marriage--and there isn't anything else.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well,” said Tony, “I don’t quite know. I don’t worry {{over those}} questions, but it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> is {{something}} to be said for the man who does what he shouldn’t when he can’t help it.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{want to make}} thirty {{thousand}} dollars as soon as I can, and it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> {{are going to be}} opportunities in this business. Do you know anybody who would take me as clerk or salesman?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who {{breaks the}} Law--" [...] said Moreau, {{taking his eyes}} off his victim, and turning towards us (it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> was a touch of exultation in his voice).|$|R
60|$|It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> {{was little}} {{need for such}} caution. The traitor was yet gagged, and strive as he might {{could not have done}} other than moan ever so softly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is {{there no}} one else who could do that?" [...] Acton asked. [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there's</b> {{nothing wrong with that}} man Gordon. I guess you could leave it to him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Alton simply. [...] "What {{would any}} son do? But it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> {{might be a}} little {{allowance}} for my grandfather, too, and I think he and my father have fixed up that quarrel long ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Social Service--education. Whatever else matters or doesn't matter, it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> is {{one thing}} we MUST have and increase, {{and that is the}} number of people who can think a little--and have"--he beamed again--"an {{adequate}} sense of causation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Still, you can’t keep {{everything}} from him,” Osborne persisted. “It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> {{are too many}} people who must, to some extent, be taken into your confidence. That’s where Farquhar has the advantage. He has only two partners, whom he can rely upon.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there's</b> reason enough: our {{paths in}} life are so different." [...] Nick's friend {{had a great deal}} of manner, as was evinced by his fashion of saluting Biddy without knowing her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you find}} it so? It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there's</b> a great difference. I can imagine {{that at the end}} of ten years we might have a very {{pleasant}} correspondence. I shall have matured my epistolary style." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Gabbitas played {{round her}} politely, {{and opened the}} door for her and {{conducted}} her into the passage, and for a moment or so I had the fullest sense of proximity <b>to</b> those--it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> must be ten or twelve--sovereigns. [...] .|$|R
60|$|The {{physicians}} {{think they}} are moved by regard for {{the best interests of}} the public. Isn't there a little touch of self-interest back of it all? It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> is, and I don't claim to have all the virtues--only nine or ten of them.|$|E
6000|$|... "'If you've {{got to get}} rid of your excess verbiage,' says I, 'why not go out on {{the river}} bank and speak a piece? It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> was an old spell-binder named Cantharides that used to go and disincorporate himself of his windy numbers along the seashore.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Jim, I {{left the}} boards when--when I was weary of them. But {{my heart goes}} back to them sometimes. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> is no smell {{like that of the}} hot oil in the footlights and of the oranges in the pit. But you are sad, Jim." ...|$|E
60|$|Merciless {{and cruel}} her {{features}} <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>There</b> was no pity, no love, not {{a shadow of}} response to my half-formed, appealing gesture. I let her go and sank back upon my pillows, weeping bitterly, with {{a deep sense of}} utter loneliness and desolation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps you are right, Mr Saunders," [...] {{replied the}} captain, smiling; [...] "nevertheless I shall take {{observations}} and name the various headlands until I find {{that others have}} been here before me. Mivins, hand me the glass; it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there's</b> a water-sky <b>to</b> the northward." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay--I'll be thankfu' for a bite o' somethin', for I'm fair famished; an' there's a proverb, I think, {{that says}} it's ill fechtin' on an emp'y stammack. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there's</b> less order an' mair noise yonder than befits a camp o' serious men--specially on a Sabbath mornin'." ...|$|R
6000|$|In his [...] "Colin Clout," [...] written {{just after}} his return to Ireland, he speaks of the Court {{in a tone of}} contemptuous bitterness, in which, as it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>there</b> is more of the sorrow of disillusion than of the gall of {{personal}} disappointment. He speaks, so he tells us,-- ...|$|E
60|$|But it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>there</b> is {{no small}} error even in this last and more {{philosophical}} theory. I believe, that what it is most honorable to know, it is also most profitable to learn; and that the science which it is the highest power to possess, {{it is also the}} best exercise to acquire.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it {{does look}} so, Harry; but perhaps, on {{examining}} it closely, one would find {{that it is not}} so strong as it looks, by a long way. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> must be some way or other of getting father out, and, if there seems even the least bit of a chance, I shall try it." ...|$|E
60|$|It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that <b>there</b> is an ugly cloud {{gathering}} on {{the political}} horizon in Natal.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've been {{wondering}} where this trail goes, and it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there's</b> an opening close {{in front of}} us," [...] he said. [...] "We'll rest when we get there, and I don't know that I'll be sorry. You {{have to choose between}} stewing and roasting in this country, and, when it lets my skin stay on me, I almost think the latter's easier." ...|$|R
60|$|It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that <b>there</b> {{was a sort}} of {{something}} in her voice, a kind of thingummy, you know.|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean they'll now be of {{a totally}} {{different}} order," [...] Wayworth explained. [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> can be {{nothing in the world}} more difficult than to write a play that will stand an all-round test, and that in comparison with them the complications that spring up at this point are of an altogether smaller kind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not harshly. I {{feel very}} {{compassionate}} towards him. But now, even {{as to what}} one might consider the most real thing in his life,--his caring for you,--it <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> {{must have been a}} great share of imagined sentiment in it. It was not a passion; it was a gentle nature's dream of a passion." ...|$|E
6000|$|Nasmyth smiled good-humouredly. [...] "Well," [...] he replied, [...] "I have {{discovered}} that if you worry Fortune too much she resents it, and flies away from you. It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> {{is something to be}} said for the quietly expectant attitude. After all, one is now and then given much more than one could by any effort possibly deserve." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{would you}} have me say?" [...] she asked, her eyes upon the floor. [...] "Was I too forward? It <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>there</b> could not be {{question}} {{of such a thing}} between us now. I belong to you. What man has ever served a woman as you have served me? What better friend, what nobler lover did ever woman have? Why then need I take shame at confessing my devotion?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Brinkley was {{certainly}} amused at this. [...] "It <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that <b>there</b> you've been anticipated by nature--not to mention art." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{returned}} my glance, and it <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> <b>me</b> that <b>there</b> {{was some}} hidden meaning {{in his eyes}} which I failed to catch.|$|R
