2500|$|One of {{the largest}} {{problems}} faced by foreign traders in Guangzhou was finding a reliable medium of exchange that would enable <b>sustainable</b> <b>trade</b> with the Chinese. [...] The Chinese were always willing to accept bullion, in exchange for tea and other products. [...] This was because the Chinese were fairly self-sufficient {{and did not have}} a large desire for foreign goods. [...] Spices were very expensive and difficult to acquire considering that the supply coming from South America fluctuated and it required a great deal of goods to attain through a trade. [...] The British could not afford to sustain high-level trading in specie, and they were eventually forced to turn to opium from India. [...] Beginning in 1767 and rapidly expanding through the early 1800s, opium was illegally traded for specie with the Chinese and then reinvested in tea for importation to Great Britain.|$|E
