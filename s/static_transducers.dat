40|$|Abstract- Two of {{the most}} {{important}} <b>static</b> <b>transducer</b> characteristics, in any measurement system, are linearity and accuracy. In the present paper, the calibration and linearization of a low-cost orifice flow meter is considered. Accuracy improvement is based on calibration coefficients that are evaluated with the measurements obtained from a reference flow meter. Linearity improvement is based on a non-linear A/D conversion whose transfer characteristic is the inverse of the transducer’s characteristic. The linearity can be strongly improved using a non-linear A/D conversion performed by a low-cost ADC, using only single-bit input and output ports. The proposed method, already described by the authors in previous papers, is applied to an orifice-based flow meter, simplifying the typical conditioning circuit that requires an additional square root extractor circuit. The paper includes simulation and experimental results that validate theoretical expectations. I...|$|R
40|$|AbstractContrast {{detection}} thresholds {{are known}} to increase with background contrast, a phenomenon called contrast masking. We found that, under some conditions, observers improved their masked detection performance by repetitive practice of a masking experiment. This learning effect resulted in a cancellation of suprathreshold contrast masking within the contrast range measured. A two-alternative forced-choice discrimination paradigm was used, with stimuli consisting of Gabor signals as maskers and target, presented at the same location and time. Untrained observers showed increased detection thresholds with increasing mask contrast for suprathreshold mask contrasts, but perceptual learning caused an elimination of this classical effect, with masked thresholds reaching the no-mask level and below. Learning did not decrease, but rather somewhat increased, discrimination thresholds when target and mask shared the same Gabor signal parameters. Performance improvement {{was found to be}} specific for orientation and mask configurations, though it did transfer between mirror symmetric mask configurations and between eyes. These results argue against a <b>static</b> <b>transducer</b> function-based account for contrast masking and are consistent with a theory assuming multiple feature-based interactive network capable of long-term gain modifications...|$|R

The interference of blade motion with the pressure signal in the steep gradient portion of the blade passage is demonstrated, using optimal displacement spectra.

50|$|A taut wire {{perimeter}} security system is basically an independent screen of tensioned tripwires usually {{mounted on a}} fence or wall. Alternatively, the screen can be made so thick {{that there is no}} need for a supporting chainwire fence. These systems are designed to detect any physical attempt to penetrate the barrier. Taut wire systems can operate with a variety of switches or detectors that sense movement at each end of the tense wires. These switches or detectors can be a simple mechanical contact, <b>static</b> force <b>transducer</b> or an electronic strain gauge. Unwanted alarms caused by birds and other animals can be avoided by adjusting the sensors to ignore objects that exert small amounts of pressure on the wires. This type of system is vulnerable to intruders digging under the fence. A concrete footing directly below the fence is installed to prevent this type of attack.|$|R
40|$|Blurred edges appear sharper {{in motion}} {{than when they}} are stationary. We have {{previously}} shown how such distortions in perceived edge blur {{may be explained by}} a model which assumes that luminance contrast is encoded by a local contrast transducer whose response becomes progressively more compressive as speed increases. To test this model further, we measured the sharpening of drifting, periodic patterns over a large range of contrasts, blur widths, and speeds Human Vision. The results indicate that, while sharpening increased with speed, it was practically invariant with contrast. This contrast invariance cannot be explained by a fixed compressive nonlinearity since that predicts almost no sharpening at low contrasts. We show by computational modelling of spatiotemporal responses that, if a dynamic contrast gain control precedes the <b>static</b> nonlinear <b>transducer,</b> then motion sharpening, its speed dependence, and its invariance with contrast can be predicted with reasonable accuracy...|$|R

40|$|The Flight Research Laboratory (FRL), of the National Research Council of Canada {{owns and}} {{operates}} a Bell 412 research helicopter that {{is essentially the same}} type aircraft as the Canadian Department of National Defense (DND) Griffon. DND has a major research thrust involving the improvement of aerodynamic and simulation models of this aircraft. In collaboration with DND, FRL has recently performed flight testing of the Bell 412 in support of this effort. In addition to the already extensive suite of inertial and engine data collected on a regular basis, the aircraft was instrumented with 256 <b>static</b> pressure <b>transducers</b> located at various positions around the fuselage, engine cowls and tail boom. Rotor flapping, lead-lag and strain quantities were also instrumented. Data was acquired in many different flight re- gimes throughout the aircraft envelope, including hover, cruise flight, climbs and descents and autorotation. Data was also collected in the hover both in front of a hangar face and in a field clear of obstacles in two different wind conditions, with a set of ground based anemometers to collect air wake data. This extensive data set is intended to serve as validation data for compu- tational fluid dynamics (CFD) models of the aircraft and to extend the knowledge base of the characteristics of airflow around a helicopter in flight. The data will also allow a better under- standing of the effects of buildings on the air wake of a helicopter, an important consideration for ship dynamic interface.

40|$|Comparisons between {{scramjet}} combustor {{data and}} a three-dimensional full Navier-Stokes calculation {{have been made}} to verify and substantiate computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes and application procedures. High Mach number scramjet combustor development will rely heavily on CFD applications to provide wind tunnel-equivalent data of quality sufficient to design, build and fly hypersonic aircraft. Therefore. detailed comparisons between CFD results and test data are imperative. An experimental case is presented, for which combustor wall static pressures were measured and flow-fieid interferograms were obtained. A computer model was done of the experiment, and counterpart parameters are compared with experiment. The experiment involved a subscale combustor designed and fabricated for the National Aero-Space Plane Program, and tested in the Calspan Corporation 96 " hypersonic shock tunnel. The combustor inlet ramp was inclined at a 20 angle to the shock tunnel nozzle axis, and resulting combustor entrance flow conditions simulated freestream M= 10. The combustor body and cowl walls were instrumented with <b>static</b> pressure <b>transducers,</b> and the combustor lateral walls contained windows through which flowfield holographic interferograms were obtained. The CFD calculation involved a three-dimensional time-averaged full Navier-Stokes code applied to the axial flow segment containing fuel injection and combustion. The full Navier-Stokes approach allowed for mixed supersonic and subsonic flow, downstream-upstream communication in subsonic flow regions, and effects of adverse pressure gradients. The code included hydrogen-air chemistry in the combustor segment which begins near fuel injection and continues through combustor exhaust. Combustor ramp and inlet segments on the combustor lateral centerline were modelled as two dimensional. Comparisons to be shown include calculated versus measured wall static pressures as functions of axial flow coordinate, and calculated path-averaged density contours versus an holographic Interferogram...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{successful}} CFD {{models of}} cryocooler systems {{have shown that}} such models can pro-vide very useful performance predictions for cryocoolers. For miniature cryocoolers, CFD model-ing is likely the best technique available as models developed for larger systems may not accurately represent phenomena which become important as the device scale is reduced. Accurate CFD mod-eling of Stirling and pulse tube refrigerators requires realistic closure relations, {{particularly with respect to}} the hydrodynamic and thermal transport processes for the porous media which make up their heat exchangers and regenerators. Generally, these porous media are morphologically aniso-tropic, and thus the parameters which characterize them are anisotropic as well. Measurement of the hydrodynamic parameters in at least two dimensions is therefore preferred. Miniature regenerative cryocoolers will require porous regenerator and heat exchanger fillers with considerably smaller characteristic pore sizes than those commonly used in larger scale de-vices. This paper describes measurements of the hydrodynamic parameters of stacked discs of 635 mesh stainless steel and 325 mesh phosphor bronze using a CFD-assisted methodology. These materials are among the finest commercially available structures and can be suitable for use as miniature regenerator and heat exchanger fillers. Measurements were made in the axial and radial directions for both steady and oscillatory flow. Higher frequency operation is preferred for minia-ture cryocoolers; therefore a frequency range between 50 and 200 Hz was investigated for the oscillatory flow cases. The test setups for steady flow incorporated <b>static</b> pressure <b>transducers</b> and a mass flow rate meter; for oscillatory flow, the apparatus included dynamic pressure transducers and hot wire probes for CFD model verification. These test setups were each modeled using the Fluent CFD code. The directional Darcy permeability and Forchheimer’s inertial coefficients were obtained based on iterative comparisons between experimental measurements and CFD simulation results...|$|R

Optimizing energy expenditure or environmental control is not possible with conventional controls. Improper adjustment of thermostats can result in ventilation rates above the minimum while the supplemental heater is operating. Thermostats can provide undesirable environmental fluctuations. Variable-speed fan controls have difficulties with accuracy and reliability. Operators avoid the use of complex control systems because of their inability to set the controls properly;A single-board microcomputer was selected to provide logical control of the livestock environment. Inside and outside dry-bulb temperature inputs utilize a semiconductor sensor whose current output varies with absolute dry-bulb temperature. A dew-point temperature sensor measures the moisture content of the environment. The <b>static</b> pressure <b>transducers</b> include diaphragms and linear Hall effect sensors. Fan speeds are counted with pulses from digital Hall effect sensors. Operator inputs, the desired dry-bulb temperatures, are attained with the adjustment of the potentiometers. An 8 -bit analog-to-digital converter is interfaced to the microcomputer;Solid state relays control the power to single-speed fans, supplemental heater solenoids, and air inlet motors for air distribution. Eight-bit digital-to-analog converters provide signals to prototype speed controllers which manipulate variable-speed fans. The direction of the air inlet motors is controlled by electromagnetic relays. The operator adjusts the minimum ventilation rate of the variable-speed fans;Software, located in erasable programmable read-only-memory, presents a rational correlation between the ventilation, supplemental heating, and air distribution systems. The ventilation and supplemental heating systems attempt to provide the desired temperatures. The degree of change in ventilation rates is determined by the outside temperature. Variable-speed and single-speed fans function logically together to reduce abrupt fluctuations in airflow. The dew-point temperature is monitored to limit the relative humidity. The micrcomputer utilizes the fan rpm sensors to prevent winds from stalling variable-speed fans. Static pressure is regulated by the air inlets to maintain uniform air distribution. Fans, for summer ventilation, are utilized only during stressful weather conditions, thus conserving electrical energy. The software is written in mnemonic code and converted to machine language with an assembler;The controller, installed in a swine farrowing and nursery room, is operational and entering the system testing phase.

40|$|Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) has {{demonstrated}} two measurement devices for sensing and resolving the hydrodynamic loads on fluid machinery. The first - a derivative {{of the six}} component wind tunnel balance - senses the forces and moments on the rotating device through a weakened shaft section instrumented {{with a series of}} strain gauges. This "rotating balance" was designed to directly measure the steady and unsteady hydrodynamic loads on an inducer, thereby defining both the amplitude and frequency content associated with operating in various cavitation modes. The second device - a high frequency response pressure transducer surface mounted on a rotating component - was merely an extension of existing technology for application in water. MSFC has recently completed experimental evaluations of both the rotating balance and surface-mount transducers in a water test loop. The measurement bandwidth of the rotating balance was severely limited by the relative flexibility of the device itself, resulting in an unexpectedly low structural bending mode and invalidating the higher frequency response data. Despite these limitations, measurements confirmed that the integrated loads on the four-bladed inducer respond to both cavitation intensity and cavitation phenomena. Likewise, the surface-mount pressure transducers were subjected to a range of temperatures and flow conditions in a non-rotating environment to record bias shifts and transfer functions between the transducers and a reference device.

It has been proved that by using multiple numbers of piezo ceramic elements, development of required size of wave measurement device (i. e. disk transducer) is possible. To clarify the workability of such disk transducer, elastic properties of Toyoura sand (D 50 = 0. 20 mm) were evaluated by three sorts of method (i. e. <b>static</b> method, disk <b>transducer</b> method and Trigger accelerometer method) by using the large triaxial apparatus with the rectangular prismatic specimen of 50 cm* 23 cm* 23 cm. All tested sample were in completely dry condition.

Both the axial and radial strain was locally measured by local deformation transducers. Newly developed large size disk transducer has been used to evaluate the elastic properties by wave measurement method. Trigger Accelerometer method was also used to compare the elastic wave properties obtained by elastic wave propagation method.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} that physical activity is beneficial for the elder person {{to reduce the}} risk of coronary heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, stroke, anxiety and depression but many forms of exercise are unsuitable for the elderly or they quit after a short period of time through lack of motivation or desire to attend a gym (American College of Sports Medicine, 2004; Hui and Rubenstein, 2006; Lee et al, 1991). However, gardening is an activity which many elderly people enjoy (Yusuf et al, 1996), rather than doing it for therapeutic reasons. The potential benefits of gardening as a form of age-appropriate exercise has particular emphasis on maintaining strength and flexibility to avoid fractures resulting from falls or osteoporosis. The gardening activities considered included digging, weeding, pruning, wheelbarrow operation, lifting of heavy objects, lawn mowing and raking. This project has measured the movement and loads placed on gardeners during a range of gardening activities and calculated the consequential forces occurring within the muscles, tendons, joints and bones of the gardener. The motion of gardeners was measured using a 12 camera 3 -dimensional optical tracking system. The forces acting between the gardening equipment and the gardener was measured using force <b>transducers,</b> <b>static</b> weight plus inertia forces. The loads generated within the gardener were calculated using the Biomechanics of Bodies (BoB) software (Shippen & May 2010). The musculoskeletal model within BoB consists of 36 rigid segments connected with 33 joints whose actions represent their anatomical counterparts and 606 locomotor muscle units. The torques occurring at the joints were calculated using a Lagrangian inverse dynamics method. The force distribution within the muscles were calculated by minimising an objective function defined as the sum of the squares of the muscle activations constrained by the muscle torque equalling the inverse dynamics torque. This study suggests techniques and tool design to minimise the injury risk for the gardener...|$|R
40|$|Bedside {{safety rails}} are used {{extensively}} throughout hospitals and residential care environments {{as a safety}} device to protect people against the risk of falling out of bed. However, several adverse incidents involving body entrapment {{have been linked to}} their use, which have resulted in serious injury to the bed occupants and, in more extreme cases, fatalities. Internationally agreed standards (i. e. European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) standards) for the design and testing of bed rails have recently been developed and are targeted at improved safety requirements (European Committee for Standardisation 1997, 2000). The {{purpose of the present study}} was to: 1) determine whether the CEN test procedure for assessing bed rail strength and rigidity requirements is consistent with human force exertions to which bed rails may be exposed; 2) carry out loading tests on bed rails currently in use throughout the UK to determine whether they comply with the current safety recommendations proposed by the CEN standards. A laboratory study was conducted to determine the force exertions of 20 participants performing seven tasks (including activities of both bed occupants and care providers), which were considered representative of the forces to which bed rails could be exposed during normal use. Forces exerted by participants were measured using a force platform and distortions of the bed rails leading to potential entrapment zones were measured using linear displacement <b>transducers.</b> <b>Static</b> load tests were then conducted, in which incremental point loading was applied at the most adverse points on each of nine different bed rails (commonly used in UK nursing and residential care homes) in accordance with the test procedure detailed in the current CEN standards. Maximum static forces exerted by participants were found to range between 250 N and 350 N, which were within the 500 N force tolerance requirements set by the standards. Dynamic tasks involving ‘rolling aggressively’ against the bed rail produced the highest peak force of 722 N. None of the bed rails included in this study met the requirements of the CEN test procedures, principally due to horizontal lateral displacements being in excess of 50 mm for a 500 N applied force and/or the bed rails' inability to withstand inward horizontal forces of 500 N. Bed rails used with divan beds were often unable to withstand forces greater than 300 N due to turning moments exceeding the bed rail's restraining mechanism. Current CEN standards for assessing the strength and rigidity of bedside safety rails appear to be consistent with the human forces that might arise as a consequence of the normal movement and activities of a bed occupant or care provider. Although compliance with existing standards is not compulsory, findings from the tests carried out on the selection of bed rails in current use throughout the UK highlight the need for improvements in the design and manufacture of bed rails...|$|R
40|$|Power {{companies}} {{are on a}} daily basis making operational strategies to operate power plants in an efficient and good way. To do this must all impacts and challenges with influence be comprised in the analytical work. In a hydropower plant, one of these challenges is related to the estimation of friction impact from dynamics generated after regulating the water flow in the conduit. Usually are power plants constructed to operate at specific flow conditions, such operation condition may nowadays be difficult to maintain or not desirable as price and demand in the power network are always changing. To operate with economic advantage, is it thus important to find the optimal production that corresponds to the optimal combination of price and demand. Hence, the plants has to be regulated. Similar experience occur at some large hydropower plants as they have the responsibility for maintaining the stability of the network frequency by balancing the power production against consumption. Regulation introduce as mention the system to harmonic oscillatory flow, which further presents the challenge of friction modeling. The frictional effect may be difficult to foresee, as the knowledge on the frictional response is undesirably low. Economic losses and expected production are thus hard to estimate. It is thus of interest to purpose a model that can estimate the losses in a manageable way, not requiring too much computational power. In hydropower plants are one of the generated dynamics called mass oscillations, where the water mass is oscillating between two free surfaces, the surface of the upper reservoir and the surge shaft. There are today few simple models suited to predicting these oscillations. The existing models require a lot of computational power, making them unfit for power companies to use in their daily work. This challenge {{is one of the main}} motivation for this thesis, and will thus be the subject of interest to investigate closer. In the early phase of this thesis was a paper written on the work presented in a project work made by the author in the autumn of 2016 [1], and additionally the planed work of this thesis. The paper was presented at the 7 th International symposium on Current Research in Hydraulic Turbines (CRHT-VII) at Kathmandu University in April 2017 and is attached in Appendix H. The thesis starts with presenting fundamental theory and existing literature on the subject of conduit flow, friction modeling and flow dynamics in hydropower plants. Further, is the experimental test described with laboratory facilities and supported preliminary work. The thesis provides with knowledge and experience on frictional losses through five test cases, which is tested in the established dynamic test rig. The test results are compared against simulations. Four transient friction models are tested, the Quasi-steady model, the model by Ogawa et al., the model by Vitkovsky and the idea of the one-term friction model. The simulation approach for all models is described in detail before results are presented and further discussed. In the preliminary work was a dynamic test rig for measurements on harmonic oscillatory flow designed, where necessary instruments, sensors and components are installed. Four <b>static</b> pressure <b>transducers</b> and one electromagnetic flowmeter respectively measure pressure and flow rate. One of the pressure probes was located in the surge shaft to measure the water fluctuation. Five meters downstream the upper tank is the EMF located, giving the flow rate and mean velocity. All sensors installed are located at preferred locations, satisfying fully developed flow. Additionally, a test section is established, facilitated for water flow visualization with particle image velocimetry. The dynamic test rig performed well, running with both the traditional surge shaft and the siphon system. Test results from laboratory measurement showed good correspondence on dynamic transient theory and how the dynamics are expected to propagate. Unsteady flow conditions introduced the fluid to additional friction, where acceleration, deceleration and zero average velocity was present. Simulation results from different models showed large variety in performance. The change in velocity seems to be the main parameter affecting the performance of the diverse modeling results. Performance showed strong relation to how each model was implementing the velocity. Flow acceleration and zero average velocity in the turnings of the oscillations seems to be the main challenges of friction modeling. The new "one-term" model shows a positive trend by providing extra friction in relation to the original Darcy-Weisbach equation under acceleration and deceleration, which correspond to measurement results. The thesis will describe the challenges closer and evaluate the models in more detail, and thus positively contribute to increasing the knowledge on the subject...|$|R
