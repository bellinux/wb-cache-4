40|$|Abstract: The {{aerodynamics}} of transonic fans {{is discussed}} {{with emphasis on}} the use of three-dimensional design techniques, such as blade sweep and lean, to improve their performance. In order to study the interaction of these 3 D features with the <b>shock</b> <b>pattern</b> a series of five different designs is produced and analysed by CFD. It is found that the 3 D features have remarkably little effect on the <b>shock</b> <b>pattern</b> near the tip where the shock must remain perpendicular to the casing. Lower down the blade significant shock sweep, and hence reduced shock loss, can be induced by 3 D design but this is usually at the expense of reduced stall margin and increased loss elsewhere along the blade span. Overall, very little change in efficiency is produced by blade sweep or lean. However, forwards lean of the rotor does produce a small increase in mass flow. Radial migration of the boundary fluid on the suction surface behind the shock is shown to play a large part in the aerodynamics near the blade tip...|$|E

40|$|At the {{trailing}} edge of supersonic high-pressure turbine vanes, a typical <b>shock</b> <b>pattern,</b> the so-called fish-tail shocks, originates {{due to the}} flow rotation imposed by its finite thickness. In addition, shock and shock/fan systems can arise in case of a post-expanded channel design or at off-design conditions. ORC turbine stator blades are particularly prone to this phenomena since they are designed to provide a high outlet Mach number, especially at the first stage. In the close proximity of the saturation curve, near the critical point, molecularly complex organic fluids for ORC applications may exhibit a number of non-ideal gasdynamic effects, including a remarkable dependency of the shock properties on the upstream thermodynamic state of the fluid, at a fixed upstream Mach number. The influence of thermodynamic conditions on the <b>shock</b> <b>pattern</b> is assessed {{as a function of the}} flow deviation and compared against the ideal gas case, for which the shock properties depends on the upstream Mach number only.

40|$|The {{recognition}} of objects from their projected two-dimensional shapes is a challenging problem {{owing to the}} spectrum of possible variations reflected in the image domain, e. g., those caused by movement of parts, changes in viewing geometry, occlusion, etc. This motivates a need for quantitative as well as qualitative descriptions of shape in terms of structural relations between components; the latter remain largely invariant under the above changes. In this paper we confront the theoretical and practical difficulties of computing such a representation, based on the detection of shocks or singularities that arise as a shape is deformed, as organized in two stages. First, we develop subpixel local detectors {{for the detection of}} shocks and a classification of them into four types. Second, we show that <b>shock</b> <b>patterns</b> are not arbitrary, but obey the rules of a grammar which limits the possible shock combinations. In addition, <b>shock</b> <b>patterns</b> satisfy specific topological and geometric constraints. We develop this shock grammar and exploit the topological and geometric constraints to enforce global consistency: shock hypotheses that violate the grammar or are topologically or geometrically invalid are pruned, and survivors are organized into higher level structures. The result is a computational method for the detection, classification, and grouping of shocks. This leads to a description of shape as a hierarchical graph of shock groups. The graph is computed in the reaction-diffusion space, where diffusion plays a role of regularization to determine the significance of each shock-group. The representation is stable with rotations, scale changes, occlusion, movement of parts, noise and other variations, even at very low resolutions.

40|$|The next {{generation}} of ultra high bypass ratio (UHBR) turbofan engines may have to face new acoustic challenges related to inflow distortions caused by the short nacelle geometry. During take-off and cut-back conditions the flow regime at the fan blades may reach supersonic conditions. Thus a <b>shock</b> <b>pattern</b> is developing on the rotor blades and propagates upstream through the engine inlet and interacts with the mean inflow distortion. This paper presents numerical investigations performed with the DLR's computational Fluid dynamics (CFD) solver TRACE using a simplified quasi- 3 D approach. First, {{the applicability of the}} approach for the considered problem is shown. Afterwards the influence of the inflow distortion on a <b>shock</b> <b>pattern,</b> as it would be created by ideally equal blades is investigated by a Harmonic Balance (HB) method computation in the frequency domain. Real fans often show small variabilities in stagger angles due to manufacturing process and a specific blade ordering may be chosen. A stagger blade variation following a double cosine is addressed to investigate the effect of this specific blade patterning. For equal blades rearrangement, the obtained results reveal the expected scattering into the two adjacent modes caused by the inflow distortion of azimuthal mode order m 0 = 1. In addition it is shown that the new modes are subject to further scattering. For non-identical staggered rotor blades it is shown, that the pressure variation associated to the double cosine structure clearly dominates the inlet region.
