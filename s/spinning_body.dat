The center {{occupies}} three levels of the building and includes spa-like locker rooms, various weight-training stations, 75 cardio machines and two dance studios, where more than 30 fitness classes—Zumba, <b>spinning,</b> <b>body</b> combat, Pilates, aerobics and yoga—take place weekly. Each of the cardio stations features a personal HDTV monitor with internet access that can sync up with a mobile device, and a wide selection trail workouts set in locations around the world.|$|E
25|$|A torque is not {{necessarily}} limited to rotation around a fixed axis, however. It may change the magnitude and/or direction of the angular momentum vector, depending on the angle between the velocity vector and the non-radial component of the force vector, as viewed in the pivot's frame of reference. A net torque on a <b>spinning</b> <b>body</b> therefore {{may result in a}} precession without necessarily causing a change in spin rate.|$|E
25|$|A gyrostat {{consists}} of a massive flywheel concealed in a solid casing. Its behaviour on a table, or with various modes of suspension or support, serves to illustrate the curious reversal of the ordinary laws of static equilibrium due to the gyrostatic behaviour of the interior invisible flywheel when rotated rapidly. The first gyrostat was designed by Lord Kelvin to illustrate the more complicated state of motion of a <b>spinning</b> <b>body</b> when free to wander about on a horizontal plane, like a top spun on the pavement, or a bicycle on the road. Kelvin also made use of gyrostats to develop mechanical theories of the elasticity of matter and of the ether; these theories are of purely historical interest today.|$|E

40|$|A {{covariant}} hamiltonian formalism for {{the dynamics}} of compact <b>spinning</b> <b>bodies</b> in curved space-time in the test-particle limit is described. The construction allows a large class of hamiltonians accounting for specific properties and interactions of <b>spinning</b> <b>bodies.</b> The dynamics for a minimal and a specific non-minimal hamiltonian is discussed. An independent derivation of the equations of motion from an appropriate energy-momentum tensor is provided. It is shown how to derive constants of motion, both background-independent and background-dependent ones. Comment: 8 pages including references.

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{alternative}} theory about space-time is given. First some preliminaries about 3 -dimensional {{time and the}} reasons for its introduction are presented. Alongside the 3 -dimensional space (S) the 3 -dimensional space of spatial rotations (SR) is considered independently from the 3 -dimensional space. Then it is given a model of the universe, based on the Lie groups of real and complex orthogonal 3 x 3 matrices in this 3 + 3 + 3 -dimensional space. Special attention is dedicated for introduction and study of the space SxSR, which appears to be isomorphic to SO(3,R) xSO(3,R) or S^ 3 xS^ 3. The influence of the gravitational acceleration to the <b>spinning</b> <b>bodies</b> is considered. Some important applications of these results about <b>spinning</b> <b>bodies</b> are given, which naturally lead to violation of Newton's third law in its classical formulation. The precession of the spinning axis is also considered. Comment: 35 page...|$|R

5000|$|From {{classical}} mechanics, if {{stars and}} planets {{are considered to be}} purely spherical masses, then they will obey a simple 1/r2 force law and hence execute closed elliptical orbits. Non-spherical mass effects are caused by the application of external potential(s): the centrifugal potential of <b>spinning</b> <b>bodies</b> causes rotational flattening and the tidal potential of a nearby mass raises tidal bulges. Rotational and tidal bulges create gravitational quadrupole fields (1/r3) that lead to orbital precession ...|$|R

50|$|When a <b>spinning</b> <b>body</b> {{passes through}} air {{at right angles}} to its axis of spin, it {{experiences}} a sideways force in the third dimension. This Magnus effect was first demonstrated on a spinning cylinder by Gustav Magnus in 1872. If the cylinder axis is aligned spanwise (side to side) then forward movement through the air generates lift. The rotating body {{does not need to be}} a cylinder and many related shapes have been studied.|$|E
50|$|Nodal {{precession}} is the precession of {{the orbital}} plane of a satellite around the rotation axis of an astronomical body such as Earth. This precession {{is due to}} the non-spherical nature of a <b>spinning</b> <b>body,</b> which creates a non-uniform gravitational field. The following discussion relates to low earth orbit of artificial satellites which have no describable effect on the motion of the Earth. The nodal precession of more massive, natural satellites such as the Moon is more complex.|$|E

50|$|A rotor/Flettner ship {{is a type}} of ship {{designed}} to use the Magnus effect for propulsion. The Magnus effect is a force acting on a <b>spinning</b> <b>body</b> in a moving airstream, which acts perpendicularly to the direction of the airstream.

The sails, or Flettner rotors, aid the ship's propulsion by means of the Magnus effect - the perpendicular force that is exerted on a <b>spinning</b> <b>body</b> moving through a fluid stream.|$|E
50|$|The Magnus {{effect is}} a force acting on a <b>spinning</b> <b>body</b> in a moving airstream, which {{produces}} a force perpendicular to {{the direction of the}} airstream. This is used in backspin to increase range in ball sports, and also the bouncing bombs developed by Barnes Wallis. Rotor ships take advantage of this same effect by spinning a large vertical cylinder, typically using an electric motor, and using the resulting force for propulsion. Due to the arrangement of forces, rotor ships are able to sail closer to the wind, which has a number of advantages.|$|E
