2500|$|As part {{of another}} longstanding <b>scientific</b> <b>dispute,</b> Hawking had emphatically argued, and bet, that the Higgs boson {{would never be}} found. The {{particle}} was proposed to exist {{as part of the}} Higgs field theory by Peter Higgs in 1964. Hawking and Higgs engaged in a heated and public debate over the matter in 2002 and again in 2008, with Higgs criticising Hawking's work and complaining that Hawking's [...] "celebrity status gives him instant credibility that others do not have." [...] The particle was discovered in July 2012 at CERN following construction of the Large Hadron Collider. Hawking quickly conceded that he had lost his bet and said that Higgs should win the Nobel Prize for Physics, which he did in 2013.|$|E
2500|$|Later, the {{original}} reply to Winterberg {{was removed from}} their website and replaced with a much shorter statement saying only that Winterberg's conclusions were incorrect, specifically that he had focused on the missing page fragment, [...] "a fact without any bearing on the matter at hand", while failing [...] "to address the substantive difference between the theory expounded in the proofs" [...] of Hilbert. The statement further said that Winterberg had apparently indicated that he was [...] "personally offended" [...] by {{the original}} response, the [...] "Max Planck Institute for the History of Science has decided to replace the original, more detailed response to his paper with this abbreviated version". This was, apparently, because the original reply had contained two very derisive statements against Professor Winterberg; later, the Max Planck Society released a note distancing itself from those two statements, without commenting on the underlying <b>scientific</b> <b>dispute.</b>|$|E

60|$|Our author's {{evidence}} for sign-boards is from an Ottawa Indian, and is published from his MS. by Mr. Hoskyns Abrahall. {73} The testimony {{is of the}} greatest merit, for {{it appears to have}} first seen the light in a Canadian paper of 1858. Now in 1858 totems were only spoken of in Lafitau, Long, and such old writers, and in Cooper's novels. They had not become subjects of <b>scientific</b> <b>dispute,</b> so the evidence is uncontaminated by theory. The Indians were, we learn, divided into [local?] tribes, and these 'into sections or families according to their ododams'--devices, signs, in modern usage 'coats of arms.' [Perhaps 'crests' would be a better word.] All people of one ododam (apparently under male kinship) lived together in a special section of each village. At the entrance to the enclosure was the figure of an animal, or some other sign, set up on the top of one of the posts. Thus everybody knew what family dwelt in what section of the village. Some of the families were called after their ododam. But the family with the bear ododam were called Big Feet, not Bears. Sometimes parts of different animals were 'quartered' [my suggestion], and one ododam was a small hawk and the fins of a sturgeon.|$|E

This paper advances the study of the Advocacy Coalition Framework (ACF) by examining the limited extent to which extensive scientific research over a 15 -year period changed the basic composition and argumentation of different advocacy coalitions in a highly adversarial setting. Based on coding of the media coverage over the period 1986 - 2013, this paper analyzes the composition of the advocacy coalitions, their stability over time, and the limited extent to which learning took place in response to <b>scientific</b> <b>disputes.</b> It also highlights how coalitions between actors with similar policy beliefs did not form, highlighting the importance of the ACF and other policy processes to consider dynamics that go beyond the individual subsystem under investigation...|$|R

The main objective in this study was to understand possible reasons for the scientific discussion associated with the question as to how fertilization for increased forest growth influences the forest ecosystem? Another objective was to clarify the divergent theoretical grounds within this scientific field.
