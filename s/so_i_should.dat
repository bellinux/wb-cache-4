2500|$|When Chen Biao's elder {{half-brother}} Chen Xiu died, Chen Biao's mother {{refused to}} submit to Chen Xiu's mother, who had a higher status in the family because she was Chen Wu's official spouse. Chen Biao told his mother, [...] "It's unfortunate that my brother died early. Now, I'm {{the head of the}} family <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> pay respect to my stepmother. Mother, I hope you can accept my stepmother and maintain harmonious relations with her. If you can't, I'll leave and stay elsewhere." [...] Chen Biao said so out of graciousness and filial piety. His mother agreed and got along well with his stepmother.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{spoke to}} Alex Ferguson and {{the deal was}} close to being done. I then went on holiday, and my agent at the time, Ambrose Mendy, said it wasn't worth me coming back to do a picture in a United shirt when the deal was completed, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> do one before I left, {{and it would be}} {{released}} when the deal was announced. Lawrence Luster of the Daily Star took the picture and put in the library. Soon after, their sister paper, the Daily Express, were looking for a picture of me playing for West Ham, and found the one of me in the United shirt in the pile. They published it and all hell broke loose. [...] "I came back from holiday to discover West Ham fans were going mad. It wasn't really my fault. I was only a kid, I did what my agent told me to do, then took all the crap for it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Li Dian {{had over}} 3,000 {{families}} in his clansmen and close followers, {{all of whom}} lived in Chengshi County (乘氏縣; east of present-day Heze, Shandong). He proposed to Cao Cao to have them relocated to Wei Commandery (魏郡; north of present-day Ci County, Hebei), Cao Cao's base of operations during his campaigns in northern China. Cao Cao laughed and asked Li Dian, [...] "You admire Geng Chun and wish to emulate him, don't you?" [...] Li Dian replied, [...] "I'm humble and timid and my contributions are lowly, but the rewards I've received are too high, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have my entire clan join me in service so that I'll feel more deserving of the rewards. Besides, the chaos haven't ended yet, so it's better to keep them close to better control the Empire. I'm not emulating Geng Chun." [...] Li Dian's clansmen and close followers were then relocated to Ye (鄴; in present-day Handan, Hebei). Cao Cao was pleased and he promoted Li Dian to General Who Destroys Barbarians (破虜將軍).|$|E

6000|$|... "Pardon! I {{simply said}} {{my name was}} Hoffman. You did not ask me point blank if I was the baron; had you done <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have confessed all, for {{it was very hard}} to {{restrain}} myself this morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'N-no, sir,' replied Wegg, coolly, 'I should hardly {{describe}} it <b>so,</b> sir. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> say, mellers it. Mellers it, {{is the word}} <b>I</b> <b>should</b> employ, Mr Boffin.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Once, when Jiang Qin was {{stationed}} in Xuancheng County (宣城縣) and was out fighting rebels in Yuzhang Commandery, Xu Sheng, {{who was then the}} Prefect (令) of Wuhu, arrested an officer under Jiang Qin and requested for permission from Sun Quan to have the officer executed. As Jiang Qin was away at that time, Sun Quan denied the request. Xu Sheng had since estranged himself from Jiang Qin. Later, during the Battle of Ruxu in 217, Jiang Qin and Lü Meng were put in charge of military discipline. Xu Sheng was constantly worried that Jiang Qin would find fault with him, but, much to his surprise, Jiang praised him instead, and Xu was very impressed by Jiang's virtuous behaviour. Jiang Qin became more highly regarded after this incident. Sun Quan later asked Jiang Qin, [...] "Xu Sheng offended you earlier on, but yet now you praise him. You wish to emulate Qi Xi, don't you?" [...] Jiang Qin replied, [...] "I heard that one should not let his personal feuds affect his official duties. Xu Sheng is loyal and hardworking, possesses both courage and talent, and is capable of leading thousands of troops. Now, we've yet to accomplish our great task, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> help to scout for and recommend talents to serve the state instead of letting my private problems cloud my judgment." [...] Sun Quan was very pleased.|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>should,</b> nephew, and <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>should,</b> if I had {{not been}} detained. Surely you do not suppose that I would linger in the accursed place? Bah," [...] and he spat upon the ground, [...] "it stinks of Englishmen. I cannot get the taste of them out of my mouth." ...|$|E

6000|$|IV:2:19 [...] SIDO. [...] You {{should know}} him well; [...] And if you deem it <b>so,</b> why <b>I</b> <b>should</b> deem [...] The {{inference}} just.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{and with}} a single red anemone in your hand, <b>so</b> that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> know you without being obliged to put on my spectacles." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I {{have such}} a dream,--such a castle-in-the-air! If I could think it might ever be <b>so,</b> then <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not want to die." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How {{can you say}} <b>so?</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{hear him}} if he were there,' said Baptista, {{sufficiently}} recovered to argue down an apparent untruth.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Even <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> thank her. Then {{would the}} bitterest pang be taken away. Those at our home would not deem us faithless recreants.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed, I hope <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{break my}} heart otherwise. But can you wonder that Papa should wish for some delay and some proof?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps <b>so.</b> But <b>I</b> <b>should</b> rather {{expect a}} college friend of Lord Worthington's to {{be a hard}} rider or drinker than a hard reader." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I did not intend, of course, {{to strike}} you <b>so</b> hard," [...] <b>I</b> said, [...] "and I am sorry <b>I</b> did <b>so,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>should</b> like to borrow some tea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, a {{position}} {{is more than}} <b>I</b> <b>should</b> presume to call it," [...] Morris Townsend answered. [...] "That sounds <b>so</b> fine. <b>I</b> <b>should</b> like some quiet work--something to turn an honest penny." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{very kind}} of you to say <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> like to ask one question, Miss Clibborn. Have you any {{objection}} to me personally?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And me, Pathfinder!" [...] impetuously {{interrupted}} Mabel; [...] "do {{you regret}} having known me? Could I think <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> never {{be at peace}} with myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, and he wouldn't {{be so much}} {{inclined}} to do <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> think," [...] thought Branwen, but she had the sense not to say so.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose it}} seems to you," [...] said the Doctor, laughing, [...] "that in <b>so</b> doing <b>I</b> <b>should</b> play your brother a very shabby trick." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ha! married, then! The cool hand! And verily, {{but that}} Cilly takes it <b>so</b> easily, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> imagine {{it was her}} singing prodigy--eh? It was, then?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall never}} marry," [...] said Ann Veronica, resolutely; [...] "I'm not the sort. That's why it's <b>so</b> {{important}} <b>I</b> <b>should</b> take my own line now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Cut away, sir!' cried Mark. 'Make it strong, sir. Let it be wery pinted, sir. Do I think <b>so?</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> think so. Go to work, sir!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hardly <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{not have}} liked your father {{to be so}} much devoted to his mother. Remember, jealousy is a smoke that cannot exist without some warmth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{certainly}} did not," [...] and Esmond flashed a keen glance at him. [...] "If I had done <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> naturally not have troubled you about him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We hope <b>so.</b> But <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{feel safer}} if Maud were engaged to Reggie. I do {{think you might}} take the trouble to speak to Maud." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "`In conclusion, {{allow me}} to congratulate you on this piece of good fortune--perhaps, knowing your {{character}} <b>so</b> well, <b>I</b> <b>should</b> have written, this good gift from God.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said, after a pause,--"not now. Were I to do <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be false. You bade me take my love elsewhere, and I did so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really, it did {{not occur}} to me to ask him," [...] I admitted. [...] "How curious you women are! No, I don't think <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> say not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{you never}} saw him looking as he looked this morning, Herbert. When I went in he was speechless, and he {{remained}} <b>so,</b> <b>I</b> <b>should</b> say, for some minutes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot say for certain, Featherstone, {{although}} <b>I</b> <b>should</b> {{think that}} she is, but she is <b>so</b> changed <b>I</b> <b>should</b> not have known her again in the least; besides, all her hair is cut close." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because <b>I</b> <b>should</b> be <b>so</b> happy; <b>I</b> <b>should</b> indeed. There's nothing <b>I</b> <b>should</b> like <b>so</b> {{much as to}} {{make myself}} useful in some way.
