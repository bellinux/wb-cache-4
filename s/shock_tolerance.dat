5000|$|The armor-piercing concept {{calls for}} more {{penetration}} capability than the target's armor thickness. Generally, the penetration capability of an armor-piercing round increases with the projectile's kinetic energy and also with concentration of that energy in a small area. Thus, an efficient means of achieving increased penetrating power is increased velocity for the projectile. However, projectile impact against armor at higher velocity causes greater levels of shock. Materials have characteristic maximum levels of shock capacity, beyond which they may shatter, or otherwise disintegrate. At relatively high impact velocities, steel {{is no longer an}} adequate material for armor-piercing rounds. Tungsten and tungsten alloys are suitable for use in even higher-velocity armor-piercing rounds, due to their very high <b>shock</b> <b>tolerance</b> and shatter resistance, and to their high melting and boiling temperatures. They also have very high density. Energy is concentrated by using a reduced-diameter tungsten shot, surrounded by a lightweight outer carrier, the sabot (a French word for a wooden shoe).

According to 2012 Food and Agricultural organization's report, India is the third largest producer of coconut and it dominates the production of arecanut worldwide. In this study, three Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) from coconut (CPCRI- 1), cocoa (CPCRI- 2) and arecanut (CPCRI- 3) characterized for the PGP activities have been sequenced. The draft genome sizes were 4. 7 Mb (56 % GC), 5. 9 Mb (63. 6 % GC) and 5. 1 Mb (54. 8 % GB) for CPCRI- 1, CPCRI- 2, CPCRI- 3, respectively. These genomes encoded 4056 (CPCRI- 1), 4637 (CPCRI- 2) and 4286 (CPCRI- 3) protein-coding genes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that both CPCRI- 1 and CPCRI- 3 belonged to Enterobacteriaceae family, while, CPCRI- 2 was a Pseudomonadaceae family member. Functional annotation of the genes predicted that all three bacteria encoded genes needed for mineral phosphate solubilization, siderophores, acetoin, butanediol, 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylate (ACC) deaminase, chitinase, phenazine, 4 -hydroxybenzoate, trehalose and quorum sensing molecules supportive of the plant growth promoting traits observed in the course of their isolation and characterization. Additionally, in all the three CPCRI PGPRs, we identified genes involved in synthesis of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), which recently has been proposed to aid plant growth.

This hyperthermia is too mild to induce any tissue injury, but it does result in pain due to burn-induced hyperalgesia/allodynia. This mild painful stimulus can result in the induction of descending anti-nociceptive mechanisms, especially in the adjacent burned area.

40|$|Abstract. Dielectric elastomers, or more {{precisely}} dielectric polymers, are a relatively new class of materials for variable-stiffness and variable-damping devices. Dielectric elastomers offer significant potential advantages compared with previous variable stiffness smart materials. Advantages include simplicity, broad dynamic range, ability to reach zero stiffness, low cost, minimal mass, <b>shock</b> <b>tolerance,</b> simple drive circuitry, and design flexibility. Dielectric elastomer devices in the variable-stiffness mode convert electrical and mechanical energy {{back and forth to}} change mechanical impedance. This type of electromechanical transduction distinguishes the variable stiffness mode from simply using a dielectric elastomer actuator to alter the geometry, and hence the stiffness, of the device. Stiffness using a variable-stiffness mode depends heavily on the electrical loading of the dielectric elastomer. Analysis shows that a constant voltage loading reduces stiffness, down to zero in some cases, while a constant charge loading increases stiffness. Many applications can be considered for dielectric elastomer variable-stiffness mode such as vibration control, suspensions, and tuning consumer devices for user comfort or preference. As with dielectric elastomer actuators and generators, silicones and acrylics are the most promising materials for variable-stiffness-mode devices...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} cells to survive {{freezing}} and thawing {{is expected to}} depend on the physiological conditions experienced prior to freezing. We examined factors affecting yeast cell survival during freeze-thaw stress, including those associated with growth phase, requirement for mitochondrial functions, and prior stress treatment(s), and the role played by relevant signal transduction pathways. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was frozen at - 20 degrees C for 2 h (cooling rate, less than 4 degrees C min- 1) and thawed on ice for 40 min. Supercooling occurred without reducing cell survival and was followed by freezing. Loss of viability was proportional to the freezing duration, indicating that freezing is the main determinant of freeze-thaw damage. Regardless of the carbon source used, the wild-type strain and an isogenic petite mutant ([rho 0]) showed the same pattern of freeze-thaw tolerance throughout growth, i. e., high resistance during lag phase and low resistance during log phase, indicating that the response to freeze-thaw stress is growth phase specific and not controlled by glucose repression. In addition, respiratory ability and functional mitochondria are necessary to confer full resistance to freeze-thaw stress. Both nitrogen and carbon source starvation led to freeze-thaw tolerance. The use of strains affected in the RAS-cyclic AMP (RAS-cAMP) pathway or supplementation of an rca 1 mutant (defective in the cAMP phosphodiesterase gene) with cAMP showed that the freeze-thaw response of yeast is {{under the control of the}} RAS-cAMP pathway.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: The {{success of}} social insects {{can be in}} part {{attributed}} to their division of labor, which has been explained by a response threshold model. This model posits that individuals differ in their response thresholds to task-associated stimuli, so that individuals with lower thresholds specialize in this task. This model {{is at odds with}} findings on honeybee behavior as nectar and pollen foragers exhibit different responsiveness to sucrose, with nectar foragers having higher response thresholds to sucrose concentration. Moreover, {{it has been suggested that}} sucrose responsiveness correlates with responsiveness to most if not all other stimuli. If this is the case, explaining task specialization and the origins of division of labor on the basis of differences in response thresholds is difficult. METHODOLOGY: To compare responsiveness to stimuli presenting clear-cut differences in hedonic value and behavioral contexts, we measured appetitive and aversive responsiveness in the same bees in the laboratory. We quantified proboscis extension responses to increasing sucrose concentrations and sting extension responses to electric shocks of increasing voltage. We analyzed the relationship between aversive responsiveness and aversive olfactory conditioning of the sting extension reflex, and determined how this relationship relates to division of labor. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sucrose and shock responsiveness measured in the same bees did not correlate, thus suggesting that they correspond to independent behavioral syndromes, a foraging and a defensive one. Bees which were more responsive to shock learned and memorized better aversive associations. Finally, guards were less responsive than nectar foragers to electric <b>shocks,</b> exhibiting higher <b>tolerance</b> to low voltage shocks. Consequently, foragers, which are more sensitive, were the ones learning and memorizing better in aversive conditioning. CONCLUSIONS: Our results constitute the first integrative study on how aversive responsiveness affects learning, memory and social organization in honeybees. We suggest that parallel behavioral modules (e. g. appetitive, aversive) coexist within each individual bee and determine its tendency to adopt a given task. This conclusion, which is at odds with a simple threshold model, should open new opportunities for exploring the division of labor in social insects...|$|R
40|$|Reduced Pain Plateau Waveform. Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the possible pain {{reduction of the}} plateau waveform in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients. Background: Previous {{studies have indicated that}} reduced amplitude waveforms would be less painful than a conventional (65 / 65 % tilt) biphasic waveform. Computer modeling suggested that a moderately long (10 - 12 msec) plateau (flat topped) shock waveform would deliver equivalent effectiveness with the lowest possible peak amplitude. Methods: We enrolled 27 patients at two sites with persistent AF with a total of 220 shocks delivered during internal atrial cardioversion using an interleaved crossover design. Patient response was scored in three ways: (1) a verbally reported discomfort score, (2) visual analog scale (VAS), and (3) a blinded observer reporting a contraction score. Results: All scores were significantly reduced (P < 0. 0001) by the plateau waveform with impressive statistics: Verbal discomfort (3. 51 ± 0. 13 to 2. 89 ± 0. 12), VAS (7. 00 ± 0. 56 to 5. 91 ± 0. 36), and contraction scores (1. 94 ± 0. 12 to 1. 62 ± 0. 12). The average pain threshold shift (TS) for the Verbal score was 2. 34, while that for the VAS score was 2. 30. (This means that the patient typically could tolerate 2. 34 times as much energy with the plateau waveform for the same level of verbally reported discomfort.) The contraction TS was less at 1. 57. Response scores were also corrected for the shock sequence number to control for the sensitization effect from multiple shocks. This increased the TS for the Verbal score to 3. 58, but the shock number was not significant for the VAS. A pulmonary artery electrode return was associated with lower pain compared with a coronary sinus position. Conclusion: A plateau shaped biphasic waveform resulted in significantly increased <b>shock</b> energy pain <b>tolerances.</b> Controlling for session sensitization, patients tolerated over three times as much energy for the same verbally reported discomfort scor...|$|R
