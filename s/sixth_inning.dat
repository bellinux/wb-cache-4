Tampa Bay cut the lead in half in the fourth inning; Carlos Peña doubled and was batted in on Evan Longoria's single, both players' first hits of the Series. The Rays then tied the game in the <b>sixth</b> <b>inning</b> when B. J. Upton scored from second base on a Peña single. The game was suspended after the top of the <b>sixth</b> <b>inning</b> due to rain, making it the first game in World Series history to not be played through to completion or declared a tie.|$|E
5|$|Steve Woodard {{received}} an unusual no-decision in 2000, when the team's Opening Day {{game against the}} Cincinnati Reds was called in the <b>sixth</b> <b>inning</b> due to rain, with the score tied at 3. This was the first Opening Day tie game since 1965.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his MLB debut, the league {{investigated}} Nova and fellow Yankees pitching prospect Wilkins de la Rosa for injecting each other with Vitamin B12. Overall, Nova made seven starts for the Yankees in 2010, pitching to a 1–2 record and a 4.50 ERA. Nova reached the <b>sixth</b> <b>inning</b> only once, however, as he allowed a higher opponents' batting average and ERA in the fifth inning than in the first four. The Yankees did not include Nova on their postseason roster.|$|E

5|$|The Dodgers scored {{their only}} {{run in the}} bottom of the fourth as Dusty Baker singled, {{advanced}} to second on an error, and scored on another single. They threatened again in the <b>sixth</b> <b>inning,</b> loading the bases, though they failed to score. That was the only inning after the fourth in which a Dodgers' runner reached scoring position. Niekro steadied again after the sixth, allowing just one baserunner on a two-out ninth-inning single over the remaining three innings.|$|E
5|$|The rest of {{the fifth}} inning saw no more hits, and after a Keltner double, three Indians {{were out in the}} top of the <b>sixth</b> <b>inning.</b> The Red Sox began to fight back in the bottom of the <b>sixth</b> <b>inning.</b> After getting Pesky out, Ted Williams reached first base on an error by Gordon. Stephens struck out, and with two outs in the inning, Bobby Doerr hit his 27th home run of the season to make the score 6–3. No runs were scored in the seventh inning, though Bearden and Mitchell both reached base. The Indians were able to score another run in the eighth inning after Jim Hegan was {{intentionally}} walked. Bearden then hit a fly ball to Williams, who dropped it, allowing Hegan to score and making it 7–3 in the Indians' favor. The Indians were able to score one more run in the ninth when Robinson scored after Keltner grounded into a bases-loaded double play. Bearden got the final three Red Sox out in the bottom of the ninth, finishing the game with an 8–3 Indians victory and giving Bearden a complete game.|$|E
5|$|Zobrist {{scored the}} Royals' first {{run in the}} first inning on a force play. In the bottom of the first inning, Wright hit a two-run home run that also scored Granderson. For the Royals, Alex Ríos drove Salvador Pérez home in the second inning, and scored on a passed ball by d'Arnaud, giving the Royals a 3–2 lead. After a Syndergaard single, Granderson hit a two-run home run just over the right field wall in the third inning, and the Mets took a 4–3 lead. The Mets added a run in the fourth inning on an RBI single by Conforto, and four more in the <b>sixth</b> <b>inning,</b> {{including}} an RBI single by Juan Uribe, in his first at bat since September 20. The Royals made a few uncharacteristic mistakes in this game, the first coming in the fourth inning when pitcher Yordano Ventura forgot to cover the base on a ground ball to the first baseman, and the second in the <b>sixth</b> <b>inning</b> when Royals pitcher Franklin Morales triple-clutched Granderson's ground ball, allowing all runners to be safe, which led to a 2-run single by Wright.|$|E

He pitched 98innings and yielded only 22 earned runs, {{which gave him}} an ERA of 2.02 during the approximately 50-day span. On August 26, Richard hit his first home run of the season during the second inning of the game. In his last {{game of the season}} on October 2, Richard pitched a complete game 13-strikeout performance, and he also hit a two-run home run in the <b>sixth</b> <b>inning.</b>|$|E
5|$|Granderson led off {{the first}} inning with a home run for the Mets, and scored the Mets' second run in the <b>sixth</b> <b>inning.</b> The Mets {{had a chance to}} break the game open in that <b>sixth</b> <b>inning</b> as they loaded the bases with no outs, but had to settle for one run after Céspedes lined a foul ball off his leg and was injured, leaving the game after popping up for the first out of the inning. Duda hit a {{sacrifice}} fly before d'Arnaud grounded out to end the inning. Harvey pitched eight shutout innings for the Mets, and convinced Collins to keep him in the game for the ninth. He then gave up a leadoff walk to Cain in the ninth inning, and the Royals got a run when Hosmer drove Cain in with a double, prompting Collins to call upon Familia to relieve Harvey. After a groundout by Moustakas advanced Hosmer to third base with one out, Pérez hit a ground ball to third baseman Wright, who after checking Hosmer at third, threw to first base for the second out; however, Hosmer broke for home as soon as the ball was thrown, and Duda, who fielded the out at first, threw wide at home attempting to throw Hosmer out, and the latter scored the tying run, resulting in Familia blowing his third save of the postseason and the series; his eight save opportunities tied the postseason record set in 2002 by Robb Nen.|$|E
5|$|His first no-hitter, on July 12, 1951, was a 1–0 {{defeat of}} his former team, the Indians. Gene Woodling's solo home run was the only run scored during the game. Reynolds retired the last 17 Indians he faced. Only four Indians reached base; he walked three and Bobby Ávila reached on an error by Phil Rizzuto. It was his third shutout of Cleveland that season. Bob Feller also threw a strong game and didn't allow a hit until the <b>sixth</b> <b>inning,</b> when Mickey Mantle doubled. Feller threw a {{complete}} game and allowed only four hits. Feller had thrown a no-hitter eleven days earlier.|$|E

5|$|In {{his last}} two seasons with Chicago, Pierce posted records of just 14–7 and 10–9, but a shaky bullpen contributed to his {{middling}} record; although he left {{the game with a}} lead in the <b>sixth</b> <b>inning</b> or later 15 times in those seasons, White Sox relievers failed to protect that lead seven times. Indeed, Pierce was seen to be the team's only consistently effective starter in 1960, picking up eight complete-game victories by mid-August. On June 20, 1961, Pierce broke Ed Walsh's White Sox record of 1,732 career strikeouts.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>sixth</b> <b>inning,</b> Howard's {{home run}} {{following}} a walk issued to Utley brought {{the game to}} 7–3. After Ibáñez hit a double into right field, Joba Chamberlain relieved Pettitte, allowing no further runs in the inning. In {{the top of the}} eighth inning, Dámaso Marte struck out Howard, which set a new World Series record for most strikeouts by a batter in a single series (13). After the strikeout, Marte was relieved by Rivera in a non-save situation, who allowed one hit and one walk before closing out the game and the Yankees' 27th championship.|$|E
5|$|On July 24, 2015, the Braves traded Uribe and Kelly Johnson to the New York Mets for John Gant and Rob Whalen. During {{his second}} game with New York, Uribe hit the walk-off {{single in the}} tenth inning {{to win the game}} for the Mets, 3–2 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Uribe missed the National League Division Series and National League Championship Series due to a chest {{contusion}} in September, but was added to the Mets' World Series roster and came off the bench in the <b>sixth</b> <b>inning</b> of Game 3 to deliver a pinch-hit single, driving in a run.|$|E

Rube Walker singled for the Dodgers, and Monte Irvin led off the bottom of the seventh with a double for the Giants. He reached third base after a bunt, and scored on a sacrifice fly by Thomson, tying the score at one run each.|$|E
5|$|Hamels was {{selected}} the Phillies starter for Game 1 of the World Series; the Phillies won 3–2, and Hamels earned his fourth win of the postseason. Hamels also started Game 5, which was suspended due to rain after {{the top of}} the <b>sixth</b> <b>inning</b> tied at 2-2, and receiving a no-decision; when Game 5 resumed the Phillies won 4-3 to clinch the World Series. Overall, Hamels made five postseason starts in 2008, going 4–0 with a 1.80 ERA. Hamels threw a total of 35 innings during the postseason, and held opponents scoreless in 28 of them; he never allowed more than one run in any of the seven innings in which he did not hold opponents scoreless.

5|$|Just as Herzog had {{predicted}} {{when he told}} Smith the Cardinals would win the pennant {{with him on the}} team, Smith found himself as the team's starting shortstop in the best-of-seven 1982 World Series against the Milwaukee Brewers. During the contest Smith scored three runs, had five hits, and did not commit an error in the field. When St. Louis was trailing 3–1 with one out in the <b>sixth</b> <b>inning</b> of Game 7, Smith started a rally with a base hit to left field, eventually scoring the first of the team's three runs that inning. The Cardinals scored two more runs in the 8th inning for a 6-3 win and the championship.|$|E
5|$|Kirby Higbe {{replaced}} Branca on the mound, {{and ended}} the inning with the Cardinals in the lead, 3–1. Both teams combined for one {{hit in the}} fourth inning, a single by Moore.
