5|$|After the March 1976 coup, Berni {{moved to}} New York City, where he {{continued}} painting, engraving, collaging and exhibiting. New York <b>struck</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> luxurious, consumerist, materially wealthy and spiritually poor. He conveyed these observations in subsequent {{work with a}} touch of social irony. His New York paintings display a great protagonism of color and include Aeropuerto (Airport), Los Hippies, Calles de Nueva York (Streets of New York), Almuerzo (Lunch), Chelsea Hotel and Promesa de castidad (Promise of Chastity). He also produced several decorative panels, scenographic sketches, illustrations, and collaborations for books.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Father John T. Pawlikowski from Chicago, {{referring}} {{to work by}} other historians, speculated that claims {{of hundreds of thousands}} of rescuers <b>struck</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> inflated. Likewise, Martin Gilbert has written that under Nazi regime, rescuers were an exception, albeit one that could be found in towns and villages throughout Poland.|$|E
25|$|In 1379 {{he became}} {{the owner of the}} castle Hrádek. In 1379 he succeeded to the archbishopric of his uncle Jan Očko z Vlašimi who had stepped down. Soon he became Chancellor to Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia. The next year the capital was struck by a Plaque epidemic, which <b>struck</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> well. He recovered, but this episode left deep scars on his {{character}} and he began to examine theological and philosophical problems at his castle Helfenburk u Úštěka.|$|E
50|$|Marrero {{took part}} in a four strike-out inning, which took place on July 18, 2017. Mike Bolsinger <b>struck</b> <b>him</b> out, <b>as</b> well as {{teammates}} Jackie Bradley Jr., Mitch Moreland, and Christian Vázquez.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, it's {{so sweet}} {{and clean and}} homelike," [...] said the girl quickly. At any other time he would have winced at the last adjective. It <b>struck</b> <b>him</b> now <b>as</b> exactly the word.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Travers {{became aware}} of the {{profound}} darkness of the cabin. Jorgenson heard her staggering in there. After a moment a woman's voice, which <b>struck</b> even <b>him</b> <b>as</b> strange, said in faint tones: ...|$|R
25|$|The {{humanitarian}} {{ideal of}} the new Masonic order <b>struck</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> absolutely compatible with the Socialist ideas of Louis Goaziou. Muzzarelli contacted Goaziou in 1903 {{with the idea of}} creating in Charleroi (Pennsylvania) either a Lodge under the Grand Orient. He did not inform Goaziou of the option to form the Lodge of under Le Droit Humain, into which their wives also could be admitted, until he arrived in Charleroi in October 1903 to institute the Lodge. The charter members decided they would found the Lodge under Le Droit Humain. The first three degrees were conferred on them by Antoine Muzarelli, and over two days, October 18 and 19, 1903, the first Co-masonic American lodge, Alpha No 301 was born in Charleroi, Pennsylvania. Louis Goaziou became the first Worshipful Master.|$|E
500|$|When CBS {{television}} {{interviewed him}} in 1967, Altgens {{said it was}} obvious to him that the head shot came from behind Kennedy's limousine [...] "because it caused him to bolt forward, dislodging him from this depression in the seat cushion". He added that the commotion across the street after the shooting <b>struck</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> odd, since he believed the assassin would have needed to move very quickly to get there.|$|E
500|$|Warner {{remained}} {{active as}} an independent producer until the early 1970s to run some of the company's distributions and exhibition division. [...] Among his last productions was a film adaptation of a Broadway musical, 1776, which was released through Columbia Pictures. [...] Before the film's release, Warner showed a preview cut to U.S. President Richard Nixon, who recommended substantial changes, including {{the removal of the}} song 'Cool, Cool, Considerate Men' that <b>struck</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> veiled criticisms of the ongoing Vietnam War. [...] Without consulting the film's director, Peter H. Hunt, Warner ordered the film re-edited. [...] The cuts have since been restored in most television showings and in the film's DVD release.|$|E
6000|$|She <b>struck</b> <b>him,</b> indeed, <b>as</b> really scared; {{it was as}} if her mask of smile {{had become}} awry, and failed to cover her emotion; and he was puzzled, thinking, 'I wouldn't have {{believed}} she had it in her....' [...] "It's not an easy business," [...] he said; [...] "I'll think it over." ...|$|R
60|$|The thought <b>struck</b> <b>him</b> just <b>as</b> a stout, kindly-looking seaman {{passed with}} a couple of shipmates. It was a good-natured face, and the figure was that of a man who lived well. A moment’s hesitation, and Master Jones, with a courage born of despair, ran after him and tugged him by the sleeve.|$|R
6000|$|Bartley {{started as}} if the other had <b>struck</b> <b>him,</b> and <b>as</b> he glared at Bird the anger {{went out of his}} face for pure amazement. [...] "Are you out of your mind, Henry?" [...] he asked calmly. [...] "Perhaps you're drunk too, this morning. The Devil seems to have got into pretty much everybody." ...|$|R
500|$|During {{the decade}} Shaw {{travelled}} widely and frequently. Most of his journeys were with Charlotte; she enjoyed voyages on ocean liners, {{and he found}} peace to write during the long spells at sea. Shaw met an enthusiastic welcome in South Africa in 1932, despite his strong remarks about the racial divisions of the country. In December 1932 the couple embarked on a round-the-world cruise. In March 1933 they arrived at San Francisco, to begin Shaw's {{first visit to the}} US. He had earlier refused to go to [...] "that awful country, that uncivilized place", [...] "unfit to govern itself... illiberal, superstitious, crude, violent, anarchic and arbitrary". He visited Hollywood, with which he was unimpressed, and New York, where he lectured to a capacity audience in the Metropolitan Opera House. Harried by the intrusive attentions of the press, Shaw was glad when his ship sailed from New York harbour. New Zealand, which he and Charlotte visited the following year, <b>struck</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> [...] "the best country I've been in"; he urged its people to be more confident and loosen their dependence on trade with Britain. He used the weeks at sea to complete two plays—The Simpleton of the Unexpected Isles and The Six of Calais—and begin work on a third, The Millionairess.|$|E
500|$|The {{next morning}} Sherlock realises [...] "hound" [...] {{may be an}} acronym rather than a word. The pair run into DI Lestrade (Rupert Graves) who was sent by Mycroft {{to keep an eye}} on Sherlock. They {{interrogate}} the innkeepers about a past order for meat that John has spotted, which <b>struck</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> odd for a vegetarian restaurant. The innkeepers kept a dog on the moor to boost the tourist trade, but assure the investigators they had put it down. This explanation satisfies Lestrade but not Sherlock, who insists the dog he saw was monstrous. Calling Mycroft, Sherlock gains access to Baskerville again. Searching the lower levels of the genetics labs, John finds himself trapped and then hears growling which he assumes is the hound. Locking himself in an empty cage, he calls Sherlock, who rescues him. Sherlock deduces a chemical weapon designed to trigger violent hallucinations was responsible. Retreating into his [...] "mind palace", a memory technique, Sherlock realises [...] "Liberty" [...] and [...] "In" [...] stands for Liberty, Indiana. After viewing confidential files, he sees [...] "H.O.U.N.D." [...] was a secret C.I.A. project aimed at creating a hallucinatory anti-personnel chemical weapon, but the project was abandoned several years before. Sherlock realises Frankland, who participated in the project, has continued it in secret.|$|E
500|$|Tom Cruise as Colonel Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg: The German army Colonel who was {{instrumental}} in the conspiracy to assassinate Adolf Hitler. Bryan Singer saw von Stauffenberg as [...] "very much a humanist", saying, [...] "He understood his role as a colonel, but he also understood that the Nazis were doing terrible, terrible, terrible things." [...] Having directed Superman Returns, Singer compared von Stauffenberg's dual identity as loyal colonel and conspirator to Superman and his civilian identity Clark Kent. Cruise had wanted to work with Singer since they met at the premiere for , and the actor was enticed by the script's background, the truth of which <b>struck</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> a surprise. The actor described von Stauffenberg's heroism, [...] "I thought of it in terms of what [...] Stauffenberg represents. He was someone who realized that he had to take the steps that ultimately cost him his life.... He recognized what was at stake." [...] Cruise felt von Stauffenberg did not think of himself as a hero. The actor prepared for the role for eight months by hiring a researcher, studying history books, and speaking with some of von Stauffenberg's family. Since von Stauffenberg lost his left eye, right hand and two fingers on his left hand in an Allied attack in Tunisia, Cruise affected the same disabilities to practice dressing, moving items and writing. Cruise initially found the eyepatch difficult to work with but acknowledged that von Stauffenberg had to live with this discomfort.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll {{put them}} on when I pass through the kitchen. I won't be long away. Now go to bed. You are looking tired," [...] he said gently, as he gazed at the drawn lines about her eyes and mouth. Her former pretty color <b>struck</b> <b>him</b> also <b>as</b> having changed of late, and as being {{irregular}} and inharmonious.|$|R
60|$|Then, ere {{those other}} two had {{recovered}} themselves, he ran {{at a second}} and <b>struck</b> <b>him</b> so fierce a blow that his wits left him, and he staggered like a drunken man and ran around and around in a circle, not knowing whither he went. Then he rushed upon the third and thrust him back with great violence, and as he went back Sir Launcelot <b>struck</b> <b>him,</b> too, <b>as</b> he had struck his companions and therewith that knight dropped his sword and fell down upon his knees and had not power to raise himself up.|$|R
6000|$|So he had; {{and more}} than everything. At the last an idea <b>struck</b> <b>him</b> that <b>as</b> he was getting so much {{he might as well}} have a little more. He {{therefore}} added several good-sized amounts which he called 'debts of honour.' This would, he thought, appeal to the feminine mind. Stephen did not look at the papers at once. She stood up, holding them, and said to Miss Rowly: ...|$|R
500|$|Alberts {{came back}} to the Canucks with {{improved}} play during the 2010 pre-season and beat out Shane O'Brien for the team's final spot on defense (O'Brien was subsequently traded {{prior to the start of}} the season). Nearly a month into the season, Alberts suffered a minor knee injury during a game against the Colorado Avalanche, but did not miss any games. Later in the season, he was sucker-punched in the face by enforcer Jody Shelley during a game against the Flyers in December 2010. The two were being restrained by referees during a scrum when Shelley <b>struck</b> <b>him.</b> <b>As</b> a result, he received a two-game suspension from the league and forfeited [...] $26,829.27 in salary. Though Alberts left the game, he was not injured on the play. The following month, Alberts suffered a right shoulder injury during a game against the Minnesota Wild on January 16, 2011. Shortly after recovering and returning to the lineup, he suffered another injury, breaking his wrist while blocking a shot during a game against the St. Louis Blues on February 14, 2011. He missed the remainder of the regular season, finishing with a goal and seven assists, while leading Canucks defensemen with 113 hits, over 42 games. Recovering in time for the playoffs, Alberts appeared in nine post-season games (he did not register any points) during the Canucks' run to the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, where they were defeated in seven games by the Boston Bruins. During the off-season, Alberts was re-signed by the Canucks to a two-year, $2.45 million deal on June 29, 2011 (two days prior to his pending unrestricted free agency).|$|E
2500|$|... "Stupid", especially, {{looks to}} Gasparoli {{as if it}} might have been written {{separately}} from the other words, as it is written much more clearly and off to the side. The swash extending leftward from the counter on the [...] "P" [...] in [...] "STUPID", <b>struck</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> unusually distinctive. [...] " [...] looks quite different, much more precise than any other letter in the note," [...] he says. It seems to Gasparoli to suggest a female writer, or at least one calmer and more intelligent than the lettering elsewhere on the note.|$|E
2500|$|The Considérations was one {{of several}} works that Mirabeau wrote in the year 1785, and it is a good {{specimen}} of his method. He had read a pamphlet published in America attacking the order, founded in 1783 as a bond of association between officers who had fought in the American Revolutionary War against Britain. The arguments <b>struck</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> true and valuable, so he rearranged them in his own fashion, and rewrote them in his own oratorical style. He supplemented the work with materials provided personally by Benjamin Franklin, who shared Mirabeau's opinions on the topic, but was {{not in a position to}} criticize the [...] "noble order" [...] espoused by the Society of the Cincinnati directly, because he was serving as the United States Minister to France at the time.|$|E
60|$|He {{forced himself}} to get up, and stood still, {{shivering}} in every limb, while a bitter wind <b>struck</b> through <b>him</b> <b>as</b> he gathered his resolution together. Then, stripping off his deerskin jacket, he flung it over one arm as he turned toward his companions' shelter. Kinnaird was awake, and his daughter cried out drowsily when Weston stood looking down at him.|$|R
60|$|Clarence's heart sank. He {{had heard}} already of the exaggeration of California prices. Twenty dollars! It was half his fortune. Nevertheless, with an heroic effort, he {{controlled}} himself, and with slightly nervous fingers counted out the money. It <b>struck</b> <b>him,</b> however, <b>as</b> curious, {{not to say}} ungentlemanly, that the bystanders craned their necks {{over his shoulder to}} look at the contents of his purse, although some slight explanation was offered by the tall man.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell {{him it was}} {{his fault}} as much as ours. We did not see <b>him</b> till we <b>struck</b> <b>him.</b> And <b>as</b> for his companion, what chance was there of finding him on such a dark night as this? Why, {{by the time we}} had hove round and got back again we might not have hit it within a quarter of a mile. Besides, if he had been alive he would have shouted." ...|$|R
2500|$|One of {{the studies}} he had been {{involved}} in at the Conservation Research office was on electric cars powered by conventional lead-acid batteries. None of these <b>struck</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> practical, but he was convinced that electric traction was the future. He told Discover Magazine in a 2002 interview that [...] "My goal from the very beginning was replacing the internal combustion engine -- just getting that off the streets." [...] Ballard had earlier met Ralph Schwartz in Arizona, who introduced him to the idea of using lithium batteries in place of lead-acid, as they would be much lighter. However, at the time, lithium batteries were not able to be recharged. Schwartz convinced Ballard that they should study the problem, and Ballard cashed in his pension to buy a portion of their new joint venture, American Energizer.|$|E
6000|$|She {{looked at}} him in that way she had which never quite <b>struck</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> {{straight}} and clear, yet which always <b>struck</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> kind and true. “Oh, if we come to London I should think you’d sufficiently hear of it.” ...|$|E
60|$|A sudden thought <b>struck</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> {{he heard}} a {{rustling}} in the bushes near.|$|E
6000|$|... "He was {{bringing}} disgrace on you, Larry, {{and on your}} name; he was disgracing your family and your daughter, and myself; he was dragging Feemy away with him by night. I saw him with her, speechless and fainting in his arms, and I <b>struck</b> <b>him</b> down <b>as</b> {{he was doing it}} with my stick. I didn't think, father, to strike so hard, but his skull was broken, and he died without a struggle."--The old man still stared at him, and Thady continued, ...|$|R
60|$|The governess laughingly {{accepted}} the conditions, Eve took {{the arm of}} her father, and Sir George offered his to Grace; Aristabulus, to his surprise, being left to walk entirely alone. It <b>struck</b> <b>him,</b> however, <b>as</b> so singularly improper that a young lady should be supported on such an occasion by her own father, that he frankly and gallantly proposed to Mr. Effingham to relieve him of his burthen, an offer that was declined with quite as much distinctness as it was made.|$|R
6000|$|The {{use of a}} dead man's authority, {{employed}} {{against him}} by one who was, so to say, his own servant, <b>struck</b> even <b>him</b> <b>as</b> absurd and improper. He felt that he must assert himself unless he meant to sink lower and lower in the estimation of all those around him. [...] "I shall stay just as late as I please," [...] he said. [...] "Go away, and do not disturb me any more." ...|$|R
60|$|But Nunez's {{manner of}} {{receiving}} {{the good news}} <b>struck</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> being cold and disappointing.|$|E
60|$|The {{idea had}} {{occurred}} to him just before he spoke. It had <b>struck</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> neat and plausible.|$|E
60|$|What {{should he}} {{ask for the}} thing? Somehow twenty {{thousand}} pounds <b>struck</b> <b>him</b> <b>as</b> about the sum indicated.|$|E
60|$|Among {{the prisoners}} taken at Naseby was Harry Furness, whose troop {{had been with}} Langdale's horse, and who, his charger having been shot, had fallen upon the field, his head being cut by the sweep of the sword of a Roundhead soldier, who <b>struck</b> at <b>him</b> <b>as</b> {{he was lying on}} the ground. Soon after the battle, when it became known what prisoners had been taken, he was visited by his friend Herbert.|$|R
25|$|The idea of {{building}} a hilltop resort was first conceived when Lim Goh Tong was having a dinner in the Cameron Highlands. As he was enjoying the soothing cool breeze of the Cameron Highlands, an idea <b>struck</b> <b>him</b> that <b>as</b> {{the standard of living}} rose steadily in Malaysia, more and more people would visit mountain resorts for relaxation and recreation, but Cameron Highlands was too far away from the capital city Kuala Lumpur, therefore building a mountain resort nearer to Kuala Lumpur would have great business potential.|$|R
6000|$|I {{answered}} yes, if she {{and those}} with her were quite quiet. Then I led them into the darkened room where Quick stood like a statue {{at the head of}} the bed, only acknowledging her presence with a silent salute. She gazed at Oliver's flushed face and the forehead blackened where the gases from the explosion had <b>struck</b> <b>him,</b> and <b>as</b> she gazed I saw her beautiful violet eyes fill with tears. Then abruptly she turned and left the sick-chamber. Outside its doors she waved back her attendants imperiously and asked me in a whisper: ...|$|R
