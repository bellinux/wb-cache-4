Differences between well-being scores in <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> and agreement were interpreted as reflecting the degree of spouses' interdependence. It was found that spouses in Western countries depend on each other more in personal decisions than do spouses in more traditional, non-Western countries. Specifically, spouses from traditionally patriarchal families in India and Turkey depended least upon each other. This was expected, due to culturally and historically prescribed differences {{in the degree of}} role segregation between spouses. The stronger the role-segregation in traditional societies, the less spouses depend upon each other in personal matters. It was also found that husbands are more autonomous in their decisions than wives, specifically in male-dominated Western families. Male dominance in Western families appears to be based on different mechanisms than patriarchy in traditional non-Western marriages...|$|R

50|$|Clive Reed is Alex's co-worker, {{and even}} Alex's boss from June 2004 to October 2005 (afterwards he got side-lined by Rupert {{but refused to}} resign, thus forced to accept a demotion). Until {{recently}} {{he lived with his}} longterm girlfriend and subsequent wife Bridget. Although a fellow Oxford graduate, Clive is Alex's inferior in every way. He is less socially skilled, and frequently commits embarrassing gaffes in public. He is less professionally skilled, and often makes bad financial investments or fails to manage his subordinates. Alex enjoys Clive's company because it provides many opportunities to show his superiority. Clive is also a dreadful wimp, and readily retreats from any <b>situation</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> or difficulty. In spite of this, Clive is something of a womaniser, and has enjoyed a moderate amount of success. In particular, Clive had a long and guilt-ridden affair with an American colleague Ruth while he was engaged to Bridget. Clive also enjoys just enough professional success to maintain his career and his affluent lifestyle. In August 2008, Clive was made redundant, a fact Alex knew but used to win a bet. However, he soon returned after it emerged that the bank had fired the wrong Clive Reed. In 2013, Clive and Bridget had a pair of twins, after years of failed IVF's.|$|E
5000|$|The classic International Legal Process is {{the method}} of {{studying}} how international law is practically applied to, and functions within international policy, {{as well as the}} study of how international law can be improved. [...] "It concentrates not so much on the exposition of rules and their content as on how international legal rules are actually used by the makers of foreign policy". ILP was developed in response to the [...] "realists from the discipline of international relations", who realized with the beginning of the Cold War how little international law played a role in international affairs. ILP was made a legitimate theory in the 1968 casebook International Legal Process, by Chayes, Ehrlich and Lowenfeld, in which the American legal process method was adapted to create an international legal process. ILP describes the way international legal processes work, and the formal and informal ways that foreign offices incorporate international law. ILP also measures the extent to which individuals are held accountable for abuses in international conflicts. While ILP recognizes that international law does not force decision makers' actions, it suggests that international law serves as a justification, constraint, and organizing device. Criticism of ILP's lack of normative qualities in its method resulted in {{the emergence of a new}} ILP.The New International Legal Process (NLP) incorporates both law as a process and as the values of each society respectively. Unlike the American Legal System, it considers normative values other than democracy, such as [...] "…feminism, republicanism, law and economics, liberalism as well as human rights, peace and protection to the environment." [...] The NLP is unique in its flexibility in adapting to the evolution of values. This component of the method is important in order to resolve the changing of legal standards over time. The NLPshows its true departure from the ILP by addressing what happens in the <b>situation</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict,</b> as well as what should be happening.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{engages with}} the {{question}} of the invention of martial arts by examining the case of the Japanese martial art aikido. Relying on existing schools of traditional martial arts, Morihei Ueshiba [1883 - 1969] created aikido with the goal of transforming techniques aiming at killing the opponent into techniques which could benefit both partners. Instead of becoming stronger than the opponent, the goal of aikido practice is to improve the individual’s behaviour during their physical interaction with their partner. The question I examine in this paper is how practitioners manifest such philosophy during their practice and through their embodied conduct. I focus specifically on how practitioners simulate a <b>situation</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict</b> through semiotic structures [Goodwin 2000] through which they construct a world of movement in which anticipating the attacker’s movement becomes possible. Because practitioners are organized with such a framework, they can, through movements of the whole body, pacifically produce and resolve the <b>situation</b> <b>of</b> <b>conflict.</b> This study contributes to understanding how a practical philosophy is implemented within the practitioners’ bodies and is manifested during social interaction...|$|E

40|$|The {{expansion}} of universities' missions {{to include the}} support of regional economic development has led to conflicts between traditional norms of open science and the norms of entrepreneurialism, as well as placing university faculty in <b>situations</b> <b>of</b> potential <b>conflict</b> <b>of</b> interest. We posit that there are important differences between how universities support regional economic development in terms of leading to normative and ethical conflicts. Using data from two independent samples of U. S. and European faculty, we explore and compare faculty attitudes towards regional engagement and knowledge commercialization using factor analysis. The results show that U. S. faculty make {{a clear distinction between}} the appropriateness of university regional engagement, on the one hand, and knowledge commercialization, on the other.
