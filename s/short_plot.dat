500|$|... "Jake the Brick" [...] {{was written}} and storyboarded by Adventure Time head writer Kent Osborne, from {{a story by}} Adam Muto, Osborne, Jack Pendarvis, and series creator Pendleton Ward. Osborne also served as the episode's supervising director, while the art {{direction}} was helmed by Nick Jennings. The genesis for the episode {{can be traced back}} to a drawing made during a game of exquisite corpse by Tom Herpich. The quick doodle, which featured Finn offering a brick-shaped Jake a sandwich, was accompanied by a <b>short</b> <b>plot</b> synopsis involving Jake's son Kim Kil Whan. The plot was never used, but Osborne and the crew found the drawing so amusing that they decided to work it into an episode. In reality, [...] "Jake the Brick" [...] was one of the few episodes to have been generated from a game of exquisite corpse. According to Ward, most of the ideas that come from the game are [...] "terrible". A large portion of the dialogue used in the final episode was written by Pendarvis.|$|E
60|$|The late King {{had watched}} these dissensions from England, {{sensible}} (like the French people) that no enemy of France could injure {{her more than}} her own nobility. The present King now advanced a claim to the French throne. His demand being, of course, refused, he reduced his proposal to a certain large amount of French territory, and to demanding the French princess, Catherine, in marriage, with a fortune of two millions of golden crowns. He was offered less territory and fewer crowns, and no princess; but he called his ambassadors home and prepared for war. Then, he proposed to take the princess with one million of crowns. The French Court replied {{that he should have}} the princess with two hundred thousand crowns less; he said this would not do (he had never seen the princess in his life), and assembled his army at Southampton. There was a <b>short</b> <b>plot</b> at home just at that time, for deposing him, and making the Earl of March king; but the conspirators were all speedily condemned and executed, and the King embarked for France.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of slope length on runoff and {{suspended}} sediment yield has been investigated by using plots on uniform slopes under natural rainfall conditions. From September 2007 to September 2009, during two year-period, measurements were done in Dallıca village experimental area in Bartın province. In this study, six field plots with a width of 1. 87 m were used. Three of them were 5. 5 m long (<b>short</b> <b>plots)</b> and remaining three were 11. 05 m long (long plots). Plots were located on bare soil surface that has no conservative vegetation. During the period of experimentation, a total of 158 rainy days were registered and average annual rainfall amount was 1194. 8 mm. Average annual runoff per square meter was 270. 81 mm, and 311. 27 mm in long and <b>short</b> <b>plots,</b> respectively. Average annual suspended sediment was 809. 68 g m- 2, and 766. 53 g m- 2 from long and <b>short</b> <b>plots,</b> respectively.

50|$|Seen today, early {{issues of}} the {{magazine}} appear somewhat faceless, often consisting merely of an editorial followed by film pictorials with <b>short</b> <b>plot</b> synopses. However, around 1971/1972 the magazine began to develop more of a personality, with such regular features as 'Flash', a column by the film critic Peter Noble (1917-1997) on upcoming films, and articles on mainstream film stars under the heading 'Cine Go Round'. The 'Cineclub 24 Scene' and 'Cinecenta Scene' sections covered films that played at Membership Only Adult Cinemas. During this period the magazine was published by Top Sellers Ltd, a company that also produced saucy books and posters, {{many of which were}} advertised in the magazine. The magazine also began accepting outside advertising; Subdean, the first company of David Sullivan, advertised in the magazine in 1972.

5000|$|OVA titles have a {{reputation}} for the detailed plots and character-development which can result from the greater creative freedom offered to writers and directors in comparison with other formats. This also allows for animated adaptations of manga to reflect their source material more faithfully. Since OVA episodes and series have no fixed conventional length, OVA directors can use however much time they like to tell the story. Time becomes available for significant background, character, and plot development. This contrasts with television episodes (which must begin and conclude in 22 to 26 minutes) and with films (which rarely last more than two hours). In the same way, no pressure exists to produce [...] "filler content" [...] to extend a <b>short</b> <b>plot</b> into a full television series. The producers of OVA titles generally target a specific audience, rather than the more mass-market audience of films and television series, or may feel less constrained by content-restrictions and censorship (such as for violence, nudity, and language) often placed on television series. For example, the Kissxsis OVA series generally contains more sexual themes than its television counterpart.|$|E

It consists of theoretical and practical parts. The first chapter discusses the basic characteristics of fairytales, its definition, features, classification. Furthermore, the work deals with theories about the origin of folktales and ways of their analysis from a scientific point of view. At the end of the this part fairytales are analysed as a literary genre. The second part represents writers Charles Perrault, Brothers Grimm, Karel Jaromír Erben Božena Němcová. Each of these authors approaches to their fairytale works in a different way, which is described in this section. In chapters of each writer, we first learn about their biography, as well as the time in which they lived, along with its historical and social background and last but not least, with their literary production with an emphasis on fairytale work. The last chapter contains a practical part of thesis. There is comparison of two magic fairytales, that appear in the works of authors from the second chapter.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to determine empirically the plot width and length effects on runoff volume, Ve, soil loss, Ae, and sediment concentration, Ce, by using data collected, at the temporal scale of the erosive event, on bare plots differing in width (2 to 8 m) and length (11 to 22 m) for two Italian stations (Masse, Umbria; Sparacia, Sicily). Mean results differed by a maximum factor of 1. 6 for Ve, 1. 8 for Ae and 1. 2 for Ce when plots differing in width were compared and by a maximum factor of 1. 4 for Ve, 1. 2 for Ae and 1. 3 for Ce when comparison between plot lengths was conducted. Differences between two plot widths or two plot lengths were not statistically significant (P = 0. 01). Soil loss was the variable most sensitive to plot size (maximum factor of discrepancy equal to 11. 6 for plot width and 25. 0 for plot length). Plot width and length effects varied with event erosivity, being low for the most erosive events. Relatively <b>short</b> and narrow <b>plots</b> may give long term results representative of longer and wider plots within the sampled sizes. An appropriate sampling scheme may be based on relatively narrow and <b>short</b> <b>plots</b> instead of wide and long plots, with a reduction of experimental efforts, at least when the events of interest are the most erosive ones. Reducing plot length from 22 m to 11 m is not expected to reduce soil loss per unit area at the two considered locations...|$|R
