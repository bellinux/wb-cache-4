2500|$|During the Second World War, Germany {{used the}} code names W Salt, SH Salt, K-method, the E-method and the KA-method. These names {{represented}} {{the identities of}} the developers of the various chemical routes to RDX. The W-method was developed by Wolfram in 1934 and gave RDX the code name [...] "W-Salz". It used <b>sulfamic</b> <b>acid,</b> formaldehyde, and nitric acid. SH-Salz (SH salt) was from Schnurr who developed a batch-process in 1937–38 based on nitrolysis of hexamine. The K-method, from Knöffler, involved addition of ammonium nitrate to the hexamine/nitric acid process. The E-method, developed by Ebele, proved to be identical to the Ross and Schiessler process described below. The KA-method, also developed by Knöffler, and turned out to be identical to the Bachmann process described below.|$|E
40|$|While {{manufacturing}} {{a number}} of important tubular products stringent requirements have been imposed on quality of their inner surfaces. The well-known methods for inner surface treatment of pipes include sandblasting, chemical cleaning with acid reagents (oxalic, formic, <b>sulfamic,</b> orthophosphoric <b>acids)</b> and electrochemical polishing. Disadvantages of the chemical method are cleaning-up irregularities, high metal removal, limited number of reagent application, complicated selection of reagent chemical composition and concentration, complicated and environmentally harmful recycling of waste chemicals, high cost of reagents. Low productivity at a high cost, as well as hazardous impact on personnel due to high dispersion of abrasive dust are considered as disadvantages of sandblasting. Electrochemical polishing is characterized by the following disadvantages: low processing productivity because supply of high currents is rather difficult due to electrolyte scattering capacity away from the main electrode action zone, limited length of the cavity to be treated due to heating of flexible current leads at operating current densities, application of expensive aggressive electrolytes and high costs of their recycling. A new method for polishing and cleaning of inner surfaces of tubular products based on electrolyte-plasma treatment has been developed. In comparison with the existing methods the proposed methods ensures quality processing with high intensity while applying non-toxic, environmentally friendly and cheap electrolytes. The paper presents results of investigations on technological specific features of electrolyte-plasma treatment for inner surfaces of tubular products: influence of slotted nozzle width, electrolyte flow and rate on stability of gas-vapor blanket, current density and productivity. Results of the research have made it possible to determine modes that provide stability and high productivity in the process of electrolyte-plasma treatment of inner surfaces of tubular products. </p...|$|R
40|$|Polyaniline shows great {{potential}} and promises wide application in the biomedical field {{thanks to its}} intrinsic conductivity and material properties, which closely resemble natural tissues. Surface properties are crucial, as these predetermine any interaction with biological fluids, proteins and cells. An advantage of polyaniline is the simple modification of its surface, e. g., by using various dopant acids. An investigation was made into the adhesion, proliferation and migration of mouse embryonic fibroblasts on pristine polyaniline films and films doped with <b>sulfamic</b> and phosphotungstic <b>acids.</b> In addition, polyaniline films supplemented with poly (2 -acrylamido- 2 -methyl- 1 -propanesulfonic) acid at various ratios were tested. Results showed that the NIH/ 3 T 3 cell line was able to adhere, proliferate and migrate on the pristine polyaniline films {{as well as those}} films doped with sulfamic and phosphotungstic acids; thus, utilization of said forms in biomedicine appears promising. Nevertheless, incorporating poly (2 -acrylamido- 2 -methyl- 1 -propanesulfonic) acid altered the surface properties of the polyaniline films and significantly affected cell behavior. In order to reveal the crucial factor influencing the surface/cell interaction, cell behavior is discussed {{in the context of the}} surface energy of individual samples. It was clearly demonstrated that the lesser the difference between the surface energy of the sample and cell, the more cyto-compatible the surface is. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

50|$|<b>Sulfamic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is used as}} an acidic {{cleaning}} agent, sometimes pure or as {{a component}} of proprietary mixtures, typically for metals and ceramics. It is frequently used for removing rust and limescale, replacing the more volatile and irritating hydrochloric acid, which is however cheaper. It is often a component of household descaling agents, for example, Lime-A-Way Thick Gel contains up to 8% <b>sulfamic</b> <b>acid</b> and pH 2-2.2, or detergents used for removal of limescale. When compared to most of the common strong mineral acids, <b>sulfamic</b> <b>acid</b> has desirable water descaling properties, low volatility, low toxicity.

50|$|Importantly, <b>sulfamic</b> <b>acid</b> is {{preferable}} to use in household in comparison to hydrochloric acid for its intrinsic safety. If erroneously mixed with hypochlorite based products such as bleach, it does not form chlorine gas, where the most common acids would; the reaction (neutralization) with NH3, produces a salt as depicted in the section above.|$|E
