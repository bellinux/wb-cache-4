5|$|Dunstan also faced {{difficulties}} {{on policy}} issues. Factional cracks {{began to appear}} in Labor and the discovery of uranium deposits near the northern outback town of Roxby Downs put the premier in a bind. The uranium was seen as a valuable economic boost in difficult times, but a government ban on its mining on <b>safety</b> <b>grounds</b> was still in force. Dunstan was opposed to uranium mining but he was seen as lacking in conviction by environmentalists, as well as being criticised by industrialists. By May, his approval rating had fallen to 57%, down from 80% just two years earlier, while unemployment increased. It was also widely anticipated that a book named It's Grossly Improper would soon be released, containing embarrassing allegations about Dunstan's private life.|$|E
5|$|In {{the week}} before the Final, a block of 1,600 tickets in the Liverpool supporters' seating area was stolen in the postal system. The stadium {{authorities}} refused to reissue the tickets on crowd <b>safety</b> <b>grounds,</b> and threatened to eject anyone found sitting in the block from the stadium and possibly prosecute them for receiving stolen goods. Liverpool F.C. arranged for most of the affected fans to receive tickets from an allocation that had been held back for a lottery among their supporters. The day after the final, South Wales Police seized 100 stolen tickets. Three people were arrested after 15 forged tickets were found ahead of the match.|$|E
5|$|Construction of a {{connection}} between the river and the Trent and Mersey Canal was begun in 1871 and completed in 1875. Because of the difference in level, a vertical boat lift was designed by Edwin Clark, using counterbalanced tanks which were linked by a hydraulic system. A descending tank caused hydraulic fluid to enter the pistons which raised the other tank. The design was a success, but the fluid became contaminated, resulting in corrosion of the pistons. The lift was replaced by a new design, where each tank was attached to its own counterbalance weight by wire ropes and pulleys, with small electric motors to overcome friction. The new lift was built {{over the top of the}} old one, so that it could continue to be used until the new one was ready, and the work was carried out by staff of the Navigation, supervised by the engineer J A Saner. It was completed in 1906, and continued in use until 1983, when it was closed on <b>safety</b> <b>grounds</b> due to corrosion.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{stage pin}} {{connectors}} have incorporated a third pin for a <b>safety</b> <b>ground</b> connection and are {{commonly referred to}} as two pin and ground (2P&G) to distinguish them from their ungrounded two-pin predecessors. The ground pin is situated between the line and neutral pins and closer to the latter. This asymmetrical configuration effectively polarizes the connector ensuring that the line and neutral conductors are not exchanged in a properly wired installation. The ground pin is also longer than the other two, ensuring that the <b>safety</b> <b>ground</b> connection is made first when making a connection.|$|R

Busbars may be enclosed in a metal housing, in the form of bus duct or busway, segregated-phase bus, or isolated-phase bus.|$|R
5|$|Population {{studies from}} the mid-20th century onwards show topical {{fluoride}} reduces dental caries. This was first {{attributed to the}} conversion of tooth enamel hydroxyapatite into the more durable fluorapatite, but studies on pre-fluoridated teeth refuted this hypothesis, and current theories involve fluoride aiding enamel growth in small caries. After studies of children in areas where fluoride was naturally present in drinking water, controlled public water supply fluoridation to fight tooth decay began in the 1940s and is now applied to water supplying 6 percent of the global population, including two-thirds of Americans. Reviews of the scholarly literature in 2000 and 2007 associated water fluoridation with a significant reduction of tooth decay in children. Despite such endorsements and evidence of no adverse effects other than mostly benign dental fluorosis, opposition still exists on ethical and <b>safety</b> <b>grounds.</b> The benefits of fluoridation have lessened, possibly due to other fluoride sources, but are still measurable in low-income groups. Sodium monofluorophosphate and sometimes sodium or tin(II) fluoride are often found in fluoride toothpastes, first introduced in the U.S. in 1955 and now ubiquitous in developed countries, alongside fluoridated mouthwashes, gels, foams, and varnishes.|$|E
5|$|Sergio Pérez was demoted to seventh {{with the}} {{application}} of a gearbox penalty, following a change made necessary after he hit the barrier in turn 15 during the last practice session. This promoted Ricciardo, Vettel, Räikkönen, Massa, and Kvyat up the grid in the process. Sainz and Magnussen were also demoted, with Magnussen having to start from the pit lane. Lewis Hamilton was given permission to change his front left tyre ahead of the race. Under the regulations, a driver who qualifies in the top ten must start the race on the set of tyres they used to record their best time {{in the second part of}} qualifying. However, Hamilton's front left tyre, which belonged to the set of tyres that he subsequently used to set his fastest time during his next flying lap, was deemed to be too damaged following his lock-up going into turn seven, necessitating its change on <b>safety</b> <b>grounds.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{trend toward}} {{artificial}} ice was hastened by the regular ice famines during the period, {{such as the}} 1898 British famine, which typically caused rapid price increases, fuelled demand for plant ice and encouraged investment in the new technologies. Concerns also grew over the safety of natural ice. Initial reports concerning ice being produced from polluted or unclean lakes and rivers had first emerged in the U.S. {{as early as the}} 1870s. The British public health authorities believed Norwegian ice was generally much purer and safer than American sourced ice, but reports in 1904 noted the risk of contamination in transit and recommended moving to the use of plant ice. In 1907, New York specialists claimed ice from the Hudson River to be unsafe for consumption and potentially containing typhoid germs; the report was successfully challenged by the natural ice industry, but public opinion was turning against natural ice on <b>safety</b> <b>grounds.</b> These fears of contamination was often played on by artificial ice manufacturers in their advertising. Major damage was also done to the industry by fire, including a famous blaze at the American Ice Company facilities at Iceoboro in 1910, which destroyed the buildings and the adjacent schooners, causing around $130,000 ($2,300,000 in 2010 terms) of damage and crippling the Maine ice industry.|$|E
5000|$|Removal of the <b>safety</b> <b>ground</b> {{connection}} on equipment can expose {{users to}} an increased danger of electric shock and may contradict wiring regulations. The <b>safety</b> <b>ground</b> is disconnected by an adaptor (cheater plug) in a power lead in which the ground conductor is deliberately disconnected, or by cutting a ground pin in the power plug. If a fault develops in any line-operated equipment, cable shields and equipment enclosures may become energized, creating an electric shock hazard. For example, the metal shell of a stage microphone or the strings of a guitar may become energized, creating a hazard to performers. [...] (See Leslie Harvey, John Rostill, Keith Relf) ...|$|R

40|$|Electronically {{monitoring}} {{whether or}} not your car block heater is connected to a mains outlet might at first seem like an arbitrary task. A device installed {{in the comfort of}} the car seating area, which tells the user at every startup {{whether or not}} his/her car is connected to a mains outlet, could have market appeal though. But in order for it to be a worthwhile idea to pursuit, a certain requirement has to be met. It {{has to be able to}} be able to accurately detect whether or not the car is connected, through a single connection; the car ground. A certain part of the voltage in the phase of the mains will be capacitively coupled upon the <b>safety</b> <b>ground.</b> By exploiting the fact that the car ground will be connected to the mains <b>safety</b> <b>ground</b> when the block heater cable is in use, a device which can detect that coupled voltage could possibly be developed. In other words, a cable monitoring unit which in actuality detects a connection to the mains <b>safety</b> <b>ground</b> through capacitive coupling, hence the title of this dissertation. This work sets out to taking appropriate measurements to find out whether or not this proposed method of <b>safety</b> <b>ground</b> detection is valid, with heavy emphasis on whether or not it is applicable to a cable monitoring unit. According to the measurement results, an appropriate device is developed. A device which can fill the function described in the previous paragraph. Development of such a device involves; proper method of supplying power which upholds a galvanically isolated floating ground, signal processing, reliable detection mechanism, and considerations to how unintentional capacitive coupling behaves. A theoretical model of the device is put forth, as well as an actual rough prototype to in practice try to prove that the concept and method is valid. Downsides and problems with the device are discussed, such as upholding an effective detection system without making the device hard and cumbersome to use. Possible solutions to these problems are also proposed. The possible future of the concept of this device is also touched upon...|$|R
