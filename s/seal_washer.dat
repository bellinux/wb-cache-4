25|$|The sealing {{materials}} of aluminum electrolytic capacitors {{depend on the}} different styles. For larger screw-terminal and snap-in capacitors the <b>sealing</b> <b>washer</b> is made of a plastic material. Axial electrolytic capacitors usually have a <b>sealing</b> <b>washer</b> made of phenolic resin laminated {{with a layer of}} rubber. Radial electrolytic capacitors use a rubber plug with a very dense structure. All sealing materials must be inert to the chemical parts of the electrolyte and may not contain soluble compounds that could lead to contamination of the electrolyte. To avoid leakage, the electrolyte must not be aggressive to the sealing material.|$|R
50|$|Leaks {{are often}} {{repaired}} by plugging the leaking holes or using a patch to cover them. Leaking tires are often fixed this way. Leaking gaskets, <b>seals,</b> <b>washers,</b> or packing can be replaced. Use of welding, soldering, sealing, or gluing {{may be other}} ways to fix leaks. Sometimes, the most practical solution is to replace the leaking unit. Leaking water heaters are often replaced by home or building owners.|$|R
50|$|In {{common with}} tanks of this period, but in {{contrast}} to crawler tractors, the suspension had considerable articulation and permitted high speeds. The Vigor was capable of nearly 10 mph, when the comparable Caterpillar D8 could only reach 5 mph. The four roadwheels were linked as two bogies on each side. Pairs of bogies on opposite side were linked by an articulated beam with a centre tilt pivot. This suspension required a flexible track and Vickers developed one with rubber <b>sealing</b> <b>washers</b> between the moving parts. This could be a drawback, as wear to the rubber in service could make the track floppy. Together with the great suspension articulation, if not well-maintained, the Vigor could be prone to throwing tracks when run at speed.|$|R
25|$|This system, {{invented by}} Albert Giblin and {{common in the}} UK, uses a storage tank {{similar to that used}} in the flapper-flush-valve system above. This flush valve system is {{sometimes}} referred to as a valveless system, since no traditional type of valve is required. Some would argue, however, that any system of regulating the flow of a fluid is still technically a valve. In the siphon-flush-valve system, the user pushes a lever or button, forcing the water up into the tank siphon passageway which then empties the water in the tank into the bowl. The advantage of a siphon over the flush valve is that it has no <b>sealing</b> <b>washers</b> that can wear out and cause leaks, so it is favoured in places where {{there is a need to}} conserve water.|$|R

50|$|In 1872, British {{soft drink}} maker Hiram Codd of Camberwell, London, {{designed}} and patented the Codd-neck bottle, {{designed specifically for}} carbonated drinks. The Codd-neck bottle encloses a marble and a rubber washer/gasket in the neck. The bottles were filled upside down, and pressure of the gas in the bottle forced the marble against the <b>washer,</b> <b>sealing</b> in the carbonation. The bottle was pinched into a special shape to provide a chamber into which the marble was pushed to open the bottle. This prevented the marble from blocking the neck as the drink was poured.|$|R

BACKGROUND OF INVENTION Transformers and bushings form {{an integral part of}} any electrical power distribution and transmission system that also include other type of transformers like rectifier transformers, locomotive transformers. One of the important components of the insulation of oil filled transformers comprises paper which is wound around the copper windings. There are spacers, <b>washers,</b> <b>seals,</b> separators, composed of paper or compressed board having characteristics that of paper. In order to enhance the insulatio...|$|R
25|$|A {{persistent}} {{problem in}} the soft drinks industry {{was the lack of}} an effective sealing of the bottles. Carbonated drink bottles are under great pressure from the gas, so inventors tried to find the best way to prevent the carbon dioxide or bubbles from escaping. The bottles could also explode if the pressure was too great. Hiram Codd devised a patented bottling machine while working at a small mineral water works in the Caledonian Road, Islington, in London in 1870. His Codd-neck bottle was designed to enclose a marble and a rubber washer in the neck. The bottles were filled upside down, and pressure of the gas in the bottle forced the marble against the <b>washer,</b> <b>sealing</b> in the carbonation. The bottle was pinched into a special shape to provide a chamber into which the marble was pushed to open the bottle. This prevented the marble from blocking the neck as the drink was poured.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{two different}} experiments on connections of trapezoidal sheets under elevated temperatures. The first experiments were tensile tests {{carried out on}} four sets of tests with screwed connections under ambient and elevated temperatures. One diameter of self-drilling screws and three different thicknesses of trapezoidal sheets were used. The applied screws were without <b>washers,</b> or with <b>sealed</b> or steel <b>washers.</b> The second experiment was performed in a laboratory furnace to check the catenary action of a thin-walled trapezoidal sheet. The basic theory tested in this experiment {{was that in the}} first phase of the fire the sheet behaves as a simply supported beam, while in the second phase the load bearing is transferred by a tension membrane. These experiments will be used to develop a design model of connections at high temperatures. High fire resistance of the trapezoidal sheet, dependent on suitable design of the screwed connection to the bearing structure, was confirmed. The experiment with the simple beam also confirmed catenary action. ...|$|R
