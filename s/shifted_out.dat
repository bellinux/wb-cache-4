5|$|In 1919, the MSHD signposted {{the highway}} {{system for the}} first time, and the east–west highway through Port Huron {{was part of the}} {{original}} M-19, and the north–south highway was part of the original M-27. M-21 was extended over M-19 into Port Huron by 1924. On November 11, 1926, the United States Numbered Highway System was approved by the AASHO, and the new US25 replaced M-27 in the area. In 1964, a section of I-94 in the Port Huron area was completed. The former route of US25 through downtown was redesignated Bus. US25 when the main highway was <b>shifted</b> <b>out</b> to the freeway. The first freeway segment of M-21 was built into the Port Huron area in 1966; the freeway directly tied into the western end of the old route into downtown. In 1973, US25 was decommissioned in the state, and the former Bus. US25 was renumbered BL I-94. The remaining segment of freeway along the M-21 corridor opened in 1984 as I-69; after this freeway opened, M-21 was shortened to Flint, and the former M-21 in Port Huron became Business SpurI-69. To connect back to I-69, the business route was extended northward along BL I-94 when that highway was designated through downtown in 1986.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} highway {{designation}} and routing {{changes in the}} Pontiac were made when US10 was <b>shifted</b> <b>out</b> of downtown to replace M-58 along Telegraph Road west of downtown {{by the middle of}} 1961. Before the change, US10 followed Dixie Highway and Oakland Avenue southeast into Pontiac to Perry Street and then Perry to Woodward while M-58 was routed along Telegraph and Square Lake roads. After the change, US10 turned south from Dixie Highway onto Telegraph and then east onto Square Lake to connect back to Woodward. The old route through downtown was assigned the Bus. US10 moniker and M-58 was decommissioned as a highway designation. Two years later, I-75 was completed to the east of Pontiac, and the M-24 bypass of the city was turned over to local control. The former Bus. M-24 through downtown was renumbered BL I-75 along with a connection along Square Lake Road out to the freeway. The next year, the streets downtown Pontiac were reconfigured and a loop called Wide Track Drive was created to route traffic around the downtown area. The former routing of BL I-75 on Perry Street in the downtown core was replaced by routing the business loops on Wide Track Drive. Then in 1966, an interchange was built to replace the intersection at Opdyke Road and Square Lake Road.|$|E
5|$|In 1919 {{when the}} state highway system was first {{numbered}}, the north–south highway through Pontiac was numbered M-10, and it was renumbered to US10 seven years later when the United States Numbered Highway System was created.

US10 moniker and M-58 was decommissioned as a highway designation. Nine years later, US10 was moved off Woodward Avenue between Pontiac and Detroit to follow the Lodge Freeway and Telegraph Road. Bus. US10 was extended westward along Square Lake Road from the intersection of Woodward Avenue to the junction with Telegraph Road so that it would continue to connect with its parent highway on the southern end. In 1985, the Michigan Department of Transportation received permission from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials to truncate US10 to Bay City, and when the change was made the following year, US24 replaced US10 on Telegraph Road north of Square Lake Road, and Bus. US10 through downtown was redesignated Bus. US24.|$|E

25|$|Transmissions {{normally}} involve two shift registers of some given word size, such {{as eight}} bits, {{one in the}} master {{and one in the}} slave; they are connected in a virtual ring topology. Data is usually <b>shifted</b> <b>out</b> with the most-significant bit first, while shifting a new least-significant bit into the same register. At the same time, Data from the counterpart is shifted into the least-significant bit register. After the register bits have been <b>shifted</b> <b>out</b> and in, the master and slave have exchanged register values. If more data needs to be exchanged, the shift registers are reloaded and the process repeats. Transmission may continue for any number of clock cycles. When complete, the master stops toggling the clock signal, and typically deselects the slave.|$|E

25|$|A {{lighting}} ballast is {{a device}} to provide proper starting and operating electrical conditions to light one or more fluorescent lamps, while also limiting the amount of current. A familiar and widely used example is the traditional inductive ballast used in fluorescent lamps, to limit the current through the tube, which would otherwise rise to destructive levels due to the tube's negative resistance characteristic. A disadvantage of using an inductor is that current is <b>shifted</b> <b>out</b> of phase with the voltage, producing a poor power factor.|$|E

This is seen in Fig.  1 with D′ and the new equilibrium is designated by E 2. Note that the <b>shifting</b> <b>out</b> of the demand curve is direct for the pome (a) and prunus (b) output markets, but it is indirect in the pre-harvest (c) and post-harvest (d) labor input markets. That is, because {{of the increase in}} demand for output, producers demand more labor for each wage rate, and thus D′ <b>shifts</b> <b>out</b> compared to D in the input markets.|$|R
5000|$|Changes in {{productivity}} [...] - Productivity changes affect the resource demand in several ways. [...] Technological changes increase the marginal product of labor which makes labor more valuable and causes the demand curve to <b>shift</b> <b>out</b> [...] The quantity of other resources can affect productivity. The more machines labor {{has to work}} with the greater the marginal product of labor which will cause the resource demand curve to <b>shift</b> <b>out.</b> The quality of the resource {{is an important factor in}} determining the value of labor as a resource. For example, a highly educated and experienced labor force is generally more productive.|$|R

25|$|A {{disadvantage}} of the inductor is that current is <b>shifted</b> <b>out</b> of phase with the voltage, producing a poor power factor. In more expensive ballasts, a capacitor is often paired with the inductor {{to correct the}} power factor. In ballasts that control two or more lamps, line-frequency ballasts commonly use different phase relationships between the multiple lamps. This not only mitigates the flicker of the individual lamps, it also helps maintain a high power factor. These ballasts are often called lead-lag ballasts because the current in one lamp leads the mains phase and the current in the other lamp lags the mains phase.|$|E
25|$|The housing {{cooperative}} {{is a special}} legal entity, regulated in Swedish law. It has the same obligations of bookkeeping and issuing annual reports as companies and it can take mortgages in the property if needed. In addition, each member may also take mortgages in his bostadsrätt in order to finance his acquisition of it. The monthly fee paid by the members to the cooperative is intended to cover the operational and financial expenditures of the cooperative. The financial situation of the Swedish cooperatives vary a lot, and on rare occasions cooperatives may go bankrupt. If bankruptcy occurs, the property is sold and the remaining assets are <b>shifted</b> <b>out</b> to the members (who may stay on as tenants or try {{to form a new}} cooperative).|$|E
3000|$|Without modern sector expansion, {{there should}} also be {{contraction}} in employment in this sector, too. However, as outlined {{in the previous section}} and illustrated in Fig.  5, targeted policies for the modern sector will cause the marginal productivity of labor (the [...] p_ 2 K_ 2 h̃^'([...] L_ 2) [...] curve in Fig.  5) to <b>shift</b> <b>out,</b> and thus some increase in L 2. This will lead to positive growth in the modern sector and a rising capital–labor ratio, which means that the resulting increase in capital will cause the marginal productivity curve for labor to <b>shift</b> <b>out</b> continuously. Although as shown in Fig.  5 rising nominal and real wages may reduce some of the labor absorption caused by the expanding modern sector, as long as the productivity curve for L 2 <b>shifts</b> <b>out,</b> there will be some labor absorption by the sector. Eventually the self-reinforcing process of increasing growth, capital investment and labor employment in the modern sector will induce more workers to transfer from the rural economy to the modern sector, and the growth rate γ will increase further.|$|R
