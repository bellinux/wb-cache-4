5|$|The Kentish royal legend, {{probably}} 11th-century, {{contains the}} story of a villainous reeve of Ecgberht of Kent called Thunor, who is <b>swallowed</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> the earth at a place from then on known as þunores hlæwe (Old English 'Thunor's mound'). Gabriel Turville-Petre saw this as an invented origin for the placename demonstrating loss of memory that Thunor had been a god's name.|$|E
5|$|On 12 October 1917, the 34th Battalion—as {{a member}} of the 9th Brigade—was {{to take part in the}} 3rd Australian Division's attack on Passchendaele, Belgium. Subject to several days of heavy rain, the {{battlefield}} had been transformed into a boggy marsh on which the attack was to commence. Jeffries commanded B Company during the attack, which he halted at the entrance to Broodseinde railway cutting, as many of the direction tapes leading to the starting position had been destroyed or <b>swallowed</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> the mud. To avoid any mishaps, Jeffries and another of the battalion's company commanders, Captain T.G. Gilder, pushed on alone as far as Keerselaarhoek cemetery to find the tapes marking the battalions starting line for the attack. Thus, by 03:00 the 34th Battalion was formed up on the line of attack.|$|E
5|$|Under the Greek Ptolemaic Dynasty {{and then}} Roman rule, Greeks and Romans {{introduced}} their own deities to Egypt. These newcomers equated the Egyptian gods with their own, {{as part of}} the Greco-Roman tradition of interpretatio graeca. But the worship of the native gods was not <b>swallowed</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> that of foreign ones. Instead, Greek and Roman gods were adopted as manifestations of Egyptian ones. Egyptian cults sometimes incorporated Greek language, philosophy, iconography, and even temple architecture. Meanwhile, the cults of several Egyptian deities—particularly Isis, Osiris, Anubis, the form of Horus named Harpocrates, and the fused Greco-Egyptian god Serapis—were adopted into Roman religion and spread across the Roman Empire. Roman emperors, like Ptolemaic kings before them, invoked Isis and Serapis to endorse their authority, inside and outside Egypt. In the empire's complex mix of religious traditions, Thoth was transmuted into the legendary esoteric teacher Hermes Trismegistus, and Isis, who was venerated from Britain to Mesopotamia, became the focus of a Greek-style mystery cult. Isis and Hermes Trismegistus were both prominent in the Western esoteric tradition that grew from the Roman religious world.|$|E

5|$|By contrast, {{a massive}} crowd of {{thousands}} of Chinese soldiers and civilians from {{the south side of}} Nanking, who were fleeing in panic and disarray from the advance of Japan's 10th Army on the same night, were prevented from reaching the harbor at Xiaguan by Chinese barrier troops who fired on the crowd for retreating without permission and managed to hold it back. At 9:00 pm a fleeing Chinese tank unit, which had also not received Tang's parting message, charged the barrier troops and burst through their blockade, only for the crowd to then find that there were hardly any boats remaining in the harbor. The crowd fought to clamber aboard what few craft were available, but these soon became so overloaded that they sank midway. The rest of the Chinese soldiers took to the Yangtze's rough and frigid waters en masse while clinging to logs and pieces of scrap lumber, though most were quickly <b>swallowed</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> the river. Furthermore, by this point the Japanese encirclement of Nanking was virtually complete and many who were attempting to brave the Yangtze soon found themselves being fired upon {{from both sides of the}} river. Others who saw this turned back to the city in despair.|$|E

The original screenplay (as presented in The Curious Room) also featured an additional story being told by the huntsman, a very different final tale by Rosaleen (reminiscent of Carter's [...] "Peter and the Wolf" [...] from her collection Black Venus) and a scene set in a church with an animal congregation.|$|R

The Burmese also had plenty of boats and met the Siamese boats in kind.

In another encounter, one Siamese cannon shot scored a direct hit, killing several men on two Burmese boats.|$|E
25|$|By 1968 the {{railways}} {{had not been}} restored to profitability and Beeching's approach appeared to many to have failed.

The Ministry of Transport subsequently estimated that rail operating costs had been cut by over £100 million {{in the wake of the}} Beeching Report but that much of this had been <b>swallowed</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> increased wages. Some of the branches closed acted as feeders to the main lines, and that feeder traffic was lost when the branches closed; the financial significance of this is debatable as over 90% of {{the railways}}' 1960 traffic was carried on lines which remained open ten years later.|$|E

25|$|Startled when Pahlen's guns began bombarding his positions, Marmont {{deployed}} his own {{infantry and}} artillery on a {{rise to the}} west of Soudé and sent a note for Mortier to quickly join him. Sensing Marmont's alarm, Pahlen and Prince Adam of Württemberg chose to attack at once. Pahlen sent Dechterev's brigade around Marmont's left flank, Delivanov's brigade against the French center and Lissanovich's brigade and Illowaisky's 1,000 Cossacks north to Dommartin-Lettrée. Prince Adam and the Württemberger cavalry operated on Marmont's right flank while Nikolay Vasilyevich Kretov's Cuirassier Division and 12 guns of Markov's 23rd Horse Artillery Battery supported the center attack. Very soon the Allies had 10,000 cavalry on the field to oppose 4,934 French cavalry. This included 2,305 troopers from Johann Nepomuk von Nostitz-Rieneck's Austrian Cuirassier Division. With both his flanks turned Marmont ordered a retreat. When his cavalry under Étienne Tardif de Pommeroux de Bordesoulle moved forward it was beaten back with heavy losses. Two French light companies in Soudé were <b>swallowed</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> the Allied cavalry.|$|E
25|$|A mysterious light {{revealed}} {{the location of}} the dead boys, and a contrite Ecgberht admitted all to his court (or in the case of both Ramsey Abbey texts, discovered all from Thunor). In order to quench the family feud which this kinslaying would have provoked, Ecgberht agreed to pay a wergild for the murdered princelings. Domne Eafe wished for 48 hides of land to establish an abbey on the Isle of Thanet and suggested that the course run by her pet hind should define the bounds. The result, whether by miraculous guidance (as most texts imply), or because the hind went wherever Domne Eafe guided it, (as the Caligula A text claims) was that the requested area was marked out. During the travels of the hind, Thunor began to complain about how much land would be given up, at which point he was <b>swallowed</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> the earth, and a great mound, known as Thunures hleaw, was heaped over his burial place. Domne Eafe acquired the land from Ecgberht, and was able to establish a monastery with a Church dedicated to the Virgin Mary.|$|E
25|$|Tyndaris again bore a {{considerable}} {{part in the}} war between Sextus Pompeius and Octavian (36 BC). It {{was one of the}} points occupied and fortified by the former, when preparing for the defence of the Sicilian straits, but was taken by Agrippa after his naval victory at Mylae, and became one of his chief posts, from which he carried on offensive warfare against Pompey. Subsequently to this we hear nothing more of Tyndaris in history; but there is no doubt of its having continued to subsist throughout the period of the Roman Empire. Strabo speaks of it as one of the places on the north coast of Sicily which, in his time, still deserved the name of cities; and Pliny gives it the title of a Colonia. It is probable that it received a colony under Augustus, as we find it bearing in an inscription the titles of Colonia Augusta Tyndaritanorum. Pliny indeed mentions a great calamity which the city had sustained, when (he tells us) half of it was <b>swallowed</b> <b>up</b> <b>by</b> the sea, probably from an earthquake having caused the fall of part of the hill on which it stands, but we have no clue to the date of this event; The Itineraries attest the existence of Tyndaris, apparently still as {{a considerable}} place, in the fourth century.|$|E
