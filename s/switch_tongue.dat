However the LBSCR had refused to negotiate with the LSWR over any arrangement that would permit the operation, and declared that no Portsmouth Railway train would be allowed to pass. The LSWR decided to force the issue by running a goods train on 28 December 1858; it arrived at Havant at about 07:00 while it was still dark, with about 80 navvies on board. The LBSCR had removed the <b>switch</b> <b>tongue</b> of the Portsmouth Railway down line at the junction, so the goods train was crossed to the up line to by-pass it, but it was again stopped in Havant station by the removal of another rail section, now blocking all lines. The impasse continued until about 13:00, with LBSCR traffic being worked to the point of obstruction from either end and [...] "getting the passengers across on foot".|$|E

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I {{have examined}} bilingual families’ attitudes towards their children’s bilingualism and code switching. My research questions are {{how and when}} the informants’ children mix between their languages and if the parents have positive or negative attitudes towards their children’s language mixture. I have also asked what the bilingual families feel about bilingualism. As a method I have chosen to make qualitative interviews with my informants. Three families have been interviewed with different languages and backgrounds. The results indicate that bilingualism confers an increased interest for language and increased language awareness. Some of the informants state that their children often switch between the languages while others do not mix at all. The informants have a very positive attitude towards bilingualism {{and they do not}} see a problem in their children’s code <b>switching</b> Mother <b>tongue,</b> code <b>switching,</b> consecutive and sequential bilingualism, majority and minority languag...|$|R

During the last two decades it has been an active area of debate to whether activate the mother tongue in foreign language teaching or not. In this research it is suggested that foreign language should be supported by mother tongue teaching instead of dismissing it a priori. This article also makes the point that brief episodes of <b>switching</b> to mother <b>tongue</b> can function as a learning aid to improve the communicative competence of the foreign language learner...|$|R
40|$|UHF RFID {{technology}} is presented that can facilitate new passive assistive technologies. Tongue control for human computer interfaces is first discussed where a tag {{is attached to}} the hard palate of the mouth and the tag turn-on power is observed to vary in response to tongue proximity. Secondly, a stretchable tag is fabricated from Lycra fabric that contains conducting silver fibres. The application of strain to the elastic tag again causes the required power at the reader to activate the tag to vary in proportion. This elastic tag is proposed as a temporary skin mounted strain gauge that could detect muscle twitch in the face or neck of an otherwise physically incapacitated person. Either design might be applied to the steering function of a powered wheelchair, or to facilitate the control of a computer mouse. Better than 3 dB isolation is achieved in the <b>tongue</b> <b>switching</b> case and approximately 0. 25 dBm per percentage stretch is observed for the strain gauge...|$|R
40|$|This study {{takes a look}} at the {{acquisition}} of early bilingualism of Persian and English languages by a five year old boy named Daniel in Iran. It aims to find out the progress he has made while acquiring these languages simultaneously, degree of his success or failure in communication in each language, his code <b>switching</b> and mother <b>tongue</b> dominancy during the five year period since his birth. The result of this study shows that early bilingualism has not caused delay either in Daniel’s speech or his language acquisition process. Also it reveals that few code switching s Daniel has made are quite part of his normal language learning process and not indicative of his insufficient knowledge or his difficulty in using and communicating in either language. Moreover, it demonstrates that Daniel’s mother tongue has mostly been dominant during the period although Daniel’s mother has been communicating with him only in English which is not her first language. For this study, a descriptive method has been used based on his parents’ observations, audio and video recordings and taking notes of his bilingual communication developments since his birth. </p...|$|R

She operated the <b>switch</b> with a <b>tongue.</b> The input method was letter by letter(a type to spell a characte) communication. However, {{there were three}} problems. 1. It took time to do communication. 2. As frequency of switching conflicted, an error of switching happened. 3. The input of special characte was not finished.

The switch just used an optical fiber switchA communication aid converted the word input into a basis and a system to grind and introduced it. This system is devised to automate conversion and operation to be settled as much as possible. As a result she got possible to input a word and a sentence by frequency of a little switching than before. lt contributed to preventing fatigue of a <b>tongue</b> by her <b>switching</b> and the time that did communication being shortened.

40|$|International audienceAvalanching glacier instabilities are gravity- driven rupture {{phenomena}} that might cause majordisasters, {{especially when they}} are at the origin of a chain of processes. Reliably forecasting such eventscombined with a timely evacuation of endangered inhabited areas often constitute the most eﬃcientaction. Recently, considerable eﬀorts in monitoring, analyzing, and modeling such phenomena have led tosigniﬁcant advances in destabilization process understanding, improving early warning perspectives. Thepurpose {{of this paper is to}} review the recent progress in this domain. Three diﬀerent types of instabilitiescan be identiﬁed depending on the thermal properties of the ice/bed interface. If cold (1), the maturationof the rupture is associated with a typical time evolution of surface velocities and passive seismic activit y. Aprediction of the ﬁnal break oﬀ is possible using these precursory signs. For the two other types, water playsa key role in the development of the instability. If the ice/bed interface is partly temperate (2), the presenceof meltwater may reduce the basal resistance, which promotes the instability. No clear and easily detectableprecursory signs are known in this case, and the only way to infer any potential instability is to monitorthe temporal evolution of the thermal regime. The last type of instability (3) concerns steep temperateglacier <b>tongues</b> <b>switching</b> for several days/weeks during the melting season into a so -called “active phase”followed in rare cases by a major break-oﬀ event. Although the prediction of such events is still far frombeing achievable, critical conditions promoting the ﬁnal instability can be identiﬁed...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Applied Language and Literary Studies)) [...] Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2001 The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to investigate existing theory regarding the conceptual learning of young learners and to determine what core concepts Grade 5 learners need to learn. An empirical investigation as to whether these learners were familiar with the mother tongue words for the identified core concepts in syllabuses and textbooks, and to investigate whether they could recede these concepts into English (the medium of instruction in their classrooms) was also undertaken. The role of conceptual awareness in learning was discussed based on Piaget's, Vygotsky's and Clark's theory. They explain how concepts and knowledge are acquired and also how language affects this process. Learners are required to know the concepts of what they learn and should recede the information or concepts into the language used for a specific learning task. In the case of this study it was English. The study revealed that many learners who were investigated in this study did not possess the knowledge to encode many of the core or broader concepts in Tshivenda, their mother tongue. Learners also seemed to learn some concepts and the English encoding for them simultaneously. The findings showed, however, that most learners in Grade 5 could not recede many of the concepts that they possessed in L 1 into English the Mol. It was clear that many learners in this study were not ready to <b>switch</b> from mother <b>tongue</b> instruction to English Mol in Grade 5. Their lack of conceptual awareness coupled with the lack of adequate English proficiency to learn the subjects in English may have been influenced by a number of possible reasons. Some reasons that were suggested were the following: a lack of prior knowledge of concepts that occur in Grade 5 syllabuses and textbooks; poorly trained teachers who are unable to assist learners to create links between existing knowledge and new knowledge; poor socio-economic circumstances and illiteracy and teachers who may lack English proficiency and cannot teach all subjects confidently in English. Some implications for the findings were suggested such as the following: if teachers are aware of the demands made on the conceptual framework of learners and the possible limitations that• they have regarding their conceptual readiness to learn, intervention is possible. Much can be done regarding the strategies that teachers may employ to enrich, expand, reconstruct, revisit or adapt concepts for learning. Such strategies include visual scaffolding, an enriched conceptual and language programme and a planned and structured approach to teaching language across the curriculum. Master...|$|R
40|$|Phytochromes are photoreceptors that {{incorporate}} a bilin chromophore and undergo a photoconversion between {{a red light}} (Pr) and a far red light (Pfr) absorbing state. SynCph 2 from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 comprises the domain architecture GAF 1 -GAF 2 -GGDEF 1 *-EAL-GAF 3 -GGDEF 2, which indicates {{that it is a}} hybrid of a GAF-GAF bidomain phytochrome and a cyanobacteriochrome, represented by the GAF 3 domain. This work provides a detailed analysis of the N-terminal GAF 1 -GAF 2 module. SynCph 2 (1 - 2) retains the red/far red photochemistry of canonical phytochromes, therefore, the GAF 2 domain is able to substitute for the PHY domain in the latter. The PCB chromophore is covalently attached to Cys- 129 in the GAF 1 domain. In cooperation with the group of P. Hildebrandt we showed that all four pyrrole nitrogens are protonated in both Pr and Pfr states that comprise a ZZZssa and ZZEssa conformation, respectively. Far UV CD data reveal an increase of the α-helical content of at least 3 % in the Pr → Pfr transition which goes along with an increased hydrodynamic diameter of Pfr. We solved the crystal structure of SynCph 2 (1 - 2) in the Pr conformation at a resolution of 2. 6 Å. The protein crystallizes as an antiparallel dimer, whereby the GAF 1 domain connects to GAF 2 via a long α-helical linker. The GAF 2 domain mimics the overall organization of the PHY domain in protruding a tongue-like extension that covers the chromophore binding pocket of GAF 1. The PCB chromophore in the ZZZssa conformation is non-planar and exhibits a high tilt between the B- and C- as well as C- and D-rings. Based on the structural data we performed a mutagenesis study involving the D-ring environment, the propionate interactions of the chromophore and the tongue region. We showed that the B-ring propionate interactions differ in SynCph 2 (1 - 2) compared to canonical phytochromes and seem to vary {{depending on the type of}} effector domain. Based on the data for the amino acids in the conserved tongue motifs, we suggested a model for the structural changes during photoconversion. Here, a conformational <b>switching</b> of the <b>tongue</b> region is supposed via swap of the tryptophans from the W(G/A) G and WxE motifs that act as anchors in the Pfr structure. Upon photoconversion the Asp-Arg salt bridge between GAF 1 and the tongue is broken, the PRxSF motif is reoriented and maybe structurally reorganized to an α-helical structure establishing a new Asp-Ser interaction. We analyzed the photocycle of SynCph 2 (1 - 2) that comprises four and three intermediates in the Pr → Pfr and Pfr → Pr photoconversion, respectively. Ser- 385 of the PRxSF and Trp- 389 of the WxE motif in the tongue region are ~ 13 Å and ~ 15 Å distant from the chromophore’s D-ring, respectively, but they affect the formation of the Pfr state as S 385 A and W 389 A variants comprise an altered spectrum after red light illumination. The S 385 A mutation affects the last intermediate of the Pr → Pfr photoconversion and the first of the back reaction. The W 389 A mutation already affects the third intermediate that directly decays to a degenerated red light adapted state. The three intermediates of the back reaction to Pr all differ from SynCph 2 (1 - 2). In contrast, a phenylalanine substitution of Trp- 389 results in wild type behavior. Based on these results we concluded that during the Pr → Pfr photoconversion only the chromophore and its nearest surroundings are altered in the first two intermediates. During formation of intermediate R 2 conformational changes occur in the tongue region, involving the tryptophan-switch. Formation of the last intermediate triggers the movement of Ser- 385 and the formation of the hydrogen bond network involving the aspartate of GAF 1 and Ser- 385. In a work performed with P. Savakis, S. De Causmaecker and V. Angerer and in cooperation with the group of A. Wilde we illuminated the role of the C-terminal GAF 3 -GGDEF 2 module. SynCph 2 (5 - 6) comprises a photoconversion between a blue (Pb) and green light absorbing (Pg) state. It covalently attaches PCB to Cys- 1022 and to Cys- 994 and is able to isomerize the chromophore to PVB. The module can produce c-di-GMP in the GGDEF 2 domain in a light dependent manner with Pg as the signaling state. In vivo studies in Synechocystis sp. confirmed these observations. Under blue light conditions the c-di-GMP production of SynCph 2 (5 - 6) leads to an inhibition of phototaxis. Nevertheless, only a coproduction of SynCph 2 (5 - 6) with SynCph 2 (1 - 4) can restore the wild type phenotype under white light thus proving the enzymatic activity of SynCph 2 (1 - 4) that is mediated by the EAL domain in degrading c-di-GMP. Overall, the here presented studies on SynCph 2 show the interplay between the photochemical and structural properties in the Pr / Pfr and Pb / Pg interconverting modules as well as their implications in vivo. Future studies will benefit from the enhanced knowledge about intramolecular signaling in phytochromes including the tryptophan switch hypothesis...|$|R
