40|$|In {{recent years}} {{libraries}} enhanced their offer from books to materials like videos, music cassettes {{and most important}} CDs and DVDs. These items are quite expensive to buy and therefore have a high demand by the library users. Many libraries also try to offer some kind of social meeting point and incorporate a café or an attractive reading room. This all contributes to the positive new image of libraries. The extension of the collection and the increased demand lead to an increased amount of work and requires more staff. However, {{it is difficult to}} get additional budget for continuous costs. It is easier to do one-time investments in order to shift the repetitive work away from the desk and to automatic <b>self</b> <b>service</b> <b>stations.</b> Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is an established technology (since 2001) to take over the repetitive tasks: check out, return of items, sorting and inventory control. RFID-Systems have a maximum effect if there is also a good room planning which supports their function and the frequency of their use (Kern, 2002, 2004; Wampfler, 2003). In this paper two approaches for the allocation of functional units in a library are compared: · the traditional central allocation of the functional units at the counter (used by the staff); · the decentral allocation of functional units, used by the library visitor. After this theoretical view some practical recommendations for the library and the architectural planner are given. These are derived from experiences of RFID installations in over 20 libraries (Bibliotheca RFID Library Systems AG) ...|$|R

Today, few stations advertise or provide full <b>service.</b> Full <b>service</b> <b>stations</b> are more common in wealthy and upscale areas. The cost of full service is usually assessed as a fixed amount per U.S.gallon.|$|R

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of <b>self</b> <b>service</b> technologies {{has changed the}} way customers interact with service employees and technology. More consumers are now valuing the convenience, consistency, and the control they have over the <b>self</b> <b>service</b> technologies. However, despite {{the growing popularity of}} these technologies, hotel industries in Singapore have not embraced <b>self</b> <b>service</b> technologies in their day to day operations. <b>Self</b> <b>service</b> technologies present opportunities for hotels to improve on service standards, and the wide variety of technology applications available allow hotels to choose an application that suits the customers and the hotels needs. To enable hotels to seamlessly adopt <b>self</b> <b>service</b> technologies in the servicescape, this paper proposes a conceptual framework that systematically guides hoteliers through the decision process of implementing <b>self</b> <b>service</b> technologies...|$|R

As a result, a lot of firms are developing innovative <b>self</b> <b>service</b> technologies with hope that their customers are satisfied. In order for a <b>self</b> <b>service</b> technology to succeed in making customers happy, companies must learn and know what drives customer satisfaction. This paper examines what a firm should consider {{in order to encourage}} customers to at least try, and eventually adopt, the <b>self</b> <b>service</b> technology offered by a firm into the customer's regular routine. Factors that encourage the customer to try a new self-service technology {{for the first time and}} factors impact customer satisfaction and dissatisfaction will be addressed. <b>self</b> <b>service</b> technologies, customer value, customer satisfaction...|$|R

The study draws on the diffusion model which involves employees' perceptions of five key attributes of innovations namely, Relative Advantage, Compatibility, Complexity, Trialability, and Observability, to determine their relative influences on the rates of adoption and or non-adoption of the Employee <b>Self</b> <b>Service.</b> The results of the study demonstrate the relevance and usefulness of determining which attributes of innovations are perceived to be the most important, as informing a strategy for the successful introduction of the Employee <b>Self</b> <b>Service</b> as an e-government initiative.

40|$|We {{conduct a}} field study on a {{prominent}} US health insurance firm {{to examine the}} cost saving rationale for deploying <b>self</b> <b>service</b> at the call centers. In our setting, firm introduced web self-service portal for its members to contain large telephone handling cost at its call center. Management Practitioners claim that per interaction cost of web based <b>self</b> <b>service</b> channel is {{an order of magnitude}} cheaper than the assisted channels of customer service like telephony. However, they do not account for the impact of web based <b>self</b> <b>service</b> usage on the demand for other assisted channels. Surprisingly, the net effect of web based <b>self</b> <b>service</b> on other assisted channels of customer service has not been empirically validated so far. Drawing from the vertical differentiation literature in economics and human information acquisition and processing theories from psychology, we present a theoretical framework to show that both possibilities may exist (1) the web based self-service substitutes the assisted channels and (2) web based self-service leads to increase in demand for assisted channel. In our field setting, we show through a robust diff-in-diff specification that web based <b>self</b> <b>service</b> usage leads to 23 % increase in telephony usage. We also use instrumental variables to account for potential selection of customers into the <b>self</b> <b>service</b> usage. Our results inform practicing managers on many counts (1) although cheaper on per interaction level, web based self-service may not be necessarily cheaper overall (2) Need for integrated management in multichannel customer service setup e. g. web based <b>self</b> <b>service</b> should have an option for escalating the query to other assisted channels (3) <b>Self</b> <b>services</b> should not be seen only as a mean for reducing operational cost, as it provides wider options to customers that may lead to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty...|$|R
