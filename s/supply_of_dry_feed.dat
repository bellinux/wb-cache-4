The level of oxygen saturation ranged between 85 and 105  % and pH was kept stable at 7.8. For the purpose of the study, several performance factors were evaluated as follows. The number of the weaned larvae per tank; the final survival expressed as the percentage of the initial stocking of the tank (based on the daily collection of the dead larvae/fry), as well as the percentages of: (1) the mortality (from the beginning of the weaning phase to fry sales); (2) the fry without swim bladder at a mean weight of 0.5 – 1.0  g which were rejected from the tanks and counted after buoyancy testing (i.e. these individuals sink to the bottom during a salinity increase from 35 – 36 to 58 – 60  ppt, after anaesthetized with 2 -phenoxy-ethanol); (3) the fry with skeletal deformities which were also rejected by hand, following optical observation and counted during the previous buoyancy test; and (4) the total fry losses after weaning. The type of the skeletal deformities observed in this study were the lack of or the existence of atrophic operculum, snout/mouth dysplasia, lack of dorsal fin and hypoplasia of the caudal fin, with the last two of them being of significant commercial importance (Chatain and Corrao 1992; Morretti et al. 1999).

40|$|The goats {{raised in}} the barn are usually fed on fresh grass. As dry forage can be stored for long periods in large amounts, <b>dry</b> forage <b>feeding</b> makes it {{possible}} to feed large numbers of goats in barns. This review explains the physiological factors involved in suppressing dry forage intake and the cause <b>of</b> drinking following <b>dry</b> forage <b>feeding.</b> Ruminants consume an enormous amount <b>of</b> <b>dry</b> forage in a short time. Eating rates <b>of</b> <b>dry</b> forage rapidly decreased in the first 40 min of feeding and subsequently declined gradually to low states in the remaining time of the feeding period. Saliva in large-type goats is secreted in large volume during the first hour after the commencement <b>of</b> <b>dry</b> forage <b>feeding.</b> It was elucidated that the marked suppression <b>of</b> <b>dry</b> forage intake during the first hour was caused by a feeding-induced hypovolemia and the loss of NaHCO 3 due to excessive salivation during the initial stages <b>of</b> <b>dry</b> forage <b>feeding.</b> On the other hand, it was indicated that the marked decrease in feed intake observed in the second hour of the 2 h feeding period was related to ruminal distension caused by the feed consumed and the copious amount of saliva secreted during <b>dry</b> forage <b>feeding.</b> In addition, results indicate that the marked decreases in dry forage intake after 40 min of feeding are caused by increases in plasma osmolality and subsequent thirst sensations produced by <b>dry</b> forage <b>feeding.</b> After 40 min of the 2 h <b>dry</b> forage <b>feeding</b> period, the feed salt content is absorbed into the rumen and plasma osmolality increases. The combined effects of ruminal distension and increased plasma osmolality accounted for 77. 6 % of the suppression <b>of</b> <b>dry</b> forage intake 40 min after the start <b>of</b> <b>dry</b> forage <b>feeding.</b> The results indicate that ruminal distension and increased plasma osmolality are the main physiological factors in suppression <b>of</b> <b>dry</b> forage intake in large-type goats. There was very little drinking behavior observed during the first hour of the 2 h feeding period most water consumption occurring in the second hour. The cause of this thirst sensation during the second hour <b>of</b> <b>dry</b> forage <b>feeding</b> period was not hypovolemia brought about by excessive salivation, but rather increases in plasma osmolality due to the ruminal absorption of salt from the consumed feed. This suggests the water intake following <b>dry</b> forage <b>feeding</b> is determined by the level of salt content in the feed...|$|R
40|$|Water {{makes up}} 85. 8 % {{of the body}} weight (BW) of a {{neonatal}} calf (Lewis and Phillips, 1978). Prior to birth, the developing fetus is surrounded by amniotic fluid that is 92 % water. In the uterus, the developing calf is supplied with water by diffusion from maternal plasma, and at birth, the calf is at its greatest water content having developed in a water based media where water has borne the nutrients required to allow rapid growth and development. The uterus supplies an environment where water containing fluids shelter the fetus, mitigating the effects of jolting and gravity on the developing fetus. Upon birth, the mammal is suddenly exposed to light, temperature extremes, and wind, beginning the processes <b>of</b> <b>drying</b> and dependence on water contained in milk and the intake of free water by the calf. While milk is {{the primary source of}} water for the calf, consumption of additional free water is required to support optimal growth and health in the bovine. Feeding supplemental water to pre-weaned calves is of particular importance to encourage consumption <b>of</b> <b>dry</b> <b>feed.</b> Kertz et al. (1984) demonstrated that when supplemental water was not provided, this resulted in a 31 % decrease in dry matter (DM) intake and a 38 % reduction in weight gain.

The Watson SPX 100 pumps the grout through approximately 1500 feet of piping prior to being discharged into the Saltstone Disposal Facility (SDF) vaults. The existing grout hopper has been identified by the Saltstone Enhanced Low Activity Waste Disposal (ELAWD) project for re-design.

The larger volume hopper is designed to handle variability in the output of the READCO mixer and process upsets without entering set back during processing. The objectives of this task involve scaling the proposed hopper design and testing the scaled hopper for the following processing issues: (1) The effect of agitation on radar measurement. Formation of a vortex may affect the ability to accurately measure the tank level. The agitator was run at varying speeds and with varying grout viscosities to determine what parameters cause vortex formation and whether measurement accuracy is affected.
