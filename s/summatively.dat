40|$|This article reviews how {{practical}} work, including practical skills, {{is currently}} <b>summatively</b> assessed in school science {{in a number}} of countries and makes comparisons with how other subjects, such as music and geography, <b>summatively</b> assess skills. Whilst practical skills in school science are clearly valued as being of importance, {{there is a lack of}} clarity as to what these skills actually are and how they might, most effectively, be validly assessed. Countries vary greatly in the extent to which they employ what we term ‘Direct Assessment of Practical Skills’ (DAPS) or ‘Indirect Assessment of Practical Skills’ (IAPS). Each of these approaches has advantages and disadvantages but we conclude that too great a reliance on IAPS reduces the likelihood that practical work will be taught and learnt as well as it might be...|$|E

Formative assessment can improve {{teaching and learning}} by using evidence of student understanding to adapt instruction.

40|$|The need to {{determine}} the directionality of interactions between neural signals is a key requirement for analysis of multichannel recordings. Approaches most commonly used are parametric, typically relying on autoregressive models. A number of concerns have been expressed regarding parametric approaches, thus {{there is a need}} to consider alternatives. We present an alternative nonparametric approach for construction of directionality measures for bivariate random processes. The method combines time and frequency domain representations of bivariate data to decompose the correlation by direction. Our framework generates two sets of complementary measures, a set of scalar measures, which decompose the total product moment correlation coefficient <b>summatively</b> into three terms by direction and a set of functions which decompose the coherence <b>summatively</b> at each frequency into three terms by direction: forward direction, reverse direction and instantaneous interaction. It can be undertaken as an addition to a standard bivariate spectral and coherence analysis, and applied to either time series or point-process (spike train) data or mixtures of the two (hybrid data). In this paper, we demonstrate application to spike train data using simulated cortical neurone networks and application to experimental data from isolated muscle spindle sensory endings subject to random efferent stimulation...|$|E

40|$|The {{view that}} the {{adoption}} of certain managerialist procedures and practices (such as performance management or performance-related pay) will inevitably lead to performance improvement has had {{an enormous impact on}} the state maintained sector. This study, which uses mixed methods, examines the complex and contested relationship between managerialism, teacher culture and teacher performance review in state and independent schools. Schools in the independent sector are not under any statutory compulsion to implement a particular model of performance review — for example performance management — {{in the same way as}} state maintained schools. Evidence from case studies (supported by national survey data) suggests that the predominant discourse in state schools is one of managerialism. Teacher cultures can be described as being generally improving and learning in nature. Performance review schemes have moved from being less managerialist, richly contextualised, and <b>summatively</b> reassuring to being explicitly managerialist, less contextualised, normative and developmental following the introduction of statutory performance management in 2000. In contrast, the predominant discourse in independent schools is one of anti-managerialism or, to a certain extent, amanagerialism with little engagement with managerialist notions of teacher culture. Because of the prevailing anti-managerialism, performance review schemes are largely ineffective, the schemes' main function being to <b>summatively</b> reassure teachers that they are doing a good job...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{ability to}} infer network {{structure}} from multivariate neuronal signals {{is central to}} computational neuroscience. Directed network analyses typically use parametric approaches based on auto-regressive (AR) models, where networks are constructed from estimates of AR model parameters. However, the validity of using low order AR models for neurophysiological signals has been questioned. A recent article introduced a non parametric approach to estimate directionality in bivariate data, non parametric approaches are free from concerns over model validity. NEW METHOD: We extend the non parametric framework to include measures of directed conditional independence, using scalar measures that decompose the overall partial correlation coefficient <b>summatively</b> by direction, {{and a set of}} functions that decompose the partial coherence <b>summatively</b> by direction. A time domain partial correlation function allows both time and frequency views of the data to be constructed. The conditional independence estimates are conditioned on a single predictor. RESULTS: The framework is applied to simulated cortical neuron networks and mixtures of Gaussian time series data with known interactions. It is applied to experimental data consisting of local field potential recordings from bilateral hippocampus in anaesthetised rats. COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S) :. The framework offers a non parametric approach to estimation of directed interactions in multivariate neuronal recordings, and increased flexibility in dealing with both spike train and time series data. CONCLUSIONS: The framework offers a novel alternative non parametric approach to estimate directed interactions in multivariate neuronal recordings, and is applicable to spike train and time series data...|$|E

40|$|Paramedic {{programs}} present significant {{challenges in}} developing and assessing clinical performance. The Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) is typically used <b>summatively</b> to measure acquisition of clinical skills, declarative knowledge and scene control. To our knowledge formative use of the OSCE within paramedic science has not been reported in academic literature. A pilot research project undertaken at the University of the Sunshine Coast (USC) {{examined the effects of}} introducing formative OSCE assessment on students‘ attainment of clinical skills and on their ability to critically reflect on their own practice and that of their peers. The project changed the OSCE from a stand-alone summative assessment to include formative strategies embedded in the curriculum. These included the deconstruction and analysis of the OSCE assessment criteria prior to the task, peer and self-assessment on formative OSCE opportunities and students‘ critical reflection on a video recording of their individual OSCE. These meta-cognitive activities were designed to encourage greater student understanding of and engagement with identifying and self-correcting skills that were to be <b>summatively</b> assessed. The project used mixed methods to study the efficacy of formative assessment by developing OSCEs for learning and as learning (Earl, 2003) {{as well as for the}} traditional assessment of learning. Data collection was via self-administered online questionnaire, focus group interviews, and correlating self, peer and tutor assessment. The preliminary results indicate that students perceive the inclusion of a number of formative assessment strategies improved their engagement with the course learning outcomes and understanding of the OSCE assessment, required deeper understanding of clinical skills and developed desired attributes of paramedic practitioners through a focus on active assessment and learning. The outcomes of this study will add to the development of an evidence-based framework for teaching and assessing clinical competencies with paramedic students across Australia and the development of a signature pedagogy for paramedic education...|$|E

40|$|Traditional {{approaches}} to assessing undergraduate assignments {{in the field}} of software related courses, including Analytics and Data Science courses, involve the course tutors in reading the students’ code and getting the students to physically demonstrate their artefacts.

40|$|Service-learning is a {{pedagogy}} {{that combines}} academic study with {{service to the}} community. Voluntary work placements are integral to service-learning and offer students an ideal opportunity to develop their employability skills and attributes. In a service-learning course, it was considered good practice to raise students’ awareness {{of the development of}} these skills and attributes. To enable this, the assessment in the course was adapted accordingly, and thus an innovative, <b>summatively</b> co-assessed oral presentation was introduced. This study investigates the effects of using this type of assessment, in which students were required to give an oral presentation of their critical reflections on the employability skills and attributes they had developed during the course.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{comprised}} of a comprehensive literature review focused on identifying factors that protect children from early adversity and a proposed intervention and accompanying program evaluation intended to improve health outcomes for traumatized children.

40|$|The {{conclusion}} of this special issue on Social Return On Investment (SROI) begins with a summary of both advantages and problems of SROI, {{many of which were}} identified in preceding articles. We also offer potential solutions for some of these problems that can be derived from standard evaluation practices and that are becoming expected in SROIs that follow guidances from international SROI networks. A remaining concern about SROI is that we do not yet know if SROI itself adds sufficient benefit to programs to justify its cost. Two frameworks for this proposed metaevaluation of SROI are suggested, the first comparing benefits to costs <b>summatively</b> (the resource!outcome model). The second framework evaluates costs and benefits according to how much they contribute to or are caused by the different activities of SROI. This resource!activity!outcome model could enable outcomes of SROI to be maximized within resource constraints (such as budget and time limits) on SROI. Alternatively, information from this model could help minimize the costs of achieving a specific level of return on investment from conducting SROI. Possible problems with this metaevaluation of SROI are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Pre-sessional EAP {{courses in}} the UK fulfil a {{difficult}} dual role. Not only are they charged with helping students learn the academic language and literacy skills they will require on their degree courses, {{but they are also}} expected to <b>summatively</b> assess those skills in order to decide on the readiness of students to begin English medium degree study. This creates tension between assessment and learning. Students are often extrinsically motivated by the need for a passing grade rather than focussing on the learning gains they make throughout the course. For this reason {{it is important that the}} approach to assessment on pre-sessional courses actually supports learning. This paper outlines the approach taken to the assessment of academic writing on the PEAP course at Nottingham Trent University. It describes how the assessment was redesigned to emphasise process over end product and to maximise early and sustained student engagement. This was achieved by careful scaffolding of the writing process, the strategic use of summative elements of the assessment, and an emphasis on formative feedback, reflection, and understanding of the assessment criteria. The paper considers how this approach to assessment is supporting student learning but also points out some ongoing concerns...|$|E

Place and Duration of Study: School of Medicine, University of Glasgow, UK, from February to July 2011. Methodology: Used a constructivist approach, a purposive sampling technique was applied to interview those faculty members who {{were associated with the}} assessment of professionalism. A total of eight faculty members were interviewed, and the data was analysed thematically. Results: The learning outcomes are assessed in both formative and summative examinations but the focus is mainly on formative assessments. Both objective and subjective assessment instruments are used, although qualitative assessment instruments evaluate the topic with greater validity. Some of the assessment instruments are used formatively as well as <b>summatively.</b> Conclusion: The assessment of professionalism is a multidimensional activity. Both formative and summative assessments together with an 'assessment for learning' strategy can be used with great effect. Here the role of formative assessment and 'assessment for learning' are more significant as they are a continuous process and their frequency and feedback will make a profound impression on students...|$|E

It explores student reception of this approach and maps Zotero’s capacities to represent citations to learning outcomes and information literacy frames that instruction librarians assess. Design/methodology/approach – The librarian worked with a course using Zotero group libraries for collaborative work, used Zotero to communicate with students and assess their information literacy skills and surveyed the students to determine their perception of librarian participation via Zotero. Findings – Using Zotero’s features {{made it possible to}} formatively and <b>summatively</b> assess student work quickly, and students were receptive to librarian participation via Zotero. Practical implications – This suggests that librarians facing difficulty embedding in online courses or those seeking to assess student work may wish to explore Zotero as a sustainable solution to both challenges.

The examination component of students’ semester result is no doubt summative assessment in orientation and practice. Over the years, the CA also has only been assessed <b>summatively</b> although it could be both summative and formative, which is diagnostic assessment. This paper investigates the awareness of the lecturers of the UOE about diagnostic assessment, whether they engage it and if not, why not through a set of questionnaire administered on some lecturers. The questionnaires were analyzed by obtaining the Mean, Variance and Consistence Index for each response as well as its standard deviation. Results obtained reveal that most lecturers are not aware that CA could be diagnostic consequently; they do not engage it whereas doing so would increase their students ’ motivation and thus enhance their performance. Hence, the paper recommends among others the creation of the awareness of diagnostic assessment among lecturers. ...|$|E

The knowledge requirements for year 6 distinguish between the use of the singular “a strategy ” for the lowest grade and the plural “strategies ” for the higher grades. Although there are strong arguments in favour of including strategies in a language syllabus, teachers face several problems when assessing strategies <b>summatively</b> as a basis for grading, particularly listening and reading strategies. First, there is a problem of categorization and definition. Second, if listening and reading strategies are viewed metacognitively, they cannot be assessed when being used. Third, strategies may be used consciously or subconsciously. Fourth, the knowledge requirements indicate that teachers should establish a causal relationship between strategy use and comprehension, but strategies are not necessarily facilitative and learners ’ successful comprehension may be due to other factors. While arguing that reception strategies should not have been included in the knowledge requirements, the text includes an example of how a teacher had her learners using listening strategies collaboratively and as a basis for formative assessment...|$|E

METHOD: Videotapes of 10 trainees carrying out normal consultations were assessed by 20 assessors for acceptable competence using a rating scale specifically developed for the purpose. RESULTS: A principal components analysis showed a strong correlation among the items in the rating scale used, indicating that a single underlying factor accounted for 76 % of the overall scores. Agreement between assessors on the scoring of individual consultations was limited. There was much greater consistency with regard to the decision on overall competence, examined for the first consultation. A non-competent trainee would have a 95 % probability of being identified by the process as described using two assessors for each videotape. The assessors had reached firm judgements on each trainee by the time four consultations had been viewed. CONCLUSION: The workload involved in producing and analysing the tapes is discussed. Considerations of patient consent are addressed. It is concluded that the use of videotaped consultations appears to offer a feasible and reliable method of summative assessment of general practitioner trainees...|$|E

The increase in the susceptible population and improved diagnostics <b>summatively</b> contributed to this. In clinical grounds, differentiation of pyogenic and tuberculous spondylodiscitis is well defined. Enterobacter agglomerans is a hospital contaminant and associated with infections in immunocompromised individuals and intravenous lines. It causes {{a wide array of}} infections. Enterobacter agglomerans spondylodiscitis is unusual and there are, around the globe, only less than 31 suspected cases that have been previously reported. Enterobacter agglomerans histology mimics tuberculous rather than pyogenic spondylodiscitis. A 65 -year-old farming lady, while being in hospital, developed sudden onset spastic paraparesis with hyperreflexia. Later blood culture revealed Enterobacter agglomerans with 41 -hour incubation in 99. 9 % probability from Ramel identification system. Her initial ESR was 120 [*]mm/first hour. Isolate was susceptible to ciprofloxacin and intravenous followed with oral therapy shows a drastic ESR fall and improved clinical response. Differentiation of tuberculous and pyogenic spondylodiscitis is very much important in management point of view. Therefore, blood culture has a role in diagnosis of spondylodiscitis.

To this end, we have administered frequent CBA, incorporating extensive feedback, both to pace the students' study efforts and to pinpoint areas in which additional help from lecturers may be required. Three of the 7 CBA provided through the 15 -week course were initially given as open-book summative tests, thus contributing to the overall mark for the module. Other CBA were formative: these included repeats of the summative CBA made available for revision purposes, as well as other CBA which focused mainly on aspects of the course that were <b>summatively</b> assessed by other means. A closedbook final exam, also computer-based, was given in the final week as a comprehensive assessment. We have evaluated the utility and effectiveness of our approach by surveying student opinion via questionnaires, examining patterns and extent of student use of formative assessments, and by analysing grades for the summative CBA.
