5|$|At {{the start}} of the First World War, Phillips enlisted in the 20th (Service) Battalion Royal Fusiliers, and after refusing a commission, served as a Sergeant. The 20th Royal Fusiliers was one of four battalions of the {{regiment}} raised in 1914 by the Public Schools and University Men’s Force. Phillips was deployed to France with his unit on 16 November 1915.

5|$|Bolander (Ned Beatty) and Munch (Richard Belzer) {{investigate}} a double shooting {{in which a}} drug dealer was killed and another man was badly injured. During the investigation they find a high-class prostitute hiding in a nearby doghouse. After making unsuccessful advances on Bolander, she admits the drug dealer was killed by his own bodyguard, Newton Stuart (Richard Pelzman). After arresting him, Stuart says the other shooting victim used the drug dealer as a human shield. In a misguided attempt to follow his employer's orders to kill anyone who threatens him, Stuart said he <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> drug dealer to ensure the man threatening him would also be shot.|$|E
50|$|On April 10, 1949 Morrison {{was arrested}} after he {{allegedly}} fired four <b>shots</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> door and window of Sheps Bar and Grill, 303 W. 146th St. It {{has not been}} established at whom he was shooting.|$|R

50|$|The Damned (Les Maudits) is a 1947 French drama film {{directed}} by René Clément. It was {{entered into the}} 1947 Cannes Film Festival. The film is notable for its depiction of {{the interior of a}} wartime submarine and for its tracking <b>shots</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> length of the U-boat.|$|R
5|$|In March 1916, Phillipps was {{deployed}} to France with the 28th Battalion for {{service on the}} Western Front. He participated in a raid against the forts of Armentières {{on the night of}} 6/7June, and saw action during the Battle of Pozières in July. On 5August, he was <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> thigh, requiring evacuation to England for hospital treatment. He was promoted to captain on 12August. Phillipps rejoined his unit in October but suffered another gunshot wound to the thigh the following month, near Gueudecourt. He returned to England once more to recover, and remained in hospital until 2March 1917.|$|E
5|$|In Worcester, Massachusetts, Carlton Chase {{runs from}} an unknown assailant, makes a brief phone call, and then runs {{to a police}} station. After a {{skirmish}} with the guards, he is placed in a large room with cinder blocks for walls and a solid steel door. He screams at the officer that he still is not safe. Suddenly, and mysteriously, he is shot from inside the room. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) are informed that Chase was killed with an armor-piercing round, which appears to have entered the room through the air vent in the ceiling. Upon further investigation, the agents discover that the assassin <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> roof, ceiling and ductwork, and into the victim.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenants Nuge and Klaus, {{the other}} two Yellow Jacket {{commanding}} officers, were also soon shot and killed. The Yellow Jackets began to fall back from the main line, retreating with the sentinels. The warriors followed the retreating unit and entered the camp. Colonel Bartholomew requested a detachment of 25 regular troops and led a bayonet charge that repulsed the warriors. During the charge Bartholomew was <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> lower arm, breaking both bones. He was still clutching his sword when he was treated hours later. For his leadership during the Battle of Tippecanoe, Bartholomew was promoted to brigadier general.|$|E

Sipido missed everyone inside and was quickly wrestled to the ground.|$|R
60|$|He {{pulled a}} six-shooter from his coat as he spoke, and fired all <b>the</b> <b>shots</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> {{body of the}} {{prisoner}}. The room was so filled with smoke that we could see nothing, but when it cleared the prisoner was still standing there, looking down in disgust {{at the front of}} his coat.|$|R
5|$|On 17 November, the RhAR was {{withdrawn}} {{for a period}} of rest and recuperation (R). The battalion's Transport Platoon was ambushed by communist guerrillas as it was returning to base: a <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> windscreen of one of the two trucks nearly hit its driver, but the convoy was able to escape the ambush without anybody being injured. On 26 November, the RhAR and the King's Own Scottish Borderers assisted the local police at Kelapa Sawit in an action called Tartan Rock: the security forces moved into the village and arrested 34 communist sympathisers, most of whom were ethnic Chinese students from the University of Malaya in Singapore. Two days later, the RhAR were back on regular duty.|$|E
5|$|Rain started falling {{again and}} heavy fog {{closed in on}} the {{mountain}} top and severely reduced visibility there. Again the North Koreans attacked the 2nd Platoon and the adjacent E Company infantrymen. One of the engineers was <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> neck and Vandygriff {{sent him to the}} company command post, only to have the man return to report that there was no longer a command post, that he could not find anyone and had seen only North Korean dead. Vandygriff now went to the noncommissioned officer who was in command of the E Company platoon and inform him. The two decided to withdraw.|$|E
5|$|Strupper {{scored the}} second {{touchdown}} {{on a short}} drive set up by his 40-yard punt return. Early in the second quarter, Strupper <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> line for 70 yards and the third touchdown. Tech's fourth touchdown required considerable effort and a methodical drive, ending in a 15-yard dive for a touchdown by Strupper. End runs by Guyon and Simpson's line plunging set up the fifth (and final) touchdown with Guyon's 6-yard run. Strupper ran for 198 {{yards and three touchdowns}} on nine carries. Tech's starting lineup was Bell (left end), Fincher (left tackle), Thweatt (left guard), Phillips (center), Dowling (right guard), Rogers (right tackle), Carpenter (right end), Hill (quarterback), Strupper (left halfback), Guyon (right halfback), and Armsley (fullback).|$|E

5|$|Texian {{survivors}} of the Battle of Coleto Creek believed their surrender agreement with Urrea would, at worst, mean their deportation. Santa Anna, however, adhered to the 1835 Tornel Decree that stated the insurrection {{was an act of}} piracy fomented by the United States, and ordered their executions. Although he personally disagreed with the need to do so, Urrea carried out his commander's orders on March 27. Of the estimated 370 Texians being held, a few managed to escape the massacre. The remainder were shot, stabbed with bayonets and lances and clubbed with gun butts. Fannin was <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> face and his gold watch stolen. The dead were cremated on a pyre.|$|E
5|$|The rain when Jenny and Lindsay's car {{breaks down}} was added {{digitally}} in post-production. The filmmakers {{had not been}} granted permission to film at the roadside location, but went ahead against the authorities' wishes as Six felt the location in the woods was ideal for the scene. When Heiter's window is repaired after Lindsay's escape attempt, {{the use of a}} tracking <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> window pane required the reflection of the crew to be digitally removed from the glass. The film contains a large number of long tracking shots; Six has cited the influence of Takashi Miike who also uses many tracking shots in his films.|$|E
5|$|Accounts differ as to {{the cause}} of death; one version stated that he died by poison only and another view claimed he died by a self-inflicted gunshot while biting down on a cyanide capsule. Contemporary historians have {{rejected}} these accounts as being either Soviet propaganda or an attempted compromise in order to reconcile the different conclusions. One eyewitness stated that Hitler's corpse showed signs of having been <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> mouth, but this has been proven unlikely. There is also controversy regarding the authenticity of skull and jaw fragments that were recovered. In 2009, American researchers performed DNA tests on a skull that Soviet officials had long believed to be that of Hitler. The tests and examination revealed that the skull was actually that of a woman less than 40 years old. The recovered jaw fragments were not tested.|$|E
5000|$|The film bears {{resemblance}} to its close contemporary, the All Quiet on the Western Front (1930), an American production, {{although it has}} a bleaker tone consistent with Pabst's New Objectivity work <b>through</b> <b>the</b> late 1920s. It was particularly pioneering in its early use of sound—it was Pabst's first [...] "talkie"—in that Pabst managed to record live audio during complex tracking <b>shots</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> trenches.|$|R
50|$|In 1974, at Hull, Johnson {{played in}} a memorable match against Yorkshire. In 1980 in his autobiography, Time to Declare, D'Oliveira recounted a humorous anecdote. Johnson scored a useful 27 runs to help D'Oliveira to 227, his highest score in {{first-class}} cricket. Richard Hutton, grew increasingly frustrated with Johnson. Johnson made streaky <b>shots</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> slips and gully area off Hutton's medium-pace bowling.|$|R
50|$|Pitted against Royce, Hackney {{managed to}} resist some initial takedowns, even getting a clean sprawl in an instance, and landed {{multiple}} <b>shots</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> attempts. After exchanging knees, Gracie pulled guard and attempted a triangle choke, only for Hackney {{to stand and}} land a right hand which marked Royce's face. At the end, however, Royce got the armbar and made him tap out.|$|R
5|$|At age 76, Librescu {{was among}} the 32 people who were murdered in the Virginia Tech shooting. On April 16, 2007, Seung-Hui Cho entered the Norris Hall Engineering Building and opened fire on classrooms. Librescu, who taught a solid {{mechanics}} class in Room 204 in the Norris Hall during April 2007, held {{the door of his}} classroom shut while the gunman attempted to enter it. Although he was <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> door, Librescu managed to prevent the gunman from entering the classroom until most of his students had escaped through the windows. He was struck by five bullets, with a shot to the head proving to be fatal. Of the 23 registered students in his class, only one, Minal Panchal, died.|$|E
5|$|Contradicting {{the noon}} and 3pm timelines, Mohammed Tawil, {{the doctor who}} {{admitted}} Muhammad to the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, told Esther Schapira that the boy had been admitted around 10:00am local time, along with the ambulance driver, who had been <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> heart. Tawil later {{said that he could}} not recall what he had told reporters about this. Records from the Al-Shifa Hospital reportedly show that a young boy was examined in the pathology department at midday. The pathologist, Dr.Abed El-Razeq El Masry, examined him for half an hour. He told Schapira that the boy's abdominal organs were lying outside his body, and he showed Schapira , with a card identifying the boy as Muhammad. A watch on a pathologist's wrist in one of the images appeared to say 3:50.|$|E
5|$|Ike Clanton, who {{had been}} {{threatening}} to kill the Earps for several months, including the day before, and Billy Claiborne were both unarmed. They ran from the fight unhurt. Wesley Fuller, a Cowboy {{who had been}} {{at the rear of the}} lot, left as soon as the firing began. Both Wyatt and Virgil believed Tom McLaury was armed and testified that he had fired at least one shot over the back of a horse. Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury exchanged gunfire with the lawmen. During the gunfight, Doc Holliday was bruised by a bullet fired by Frank that struck his holster and grazed his hip. Virgil Earp was <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> calf, he thought by Billy Clanton. Morgan Earp was struck across both shoulder blades by a bullet that Morgan thought Frank McLaury had fired. Wyatt Earp was unhurt. Tom McLaury, his brother Frank, and Billy Clanton were killed.|$|E

5|$|In the north, 1 RAR was {{inserted}} into its new landing zone—LZ March— to the south-west. With B Company securing the site, the battalion moved on {{foot to the}} line of departure but not before they were mistakenly engaged by US helicopter gunships and artillery fire. However, after the Australians established communications, the shelling was halted and they began their advance. No sooner had the lead elements—D Company under the command of Major Ian Fisher—emerged into the cleared area that was originally to have been used as the battalion's LZ, when the forward platoon came under fire from Viet Cong positions in the tree-line on the north-east corner. In the action which followed, six Australians from 12 Platoon were wounded, including platoon commander Lieutenant Jim Bourke, who was <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> jaw but remained in command until he passed out from loss of blood. Meanwhile, two medics who attempted to move forward to treat the casualties were themselves shot and killed.|$|E
5|$|She was of one several Chinese ships {{caught in}} the harbour of Weihaiwei when the Japanese laid siege over the winter in early 1895 in the Battle of Weihaiwei. Huang refused to leave Jiyuan to seek {{treatment}} for injuries sustained during the battle; instead his wounds were dressed and he continued in his duties. He was then <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> thigh, and continued to refuse treatment. A few minutes later {{he was killed by}} an explosive shell fired by a Japanese vessel. Admiral Ding Ruchang, in command of the fleet, surrendered on 12 February, and committing suicide shortly afterwards. In exchange for the surrender of all war material including the fleet, good behaviour was promised by the Japanese. Jiyuan was later commissioned into the Imperial Japanese Navy as Saien, the same Chinese character name.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of the Second Boer War, Biggs volunteered for active service and was posted as a private to the Glamorgan Yeomanry, which formed 4 Company, 1st Battalion Imperial Yeomanry for service in South Africa. Biggs later reflected how life in the Yeomanry was a constant struggle, and he engaged in 57 skirmishes with his unit coming under daily sniper fire. He was wounded near Vrede on 11 October 1900, when he was <b>shot</b> <b>through</b> <b>the</b> thigh whilst patrolling. He was returned to England on the hospital ship Simla which left Cape Town 26 November and arrived at Southampton on 18 December. He was then commissioned as a second lieutenant on 16 February 1901. On 17 April he was promoted lieutenant and attached to 4th Battalion Imperial Yeomanry. Later in the year he either received a further wound, or fell ill, since The Times reported on 26 September that he had been discharged from hospital and returned to duty in the week ending 8 September. He returned home on the steamship Goorkha, which left Cape Town on 19 July. He relinquished his commission on 12 September, and was granted the honorary rank of lieutenant, and permission to continue wearing his uniform.|$|E
