5|$|Modern {{cross-country}} skiing {{is similar to}} the original form of skiing, from which all skiing disciplines evolved, including alpine skiing, ski jumping and Telemark skiing. Skiers propel themselves either by striding forward (classic style) or side-to-side in a skating motion (skate skiing), aided by arms pushing on <b>ski</b> <b>poles</b> against the snow. It is practised in regions with snow-covered landscapes, including Northern Europe, Canada, Russia and regions in the United States.|$|E
5|$|No <b>ski</b> <b>poles</b> are used, and no {{assistance}} from others (such as being pushed from the gate) is allowed. In heavy snow conditions the tracks can become clogged up, which reduces inrun speed and may cause an unpredictable descent for athletes. Event personnel {{standing by the}} sides of the inrun are often assigned to use leaf blowers to prevent the tracks from clogging up with snow.|$|E

5|$|Slalom was {{originally}} released in 1986 in the arcades {{as part of}} the Nintendo VS. System and was titled Vs. Slalom. This release featured an upright cabinet, a joystick, one jump button, monaural sound, and standard raster graphics. There was also an optional controller upgrade that featured two physical <b>ski</b> <b>poles</b> and shortened skis that the player could stand on and use to control the skier onscreen. The NES version was released by Nintendo in North America in March1987 and in Europe on October15, 1987. Slalom was Rare's first video game developed as a new company. It was also the Stamper brothers' first video game console release.|$|E
5|$|Although {{he learned}} his {{repertoire}} {{by listening to}} elders perform traditional pieces, Rakoto Frah often performed personalized variations and interpreted the traditional airs in original ways. The themes addressed in his songs ranged from serious to light-hearted and could touch on social concerns, behavior and the description of places. Rakoto Frah used both traditional flutes and those he crafted himself using diverse locally available materials. These included flutes crafted from sections of metal <b>ski</b> <b>poles,</b> PVC pipes and plastic curtain rods. He was never known to be without a flute and was widely respected for his musical virtuosity and his kindness alike. Rakoto Frah described music {{the most important element}} of life, even more important to him than his own family. Over the course of his career, the artist produced more than 800pieces of instrumental and vocal music.|$|E
25|$|Para-alpine skiers in this {{classification}} {{have their}} choice regarding how many skis and <b>ski</b> <b>poles</b> {{they wish to}} use, along {{with the type of}} <b>ski</b> <b>poles</b> they wish to utilize, which may include outriggers. The rules FIS rules governing ski boots and bindings are not enforced for this class, with different requirements than rules that apply to that equipment for able-bodied competitors. For below the knee amputees in this class, their ski boot may have their prosthetic leg built into it. In para-Nordic skiing, skiers use two skis and have an option to use one or two <b>ski</b> <b>poles.</b>|$|E
25|$|Lateral {{balance is}} an issue for LW6/8 skiers {{resulting}} from the missing arm, so skiing techniques are worked on by the skier to correct this. One technique used compensates for balance issues by using knee drives or hip motions.

25|$|In para-Alpine, skiers use one ski and two <b>ski</b> <b>poles</b> while para-Nordic skiers use two {{skis and}} two <b>ski</b> <b>poles.</b> Other {{equipment}} {{may be used}} such as outriggers. Specific skiing and training techniques {{have been developed for}} this LW2 skiers that address their disability type and equipment use. A factoring system is used in both para-Alpine and para-Nordic to allow different classes to compete against each other when there are too few individual competitors in one class in a competition. These factors may change from ski season to ski season.|$|E
25|$|Skiers in {{this class}} use two skis and no <b>ski</b> <b>poles</b> in para-Alpine and para-Nordic. While skiers are {{prohibited}} from using traditional <b>ski</b> <b>poles,</b> they may use mini poles {{so long as they}} are unable to hold a traditional ski pole without the use of a prostheses. Skiers are also allowed to use prostheses or orthoses in competition. FIS rules for ski boots and binding heights are followed for this class. Skiers {{in this class}} must wear a Slalom helmet in Slalom events and crash helmets during the Giant Slalom.|$|E

25|$|Skiers in this {{classification}} {{compete with}} one or two skis and two <b>ski</b> <b>poles,</b> except in para-Nordic skiing where the skier must use two skis and two <b>ski</b> <b>poles.</b> Skiers use skis that would be slightly longer than if they were able bodied. Skiing with a prosthesis is allowed in this classification in international competitions. In training, skiers can also use cants, wedges and prostheses with a special skiing prosthesis having been developed for use. The prosthetic may be built into the ski boot for below knee amputees, though FIS rules for ski boots and binding heights are enforced for everyone in this class.|$|E
25|$|For {{standing}} competitors, outrigger skis {{can be used}} in some classifications. These are <b>ski</b> <b>poles</b> {{with small}} skis on the end. They assist a skier balancing as they ski down the slopes, and in moving uphill for short distances, enabling skiers to do things like a climb a slope to get on a chair lift.|$|E
25|$|In {{teaching}} skiers with cerebral palsy, {{instructors are}} encouraged to delay the introduction <b>ski</b> <b>poles</b> as skiers may overgrip them. Use of a ski bra is also encouraged as it helps the skier learn correct knee and hip placement. One method of learning to ski for competitors with cerebral palsy in this classification is the American Teaching System. They first thing skiers learn is what their equipment is, and {{how to put it}} on and take it off. Next, skiers learn about positioning their body in a standing position on flat terrain. After this, the skier learns how to side step, and then how to fall down and get back up again. The skier then learns how to do a straight run, and then is taught how to get on and off the chair lift. This is followed by learning wedge turns and weight transfers, wedge turns, wide track parallel turns, how to use <b>ski</b> <b>poles,</b> and advanced parallel turns.|$|E

25|$|Skiers in this {{classification}} {{compete with}} two skis and two <b>ski</b> <b>poles</b> in both para-Alpine and para-Nordic skiing. In training, they may use {{different types of}} equipment {{depending on the type}} of disability the skier has. As this class includes skiers with paralysis, amputations and cerebral palsy, a variety of skiing techniques and training types are needed. For skiers with balance issues, ski bras are used to learn how to balance on skis.|$|E
25|$|For alpine events, a skier is {{required}} to have their <b>ski</b> <b>poles</b> or equivalent equipment planted in the snow {{in front of the}} starting position {{before the start of the}} race. During competition, the para-Alpine skier cannot use a limb not in a ski for competitive advantage to gain speed or keep balance by putting it in the snow. If they do so, they rules state they will be disqualified from the event.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{equipment}} {{used in the}} sport includes outrigger skis, sit-skis, and mono-skis. Depending on the classification, other equipment may be used by skiers including guide skiers, cut-down <b>ski</b> <b>poles,</b> orthopedic aids, or prostheses. For standing skiers, different class rules determine what sort of equipment is allowed in competition, such as one pole, two poles or no poles, or one or two skis. Rules for equipment use in competition are set by FIS and the IPC.|$|E
50|$|Poles {{are used}} in alpine skiing to add {{propulsion}} and to aid in controlling upper body position at turn initiation.Racing poles have their own unique distinctions. Super giant slalom, downhill, and speed <b>skiing</b> <b>poles</b> are designed to bend around the skier's body while in a tuck position to minimize drag. In slalom <b>skiing,</b> straight <b>poles</b> are used due to the reduced speeds and increased reliance on poles. Slalom poles will often come with a guard attached to the grip {{for the purpose of}} deflecting gates.|$|R
50|$|While <b>ski</b> <b>pole</b> tips are {{generally}} not made of carbide, since {{they do not need}} to be especially hard even to break through layers of ice, rollerski tips usually are.

25|$|Skiers use {{outriggers}} {{for balance}} and as leverage when they fall to right themselves. Outriggers {{are also used}} for turning; skiers use the outrigger and their upper body by leaning into the direction they want to turn. In para-Nordic skiing, outriggers or <b>ski</b> <b>poles</b> are used to propel the skier forward. If skiers fall, they may require assistance in righting themselves, and/or {{getting back to the}} fall line. Doing this on their own, they need to position their mono-ski facing uphill relative to the fall line.|$|E
25|$|Skiers in {{this class}} use two skis and no <b>ski</b> <b>poles</b> in para-Alpine and para-Nordic, though skiers can use mini-ski poles {{provided}} they cannot hold a ski pole {{without the use of}} a prosthesis. Skiers develop techniques to ski that compensate for balance issues as a result of missing arms. A factoring system is used in para-Alpine and para-Nordic to allow LW5/7 skiers to compete fairly against other skiers with disabilities. While this classification was not grouped with others at the 1984 Winter Olympics Exhibition Competition, it was grouped with other standing classes during events in the 1990s and 2000s.|$|E
