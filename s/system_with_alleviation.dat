40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a robust voltage control scheme for microgrids {{based on a}} {{suitable}} designed third-order sliding mode (3 -SM) controller. The use of 3 -SM allows to reject matched disturbances and unmodeled dynamics, due {{to the presence of}} a voltage-sourced-converter (VSC) as interface with the main grid. The motivation for using a 3 -SM control approach, apart from its property of providing robustness to the scheme in front of a significant class of uncertainties, is also given by its capability of enforcing sliding modes of the controlled <b>system</b> <b>with</b> chattering <b>alleviation.</b> The microgrid system controlled via the proposed 3 -SM approach proves to exhibit appreciable stability properties. Specifically, the voltage error with respect to the required reference is steered to zero in a finite time. The comparison with respect to second order sliding mode (SOSM) and PI controllers shows the beneficial effects of the proposed strategy, and simulation results confirm that our control law provides closed-loop performance complying with the IEEE recommendations for power systems...|$|R

40|$|Background: Posterior {{reversible}} encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is {{a transient}} clinical and neuroradiologic syndrome caused by cerebral vasogenic edema.

Case presentation: We report a 43 -year-old man, with undergoing hemodialysis therapy for chronic renal failure, had mild elevation of blood pressure. His consciousness level suddenly deteriorated, and brain MRI demonstrated hyperintense lesions in the bilateral basal ganglia on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images, diffusion-weighted images, and apparent diffusion coefficient maps. After improvement of disturbance of consciousness, he showed FOG accompanied by bradykinesia and postural instability.

40|$|SummaryTo assess {{telomerase}} as {{a cancer}} therapeutic target and determine adaptive mechanisms to telomerase inhibition, we modeled telomerase reactivation and subsequent extinction in T cell lymphomas arising in Atm−/− mice engineered with an inducible telomerase reverse transcriptase allele. Telomerase reactivation {{in the setting}} of telomere dysfunction enabled full malignant progression <b>with</b> <b>alleviation</b> of telomere dysfunction-induced checkpoints. These cancers possessed copy number alterations targeting key loci in human T cell lymphomagenesis. Upon telomerase extinction, tumor growth eventually slowed with reinstatement of telomere dysfunction-induced checkpoints, yet growth subsequently resumed as tumors acquired alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) and aberrant transcriptional networks centering on mitochondrial biology and oxidative defense. ALT+ tumors acquired amplification/overexpression of PGC- 1 β, a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis and function, and they showed marked sensitivity to PGC- 1 β or SOD 2 knockdown. Genetic modeling of telomerase extinction reveals vulnerabilities that motivate coincidental inhibition of mitochondrial maintenance and oxidative defense mechanisms to enhance antitelomerase cancer therapy...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the efficacy of}} Chinese eye exercises on reducing accommodative lag in children by a randomized, double-blinded controlled trial.

The current study was aimed to investigate the effects of depression on both evoked pain behavior (thermal-induced nociception) and spontaneous pain behavior (formalin pain) using an olfactory bulbectomy (OB) rat model of depression. Emotional behaviors were assessed by open field and Morris water maze tests. The {{results showed that the}} depressed rats exhibited stronger tolerance to noxious thermal stimulation compared to non-depressed animals.

40|$|Abstract — Aims: To {{test whether}} the dose-dependent motivation-suppressing effect of {{baclofen}} in animals could be transposed to humans, and suppress craving and sustain abstinence. Methods: Neurologists safely use up to 300 mg/day (10 times the dosage currently used for alcohol dependence) of high-dose oral baclofen, to control spasticity, {{in order to}} avoid invasive therapy. I am a physician with alcohol dependence and comorbid anxiety. I self-prescribed high-dose baclofen, starting at 30 mg/day, with 20 mg increments every third day and an (optional) additional 20 – 40 mg/day for cravings. Results: Cravings became easier to combat. After reaching the craving-suppression dose of 270 mg/day (3. 6 mg/kg) after 5 weeks, I became and have remained free of alcohol dependence symptoms effortlessly for the ninth consecutive month. Anxiety is well controlled. Somnolence disappeared with a dosage reduction to 120 mg/day, now used for the eighth consecutive month. Conclusions: High-dose baclofen induced complete and prolonged suppression of symptoms and consequences of alcohol dependence, and relieved anxiety. This model, integrating cure and well-being, should be tested in randomized trials, under medical surveillance.

Fecal microbiota were analyzed by {{denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis}} (DGGE) and real-time PCR. Combining HCE + metformin resulted in significantly ameliorated glucose tolerance (oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)) —the same as metformin alone. Particularly, results of the insulin tolerance test (ITT) showed that combining HCE + metformin dramatically improved insulin sensitivity as compared to metformin treatment alone. Both fecal and serum endotoxin, as well as cytokines (tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) and interleukin 6 (IL- 6)) were significantly ameliorated by HCE + metformin compared to metformin alone. Meanwhile, the activation of AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) by metformin was distinctly enhanced by HCE.

Methods: 82 patients with incurable synchronous liver metastases, who underwent primary tumor resection alone, were enrolled. Results: The multivariate analysis revealed {{that the presence of}} ascites (P = 0. 001, Hazard ratio = 2. 96) and differentiation (P = 0. 003, Hazard ratio = 3. 68) were found to be significant independent prognostic factors.
