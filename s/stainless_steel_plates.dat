5|$|Named {{for energy}} firm BP, which donated $5million toward its construction, {{it is the}} first Gehry-designed bridge to have been completed. BP Bridge is {{described}} as snakelike because of its curving form. Designed to bear a heavy load without structural problems caused by its own weight, it has won awards for its use of sheet metal. The bridge is known for its aesthetics, and Gehry's style is seen in its biomorphic allusions and extensive sculptural use of <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> to express abstraction.|$|E
5|$|The United States Geological Survey (USGS) {{estimates}} that the annual worldwide production of thallium is about 10metric tonnes as a by-product from the smelting of copper, zinc, and lead ores. Thallium is either extracted from the dusts from the smelter flues or from residues such as slag that are collected {{at the end of}} the smelting process. The raw materials used for thallium production contain large amounts of other materials and therefore a purification is the first step. The thallium is leached either by the use of a base or sulfuric acid from the material. The thallium is precipitated several times from the solution to remove impurities. At the end it is converted to thallium sulfate and the thallium is extracted by electrolysis on platinum or <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plates.</b> The production of thallium decreased by about 33% in the period from 1995 to 2009 – from about 15metric tonnes to about 10tonnes. Since there are several small deposits or ores with relatively high thallium content, it would be possible to increase the production if a new application, such as a hypothetical thallium-containing high-temperature superconductor, becomes practical for widespread use outside of the laboratory.|$|E
25|$|Another device {{which has}} contributed {{significantly}} to milk quality is the plate heat exchanger (PHE). This device utilizes a number of specially designed <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plates</b> with small spaces between them. Milk is passed between every other set of plates with water being passed between {{the balance of the}} plates to remove heat from the milk. This method of cooling can remove large amounts of heat from the milk in a very short time, thus drastically slowing bacteria growth and thereby improving milk quality. Ground water is the most common source of cooling medium for this device. Dairy cows consume approximately 3 gallons of water for every gallon of milk production and prefer to drink slightly warm water as opposed to cold ground water. For this reason, PHE's can result in drastically improved milk quality, reduced operating costs for the dairymen by reducing the refrigeration load on his bulk milk cooler, and increased milk production by supplying the cows with a source of fresh warm water.|$|E

Correspondingly, the MIG weldments showed a noticeable decrease in impact energy and in impact yield and maximum loads as the aging time was increased. The LB weldments, on the other hand, showed an initial decrease in absorbed energy followed by a noticeable increase, because of the appearance of delaminations during the fracture event. Aging at 900 degreesC of the parent metal and of LB and plasma arc (PA) weldments of the superduplex <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> produced a precipitation of sigma phase which was much more intense in the parent metal.

A review of existing methods {{for the design of}} <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> girders, including codified provisions, is first presented. A database of thirty-four experiments carried out on austenitic, duplex and lean duplex <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> girders is then reported, and used to assess the current shear resistance design equations from Eurocode 3 : Part 1. 4 and Eurocode 3 : Part 1. 5 and the recent proposals from the literature. The comparisons clearly indicate that the design provisions of Eurocode 3 : Part 1. 4 are conservative and that improved results can be achieved by applying Eurocode 3 : Part 1. 5 and the proposed expressions of Estrada et al. However, yet further improvements are possible and, based on the available structural performance data, revised design expressions for the calculation of the ultimate shear capacity of <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>plate</b> girders suitable for incorporation into future revisions of Eurocode 3 : Part 1. 4 have been proposed and statistically verified. Unlike the current provisions of Eurocode 3 : Part 1. 4, the design rules proposed herein differentiate between rigid and non-rigid end posts, and, offer enhancements in shear buckling capacity of around 10 %.
