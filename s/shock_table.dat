Firstly, experiments are carried out to observe the dynamic characteristics of typical portable electronic systems and components under drop impact.

By comparing the typical results from <b>shock</b> <b>table</b> tests and those from drop tests, the correlation of <b>shock</b> <b>table</b> test parameters and drop tests conditions is investigated. The results reveal that the conventional fully constrained <b>shock</b> <b>table</b> test cannot mimic the real-life drop impact conditions, while an appropriate <b>shock</b> <b>table</b> test method should allow the sample to rotate freely. Theoretical analysis is developed to explain {{the mechanics of the}} impact scenarios. It is found that due to Hertz contact spring effect and the rotational acceleration during the impact, the acceleration of the centroid sample is significantly different to that of the table.

40|$|Mechanical shock {{tests are}} very {{important}} for portable electronic products such as notebook computers and mobile phones because these products are subjected to high risks of impact loading. Impact loading often plays {{a critical role in}} the functional performance and mechanical reliability of electronic components and devices. Drop tests are adopted usually to the overall product to assess the structural and functional integrity. Traditional test method is to drop the products from a certain height with a quick release hook or drop tester. The obvious advantage for these methods is that they can directly duplicate the field impact scenarios. However, the test repeatability can not be guarantied in drop tests, because it is difficult to control the orientation of the object at impact and to instrument it. Moreover; by considering the real impact conditions, drop tests are not applicable for the shock reliability tests of individual components. <b>Shock</b> <b>table</b> tests are carried out to overcome the drawbacks described above. A shock impulse with a given shape, magnitude and duration is applied to the <b>shock</b> <b>table</b> and then imparted to the sample product or component fasted to the table. However, the <b>shock</b> <b>table</b> test is a simulation of the real-life drop impact process. To make the <b>shock</b> <b>table</b> tests adequately mimic the real drop impact, it is critical to make correlation between the <b>shock</b> <b>table</b> test parameter and field conditions.

40|$|Shock {{is one of}} the {{environmental}} tests that a spacecraft must pass before being cleared for launch. Shock testing poses a challenging data acquisition issue and careful selection of equipment is crucial to creating a successful shock test facility. Cal Poly’s CubeSat programs can currently perform all environmental testing other than shock themselves, so a quality <b>shock</b> <b>table</b> would be useful. Previous groups of students had developed a <b>shock</b> <b>table,</b> and this paper details the improvement and characterization of that shock table’s behavior. Several adjustable parameters were tested and documented to discover trends in the shock table’s response to an impact from a pendulum hammer. Then a test meant to mimic an actual shock test was performed. The CubeSat program provided a component to be tested and a requirement to be met. The nominal requirement is proprietary and cannot be given here, and additional stipulations included the test data being within a given tolerance band and at least 50 % of the test data having a larger magnitude than the nominal requirement. The requirement needed to be met in all three of the component’s axes. The component was mounted to the <b>shock</b> <b>table</b> and acceleration data was collected and analyzed. A successful test was conducted in one axis, which was the result of impacting the large face of the aluminum <b>shock</b> <b>table</b> plate. The tests in the other two axes, conducted with impacts {{to the side of the}} aluminum plate, failed to meet the requirement. A finite element model of the table was developed and correlated to the test data. A new way of attaching the test component to the table was developed that would allow for testing in all three axes to be performed with impacts to the large face of the aluminum plate. A dynamic finite element analysis was performed, and the results indicate that this new attachment method should allow the requirement to be met in all three axes. The <b>shock</b> <b>table</b> is currently fully operational and can be used for testing and teaching purposes. With the implementation of the new attachment method, it is believed that the CubeSat program’s requirements can be met as well...|$|E

40|$|Mechanical shock {{during a}} drop impact is {{reported}} to be the major cause of damage for portable electronics. However, fundamental knowledge in this new field was highly insufficient. This thesis presents our study on the shock response and shock protection of portable electronics. First, systematic experiments were carried out to investigate the dynamic behaviors of a typical portable device under drop impact. An idealized system which contained an outer case and a PCB (Printed Circuit Board) with an attached packaged chip was adopted as specimen. The actual impact force pulses were measured by employing a Hopkinson bar in a dynamic test rig. Particular attention was paid to the dependence of the dynamic response of the PCB on the impact velocity, the force pulse, as well as the impact orientation. A simplified analytical model is proposed to interpret the experimental results. Then, based on the understanding gained from the drop tests, experiments were carried out to evaluate the feasibility of using appropriate <b>shock</b> <b>table</b> tests to mimic the drop environment. A series of <b>shock</b> <b>table</b> test methods were developed and tested. It was found that an appropriate <b>shock</b> <b>table</b> test method should allow the sample to rotate freely. A series of shock tests were conducted to access different fixation methods of the PCB by using foam and/or rubber cushions. Result shows that strong constraint at boundary may alleviate the strain level {{near the center of the}} PCB. However, excessive constrain may cause severe high strain near the supporting points. Fundamental mechanical models are essential for better understanding of the basic characteristic of the shock performance of products. For impact with a given velocity, the analysis of mass-spring models reveals the relationships between the peak force and the impact velocity, contact spring of outer case and natural frequency of component. A beam model is employed to study the dynamic response of flexible structures. The beam model demonstrates that many components an be idealized as a mass-spring system, if the responding strain field is dominated by its first mode. However, if the shock duration is much shorter than the natural period, about 10 orders of modes should be considered to get a good estimation. Some conclusions have been drawn at the end of the thesis and future research work is also suggested...|$|E

Shock is caused by an imbalance between the supply and demand of oxygen.

The inability of peripheral tissues to utilise substrate may contribute to this imbalance. A number of different conditions can cause <b>shock</b> (<b>Table</b> 1. 1).

Peeters (1987) summarized the limited amount of fishery work that had been conducted on the lake. Peeters indicated that surveys conducted in 1957, 1961 and 1985 found that the fishery was dominated by largemouth bass and bluegill. Largemouth bass were fairly abundant for the size of the lake and had a good size structure. Bluegill were very numerous and most (80 - 90 %) were less than 6 inches (150 mm) in length. Other captured panfish species were also less than 6 inches in length.

Stabilised rammed earth is a variant of traditional or pure rammed earth that involves addition of a small amount of cement to improve strength and durability. Rammed earth buildings experience in-plane shear forces as well as flexural stresses due to out-of-plane bending especially during earthquakes. The thesis attempts to examine the behaviour of cement stabilised rammed earth wall elements and building models subjected to lateral loads. A brief introduction to rammed earth construction followed by a review of literature on rammed earth and details of the existing codes of practice on rammed earth is provided in Chapter 1. Chapter 2 deals with the flexural strength, modulus of rupture, stress-strain relationships and free vibration characteristics of cement stabilised rammed earth (CSRE) in greater detail. Properties of raw materials used in the experimental investigations followed by {{a detailed description of the}} experimental programme, method of preparation of various types of specimens and their testing procedures are provided. Flexure strength and modulus of rupture were determined in both the orthogonal directions. Influence of (a) thickness of the specimen, (b) direction of compacted layers with respect to the flexural tension developed and (c) effect of cement slurry coating between the compacted layers on the flexural strength of CSRE were examined. The investigations show that flexure strength increases with the increase in the specimen thickness and a coat cement slurry on the compacted layers leads to improvement in flexure strength. The flexural strength parallel to compacted layers is higher when compared to flexure strength perpendicular to compacted layers. Stress-strain relationships show that the initial tangent modulus of CSRE in saturated condition is about 60 % of that in dry condition. Damping ratio as obtained from the free vibration studies is found to be 0. 022 in the two orthogonal directions. Dynamic characteristics of CSRE building models are presented in Chapter 3. A simple alternative to shake table called as “Shock Table” was used in the present investigation for providing base motion to the building model. A half-scale CSRE building model with R.

Excited, they approach to the meal. But the sheet below the table covered them over, and they were lifted to the airship driven by Gourmet-poy.But Shiro was left behind. When the sheet unrolled, they saw many people eating their meal sitting on chair, who masked and were in black suits {{with two or three}} stars. They were the underlings of A-class gourmet organization.Gourmet-poy came closer to Kasukabe Defense Group, saying [...] "Hi there, you have something you have to give me, right?". Shinnosuke sighs, [...] "It can't be helped. Here you are.", and give his choco-bi. Gourmet-poy got angry and exclaimed, [...] "what's this!?". The kids had a meeting, [...] "Who has the pot?". No one had it, because Shinnosuke had given it to Shiro. They turned towards Gourmet-poy and said [...] "It is with the beautiful lady over there wearing purple lingerie." [...] Gourmet-poy and his underlings searched for the lady who didn't exist at all. The kids run away from there and Gourmet-poy ordered to capture them. They reached {{at the bottom of the}} airship and found some escape pods. They got in one pod. They randomly started pushing buttons, and the pod started to take off to the sky, and the roter came out from the bottom of pod. They had to wear the parachute bag to try to escape from the pod. The canopy was blown off, along with the seat and the kids (Masao was sitting on the blown-off seat). Masao had worn the parachute bag, and Shinnosuke (who was held by others) managed to reach Masao with his gas shoot and held him. They could return safely to the ground. They could also meet Shiro again.|$|R
5000|$|In the song, R. Kelly and Usher {{talk about}} a girl they love who {{turns out to be}} the same person. In the video, during the first verse, R. Kelly is seen in Chicago calling Usher at his home in Atlanta, telling him about a woman that he is in love with, sparing no details. Usher, taken aback by the {{similarities}} to the girl he is dating, inquires further about R.Kelly's new love interest and comes to the conclusion that she is, in fact, the [...] "same girl" [...] as R.Kelly's partner. R. Kelly, in an attempt to resolve the situation working together with Usher, flies out to meet up with Usher in the chorus. As the second verse begins, Usher picks up R. Kelly at the airport in an Aston Martin Vanquish and the two discuss the way they each met this girl in their respective home towns. Eventually, as the two play basketball together, they concoct a scheme to call this girl out on her lies, and show up at dinner with her together, thus shocking and embarrassing her by directly confronting her with her own duplicity. However, at the end of the video, as their plan is carried out, it is in fact Usher and R. Kelly who are <b>shocked,</b> as the <b>tables</b> are turned and it is revealed that they were not, in fact, dating the same girl as they had come to believe; the girl just happened to have an identical twin with an identical car, license plate, ankle tattoo, beauty mark, and child as well as an identical penchant for Waffle House despite living over 700 miles away from her sister; in addition, both possessed a blue and pink phone which they would alternate occasionally. Also, even though one lives in Chicago and the other in Atlanta, both amazingly live on streets of the same name (Peace Street, right on 17th Street). This is never actually stated in the song, though, so it is debatable whether this is also the case within the song itself. However, in the end of the video, they stare at each other dumbfounded as they realized the girl they thought they were both dating is actually extremely identical twins.|$|R
