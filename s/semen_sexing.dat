However, sexed semen from beef bulls became commercially available only recently. The availability of sexed semen from beef bulls along with concerns about success of the technology at the ranch level has limited the use of sexed semen in purebred and commercial beef operations. Recent changes in semen availability combined with current studies with sexed beef semen are providing insights to the uses, limitations, opportunities, and challenges of this technology. Increased sorting capacity allowed the number of beef bulls with gender selected semen available to increase exponentially {{over the last five}} years. For the major US AI studs, the number of beef bulls with gender sorted semen available increased from 0 to 70 from 2008 to 2011 (Hall, 2011).

40|$|The {{world is}} faced with the {{challenge}} to meet the increasing demand for livestock products while conserving animal genetic resource diversity and maintaining environmental integrity. Genetic improvement of local breeds can help to improve the livelihood of the livestock keepers, to increase the production of animal products and to conserve genetic diversity. Implementing breeding schemes in developing countries has proven to be very difficult. The objective {{of this paper is to}} discuss the role of reproductive technologies for the creation and dissemination of genetic improvement in livestock populations in developing countries. In the paper opportunities are discussed for implementing breeding schemes which minimize the need for extensive pedigree and performance recording. It is shown that genetic progress can be generated in a small population. Community-based breeding schemes offer a good starting point for involving farmers in improving local breeds. Artificial insemination to exchange genetic material between communities offers an opportunity to increase the rate of genetic improvement while restricting the rate of inbreeding. Furthermore, artificial insemination is a promising technique for dissemination of genetic gain to producers at a relatively low cost. Opportunities to use <b>semen</b> <b>sexing</b> in a crossbreeding scheme are presented.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. This is a qualitative data collection. Global warming is often thought as being caused by energy production but the second largest contributor is animal production, with methane produced by cows and sheep a key component. One obvious solution is to reduce meat and milk consumption but this {{is unlikely to be}} acceptable to everyone. Moreover, grass-fed animals (such as cows and sheep) can provide other benefits than food, such as managing biodiversity. The UK has a good climate for producing grass and many of the upland regions of the UK cannot be used for cultivating anything other than grass. Grazing animals therefore provide the backbone of many rural communities. A range of different animal breeding technologies, such as traditional genetic methods to improve production efficiency or using biotechnology tools such as <b>semen</b> <b>sexing</b> and even potentially genetic modification, could be used to mitigate the global warming impact of farm livestock. Adoption of these technologies, however, may be limited by the willingness of farmers to purchase these animals. To this end, 42 semi-structured interviews were undertaken (of which 29 are included in this data collection) with sheep and beef cattle farmers across the UK and with industry representatives. Main Topics : Understand cattle and sheep farmers' uptake of breeding technologies {{in the context of the}} system of innovation in animal breeding.

40|$|International audienceMany {{chromosomal}} rearrangements are detected {{each year}} in France on young boars candidates for reproduction. The possible use of these animals requires a good knowledge of the potential effect of the rearrangements on the prolificacy of their mates. This effect can be estimated by an accurate determination of the rate of unbalanced spermatozoa in the semen of boars which carry the rearrangements. Indeed, these spermatozoa exhibiting normal fertilizing ability are responsible for an early embryonic mortality, and then, for a decrease of the litter sizes. The "spermFISH" technique, i. e. fluorescent in situ hybridization on decondensed sperm heads, has been used on several occasions in Man, in this perspective. In livestock species, this method was formerly used mainly for <b>semen</b> <b>sexing</b> purposes. We used it, for the first time, to estimate the rates of imbalance in the semen of four boars carrying chromosomal rearrangements: two reciprocal translocations, rcp(3; 15) (q 27;q 13) and rcp(12; 14) (q 13;q 21), {{as well as two}} independent cases of trisomy 18 mosaicism. The rates of unbalanced gametes were relatively high for the two reciprocal translocations (47. 83 % and 24. 33 %, respectively). These values differed from the apparent effects of the rearrangements estimated using a limited number of litters: a decrease in prolificacy of 23 % (estimation obtained using the results of 6 litters) and 39 % (57  litters), respectively for the 3 / 15 and 12 / 14  translocations. The imbalance rates were much lower for the trisomy mosaics (0. 58 % and 1. 13 %), suggesting a very moderate effect of this special kind of chromosomal rearrangement...|$|E

Response variables were profit, lower 95 % confidence limit for profit, and utility. Responses for selection of sires on profit index at year 10 or 20 were similar and superior to responses from selecting on the basis of milk-fat-protein indexes. Less favorable economic conditions within an international scenario, use of a 10 -year planning horizon, or selection in scenarios with lower absolute responses favor the optimum of using inexpensive randomly chosen young sires. Under a scenario of average economic conditions, use of selected proven and young sires was generally superior to use of randomly chosen young sires for profit and lower 95 % confidence limit for profit at 20 -year planning horizon in all combinations, but was inferior for utility at year 10. Effect of herd size was generally small. ^ A second study investigated optimum conditions for maximizing genetic response in nucleus herds of dairy cattle using multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET), in vitro embryo production (IVEP) and sperm sexing technologies. Deterministic modeling was used to compare 15 -year selection responses in nucleus herds with different combinations of herd size, number of sires used by year, female to male ratio and number of progeny per donor female.

40|$|Aquaculture is an {{essential}} developing sector for world food production, however the attainment of sexual maturity during commercial on-growing is a major bottleneck to industry expansion. Sexual maturation brings a commercial loss due to reduced growth performance as well as reduced immune function. Furthermore, serious concerns exist over potential genetic interaction with native stocks through broadcast spawning or spawning interaction by escapees. In the north Atlantic region, the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) are key aquaculture species in which industry expansion is limited by pre-harvest sexual maturation. However, through a species specific combination of modern technologies and refinement in management practices {{it is possible that}} this sexual maturation can be controlled and on-growing potential enhanced. Thus the overall aim of this thesis was to conduct novel research that will improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that regulate sexual maturation, whilst also advancing the optimisation of technologies for the management of maturation in cod and halibut. In Atlantic cod, owing to the inconsistent inhibition of maturation in commercial conditions, ever increasing intensities of light and in some cases narrow spectrum technologies are being used to try to combat this problem. Firstly, this PhD project investigated the potential welfare impacts of high intensity artificial lighting which have not been studied to date (Chapter 2). The work specifically investigated the effect of traditional metal halide and novel green cathode lighting on the stress response, innate immunity, retina structure, feeding activity and light perception of Atlantic cod. Results indicated that although acute responses to light were observed, there were no clear significant long term effects of any of the lighting treatments on these parameters. Regarding light perception, interestingly even when subjected to high intensity constant lighting (metal halide mean tank intensity: 16. 6 watts m- 2), cod still demonstrated a day/night rhythm in melatonin release which suggests perception of the overlying ambient photoperiod. The second trial of this PhD project investigated the efficacy of shading of ambient photoperiod in addition to constant lighting to inhibit maturation of cod outdoors (Chapter 3). This aimed at improving the performance of artificial lighting regimes in the open cage system during commercial on-growing by reducing the relative difference between day/night light intensities. The trial was conducted over a one year period where a low and high shade treatment were tested in outdoor tanks. Shading increased the relative night time illumination to 6. 6 % and 31. 3 % of daytime levels respectively, compared to < 2 % in an unshaded set-up. Both shading treatments were effective at suppressing sexual development in cod as confirmed through measurements of gonadosomatic index, histological analysis of gonadal development, oocyte diameter measurements and sex steroid profiles as well as measurements of growth. In addition to research at the applied level in Atlantic cod, this thesis has also extended to the fundamental level and explored one of the potential mechanisms relaying photoperiod signal to the endogenous regulation of sexual maturation in cod, namely the kisspeptin system (Chapter 4). Partial sequences for the signal peptide Kiss 2 and its receptor Kissr 4 were isolated and described showing similarity to other teleost species such as the medaka, Oryzias latipes and stickleback, Danio rerio. Novel molecular qPCR assays were designed and developed to measure the expression of both genes in male and female cod over a maturation cycle and compared to cod under constant lighting which remained immature. Interestingly, expression patterns of kiss 2 and kissr 4 did not reveal any clear association with season or photoperiod treatment. However, pituitary expression of gonadotropins (FSH, follicle stimulating hormone; LH, luteinising hormone) did show a differential expression in relation to treatment from early winter approximately 4 - 6 months after the photoperiod change. These new results are in contradiction with the hypothesis that the kisspeptin system would be involved in the initiation of gametogenesis, as shown in mammals. However, the FSH/LH data defines a window during which time kisspeptin or another GnRH stimulating mechanism must be active, this compels the need further investigation. In Atlantic halibut farming, all-female production removes the concerns of production losses through sexual maturation. Accordingly, this thesis investigated the potential/feasibility of generating monosex populations by FACS (fluorescence activated cell sorting) <b>semen</b> <b>sexing</b> based on cellular DNA content, as proven in terrestrial agriculture. Results however did not show any clear differences between the DNA of sperm in a range of species tested (Atlantic halibut, cod, sea bass, perch) suggesting that this technique may not be applicable in such species. The project also focussed on the production of a population of sex reversed halibut broodstock (neomales) that will generate, in the long term, a basis for traditional monosex population generation in the UK. Two in feed MDHT (17 α-methyldihydrotestosterone) treatments were tested with the aim to reduce the use of hormone. Results were very successful with a hormone treatment of 5 ppm MDHT generating a 97 % phenotypic male population thus suggesting the presence of sex-reversed halibut which can be used for future monosex production. Overall, this work aimed to develop and/or refine potential remediation techniques for sexual maturation in two key commercially important farmed marine fish species, cod and halibut, as well as further our understanding on the regulation of puberty. The knowledge gained from this work provides a means to optimise the techniques employed in the industry and has the potential to increase production and profitability without compromising farmed animal welfare, thus ultimately promoting the sustainable expansion of the Atlantic cod and halibut aquaculture.

40|$|Sex {{preselection}} is {{a subject}} that has held man&# 8217;s attention for generations. The {{most effective way to}} achieve sex predetermination is to resolve X and Y chromosome bearing sperm populations. One of the most reliable methods of sorting spermatozoa is flow cyto-fluorimetric analysis, which is based on the difference in the DNA content of the X and Y sperm populations. The difference in the DNA content between X and Y spermatozoa of mammals range from 3. 5 to 4. 2 per cent.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (New Testament)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus in {{association}} with Greenwich School of Theology, U. K., 2008. This work is a comparative study of the usage of the purity language by Jesus and Paul. A simple reading of the Gospels and the Pauline corpus shows {{that the concept of}} purity and impurity is used in different contexts by Jesus and Paul, a fact that is due, I suppose, to their different cultural settings: Palestinian Judaism versus Roman culture. In order to trace the meaning of impurity the concept was analysed as it is employed in the Hebrew Bible and Second Temple sources. It was found that Biblical Judaism placed strong emphasis on ritual and moral impurity, including the diet regulations of Leviticus. Ritual impurity was usually due to natural conditions of the body that were not unwanted, such as menstruation blood, <b>semen,</b> <b>sex</b> and birth, a few specific deceases and contact with dead bodies. Ritual impurity was contagious by contact. Moral impurity was not, but it was a defiling power due to grave sins, such as sexual immorality, bloodshed and idolatry, which polluted the sinner, the sanctuary and the land, even from a distance. The food regulations are interpreted as pedagogical means to remind the people of the importance of worshipping one God only. Since the impure animals were typically hybrids, we argue that the mixture of worshipping YHWH and BAAL was an hybrid cult that created moral impurity. Second Temple literature interprets priestly purity rules to include all Jews, giving rise to the doctrine of generational impurity that, in turn, served the purpose of maintaining a strict border between Jews and Gentiles. In the Qumran milieu we find a developed ontological dualism, the cosmology of which included the teaching of the two spirits, each representing two opposing kingdoms. The gestalt of Satan developed from being a member of God's court to an independent personage with his own host of demons. Roman culture is a complex concept. The philosophers had a world view quite {{different from that of the}} uneducated masses. The Stoics referred to uncontrolled sex as impure, since passions as such were seen as unwanted. Roman religion, as found in the cult of the Vestal Virgins, defined the loss of virginity as the ultimate impurity, which put the entire Fatherland at risk. In popular culture there was a vivid conceptualisation of demons and spirits and a full-blown art of astrology and magic. The aetiology of sickness as demonic attacks was commonplace. When our inquiry of the two cultural contexts is over, all the relevant scriptures of the Gospels and the Pauline letters are analysed. There proved to be a significant difference between the Synoptics and John. Exorcisms and impure spirits are found in the three first gospels only. John operates with the idea of Satan in the context of moral impurity, but he presents no narratives that include demons. The Synoptics present the teaching and practice of Jesus with a strong focus on demons as impure spirits with the ability to speak and to harass people. They are empowered by Satan and they represent the evil opposition of the kingdom of God. Jesus nullifies ritual impurity altogether and even modifies moral impurity, reserving the terminology for evil intentions coming from man's heart. In the Pauline corpus, we find the terminology employed differently. Evil powers are not denoted as impure spirits and there are no narratives or any teaching of exorcism. Paul uses the term much like the Stoic philosophers, to denote sexual immorality. Our inquiry concludes by stating that Jesus uses the term impure to denote ontological impurity as experienced in mental, spiritual and physical destruction, due to demonic presence. Paul uses impurity, mainly as an ethical category denoting individuals who have succombed to temptations of the human nature, sarx. The common denominator between Jesus and Paul is the belief that the holiness of God is stronger than any demonic presence. According to Judaism, impurity was dangerous because it drove away the presence of God from the Temple and the people. Jesus is exercising the power of God and is never prohibited by the presence of impurity. Paul believes that the powers of impurity were conquered at the cross, and therefore not worth mentioning after the death and resurrection of Jesus. While Jesus exorcised demons, Paul encourages his readers to stand firm in the Christian virtues, so that the Devil would flee from them. If the Church did not do this, it became polluted. Paul perpetuates the idea of moral impurity as a defiling force which prevents the presence of God. In the Church, this is manifested as lack of love and consideration for the poor, a situation which prevents the protection of God. As in the Temple, the remedy was sacrifice; in this case, the blood of Jesus, which was remembered and honoured during eucharist. And as in Judaism, it required repentance and a will to do better.

40|$|Several {{studies suggest}} that welding is {{detrimental}} to the male reproductive system. Welding fume and radiant heat are of interest as possible causal factors. This study investigates <b>semen</b> quality and <b>sex</b> hormone concentrations among 17 manual metal arc alloyed steel welders with a moderate exposure to radiant heat (globe temperature ranging from 31. 1 degrees to 44. 8 degrees C), but without substantial exposure to welding fume toxicants. During exposure to heat the skin temperature in the groin increased on average by 1. 4 degrees C (SE +/- 0. 72 degrees C). Sperm count and motile sperm count were non-significantly reduced among welders in comparison with two different reference groups. Within the group of welders the proportion of sperm with normal shape declined significantly after six weeks of exposure to heat and increased after a break in exposure. Sperm count and sperm concentration had {{the same pattern of}} intraindividual change in relation to exposure to radiant heat, but the changes were not statistically significant. No consistent changes in concentrations of sex hormones were found. The welders investigated were more exposed to radiant heat than welders in general. The results suggest that the study group of welders experienced a reversible decrease in semen quality, most likely caused by a moderate exposure to radiant heat (about five hours a day through several weeks). It remains to be established if even lower levels of exposure to radiant heat in the general population of welders has any impact on semen quality and fertility...|$|R
40|$|Producers of {{domestic}} livestock strive to improve genetic influences in their herds. This requires identification, and propagation {{of animals that}} demonstrate desirable characteristics. The more animals available from which to select, the greater the opportunity to discover high-performance animals. Predetermination of the sex of offspring would provide {{a greater number of}} males or females from which to select the top individuals that will contribute the genetics to the next generation. Many attempts at <b>sexing</b> <b>semen</b> and identification of sex in preimplantation embryos have been mildly successful. However, recent advances in gene amplification enable investigators to use sex-specific probes to determine sex in only 1 cell removed from embryos. The biopsy method has had variable success in fresh embryos. However, manipulation of cryopreserved embryos reduces viability of the embryos (Bredbacka, 1998). Therefore, novel approaches to improve pregnancy rates may result in effective reproductive rates. One such approach is to vary the number of manipulated, cryopreserved embryos transferred into each recipient to increase the chances of successful pregnancy. The research performed identified the most successful techniques to biopsy and sex embryos using the mouse as a model animal. DNA from collected cells was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or sex specific probes to determine sex. Secondly, the most effective techniques were applied to cattle embryos and survival rates in micromanipulated, cryopreserved embryos were determined. Finally, recipients were implanted with one or two embryos that sex had been previously determined. Pregnancy rates, including the incidence of twinning, were recorded. The hypothesis tested was: a single method for sexing bovine cryopreserved embryos can yield high accuracy and high pregnancy rates for the desired sex...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} the possible effect of insulin resistance (IR) on male reproductive system via evaluation of <b>semen</b> analysis, male <b>sex</b> hormones and serum lipid profiles, and testicular volumes. Methods: After the exclusions, {{a total of}} 80 male patients were enrolled in this prospective study. Body Mass Index (BMI), Testicular volume, semen samples, serum hormone/lipid profiles, high sensitive C-Reactive Protein (hsCRP) were obtained from all the subjects. Results: The patients {{were divided into two}} groups as study and control according to the presence of IR. There were no statistical differences in terms of age, marriage period, testicular volume, serum levels of hormone and lipid profiles and BMI between the groups. There were no relationship between homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and semen volume (r = - 0. 10, p = 0. 37), total sperm count (r = - 0. 09, p = 0. 39), motility (r = - 0. 15, p = 0. 16) and morphology (r = - 0. 14, p = 0. 19). However, HOMA-IR was closely associated with hsCRP levels (r = 0. 94, p < 0. 0001). Conclusions: Despite of the documented strong inverse relationships between Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and male/female fertility, and also between IR and female infertility via ovarian functions as in polycystic ovary syndrome, to our knowledge, there is no report about any influence of IR on male fertility. DM and metabolic syndrome (MetS) have negative influence on fertility. Thus, IR may be accused of causing detrimental effect on male infertility due to hyperinsulinemic state and being one of the components for MetS. Interestingly, due to our preliminary results, we do not found any inverse correlation between IR and male reproductive functions...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether plasma pregnancy-associated glycoprotein- 1 (PAG- 1) concentrations in pregnancy are affected by persistent Neospora caninum infection in dairy cows. The data analyzed were derived from 22 multiparous cows: 16 N. caninum-seropositive and 6 N. caninum-seronegative animals (used as controls). Three of the 16 seropositive cows aborted during the study period and the corresponding data were analyzed separately. Pregnancy diagnoses were performed on day 40 post-insemination by transrectal ultrasound, and by palpation per rectum on days 90, 120, 150, 180 and 210. Blood samples were collected from each animal immediately before each pregnancy diagnosis, and then at parturition or at the time of abortion detection. Plasma was tested for antibodies against N. caninum and PAG- 1 concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay. In non-aborting animals, the effects of neosporosis (seropositive versus seronegative), N. caninum antibody levels, <b>semen</b> providing bull, <b>sex</b> of the newborn, and day of gestation on PAG- 1 concentrations were evaluated by GLM repeated measures analysis of variance. The effect of the gestation period (first half versus second half) on the N. caninum antibody titer was established by the Student's t-test in seropositive cows. A significant positive effect of gestation day on PAG- 1 concentrations was observed (d. f. = 6; F= 12. 6; P< 0. 0001). For all cows, PAG- 1 concentrations increased steadily during the course of gestation, with peak concentrations recorded at parturition. Neosporosis (P= 0. 493), N. caninum antibody levels (P= 0. 921), sex of the newborn (P= 0. 856) and semen providing bull (P= 0. 087) had no effect on plasma PAG- 1 concentration. There was a significant 52 % increase (P< 0. 0001) in N. caninum antibody titers during the second half of gestation compared to the first half. The fates of the three aborting cows were abortion on gestation day 215 in one, and fetus mummification diagnosed on gestation days 180 and 210, respectively, in the remaining two cows. A luteolytic dose of prostaglandin was applied 30 days after mummification diagnosis in these last two cows, and fetus expulsion was detected on days 215 and 250, respectively. Two of the aborted fetuses were submitted to laboratory analysis and the presence of N. caninum was confirmed by specific PCR. In the cows with a mummified fetus, PAG- 1 concentrations were low or undetectable when the diagnosis was made. These findings suggest that N. caninum infection has no effect on placental function in chronically infected, cows not suffering abortion, while PAG- 1 measurements in aborting animals provide a useful indication of feto-placental status.

40|$|<b>Sexed</b> <b>semen</b> (SS) {{exhibits}} approximately 80 % of the fertilizing {{ability of}} conventional semen (CS), and {{studies have shown}} that this continues through the 8 -cell stage of bovine embryo development. At the time of this study, no information could be found that, when used for IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) development, had been carried to the blastocyst stage. In addition, questions have arisen regarding which of the measured sperm parameters are responsible for the difference between the SS and CS and contribute to this decline in fertility. The goals of this project were to evaluate the effects of using sexed sperm as it relates to embryonic development and to determine if any of the differences in sperm parameters affect embryonic development. A preliminary project evaluated SS and CS from 5 bulls for IVF and ICSI. One bull was selected to provide the sperm (both SS and CS) for the trial, and 1752 oocytes were assigned to either IVF or ICSI. The SS and CS were divided among the available oocytes used for IVF and ICSI. Straws were thawed for 30 s at 37 °C, and sperm were then evaluated for motility (provided by CASA, SpermVision, MiniTube of America, Verona, WI), morphology, acrosomal integrity (Coomassie and Pope stains), viability, and nuclear decondensation (SYBR Green and HALO). Results for SS v. CS were as follows: motility, 8 v. 26 %; viability, 40. 6 v. 30 %; nuclear decondensation, 40 v. 30 %; normal morphology and acrosomal integrity, no differences. Oocytes were obtained from Applied Reproductive Technologies, LLC (Madison, WI). The fertilization rate was consistently lower (Table 1) for both IVF and ICSI when SS were used (Z = 3. 65; P = 0. 0003), and {{there was no evidence that}} this decline in fertilization rate differed for the 2 methods (Z = 0. 18; P = 0. 86). Nor was there any evidence that the method affected the fertilization rate in general (Z = 0. 75; P = 0. 45). Thus, the difference was specific for fertilization rate and had no effect on Day 3 cells or Day 7 blastocysts. A higher fertility rate using ICSI would have indicated that a surface membrane factor may have been decreasing the fertility rate with SS because of the elimination of binding factors associated with ICSI. Thus, it may not be the sperm surface membrane that is distorted in the sexing procedure, but likely the integrity of the spermal DNA, as indicated by the increased nuclear decondensation of SS...|$|R
