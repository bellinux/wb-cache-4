40|$|The {{relationship}} between sexual desire and differentiation <b>of</b> <b>self</b> in couples has been frequently discussed in clinical literature but lacks empirical support. This exploratory study investigates the associations between individual and dyadic {{levels of sexual}} desire, differentiation <b>of</b> <b>self,</b> and couple satisfaction. Similarities and discrepancies in sexual desire and differentiation <b>of</b> <b>self</b> between partners were especially targeted. Partners were {{expected to have a}} lower discrepancy <b>of</b> differentiation <b>of</b> <b>self</b> than unrelated individuals (Bowen's similarity hypothesis). Partners' discrepancy in differentiation <b>of</b> <b>self</b> was expected to be negatively associated with sexual desire, and higher levels of sexual desire and differentiation in the dyad were expected be positively associated with couple satisfaction. Results suggest that partners' similarity regarding differentiation <b>of</b> <b>self</b> predicted individual sexual desire.

40|$|The author {{attempts}} {{to integrate the}} concepts <b>of</b> <b>self</b> used in psychoanalytic theory with {{the understanding of the}} nature <b>of</b> <b>self</b> as explained within the Buddhist meditative tradition. He divides different concepts <b>of</b> <b>self</b> in psychoanalytic theory into three major levels of consciousness and abstraction: self as experience, representational self and self as system. The representational level is defi ned as consisting of unconscious organizing structures of interaction: the system level is a hierarchically higher organization of representations, while the experiential level consists of the moment-to-moment fl ow of consciousness. He argues that for the sake of theoretical clarity these levels be differentiated in discussions <b>of</b> <b>self.</b> He then describes the Buddhist psychology <b>of</b> <b>self</b> and tries to show how this perspective can enrich psychoanalytic understanding <b>of</b> the experiential <b>self</b> and <b>of</b> narcissism, which in Buddhist language would be described as clinging to (seeking or avoiding) images <b>of</b> <b>self</b> that arise in the mind. Last, he describes a model of therapeutic development using different levels <b>of</b> <b>self</b> and the interrelationship between them, showing how psychoanalytic psychotherapy and Buddhist insight meditation emphasize different levels <b>of</b> <b>self</b> using complementary rather than mutually exclusive methods...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the relationship between differentiation <b>of</b> <b>self,</b> anxiety, and cultural identity. It is widely accepted that people with high differentiation <b>of</b> <b>self</b> experience lower levels of anxiety than those with low differentiation <b>of</b> <b>self.</b> Being a theory which originated in western, predominantly individualist culture, the researcher sought to determine whether this would be the case with those who identify with more collectivist cultures. Participants (N = 152) were comprised mostly of women. Participants completed three inventories: the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Differentiation <b>of</b> <b>Self</b> Inventory, and the Self- Construal Scale, which measures whether one identifies predominantly with individualist or collectivist culture. Results supported the hypothesis that those who reported high differentiation <b>of</b> <b>self</b> also reported lower anxiety; those who reported low differentiation <b>of</b> <b>self</b> experienced more anxiety. This was the case among those who affiliated more with collectivism as well as individualism. Conclusions can be drawn that, among participants who reside in an individualist culture, differentiation <b>of</b> <b>self</b> is inversely related to anxiety, regardless of cultural affiliation...|$|R

The rationale was that students enter college with preconceived stereotypes of individuals with diverse appearances according to their worldview, a worldview of diversity which frequently decreases their openness to individuals perceived as different.;The reflective writing responses of 17 students were analyzed using the Ground theory method. The responses were for initial reaction at the beginning and end of the course to pictures of students with diverse appearances. Students also completed reflective writings in six assignments: Pictorial Collage, Prepicture Responses, Culture Project, Trying on a New Identity Project, Transformation <b>of</b> <b>Self</b> Paper, and Postpicture Responses.;The overall influence of the course was assessed by changes in students 2 ̆ 7 self-examination and worldviews. Student 2 ̆ 7 s stage of self-examination was categorized according to the seven stages of the reflective judgment model (King 2 ̆ 6 Kitchener, 1994). All students had a change in self-examination as a result of the course. Stages of worldview of diversity developed by the researcher were used to classify students 2 ̆ 7 attitudes. Sixteen of the 17 students had a change in attitude. Further in-depth analysis <b>of</b> transformation <b>of</b> <b>self</b> was conducted and the transformation <b>of</b> <b>self</b> model was developed.;The transformation <b>of</b> <b>self</b> model is a conceptual model of the two components required for transformation <b>of</b> <b>self.</b> These are self-examination and change in attitudes. Developing self-awareness through self-examination is the first component in the transformation <b>of</b> <b>self.</b> Students who develop self-awareness may continue in one of two directions in transformation <b>of</b> <b>self.</b> One is to achieve only a partial transformation <b>of</b> <b>self</b> by stopping the process <b>of</b> transformation <b>of</b> <b>self</b> after self-examination. The other is to continue the progression <b>of</b> transformation <b>of</b> <b>self</b> by changing attitudes. Students who completed the process by developing self-awareness through self-examination and changing their attitudes achieved a transformation <b>of</b> <b>self.</b> This complete transformation <b>of</b> <b>self</b> led to a broader worldview of diversity and an increased openness to individuals with diverse appearances...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Lysaker and Lysaker (2002) {{employ a}} dialogical theory <b>of</b> <b>self</b> in their {{writings}} on self disruption in schizophrenia. It is argued here that this theory could be enriched by incorporating a discursive and social constructionist model <b>of</b> <b>self</b> (Harre. 1998). Harre?s model enables researchers to use subject positions to identify self construction {{in people with}} a diagnosis of schizophrenia that the dialogical model, which uses analysis of narrative, does not easily recognise. Methods: The paper presents a discourse analysis <b>of</b> <b>self</b> construction in eight participants with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Transcripts from semi-structured interviews are analysed, wherein focus falls on how participants construct self in talk {{through the use of}} discursive devices and subject positioning. Results: The findings indicate that by Harre?s theory <b>of</b> <b>self</b> and the implied method of discourse analysis enables more subtle and nuanced constructions <b>of</b> <b>self</b> to be identified than those highlighted by Lysaker and Lysaker (2002). The analysis of subject positions revealed that the participants constructed self in the form <b>of</b> Harre?s (1998) <b>self</b> 1, self 2 and self 3. The findings suggest that there may be constructions <b>of</b> <b>self</b> used by those diagnosed with schizophrenia that are not recognised by current research methods focusing on narrative.

Ninety-five kindergartners aged between 51 and 76 months (Mage = 5 years, 3 months) participated in the study. An adapted version of the Puppet Interview was used to assess the representation <b>of</b> <b>self.</b> Affective quality (positiveness) <b>of</b> <b>self</b> and openness to admit imperfections were rated independently. Results show significant and positive relations of the positiveness <b>of</b> <b>self</b> with competence and social acceptance, with behavioral adjustment to school, and with behavioral manifestations of self-esteem, all rated by the teacher. In Study 2, Bowlby's assumption was tested that the working model <b>of</b> <b>self</b> is closely intertwined with the working model of attachment to mother. Subjects were 50 children aged between 55 months and 75 months (Mage = 5 years, 5 months). The working model of child-mother attachment was assessed through an Attachment Story Completion Task. The working model <b>of</b> <b>self</b> was measured via the Puppet Interview. Results show a positive and strong connection between the security of the child-mother attachment representation and the positiveness <b>of</b> <b>self.</b> The results <b>of</b> the two studies contribute to the validation of the adapted Puppet Interview.
