50|$|While most {{tanks are}} manufactured, some fuel tanks are still {{fabricated}} by metal craftsmen or hand-made {{in the case}} of bladder-style tanks. These include custom and restoration tanks for automotive,aircraft, motorcycles, and even tractors. Construction of fuel tanks follows a series of specific steps. The craftsman generally creates a mockup to determine the accurate size and shape of the tank, usually out of foam board. Next, design issues that affect the structure of the tank areaddressed - such as where the outlet, drain, fluid level indicator, seams, and baffles go. Then the craftsmen must determine the thickness, temper and alloy of the sheet he will use to make the tank. After the sheet is cut to the shapes needed, various pieces are bent to create the basic shell and/or ends and baffles for the tank. Many fuel tanks' baffles (particularly in aircraft and racecars) contain lightening holes. These flanged holes serve two purposes, they reduce the weight of the tank while adding strength to the baffles. Toward the end of construction, openings are added for the filler neck, fuel pickup, drain, and fuel-level sending unit. Sometimes these holes are created on the flat shell, other times they are added {{at the end of the}} fabrication process. Baffles and ends can be riveted into place. The heads of the rivets are frequently <b>brazed</b> <b>or</b> <b>soldered</b> to prevent tank leaks. Ends can then be hemmed in and <b>soldered,</b> <b>or</b> flanged and <b>brazed</b> (and/or sealed with an epoxy-type sealant) or the ends can be flanged and then <b>welded.</b> Once the <b>soldering,</b> <b>brazing</b> <b>or</b> <b>welding</b> is complete, the fuel tank is leak-tested.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{techniques}} for fabricating fast contracting and relaxing {{shape memory alloy}} (SMA) fibers are presented. Shape memory alloy fibers have demonstrated the largest stress and highest {{power to mass ratio}} of any known actuator technology. However their practical application has been plagued by three major drawbacks, namely: (1) relatively slow expansion of the material despite rapid contraction; (2) problems of mechanically and electrically connecting to the material due to the violent nature of their contractions; and (3) low efficiency in the conversion of electrical energy or heat into mechanical energy. The work associated with this thesis has led to solutions to the first two problems allowing even sub-millisecond contraction-expansion cycle times, and fibers to be attached via light weight but high strength and high conductivity joints. The properties of these fibers are extensively studied. Both linear and rotary actuators are built using these fibers. A new technique is presented to mount nickel-titanium (NiTi) SMA fibers. NiTi alloys are not readily bonded, <b>soldered,</b> <b>brazed</b> <b>or</b> <b>welded</b> to other materials. The new method employs metal deposited on the fiber or between two fibers or between fibers and other parts, creating metallic attachments that are mechanically sound and electrically conductive. Furthermore a new process for the three-dimensional microfabrication by localized electrodeposition and etching has also been developed. This latter process, combined with the first process, can be used to integrate NiTi alloys in micro-mechanisms. The good electrical contacts as well as mechanical contact provided by the new attachment mechanisms are important, since they allow the rapid methods to be employed. Several apparatus were built to study the response of NiTi fibers, in particular to very fast current pulses. Experimental results were obtained to describe the response of the fibers, such as their speed, hysteresis, stiffness and resistivity, and show how these variables change dynamically as a function of time, temperature and stress. Other measurements important for the design of new actuators were done, such as those of efficiency when fast actuation with large current pulses is used. In the third part of the thesis a novel application for fast fiber actuators is presented {{in the form of a}} fast rotary motor for in-the-wheel car rotary motors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper reviews a new, {{low-temperature}} {{process for}} soldering and brazing ceramics to metals {{that is based}} on the use of reactive multilayer foils as a local heat source. The reactive foils range in thickness from 40 µm to 100 µm and contain many nanoscale layers that alternate between materials with large heats of mixing, such as Al and Ni. By inserting a free-standing foil between two <b>solder</b> (<b>or</b> <b>braze)</b> layers and two components, heat generated by the reaction of the foil melts the <b>solder</b> (<b>or</b> <b>braze)</b> and consequently bonds the components. The use of reactive foils eliminates the need for a furnace, and dramatically reduces the heating of the components being bonded. Thus ceramics and metals can be joined over large areas without the damaging thermal stresses that are typically encountered when cooling in furnace <b>soldering</b> <b>or</b> <b>brazing</b> operations. This paper draws on earlier work to review the bonding process and its application to a variety of ceramic-metal systems. Predictions of thermal profiles during bonding and the resulting residual stresses are described and compared with results for conventional <b>soldering</b> <b>or</b> <b>brazing</b> processes. The microstructure, uniformity, and physical properties of the reactive foil bonds are reviewed as well, using several different ceramic-metal systems as examples...|$|R

40|$|Established joining {{techniques}} like <b>welding,</b> <b>soldering</b> <b>or</b> <b>brazing</b> {{typically are}} characterized by {{a large amount of}} heat input into the components. Especially in the case of heat sensitive structures like MEMS this often results in stress induced deformation and degradation or even in damaging the parts. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a more reliable and reproducible method for joining, which is characterized by a well defined and small heat input for only a short time period. So-called reactive nanometer multilayers offer a promising approach to meet these needs. Reactive nanometer multilayers consist of several hundreds or thousands of alternating nanoscale layers, which can exothermicly react with each other.

After activating the chemical reaction by an electrical spark, laser pulse or mechanical impact, a self-sustaining intermixing reaction starts, which propagates through the whole film resulting in a stable intermetallic compound, such as NiAl. The peak temperature of the reaction can be well above 1400 °C, but this temperature is only reached for milliseconds, so that the heat is localized to the solder layers. The components itself remain at room temperature during the entire process...|$|R

50|$|Different {{equipment}} is usually required since {{a soldering iron}} cannot achieve high enough temperatures for hard <b>soldering</b> <b>or</b> <b>brazing.</b> Brazing filler metal is stronger than silver solder, which is stronger than lead-based soft solder. Brazing solders are formulated primarily for strength, silver solder is used by jewelers to protect the precious metal and by machinists and refrigeration technicians for its tensile strength but lower melting temperature than brazing, and the primary benefit of soft solder is the low temperature used (to prevent heat damage to electronic components and insulation).|$|R

25|$|An ammeter shunt is {{a special}} type of current-sensing resistor, having four {{terminals}} and a value in milliohms or even micro-ohms. Current-measuring instruments, by themselves, can usually accept only limited currents. To measure high currents, the current passes through the shunt across which the voltage drop is measured and interpreted as current. A typical shunt consists of two solid metal blocks, sometimes brass, mounted on an insulating base. Between the blocks, and <b>soldered</b> <b>or</b> <b>brazed</b> to them, are one or more strips of low {{temperature coefficient of resistance}} (TCR) manganin alloy. Large bolts threaded into the blocks make the current connections, while much smaller screws provide volt meter connections. Shunts are rated by full-scale current, and often have a voltage drop of 50 mV at rated current. Such meters are adapted to the shunt full current rating by using an appropriately marked dial face; no change need to be made to the other parts of the meter.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} novel, reactive Al-Au nano-multilayered foils, their possible application in different fields and {{a discussion of the}} nano-foils 2 ̆ 7 suitability for dental and jewellery applications. Moreover, this study includes the rapid joining of similar and dissimilar materials, by placing multilayer nano-foils and two layers of <b>solder</b> <b>or</b> <b>braze.</b> The foils precisely control the instantaneous release of heatenergy for the joining and act as a controllable local heat source. The reactive foils 2 ̆ 7 thickness is in the range 10 nm to less than 100 nm and they contain many nanoscale layers that alternate between materials with high mixing heats, such as Al and Au. The foil between the two solder/braze layers melts the solder/braze with the heat generated by the reaction and bonds the components. The use of reactive foils eliminates the need for a furnace and dramatically increases the soldering/brazing heating rate of the components being bonded. Thus, ceramics and metals can be fused over required areas without the thermal stresses that are encountered in furnace <b>soldering</b> <b>or</b> <b>brazing.</b> In addition, a completely new plasma technology is proposed for the manufacturing of nano-foils and the first results of the preliminary experimental testing are presented.

40|$|The use of {{traditional}} joining techniques like <b>soldering</b> <b>or</b> <b>brazing</b> for heat sensitive microstructures {{often results in}} damaging or stress induced deformation of the components. Therefore a technology would be desirable, where heat is produced locally and only for a short time. A very promising approach is the application of socalled reactive nanometer multilayers. Reactive nanometer multilayers consist of several hundreds or a few thousands of alternating layers with thicknesses in the nanometer range that can exothermic react with each other. After a local activation of the chemical reaction by an electrical spark or a laser pulse, a self-sustaining reaction starts, which propagates parallel to the multilayer surface resulting in a stable intermetallic single layer. The peak temperature of the reaction can be above 1000 8 C, but the maximum temperature is only reached for several ten milliseconds. Therefore, the heat remains localized {{in the vicinity of}} the solder layers surrounding the reactive multilayer.

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Since {{the dawn}} of the {{computer}} age, there has been a push to create miniature devices. These devices were initially integrated circuit (IC) devices to perform calculations for computers. As the technology progressed, the scope of the devices diverged to included microelectromechanical (MEMS) devices, meaning that the devices perform mechanical movements via electrical actuation. More recently, a new generation of devices has evolved called microtechnology-based energy and chemical systems (MECS). MECS may employ MEMS technology, however the systems are not designed to produce only mechanical movement. MECS deal with heat and mass transfer, the basic processes used in energy, chemical and biological systems, in the mesoscale realm. Mesoscale devices range from the size of a sugar cube {{to the size of a}} human fist. The possibilities of MECS have not been realized. Heating and cooling systems, chemical mixing/distribution, and locking systems are all potential applications. The devices require: 1) revolutionary design, accounting for the scaling effects on device performance; 2) new fabrication technologies for the creation of these designs; and 3) good material properties for mechanical and chemical interactions. Fabrication requirements for MECS are different than for MEMS in that MECS generally require non-silicon metals. Metal microlamination (MML) has been introduced as a general practice for meeting the fabrication requirements for MECS. Prior MML fabrication methods have emphasized the use of diffusion bonding, <b>soldering,</b> <b>or</b> <b>brazing</b> techniques. This thesis will introduce: 1) a novel microflapper valve design fabricated in mild steel using a novel microprojection welding technique; 2) a novel microfloat valve design fabricated in mild steel using a novel capacitive dissociation process for creating free floating geometries. The devices are characterized by comparing actual flow rates to theoretical flow rates of equivalent orifice sizes. Preliminary results show that the microfloat valve achieved an average diodicity (free flow versus leakage rate) ratio of 11. 19, while the microflapper valve achieved an average diodicity ratio of 4. 08.
