5|$|The name durian {{comes from}} the Malay word duri (thorn) {{together}} with the suffix -an (for building a noun in Malay). D. zibethinus is the only species commercially cultivated {{on a large scale}} and available outside of its native region. Since this species is open-pollinated, it shows considerable diversity in fruit colour and odour, size of flesh and seed, and tree phenology. In the species name, zibethinus refers to the Indian civet, Viverra zibetha. There is disagreement regarding whether this name, bestowed by Linnaeus, refers to civets being so fond of the durian that the fruit was used as bait to entrap them, or to the durian <b>smelling</b> <b>like</b> the civet.|$|E
5|$|Batesian mimicry {{is a case}} of {{protective}} or defensive mimicry, where the mimic does best by avoiding confrontations with the signal receiver. It is a disjunct system, which means that all three parties are from different species. Batesian mimicry stands in contrast to other forms such as aggressive mimicry, where the mimic profits from interactions with the signal receiver. One such case of this is in fireflies, where females of one species mimic the mating signals of another species, deceiving males to come close enough for them to eat. Mimicry need not involve a predator at all though. Such is the case in dispersal mimicry, where the mimic once again benefits from the encounter. For instance, some fungi have their spores dispersed by insects by <b>smelling</b> <b>like</b> carrion. In protective mimicry, the meeting between mimic and dupe is not such a fortuitous occasion for the mimic, and the signals it mimics tend to lower the probability of such an encounter.|$|E
25|$|Four {{explosion}}s {{were clearly}} detected. The fourth explosion {{was so strong}} that the stern of the Cuban ship was submerged and water came in through the hatchway of the engine room. At that time the hydrophones reported a sound similar to a liquid bubbling when it comes from a submerged container that is suddenly opened. The sounds indicated that the U-boat had been hit. To finish the U-boat off, the patrol boat launched two more depth charges, set to explode at 250 feet. A few minutes later, a dark stain was observed {{on the surface of the}} water. A spurt of a black and viscous substance <b>smelling</b> <b>like</b> gasoline came up from the deep. Although there was little doubt that the U-boat had been sunk, Delgado was ordered to take a sample of the contaminated seawater to confirm the victory. But even then it wasn't until after the war, when the Allies seized Germany's naval records, that proof of U-176s sinking was found. According to the seized documents, U-176 was under the command of Captain Lieutenant Reiner Dierksen, had sunk eleven enemy ships in her career, and was herself sunk with all hands lost.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the news}} broke that {{northwest}} Ohio had oil, Standard Oil of Cleveland {{decided to build}} a refinery in Lima. Unlike Pennsylvania's oil, northwest Ohio's [...] "sour crude" [...] was high in sulfur content, <b>smelling</b> <b>like</b> rotten eggs, and customers shunned it. Lima's new Solar Refinery was charged with solving the sulfur problem. Until then, Standard bought and stored as much northwest Ohio crude as was possible to maintain their monopoly. It dropped {{the price of crude}} from more than sixty cents a barrel to forty cents in an attempt to discourage further production.|$|E
2500|$|The {{wine yeast}} Brettanomyces (or [...] "Brett") {{produces}} very distinctive aroma compounds, 4-Ethylphenol (4-EP) and 4-Ethylguaiacol (4-EG), {{that can have}} a wine being described as <b>smelling</b> <b>like</b> a [...] "barnyard", [...] "wet saddle" [...] or [...] "band-aid". To some winemakers and with some wine styles (such as Pinot noir from Burgundy), {{a limited amount of}} these compounds could be considered a positive attribute that adds to the complexity of wine. To other winemakers and with other wine styles (such as Riesling from the Mosel), the presence of any Brett will be considered a fault.

60|$|Then {{they came}} down and lunched plentifully in a nest of loose rocks. In the same place that night they supped more plentifully still. The smoke of Mr. Wilkinson's cigars went up ceaseless and strong <b>smelling,</b> <b>like</b> a pagan sacrifice; the golden glories of Mr. Wilkinson's {{champagne}} rose to their heads and poured out of them in fancies and philosophies. And occasionally they would {{look up at the}} starlight and the rock and see the space guarded by the two cross-hilted swords, which looked like two black crosses at either end of a grave.|$|E
60|$|This, however, was {{a little}} more than Mr. Arden could endure, he made an excuse about seeing to the horse, and escaped; while Mrs. Hunter led the two sisters to her closely shut-up parlour, wainscoted, and hung with two staring simpering portraits of herself and her husband, clean as soap could make it, but <b>smelling</b> <b>like</b> a long closed box.

6000|$|I {{have always}} {{considered}} {{this as the}} first fall I had in life. When I booked my place at the coach office I had had 'Box Seat' written against the entry, and had given the book-keeper half-a-crown. I was got up in a special great-coat and shawl, expressly to do honour to that distinguished eminence; had glorified myself upon it a good deal; and had felt that I was a credit to the coach. And here, {{in the very first}} stage, I was supplanted by a shabby man with a squint, who had no other merit than <b>smelling</b> <b>like</b> a livery-stables, and being able to walk across me, more like a fly than a human being, while the horses were at a canter! ...|$|E
60|$|Lastly {{there was}} the all-pervading stench and the {{intolerable}} heat of the place, since no breath of air could penetrate that forest of reeds, while a minor trouble {{was that of the}} multitude of leeches which fastened on to our bodies. By looking one could see the creatures sitting on the under side of leaves with their heads stretched out waiting to attack anything that went by. As wayfarers there could not have been numerous, I wondered what they had lived on for the last few thousand years. By the way, I found that paraffin, of which we had a small supply for our hand-lamps, rubbed over all exposed surfaces, was to some extent a protection against these blood-sucking worms and the gnats, although it did make one go about <b>smelling</b> <b>like</b> a dirty oil tin.|$|E
60|$|It being Christmas-day, the tranter {{prepared}} {{himself with}} Sunday particularity. Loud sousing and snorting noises were heard to proceed from a tub {{in the back}} quarters of the dwelling, proclaiming {{that he was there}} performing his great Sunday wash, lasting half-an-hour, to which his washings on working-day mornings were mere flashes in the pan. Vanishing into the outhouse with a large brown towel, and the above-named bubblings and snortings being carried on for about twenty minutes, the tranter would appear round the edge of the door, <b>smelling</b> <b>like</b> a summer fog, and looking {{as if he had just}} narrowly escaped a watery grave with the loss of much of his clothes, having since been weeping bitterly till his eyes were red; a crystal drop of water hanging ornamentally at the bottom of each ear, one at the tip of his nose, and others in the form of spangles about his hair.|$|E

Father Simon had the curiosity to stay to inform himself what dainties the country justice had to feed on in all his state, which he had the honour to taste of, and which was, I think, a mess of boiled rice, with a great piece of garlic in it, and a little bag filled with green pepper, and another plant which they have there, {{something}} like our ginger, but <b>smelling</b> <b>like</b> musk, and tasting like mustard; all this was put together, and {{a small piece of}} lean mutton boiled in it, and this was his worship's repast. Four or five servants more attended at a distance, who we supposed were to eat of the same after their master. As for our mandarin with whom we travelled, he was respected as a king, surrounded always with his gentlemen, and attended in all his appearances with such pomp, that I saw little of him but at a distance. I observed that there was not a horse in his retinue but that our carrier's packhorses in England seemed to me to look much better; though it was hard to judge rightly, for they were so covered with equipage, mantles, trappings, &c., that we could scarce see anything but their feet and their heads as they went along.|$|E
