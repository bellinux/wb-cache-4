5|$|The Assemblies of God has {{roots in}} the Pentecostal revival in the early 20th century. The Pentecostal aspects of the revival were not {{generally}} welcomed by the established churches, and participants in the movement soon found themselves outside existing religious bodies. They were forced to seek their own places of worship, and <b>soon</b> <b>there</b> were hundreds of distinctly Pentecostal congregations.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1892, the Carabane {{school was}} one of the first in the region. It began as an all-boys school, but in 1898, three nuns {{belonging}} to the indigenous congregation of the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary began teaching classes for girls. <b>Soon,</b> <b>there</b> were 60students. A school infrastructure description in the region in 1900 reveals that the boys' school in Carabane was open from December to August each year, and that holidays ran from September to November, when parents needed their children in the fields to help cultivate rice. In 1903, when Carabane lost its status as capital, the school was instructing 63 boys and 102 girls. In 1914, it had only 56 boys and 26 girls, a situation similar to that in Bignona.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 Alcoa {{decided to}} build a new rolling mill east of Davenport in Riverdale, Iowa. With the construction, {{concerns}} about postwar unemployment ended. Retailing in Davenport was changed by the inclusion of the automobile into mainstream America. In the late 1940s, parking meters were installed in downtown to encourage rotation of space between different users. <b>Soon</b> <b>there</b> were more cars then the street parking spaces could handle. In 1953, the first multi-story ramp was completed in the state, on the corner of Fifth Street and Brady Street. The large variety of shops kept downtown a retail leader even after the opening of the Village Shopping Center in 1956. Another first for Iowa.|$|E

5|$|The game {{opens in}} Paris, {{a day before}} the {{original}} game's start, with journalist Nicole Collard receiving a request {{to go to the}} Palais Royale, to interview a famous media tycoon and potential candidate for President of France, Pierre Carchon. A mime hangs around outside Carchon's home, but Nico ignores him and goes on inside the house. She meets Carchon's wife, Imelda, as well as Carchon, who reveals that he knew Nico's father, Thierry Collard, very well. <b>Soon,</b> <b>there</b> is a noise in the drawing room; Carchon investigates only to be shot. Nico rushes to the scene to see the mime over Pierre's corpse. She is knocked to the ground before she can do anything and wakes up to find Imelda going to call the police.|$|E
5|$|Vainio's {{childhood}} {{heart problems}} surfaced again in 1990 {{with his sister}} Marja recalling that he often placed {{his hand over his}} heart. He had even finished writing his will. At one time Vainio was travelling to Florida with his friend, composer Veikko Samuli. Vainio {{had to go to the}} bathroom during the flight, and <b>soon</b> <b>there</b> was a call for a doctor from the flight crew. Vainio had kept his heart medicines in his pocket, where the box had opened and mixed with his pastilles. Vainio had eaten too much of the medicine by accident, and his heartbeat started to slow down. Once a stewardess found out what had happened, she saved Vainio's life by quickly forcing him to vomit.|$|E
5|$|Christian metal soon {{developed}} {{into its own}} independent record labels and networks. The first Christian metal label was Pure Metal Records, a sublabel of Refuge Records. <b>Soon</b> <b>there</b> appeared other labels such as R.E.X. Records and Intense Records. Fanzines were published in several countries, with Heaven's Metal as {{the first one in}} the US in 1985. During that time almost every Christian record label became interested in Christian metal, and they advertised the newly signed metal bands on their roster on Heaven's Metal since it was the only publication exclusively covering the movement. Soon Heaven's Metal achieved more popularity and became an official, professional publication. Heaven's Metal achieved a dedicated flock of 15,000 readers. Bands' sales usually rose when the ensembles were covered on the magazine. During the 1980s and early 1990s, the more underground Christian metal releases were typically distributed in Christian bookstores, and those as well as the fanzines also traded Christian metal cassette copies with the music fans.|$|E

5|$|The main {{market for}} the charter {{services}} was Stavanger Airport, Sola, mainly serving transport of personnel in the oil industry. By the 1980s, Norsk Air had up to four daily round trips between the two cities. In 1983, the airline received concession to start a regular scheduled service to Stavanger. A ten-seat Beechcraft Super King Air was bought and services started on 12 January 1984. Services to Bergen Airport, Flesland started on 10 July. <b>Soon</b> <b>there</b> were four daily round trips to both cities, supplemented by charter trips operated by Penguin. Starting on 26 March 1984, Norsk Flytjeneste experienced competition on the routes from Sandefjord to Bergen and Stavanger, when Busy Bee, on contract with Braathens SAFE, started flights using 50-passenger Fokker F27s. However, they operated only one round trip, with the same aircraft serving Sandefjord–Stavanger–Haugesund–Bergen.|$|E

25|$|Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei {{believes}} abrogation in Quranic verses is not {{an indication}} of contradiction but an indication of addition and supplementation. As an example he mentions 2:109 where -according to him- it clearly states the forgiveness is not permanent and <b>soon</b> <b>there</b> will be another command (through another verse) on this subject that completes the matter. He also mentions 4:15 where the abrogated verse indicates its temporariness.|$|E

25|$|When the USA {{entered the}} war, Allied {{resources}} were pooled {{at the request}} of the British and the U.S. established a large research program and industrial complex at Fort Detrick, Maryland in 1942 under the direction of George W. Merck. The biological and chemical weapons developed during that period were tested at the Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah. <b>Soon</b> <b>there</b> were facilities for the mass production of anthrax spores, brucellosis, and botulism toxins, although the war was over before these weapons could be of much operational use.|$|E

The ABC expanded its audience in rural areas with the new ABC Rural. The Country Hour, which began in 1945, did surprisingly well even in city areas. The ABC followed it up with The Land and its People, a series of documentaries, and the iconic radio serial, Blue Hills in 1949. Moses did not neglect high culture; in 1945 he reached {{an agreement with the}} Sydney City Council to create an ABC orchestra. <b>Soon</b> <b>there</b> were ABC orchestras in all the state capitals.|$|E

Busy Bee started flights from Torp on 26 March 1984. It operated a single daily round trip from Sandefjord via Stavanger and Haugesund to Bergen. The company never made a profit on the service, and terminated it in 1991. This followed an agreement that one Fokker 50 aircraft was {{to be sold to}} Widerøe Norsk Air.
