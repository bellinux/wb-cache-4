30|$|Yet in {{the same}} {{regressions}} with R&D expenditure, three cultural variables {{turn out to be}} significant; the power distance index, individualism, and the uncertainty avoidance index. These three cultural variables all show the effects in the expected directions. Patent applications are likely to be larger in <b>societies</b> <b>with</b> less power hierarchy, <b>societies</b> <b>with</b> more individualistic values, and <b>societies</b> <b>with</b> less aversion to uncertainty. More specifically, the coefficient on PDI tells us that one standard deviation increase in the power distance index, i.e., 20 out of 100 – equivalent to the difference between Hungary (PDI[*]=[*] 46) and Turkey (PDI[*]=[*] 66) – would generate 0.48 % fewer PCT patents per 100, 000 people.|$|R
