40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the prevalence and clinical correlations of catatonia in patients aged over 65 years who {{are referred to}} a consultation-liaison service within a regional area of Australia. Additionally, to examine if the use of <b>standardised</b> <b>screening</b> tools is likely to change the rate of diagnosis of catatonia within the consultation-liaison service. Methods: One hundred and eight referrals from general hospital wards were assessed using the Bush-Francis Catatonia Screening Instrument (BFCSI) and associated examination; each consented patient was screened for catatonic symptoms. If two or more signs were present on the BFCSI, then severity was rated using the Bush-Francis Catatonia Rating Scale. These clinical characteristics were compared with their socio-demographic and medical data. Results: Prevalence of catatonia was 5. 5 %. The most common symptoms appeared to be rigidity, posturing and immobility (67 % of cases), and were elicited through routine psychiatric examination. Conclusions: Routine psychiatric history and examination are likely sufficient to elicit catatonic signs in a consultation-liaison setting. <b>Standardised</b> <b>screening</b> examination may be more suited for conducting research or for use when examining for catatonia in psychiatric inpatient settings...|$|R
