5|$|Monument 106 is the {{earliest}} <b>securely</b> dated monument at the site, dating to AD 593. It depicts Ruler 1.|$|E
5|$|The North Structure of the E-Group has {{not been}} <b>securely</b> dated but is {{believed}} to date to the Late Classic, based on comparisons with E-Groups at other Maya cities.|$|E
5|$|The South Structure of the E-Group has {{not been}} <b>securely</b> dated but is also {{believed}} to have been built in the Late Classic.|$|E
5|$|A toddler who is <b>securely</b> {{attached}} {{to his or her}} parent (or other familiar caregiver) will explore freely while the caregiver is present, typically engages with strangers, is often visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and is generally happy to see the caregiver return. The extent of exploration and of distress are affected, however, by the child's temperamental make-up and by situational factors as well as by attachment status. A child's attachment is largely influenced by their primary caregiver's sensitivity to their needs. Parents who consistently (or almost always) respond to their child's needs will create <b>securely</b> attached children. Such children are certain that their parents will be responsive to their needs and communications.|$|E
5|$|La Trinidad de Nosotros {{has been}} {{tentatively}} identified as Xililchi, a settlement visited by conquistador Martín de Ursúa after Spanish Conquest of the Itza capital Noj Petén in 1697, but no Late Postclassic remains have yet been <b>securely</b> identified.|$|E
5|$|Many {{fragments}} {{that are}} <b>securely</b> {{attributed to the}} Catalogue, {{some of which are}} relatively substantial, cannot be placed within the poem because their content is either too obscure or could be assigned to different individuals or genealogies which are themselves difficult to locate within the five books.|$|E
5|$|No {{surviving}} Greek texts written {{after the}} year 100 can be <b>securely</b> {{identified as having}} a Jewish author. After this time, Jewish writings in Greek became irrelevant to Christians, who were thus unlikely to preserve them. The manuscription tradition of medieval Jewish culture has preserved only writings in Hebrew and Aramaic.|$|E
5|$|On 20 January 2007, with United Nations Security Council Resolution 1744, the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) was {{formally}} authorised, {{making it possible}} to <b>securely</b> assure the government's presence in Mogadishu. Seven hundred Ugandan troops, earmarked for AMISOM, were landed at Mogadishu airport on 7–8 March 2007.|$|E
5|$|Other {{changes in}} this release include SONAR 4, Google Chrome {{compatibility}} for Identity Safe and Safe Web {{and the ability}} to store passwords and notes in the cloud. However, the License Agreement does not guarantee passwords are stored <b>securely</b> and provides no remedy if the cloud vault is compromised.|$|E
5|$|Piracy—both illicit {{in ancient}} Cilicia and China and state-supported among the Cretans, Vikings, Japanese, English, and Berbers—has {{remained}} a problem {{into the present}} day, given the expense involved in <b>securely</b> protecting every merchant vessel or in policing extensive coastlines.|$|E
5|$|<b>Securely</b> {{attached}} {{children are}} {{best able to}} explore when they have the knowledge of a secure base (their caregiver) to return to in times of need. When assistance is given, this bolsters the sense of security and also, assuming the parent's assistance is helpful, educates the child in {{how to cope with}} the same problem in the future. Therefore, secure attachment {{can be seen as the}} most adaptive attachment style. According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes <b>securely</b> attached when the parent is available and able to meet the needs of the child in a responsive and appropriate manner. At infancy and early childhood, if parents are caring and attentive towards their children, those children will be more prone to secure attachment.|$|E
5|$|The medalet is {{the first}} {{northern}} European artistic work to display a patriarchal cross, {{and it is also}} the first <b>securely</b> datable item to use the circle crossing a cross.|$|E
5|$|While at Oxford, Simon, {{along with}} John of Tynemouth, Honorius of Kent, and {{possibly}} Nicholas de Aquila {{are the first}} <b>securely</b> attested lecturers on law known for Oxford. Simon may also have studied canon law at Bologna.|$|E
5|$|A {{recurring}} {{horror story}} on many websites and popular media outlets is that Japanese soldiers during World War II inflicted bamboo torture upon prisoners of war. The victim was supposedly tied <b>securely</b> in place above a young bamboo shoot. Over several days, the sharp, fast growing shoot would first puncture, then completely penetrate the victim's body, eventually emerging {{through the other}} side. Possibility of this method was tested on an episode of MythBusters, and confirmed.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Alexandria, Shahrbaraz and his forces {{extended}} Sasanian rule southwards along the Nile. By 621, the province was <b>securely</b> in Sasanian hands, and a certain Sahralanyozan was appointed as its governor. In 622, Heraclius counter-attacked against the Sasanian Empire in Anatolia. Shahrbaraz was sent over there to deal with him, but was eventually defeated by him.|$|E
5|$|Although later medieval traditions {{described}} Pain as a chamberlain to King Henry, {{that position}} is not <b>securely</b> confirmed in contemporary records. He did hold other offices, however, {{including that of}} sheriff in two counties near the border between England and Wales. In his capacity as a royal justice, Pain also heard legal cases for the king throughout much of western England.|$|E
5|$|Burial 69 {{was found}} {{in front of the}} base of Group 18 Structure 2. The remains were {{extremely}} poorly preserved but the deceased may have been laid out on their back with the head towards the north. Associated funerary offerings included a tripod plate, a polychrome vase and a flint projectile point. The burial was <b>securely</b> dated to the Late Classic.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes {{in several}} orders have keel-like {{extensions}} of the body-wall known as paranota, which can vary widely in shape, size, and texture; modifications include lobes, papillae, ridges, crests, spines and notches. Paranota may allow millipedes to wedge more <b>securely</b> into crevices, protect the legs, or make the millipede more difficult for predators to swallow.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} Katharine Keats-Rohan records {{his death}} as occurring in 1157 or 1158. Robert's successor as dean, Robert Butevilain, is first <b>securely</b> attested as dean on 6 May 1158, {{and the last}} secure date for his holding his previous office is 13 December 1157, which suggests that Robert of Ghent died in between those dates, or shortly before the earlier date.|$|E
5|$|The {{reservoir}} {{was also}} once popular with anglers (through the Cardiff Fly Fishing Club), picnickers, birdwatchers and walkers. Fishing at the reservoir stopped in 1998 {{and many of}} the other activities have been curtailed since 2004 due to the security fence that was constructed around the banks of the reservoir and (less <b>securely)</b> to the site boundary.|$|E
5|$|A small example {{excavated}} {{from underneath}} the Late Preclassic levels of Structure E3-1 at Chalchuapa in El Salvador may date to the Middle Preclassic. Three potbelly monuments were found resting on a large terrace in Santa Leticia in El Salvador, a site near Chalchuapa consisting of various mounds and platforms. These monuments were large and especially obese. Santa Leticia Monuments 1 and 3 were important in <b>securely</b> dating the potbelly style of sculpture. The El Salvador potbellies conform to the Monte Alto style of boulder sculpture.|$|E
5|$|After {{several months}} he spent as an {{experimental}} case, military authorities began {{to press for}} Tarrare {{to be returned to}} active duty. Dr. Courville was keen to continue his investigations into Tarrare's eating habits and digestive system, and approached General Alexandre deBeauharnais with a suggestion that Tarrare's unusual abilities and behaviour could be put to military use. A document was placed inside a wooden box which was in turn fed to Tarrare. Two days later, the box was retrieved from his excrement, with the document still in legible condition. Courville proposed to deBeauharnais that Tarrare could thus serve as a military courier, carrying documents <b>securely</b> through enemy territory with no risk of their being found if he were searched.|$|E
5|$|Both Hougoumont and Papelotte were {{fortified}} and garrisoned, {{and thus}} anchored Wellington's flanks <b>securely.</b> Papelotte also commanded {{the road to}} Wavre that the Prussians would use to send reinforcements to Wellington's position. On {{the western side of}} the main road, and in front of the rest of Wellington's line, was the farmhouse and orchard of La Haye Sainte, which was garrisoned with 400 light infantry of the King's German Legion. On {{the opposite side of the}} road was a disused sand quarry, where the 95th Rifles were posted as sharpshooters.|$|E
5|$|British law {{requires}} that temazepam (but not midazolam) be stored in safe custody. Safe custody requirements ensures that pharmacists and doctors holding stock of temazepam must store it in <b>securely</b> fixed double-locked steel safety cabinets and maintain a written register, which must be bound and contain separate entries for temazepam and must be written in ink with no use of correction fluid (although a written register is not required for temazepam in the United Kingdom). Disposal of expired stock must be witnessed by a designated inspector (either a local drug-enforcement police officer or official from health authority). Benzodiazepine abuse ranges from occasional binges on large doses, to chronic and compulsive drug abuse of high doses.|$|E
5|$|Cortés {{arrived in}} Honduras in 1525, {{bringing}} livestock with him. Cortés claimed jurisdiction over Honduras, although its extent was still unknown. He rapidly imposed his {{authority over the}} rival Spanish factions there, {{as well as some}} native groups. He founded the settlement of Natividad de Nuestra Señora near Puerto de Caballos, settled fifty colonists there, and placed Diego de Godoy in charge. Cortés then sailed on to Trujillo. Conditions in Natividad were unhealthy, and half of the Spanish settlers rapidly succumbed to disease. With the permission of Cortés, the rest moved inland to the fertile Naco Valley, where Sandoval had <b>securely</b> established a Spanish presence.|$|E
5|$|Crete {{had been}} the target of Muslim attacks since the first wave of the Muslim conquests in the mid-7th century. It had {{suffered}} a first raid in 654 and again in 674/675, and parts of the island were temporarily occupied during the reign of the Umayyad Caliph al-Walid I (r. 705–715). Nevertheless, the island was never conquered and despite occasional raids in the 8th century it remained <b>securely</b> in Byzantine hands; Crete was too far from the Arab naval bases in the Levant for an effective expedition against it to be undertaken.|$|E
5|$|DIN {{screw thread}} {{connectors}} - the regulator screws into the cylinder valve trapping the O-ring <b>securely</b> between the sealing {{face of the}} valve and the O-ring groove in the regulator. These are more reliable than A-clamps because the O-ring is well protected, but many countries do not use DIN fittings widely on compressors, or cylinders which have DIN fittings, so a diver traveling abroad with a DIN system may need to take an adaptor, either for connecting the DIN regulator to a rented cylinder, or for connecting an A-clamp filler hose to a DIN cylinder valve.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sport}} of ferret-legging, {{competitors}} tie their trousers at the ankles before placing two ferrets inside and <b>securely</b> fastening their belts to prevent the ferrets from escaping. Each competitor then {{stands in front of}} the judges for as long as he can. Competitors cannot be drunk or drugged, nor can the ferrets be sedated. In addition, competitors are not allowed to wear underwear beneath their trousers, which must allow the ferrets free access from one leg to the other, and the ferrets must have a full set of teeth that must not have been filed or otherwise blunted. The winner is the person who lasts the longest.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all {{octopuses}} are predatory; bottom-dwelling octopuses eat mainly crustaceans, polychaete worms, {{and other}} molluscs such as whelks and clams; open-ocean octopuses eat mainly prawns, {{fish and other}} cephalopods. Major items in the diet of the giant Pacific octopus include bivalve molluscs such as the cockle Clinocardium nuttallii, clams and scallops, and crustaceans such as crabs and spider crabs. Prey that {{it is likely to}} reject include moon snails, because they are too large, and limpets, rock scallops, chitons and abalone, because they are too <b>securely</b> fixed to the rock.|$|E
5|$|On 8–9 July 1960, the {{soldiers}} were invited to appoint black officers, and 'command of the army passed <b>securely</b> {{into the hands of}} former sergeants,' as {{the soldiers}} in general chose the most-educated and highest-ranked Congolese army soldiers as their new officers. Most of the Belgian officers were retained as advisors to the new Congolese hierarchy, and calm returned to the two main garrisons at Leopoldville and Thysville. The Force Publique was renamed the Armée nationale congolaise (ANC), or Congolese National Armed Forces. However, in Katanga Belgian officers resisted the Africanisation of the army.|$|E
5|$|Only {{two large}} mastaba tombs can be <b>securely</b> dated into Khaba's reign. The {{first one is}} known as Mastaba Z500, which is located at Zawyet el'Aryan. It lies around 200m north of the Layer Pyramid and has a south-north-orientation. The mastaba ist made of mudbricks, its outer wall is niched and it {{contains}} only two large chambers without any typical tomb architecture elements. Because of this, Egyptologists such as Nabil Swelim believe that Mastaba Z500 {{was in fact a}} mortuary temple, belonging to the funerary complex of the Layer Pyramid. The datation of the building into Khaba's reign is based on numerous diorite and dolomite vessels and mud seal fragments, bearing the serekh name of king Khaba.|$|E
5|$|Solomon was {{succeeded by}} his nephew Sergius, who proved {{completely}} inadequate {{in dealing with}} the situation. The Moors launched a general revolt and inflicted a severe defeat on the Byzantines in Thacia in 545. Sergius was recalled, while the army mutinied again, this time under Guntharis, who captured Carthage and installed himself there as an independent ruler. His usurpation did not last long as he was assassinated by Artabanes, {{but it was not until}} the arrival of John Troglita in late 546 and his subsequent campaigns that the province was to be pacified and brought again <b>securely</b> under Byzantine imperial control.|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of the layer pyramid allows it to be <b>securely</b> dated to the time span between the reigns of king Sekhemkhet and that of king Snofru, {{the founder of the}} 4th Dynasty. Rainer Stadelmann, Miroslav Verner and Jean-Philippe Lauer compare the {{architecture of}} the layer pyramid with that of the step pyramids of Djoser and Sekhemkhet, expecting the layer pyramid to have originally consisted of five steps, just as its near-contemporary predecessors. The layer pyramid exhibits at one site both complex developments concerning its substructures and simplifications concerning the building methods employed for the superstructure. According to these egyptologists, the layer pyramid is a clearly advanced version of the buried pyramid of Sekhemkhet.|$|E
5|$|The dating of potbelly sculptures {{has been}} {{problematic}} with {{few of the}} earlier known sculptures being found in their original context. Investigators from the 1950s through to the 1970s argued that the style was Olmec derived or perhaps pre-Olmec. Olmec culture is judged to have lasted from 1500 BC through to 400 BC based on radiocarbon dating. Investigations at Santa Leticia were focused on answering the dating problem and <b>securely</b> dated Santa Leticia Monuments 1 and 3 to between 500 BC and AD 100 {{using a combination of}} radiocarbon dating and ceramic evidence.|$|E
5|$|The first {{mention of}} John occurs in 1188 {{when he was}} {{teaching}} at Oxford. This record notes that he witnessed a legal case decided by delegated judges for the Bishop of Lincoln. Along with a few other instructors, including Simon of Southwell, Honorius of Kent, and possibly Nicholas de Aquila, John {{was among the first}} <b>securely</b> attested legal teachers at Oxford. While at Oxford he lectured on the Decretum Gratiani {{and was one of the}} teachers of Thomas of Marlborough, later writer of the Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham, or Chronicle of the Abbey of Evesham. It is not quite clear when John taught Thomas, but Thomas attests in his Chronicon that John was one of Thomas' teachers. Nothing else is known of John's early life or where he studied law, but presumably like other early English canon lawyers, he studied somewhere on the Continent before returning to England to teach or practice. It is possible that he served as a canon of Lincoln Cathedral during the 1190s, but this is not <b>securely</b> attested. By the late 1190s, John was a member of the household of Hubert Walter, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Besides Walter, another of his patrons was Walter de Coutances, the Archbishop of Rouen.|$|E
5|$|The pig-faced women {{exhibited}} at fairs were not genuine. Showmen would drug a bear into a stupor by feeding it {{large amounts of}} strong beer, and then shave it. Once shaved, the drunken bear would be fitted with padded artificial breasts, and dressed in women's clothing and a wig. Shoes would {{be attached to the}} bear's hind paws, and stuffed gloves to the front paws. The bear would then be placed in a chair with a hole in the back, and <b>securely</b> tied to the chair.|$|E
