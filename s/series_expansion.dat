In attempting to solve astronomical problems, the Kerala school independently created {{a number of}} important mathematics concepts, including <b>series</b> <b>expansion</b> for trigonometric functions. Following the instructions of the Wood's despatch of 1854, both the princely states, Travancore and Cochin, launched mass education drives with support from agencies, mainly based on castes and communities and introduced a system of grant-in-aid to attract more private initiatives. The efforts by leaders, Vaikunda Swami, Narayana Guru, Ayyankali and Kuriakose Elias Chavara towards aiding the socially discriminated castes in the state, with the help of community-based organisations like Nair Service Society, SNDP, Muslim Mahajana Sabha, Yoga Kshema Sabha (of Nambudiris) and congregations of Christian churches, {{led to the development of}} mass education in Kerala.|$|E

Whenever a state derivative is encountered, resolve it by inserting the complete set of basis, then the Hellmann-Feynman theorem is applicable.

25|$|Many {{differential}} equations cannot be solved using symbolic computation ("analysis"). For practical purposes, however– {{such as in}} engineering– a numeric approximation to the solution is often sufficient. The algorithms studied here {{can be used to}} compute such an approximation.

40|$|A {{comparative}} study between two distinct perturbative <b>series</b> <b>expansions</b> for the pair-creation contact process is presented. In {{contrast to the}} ordinary contact process, whose supercritical <b>series</b> <b>expansions</b> provide accurate estimates for its critical behavior, the supercritical approach does not work properly when applied to the pair-creation process. To circumvent this problem a procedure is introduced in which one-site creation {{is added to the}} pair-creation. An alternative method is the generation of subcritical <b>series</b> <b>expansions</b> which works even for the case of the pure pair-creation process. Differently from the supercritical case, the subcritical series yields estimates that are compatible with numerical simulations...|$|R

25|$|This {{equation}} {{is difficult to}} solve and does not follow the principle of linear superposition {{for the relationship between}} the number of charges and the strength of the potential field. It has been solved by the Swedish mathematician Thomas Hakon Gronwall and his collaborators physicical chemists V.K. La Mer and Karl Sandved in a 1928 paper from Physikalische Zeitschrift which deals with extensions to Debye-Huckel theory which resorted to Taylor <b>series</b> <b>expansion.</b>|$|E
25|$|All this {{refers to}} complex {{analysis}} in one variable. There {{is also a}} very rich theory of complex analysis in more than one complex dimension in which the analytic properties such as power <b>series</b> <b>expansion</b> carry over whereas most of the geometric properties of holomorphic functions in one complex dimension (such as conformality) do not carry over. The Riemann mapping theorem about the conformal relationship of certain domains in the complex plane, which {{may be the most important}} result in the one-dimensional theory, fails dramatically in higher dimensions.|$|E
25|$|Next, a {{solution}} for the non-linear wave problem (including the Taylor <b>series</b> <b>expansion</b> around the mean or still surface elevation) is sought {{by means of a}} perturbation series – known as the Stokes expansion – in terms of a small parameter, most often the wave steepness. The unknown terms in the expansion can be solved sequentially. Often, {{only a small number of}} terms is needed to provide {{a solution}} of sufficient accuracy for engineering purposes. Typical applications are in the design of coastal and offshore structures, and of ships.|$|E

Much of the controversy centred around the convergence of the power <b>series</b> <b>expansion</b> used and, in 1860, Adams duplicated his results without using a power series. Sir John Lubbock also duplicated Adams's results and Plana finally concurred. Adams's view was ultimately accepted and further developed, winning him the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1866. The unexplained drift is now known to be due to tidal acceleration.|$|E
25|$|Different {{choices for}} the frame of {{reference}} and expansion parameters are possible in Stokes-like approaches to the non-linear wave problem. In 1880, Stokes himself inverted the dependent and independent variables, by taking the velocity potential and stream function as the independent variables, and the coordinates (x,z) as the dependent variables, with x and z being the horizontal and vertical coordinates respectively. This has the advantage that the free surface, in a frame of reference in which the wave is steady (i.e. moving with the phase velocity), corresponds with a line on which the stream function is a constant. Then the free surface location is known beforehand, and not an unknown part of the solution. The disadvantage is that the radius of convergence of the rephrased <b>series</b> <b>expansion</b> reduces.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} solve the American option pricing problem in the Black Scholes framework that generalizes the Barone-Adesi, Whaley method [1]. An auxiliary parameter is introduced in the American option pricing problem. Power <b>series</b> <b>expansions</b> in this parameter of the option price and of the corresponding free boundary are derived. These <b>series</b> <b>expansions</b> have the Baroni-Adesi, Whaley solution of the American option pricing problem as zero-th order term. The coefficients of the option price series are explicit formulae. The partial sums of the free boundary series are determined solving numerically nonlinear equations that depend from the time variable as a parameter. Numerical experiments suggest that the <b>series</b> <b>expansions</b> derived are convergent. The evaluation of the truncated <b>series</b> <b>expansions</b> on a grid of values {{of the independent variables}} is easily parallelizable. The cost of computing the n-th order truncated <b>series</b> <b>expansions</b> is approximately proportional to n as n goes to infinity. The results obtained on a set of test problems with the first and second order approximations deduced from the previous <b>series</b> <b>expansions</b> outperform in accuracy and/or in computational cost the results obtained with several alternative methods to solve the American option pricing problem [1]-[3]. For example when we consider options with maturity time between three and ten years and positive cost of carrying parameter (i. e. when the continuous dividend yield is smaller than the risk free interest rate) the second order approximation of the free boundary obtained truncating the <b>series</b> <b>expansions</b> improves substantially the Barone-Adesi, Whaley free boundary [1].
