500|$|Chloe Sullivan was {{introduced}} by the show's creators to be a [...] "Lois Lane archetype", as well as be Smallvilles [...] "outsider", which series developers Gough and Millar felt the show {{needed in order to}} have a character that notices the strange happenings in Smallville. She is the original creation of Al Gough and Miles Miller, having not been produced first in the DC Comics Universe, unlike the other main characters Clark Kent, Lana Lang, Lex Luthor, and Pete Ross. When they first began developing the series, Gough and Millar had intended for Chloe to have an [...] "ethnic background". After learning about Smallville from the show's casting director, Dee Dee Bradley, Allison Mack toyed with the idea of auditioning for the role of Lana Lang, but chose instead to audition for the role of Chloe Sullivan. Gough and Millar felt she had a [...] "rare ability to deliver large chunks of expositionary [...] dialogue conversationally", and decided to cast her against their initial intention to give the character an ethnic origin. According to Mack, the reason she got the role was because she went into her second audition with a [...] "very flippant attitude". Kristen Bell also auditioned for the role of Chloe Sullivan; she would eventually go on to star in the television series Veronica Mars. Aside from Allison Mack, Roan Curtis portrayed Chloe as a child in the season six episode [...] "Progeny", with Victoria Duffield taking on the role in the eighth season episode [...] "Abyss". Mack enjoys the fact that her character was created specifically for the show, because <b>she</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> she does not have to worry about being compared to someone else in the same role, which she likens to people comparing Michael Rosenbaum's performance as Lex Luthor to Gene Hackman's portrayal in the Superman film series of the 1970s – 1980s. Mack only signed on for five episodes of the tenth and final season.|$|E

For the last six years, she’s been tinkering with tracks, leaking some out while experiencing increasing frustration with her label (Interscope). Small wonder the long-aborning Lip Lock appears on her own label. The lag may also explain why we’re hearing a more mature Eve here, less angry, more open to pop." [...] Elias Leight of PopMatters said, [...] "Eve tries to sound current—Lip Lock is consistently dense with electronics that nod to today’s pop-scape. No Neptunes and Dre here, but plenty of low frequency throbbing and high-pitched glitch noises. Eve doesn’t reach for the dance floor often, but this is hip-hop that acknowledges EDM and dub-step. There are a few songs that sound very different from the rest and instantly seem like outliers." ...|$|E

2500|$|In her {{introduction}} to The Womanist Reader, Layli Phillips contends that despite womanism's characterization, its {{main concern is}} not the black woman per se but rather the black woman {{is the point of}} origination for womanism. The basic tenets of womanism includes a strong self-authored spirit of activism that is especially evident in literature. Womanism has been such a polarizing movement for women that it has managed to step outside of the black community and extend itself into other non-white communities. [...] "Purple is to Lavender" [...] illustrates this through experiences that Dimpal Jain and Caroline Turner discuss. Some scholars view womanism as a subcategory of feminism while others argue that it is actually the other way around. Purple is to Lavender explores the concept that womanism is to feminism as purple is to lavender, that feminism falls under the umbrella of womanism. In [...] "Purple is to Lavender", Dimpal Jain and Caroline Turner discuss their experiences as non-white women in faculty. They experienced a great deal of discrimination because they were minorities. Jain is south Asian, while Caroline identifies as Filipino (Jain & Turner, pp.67–70). They go on to describe the concept of [...] "The Politics of Naming" [...] which shapes the reason for why they prefer womanism as opposed to feminism (Jain & Turner, pp.73–75). Jain states: [...] "I knew that the term feminism was contested and that I did not like how it fit in my mouth. It was uncomfortable and scratchy, almost like a foreign substance that I was being forced to consume as the White women continued to smile with comforting looks of familiarity and pride" [...] (Jain & Turner, p.68). Here Turner makes it well known that she feels as though feminism is something that is forced upon her. <b>She</b> <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> she cannot completely identify with feminism. It is also important to note Jain's statement that, [...] "The crux of the politics of naming is that names serve as identifiers and are not neutral when attached to social movements, ideas, and groups of people. Naming and labeling become politicized acts when they serve to determine any type of membership at a group level" [...] (Jain & Turner, p.73). This statement illustrates that if an individual identifies with feminism they may do so for particular reasons. However, those reasons may not be evident to the general public because of the connotation that the word feminism brings with it in terms of social movements, ideas, and groups of people. Individuals want something to identify with that expresses and supports their beliefs holistically. They want something that they can embrace to the fullest without any hint of regret. Similarly, Alice Walker even states: [...] "I don't choose womanism because it is [...] "better" [...] than feminism...I choose it because I prefer the sound, the feel, the fit of it… because I share the old ethnic-American habit of offering society a new word when the old word it is using fails to describe behavior and change that only a new word can help it more fully see" [...] (quoted in Jain & Turner, pp.77–78).|$|E
