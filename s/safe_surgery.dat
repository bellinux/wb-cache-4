40|$|Background: Insulinomas {{are rare}} {{pancreatic}} endocrine tumors. Most are benign and solitary. However, the nonspe-cific symptoms and {{small size of}} these tumors led to difficulties of diagnosis and localization. Case presentation: We present two Arab patients with pancreatic long-standing insulinoma. Both patients pre-sented episodic hypoglycemic symptoms respectively during 10 and 2 years. Biochemical and morphological workup detected localized pancreatic insulinoma. Open procedure surgery was done for the two patients and insulinomas were successfully removed by enucleation. Conclusion: Insulinoma remains a diagnostic challenge to practitioners. Diagnosis of suspected cases is easily confirmed by standard endocrine tests, especially the supervised fasting test.

Such an AR assisted system, with a preoperative CT scan registered and displayed throughout the surgery, would provide the surgeon visibility of the nearby structures surrounding the endoscopes and the tip of the surgical tool. It would help a surgeon to navigate the instrument to the targeted site while avoiding any possible damage to other delicate tissues. It is especially valuable in revised surgery when the normal landmarks may not be present. For these reasons, the proposed system can make a much <b>safer</b> <b>surgery</b> for the patient...|$|R

30|$|The present study, {{among many}} others, was not powered to show {{differences}} in the complication rate. Major complications like bladder injury and vaginal cuff dehiscence occur in about 2 and 1 % of conventional total laparoscopic hysterectomies [6, 15]. A prospective trial with enough patients to show significant {{differences in the}}se complications has to our knowledge never been performed. Our results however do give some indications for <b>safer</b> <b>surgery</b> in the robot TLH group. First, the estimated blood loss is 70  ml lower in the robot TLH group compared to the conventional TLH group. One could argue that 70  ml hardly has any clinical significance, {{but on the other}} hand, it might mean that robot-assisted TLH confers lower operation risks [16]. Also, the lower rehospitalisation and reoperation rates in the robot TLH group suggest that a robot-assisted TLH might convey a lower risk of complications than a conventional TLH.|$|R
40|$|Summary: We {{sought to}} use diffusion-tensor imaging– based tractography {{to assess the}} {{relationship}} between the arteriovenous malformations (AVM) and the sensorimotor cortices/tracts. Three patients who had an AVM closely situated to the sensorimotor tracts were studied. The rela-tionship between the sensorimotor tracts and the AVM was well demonstrated in all patients. Tractography was also helpful in identifying the location of the motor cortex in some of the cases. Surgical management of arteriovenous malforma-tion (AVM) has a high risk when eloquent areas of the brain are involved (1). Therefore, knowing the precise location of these areas and their axonal path-ways would enable <b>safer</b> <b>surgery.</b> Fiber-tracking method is a relatively new neuroimaging technique that visualizes 3 D macroscopic fiber orientation in the brain (2 – 4). We applied this technique to patients with nonhemorrhagic AVMs that were in close prox-imity to the sensorimotor cortices to examine its clin-ical impact...|$|R
