The test helped to build a dataset that will go toward further understanding of the unique acoustic propagation characteristics near the <b>sonic</b> <b>boom</b> <b>carpet</b> extremity. The FaINT was an effort that collected finely-space sonic boom data across the entire lateral cutoff transition region. A major objective of the effort {{was to investigate the}} acoustic phenomena that occur at the audible edge of a <b>sonic</b> <b>boom</b> <b>carpet,</b> including the transition and shadow zones. A NASA F- 18 B aircraft made supersonic passes such that its <b>sonic</b> <b>boom</b> <b>carpet</b> transition zone would intersect a linear 60 -microphone, 7500 -ft long array. A TG- 14 motor glider equipped with a microphone on its wing also attempted to capture the same sonic boom rays that were measured on the ground, at altitudes of 3000 - 6000 ft above ground level. This paper determined an appropriate metric for sonic boom waveforms in the transition and shadow zones called Perceived Sound Exposure Level, and established a value of 65 dB as a limit for the acoustic levels defining the lateral extent of a sonic boom's noise region; analyzed the change in sonic boom levels as a function of distance from flight path both on the ground and 4500 ft above the ground; and compared between sonic boom measurements and numerical predictions...|$|E

40|$|Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company (LM), {{working in}} {{conjunction}} with General Electric Global Research (GE GR) and Stanford University, executed a 19 month program responsive to the NASA sponsored "N+ 2 Supersonic Validation: Advanced Concept Studies for Supersonic Commercial Transports Entering Service in the 2018 - 2020 Period" contract. The key technical objective of this effort was to validate integrated airframe and propulsion technologies and design methodologies necessary to realize a supersonic vehicle capable of meeting the N+ 2 environmental and performance goals. The N+ 2 program is aligned with NASA's Supersonic Project and is focused on providing system level solutions capable of overcoming the efficiency, environmental, and performance barriers to practical supersonic flight. The N+ 2 environmental and performance goals are outlined in the technical paper, AIAA- 2014 - 2138 (Ref. 1) along with the validated N+ 2 Phase 2 results. Our Phase 2 efforts built upon our Phase 1 studies (Ref. 2) and successfully demonstrated the ability to design and test realistic configurations capable of shaped sonic booms over {{the width of the}} <b>sonic</b> <b>boom</b> <b>carpet.</b> Developing a shaped boom configuration capable of meeting the N+ 2 shaped boom targets is a key goal for the N+ 2 program. During the LM Phase 1 effort, LM successfully designed and tested a shaped boom trijet configuration (1021) capable of achieving 85 PLdB under track (forward and aft shock) and up to 28 deg off-track at Mach 1. 6. In Phase 2 we developed a refined configuration (1044 - 2) that extended the under 85 PLdB sonic boom level over the entire carpet of 52 deg off-track at a cruise Mach number of 1. 7. Further, the loudness level of the configuration throughout operational conditions calculates to an average of 79 PLdB. These calculations rely on propagation employing Burger's (sBOOM) rounding methodology, and there are indications that the configuration average loudness would actually be 75 PLdB. We also added significant fidelity to the design of the configuration in this phase by performing a low speed wind tunnel test at our LTWT facility in Palmdale, by more complete modelling of propulsion effects in our sonic boom analysis, and by refining our configuration packaging and performance assessments. Working with General Electric, LM performed an assessment of the impact of inlet and nozzle effects on the sonic boom signature of the LM N+ 2 configurations. Our results indicate that inlet/exhaust streamtube boundary conditions are adequate for conceptual design studies, but realistic propulsion modeling at similar stream-tube conditions does have a small but measurable impact on the sonic boom signature. Previous supersonic transport studies have identified aeroelastic effects as one of the major challenges associated with the long, slender vehicles particularly common with shaped boom aircraft (Ref. 3). Under the Phase 2 effort, we have developed a detailed structural analysis model to evaluate the impact of flexibility and structural considerations on the feasibility of future quiet supersonic transports. We looked in particular at dynamic structural modes and flutter as a failure that must be avoided. We found that for our N+ 2 design in particular, adequate flutter margin existed. Our flutter margin is large enough to cover uncertainties like large increases in engine weight and the margin is relatively easy to increase with additional stiffening mass. The lack of major aeroelastic problems probably derives somewhat from an early design bias. While shaped boom aircraft require long length, they are not required to be thin. We intentionally developed our structural depths to avoid major flexibility problems. So at the end of Phase 2, we have validated that aeroelastic problems are not necessarily endemic to shaped boom designs. Experimental validation of sonic boom design and analysis techniques was the primary objective of the N+ 2 Supersonic Validations contract; and in this Phase, LM participated in four high speed wind tunnel tests. The first so-called Parametric Test in the Ames 9 x 7 tunnel did an exhaustive look at variation effects of the parameters: humidity, total pressure, sample time, spatial averaging distance and number of measurement locations, and more. From the results we learned to obtain data faster and more accurately, and made test condition tolerances easy to meet (eliminating earlier 60 percent wasted time when condition tolerances could not be held). The next two tests used different tunnels. The Ames 11 ft tunnel was used to test lower Mach numbers of 1. 2 and 1. 4. There were several difficulties using this tunnel for the first time for sonic boom including having to shift the measurement Mach numbers to 1. 15 and 1. 3 to avoid flow problems. It is believed that the 11 ft could be used successfully to measure sonic boom but there are likely to be a number of test condition restrictions. The Glenn 8 x 6 ft tunnel was used next and the tunnel has a number of desirable features for sonic boom measurement. While the Ames 9 x 7 can only test Mach 1. 55 to 2. 55 and the 11 ft can only test Mach 1. 3 and lower, the Glenn 8 x 6 can test continuously from Mach 0. 3 to 2. 0. Unfortunately test measurement accuracy was compromised by a reference pressure drift. Post-test analysis revealed that the drift occurred when Mach number drifted slightly. Test measurements indicated that if Mach number drift is eliminated, results from the 8 x 6 would be more accurate, especially at longer distances, than results from the 9 x 7. The fourth test in the 9 x 7, called LM 4, used everything we learned to comprehensively and accurately measure our new 1044 - 02 configuration with a full-carpet shaped signature design. Productivity was 8 times greater than our Phase 1 LM 3 test. Measurement accuracy and repeatability was excellent out to 42 in. However, measurements at greater distances require the rail in the aft position and become substantially less accurate. Further signature processing or measurement improvements are needed for beyond near-field signature validation...|$|E

40|$|A finite-difference {{numerical}} {{method for}} geometrical shock dynamics has been developed, {{based on the}} analogy between the equations and the supersonic potential equation. The method {{has proven to be}} a valuable tool for analyzing the complex nonlinear processes that occur in shock focusing. The approximate shock dynamics theory is able to capture the effects of initial Mach number and aperture angle on the focal region. The numerical results duplicate the strong, moderate, and weak shock behaviors observed in experiments, with good agreement for focal pressure and triple-point path. The primary error arises due to the inability of shock dynamics to allow regular reflection along the centerline. Adequate resolution of the focal region proves to be particularly important to properly judge the accuracy of the shock dynamics solution. The appropriate shock dynamics equations are developed for the case of shock propagation into a nonuniform media for a general equation of state with nonuniform freestream velocity. The modification of the numerical method to this more general problem is straightforward. The complete shock dynamics equations are derived for both perfect gas and water using the modified Tait equation. The results for propagation of a planar shock over cylindrical gas inhomogeneities shows excellent agreement with experimental results. The propagation of <b>sonic</b> <b>booms</b> through the atmosphere provides examples of all major types of weak shock behavior.

5000|$|The {{sound of}} a <b>sonic</b> <b>boom</b> depends largely on the {{distance}} between the observer and the aircraft shape producing the <b>sonic</b> <b>boom.</b> A <b>sonic</b> <b>boom</b> is usually heard as a deep double [...] "boom" [...] as the aircraft is usually some distance away.

40|$|INTRODUCTION An {{important}} {{objective of}} the NASA High-Speed Research Program (HSRP) is development of a technology base for future high-speed civil transport aircraft (HSCT).

50|$|The energy {{range of}} <b>sonic</b> <b>boom</b> is {{concentrated}} in the 0.1-100 hertz frequency range that is considerably below that of subsonic aircraft, gunfire and most industrial noise. Duration of <b>sonic</b> <b>boom</b> is brief; less than a second, 100 milliseconds (0.1 second) for most fighter-sized aircraft and 500 milliseconds for the space shuttle or Concorde jetliner. The intensity and width of a <b>sonic</b> <b>boom</b> path depends on the physical characteristics of the aircraft {{and how it is}} operated. In general, the greater an aircraft's altitude, the lower the overpressure on the ground. Greater altitude also increases the boom's lateral spread, exposing a wider area to the boom. Overpressures in the <b>sonic</b> <b>boom</b> impact area, however, will not be uniform. Boom intensity is greatest directly under the flight path, progressively weakening with greater horizontal distance away from the aircraft flight track. Ground width of the boom exposure area is approximately 1 smi km for each 1000 ft of altitude (the width is about five times the altitude); that is, an aircraft flying supersonic at 30000 ft will create a lateral boom spread of about 30 mi. For steady supersonic flight, the boom is described as a <b>carpet</b> <b>boom</b> since it moves with the aircraft as it maintains supersonic speed and altitude. Some manoeuvers, diving, acceleration or turning, can cause focusing of the boom. Other manoeuvers, such as deceleration and climbing, can reduce the strength of the shock.

40|$|The {{versatility}} of High Speed Civil Transports (HSCT) will be operationally {{limited by}} regulations that prohibit overland supersonic flight.
