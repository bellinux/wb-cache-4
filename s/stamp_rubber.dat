50|$|As <b>rubber</b> <b>stamping</b> {{increasingly}} gains popularity, {{mostly in}} the United States, it also gains a reputation as an art form.

Companies like Speedball or MasterCarve supply carving sets to amateurs wishing to carve their own <b>rubber</b> <b>stamps,</b> with some including linocut tools. The print from the carved <b>rubber</b> <b>stamp</b> is viewed as work of art on its own, or one or more stamps are used to embellish {{a work of art}} with other components.|$|R

Although {{nowadays}} {{there are}} working systems for sorting mail in some constrained ways, segmenting gray level images of envelopes and locating address blocks in them {{is still a}} difficult problem. Pattern Recognition research has contributed greatly to this area since the problem concerns feature design, extraction, recognition, and also the image segmentation if one deals with the original gray level images from the beginning. This paper presents a segmentation and address block location algorithm based on feature selection in wavelet space.

Also they necessitate delays. The other day I had occasion to go to Moscow, and I learnt that it takes three weeks to get a visa for Finland and three weeks to get a visa for Esthonia.

The preparations for a little journey to Russia the other day took three whole days out of my life, cost me several pounds in stamps and fees, and five in bribery.|$|R

5000|$|A {{notary seal}} of the <b>rubber</b> <b>stamp</b> type is {{required}} to be affixed to all notarized paper documents. The <b>rubber</b> <b>stamp</b> must include the commissioned name of the notary public, the words [...] "Notary Public-State of Florida", the notary's commission number, and the date on which the notary's commission expires. Prior to the mid-1970s, the only statutory requirement regarding notarial seals was that one be used and that it include the words [...] "Notary Public" [...] and [...] "State of Florida at Large"; {{the name of the}} notary was optional, and the law did not specify what types of seals were permissible. This law was later amended to state that the seal must be round in design and of either the <b>rubber</b> <b>stamp</b> or impression type. In the early 1990s, the statute was again changed to require a <b>rubber</b> <b>stamp</b> seal, with an impression type seal being optional and not acceptable unless used in conjunction with a <b>rubber</b> <b>stamp.</b> However, many notaries continue to use the impression seal with their <b>rubber</b> <b>stamp</b> to allow for easy detection when trying to determine which document is an original. This process is made more difficult for notaries who only use a <b>rubber</b> <b>stamp</b> seal, as the Florida statutes require that the seal be affixed in only photographically-reproducible black ink.|$|R

5000|$|But {{instead of}} a mind, {{universal}} literacy has given common man a <b>rubber</b> <b>stamp,</b> a <b>rubber</b> <b>stamp</b> inked with advertising slogans, with editorials, with published scientific data, with the trivialities of tabloids and the profundities of history, but quite innocent of original thought. Each man’s <b>rubber</b> <b>stamp</b> is the twin of millions of others, so that when these millions {{are exposed to the}} same stimuli, all receive identical imprints. … The amazing readiness with which large masses accept this process is probably accounted for by the fact that no attempt is made to convince them that black is white. Instead, their preconceived hazy ideas that a certain gray is almost black or almost white are brought into sharper focus. Their prejudices, notions, and convictions are used as a starting point, with the result that they are drawn by a thread into passionate adherence to a given mental picture.|$|R

40|$|Although {{nowadays}} {{there are}} working systems for sorting mail in some constraint ways, segmenting gray level images of envelopes {{is still a}} difficult problem. This paper presents a learning-based approach for address block segmentation in postal envelopes. The method consists in learning to segment correctly submitting both an image and its ideal version. From this stage, for each pixel and each gray level, it is generated a feature vector and built a classification array re-utilized {{at the moment of}} new image segmentation. Features used in this approach are: pixel gray level, mean, variance, skewness and kurtosis calculated within an adaptive square neighbor. The new image is segmented by means of k-Nearest Neighbor that seeks, for each pixel, the best solution in the classification array. Performed tests were validated using a pixel to pixel accuracy measure over a ground truth database of 200 images of complex postal envelopes. Results were compared to other prior approaches for the same database. Success rates achieved for address block, <b>stamps,</b> <b>rubber</b> <b>stamps</b> and noise suggest that the features used in the proposed approach improves the segmentation results...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a learning-based approach to segment postal address blocks where the learning step uses only {{one pair of}} images (a sample image and its ideal segmented solution). First, this approach learns the available knowledge among pixels (each gray level) in an input image and its corresponding output in the ideal segmented solution. A classification array is generated which is re-utilized during the segmentation of new images. Features are extracted and updated {{by means of an}} adaptive square neighborhood. At the moment of new image segmentation, the submitted images are segmented by means of a k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithm that seeks, for each pixel, the best solution in the classification array. Tests on a database of 200 complex envelope images were performed and a pixel to pixel accuracy measure validates the new approach. Results compared to other approaches for the same database show the efficiency and performance of the proposed learning-based approach.
