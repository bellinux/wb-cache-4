40|$|With {{the general}} decree of waste water taking effect on September 8 "t"h 1989 the minimum {{requirements}} for {{waste water treatment}} has risen. That applies equally for the degradation of carbon, nitrogen and phosporus compounds. With {{the introduction of the}} 2 h-sample and the grab sample the process stability of waste water treatment plants becomes more and more important, as well as the impact of shock loadings to treatment stability. This paper is mainly about the effects caused by carbon loadings and nitrogen loadings on activated sludge plants. The investigations are accomplished with domestic waste water on pilot plant scale and are supplemented by microscopic analysis and mathematical simulations. The document starts with the definition of the term shock loading. <b>Sewer</b> <b>cleaning,</b> flow of combined sewers, sludge liquor and liquid manure discharges have been identified as the origin for shock loadings during the investigations. Solid matter loadings caused by <b>sewer</b> <b>cleaning,</b> sludge liquor and liquid manure discharges could already been retended in the primary settling basin. The primary settling tank of the examined waste water treatment plants were larger designed than necessary. the best efficiency with regards to COD, TKN and P_g_e_s has been reached with detention times of one to two hours. Checks of the parameters f_C and f_N, which are necessary for the dimensioning of the areation installations, showed that in the examined waste water treatment plants the resulting factors with regards to f_C exceeded the value recommended in the German ATV Standard A 131. The experiments with shock loadings on a pilot scale plant showed that carbon loadings in opposition to nitrogen loadings did not result in an exceeding of final effluent values. The deterioration of treatment efficiency depends on time and duration of ammonia loadings. The mathematical simulation of shock loadings has proofed to be an adequate tool to determine the limits of performance of waste water treatment plants. This is especially true for nitrogen loadings.

40|$|Sewage {{systems are}} crucial to reduce the risks of water borne {{diseases}} and avoid flooding of cities. Cleaning processes are thus highly important to avoid health risks and environmental, economic and societal impacts which {{can be caused by}} damaged or blocked sewerage. Sewer networks must therefore not only be kept clean, they also have to be continuously inspected in order to detect structural damages, pipe deterioration and construction failures in order to avoid local city floods, backflow into basements, traffic disturbances, street and surface erosion, and pollution of ground water and local receiving waters. Hence, if the sewerage is damaged or blocked, there is a significant environmental, social and public health risk. During the cleaning process, high amounts of water are used to clean the pipes regardless of the real cleaning demands. Hence, there is a high need to develop a system integrating a reliable inspection tool which efficiently varies the cleaning process according to the real demand. The PIPEGUARD system is about the development of an all in one system for the maintenance of pipes and sewage systems. It can detect the degree of pollution and damages in sewage pipes with ultrasound and clean them only if necessary. The geographic location of the pipe will be also mapped in real-time via an inertial navigation system to allocate detected damages to their position and to obtain reliable position mapping for the creation of 3 D network maps. This will lead into an advanced <b>sewer</b> <b>cleaning</b> management and contributing to an improvement of its overall state, as a result of modifying the periodicity of cleaning and optimizing maintenance costs depending on network characteristics and needs...|$|E

40|$|The {{growth of}} population, {{cities and towns}} {{all over the world}} usually results in the {{over-exploitation}} of resources and increased pollution. Water service providers (WSPs) are required to provide adequate sanitation to the community, taking into consideration technical, social, economic and environmental issues. Therefore, WSPs are faced with increasingly complex objectives and demands when making decisions related to asset investment. Sewer systems handle two types of water that require drainage: (sanitary) wastewater and stormwater. These two types of water typically convey different classes of solids into the system. The presence of these solids which include sediment in systems causes operational problems: loss of hydraulic capacity, in-pipe septicity and contribute to the pollutants in foul flushes. This leads to significant economic and environmental impact on stakeholders and the area into which storm water is discharged. This paper demonstrates a wide variety of effective strategies for addressing sewer sediment management to improve existing infrastructure and develop new systems using hydraulic modelling and life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. Sediment management generally relies on low technology practices that are applied by individuals, municipalities and industrial establishments. In the UK the current practices to control sediment in urban drainage catchments entail street, gully and <b>sewer</b> <b>cleaning.</b> Other techniques like (e. g. sediment traps, flushing tanks and flushing gates) have been considered elsewhere as an effective method of controlling sediment deposition in the sewer provided regular cleansing and maintenance are carried out (Ashley et al, 2004). There are six options being considered for the management of sewer sediment for this study. The first two are to control the solids entering the sewer system, three options are considering managing the sediment in the sewers and the final option is to manage the sediment {{at the end of the}} pipe at the wastewater treatment plant (WTP). The study has calculated the mass flow analysis (MFA) of solids that enter the sewer system using detailed hydraulic modelling. The dynamic model provides inputs needed by other components of the study in describing the life cycle assessment of sediment management options in sewer systems using life cycle assessment via the SimaPro software. The LCA goal of the reported study is to evaluate the energy use, resource consumption, pollutant emissions and the consequent environmental impacts of alternative solids management scenarios. ...|$|E
40|$|In Germany the {{cleaning}} of sewers takes place predominantly {{with the high}} pressure cleaning (jetting). Since {{the beginnings of the}} jetting 50 years ago the machine and instrument technique of this procedure was improved significantly. On the other hand operating strategies changed hardly until today. Nowadays, jetting is still applied according to the so called system cleaning in most cases. Starting from the initial reaches and ending at the waste water treatment plant this procedure cleans sewer systems gradually in cycles of months or years. A contemporary and area-wide removal of deposits is not possible with that discontinuously and punctually practiced cleaning method. An appreciable reduction or prevention of shocks of pollution load on storm water overflow discharge and waste water treatment in combined sewer systems caused of deposit cannot be achieved, since a reformation of deposit is probable within a few days or weeks by using the conventional cleaning procedure. Also unsoiled reaches are cleaned because neither control of cleaning performance nor an assessment of demand for attend measures is carried through in advance. In addition increasingly damage to fittings and channel walls are deplored due to high compression stresses as well as due to inappropriate application. A proper cleaning of sewer systems cannot be attained therefore with the form of the jetting practiced today any more. On purpose of an effective water pollution control and for the improvement of the operational situation therefore the anyway high financial expenses for <b>sewer</b> <b>cleaning</b> are either to be increased and/or changes of {{the cleaning}} strategies and/or the choice of cleaning methods are necessary. In context of the available thesis it was therefore examined whether an improvement of the current situation can be achieved by sewer flushing which is common {{for a long time and}} was enhanced during the last years. Following extensive laboratory experiments, field studies and mathematical-numerical simulations were accomplished. The laboratory experiments showed that also small flushing waves cause a significant resuspension of settled particles and can therefore be used successfully in the framework of flushing measures. The results of the field studies clarify that flushing devices can cause both a basic and a preventive cleaning of sewers within certain boundary conditions. Varying hydraulic and structural boundary conditions cleaning performance of flushing waves was determined by one-dimensional flow models. The average bottom shear-stress served as criterion for the determination of flushing lengths. Basing on the results of these investigations a planning procedure for the flushing was developed. It permits a problem-specific planning of flushing measures for successful cleaning of sewers on a long term basis. The economic advantages of the flushing in relation to the jetting became apparent in context of a consideration of costs including the different cleaning qualities of the two methods. Today the flushing is an alternative for cleaning of sewers and sewer systems. Sewers can be kept in durably deposit-free, lasting improvements on water pollution control as well as on operation and maintenance of sewers and treatment plants can be obtained by a quasi-continuous application of flushing devices...|$|E

40|$|Robots {{have been}} used in {{laboratories}} and factories for many years, but their uses are changing fast. Since the turn of the century, sales of professional and personal service robots have risen sharply and are estimated to total ~ 5. 5 million in 2008. This number, which far outstrips the 1 million operational industrial robots on the planet, is estimated to reach 11. 5 million by 2011 (1).

Two main areas of potential ethical risk are considered here: the care of children and the elderly, and the development of autonomous robot weapons by the military. The widespread availability of service robots has resulted from several developments that allowed robots to become mobile, interactive machines.

40|$|Data from call centres at two {{municipalities}} were analysed {{in order}} to quantify flooding frequencies and associated flood risks for three main failure mechanisms causing urban flooding. The aim was {{to find out whether}} current operational strategies are efficient for flood prevention and if directions for improvement could be found. The results show that quantified flood risk for the two cases is well above the standard which is defined in sewer management plans. The analysis pointed out that gully pot blockages are the main cause of flooding and handling gully pot blockages should therefore be a priority for sewer operators. Reactive handling of calls, as is currently applied, is inefficient if all calls are reacted upon since a small portion of all calls report serious consequences like flooding in buildings or wastewater flooding. Preventive <b>cleaning</b> of <b>sewer</b> pipes proves to be an efficient strategy to reduce flooding due to sewer blockages as flood risk associated with sewer blockages is lower in case of higher <b>cleaning</b> <b>sewer</b> frequencies. Sewer blockages often have serious consequences, thus preventive handling is to be preferred to reactive cleaning.

40|$|This study aims at {{developing}} {{a model to}} estimate flood damage cost caused in Gonaives, Haiti by Hurricane Jeanne in 2004. In order to reach this goal, the influence of income, inundation duration and inundation depth, slope, population density and distance to major roads on the loss costs was investigated. Surveyed {{data were analyzed using}} Excel and ArcGIS 10 software. The ordinary least square and the geographically weighted regression analyses were used to predict flood damage costs. Then, the estimates were delineated using voronoi geostatistical map tool. As a result, the factors account for the costs as high as 83 %. The flood damage cost in a household varies between 24, 315 through 37, 693 Haitian Gourdes (approximately 607. 875 through 942. 325 U. S. Dollars). Severe damages were spotted in the urban area and in the rural section of Bassin whereas very low and low losses are essentially found in Labranle. The urban area was more severely affected by comparison with the rural area. Damages in the urban area are estimated at 41, 206, 869. 57 USD against 698, 222, 174. 10 17, 455, 554. 35 USD in the rural area. In the urban part, damages were more severe in Raboteau-JubilÃ©e and in Downtown but Bigot-Parc Vincent had the highest overall damage cost estimated at 9, 729, 368. 95 USD. The lowest cost 7, 602, 040. 42 USD was recorded in Raboteau. Approximately, 39. 38 % of the rural area underwent very low to moderate damages. Bassin was the most severely struck by the 2004 floods, but Bayonnais turned out to have the highest loss cost: 4, 988, 487. 66 USD. Bassin along with Labranle had the least damage cost, 2, 956, 131. 11 and 2, 268, 321. 41 USD respectively. Based on the findings, we recommended the implementation and diversification of income-generating activities, the maintenance and improvement of drains, <b>sewers</b> and gullies <b>cleaning</b> and the establishment of conservation practices upstream of the watersheds. In addition, the model should be applied and validated using actual official records as reference data.

40|$|Toxoplasmosis, {{caused by}} Toxoplasma gondii, has {{traditionally}} been considered an important water and foodborne protozoonosis with important public health considerations. Although felids play a well-established role as definitive hosts, canine epidemiological involvement in the parasite's life cycle remains questionable and controversial. The increasing closeness of the human-dog bond, particularly seen in urban settings, has been recognized as a historically unprecedented worldwide movement. Sharing daily lives in the same households, dogs may be exposed to similar associated risks of T. gondii infection as their owners. Thus, epidemiological assessment of the intra-domiciled environment, especially among socio-economically different human populations, may provide novel information regarding the actual role of dogs in animal and human toxoplasmosis. Despite spatial approaches being recently used for other water and foodborne diseases, no study has been conducted on the simultaneous spatial seroprevalence of both human and animal IgG anti-T. gondii antibodies in urban areas of major cities. Accordingly, {{the aim of the}} present study was to assess the seroprevalence and associated variables of Toxoplasma infection in owners and their domiciled dogs in Londrina, southern Brazil. Human and canine seroprevalence rates and variables associated with seroprevalence were investigated through representative random sampling among 564 households, which included 597 owners and 729 dogs. Overall, statistically significant differences between the seroprevalence of human and dog anti-T. gondii antibodies were found by Immunofluorescence Antibody Testing in 248 / 597 (41. 54 %) owners and 119 / 729 (16. 32 %) dogs. Through multiple analysis, significant concomitant variables for seropositivity of household individuals (people and dogs) were determined, including public <b>sewer</b> service, yard <b>cleaning</b> frequency, and having a dirty yard. Although no statistically significant multiple logistic model was observed among owners, univariate analysis detected associations with monthly income, soil contact, and occupation. Among dogs, the absence of other dogs and the absence of a dirty yard were concomitant significantly protective associated factors. Age differences between seropositive and seronegative individuals was significant only for human beings, with the median age of negative individuals significantly higher than positive individuals. Although no spatial clusters were identified for humans or residences, a significant cluster was identified for dogs. In conclusion, characteristics of urban toxoplasmosis may include significantly higher owner seroprevalence than their owned dogs, with canine seroprevalence directly associated with having more dogs and a dirty backyard, and spatial differences in both human and dog exposures. Although not a good indicator for human foodborne diseases, dogs may be a reliable sentinel for environmental infection. Moreover, such a holistic approach may provide crucial information for more focused prevention and monitoring programs, particularly in households with multiple pets and trash-filled backyards...|$|R
