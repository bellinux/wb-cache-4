Once pipelines are damaged, a series of problems will be produced, which has negative effects on society, economy, and environment [4]. Therefore, how to connect pipelines reliably as well as related equipment in setting up a subsea oil-gas production system and pipeline repair is a big challenge.

40|$|Drilling riser {{systems are}} {{subjected}} to hydrodynamic loads from vessel motions, waves, steady currents and vortex-induced motions. This necessitates a proper structural analysis during the design phase using techniques such as finite element analysis (FEA). Common approaches within the FEA packages approximate the individual components including BOP/LMRP (Blow-Out Preventer/Lower Marine Riser Package), <b>subsea</b> <b>tree</b> and wellhead using 2 D or 3 D beam/pipe elements with approximated effective mass and damping coefficients. Predicted system response can be very sensitive to the mass, hydrodynamic added mass and drag of the large LMRP/BOP/Tree components above the wellhead. In the past, gross conservative estimates on the hydrodynamic coefficients were made and despite this, design criteria were generally met. With the advent of large sixth-generation BOP stacks {{with the possibility of}} additional capping stacks, such approximations are no longer acceptable. Therefore, the possibility of relying on the more detailed capability of computational fluid-structure interaction (FSI) analysis for a better calculation of these coefficients is investigated.

40|$|This master {{thesis is}} done in {{collaboration}} with Aker Solutions Subsea AS and proposes how one could securely cope with uncontrolled drift-off where the marine riser experience excessive moments and/or tension that will damage the well integrity and structure while the well is undergoing workover or intervention. This weak link design is meant to release the riser from the well structure before damage occurs, either when excessive moments, tension or both {{have the potential to}} damage the structure. The release mechanism should work as a 3 rd barrier, and by itself, with no input from the operator, make the riser disconnect safely. The mechanism should also secure the well so that the surface vessel can safely drift-off from position. The preliminary study project, which was finished in December 2010, produced several interesting concepts. One was chosen for further study and analysis in the master thesis by the candidate, Aker Solutions representatives and the supervisor from NTNU. In this thesis, the concept has been further developed, analyzed and dimensioned to cope with relevant example and extreme loading conditions provided by Aker Solutions Subsea AS. The concept developed in this thesis is based on an idea of a standard ANSI flanged connection. By using pressurized CO 2, the flange geometry produces a separation pressure which forces the flange bolts to break, thus separating the riser connection and disrupting the communication between the surface vessel and the subsea equipment. The system is initiated by a battery powered offset monitoring system which measures the riser offset at a position 55 meters above the EDP. When the separation has been initiated, the hydraulic pressure and control signal connection between the operator and the subsea well is terminated, thus closing the wellbore by utilization of the failsafe valves in the <b>subsea</b> <b>tree</b> and/or well control package. Analyses of the final concept in Abaqus show that the dimensions and geometry copes well with the applied loading condition. The weak link bolts are designed to break if subjected to a limited tension force. This enables the present weak link to be applied as a replacement for existing links which are solely based on tension response. </p...|$|E

40|$|BP Norway is {{well versed}} in well {{intervention}} from fixed platforms. The present Skarv field development will however require future subsea well interventions to take place from different floating vessels. BP has extensive experience from subsea fields outside of Norway, and {{it is necessary to}} ensure that the planning and preparations for such activities in Norway are fully up to speed with company competence. This thesis seeks to act as reference work for anyone interested in learning about subsea well intervention in BP Norway, but should not be mistaken for purely theoretical work. The overall goal is to assess how future subsea well intervention operations on Skarv can be performed, optimised and incorporate all BP learning from previous operations in the North Sea, thus contribute to increased hydrocarbon recovery from the Norwegian continental shelf. In order to properly prepare the well intervention department and management systems for the coming challenges, a broad definition of subsea intervention practices, technology and experiences have been described. Subsea wells are expensive to intervene with conventional rigs so the more cost-effective Light Well Intervention (LWI) alternative has been selected as a focus area. Even LWI vessels are expensive machinery so malpractices during operational execution may compromise the good economics of well interventions. The in depth study is focused on experienced unplanned events causing delays or non-productive time (NPT) during operations and thereby reducing operational efficiency. A powerful tool to increase the operation factor (uptime vs. downtime) and economics of subsea interventions is to proactively apply risk management techniques, hence this subject is also incorporated in the in depth study. The thesis is operationally orientated and a wide range of real data has been analysed, including but not limited to operational daily reports, end of well reports, after action reviews, risk assessments, operational guidelines, procedures, practices and investigation reports. The BP advisory team was consistently involved in the process and in addition to analysing documents, expert interviews were conducted. The analysis is by reasoning of the above concentrated on all operations conducted from the three LWI vessels BP had in operation in the North Sea in the time period 2009 - 2011. One of the most important findings is that around 80 % of all lessons learnt stems from ?Planning?, ?Equipment? or ?Operations?, suggesting this should be the main arena for organisational learning focus and future improvement efforts. Among a number of comparable reports, the following example from the LWI vessel Island Constructor operating on the Devenick field in 2011 has helped in narrowing down one of the key causes behind the high number of incidents within the ?Equipment? and ?Operations? categories to interface clashes: ?Unable to land off tree running tool on the <b>subsea</b> <b>tree</b> due to interface issues between the hydraulic couplers. Various attempts to land the tree running tool anyway lead to wear on equipment and 3 coupler shrouds came free. ? Several similar underlying causes have been identified based on commonalities found when cross referencing all the subsea intervention operational lessons for different phases including ?Planning?, ?Rig Up?, ?Personnel?, ?Communication? and ?Miscellaneous? in addition to the above mentioned categories. Some of the documented lessons learnt are repeated at other vessels later in time, questioning the ability to actually benefit from recording these lessons. A recommended risk assessment template has been established in order to assist focus for future planning of similar operations in Norwegian waters. Implementation of the template will improve operational efficiency, reduce unwanted downtime and make BP among the ?best in class? when it comes to practical risk management and organisational learning within subsea LWI operations. Further work should be done to include an even more comprehensive data study to uncover trends that might have gone under the radar. Further work should also focus on providing an effective permanent organisational learning platform to ensure unwanted events do not repeat themselves and that all relevant lessons learnt are indeed incorporated in future operations {{to be able to take}} full advantage of previous successes and failures. All BP experiences should be gathered and processed to get a total experience and risk data bank for these operations. Recommended measures from the risk register should be transformed to updated programmes and procedures. Further work should also seek implementation of the new recommended risk register approach proposed in this thesis for subsea well interventions in the BP organisation...|$|E
40|$|In recent times, {{the oil and}} gas {{business}} has moved into unconventional reservoirs, especially in deep-water. One high-potential prospect was found in the deep-water area of Myanmar. A subsea production system pilot project is planned for implementation in this area. One essential element of a subsea system is a “subsea jumper”. The main function is to interface between the <b>subsea</b> <b>tree</b> and subsea manifold. There are various subsea jumper configurations used in the market. This thesis focuses primarily on the U-inverse shape jumper as a fundamental shape which gives subsea jumper a flexible characteristic. A subsea jumper that is used in a deep-water area is difficult to access for maintenance or repair. As such, it is essential to determine the reliability of a jumper system, especially thru fatigue failure analysis. The dynamic behaviors of a subsea jumper at various load conditions need {{to be taken into account}} during the design phase. In general, a subsea jumper system experiences many loads both internal and external, but there are only two key external loads, the steady sea current and earthquakes at designed area. These interesting factors are considered in this thesis. In order to be better understand the dynamic behaviors of a subsea jumper under load conditions, it is important to first analyze the dynamic characteristics of the jumper itself. A U-inverse shape jumper can be modelled by connecting three “pipe conveying fluid model” (or Euler Bernoulli Beam + internal flow effect). This is called a “subsea jumper model” or “Triple beam model”. This model gives the dynamic characteristics of a jumper in terms of “mode shape” and “natural frequency” in two vibration planes: inline and crossflow. The dynamic behavior of a subsea jumper under a current load situation can be solved by using a wake oscillator model coupled with a subsea jumper model. The results show that a mild sea current is able to dramatically induce jumper oscillation. This phenomenon is called Vortex induced vibration (VIV). It can occur in both crossflow VIV and inline VIV; however, for both cases of VIV, a subsea jumper system is safe to operate under the designed current velocity (maximum current velocity is 0. 832 m/s, based on a 100 -year return value). In an earthquake load condition, the subsea jumper model is coupled with an inertia load model (mass times acceleration). Two types of acceleration are considered in this thesis thru a sinusoidal model and simulation model. The first, sinusoidal model assumes that an earthquake is a continuous process with ground acceleration in a sinusoidal shape. It is used to analyze the dynamic behavior of a subsea jumper in terms of “seismic response spectra”. The second, a simulation model defines an earthquake in more realistic way by considering an earthquake as a shock of high magnitude in a small period. This model is more suitable for fatigue analysis. It should be emphasized that a pure earthquake load is a rare occasion, as the current of the nearby seabed is always present. Thus, it is more helpful to investigate the fatigue lifetime of a jumper under a combination of earthquake effects and steady current. The analysis results show that a subsea jumper can withstand up to 13, 000 number of a high magnitude earthquake shock, over 7. 5 Richter. However, during the designed lifetime of a subsea jumper there are typically only 600 shocks. Thus, one can conclude that a subsea jumper is safe against earthquakes in the designed area. The designed subsea jumper may require changes if it is relocated to operate in another area with the presence of a stronger current velocity and/or earthquake conditions. Subsea jumper lifetime can be improved by designing dimensions and configurations to give natural frequencies out of the load range. This can be achieved by reducing the length of a jumper or increasing its diameter. Another method is to reduce the flow rate of the contained fluid. However, these methods may stimulate another problem if slug is present inside the jumper. Adjustments in flow rate or jumper dimension changes the impact period of slug at each bend of a jumper system. When slug impact load frequency is close to a natural frequency, there will be a dramatic response. Thus, considerations of slug should be taken into account for subsea jumper design, especially with any changes in dimension, configuration and flow rate. Lastly, other mitigation methods include a more robust material, controlling surface conditions and welding method. Offshore engineeringHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

The inner, vertical wall of the cylinder was fixed at a high temperature whereas the outer cylinder wall was fixed at 4 degrees Celsius. Different cases were investigated, with {{the temperature of the}} inner cylinder wall varying from 50 to 100 degrees Celsius. The upper and lower walls were insulated. The analytical solution was based on four literature correlations, each estimating a Nusselt number that was used to compute the respective heat flux and heat transfer coefficient in each case, for comparison with the numerical results. Two of the correlations were based on rectangular enclosures, while the other two were based on vertical concentric cylinders. Numerical results were obtained with two models: 1) a simplified model with an effective thermal conductivity and 2) a fully resolved model taking into account the free convection effects. The simplified model based its effective thermal conductivity on the Nusselt numbers obtained from the literature correlations. A 2 D and a 3 D model were developed, tested and compared. For the simplified model based on conduction, the 2 D and 3 D model estimated approximately the same heat flux values as expected. The fully resolved 2 D and 3 D model differed with up to 20 % for a inner wall temperature of 100 degrees Celsius.

Due to the shift to deeper waters, subsea production system (SPS) {{has come to be}} a preferred technology with attendant economic benefits. At the centre of the SPS is the subsea control module (SCM), responsible for the proper functioning and monitoring of the entire system. With increasing search for hydrocarbons in deep and ultra-deepwaters, the SCM system faces important environmental, safety and reliability challenges and little research has been done in this area. Analysis of the SCM reliability then becomes very fundamental due to the huge cost associated with failure. Several tools are available for this analysis, but the FMECA stands out due to its ability to not only provide failure data, but also showcase the system’s failure modes and mechanisms associated with the subsystems and components being evaluated. However, the technique has been heavily challenged in various literatures for several reasons. To close this gap, a novel multi-criteria approach is developed for the analysis and ranking of the SCM failures modes. This research specifically focusses on subsea tree-mounted electro-hydraulic (E-H) SCM responsible for the underwater control of oil and gas production. A risk identification of the subsea control module is conducted using industry experts. This is followed by a comprehensive component based FMECA analysis of the SCM conducted with the conventional RPN technique, which reveals the most critical failure modes for the SCM.

In collaboration with FMC Technologies a solution to the problem has been developed for measuring the remaining hydraulic oil inside the tank, where a measuring system were put on the top of the accumulator tank protected by a housing. The critical issue for the system is an expected lifetime of 25 years. Several solution regarding a measuring system where proposed.

40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore TechnologyThe light well {{intervention}} for subsea wells using riserless method {{has been carried}} out extensively over the last 10 years to increase the oil and gas recovery from depleted wells. Riserless Light Well Intervention (RLWI) is a relatively new technology {{that can be used to}} replace the majority of the well interventions previously done from semisubmersible rigs. RLWI performs subsea well intervention without using a drilling riser package and a subsea BOP. Alternatively, the Well Control Package (WCP) will be installed on top of <b>subsea</b> Xmas <b>Tree</b> as a barrier replacing BOP and then downhole tools can be deployed into the subsea well utilizing wireline from intervention vessel. The RLWI method is expected to reduce the cost and time in performing well intervention compared to conventional method. But when it comes to lowering down the downhole tool, it has a major issue regarding the accuracy in determining the operational well depth for “in well” work. During RLWI operation in deep water, the environmental conditions will have much influence to the wireline part that is suspended in open water. It is found very difficult to measure part of the cable length that has been submerged into the well since it depends on the “deflection shape” of the cable after it get exposed to the varying sea current from surface to sea bottom. The environmental load from sea current acting along the cable length will be transformed into uplift force on the other end of the cable inside the well. The combination of vertical displacement in upward direction due to uplift force and in downward direction due to cable stretch will affect the accuracy of the well depth measurement and position control of the downhole tool. Depth accuracy is very crucial in performing work inside the well. This project will study the cable behavior under prevailing dynamic sea environment for RLWI wireline operation in North Sea and will present one approach to correct inaccuracy in determining the exact location of the downhole tool inside the well from marine perspective. The study case was taken from Aasta Hansteen field with 1300 meters water depth in particular. OrcaFlex software will be utilized to perform static and dynamic analysis of the wireline cable under sea current and wave effect. OrcaFlex was developed by Orcina to support a wide range of hydrodynamic and marine structural analysis, including modeling the cable under sea current. During the analysis, the wireline behavior under currents will be observed for different operational well depth cases. The analysis results obtained from OrcaFlex simulations are vertical displacements and forces acting upon the wireline. Then recommended measures are discussed in this thesis to maximize the accuracy during “in well” work with different types of downhole tool weight. In addition, this thesis will also discuss the latest technologies of light well intervention, such as well control equipments used nowadays in RLWI operations...|$|R

The tool has been developed as a sequence of organized APDL macros with a layout to grant general applicability to the tool. This circumstance implies that different structure can be processed with the tool without any changes in its structure and in its core functionalities. All of the customization operations required {{for the application of}} the tool on a specific structure result simple and quick to carry out, in particular if compared with the time needed for the definition of a tool for the preliminary assessment and weight optimization dedicated for a specific structure. The tool needs, as input, simplified representations of frames, and performs linear elastic structural assessments on the resultant FE model. All of the choices regarding the properties of the geometrical model and the type of analysis performed by the tool are in line with its intended purposes. The definition of the simplification procedure needed for the building up of the geometrical model of the frame has been carried out as integral part of the work. Once defined, the tool has been tested on two different XT frames. For each of these, detailed structural assessment results are already available. These ones are referred to frame models made of solid elements and have been taken as reference. The first frame has been represented using a geometrical model made of lines and areas. The resultant FE model contains both beam and shell elements. Structural assessment results have been compared with those ones coming from the reference model; this operation is called benchmark phase. Benchmark phase highlights that the frame representation used is too much approximate. Accordingly, the second frame has been represented with a geometrical model made of areas only, which generates a FE model containing only shell elements. With this simplification strategy, the benchmark phase better validates the model. Despite the discrepancies highlighted for the first simplification strategy adopted, the weight reduction procedure has been applied on both frames. Weight reduction obtained is about 25 % of the original weight for the first frame, and about 16 % for the second one. Thanks to the optimization restraining, weight reduction results are conservative. This implies that the frame redesign which follows the indications suggested by the tool should satisfy every structural requirement in final detailed design verification phase. As future developments, the tool can be applied on structures different from XT frames, such as manifold frames; on XT frame analysis, the introduction of spools allows the assessment of structural interactions which are not considering with these models. Moreover, implementation of a more effective and efficient optimization criteria will make the developed tool more suitable for the purpose of the weight optimization...|$|R

It is found very difficult to measure part of the cable length that has been submerged into the well since it depends on the “deflection shape” of the cable after it get exposed to the varying sea current from surface to sea bottom. The environmental load from sea current acting along the cable length will be transformed into uplift force on the other end of the cable inside the well. The combination of vertical displacement in upward direction due to uplift force and in downward direction due to cable stretch will affect the accuracy of the well depth measurement and position control of the downhole tool. Depth accuracy is very crucial in performing work inside the well. This project will study the cable behavior under prevailing dynamic sea environment for RLWI wireline operation in North Sea and will present one approach to correct inaccuracy in determining the exact location of the downhole tool inside the well from marine perspective. The study case was taken from Aasta Hansteen field with 1300 meters water depth in particular. OrcaFlex software will be utilized to perform static and dynamic analysis of the wireline cable under sea current and wave effect. OrcaFlex was developed by Orcina to support a wide range of hydrodynamic and marine structural analysis, including modeling the cable under sea current. During the analysis, the wireline behavior under currents will be observed for different operational well depth cases. The analysis results obtained from OrcaFlex simulations are vertical displacements and forces acting upon the wireline. Then recommended measures are discussed in this thesis to maximize the accuracy during “in well” work with different types of downhole tool weight. In addition, this thesis will also discuss the latest technologies of light well intervention, such as well control equipments used nowadays in RLWI operations...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is towards the <b>subsea</b> Xmas <b>Tree</b> (XT) system. The XT is {{recognized}} by the industry as an overall reliable configuration, but as in all development projects, it is a constant battle to optimize the design in a life cycle perspective taking account of several aspects such as safety, availability, maintainability and reliability. Unplanned stoppage of equipment result in high equipment downtime, high cost of repair, extensive repair time and high penalty associated with loss of production. The main objective is to study a specific XT system and to estimate the retrieval rate due to tree failures based on commercially available reliability data. Further this shall be compared to high level experience data presented. This is to initiate the process to alleviate the gap seen between generic calculations of the tree retrieval rate compared to known field experience. The XT configuration chosen to evaluate, is the Deepwater Vertical Xmas Tree (DVXT). A generalized case was constructed as the DVXT with help from Endre Willmann, the supervisor in GE Oil & Gas. The scope is limited in this context to the DVXT system and systems that influence the DVXT system in terms of tree retrieval rate and downtime due to failures in the tree system. Therefor, the subsea control systems with associated monitoring equipment are excluded from the analysis. To assess the DVXT system, a reliability analysis is performed. The reliability analysis is achieved in the following steps with proven methods from the reliability engineering discipline: 1. 	FMECA/Failure analysis 2. 	RBD/Reliability analysisA component-level FMECA is conducted to {{develop an understanding of}} main components with essential functional requirements and criticality and effect resulting from functional failure. The results from the reliability analysis conducted as a bottom-up approach indicate a retrieval rate of the production tree near 22 years. The DVXT system is shown to be a reliable configuration with high operating reliability and associated low risk through the reliability analysis. Nonetheless, several assumptions have been made. The {{focus of this}} thesis is not at the prompted absolute result, but to illustrate a reliability issue experienced by GE Oil & Gas when calculating reliability based on generic reliability data contra experience data. It is shown a significant gap between the bottom-up approach and the experience data presented. Based on the field experience collected it is indicated a MTTF for XT retrieval on the top-down approach between 100 to 200 years. This implies a factor of 5 to 10 between the bottom-up and the top-down approach. Further, it is indicated by GE Oil & Gas that a Pareto-rule seem to apply when deciding if failures require heavy workover such as XT retrieval or light intervention means such as ROV remedial actions upon repair. Applied to the sensitivity case to the bottom-up approach, assuming that in fact 80 % of XT critical failures can be restored by light intervention means, the total MTBF of 15 years predicted for XT critical failures then results in an XT retrieval rate of 75 years. This is closer to the expectations indicated by the top-down approach, but still not close to the levels indicated by recent field experience. This indicate that the bottom-up model should be calibrated with input data that is based on experience data rather than only generic to alleviate some of the distance between the two approaches. This can be performed in shape of additional model parameters, modification factors or other refinements. The results from this thesis give no clear answers to such model parameters, as no literature were found on this issue. The Pareto-rule can be utilized in order to calibrate this gap, if shown applicable based on comprehensive historic data., This has to be studied further thoroughly...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of petroleum field generates substantial values for Norway. In every development project {{there is always}} “local” and “global” contentment and Norwegian value creation depends on {{the combination of the}} two. Principally, Norwegian value creation is equal to contract value minus the value of imported goods and services for fabrication in Norway and value of Norwegian goods and services used in the fabrication for fabrication outside Norway. In this thesis, Norwegian value creation is defined as a fraction of field development cost that is delivered by Norwegian companies, measured in percentage. Cost estimation is performed using Acona Cost Estimation Software (ACES) software which breakdown field development cost into facilities-based costs and activity-based costs. This thesis estimates and analyzes Norwegian value creation in four different development projects namely Edvard Grieg, Ivar Aasen, Aasta Hansteen, and Gjøa. The four projects are chosen to represent the combination of fixed and floating production platform, dry tree and wet <b>tree</b> (<b>subsea)</b> wells, and local and foreign fabrication of platform. The analysis encompasses analysis of Norwegian value creation in facilities development and well development. Analysis of facilities development comprises 5 main facilities: (1) topside, (2) substructure, (3) subsea system, (4) export pipelines, and (5) power/fiber optic cables, and for every facility 5 main activities are examined: (i) fabrication, (ii) engineering, (iii) procurement, (iv) marine operation, and (v) project management. Analysis of well development covers 2 main activities: drilling service and well completion. The estimation result shows for facilities development Edvard Grieg generates the largest Norwegian value creation among the four projects estimated at 64 % of facilities development cost. Subsequent analysis then shows fabrication and procurement activities of topside account for the biggest development cost in a project. It indicates that location of topside fabrication and origin of goods and services used in topside development have significant effect in increasing Norwegian value creation of a project. For Edvard Grieg case, as both topside and substructure were fabricated in Norway and utilized more Norwegian suppliers in comparison to other projects it generates the highest Norwegian deliveries. This thesis also aims to analyze the competitiveness of local fabrication (i. e. fabrication in Norway) with respect to Norwegian krone exchange rates to US Dollar (NOK/USD). The analysis reveals that competitiveness of local fabrication increases when Norwegian krone depreciates against US Dollar in a long run. As for well development the four projects have comparable Norwegian value creation in a range 55 % - 61 % of respective well development cost. The comparable result is achieved because supply arrangements in drilling activities are practically the same between different projects and eventually similar suppliers are utilized...|$|R
40|$|This Master`s Thesis {{deal with}} {{integrity}} and barrier philosophy. A special {{focus has been}} on internal leakage through barrier elements. There is an increasing discussion about what a primary and secondary barrier is, how many barriers there should be, their permitted internal leakage acceptance criteria and their integrity. <b>Subsea</b> Christmas <b>tree</b> (XMT) is considered as a pressure barrier element in subsea production systems. Rules and regulations require frequent leakage testing of subsea XMT valves. Applicable standards include NORSOK D- 010, ISO 10423 and 13628 - 4 and API RP 14 B. Due to the remoteness, of the subsea well head, testing is more complicated compared to testing of platform trees (dry trees). Applicable standards specify a maximum permitted leakage rate. However, when considering testing of valves using small fluid test volume the model has limitations. A challenge is to determine if the leakage test criteria are fulfilled or not. Leak testing of subsea XMT valves is an engineering challenge. Engineers must meet leak rate standards as well as they have to understand all aspects of the leak testing procedure. Operators address a {{question of whether or not}} their correlation tool of pressure to leak rate is accurate enough. Another question regards the permitted internal leakage acceptance criteria governed by API RP 14 B; how to apply the leakage criteria to small test volumes – typical XMT volumes. By this Master`s Thesis, an issue that does not have an ideal solution today is highlighted. The issue that operating companies faces is: In questionable situations whether a valve has fulfilled the criteria or not – how to apply the leakage criteria to small test volumes, how to decide whether a XMT have to be pulled, how to increase planning security, how to save money, time and estimate the lifetime of different valves on the XMT. The problems that the Operating Company meet regarding leakage testing of XMT valves may be that the differential pressure across the valve is lost in a couple of minutes. This questions the leak test procedure; is the permitted leak rate acceptance criteria or the test interval too large? To be on the safe side when evaluating leakage tests, the Operating Company has included new permitted internal leakage acceptance criteria into their work procedures. Service personnel fear that such a strict acceptance criteria can result in an unmanageable situation with a numerous of exceptions. Another problem that may be faced is that there is no procedure of when to initiate the leakage test. This results in difficulties in comparing historical and recent leakage tests. Also, this can result in a leakage test that shows a smaller leakage than it actually do. Data from previous leakage tests of production Master – and –Wing valve on the XMT are collected. The data are used to evaluate today`s procedure of leakage testing and for correlating pressure to leak rate. Both, the new internal leakage acceptance criteria that the Operating Company uses and the permitted internal leakage acceptance criteria governed by API RP 14 B are evaluated. Today, a basic tool for correlating pressure to acceptable leak rate exists. From the technical advisors point of view it is desirable with a more accurate software tool that can correlate pressure to leak rate. To evaluate today`s practice of correlating pressure to leak rate the MultiProScale simulation tool is used. It is assumed that the simulation tool correlates the most correct leak rate due to the complexity of the simulation tool. However, this Master`s Thesis shows that such a powerful tool is not needed for correlating pressure to leak rate. Based on this Master`s Thesis, the contribution to the leakage testing procedure is an improved calculation tool of correlating pressure, temperature and compressibility changes to actual leak rate. A presentation of this Master`s Thesis is presented for the Technical advisor of Well Technology, Hilde Brandanger Haga at Statoil. She agreed with the challenges and solutions that were presented. The improved calculation tool was also introduced. A proposal was presented that not only could the calculation tool be used onshore, but it could be used to show the actual leak rate during leakage testing of the PMV and PWV offshore. The advantage with this tool is that it can ensure the competence, it helps the decision-making process, it increases planning, it decreases cost and safeguard barriers. Other contributions are recommended changes both to the leak testing procedure and the data documentation. In relation to both of the permitted internal leakage acceptance criteria, the main conclusions are: To apply the internal leakage acceptance criteria governed by API 14 B to the subsea XMT, the leakage time interval have to be reduced from 10 – to 2 minutes. This will not result in an increased number of valves that does not fulfill the acceptance criteria. Or to apply the acceptance criteria governed by API RP 14 B, the test volume has to be > 50 liters. And, the additional internal leakage acceptance criteria that are implemented by the Operating Company are stricter than the one governed by API RP 14 B. A decrease in time interval from 10 – to 2 minutes gives an increased number of valves that do not fulfill the permitted internal leakage acceptance criteria. </p...|$|R
