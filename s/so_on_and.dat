5|$|The {{idea about}} the men with the inborn ability to leave their bodies in a spirit form, has also been {{recorded}} in Slovene and Croat traditions. The spirit {{could turn into a}} bull, dog, bore, or some other animal. He intercepted bringers of bad weather, and fought with them to save the crops of his village. The men with this ability were designated by various names, such as vedomec in Tolmin, mogut in Turopolje, vremenjak in Lika and Sinj, legromant or nagromant in southern Dalmatia and the area around Dubrovnik, višćun in Dalmatia, and štrigun in Istria. A vedomec fought against another vedomec, a mogut against another mogut, and <b>so</b> <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> the winner would take bad weather to the region of his defeated foe. All these men were marked by some peculiarity connected with their birth. There were also supernatural beings, such as obilnjaks and brgants in Slovenia, and kombals in Međimurje, who clashed with each other during thunderstorms over the plenty of their territories.|$|E

25|$|Multiple {{denominations}} {{experienced a}} split from 1861 until 1865 {{due to the}} ongoing political climate but also slavery. Often to distinguish these denominations the word Southern was used. Hence, for denomination that remained in the North the word Northern was used. Examples include Southern Presbyterians and Northern Presbyterians, Southern Baptists and Northern Baptists, Southern Episcopalians and Northern Episcopalians, and <b>so</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> so forth. Such splits entailed no theological conflicts or doctrine changes, and adjectives Southern/Northern were only used to describe one's base in the Confederacy/the Union, territorial scope, political allegiance/preferences or stance on slavery.|$|E

It is said that a century of spices had infused into the brickwork, so after they were converted into flats the first residents of each building could still detect the scent after which it was named. Various new buildings have been constructed, with similarly evocative names, such as Spice Quay Heights and China Wharf.|$|E
25|$|Temporal {{resolution}} {{is the smallest}} time period of neural activity reliably separated out by fMRI. One element deciding this is the sampling time, the TR. Below a TR of 1 or 2seconds, however, scanning just generates sharper HDR curves, without adding much additional information (e.g. beyond what is alternatively achieved by mathematically interpolating the curve gaps at a lower TR). Temporal resolution can be improved by staggering stimulus presentation across trials. If one-third of data trials are sampled normally, one-third at 1s, 4s, 7s and <b>so</b> <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> the last third at 2s, 5s and 8s, the combined data provide a resolution of 1s, though with only one-third as many total events.|$|E

25|$|The Iron Age kingdoms of Israel (or Samaria) and Judah first {{appear in}} the 9th century BCE. The two kingdoms shared Yahweh as their {{national}} god, for which reason their religion is commonly called Yahwism. Neighbouring kingdoms of the time each had their own national gods: Chemosh was the god of Moab, Milcom {{the god of the}} Ammonites, Qaus the god of the Edomites, and <b>so</b> <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> in each kingdom the king was his god's viceroy on Earth. The various national gods were more or less equal, reflecting the fact that kingdoms themselves were more or less equal, and within each kingdom a divine couple, made up of the national god and his consort – Yahweh and the goddess Asherah in Israel and Judah – headed a pantheon of lesser gods.|$|E
25|$|Numerous acts of {{vandalism}} against art exhibits are known and some objects, such as Mona Lisa, Night Watch and The Little Mermaid, have been intentionally damaged several times. Many vandals {{were diagnosed with}} a mental disorder and some, such as Hans-Joachim Bohlmann, {{had a history of}} attacking artworks. A vast amount of damage consists of leaving a minor scratch, a stuck chewing gum, a pencil mark and <b>so</b> <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> usually escapes publicity. More visible acts {{of vandalism}} were premeditated, as the tool of destruction– a knife, paint, acid or hammer– was intentionally brought to the scene. In most cases, the artworks were restored. Restorations were costly and time-consuming and in many cases were followed by shielding the artwork from future attacks.|$|E
25|$|Electronic {{music is}} music that employs {{electronic}} musical instruments, digital instruments and circuitry-based music technology. An electronic musician is a musician who composes or performs such music. In general, a distinction {{can be made}} between sound produced using electromechanical means, such as violins and drums, and that produced using electronic technology. Electromechanical instruments include mechanical elements, such as strings, hammers, and <b>so</b> <b>on,</b> <b>and</b> electric elements, such as magnetic pickups, power amplifiers and loudspeakers. Examples of electromechanical sound producing devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, and the electric guitar, which are typically made loud enough for performers and audiences to hear with an instrument amplifier and speaker cabinet. Pure electronic instruments do not have vibrating strings, hammers, or other sound-producing mechanisms. Devices such as the theremin, sound synthesizer, and computer can produce electronic sounds.|$|E

25|$|An unusual {{episode in}} Marianne's life {{occurred}} {{when she gave}} birth (27 July 1785) to her first child, a son who was named Leopold after his grandfather. Marianne had traveled {{from her home in}} St. Gilgen to Salzburg for the birth. When she returned to St. Gilgen, she left her infant in the care of her father and his servants. The elder Leopold stated (by a letter that preceded Marianne back to St. Gilgen) that he would prefer to raise the child for the first few months himself. In 1786, he extended the arrangement to an indefinite term. Leopold continued to care for his grandson, taking delight in his progress (toilet training, speech, and <b>so</b> <b>on),</b> <b>and</b> commencing with the very beginnings of musical training. Marianne saw her son on occasional visits, but in general was not involved in his care. The arrangement continued until the death of her father, on 28 May 1787.|$|E
25|$|Some atomic nuclei {{possess a}} {{magnetic}} moment (nuclear spin), which {{gives rise to}} different energy levels and resonance frequencies in a magnetic field. The total magnetic field experienced by a nucleus includes local magnetic fields induced by currents of electrons in the molecular orbitals (note that electrons have a magnetic moment themselves). The electron distribution of {{the same type of}} nucleus (e.g. 1H, 13C, 15N) usually varies according to the local geometry (binding partners, bond lengths, angles between bonds, and <b>so</b> <b>on),</b> <b>and</b> with it the local magnetic field at each nucleus. This is reflected in the spin energy levels (and resonance frequencies). The variations of nuclear magnetic resonance frequencies of the same kind of nucleus, due to variations in the electron distribution, is called the chemical shift. The size of the chemical shift is given with respect to a reference frequency or reference sample (see also chemical shift referencing), usually a molecule with a barely distorted electron distribution.|$|E
25|$|On 7 August 2005, Olmert was {{appointed}} acting finance minister, replacing Benjamin Netanyahu, who had resigned in {{protest against the}} planned Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Olmert, who had originally opposed withdrawing from land captured in the Six-Day War, and who had voted against the Camp David Peace Accords in 1978, was a vocal supporter of the Gaza pullout. After his appointment, Olmert said:I voted against Menachem Begin, I {{told him it was}} a historic mistake, how dangerous it would be, and <b>so</b> <b>on</b> <b>and</b> so on. Now I am sorry he is not alive for {{me to be able to}} publicly recognize his wisdom and my mistake. He was right and I was wrong. Thank God we pulled out of the Sinai.

Thus a building's total count of actual floors may not be equal {{to the number of}} the top floor. As an example, one residential tower has a top floor labelled [...] "88", but contains only 42 actual floors. Sources that state the number of the top floor for a building's floor count may overstate the actual number of floors for the building in question. See numbers in Chinese culture, unlucky 13 and thirteenth floor for more background information.|$|E
