5|$|Dengue {{is spread}} by {{several species of}} {{mosquito}} of the Aedes type, principally A. aegypti. The virus has five different types; infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term immunity to the others. Subsequent infection with a different type {{increases the risk of}} <b>severe</b> <b>complications.</b> A number of tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting antibodies to the virus or its RNA.|$|E
5|$|The {{common cold}} is {{generally}} mild and self-limiting with most symptoms generally improving in a week. Half of cases go away in 10days and 90% in 15days. <b>Severe</b> <b>complications,</b> if they occur, are {{usually in the}} very old, the very young, or those who are immunosuppressed. Secondary bacterial infections may occur resulting in sinusitis, pharyngitis, or an ear infection. It is estimated that sinusitis occurs in 8% and ear infection in 30% of cases.|$|E
5|$|Although benzodiazepines {{are much}} safer in {{overdose}} than their predecessors, the barbiturates, {{they can still}} cause problems in overdose. Taken alone, they rarely cause <b>severe</b> <b>complications</b> in overdose; statistics in England showed that benzodiazepines were responsible for 3.8% of all deaths by poisoning from a single drug. However, combining these drugs with alcohol, opiates or tricyclic antidepressants markedly raises the toxicity. The elderly are {{more sensitive to the}} side effects of benzodiazepines, and poisoning may even occur from their long-term use. The various benzodiazepines differ in their toxicity; temazepam appears most toxic in overdose and when used with other drugs. The symptoms of a benzodiazepine overdose may include; drowsiness, slurred speech, nystagmus, hypotension, ataxia, coma, respiratory depression, and cardiorespiratory arrest.|$|E

30|$|In this study, we {{analyzed}} data {{gathered from the}} NTDB to characterize the risks for mortality and complications associated with pelvic fractures in adolescents as compared to younger children and adults. Compared to adults, adolescents were shown to have decreased mortality and <b>severe</b> <b>complication</b> rates, while children have an increased mortality rate but decreased <b>severe</b> <b>complication</b> rate. In the subanalysis of severe pelvic fractures, the same pattern emerged, although the results for complication rates were not statistically significant.|$|R
40|$|Odontogenic infections {{resulting}} in osteomyelitis of the mandible are common. However, osteomyelitis of the coronoid {{process as a}} direct consequence of third molar infection is rare. The following report describes such a case in an 18 -year-old female as a <b>severe</b> <b>complication</b> following third molar removal. Despite aggressive antimicrobial therapy and indicated treatment approach following microbiologic study, a severe osteomyelitis was present, clinically and radiographically. Finally, hemimandibulectomy, including exarticulation, was indicated to manage this <b>severe</b> <b>complication...</b>|$|R
5|$|Apart from {{attempts}} to control {{the spread of the}} Aedes mosquito there are ongoing efforts to develop antiviral drugs that would be used to treat attacks of dengue fever and prevent <b>severe</b> <b>complications.</b> Discovery {{of the structure of the}} viral proteins may aid the development of effective drugs. There are several plausible targets. The first approach is inhibition of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (coded by NS5), which copies the viral genetic material, with nucleoside analogs. Secondly, it may be possible to develop specific inhibitors of the viral protease (coded by NS3), which splices viral proteins. Finally, it may be possible to develop entry inhibitors, which stop the virus entering cells, or inhibitors of the 5′ capping process, which is required for viral replication.|$|E
5|$|Exposure may not {{be evident}} for eight hours for 50% HF, rising to 24 hours for lower concentrations, and a burn may {{initially}} be painless as hydrogen fluoride affects nerve function. If skin has been exposed to HF, damage can be reduced by rinsing it under a jet of water for 10–15 minutes and removing contaminated clothing. Calcium gluconate is often applied next, providing calcium ions to bind with fluoride; skin burns can be treated with 2.5% calcium gluconate gel or special rinsing solutions. Hydrofluoric acid absorption requires further medical treatment; calcium gluconate may be injected or administered intravenously. Using calcium chloride – a common laboratory reagent – in lieu of calcium gluconate is contraindicated, and may lead to <b>severe</b> <b>complications.</b> Excision or amputation of affected parts may be required.|$|E
5|$|Given that liver AVMs {{generally}} cause high-output cardiac failure, {{the emphasis}} is on treating this with diuretics to reduce the circulating blood volume, restriction of salt and fluid intake, and antiarrhythmic agents in case of irregular heart beat. This may be sufficient in treating the symptoms of swelling and breathlessness. If this treatment is not effective or leads to side effects or complications, the only remaining option is liver transplantation. This is reserved for those with severe symptoms, as it carries a mortality of about 10%, but leads to good results if successful. The exact point at which liver transplantion is to be offered is not yet completely established. Embolization treatment has been attempted, but leads to <b>severe</b> <b>complications</b> in a proportion of patients and is discouraged.|$|E

30|$|This final study {{population}} was subdivided into our {{three groups of}} interest: children (younger than 13  years old), adolescents (aged 13 – 17 years), and adults (aged 18 – 54 years). The children and adolescents populations together were identified as the pediatric population. Open fractures constituted 3.4  % of all fractures. Each subgroup was assessed for their odds of death and a <b>severe</b> <b>complication.</b> The main outcomes of interest were mortality and a <b>severe</b> <b>complication.</b> <b>Severe</b> <b>complication</b> was defined as having {{at least one of}} the following complications recorded: renal failure, pneumonia, bacteremia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), or a pulmonary embolism. Prehospital risk factors such as sex, race, age, arrival in shock (systolic blood pressure < 90  mmHg), Injury Severity Score (ISS), head injury, and mechanism of injury were also analyzed to determine their association with the main outcomes.|$|R

5|$|Typically, people {{infected}} with dengue virus are asymptomatic (80%) or have only mild {{symptoms such as}} an uncomplicated fever. Others have more severe illness (5%), and in a small proportion it is life-threatening. The incubation period (time between exposure and onset of symptoms) ranges from 3 to 14 days, but most often it is 4 to 7 days. Therefore, travelers returning from endemic areas are unlikely to have dengue if fever or other symptoms start more than 14days after arriving home. Children often experience symptoms {{similar to those of}} the common cold and gastroenteritis (vomiting and diarrhea) and have a greater risk of <b>severe</b> <b>complications,</b> though initial symptoms are generally mild but include high fever.|$|E

25|$|As this {{cascade of}} {{processes}} continues, fibrous tissue bands (septa) separate hepatocyte nodules, which eventually replace the entire liver architecture, leading to decreased blood flow throughout. The spleen becomes congested, {{which leads to}} hypersplenism and the spleen's retention of platelets, which are needed for normal blood clotting. Portal hypertension {{is responsible for the}} most <b>severe</b> <b>complications</b> of cirrhosis.|$|E

25|$|Alcoholics {{are often}} {{deficient}} in various nutrients, {{which can cause}} <b>severe</b> <b>complications</b> during alcohol withdrawal, such as the development of Wernicke syndrome. To help to prevent Wernicke syndrome, alcoholics should be administered a multivitamin preparation with sufficient quantities of thiamine and folic acid. During alcohol withdrawal, the prophylactic administration of thiamine, folic acid, and pyridoxine intravenously is recommended before starting any carbohydrate-containing fluids or food. These vitamins are often combined into a banana bag for intravenous administration.|$|E
25|$|For portal hypertension, nonselective beta {{blockers}} such as propranolol or nadolol {{are commonly used}} to lower blood pressure over the portal system.
