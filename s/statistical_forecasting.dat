40|$|Judgmental {{adjustments}} of <b>statistical</b> <b>forecasts</b> {{are widely}} used for improving forecast accuracy. Despite the overall effectiveness of this method, it may allow forecasters to introduce biases in <b>statistical</b> <b>forecasts</b> when they judgmentally adjust them. This paper considers three types of bias: (1) optimism bias, (2) anchoring bias, and (3) overreaction bias. We explore the effects of particular individual differences, specifically personality, motivational orientation, and work locus of control, on forecasting biases. The results indicate that a forecaster's personality and motivational orientation have significant effects on forecasting biases, whereas work locus of control {{has no effect on}} forecasting biases. Our analysis further indicates that experience, work locus of control and motivational orientation drive a forecaster's willingness to judgmentally adjust a <b>statistical</b> <b>forecast.</b> Judgmental forecasting Adjusting forecasts Sales forecasting Motivation Personality Locus of control Cognition...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{behaviour}} of poker {{players and}} sports gamblers {{has been shown}} to change after winning or losing a significant amount of money on a single hand. In this paper, we explore whether there are changes in experts’ behaviour when performing judgmental adjustments to <b>statistical</b> <b>forecasts</b> and, in particular, examine the impact of ‘big losses’. We define a big loss as a judgmental adjustment that significantly decreases the forecasting accuracy compared to the baseline <b>statistical</b> <b>forecast.</b> In essence, big losses are directly linked with wrong direction or highly overshooting judgmental overrides. Using relevant behavioural theories, we empirically examine the effect of such big losses on subsequent judgmental adjustments exploiting a large multinational data set containing <b>statistical</b> <b>forecasts</b> of demand for pharmaceutical products, expert adjustments and actual sales. We then discuss the implications of our findings for the effective design of forecasting support systems, focusing on the aspects of guidance and restrictiveness...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Existing <b>statistical</b> <b>forecast</b> {{models of}} the Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) are {{generally}} of very low order and predict {{the evolution of a}} small number (typically two) of principal components (PCs). While such models are skilful up to 25 days lead time, by design they only predict the very largest-scale features of the MJO. Here we present a higher-order MJO <b>statistical</b> <b>forecast</b> model that is able to predict MJO variability on smaller, more localised scales, that will be of more direct benefit to national weather agencies and regional government planning. The model is based on daily outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) data that are intraseasonally filtered using a recently developed technique of empirical mode decomposition {{that can be used in}} real time. A standard truncated PC analysis is then used to isolate the maximum amount of variance in a finite number of modes. The evolution of these modes is then forecast using a neural network model, which does not suffer from the parametrisation problems of other <b>statistical</b> <b>forecast</b> techniques when applied to a higher number of modes. Compared to a standard 2 -PC model, the higher-order PC model showed improved skill over the whole MJO domain, with substantial improvements over the western Pacific, Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, South China Sea an...|$|R

Baseball Prospectus employs a projection system developed by Nate Silver known as PECOTA which applies nearest neighbor analysis to calculate similarities between players from different eras. Pro Football Prospectus (written by Football Outsiders) has their own system (dubbed [...] "KUBIAK" [...] after longtime Broncos backup quarterback Gary Kubiak) for projecting future performance. John Hollinger developed a similar system for basketball players in his Pro Basketball Forecast series of books, and several APBRmetricians have expanded on his methodology.

5000|$|Similarly, {{experts in}} some studies argue that role {{thinking}} does {{not contribute to}} the accuracy of the forecast. The discipline of demand planning, also sometimes referred to as supply chain forecasting, embraces both <b>statistical</b> <b>forecasting</b> and a consensus process. An important, albeit often ignored aspect of forecasting, is the relationship it holds with planning. Forecasting can be described as predicting what the future will look like, whereas planning predicts what the future should look like. There is no single right forecasting method to use. Selection of a method should be based on your objectives and your conditions (data etc.). A good place to find a method, is by visiting a selection tree.

40|$|Since 1984, W. Gray of Colorado State University {{and a team}} of {{researchers}} have been issuing seasonal tropical cyclone forecasts for the North Atlantic Ocean. Prior to this, little work had been done in the area of long-term tropical cyclone forecasting because researchers saw minimal potential skill in any prediction models and no obvious benefits to be gained. However, seasonal forecasts have been attracting more attention as economic and insured losses from hurricane-related catastrophes rose sharply during recent decades. Initially, the forecasts issued by Gray consisted of output from simple statistical prediction models. Over time, the models became increasingly more complex and sophisticated, with new versions being introduced in 1992, 1993, 1994, 1996, and 1997. In addition, based on a combination of experience with the statistical models and other qualitative considerations such as examinations of analog years, the <b>statistical</b> <b>forecasts</b> were modified to create adjusted seasonal forecasts. This analysis assessed the skill demonstrated, if any, of both the <b>statistical</b> and adjusted <b>forecasts</b> over the benchmarks of climatology and persistence and examined whether the adjusted forecasts were more accurate than the <b>statistical</b> <b>forecasts.</b> The analysis indicates that, over the past 18 yr, both the <b>statistical</b> and adjusted <b>forecasts</b> demonstrated some skill over climatology and persistence.

40|$|A {{realistic}} two-level GCM is used {{to examine}} the relationship between predictability and persistence. Predictability is measured by the average divergence of ensembles of solutions starting from perturbed initial conditions, and persistence is defined in terms of the autocorrelation function based on a single long-term model integration. The average skill of the dynamical forecasts is compared with the skill of simple persistence-based <b>statistical</b> <b>forecasts.</b> For initial errors comparable in magnitude to present-day analysis errors, the <b>statistical</b> <b>forecast</b> loses all skill after about one week, reflecting the lifetime of the lowest frequency fluctuations in the model. Large ensemble mean dynamical forecasts would be expected to remain skillful for about 3 wk. The disparity between the skill of the <b>statistical</b> and dynamical <b>forecasts</b> is greater for the higher frequency modes, which have little memory beyond 1 d, yet remain predictable for about 2 wk. The results are analyzed in terms of two characteristic time scales...|$|R

40|$|The {{unemployment}} can {{be considered}} as one of the main economic problems. The aim {{of this article is to}} examine the differences in male and female unemployment rates in selected European countries and to predict their future trends by using different <b>statistical</b> <b>forecasting</b> models. Furthermore, the impact of adding a new data point on the selection of the most appropriate <b>statistical</b> <b>forecasting</b> model and on the overall forecasting errors values is also evaluated. Male and female unemployment rates are observed for twelve European countries in the period from 1991 to 2014. Four <b>statistical</b> <b>forecasting</b> models have been selected and applied and the most appropriate model is considered to be the one with the lowest overall forecasting errors values. The analysis has shown that in the period from 1991 to 2014 the decreasing trend of unemployment rates in the short-run is forecasted for more Eastern Balkan than the EU- 28 countries. An additional data point for male and female unemployment rates in 2014 led to somewhat smaller forecasting errors in more than half of the observed countries. However, the additional data point does not necessarily improve forecasting performances of the used <b>statistical</b> <b>forecasting</b> models...|$|E
40|$|In a very {{volatile}} {{industry of}} high technology {{it is of}} utmost importance to accurately forecast customers’ demand. However, <b>statistical</b> <b>forecasting</b> of sales, especially in heavily competitive electronics product business, {{has always been a}} challenging task due to very high variation in demand and very short product life cycles of products. The purpose of this thesis is to validate if statistical methods can be applied to forecasting sales of short life cycle electronics products and provide a feasible framework for implementing <b>statistical</b> <b>forecasting</b> in the environment of the case company. Two different approaches have been developed for forecasting on short and medium term and long term horizons. Both models are based on decomposition models, but differ in interpretation of the model residuals. For long term horizons residuals are assumed to represent white noise, whereas for short and medium term forecasting horizon residuals are modeled using <b>statistical</b> <b>forecasting</b> methods. Implementation of both approaches is performed in Matlab. Modeling results have shown that different markets exhibit different demand patterns and therefore different analytical approaches are appropriate for modeling demand in these markets. Moreover, the outcomes of modeling imply that <b>statistical</b> <b>forecasting</b> can not be handled separately from judgmental forecasting, but should be perceived only as a basis for judgmental forecasting activities. Based on modeling results recommendations for further deployment of statistical methods in sales forecasting of the case company are developed...|$|E

40|$|In {{volatile}} markets, demand forecasting {{becomes increasingly}} difficult. Usually, quantitative models {{are used to}} produce an initial <b>statistical</b> <b>forecast</b> while demand planners can manually review and adjust these forecasts if necessary. If special information is available {{that has not yet}} been incorporated into the <b>statistical</b> <b>forecasts,</b> adjustments can significantly increase forecast accuracy. However, often also unnecessary adjustments are performed. In this course, the influence of underlying behavioural concepts such as group and corporate identity or trust on the demand planners' adjustment behaviour will be discussed. Forecast data from a German Multinational Corporation are collected and analysed. Hereby, two demand management processes where forecasts are produced first by an external service provider and second from an internal department are compared to each other. In both processes, the demand planners' adjustment behaviour is analysed. Furthermore, interviews with the demand planners are conducted in order to bring light into their decision making process. Results from both the forecast data and the interviews show that above all group identity and trust {{play a key role in}} determining the adjustment behaviour. Despite lower <b>forecast</b> accuracy, <b>statistical</b> <b>forecasts</b> deriving from within the case company are significantly less often adjusted, which gives support for a strong group identity. Also, the demand planners seem to trust the internal forecasts more which results in fewer adjustments. However, these results are rather an effort to understand demand planners' adjustment behaviour better...|$|R
