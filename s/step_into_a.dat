Heisenberg leaned heavily on Bohr's correspondence principle but changed the equations so that they involved directly observable quantities, leading to the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics. Fowler sent Heisenberg's paper on to Dirac, who was on vacation in Bristol, asking him to look into this paper carefully.|$|E

Farina was ultimately sacked on 14 October 2009, with the club tasked with finding a replacement {{for the remainder of the}} 2009–10 season.|$|E
25|$|Halák was {{assigned}} to the Bulldogs {{for the majority of the}} 2007–08 season. However, after the Canadiens traded Huet on 26 February 2008, Halák took over full-time as the Canadiens back-up goaltender. He started his first playoff game on 30 April 2008 against the Philadelphia Flyers (a 4–2 loss) after sub-par performances from newly appointed starter Carey Price, who once again took over in the following game. He fulfilled back-up duties for the Canadiens into the following season. However, Halák's strong play coupled with inconsistent performances from Price led to an opportunity for Halák to <b>step</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> larger role. Ultimately, based on his strong play for the Canadiens and for Slovakia at the Vancouver Olympics, there was a strong internal push to designate Halák the team's starting goaltender. Halák went on to be named the Canadiens' Molson Cup Player of the Year for the season and was designated the starter heading into their first-round playoff match-up against the President's Trophy-winning Washington Capitals. In the sixth game of the series, Halák stopped 53 shots to set a club record for a playoff game (in regulation-time), leading the Canadiens to a 4–1 victory. Ultimately, the Canadiens overcame a 3–1 series deficit to win the series in seven games, marking one of the biggest upsets in NHL history. The win was attributed largely to Halák's play as he turned aside 131 of Washington's 134 shots in games 5 through 7, frustrating the league's top scoring team from the regular season. After defeating the Pittsburgh Penguins in seven games, the Canadiens fell to the Philadelphia Flyers in the Eastern Conference Final with a 4–1 series loss.|$|E
500|$|Pedro de la Rosa and Narain Karthikeyan {{returned}} to Formula One with HRT. De la Rosa had been without a full-time drive since the 2010 Italian Grand Prix, having spent {{the majority of}} the [...] season as a test driver for McLaren and making one appearance racing for Sauber; Karthikeyan was dropped by the team before the 2011 British Grand Prix in favour of Ricciardo. He, too, made a one-race appearance at the Indian Grand Prix, before leaving the team until the 2012 season began. Vitantonio Liuzzi, who drove for HRT in 2011, joined the Indian i1 Super Series. The series was later postponed until 2013, but Liuzzi was unable to retain his seat with the team. At the launch of the HRT F112 in March, Liuzzi was confirmed as one of the team's testing and reserve drivers alongside both former GP2 Series driver Dani Clos and Ma Qinghua, the first ever Chinese driver to <b>step</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> Formula 1 car.|$|E

Arnold later called Hrstich a [...] "freak of nature" [...] for being [...] "amazingly strong for his size".

2500|$|In the Propane Gallery, {{the most}} {{prominent}} display is an interactive hot air balloon simulation. [...] Visitors are able to <b>step</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> hot air balloon basket to not only learn about how propane fuels this device but also {{get a sense of}} an actual hot air balloon ride. Glenn Koehler, NMIH's marketing and outreach coordinator believes that the Propane Gallery is the most popular interactive exhibit. Mechanical and digital characteristics such as moving floor boards and aerial video give the viewers a very well rounded, realistic approach to a hot air balloon ride. The educational purpose of this display is to express the widespread use of propane gas.|$|E
2500|$|Commentators {{discussing}} the promotional trailers lauded the show's animation style and its musical soundtrack. The trailers prompted enthusiastic anticipation {{for the series}} premiere. When the first episode premiered at RTX, it was popular with attendees {{to the point that}} seating was full at all three screenings. Amanda Rush, writing for Crunchyroll, noted the anime and Western influences of the series, and praised it as [...] "quick-witted, exciting, lovely to look at" [...] saying fans of anime would enjoy it. The Yakima Herald-Republic called it [...] "thrilling" [...] and [...] "captivating" [...] and praised its [...] "beautiful" [...] 3D character animation. The Austin Chronicle described the premiere as making Oum the [...] "rock star" [...] of Rooster Teeth. The series has reportedly contributed to a 9% increase in views for Rooster Teeth's official YouTube channel. Kotaku's Richard Eisenbeis praised the series for its clever use of fairytale elements, fun and enjoyable dialogue, and the fighting choreography, but was critical about the short nature of the episodes, stating that, [...] "The biggest drawback in doing a micro-series... is that there is precious little time for good characterization". He was also critical of the technical issues of the animation, mentioning that the animation is good when the audience is unable to see the character's feet. He ends by saying that [...] "RWBY is a good first <b>step</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> world of possibilities." ...|$|E

2500|$|Number 10's door is {{the product}} of the renovations Townsend ordered in 1766; it was {{probably}} not completed until 1772. Executed in the Georgian style by the architect Kenton Couse, it is unassuming and narrow, consisting of a single white stone step leading to a modest brick front. The small, six-panelled door, originally made of black oak, is surrounded by cream-coloured casing and adorned with a semicircular fanlight window. Painted in white, between the top and middle sets of panels, is the number [...] "10". The zero of the number [...] "10" [...] is painted in a very eccentric style, in a 37° angle anticlockwise. One theory is that this is in fact a capital 'O' as found in the Roman's Trajan alphabet that was used by the Ministry of Works at the time. A black iron knocker {{in the shape of a}} lion's head is between the two middle panels; below the knocker is a brass letter box with the inscription [...] "First Lord of the Treasury". The doorbell is inscribed with [...] "PUSH" [...] although is rarely used in practice. A black ironwork fence with spiked newel posts runs along the front of the house and up each side of the step to the door. The fence rises above the <b>step</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> double-swirled archway, supporting an iron gas lamp surmounted by a crown. (See The Entrance Door c1930: As seen from the outside) ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the late}} 1960s shops such as Laura Ashley (whose first London outlet opened in 1968) were {{routinely}} promoting the [...] "peasant look" [...] and selling {{a range of}} [...] "uniquely eccentric clothes ... The magic was being able to <b>step</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> 'Laura Ashley' dress and imagine you had found {{something out of a}} dressing-up box". At around the same time too, and into the 1970s, the brassière (or bra), which, as noted, had been seen as a liberating innovation {{in the early part of}} the century, came to be regarded by some women, such as the Australian academic Germaine Greer (The Female Eunuch, 1969), as an unduly restrictive symbol of traditional womanhood. However, the much-publicised incidence of [...] "bra burning" [...] in the 1970s tended to be overstated and came to be satirised: for example, in the 1973 film, Carry On Girls, and a poster by Young & Rubicam, one of a mildly subversive series for Smirnoff vodka: [...] "I never thought of burning my bra until I discovered Smirnoff". It was also seen by many, including Greer herself, as a distraction from the cause of women's [...] "liberation". A Vermont lawyer later observed wryly that [...] "like every good feminist-in-training in the sixties, I burned my bra", but that [...] "now it's the nineties ... I realize Playtex [...] had supported me better than any man I know." [...] Claire Perry, who became a Conservative Member of Parliament in 2010 and later a government minister, reflected that, as a [...] "women's officer" [...] at Oxford University in the early 1980s, she was [...] "a bra-burning feminist with a hideous new-romantic haircut", but that her feminism had, in her view, matured.|$|E
