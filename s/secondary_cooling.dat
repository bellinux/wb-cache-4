2500|$|The basic {{operation}} of the CANDU design is similar to other nuclear reactors. Fission reactions in the reactor core heat pressurized water in a primary cooling loop. A heat exchanger, {{also known as a}} steam generator, transfers the heat to a <b>secondary</b> <b>cooling</b> loop, which powers a steam turbine with an electric generator attached to it (for a typical Rankine thermodynamic cycle). The exhaust steam from the turbines is then cooled, condensed and returned as feedwater to the steam generator. The final cooling often uses cooling water from a nearby source, such as a lake, river, or ocean. Newer CANDU plants, such as the Darlington Nuclear Generating Station near Toronto, Ontario, use a diffuser to spread the warm outlet water over a larger volume and limit the effects on the environment.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The first {{photoelectric}} {{observations of}} the binary WZ Cygni, are presented, analysed and discussed. They were made with the 48 -in Cassegrain reflector at the Kryonerion Station of the National Obervatory of Athens, Greece during 1993 and 1994. The light curves have been analysed using Wood’s and W-D programs; the obtained solutions support a contact configuration for the system. The latter, along with the β Lyrae type light curve shape of WZ Cyg, {{suggest that it is}} a near-contact binary. The times of the observed minimum light show that the orbital period increases. Details for the flashes, detected during our observations, are also given. These flare-like phenomena might be related to a magnetic activity on the <b>secondary</b> <b>cooler</b> component of WZ Cyg, while the observed increasing of the system’s orbital period might be due to mass transfer from the less massive star towards its mate...|$|R

40|$|We use the {{simulations}} {{presented in}} Poole et al. (2006) {{to examine the}} effects of mergers on the properties of cool cores in X-ray clusters. Motivated by recent Chandra and XMM observations, we propose a scheme for classifying the morphology of clusters based on their surface brightness and entropy profiles. Three dominant morphologies emerge: two hosting compact cores and central temperatures which are cool (CCC systems) or warm (CWC systems) and one hosting extended cores which are warm (EWC systems). In the cases we have studied, CCC states are disrupted only after direct collisions with merging cluster cores. This can happen in head-on collisions or during second pericentric passage in off-axis mergers. By the time they are relaxed, our remnant cores have generally been heated to warm core (CWC or EWC) states but subsequently recover CCC states by the end of the simulation. The only case resulting in a long-lived EWC state is a slightly off-axis 3 : 1 merger for which the majority of shock heating occurs during the accretion of a low-entropy stream formed from the disruption of the <b>secondary’s</b> <b>cool</b> core.

The mass ratio for one young binary, NTTS 160905 - 1859, is M 2 /M 1 = 0. 18 +/- 0. 01, the smallest yet measured dynamically for a pre-main-sequence spectroscopic binary.

40|$|New V {{photoelectric}} {{observations of}} the eclipsing system YY CMi, obtained at La Silla, Chile, and Merate Observatory, Italy, are presented. New times of minima and ephemeris based on our observations are also given. The V light curve was analysed by using the WD code to derive the geometrical and physical parameters of the system. Since no spectroscopic mass ratio is available, the q-search method was applied to yield the preliminary range of the mass ratio in order {{to search for the}} final solution. First the unspotted solution was carried out by using the unperturbed parts of the light curve and applying the DC program of the WD code. The solution was performed by assuming contact (mode 3) and semi-detached (mode 4) configuration, since no classification of the system is possible from the shape of the light curve. The solution in mode 4 does not lead to an acceptable model, since the secondary was found to be slightly overcontact. Therefore the contact solution was finally adopted. Moreover the light curve peculiarities (Max II fainter than Max I and excess of light around the phase 0. 32) were explained by assuming a cool and a hot spot {{on the surface of the}} <b>secondary</b> (<b>cooler)</b> component. The degree of contact is very small (f about 3 %) and the thermal contactis poor (T 1 -T 2) about 650 K. These results together with the high photometric mass ratio q about 0. 89 indicate that YY CMi is very probably a system at the beginning or the end of the contact phase.

40|$|We {{explore the}} band {{dependence}} of the inferred X-ray temperature of the intracluster medium (ICM) for 192 well-observed galaxy clusters selected from the Chandra Data Archive. If the hot ICM is nearly isothermal in the projected region of interest, the X-ray temperature inferred from a broad-band (0. 7 - 7. 0 keV) spectrum should be identical to the X-ray temperature inferred from a hard-band (2. 0 - 7. 0 keV) spectrum. However, if unresolved cool lumps of gas are contributing soft X-ray emission, the temperature of a best-fit single-component thermal model will be cooler for the broad-band spectrum than for the hard-band spectrum. Using this difference as a diagnostic, the ratio of best-fitting hard-band and broad-band temperatures may indicate the presence of cooler gas even when the X-ray spectrum itself may not have sufficient signal-to-noise to resolve multiple temperature components. To test this possible diagnostic, we extract X-ray spectra from core-excised annular regions for each cluster in our archival sample. We compare the X-ray temperatures inferred from single-temperature fits when the energy range of the fit is 0. 7 - 7. 0 keV (broad) and when the energy range is 2. 0 /(1 +z) - 7. 0 keV (hard). We find that the hard-band temperature is significantly higher, on average, than the broad-band temperature. Upon further exploration, we find this temperature ratio is enhanced preferentially for clusters which are known merging systems. In addition, cool-core clusters tend to have best-fit hard-band temperatures that are in closer agreement with their best-fit broad-band temperatures. We show, using simulated spectra, that this diagnostic is sensitive to <b>secondary</b> <b>cool</b> components (TX = 0. 5 - 3. 0 keV) with emission measures > 10 - 30 % of the primary hot component.
