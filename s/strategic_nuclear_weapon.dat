50|$|In nuclear strategy, a {{first strike}} is a {{preemptive}} surprise attack employing overwhelming force. First strike capability is a country's ability to defeat another nuclear power by destroying its arsenal {{to the point}} where the attacking country can survive the weakened retaliation while the opposing side is left unable to continue war. The preferred methodology is to attack the opponent's <b>strategic</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>weapon</b> facilities (missile silos, submarine bases, bomber airfields), command and control sites, and storage depots first.

Its primary mission is to receive, verify and retransmit Emergency Action Messages (EAMs) to US strategic forces. It does this by maintaining the ability to communicate on virtually every radio frequency band from very low frequency (VLF) up through super high frequency (SHF) using a variety of modulations, encryptions and networks. This airborne communications capability largely replaced the land-based extremely low frequency (ELF) broadcast sites that became vulnerable to nuclear strike.|$|E

[...] India’s current PM Modi has in the run up to the recent general elections reiterated commitment to no first use policy.

To assist Members of Congress in the debate, this paper discusses nine proposals for treating ICBM survivability: Recognize that ICBMs are invulnerable, rely only on bombers and submarines for deterrence, deploy a large or scaled-down shell-game multiple shelter system, defend MX with anti ballistic missiles, launch ICBMs on warning of attack, deploy MX on aircraft or small submarines, and diversify strategic forces, perhaps using small ICBMs...|$|E
