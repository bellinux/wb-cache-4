5|$|Realizing {{the need}} for new leadership, in {{what became known as the}} Polish October, the Politburo chose Gomułka, who had been {{released}} from prison and reinstated in the party, and the Central Committee's 8th Plenum elected him without a Soviet approval the new first secretary of the PZPR. Subsequently, Gomułka convinced the Soviet leaders that he would preserve the Soviet influence in Poland. Gomułka's elevation was preceded by ominous Soviet military moves and an arrival of Soviet high-level delegation led by Khrushchev, which flew into Warsaw to witness and influence the upheaval in the Polish party. After the sometimes confrontational encounters and negotiations, they soon returned to Moscow, where the Soviet leader announced on 21 October that the idea of an armed intervention in Poland should be abandoned. This position was soon reinforced by the pressure from communist China, which expressed its great power aspirations and demanded that the Soviets leave the new Polish leadership alone. On 21 October in Warsaw Gomułka's return to power was accomplished, giving rise to the era of national communism in Poland. Gomułka pledged to dismantle Stalinism and in his acceptance speech raised numerous social democratic-sounding reformist ideas, giving hope to the left-wing revisionists and others in Polish society that the communist state was, after all, reformable. The revisionists replaced and claimed to represent the worker movement, recently defeated in Poznań. The main goals in pursuit of which they engaged were political freedom and <b>self-management</b> in state enterprises. However, the end of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe was nowhere in sight. On 14 May 1955, the Warsaw Pact was signed in the Polish capital, to counteract the earlier establishment of NATO.|$|E

25|$|Not only {{useful in}} {{teaching}} explicit skills, machines could also promote {{the development of}} a repertoire of behaviors that Skinner called <b>self-management.</b> Effective <b>self-management</b> means attending to stimuli appropriate to a task, avoiding distractions, reducing the opportunity of reward for competing behaviors, and so on. For example, machines encourage students to pay attention before receiving a reward. Skinner contrasted this with the common classroom practice of initially capturing students’ attention (e.g., with a lively video) and delivering a reward (e.g., entertainment) before the students have actually performed any relevant behavior. This practice fails to reinforce correct behavior and actually counters the development of <b>self-management.</b>|$|E
25|$|Libertarian {{socialism}} {{sees it as}} a lack of workers' <b>self-management</b> in {{the context}} of substituting state and capitalist control with political and economic decentralization and confederation.|$|E
25|$|Confédération Française Démocratique du Travail (CFDT) {{union leader}} Charles Piaget led the strike. The Unified Socialist Party (PSU), which {{included}} former Radical Pierre Mendès-France, was then {{in favor of}} autogestion (workers' <b>self-management).</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite {{several decades}} when the {{organization}} was illegal in Spain, today the CNT continues {{to participate in the}} Spanish worker's movement, focusing its efforts on the principles of workers' <b>self-management,</b> federalism, and mutual aid.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the Paris co-op {{inspired}} several Canadian grassroots groups to adopt similar values in senior housing initiatives; these values include autonomy and <b>self-management,</b> solidarity and mutual aid, civic engagement, and ecological responsibility.|$|E
25|$|Some social activists {{objecting to}} the market system or price system of wage working, {{historically}} have considered syndicalism, worker cooperatives, workers' <b>self-management</b> and workers' control as possible alternatives to the current wage system.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of wage labor in 18th century Britain {{was met with}} resistance, giving rise {{to the principles of}} syndicalism. Historically, some labor organizations and individual social activists have espoused workers' <b>self-management</b> or worker cooperatives as possible alternatives to wage labor.|$|E
25|$|According to SENAES (National Office of Solidarity Economy), it is {{considered}} a solidarity economy, the ensemble of economic activities with the following characteristics: cooperation, <b>self-management,</b> economic feasibility and solidarity. In 2005, the office identified 14,954 solidary enterprises in Brazil, among which 85 are located in Porto Alegre.|$|E
25|$|Like anarchist-communists, anarcho-syndicalists seek {{to abolish}} the wage system and private {{ownership}} {{of the means of}} production, which they believe lead to class divisions. Important principles include workers' solidarity, direct action (such as general strikes and workplace recuperations), and workers' <b>self-management</b> of enterprises and the economy as a whole.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, the reformist faction {{gained control of}} the Slovenian Communist Party, {{launching}} a series of reforms, aiming at the modernization of Slovenian society and economy. A new economic policy, known as workers <b>self-management</b> started to be implemented under the advice and supervision of the main theorist of the Yugoslav Communist Party, the Slovene Edvard Kardelj.|$|E
25|$|For {{overweight}} people, {{weight loss}} {{may be an}} important factor. Patient education {{has been shown to be}} helpful in the <b>self-management</b> of arthritis. It decreases pain, improves function, reduces stiffness and fatigue, and reduces medical usage. Patient education can provide on average 20% more pain relief when compared to NSAIDs alone in patients with hip osteoarthritis.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} {{advantage of}} home testing {{is the evidence}} that patient self-testing with medical support and patient <b>self-management</b> (where patients adjust their own anticoagulant dose) improves anticoagulant control. A meta analysis which reviewed 14 trials showed that home testing led to a reduced incidence of complications (bleeding and thrombosis) and improved {{the time in the}} therapeutic range, which is an indirect measure of anticoagulant control.|$|E
25|$|After {{the failure}} of forced {{collectivisation}} that was attempted from 1949–53, a policy of gradual economic liberalisation, known as workers <b>self-management,</b> was introduced under the advice and supervision of the Slovene Marxist theoretician and Communist leader Edvard Kardelj, the main ideologue of the Titoist path to socialism. Suspected opponents of this policy both from {{within and outside the}} Communist party were persecuted and thousands were sent to the Goli otok.|$|E
25|$|Research on {{classroom}} management and pedagogy is conducted to guide teaching practice {{and form a}} foundation for teacher education programs. The goals of {{classroom management}} are {{to create an environment}} conducive to learning and to develop students' <b>self-management</b> skills. More specifically, classroom management strives to create positive teacher–student and peer relationships, manage student groups to sustain on-task behavior, and use counseling and other psychological methods to aid students who present persistent psychosocial problems.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century anarcho-syndicalism arose as a {{distinct}} school of thought within anarchism. More heavily focused on the labour movement than previous forms of anarchism, syndicalism posits radical trade unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society, democratically self-managed by the workers. Anarcho-syndicalists seek to abolish the wage system and private ownership {{of the means of}} production, which they believe lead to class divisions. Important principles of syndicalism include workers' solidarity, direct action (such as general strikes and workplace recuperations), and workers' <b>self-management.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Biennio Rosso {{took place}} in a context of {{economic}} crisis {{at the end of the}} war, with high unemployment and political instability. It was characterized by mass strikes, worker manifestations as well as <b>self-management</b> experiments through land and factories occupations. In Turin and Milan, workers councils were formed and many factory occupations took place under the leadership of anarcho-syndicalists. The agitations also extended to the agricultural areas of the Padan plain and were accompanied by peasant strikes, rural unrests and guerrilla conflicts between left-wing and right-wing militias.|$|E
25|$|Pivotal {{response}} treatment (PRT) is a naturalistic intervention {{derived from}} ABA principles. Instead of individual behaviors, it targets pivotal areas of a child's development, such as motivation, responsivity to multiple cues, <b>self-management,</b> and social initiations; it aims for widespread improvements {{in areas that}} are not specifically targeted. The child determines activities and objects that will be used in a PRT exchange. Intended attempts at the target behavior are rewarded with a natural reinforcer: for example, if a child attempts a request for a stuffed animal, the child receives the animal, not a piece of candy or other unrelated reinforcer.|$|E
25|$|Second, {{social skills}} {{treatment}} attempts to increase social and communicative skills of autistic individuals, addressing a core deficit of autism. A {{wide range of}} intervention approaches is available, including modeling and reinforcement, adult and peer mediation strategies, peer tutoring, social games and stories, <b>self-management,</b> pivotal response therapy, video modeling, direct instruction, visual cuing, Circle of Friends and social-skills groups. A 2007 meta-analysis of 55 studies of school-based social skills intervention found that they were minimally effective for children and adolescents with ASD, and a 2007 review found that social skills training has minimal empirical support for children with Asperger syndrome or high-functioning autism.|$|E
25|$|Warfarin {{and vitamin}} K antagonists are {{anticoagulants}} {{that can be}} taken orally to reduce thromboembolic occurrence. Where a more effective response is required, heparin can be given (by injection) concomitantly. As a side effect of any anticoagulant, the risk of bleeding is increased, so the international normalized ratio of blood is monitored. Self-monitoring and <b>self-management</b> are safe options for competent patients, though their practice varies. In Germany, about 20% of patients were self-managed while only 1% of U.S. patients did home self-testing (according to one 2012 study). Other medications such as direct thrombin inhibitors and direct Xa inhibitors are increasingly being used instead of warfarin.|$|E
25|$|Inclusive Democracy is a {{political}} theory and political project that aim for direct democracy, economic democracy in a stateless, moneyless and marketless economy, <b>self-management</b> (democracy in the social realm) and ecological democracy. The theoretical project of Inclusive Democracy (ID; as distinguished from the political project {{that is part of}} the democratic and autonomy traditions) emerged from the work of political philosopher, former academic and activist Takis Fotopoulos in Towards An Inclusive Democracy and was further developed by him and other writers in the journal Democracy & Nature and its successor The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy, an electronic journal freely available and published by the International Network for Inclusive Democracy.|$|E
25|$|A stroke {{can affect}} the ability to live {{independently}} and with quality. <b>Self-management</b> programs are a special training that educates stroke survivors about stroke and its consequences, helps them acquire skills to cope with their challenges, and helps them set and meet their own goals during their recovery process. These programs are tailored to the target audience, and lead by someone trained and expert in stroke and its consequences (most commonly professionals, but also stroke survivors and peers). A 2016 review reported that these programs {{improve the quality of}} life after stroke, without negative effects. People with stroke felt more empowered, happy and satisfied with life after participating in this training.|$|E
25|$|The workers now {{decided to}} open up the factory to outsiders, {{including}} journalists. This made them more popular. At first, Jacques Chérêque, the national leader of the CFDT metallurgist section, was wary of the Action Committee. At request of the striking workers, he sent a representative, Fredo Coutet, a metal worker, to discuss the strike with the local section of the CFTC. After a week, Coutet was convinced by his experience, but Chérêque remained wary. At that time, the workers were still skeptical about trying <b>self-management,</b> and requested an employer. Led by François Chérêque, the CFDT now tried to find an employer to buy the firm.|$|E
25|$|Greig had {{his first}} epileptic fit {{at the age of}} 14, during a tennis match. Successfully {{controlling}} the condition with medication and <b>self-management,</b> largely by sleeping as and when he could during Test Matches, few knew about it for much of his playing career. He was often forewarned by auras. In 1971–72, he collapsed on the field during his first match for Eastern Province and half a dozen teammates were required to hold down his large frame. The incident was explained away as heat stroke thanks to sympathetic media and team management. Returning from the tour of Australia in 1975, Greig had another epileptic fit at Heathrow Airport. His affliction became public during the Packer furore, when a number of commentators questioned his judgement in the matter and speculated that epilepsy impaired his ability to make decisions.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of personal coping strategies (including <b>self-management</b> or self-help) {{is said to}} be an important element. This can involve making use of medication or psychotherapy if the consumer is fully informed and listened to, including about adverse effects and about which methods fit with the consumer's life and their journey of recovery. Developing coping and problem solving skills to manage individual traits and problem issues (which {{may or may not be}} seen as symptoms of mental disorder) may require a person becoming their own expert, in order to identify key stress points and possible crisis points, and to understand and develop personal ways of responding and coping. Developing a sense of meaning and overall purpose {{is said to be}} important for sustaining the recovery process. This may involve recovering or developing a social or work role. It may also involve renewing, finding or developing a guiding philosophy, religion, politics or culture. From a postmodern perspective, this can be seen as developing a narrative.|$|E
25|$|From 1870 to 1876, Bakunin wrote {{some of his}} longer works, such as Statism and Anarchy and God and the State. Bakunin remained, however, {{a direct}} {{participant}} in struggles. In 1870, {{he was involved in}} an insurrection in Lyon, France, which foreshadowed the Paris Commune. The Paris Commune closely corresponded to many elements of Bakunin's anarchist programme – <b>self-management,</b> mandates delegates, a militia system with elected officers, and decentralisation. Anarchists like Élisée Reclus, and those in the tradition of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon – who had greatly influenced Bakunin – were key figures in the Commune. Despite declining health, much a result of his years of imprisonment, Bakunin also sought {{to take part in a}} communal insurrection involving anarchists in Bologna, Italy, but was forced to return to Switzerland in disguise, where he settled in Lugano. He remained active in the worker's and peasant's movements of Europe and was also a major influence on movements in Egypt and Latin America.|$|E
25|$|According to Martin (1999), {{police work}} {{involves}} {{substantial amounts of}} emotional labor by officers, who must control their own facial and bodily displays of emotion {{in the presence of}} other officers and citizens. Although policing is often viewed as stereotypically masculine work that focuses on fighting crime, policing also requires officers to maintain order and provide a variety of interpersonal services. For example, police must have a commanding presence that allows them to act decisively and maintain control in unpredictable situations while having the ability to actively listen and talk to citizens. According to Martin (1999), a police officer who displays too much anger, sympathy, or other emotion while dealing with danger on the job will be viewed by other officers as someone unable to withstand the pressures of police work. While being able to balance this <b>self-management</b> of emotions in front of other officers, police must also assertively restore order and use effective interpersonal skills to gain citizen trust and compliance. Ultimately, the ability of police officers to effectively engage in emotional labor affects how other officers and citizens view them.|$|E
25|$|After World War II {{important}} social-political {{changes were}} made in the country, which, of course, had their influence on the development of Zrenjanin, newly named in 1946. In August 1945 the Agriculture Reform Act came into force, in June 1950 the Worker <b>Self-Management</b> Act, in 1959 the first direct urban plan of the town development, which indicated the urbanism-economic development of the town, was passed. The development, in the first after war decade, was directed by the directive plans, which were based on the principles of socialist economy in which the most important industrial branches were industry and agriculture. By the 1980s many people left their villages and moved into towns which brought many changes in the social, educational and ethnic structure of the town. There was permanently shortage of housing. That is why many new parts of the town and many new apartment buildings were built. Zrenjanin became an important agricultural, industrial, cultural and sport centre, at the time Zrenjanin {{was one of the most}} powerful industrial centres of the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia led by Josip Broz Tito.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} give all {{employees}} the same access to decision-making, the basic organisations of associated labor were also applied to public services, including health and education. The basic organizations were usually made up {{of no more than}} a few dozen people and had their own workers' councils, whose assent was needed for strategic decisions and appointment of managers in enterprises or public institutions. The results of these reforms however were not satisfactory. There have been rampant wage-price inflations, substantial rundown of capital plant and consumer shortages, while the income gap between the poorer southern and the relatively affluent northern regions was unchanged. The <b>self-management</b> system stimulated the inflationary economy that was needed to support it. Large state-owned enterprises operated as monopolists with unrestricted access to capital that was shared according to political criteria. Oil crisis of 1973 magnified the economic problems, which the government tried to solve with extensive foreign borrowing. Although such actions resulted in a reasonable rate of growth for a few years (GNP grew at 5.1% yearly), such growth was unsustainable since the rate of foreign borrowing grew at an annual rate of 20%.|$|E
25|$|Workplace {{bullying}} {{is reported}} to be far more prevalent than perhaps commonly thought. For some reason, workplace bullying seems to be particularly widespread in healthcare organizations; 80% of nurses report experiencing workplace bullying. Similar to the school environment for children, the work environment typically places groups of adult peers together in a shared space on a regular basis. In such a situation, social interactions and relationships are of great importance to the function of the organizational structure and in pursuing goals. The emotional consequences of bullying put an organization at risk of losing victimized employees. Bullying also contributes to a negative work environment, is not conducive to necessary cooperation and can lessen productivity at various levels. Bullying in the workplace is associated with negative responses to stress. The ability to manage emotions, especially emotional stress, seems to be a consistently important factor in different types of bullying. The workplace in general can be a stressful environment, so a negative way of coping with stress or an inability to do so can be particularly damning. Workplace bullies may have high social intelligence and low emotional intelligence (EI). In this context, bullies tend to rank high on the social ladder and are adept at influencing others. The combination of high social intelligence and low empathy is conducive to manipulative behaviour, such that Hutchinson (2013) describes workplace bullying to be. In working groups where employees have low EI, workers can be persuaded to engage in unethical behaviour. With the bullies' persuasion, the work group is socialized in a way that rationalizes the behaviour, and makes the group tolerant or supportive of the bullying. Hutchinson & Hurley (2013) make the case that EI and leadership skills are both necessary to bullying intervention in the workplace, and illustrates the relationship between EI, leadership and reductions in bullying. EI and ethical behaviour among other members of the work team have been shown to {{have a significant impact on}} ethical behaviour of nursing teams. Higher EI is linked to improvements in the work environment and is an important moderator between conflict and reactions to conflict in the workplace. The self-awareness and <b>self-management</b> dimensions of EI have both been illustrated to have strong positive correlations with effective leadership and the specific leadership ability to build healthy work environments and work culture.|$|E
500|$|Patients {{are making}} {{increasing}} use of self-testing and home monitoring of oral anticoagulation. International guidelines on home testing were published in 2005. The guidelines stated: [...] "The consensus agrees that patient self-testing and patient <b>self-management</b> are effective methods of monitoring oral anticoagulation therapy, providing outcomes at least as good as, and possibly better than, those achieved with an anticoagulation clinic. All patients must be appropriately selected and trained. Currently available self-testing/self-management devices give INR results that are comparable with those obtained in laboratory testing." [...] A 2006 systematic review and meta-analysis of 14 randomized trials showed home testing led to a reduced incidence of complications (thrombosis and major bleeding) and improved {{the time in the}} therapeutic range.|$|E
500|$|Sergeant Yates, still undercover, seeks {{employment}} with Butters. But Keyshawn soon appears {{outside and}} begs for [...] "Yolanda" [...] back, asking {{for her hand}} in marriage. Butters insists that he cannot force [...] "Yolanda" [...] to work for him, claiming it would interfere with the [...] "true love" [...] Keyshawn and [...] "Yolanda" [...] share. [...] "Yolanda" [...] accepts the proposal, and Butters decides to quit {{his job as a}} pimp. To the delight of his employees, he encourages them to function under the <b>self-management</b> of the company so they can keep whatever they earn for themselves. While [...] "Yolanda" [...] and Keyshawn are shown celebrating their first anniversary together in a small chalet in the mountains in Switzerland, Yates suddenly decides to spring his sting operation. Revealing his true identity, he pulls out his gun and badge and informs Keyshawn that he is under arrest.|$|E
500|$|... b.As {{characterized}} by Jane Hardy, (1956 events were) [...] "...the first cycle {{of a pattern}} that would re-emerge with increasing severity over the following decades. A slowdown {{in the ability of}} the economy to deliver rising standards of living, followed by revolts triggered by price increases, led to reforms based on decentralisation and worker <b>self-management.</b> Recentralisation, repression and reform followed in its wake." [...] To [...] "...a decline in the rate of economic growth and...a fall in real average wages...the ruling class would react by introducing more control in enterprises, a higher turnover of managerial and political cadres, intensified propaganda against ideological revisionism, the suspension of certain investment projects and the reallocation of investment favouring the consumption goods sector and services." [...] But from the late 1960s, [...] "a policy of extensive growth could no longer deliver positive rates of growth and increasing standards of living." ...|$|E
500|$|Poland welcomed Gomułka's rise {{to power}} with relief. Many Poles still {{rejected}} communism, but the realities of Soviet dominance dictated that Poland could not shake-off communist rule. Gomułka promised an end to police terror, greater intellectual and religious freedom, higher wages, and the reversal of collectivization; {{and to some degree}} he fulfilled these promises. Although little changed socioeconomically, the intelligentsia experienced significant gains felt as [...] "a certain diversity and revitalization of elite public life". The dissident , a discussion group considered a precursor of the KOR, survived until 1962. Other forms of collective community expression and a legally guaranteed academic autonomy lasted until the 1968 Polish political crisis. The academic discourse was in marked contrast to the treatment afforded to workers, whose <b>self-management</b> councils that had spontaneously formed in 1956 were neutralized and brought under control of the party by 1958. In the communist era, because of their class role in the official ideology and leadership's sensibilities, workers enjoyed some clout and a degree of protection of their economic interests, on the condition that they refrained from engaging in independent politics or publicly exerting pressure.|$|E
500|$|The party {{leadership}} {{was faced with}} a choice between repressions on a massive scale and an amicable agreement that would give the workers what they wanted, and thus quieten the aroused population. They chose the latter. On 31 August Wałęsa signed the Gdańsk Agreement with Mieczysław Jagielski, a member of the party Politburo. The Agreement acknowledged the right of employees to associate in free trade unions, obliged the government to take steps to eliminate censorship, abolished weekend work, increased the minimum wage, improved and extended welfare and pensions, and increased autonomy of industrial enterprises, where a meaningful role was to be played by workers' <b>self-management</b> councils. The rule of the party was significantly weakened (to a [...] "leading role in the state", not society) but nonetheless explicitly recognized, together with Poland's international alliances. It was seen as necessary to prevent Soviet intervention by more moderate forces, including leading intelligentsia advisers and the Catholic hierarchy. The fact that all these economic concessions were completely unaffordable escaped attention in the wave of national euphoria that swept the country. In addition to the Gdańsk Agreement, similar documents were signed at other centers of strike activity, in Szczecin (Szczecin Agreement), Jastrzębie-Zdrój, and at Katowice Steelworks. The period that started afterwards is often called {{the first part of the}} [...] "Polish carnival" [...] – with the second one taking place in the late 1980s.|$|E
