5|$|The Nightmare {{simultaneously}} offers {{both the}} image of a dream—by indicating the effect of the nightmare on the woman—and a dream image—in symbolically portraying the sleeping vision. It depicts a sleeping woman draped over the end of a bed with her head hanging down, exposing her long neck. She is surmounted by an incubus that peers out at the viewer. The sleeper seems lifeless and, lying on her back, takes a position then believed to encourage nightmares. Her brilliant coloration is set against the darker reds, yellows, and ochres of the background; Fuseli used a chiaroscuro effect to create strong contrasts between light and shade. The interior is contemporary and fashionable and contains a <b>small</b> <b>table</b> on which rests a mirror, phial, and book. The room is hung with red velvet curtains which drape behind the bed. Emerging from a parting in the curtain is the head of a horse with bold, featureless eyes.|$|E
5|$|As other {{scenes of}} Carey in the latex mini {{and by the}} large red hone prop are interspersed, the club scene alters to a poker table, where Ealy reveals three of his card, '556', {{completing}} four of the seven digits of Carey phone number. The next scene finds Carey sitting on a large pink sofa in an empty room in the club, sporting only a white man's suit jacket and stilettos. As the song reaches the bridge, Carey is shown back in the club's main room dancing, as she leaves a number '4' on a nearby table for the man to find. As Carey once again {{is shown in the}} yellow latex dress, she walks down a small aisle, placing another card with the number '4' into Ealy's jacket pocket, before storming through the club by several followers. As the video ends, the number '555-6464' are shown lying on a <b>small</b> <b>table,</b> while Carey sits on the large pink sofa, and Ealy is seen on the other side gazing at her. The video concludes with Ealy slowly approaching Carey on the large sofa, as she winks and smiles to the camera.|$|E

5|$|More than 30,000 {{artifacts}} from Kronan have been salvaged and cataloged, ranging from bronze cannons {{of up to}} four tonnes to small eggshell fragments. There have been several discoveries of considerable importance, and some of unique historical and archaeological value. One of the first finds was a <b>small</b> <b>table</b> cabinet with nine drawers containing navigational instruments, pipe-cleaning tools, cutlery and writing utensils, which most likely belonged {{to one of the}} officers. As a flagship, Kronan carried a large amount of cash in the form of silver coins. Besides wages for the crew, a war chest was required for large, unforeseen expenses. In 1982, a collection of 255 gold coins was found, most of them ducats. The origin of the individual coins varied considerably, with locations such as Cairo, Reval (modern-day Tallinn), and Seville. Another 46 ducats were found in 2000. The coin collection is probably the largest gold treasure ever encountered on Swedish soil, though it was not enough to cover large expenses, which has led to the assumption that they were the personal property of Admiral Lorentz Creutz. In 1989, more than 900 silver coins were found in the remains of the orlop, at the time the largest silver coin collection ever discovered in Sweden. In 2005, a much larger cache of nearly 6,200 coins was uncovered and in 2006 yet another with more than 7,000 coins. The silver treasure of 2005 consisted almost entirely of 4 öre-coins minted in 1675, which represented over 1% of the entire production of 4 öre-coins of that year.|$|E

25|$|A grevillea {{wood veneer}} was {{used on a}} Pembroke table, a <b>small</b> <b>table</b> with two drawers and folding sides, made in the 1790s for Commissioner of the Royal Navy, Sir Andrew Snape Hamond. The timber from which the veneer was made, {{referred}} to as 'beef wood', was sent from Port Jackson by Surgeon-General John White, who arrived in the new penal colony of Australia with the First Fleet.

25|$|Some zemís are {{accompanied}} by a <b>small</b> <b>table</b> or tray, which {{is believed to be}} a receptacle for hallucinogenic snuff called cohoba, prepared from the beans of a species of Piptadenia tree. These trays have been found with ornately carved snuff tubes. Before certain ceremonies, Taínos would purify themselves, either by inducing vomiting with a swallowing stick or by fasting. After communal bread was served, first to the zemí, then to the cacique, and then to the common people, the people would sing the village epic to the accompaniment of maraca and other instruments.|$|E

25|$|Standing 22 stories high, with a {{footprint}} {{shaped like}} the letter H, new Caseros had over 1,500 cells, and {{was designed to}} hold approximately 2,000 prisoners. Cells measured 1.2m × 2.3 m, and each had a bed, a toilet, and a <b>small</b> <b>table</b> and chair, attached to the floor. The building was designed so that no direct sunlight could ever reach the prisoners. The design of the place was criticized by human rights groups before the prison was ever opened for not meeting basic standards of humane treatment.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{original}} building no longer exists, Mr Nelson of Friars' Carse built another 'Hermitage', {{of a different}} design, on the same site in 1874. The British Listed Building register {{sees it as a}} 're-surfaced' building of circa 1790. Adamson visited it in 1879 and records that it contained the rigid form of a monk, with shaven crown, chipped nose, and folded hands, lying on its back at the entrance. The building otherwise only contained a chair and a <b>small</b> <b>table.</b> The building was recently (2009) restored again and now has an interpretation board detailing its history and a trail guide indicates its location.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{computers}} use {{a variety}} of techniques. One common method, especially on higher-end processors with floating point units, is to combine a polynomial or rational approximation (such as Chebyshev approximation, best uniform approximation, and Padé approximation, and typically for higher or variable precisions, Taylor and Laurent series) with range reduction and a table lookup—they first look up the closest angle in a <b>small</b> <b>table,</b> and then use the polynomial to compute the correction. Devices that lack hardware multipliers often use an algorithm called CORDIC (as well as related techniques), which uses only addition, subtraction, bitshift, and table lookup. These methods are commonly implemented in hardware floating-point units for performance reasons.|$|E

25|$|In Eastern Orthodoxy, the anointing of a {{new king}} is {{considered}} a Sacred Mystery. The act is believed to empower him—through the grace of the Holy Spirit—with the ability to discharge his divinely appointed duties, particularly his ministry in defending the faith. The same myron used in Chrismation {{is used for the}} ceremony. In Russian Orthodox ceremonial, the anointing took place during the coronation of the tsar {{towards the end of the}} service, just before his receipt of Holy Communion. The sovereign and his consort were escorted to the Holy Doors (Iconostasis) of the cathedral and jointly anointed by the metropolitan. Afterwards, the tsar was taken alone through the Holy Doors—an action normally reserved only for priests—and received communion at a <b>small</b> <b>table</b> set next to the Holy Table.|$|E
25|$|The Painted Chamber is {{furnished}} with reproduction oak furniture {{to show what}} it looked like when new (not dark with age and polish). The painted panelling has a larger design than that the Great Parlour and is less decorative. It was discovered under layers of emulsion paint and thought to date from the 17th century. The room is displayed as the mistress's chamber; a <b>small</b> <b>table</b> by the window obtains the maximum light for sewing. The floorboards have been relaid in a 17th-century manner. In 1609, a floor was laid at a cost of five shillings and tenpence for seven days' work, as recorded in the account book. The painted panelling creates a three-dimensional effect imitating the grainy effect of wood. The wild 'squiggles' were intended to imitate walnut, a wood becoming more fashionable in the late-17th century. It was expensive so painting was used to imitate it. The paint had a linseed oil base, and feathers and combs were dragged over it to create the grained effect.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} an {{implementation of}} database signatures. Previous work demonstrates {{how to use}} signatures to reduce base table storage requirements in a data warehouse thereby improving performance of database administration tasks as well as complex queries. This work builds upon prior work by showing how signatures enable efficient indexing. This efficient indexing strategy relies partly on abstraction and also on shifting the initial query access path to <b>smaller</b> <b>tables</b> serving as parents with foreign keys into larger transactional tables. The design shrinks the size of transactional tables and their possible indices. Moving database indexing to <b>smaller</b> <b>tables</b> reduces storage requirements and processing overhead associated with the indexes. ...|$|R
