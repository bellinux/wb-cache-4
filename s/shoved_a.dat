25|$|A {{few days}} later 200 outraged African-Americans took over a meeting in City Hall and {{threatened}} to bar the doors. For three hours they pummeled City Council with angry accusations, threats, claims of a police cover-up, and physically pushed and <b>shoved</b> <b>a</b> member of Council until they moved to the District 1 police station. For an hour they threw stones and bottles at police in riot gear and smashed in the station's front door before police opened fire with bean bags, rubber bullets, and tear gas.|$|E
25|$|Miller {{received}} negative {{press in}} mid-October 2010 when his campaign's security guards made a private arrest of {{a journalist who}} was persistently questioning Miller about his record as a government employee. Tony Hopfinger, of the Alaska Dispatch, was detained and handcuffed until Anchorage police arrived and released him following a townhall event featuring Miller. No charges were filed. Though the campaign event was open {{to the general public}} and held at a public school, the security firm said it had detained the journalist because he had been trespassing and had <b>shoved</b> <b>a</b> man while attempting to question Miller.|$|E

500|$|Later {{that same}} day, on The Daily Show, Stewart poked {{fun at the}} fight by calling it [...] "the stupidest fucking thing anyone's ever seen." [...] He then apologized to Colbert, in a {{conversation}} via satellite, for inadvertently smashing him {{over the head with}} a beer bottle during the brawl, amid the confusion. [...] While Colbert accepted his apology, Stewart continued and asked why Colbert had initially responded by shoving a recycling bin over Stewart's head and hitting him with a baseball bat. [...] To which Colbert replied, [...] "No, no, Jon—I <b>shoved</b> <b>a</b> recycling bin over your head and encouraged Conan to hit you with a baseball bat," [...] and, as usual, left Stewart confused. [...] At the end of the segment, Stewart asked Colbert: [...] "Did we win that , by the way?" [...] Colbert's answer was, [...] "I think America won, Jon." ...|$|E
500|$|Acting Mayor Feinstein, Supervisor Carol Ruth Silver, and Milk's {{successor}} Harry Britt {{condemned the}} jury's decision. When {{it was announced}} over the police radio in the city, someone sang [...] "Danny Boy" [...] on the police band. A surge {{of people from the}} Castro District walked again to City Hall, chanting [...] "Avenge Harvey Milk" [...] and [...] "He got away with murder". Pandemonium rapidly escalated as rocks were hurled at the front doors of the building. Milk's friends and aides tried to stop the destruction, but the mob of more than 3,000 ignored them and lit police cars on fire. They <b>shoved</b> <b>a</b> burning newspaper dispenser through the broken doors of City Hall, then cheered as the flames grew. One of the rioters responded to a reporter's question about why they were destroying parts of the city: [...] "Just tell people that we ate too many Twinkies. That's why this is happening." [...] The chief of police ordered the police not to retaliate, but to hold their ground. The White Night riots, as they became known, lasted several hours.|$|E
500|$|When {{the first}} patrol wagon arrived, Inspector Pine {{recalled}} that the crowd—most {{of whom were}} homosexual—had grown to at least ten {{times the number of}} people who were arrested, and they all became very quiet. Confusion over radio communication delayed the arrival of a second wagon. The police began escorting Mafia members into the first wagon, to the cheers of the bystanders. Next, regular employees were loaded into the wagon. A bystander shouted, [...] "Gay power!", someone began singing [...] "We Shall Overcome", and the crowd reacted with amusement and general good humor mixed with [...] "growing and intensive hostility". An officer <b>shoved</b> <b>a</b> transvestite, who responded by hitting him on the head with her purse as the crowd began to boo. Author Edmund White, who had been passing by, recalled, [...] "Everyone's restless, angry, and high-spirited. No one has a slogan, no one even has an attitude, but something's brewing." [...] Pennies, then beer bottles, were thrown at the wagon as a rumor spread through the crowd that patrons still inside the bar were being beaten.|$|E

Also, the most memorable moment is in [...] "The Bizarro Jerry": she shoves Kevin to the ground, helping end her friendship with the bizarro group.|$|R
500|$|Critics lauded the {{development}} of the storyline between Shane and Rick. Writing for Best Week Ever, Dan Hopper stated that it presented a cold and eerie outlook {{on the future of the}} two men. Nate Rawlings of Time evaluated their physical confrontation as [...] "darn good", and Alex Crumb of The Faster Times called it [...] "wholly satisfying". Entertainment Weekly writer Darren Franich commended the fight scene; [...] "The Shane/Rick fight was great, a brilliantly extended scuffle that started out with an air of boys-will-be-boys pettiness but quickly escalated into something genuinely homicidal." [...] Goldman summated on the scene: [...] "Of course, it was also gratifying to finally see that conflict turn physical, with a fight we've been waiting to see for a long time. Rick vs. Shane was appropriately brutal and did a very good job of representing the two men's different tactics—Rick was no doubt a formidable and dangerous guy in a fight, wailing on Shane with a series of punches. But Shane was going for the kill, using anything he could grab as a weapon, as he <b>shoved</b> <b>a</b> motorcycle onto Rick at one point and then threw a massive wrench at him in an effective, 'Holy S**t!' moment." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dohrn {{was criticized}} for {{comments}} she reportedly made about the murders of actress Sharon Tate and retail store owners Leno and Rosemary LaBianca by the Charles Manson clan. In a speech during the December 1969 [...] "War Council" [...] meeting organized by the Weathermen, attended by about 400 people in Flint, Michigan, Dohrn said, [...] "First they killed those pigs, then they ate dinner {{in the same room}} with them, then they even <b>shoved</b> <b>a</b> fork into the pig Tate's stomach! Wild!"Bugliosi, Vincent, Helter Skelter, 2001 page 297Barber, David (2008). A hard rain fell: SDS and why it failed, page 211.

2500|$|From December 26 to December 31, 1969, Weatherman {{held the}} last of its National Council {{meetings}} in Flint, Michigan. Flying to the event, Dohrn and Jacobs ran {{up and down the}} aisles of the airplane, seizing food, frightening the passengers. The meeting, dubbed the [...] "War Council" [...] by the 400 people who attended, adopted Jacobs' call for violent revolution. Dohrn opened the conference by telling the delegates they needed to stop being afraid and begin the [...] "armed struggle." [...] Reminding the delegates of the murder of Sharon Tate and four others on August 9, 1969 by members of the Manson Family. [...] "Dig it," [...] Dohrn said approvingly. [...] "First they killed those pigs, then they ate dinner in the same room with them, they even <b>shoved</b> <b>a</b> fork into a victim’s stomach! Wild!" [...] She then held up three fingers in what she called the [...] "Manson fork salute." [...] Over the next five days, the participants met in informal, random groups to discuss what [...] "going underground" [...] meant, how best to organize collectives, and justifications for violence. In the evening, the groups reconvened for a mass [...] "wargasm"—practicing karate, engaging in physical exercise, singing songs, and listening to speeches. The [...] "War Council" [...] ended with a major speech by John Jacobs. J.J. condemned the [...] "pacifism" [...] of white middle-class American youth, a belief which they held because they were insulated from the violence which afflicted blacks and the poor. He predicted a successful revolution, and declared that youth were moving away from passivity and apathy and toward a new high-energy culture of [...] "repersonalization" [...] brought about by drugs, sex, and armed revolution. [...] "We're against everything that's 'good and decent' in honky America," [...] Jacobs said in his most oft-quoted statement. [...] "We will burn and loot and destroy. We are the incubation of your mother's nightmare." ...|$|E
