5|$|On Samar, where Amy first struck, reports {{indicated}} that 27people died, despite initial reports that stated {{that there were}} no fatalities. In Iloilo City on Visayas, two people were killed and seventeenothers were injured. Property damage in Bacolod, Negros was estimated at $250,000, and 52people died, with an additional 2,250persons rendered homeless. Elsewhere on Negros, 30percent of the island's vital sugar crop was destroyed. On the east coast of Leyte, the typhoon was considered the worst in living memory, and ninety percent of homes there were destroyed. In Negros Oriental, schoolhouses in Canlaon, Vallehermoso, Negros Oriental, and Guihulngan were blown down. An aerial <b>survey</b> <b>mission</b> estimated that at least of coconut plantations were devastated; other coconut plantations throughout the Philippines also suffered considerable damage. Copra crops also suffered sizeable losses, though production was expected to remain at forecast levels. Tacloban's San Jose Airfield was severely damaged by the strong storm surge from Amy. In the Tacloban and Surigao Strait area, an estimated 146people were killed. In the Leytenian town of Abuyog, the mayor had announced that 176people were killed in the town alone. Another 135fatalities were confirmed in Sogod. More than 100persons were injured by falling coconuts and other airborne debris. On Leyte alone, damage was estimated at $8million. The Red Cross estimated over a thousand homes in 41towns on Panay were destroyed by the storm. More than 20percent of crops and infrastructure were destroyed. Four people were killed on the island. Upon looping in the South China Sea, Amy brought torrential rainfall to areas of Manila, though no damage was reported.|$|E

A joint Syrian–French mission was initiated in 2006 by the Syrian Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums (DGAM) and the Paul Valéry University from Montpellier in France. The mission was led by Sylvie Blétry. After an initial <b>survey</b> <b>mission</b> in 2006, three excavation and restoration seasons took place between 2007 and 2009. Apart from a renewed investigation and mapping of the public buildings and ramparts, the Syrian–French mission also excavated areas with residential architecture.

25|$|Sheridan was {{commissioned}} as a brevet second lieutenant and {{was assigned to}} the 1st U.S. Infantry Regiment at Fort Duncan, Texas, then to the 4th U.S. Infantry at Fort Reading, California. Most of his service with the 4th U.S. was in the Pacific Northwest, starting with a topographical <b>survey</b> <b>mission</b> to the Willamette Valley in 1855, during which he became involved with the Yakima War and Rogue River Wars, gaining experience in leading small combat teams, being wounded (a bullet grazed his nose on March 28, 1857, at Middle Cascade, Oregon Territory), and some of the diplomatic skills needed for negotiating with Indian tribes. He lived with a mistress during part of his tour of duty, an Indian woman named Sidnayoh (called Frances by her white friends), daughter of the chief of the Klickitat Tribe. He was promoted to first lieutenant in March 1861, just before the Civil War, and to captain in May, immediately after Fort Sumter.|$|E
500|$|The Beagle {{was sent}} in 1831 on a <b>survey</b> <b>mission</b> which {{involved}} circumnavigating the globe, a journey {{described by the}} naturalist on board the ship, Charles Darwin, in his book The Voyage of the Beagle and which lasted until 1836. [...] It was on this journey that Darwin began to form the ideas published much later as On the Origin of Species. [...] The Beagle carried twenty-two chronometers,Frome, p.201, reports 21,Nicholas, p.5, agrees 22,Darwin (in Taylor, p.35) reports 24. an unusually large number, but necessary to ensure accuracy of the survey. [...] Three would have been commonplace on ships of the time, as this is the minimum number required to easily identify one that has gone faulty. [...] The Admiralty started a general issue of chronometers to H. M. Ships from 1825, but between about 1800 and 1840 the availability of chronometers could {{not keep up with}} the demand. [...] The Admiralty therefore only issued one chronometer to each ship unless the Captain personally owned one. [...] In those cases the Admiralty would issue a second machine to make the total up to three, reasoning that a ship with two was no better off than with one since {{in the event of a}} discrepancy it was not possible to identify the faulty instrument.|$|E

When he reached Washington in January 1855, Mullan learned that Congress had appropriated $30,000 ($ in [...] dollars) to build a military wagon road from the confluence of the Platte and Missouri rivers in the Nebraska Territory to the military road leading from Fort Walla Wall to Olympia.

2500|$|Departing Sydney on 16 July {{using only}} one engine to {{conserve}} fuel, Marion headed through the Strait of Belle Isle and began her oceanographic <b>survey</b> <b>mission.</b> Initially, only Smith and his executive officer, Lieutenant Noble Ricketts, had {{the knowledge of}} how to sample the Arctic waters for temperature and salinity but they trained additional men to handle the instruments used for the survey. At each stop the ship's position was noted and a sounding was made while the temperature and salinity samples were collected. With [...] of sample wire in the water, both winches that handled the sampling equipment failed on 27 July. The crew managed to retrieve the wire in the dark in three hours by using the anchor windlass to heave the line in. In the meantime, one failed winch was repaired using parts scavenged from a spare and the line was spooled back onto the winch. The repair evolution was completed by morning with one winch operational. By July 31, Danish officials in Greenland had radioed permission for Marion to put into Godthaab for repairs to the other winch and the crew worked through the day to remove the two ton winch to shore for repair and replace it on the deckhouse. Marion departed Godthaab that evening with repairs completed.|$|E
