5|$|Electricity was {{introduced}} in Upminster in 1926. Gas main supply came from Romford in 1872 and from 1905 there was gas <b>street</b> <b>lighting.</b> The area was served by good spring water, with mains supply provided by the South Essex Waterworks Company from 1836. Works on the sewerage system began in 1899 in Upminster village and Corbets Tey. In 1922 sewage works for Upminster and Cranham were opened in Great Warley. Land for Upminster Park was purchased by the parish council in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Off-grid system {{users can}} either adapt to {{intermittent}} power or use batteries, photovoltaic or diesel systems {{to supplement the}} wind turbine. Equipment such as parking meters, traffic warning signs, <b>street</b> <b>lighting,</b> or wireless Internet gateways may be powered by a small wind turbine, possibly combined with a photovoltaic system, that charges a small battery replacing {{the need for a}} connection to the power grid.|$|E
5|$|A {{scheme was}} devised during the Second World War to protect major cities from enemy bombing by {{lighting}} decoy fires on nearby open land. Manchester {{was protected by}} four of these Starfish sites as they were known, two of them on Chat Moss. RAF Balloon Command {{was responsible for the}} administration and manning of the sites, which were fully operational by 23January 1941. Each consisted of an air raid shelter for the crew along with various devices to simulate <b>street</b> <b>lighting</b> and the explosions of incendiary bombs. The effectiveness of the decoy sites is uncertain, and they were closed in 1943.|$|E

50|$|Wireless ad hoc smart <b>street</b> <b>light</b> {{networks}} {{are beginning to}} evolve. The concept is to use wireless control of city <b>street</b> <b>lights</b> for better energy efficiency, {{as part of a}} smart city architectural feature. Multiple <b>street</b> <b>lights</b> form a wireless ad hoc network. A single gateway device can control up to 500 <b>street</b> <b>lights.</b> Using the gateway device, one can turn individual lights ON, OFF or dim them, as well as find out which individual light is faulty and in need of maintenance.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — <b>Street</b> <b>lights</b> are {{the large}} {{consumer}} {{of energy in}} the cities, using upto fifty percent of the city’s energy. An intelligent <b>street</b> <b>light</b> management system based on LED lamps and wireless communication technologies can be designed and installed in the cities. Though, it will have initial cost of investment for replacing the traditional wired systems but lots of power can be saved by using this system. An intelligent <b>street</b> <b>light</b> system can detect vehicles and vary the intensity of the <b>street</b> <b>light</b> by using LED lamps as per the traffic flow. It can also help in monitoring and controlling of <b>street</b> <b>light</b> system and fault detection of the lamps through wireless technology...|$|R

5|$|In April 1811 the Portsea Island Company {{constructed}} the first {{piped water supply}} to upper and middle class houses. It supplied water to approximately 4500 of the 14,000 houses, generating an income £5000 a year. HMS Victorys active career ended in 1812, when she was moored in Portsmouth Harbour and used as a depot ship. The town of Gosport contributed £75 a year towards the ship's maintenance. In 1818, John Pounds began teaching working class children in the country's first ragged school. In 1820, the Portsea Improvement Commissioners installed gas <b>street</b> <b>lighting</b> throughout the town, followed by Old Portsmouth three years later.|$|E
5|$|Kolkata is {{administered}} by several government agencies. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation, or KMC, oversees and manages the civic infrastructure of the city's 15boroughs, which together encompass 141wards. Each ward elects a councillor to the KMC. Each borough has a committee of councillors, each of whom is elected to represent a ward. By means of the borough committees, the corporation undertakes urban planning and maintains roads, government-aided schools, hospitals, and municipal markets. As Kolkata's apex body, the corporation discharges its functions through the mayor-in-council, which comprises a mayor, a deputy mayor, and ten other elected members of the KMC. The functions of the KMC include water supply, drainage and sewerage, sanitation, solid waste management, <b>street</b> <b>lighting,</b> and building regulation.|$|E

Hence, development activities such as infrastructure and amenities to the pilgrims, apart from security, gets priority attention.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} Giffnock railway station in 1866 allowed {{business}} people to build sandstone villas and commute daily to the city. At the time, {{it was much}} more desirable to live in Giffnock than to live in the smog-polluted city. By the early 1890s, residential Giffnock began to grow around the railway station and Eastwood Toll, and by 1892 gas was introduced to the area. Gas street lamps were erected by Busby and District Gas Company in 1893; however, these were supported by a voluntary subscription that many households refused to pay, leaving many areas unlit. It was not until October 1896, when Eastwood Parish Council took over <b>street</b> <b>lighting,</b> that the area was consistently lit at night.|$|E
5|$|In Vienna {{during the}} first week in August, Kalākaua had made the {{acquaintance}} of The New York Times co-founder George Jones, who noticed the King had an interest in Thomas Edison's work with electric lighting. Returning to New York, Jones arranged for Kalākaua and Armstrong to visit Edison on September 25. The King expressed an urgent need for Honolulu to upgrade its <b>street</b> <b>lighting,</b> which at that time was provided by kerosene lamps. Edison demonstrated some electric light bulbs, and Kalākaua showed interest in the technical details. The Sun newspaper reported that Armstrong joked with Edison about generating electric power from Hawaiian volcanoes. They left the city by train on the following day for Philadelphia, staying there for a brief rest, and then heading south to Washington, D. C.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} project investigates LED <b>street</b> <b>lights</b> {{as a tool}} for sustainable development in SÃ£o José dos Campos, Brazil. The project explores the energy and maintenance impacts of using LED in the place of conventional <b>street</b> <b>lights</b> by assessing the LED <b>street</b> <b>light</b> retrofit projects of eighteen case study cities. These case studies are also analyzed for the secondary impacts of LED <b>street</b> <b>lights</b> resulting from a new light source. Using an example LED <b>street</b> <b>light</b> (Lumi R-Series), projections are made for SÃ£o José dos Campos on the potential energy and maintenance effects of LED <b>street</b> <b>lights</b> compared to the existing <b>street</b> <b>light</b> network. The final part of the research addresses the local municipal government' s interest of how to implement a <b>street</b> <b>light</b> retrofit project in SÃ£o José dos Campos while stimulating economic development through the creation of a local LED lighting company. The results show that energy and maintenance expenditures were significantly reduced in each of the eighteen case studies as a result of implementing LEDs. Data also indicated that some secondary benefits were caused by the use of these <b>street</b> <b>lights</b> including reduced criminality, increased road safety, positive public perception and reduced light pollution. The projections for SÃ£o José dos Campos suggest an energy savings of at least seventy percent and a payback period of just over ten years. Finally, a project implementation strategy, via a build-operate-transfer public-private partnership, is suggested to the city of SÃ£o José dos Campos as the most feasible method to achieve the city' s development goals and overcome the challenges of such a significant infrastructure improvement project...|$|R

30|$|In {{the case}} of <b>street</b> <b>light,</b> the optical design is used to project {{the lights on the}} roadway. A special design to reach an OUF as high as 81 % is {{proposed}} with beam shaping technology [46],[47]. In general, the light pattern is projected on the roadway but with more diffusive light pattern. Typically, the OUF is between 35 % and 45 % in the roadway area around the location of the <b>street</b> <b>light</b> [43]. Therefore, the OUF in <b>street</b> <b>light</b> could be set 45 %. To achieve higher luminous efficacy, CRI could be sacrificed. Green-white or yellow-white is potential to be adopted in <b>street</b> <b>light</b> for energy saving purpose.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{many of the}} large country estates in the area, with their mansions and {{associated}} grounds and outbuildings, were split up into smaller plots of land, attracting haphazard housing development and small farms. By {{the outbreak of the}} First World War in 1914 Crawley had grown into a small but prosperous town, serving a wide rural area and those passing through on the A23 London–Brighton road. Three-quarters of the population had piped water supplies, all businesses and homes had electricity, and piped gas and <b>street</b> <b>lighting</b> had been in place for 50years. An airfield was opened in 1930 on land near the racecourse. This was a private concern until the Second World War when it was claimed by the Royal Air Force.|$|E
5|$|Rapid {{economic}} development {{during the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists. Tycoons like Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D. Rockefeller, and Andrew Carnegie led the nation's progress in railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became {{a major part of}} the economy, with J. P. Morgan playing a notable role. Edison and Tesla undertook the widespread distribution of electricity to industry, homes, and for <b>street</b> <b>lighting.</b> Henry Ford revolutionized the automotive industry. The American economy boomed, becoming the world's largest, and the United States achieved great power status. These dramatic changes were accompanied by social unrest and the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements. This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which saw significant reforms in many societal areas, including women's suffrage, alcohol prohibition, regulation of consumer goods, greater antitrust measures to ensure competition and attention to worker conditions.|$|E
5|$|Since 1974 Whitby {{has been}} {{administered}} by Scarborough Borough Council, {{one of the}} seven district councils in North Yorkshire.

North Yorkshire County Council is a non-metropolitan county providing education, transport, highways, fire, waste disposal, social and library services. At the lowest level of governance Whitby has a town council which, for election and administrative purposes, is divided into six electoral wards represented by 19 councillors responsible for burial grounds, allotments, play areas and <b>street</b> <b>lighting.</b> Elections to the town council are held every four years.|$|E
50|$|For the <b>street</b> <b>light</b> programme, {{the total}} {{connected}} load of <b>street</b> <b>lights</b> {{across the country}} of around 3400 MW, {{can be reduced to}} 1400 MW by replacing conventional lights with LED based <b>street</b> <b>lights.</b> These replacements can lead to savings of approximately 9 billion KWh of energy and cost saving of Rs. 5,500 crore to municipalities annually. Use of LEDs in public lighting could result in more than 50% reduction in energy consumption.A total of 19.6 lakh LED <b>street</b> <b>lights</b> has already been replaced in the country which is resulting in daily energy savings of 7.5 lakh kWh, avoid capacity of 68.5 MW and reducing 627 t of CO2.|$|R
40|$|<b>Street</b> <b>lights</b> are {{fixtures}} {{found in}} every city and serve the important purpose of illuminating the streets and keeping the roads safe for pedestrians and drivers.

5|$|The Priory's {{principal}} church, St Bartholomew-the-Great, was reconfigured {{after the}} dissolution of the monasteries losing the western third of its nave. Reformed as an Anglican parish church, its parish boundaries were limited {{to the site of the}} ancient priory and a small tract of land between the church and Long Lane. The parish of St Bartholomew the Great was designated as a Liberty, responsible for the upkeep and security of its fabric and the land within its boundaries. With the advent of <b>street</b> <b>lighting,</b> mains water and sewerage during the Victorian era, maintenance of such an ancient parish with so few parishioners became increasingly uneconomical after the Industrial Revolution. Thus, in 1910, it agreed to be incorporated by the Corporation of London which guaranteed financial support and security. Great St Barts' present parish boundary includes just 10 feet (3.048 m) of Smithfield — possibly delineating a former right of way.|$|E
5|$|The State of Washington {{operates}} a public government administration office in Omak {{for access to}} social and health assistance. Omak {{is considered to be}} a code city, based on proposals to provide the local government with more authority from its previous second-class city status. With a functional court for traffic, parking and civil infractions, the city maintains the sewer, water, local road, sidewalk, <b>street</b> <b>lighting,</b> animal control, building inspection, park, and recreation services. It also funds a volunteer fire department which services Omak and nearby rural communities. The Omak Fire Department estimated that there were 312 service calls around 2012, of which 80 included fire emergencies, 105 emergency medical incidents, six hazardous conditions, 26 service calls and three calls related to excessive heat concerns.|$|E
5|$|The city {{expanded}} police protection, even temporarily having volunteer {{police officers}} to assist the three paid officers. Fire protection was expanded in 1882, with the city's first 13 paid firefighters. Former mayor Henry Vollmer accomplished several public works achievements, including large street paving and new sub-divisions being plotted. A large city budget surplus brought {{the creation of the}} Davenport City Hall. After 1900, each mayor brought new agendas for city improvement. Waldo Becker encouraged new railroads for the city. He also promised a more business-like government, in terms of financial responsibility and to depoliticize the police department. In the mid-1920s the city established the first zoning ordinances, electrical traffic signals and <b>street</b> <b>lighting.</b> The city also expanded with the incorporation of the city of Rockingham and the establishment of the Davenport Municipal Airport.|$|E
50|$|The {{lifespan}} of an LED <b>street</b> <b>light</b> {{is determined}} by its light output compared to its original design specification. Once its brightness decreases by 30 percent, an LED <b>street</b> <b>light</b> {{is considered to be}} {{at the end of its}} life.|$|R
50|$|Most LED <b>street</b> <b>lights</b> have a {{lens on the}} LED panel, {{which is}} {{designed}} to cast its light in a rectangular pattern, an advantage compared to traditional <b>street</b> <b>lights,</b> which typically have a reflector on the back side of a high-pressure sodium lamp. In this case, much of the luminance of the light is lost and produces light pollution in the air and surrounding environment. Such <b>street</b> <b>lights</b> can also cause glare for drivers and pedestrians.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Street</b> <b>lights</b> {{can be made}} {{intelligent}} {{by placing}} cameras or sensors on them, which enables them to detect movement (e.g. Sensity's Light Sensory Network, GE's [...] "Currents"). Additional technology enables the <b>street</b> <b>lights</b> to communicate with one another. Different companies have different variations to this technology. When a passer-by is detected by a camera or sensor, it will communicate this to neighboring <b>street</b> <b>lights,</b> which will brighten so that people are always surrounded by a safe circle of light.|$|R
