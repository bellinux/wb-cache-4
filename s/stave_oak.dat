While the early lumber companies cut the vast Ozark pine forests, timber has remained a major asset, with white <b>oak</b> <b>staves</b> for barrels, <b>oak</b> flooring, pallets, charcoal briquettes and lumber. The Bunker-Cul1er Lumber Co. in Bunker was one of the area's biggest industries, and like the mines which hauled wood for the kilns from a large area, Bunker-Cul1er used rails to bring in logs.|$|R

40|$|Producción CientíficaAbstract In this work, {{we present}} a {{high-resolution}} oxygen imaging approach to study the two-dimensional oxygen dis- tribution inside an <b>oak</b> <b>stave</b> in contact with wine and that applies the series resistance model to explain the dynamic evolution of oak wood oxygen transfer rate (OTR). Oxygen flux throughout the <b>oak</b> <b>stave</b> has been studied by considering the wood as a permeable membrane with moisture content (MC) in a decreasing gradient from the wine-contacting side of the <b>oak</b> <b>stave</b> to the side in contact with atmospheric air in cellar conditions. The presence of different levels of liquid across {{the thickness of the}} wet stave modifies the oxygen diffusion flux, as the diffusion coefficient of oxygen in water is four orders of magnitude lower than in air. The stave resem- bles a multilayered membrane, where wood with an MC over the fiber saturation point represents a distinct layer. To that end, three simultaneous measurements were made, namely the MC profile of the wood within the thickness of the stave at different liquid-wood contact times, the OTR of the stave at those times, and finally the oxygen concentration profile with- in the thickness of the stave using planar optical sensors, a color camera, and ratiometric image analysis. The results show heat flux and oxygen flux that is analogous to that in a multilayer. Junta de Castilla y León (programa de apoyo a proyectos de investigación – Ref. VA 124 U 14...|$|R

50|$|Britain’s Navigation Acts {{prevented}} New England from trading its valuable commodities {{with other}} European nations. However, timber was {{excluded from the}} Navigation Acts allowing the colonies to export vast quantities of wood commodities to nations otherwise beholden to British duties. <b>Oak</b> <b>staves</b> for wine barrels, along with building timber, white pine boards, and cedars shingles were traded to Spain, Portugal, the Canary Islands, the Azores, and Madeira. In addition, inter-colonial trade was unrestricted, allowing {{for the development of}} a major trade relationship with British Barbados.|$|R

5000|$|Rémy Martin uses {{traditional}} distillation on the lees (retaining the sediments {{that occur}} during vinification of the grapes) in small copper stills. Ageing {{takes place in}} oak barrels of the Limousin type, during which the alcohol evaporates (the angels' share) and blackens {{the walls of the}} cellars. The eau-de-vie slowly evolves over time, punctuated by periods of rest and changes of barrel. The exchanges between the wood, oxygen and the eaux-de-vie are constant. Depending on which style is sought, cognac can age in young or old barrels, with a stronger or finer grain on the <b>oak</b> <b>staves.</b> Finally comes the blending of the different barrels to create a cognac.|$|R

Oak went by the Welland Canal to Scotland to be used for ship building. Thousands of cords of wood were sent to Cleveland, Sandusky and the Lake Erie Islands to be used for fuel for the Buffalo/Detroit steamships. A great number of the products from Oak Harbor manufacturing went down the Portage River and on to world ports.|$|R

Among the finds were 50 water wells. For this study two of these wells were investigated at the Cultural Heritage Agency (lab Stichting RING/RCE). One water well was made of a discarded cask made of 23 <b>oak</b> <b>staves</b> and a piece of beech. Samples were taken from the staves and the tree rings measured. The staves were found to originate from one single tree. Synchronising the data from all staves created a series of 111 tree rings, including 11 sapwood rings. This series did not match reliably with the reference chronologies. Cross-dating individual staves with the chronologies was not successful either. The piece of beech could not be dated dendrochronologically. The second water-well, a hollowed-out oak, was sampled, the synchronised measurements totalled 92 rings, no sapwood was present. The wood did not match with the reference chronologies...|$|R
40|$|The present time, {{which is}} {{characterized}} by very strong downward pressure on price, forces wine producers to look for new technological processes that {{would enable them to}} offer cheaper wines without reduction of quality. Mechanization innovations enabling more economical works in vineyards and wineries are already absolutely commonplace. The winemakers try to look for savings in further technological steps. One branch of technological developing, which is opening, is the branch of alternative wine aging methods using the aging-substitutes such <b>oak</b> chips, <b>staves</b> or using <b>oak</b> dust. All these alternative wine aging methods open a wide variety of possibilities, when winemakers can choose from variety of shapes of different oak substitutes, geographically diverse wood types, different types of toasting or different time of contact substitutes with wine. Many studies and experiments have been created for this topic, and we can expect very rapid development of the knowledge about of this branch winemaking technology...|$|R
50|$|Corry was {{involved}} in the timber trade, and Pomerania was a major source of oak planks used in ship building and <b>oak</b> <b>staves</b> used in the manufacture of barrels. Oak was a highly prized commodity and in short supply. Most of the British oak had been used up through the building of war ships. It has been estimated that Nelson's flagship, HMS Victory, built earlier in the eighteenth century, consumed over five thousand oak trees. In Corry's time, oak was felled and floated down the Vistula River to Danzig on a mass scale. As a ship owner he may have shipped the timber to England or Ireland in his own vessels. By hindering the efforts of the French and Spanish to import timber from Danzig his motives were as much about protecting his own interests as they were about protecting the interests of England. The potash trade made fortunes for some traders at this time and played an important part in the commercial life of Poland. It is possible that Corry was also involved in the potash trade for he refers to it several times in his letters to Secretaries of State.|$|R

40|$|Wood of Quercus pyrenaica has {{suitable}} {{properties for}} the wine ageing process. However, the forest {{available for the}} barrel making from this particular type of tree is very limited. Nevertheless, it is highly advisable to use this kind of wood in order to manufacture alternative oak products. This study {{presents the results of}} ageing the same red wine using different pieces of wood (chips and <b>staves)</b> of Spanish <b>oak</b> (Q. pyrenaica), American oak (Quercus alba) and French oak (Quercus petraea) in conjunction with small, controlled amounts of oxygen. In addition, the phenolic parameters, colour and sensory analysis point out that wines aged with Q. pyrenaica pieces have similar enological characteristics to those aged with American or French oak pieces of wood (chips and staves). Furthermore, the total oxygen consumed and its relation with sensory properties also has been studied in this article in order to know how the oxygen behaves in these processes. Besides, it is going to put forward the fact that chips and staves from Q. pyrenaica oak are suitable for the ageing of red wines and better considered than American or French ones, showing higher aromatic intensity, complexity, woody, balsamic and cocoa. Finally, the tasters valued highly the wines with staves, pointing out its flavour and roundness in mouth...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a novel microwave technology application which investigates {{the ability of}} a new equipment prototype, based on high frequency microwaves, to reduce microbial populations in oak wine barrels. American and French <b>oak</b> <b>staves</b> from highly contaminated barrels were treated. It was demonstrated that microwave treatment was able to significantly decrease the main wine associated microorganism populations from the first 8 mm of oak surfaces. However, the reduction in viable counts depended on the studied microorganism. Thus, counts were reduced by 36 %– 38 % for total yeast, from 35 % to 67 % for Brettanomyces and around 91 %– 100 % for lactic acid bacteria and acetic acid bacteria, using a very short treatment time (3 min). Nowadays, there is not a convenient method for decontaminating barrels and microwave technology may be a more efficient treatment than currently available methods. Findings from this research suggested that microwave would be beneficial for wine industry and environment by increasing barrel functionality, reducing frequency of replacement, improving microbiological control of oak wood, as well as minimizing of preservative use.

5000|$|Location on the Saint John River {{afforded the}} early {{settlers}} in Maugerville access to trade goods from New England. The economy of early Maugerville was centered on agriculture, lumbering, fishing and the fur trade. Settlers {{were able to}} produce quantities of agricultural produce beyond {{the needs of their}} community. The River contained an abundance of fish and the countryside copious numbers of furbearing animals and wildlife for pelts and skins. [...] Lumbering supplied white and red <b>oak</b> <b>staves</b> for both the lime burning business in Saint John and the rum and molasses trade in the West Indies. In the late 1770s and early 1780s the Maugerville settlers produced wooden structural components, including white ash oar rafters, for the British navy. The products of the local Maugerville economy were bartered for goods supplied by the trading company set up in Saint John, at Portland Point, in the spring of 1764 by James Simonds and James White and others. These merchants carried on business with Newburyport and Boston with boats running between the three ports. During the spring and fall Company sloops went up and down the Saint John River providing Maugerville residents with goods that included everything from a needle to an anchor.|$|R
50|$|Before the retail, {{leisure and}} {{business}} parks were built Middlebrook {{was the site}} of Sefton Fold Farm in Horwich. The old timber-framed farmhouse with sandstone flag roof as could have been seen latterly would seem to have dated from the 16th century with many intervening changes. The floor plan would indicate a 3-bay farmhouse or hall: the latter access being a 'baffle' entry facing the central chimney stack; this may have also been the original position but could have been a more traditional 'screens' entrance adjacent to the service bay. A cellar appears to have been located under the northern service bay and later GMAU investigations would infer that this used to be occupied by a small water wheel (for grinding domestic crops?) That would also infer that a stream ran under the house at this point. A well existed very nearby in the yard but any evidence of a stream latterly had become obscured. Something of a rebuild appears to have happened around 1666 and was possibly refaced or altered in 1811, as evidenced by the semi-circular datestone over the adjacent cottage which dates from 1811. However, an earlier late-Georgian brick wing was seemingly added before that date, the bricks having been locally 'clamped'. The old bay (parlour) closest to the 'new wing' as described had already had its wattle and daub removed and replaced with brick. The middle bay (housebody) and end bay (service) together with the north gable had been rebuilt in 'watershot' squared & coursed gritstone rubble, although when that happened is not clear, because the stone of the adjacent 1811 cottage was constructed from thinner, flaggy sandstone and not watershot. The rear of the range was extended, evidently in the 19th Century, from random sandstone rubble walling under a full 'catslide' stone flag roof, and this extension had a floor over creating a loft: this loft was accessed from the first floor and was lain with compressed straw and other material. Floorboards upstairs in the main range were butt-jointed and wide, of random size; some doorleaf stiles and rails were reed-moulded and mortise-framed and simply panelled, indicating 17th Century origin. The floor over the 'housebody' was a much later addition to the original, being supported off separate beams running parallel to the long walls and resting on inserted brackets or 'corbels'. The mortises and pegholes to the former arch-bracing to the central house frame could still be seen, identifying that this part of the house was possibly originally double-height, or at least, the floor was set much higher than latterly, rendering the upper floor of poor usage. There is also the presence of a vestige of a wattle and daub 'fire hood', a forerunner of a later brick chimney stack. The opening {{to one side of the}} chimney stack upstairs was blocked up economically in brick-on-edge - the bricks were machine-pressed with 'frogs' and bore the text 'Yates Plastic Horwich'. Much of the original timber framing remained within the rear 'outshut' including a former unglazed window complete with <b>Oak</b> <b>stave</b> mullions. the timber framing was set upon a high sandstone plinth - the same remained on the main frontage under the brick infill to the 'parlour' bay. The complete wallplate remained over the rebuilt main east facade and exhibited all the original mortises and peg holes from the original framing, so a reasonable guess could be made at the appearance of the building. the timbers in the 'outshut' were all re-used and exhibited peg holes, mortises and carpenters' marks. There is a case for supposing that these were taken from the timbers replaced by the later stonework, and one beam in particular hinted at coming from the old north gable truss chord, due to its size and moulding. Other evidence in the timbers points at herringbone patterning within the framing, which would reflect the regional trend for such decoration. (these detailed notes modified and expanded by Mark Head, who surveyed the house in about 1985). Before demolition in 1996 the University of Manchester's Archaeological Unit spent three weeks on the Sefton Fold Farm site. The team excavated a moated site of late medieval origins and pottery believed to date from the late 16th or early 17th centuries was found. When development started, the site was partly covered by a roundabout. The farmhouse's 1666/1811 date stone, 1860s cooking range and other items were saved and can be seen at the Heritage Centre in Horwich.|$|R
