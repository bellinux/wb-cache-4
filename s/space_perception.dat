40|$|Space is characterised by {{both its}} {{material}} and its social aspects. To examine <b>space</b> <b>perceptions</b> in this holistic understanding {{it is crucial}} to combine verbal with visual data and reactive with non-reactive methods, because not every perception is verbally expressible. The article starts illustrating a socio-spatial-material concept of space. Based on this it will be displayed how a triangulative research design with visual interview stimuli, participant observation, mental maps, photo do-cumentation, and architectural analysis can enable to get new insights into spatial perceptions. This will be shown by outlining two specific research projects, the first focuses on the space experience and imaginations of elderly people, the second on <b>space</b> <b>perceptions</b> of library users. The projects with their approaches and results clarify the impact of the triangulation of visual data and non-reactive methods in the exploration of spatial perception. Further-more, the contribution of every kind of method will be shown in the discussion of the results and unexpected findings. Finally, the article reveals in a broader context {{that it is important to}} combine text-based and visual methods, not only for the collection of data but for the presentation of research results as well...|$|R

50|$|A {{change in}} brain {{structure}} (typically lesions) disturbs the psychological process of understanding sensory information, {{in this case}} visual information. Disturbance of only visual motion is possible due to the anatomical separation of visual motion processing from other functions. Like akinetopsia, perception of color can also be selectively disturbed as in achromatopsia. There is an inability to see motion despite normal spatial acuity, flicker detection, stereo and color vision. Other intact functions include visual <b>space</b> <b>perception</b> and visual identification of shapes, objects, and faces. Besides simple perception, akinetopsia also disturbs visuomotor tasks, such as reaching for objects and catching objects. When doing tasks, feedback of one's own motion appears to be important.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1800s, Hermann Helmholtz, a German {{physician}} and physicist, extensively researched conscious sensations and {{different types of}} perception [...] He defined sensations as the [...] "raw elements" [...] of conscious experience that required no learning, and perceptions as the meaningful interpretations derived from the senses. He studied the physical properties of the eye and vision, as well as acoustic sensation. In one of his classic experiments regarding how <b>space</b> <b>perception</b> could be altered by experience, participants wore glasses that distorted the visual field by several degrees to the right. Participants were asked to look at an object, close their eyes, and try {{to reach out and}} touch it. At first, the subjects reached for the object too far to the left, but after a few trials were able to correct themselves.|$|E
50|$|Functionalism and the University of Chicago's {{psychology}} program grew tremendously under Carr's influence. He {{went from}} his position as assistant professor {{all the way to}} chairman of the department, where he held his position from 1926-1938. During these years, he supervised graduate students with theses in various areas of psychology. He stated that 131 degrees were touched by his influence, 53 of those being doctoral dissertations under his direct supervision. He was involved in many psychological committees, and held positions as editor for the Journal of Experimental Psychology and the Journal of General Psychology. His writings, of which there are over 50, are influential and varied. He authored two books entitled Psychology, a Study of Mental Activity (1925) and An Introduction to Visual <b>Space</b> <b>Perception</b> (1935). He became president of the APA in 1927, giving an address entitled, Interpretation of the animal mind. He held a similar position in the Midwestern Psychological Association in 1937. In 1938, Carr became professor emeritus. In the years following his retirement, Carr devoted his energy primarily to students in the department rather than on publishing.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the graphic}} and {{interactive}} limitations of video games hindered their development and usefulness until the 1990s, when {{companies such as}} Nintendo and Sony began to produce three dimensional polygon graphics to produce the concept of “virtual reality.” This improved more {{with the introduction of}} Wii systems what allowed more realistic manipulation of the virtual reality through motion sensors. Studies at this time showed that the new interaction method improved coordination and <b>space</b> <b>perception.</b> The advances also allowed the technology to move from “game” to “simulator.” DaVinci Surgical System programmed their first simulator for laparoscopic surgery in 2005, and its accuracy and design made it quickly accepted by surgeons. While most of this technology has been used for general surgical training, it has also been used to plan specific surgeries as well. The first virtual surgery (where actual surgery followed the virtual practice) was performed on 17 August 2009 when Dr. David Clarke in Halifax, Nova Scotia removed a brain tumour 24 hours after removing a simulated tumour. By 2010, numerous hospitals had some kind of simulation technology available for medical professionals, especially for the training of laparoscopic procedures.|$|E

This collection of tests was based on over twenty years' research into object and spatial perception in people with damage confined {{to one side of}} the brain. Although the tests were originally devised to investigate theoretical issues, they have excellent selectivity and sensitivity in a clinical context leading to their wide adoption. The VOSP tests were designed to place limited demands on other cognitive abilities and are generally easy for people without brain disorders. Some VOSP tests have been incorporated into other test batteries (e.g., The Rookwood Driving Battery) and they have also influenced other screening measures (e.g., The ACE-R). There are eight untimed tests in the VOSP that can be given either separately or as a whole. The scores obtained in a testing session can be compared with those obtained by people with brain injuries and with controls. The VOSP is widely used by clinical and research psychologists and has featured in over 250 research publications. The VOSP can be purchased from Pearson for around the price of 230.00 USD.|$|E
