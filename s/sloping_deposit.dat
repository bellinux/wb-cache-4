40|$|AbstractThe {{hydrological}} {{response of}} a shallow <b>sloping</b> <b>deposit</b> in unsaturated pyroclastic soils is being monitored since 2002. The area {{is located in}} Cervinara, Campania Region (Southern Italy), where a catastrophic flowslide occurred on December 16 th, 1999, {{as a consequence of}} a 2 -day cumulative rainfall of 320 mm causing heavy damage and five deaths. The installed devices provide information about rainfall height, soil suction and, recently, also about volumetric water content at several locations and depths along the slope. The huge number and high quality of data allowed to develop a consistent model about the hydrological slope response and particularly to correlate the antecedent long-term precipitations with the soil matric suction {{at the beginning of a}} potential triggering rainfall, focusing on the hydrological conditions that establish in the different seasons. In particular, this can help in assessing the likely initial suction values at the time of a potential triggering rainstorm...|$|E
50|$|Stratified <b>slope</b> <b>deposits</b> {{can form}} in non-periglacial environments, {{meaning that the}} {{presence}} of stratified <b>slope</b> <b>deposit</b> is not unequivocal evidence for past periglaciation. The reason for the occurrence of stratified <b>slope</b> <b>deposits</b> outside present or past periglacial areas {{is that many of the}} processes that lead to their formation are azonal.|$|R
50|$|Periglacial {{stratified}} <b>slope</b> <b>deposits</b> form {{typically in}} periglacial areas that lack permafrost. Pleistocene-aged stratified <b>slope</b> <b>deposits</b> formed from stone-banked solifluction lobes.

50|$|Stratified <b>slope</b> <b>deposits</b> or grèzes litées (original French name) are accumulations {{of debris}} that are {{traditionally}} associated with periglaciation {{but that can}} also form in other settings. The deposits have a weak sorting and a coarse bedding. Stratified <b>slope</b> <b>deposits</b> are usually found at the lower slopes of valleys where thicknesses vary but may exceed 10 meters.

30|$|Through the {{examination}} of both R and grain-size distributions (Fig.  12), distinctive differences between beach and <b>slope</b> <b>deposits</b> are revealed. In order to compare {{the characteristics of the}} different deposits, a plot of the mean values and ranges between the first and third quartiles is shown for all samples in Fig.  12. This diagram shows clearly that the areas in which the beach <b>deposits</b> and <b>slope</b> <b>deposits</b> plot are completely separate. The beach deposits had high R values and ranged from coarse-grained sands to granules. In contrast, the <b>slope</b> <b>deposits</b> had low R values and ranged in size from granules to pebbles. These distinct variations imply that there is a significant difference in cumulative energy between the two deposit types. The beach deposits comprise particles that are highly abraded by wave action and beach drift transport, whereas the <b>slope</b> <b>deposits</b> were comparatively unaffected by such physical abrasion. Therefore, the new roundness parameter R can be considered helpful for the study of sedimentary processes and the estimation of particle origins.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the gravity process of recent landslides it is important to explore fossil landslides, which occurred during the near and distant geological past. Fossil, especially sub recent landslides can show us unstable and potentially dangerous areas to which we should pay attention today. A unique insight into different slope processes in nature is certainly Rebrnice area, where you can research the characteristics of the fossil landslides while observing the activity of the recent landslidess. The <b>slope</b> <b>deposit</b> in the Rebrnice area were described and mapped by many authors but nobody has covered the transport mechanisms and depositional processes of quaternary <b>slope</b> <b>deposit</b> in detail. This doctoral thesis presents the study of <b>slope</b> <b>deposit</b> elaborated with the geologicalgeomorphological approach. With the visual interpretation of the shaded digital elevation model and indicator of surface roughness, which are calculated from the data of airborne laser scanning in the combination of geological mapping, we can in most cases clearly identify the form of the prevalence and surface characteristics of individual sedimentary bodies. On the basis of the lithological, stratigraphic and architectural characteristics of the <b>slope</b> <b>deposit</b> 16 facies were separated, indicating the final articles of diverse sedimentary processes within complex and often interlaced and interdependent transport mechanisms. Results described in this work, and a comprehensive review of the available data and literature have made it possible to understand the transport mechanisms and the depositional processes of quaternary <b>slope</b> <b>deposit</b> in the Rebrnice area and thereby allow new insight into slope movement throughout the northern area of the Vipava Valley...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a sequence of}} stratified quartzite <b>slope</b> <b>deposits</b> and alluvial fan gravels from a small catchment at Rocky Cape. A lower series of indurated <b>slope</b> <b>deposits</b> overlain by a podzol soil profile suggests that cold climatic conditions, which favoured frost fracturing of exposed 13 rock surfaces and gelifluction of detritus, occurred prior to the Last Glacial Stage. An upper series of unconsolidated <b>slope</b> <b>deposits</b> contains wedge structures. These deposits appear to have resulted from frost fracturing and to have been moved downslope by gelifluction processes. The wedge structures may have been produced by seasonal freezing of the ground surface {{during the period of}} maximum cold in the Last Glacial Stage (after 22, 000 and before 10, 000 BP). Radiocarbon dating of charcoal and wood from organic horizons and a buried soil in the lower part of a thick sequence of alluvial fan gravels shows that they began to accumulate mainly between about 33, 000 and 22, 000 BP, when strong but episodic erosion of the open Eucalyptus forested catchment occurred. The upper part of the alluvial fan gravels does not contain organic horizons but probably accumulated after 22, 000 and before 10, 000 BP. The gravels were largely derived from the upper series of <b>slope</b> <b>deposits</b> which were formed in a non-forested environment...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the processes active in the frost environment of high subequatorial mountains {{makes it possible to}} propose a model for the stratification of <b>slope</b> <b>deposits.</b> Bedding is generated by solifluction sheets which move at the speed of a few cm y- 1. Solifluction involves needle ice, frost creep and gelifluction, and the ground thikness concerned is less than 20 cm. Sorting takes place by frost heaving. Coarse particles are concentrated {{at the front of the}} sheets, where matrix materials tend to be washed away, and are then buried by the advancing fine layer. Sedimentary characteristics allo recognition of several diagnostic features which can be used to indicate the origin of bedding in relic <b>slope</b> <b>deposits</b> situated in mid-latitudes. This model offers an alternative to earlier concepts of the stratification of <b>slope</b> <b>deposits,</b> but further studies are required, since other processes may also generate similar bedding geatures.

40|$|<b>Slope</b> <b>deposits</b> drilled during Leg 67 {{were later}} {{detailed}} in redisplayed seismic-reflection records. These deposits are of significantly lower seismic velocity and probably lower density than the underlying basement. This relationship indicates a contact between rocks of differing consolidation {{rather than a}} continuous sedimentary sequence. The <b>slope</b> <b>deposits</b> cover basement terranes of three different topographies. The shelf edge is an arch whose seaward flank forms a steep (up to 15 °) upper slope. The midslope area has a rugged topography covered by thick <b>slope</b> <b>deposits.</b> The lower <b>slope</b> is relatively smooth except where broken locally by benches. The upper and middle slope areas are associated with strong magnetic anomalies and rare, landward-dipping reflections truncated by the rough surface. The rough midslope topography may reflect erosion succeeding the Paleocene uplift of this area and at least local subsidence in the early Miocene. <b>Slope</b> <b>deposits</b> covered the Trench landward slope, contemporaneous with the increased arc volcanism indicated by ash layers and with the present period of subduction. The subducting ocean crust and sediment of the Cocos Plate has a linear horst and graben topography of hundreds of meters relief that disappears beneath the landward slope of the Trench without disturbing its topography. This passive assimilation of oceanic material without significant accretion in the late Neogene argues for significant decoupling {{at the front of}} the subduction zone. A base of gas-hydrate reflection is evident in many of the redisplayed seismic records off Guatemala. These reflections are most common where <b>slope</b> <b>deposits</b> are thick; the reflections have not been identified in the underlying acoustic basement. This observation is consistent with the geochemical evidence that gas hydrate has its source in the organic- rich slope sediment. The hydrate depth and the temperature measurements in drill holes indicate a temperature gradient of 30 °C/km...|$|R

40|$|The {{scientific}} Global Change {{debate is}} {{hampered by the}} insufficient knowledge of "greenhouse gas" fluxes. Thereby, extrapolations of global warming potentials of soil derived trace gas fluxes arc sources of greatest uncertainties. At single ecosystems gas fluxes still show highly variable thus hardly predictable fluxes. Our main thesis was that geomorphology helps to explain much of the variability even at this detailed scale, i. e. under rather uniform ecological condition {{as seen from the}} surface. This thesis was tested at a site in Wildmooswald (Black Forest/SW-Germany) where recently soil individual fluxes were identified, but not the cause of the formation of such diverse and mainly hydromorphic pedosphere. The idea was that the periglacial <b>slope</b> <b>deposits</b> including a water-logging layer form a more complex relief than the present rather uniform relief. Thus explaining the diverging sod water and gas balances. The water-logging layer was mapped by a regular auger grid (25 X 20 m). The Global Warming Potential (CH 4, N 2 O) was calculated by gas specific warming potential and area proportion of each soil type. Upper and lower relied were not congruent, thus the relief of periglacial <b>slope</b> <b>deposits</b> is explaining the spatial variability of N 2 O and CH 4 emissions. The study field emitted 1, 059 kg of CO 2 equivalents ha a(- 1) in average, whereas most estimates not considering the spatial distribution of the puriglacial <b>slope</b> <b>deposits</b> would be around 355 kg not capable of explaining measured high spatial variability.

40|$|The name Lawsonian Stage is {{proposed}} {{as the highest}} stage of the Cambrian System (Stage 10). The base of the proposed Lawsonian Stage is at the First Appearance Datum (FAD) of the euconodont Eoconodontus notchpeakensis (Miller, 1969). That horizon, {{the base of the}} E. notchpeakensis Subzone of the Eoconodontus Zone, is 3 mabove the base of the Red Tops Member of the Notch Peak Formation at the Steamboat Pass section in the House Range, western Utah, USA. The conodont fauna of the Eoconodontus Zone is widespread in North America and occurs in Asia, Australia, Europe, and South America in facies that include cratonic nearshore sandstones, shallow and intermediate-depth platform carbonates, deep-water ramp, continental <b>slope</b> <b>deposits,</b> and deep-ocean radiolarian chert.

40|$|Summary We {{employed}} a Mohr-Coulomb safety factor equation {{to assess the}} response of ice-cemented slopes in the stable upland zone of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV) to artificial increases in mean summertime soil surface temperatures (MSSST). Results show that ice-rich, silty tills on slopes 20 ° could fail by planar sliding with an in-crease in MSSST of ~ 5 º to 9 ºC. This change corresponds to an atmospheric increase of ~ 5 º to 9 ºC, which lies just outside the envelope of warming predicted to occur in this region over the next century. If we assume that current soil-moisture conditions {{can be applied to}} <b>slope</b> <b>deposits</b> in the distant past, and that these <b>slope</b> <b>deposits</b> have re-mained physically stable for millions of years, then our results suggest that MSSST in the upland zone did not in-crease by more than ~ 5 º to 9 ºC since deposition of most deposits, perhaps as much as 10 million years ago...|$|R
40|$|A {{continuum}} of carbon, from atmospheric CO 2 to secondary calcium carbonate, {{has been studied}} in a soil associ- ated with scree <b>slope</b> <b>deposits</b> in the Jura Mountains of Switzerland. This approach is based on former studies conducted in other environments. This C continuum includes atmospheric CO 2, soil organic matter (SOM), soil CO 2, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in soil solutions, and secondary pedogenic carbonate. Soil parameters (pCO 2, temperature, pH, Cmin and Corg contents), soil solution chemistry, and isotopic compositions of soil CO 2, DIC, carbonate and soil organic matter (δ 13 CCO 2, δ 13 CDIC, δ 13 Ccar and δ 13 CSOM values) have been monitored at different depths (from 20 to 140 cm) over one year. Results demonstrated that the carbon source in secondary carbonate (mainly needle fiber calcite) {{is related to the}} dissolved inorganic carbon, which is strongly dependent on soil respiration. The heterotrophic respiration, rather than the limestone parent material, seems to control the pedogenic carbon cycle. The correlation of δ 13 Corg values with Rock-Eval HI and OI indices demonstrates that, in a soil associated to scree <b>slope</b> <b>deposits,</b> the main process responsible for 13 C-enrichment in SOM is related to bac- terial oxidative decarboxylation. Finally, precipitation of secondary calcium carbonate is enhanced by changes in soil pCO 2 associated to the convective movement of air masses induced by temperature gradients (heat pump effect) in the highly porous scree <b>slope</b> <b>deposits.</b> The exportation of soil C-leachates from systems such as the one studied in this paper could partially explain the "gap in the European carbon budget" reported by recent studies...|$|R

40|$|The human {{settlement}} of Europe during Pleistocene times was sporadic and several stages have been recognized, both from paleaoanthropological and archaeological records. If {{the first phase}} of hominin occupation (as early as 1. 4 Ma) seems mainly restricted to {{the southern part of the}} continent, the second phase, characterized by specific lithic tools (handaxes), is linked to Acheulean settlements and to the emergence of Homo heidelbergensis, the ancestor of Neanderthals. This phase reached northwestern Europe and is documented in numerous sites in Germany, Great Britain and northern France, generally after 600 ka. At la Noira (Brinay, Central France), the Middle Pleistocene alluvial formation of the Cher River covers an archaeological level associated with a <b>slope</b> <b>deposit</b> (diamicton). The lithic assemblage from this level includes Large Cutting Tools (LCTs), flakes and cores, associated with numerous millstone slabs. The lithic series is classified as Acheulean on the basis of both technological and typological analyses. Cryoturbation features indicate that the <b>slope</b> <b>deposits</b> and associated archaeological level were strongly frozen and disturbed after hominin occupation and before fluvial deposition. Eight sediment samples were dated by the electron spin resonance (ESR) method and the weighted average age obtained for the fluvial sands overlying the <b>slope</b> <b>deposits</b> is 665 ± 55 ka. This age is older than previous chronological data placing the first European Acheulean assemblages north of 45 (th) parallel north at around 500 ka and modifies our current vision of the initial peopling of northern Europe. Acheulean settlements are older than previously assumed and the oldest evidences are not only located in southern Europe. La Noira is the oldest evidence of Acheulean presence in north-western Europe and attests to the possibility of pioneering phases of Acheulean settlement which would have taken place on a Mode 1 -type substratum as early as 700 ka. The lithic assemblage from la Noira thus provides behavioral and technological data on early Acheulean occupation in Europe and contributes to our understanding of the diffusion of this tradition...|$|R

In this 2008 study, water quality was compared and contrasted between Parsons’ Spring and other sites in the study catchment and a resurgence in a nearby reference catchment over different flow conditions {{and in response to}} a rainstorm.

Most probably in the Early Holocene, the re-emergence of monsoonal rains led to a strong erosion phase, which was followed by an extended stable phase with soil formation, building up about 70 -cm-deep A-horizons (Andosol) on the paleo-periglacial <b>slope</b> <b>deposits.</b> These soils have been heavily degraded due to human-induced soil erosion up to about 3800 m asl since agriculture started several decades to millennia ago...|$|R
