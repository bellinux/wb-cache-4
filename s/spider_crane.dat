40|$|A space <b>spider</b> <b>crane</b> for the movement, placement, and or {{assembly}} of various components on {{or in the}} vicinity of a space structure is described. As permanent space structures are utilized by the space program, a means will be required to transport cargo and perform various repair tasks. A space <b>spider</b> <b>crane</b> comprising a small central body with attached manipulators and legs fulfills this requirement. The manipulators may be equipped with constant pressure gripping end effectors or tools to accomplish various repair tasks. The legs are also equipped with constant pressure gripping end effectors to grip the space structure. Control of the space <b>spider</b> <b>crane</b> may be achieved either by computer software or a remotely situated human operator, who maintains visual contact via television cameras mounted on the space <b>spider</b> <b>crane.</b> One possible walking program consists of a parallel motion walking program whereby the small central body alternatively leans forward and backward relative to end effectors...|$|E
2500|$|Some species, {{especially}} Pholcus phalangioides, {{are commonly}} called daddy long-legs spider, granddaddy long-legs spider, carpenter spider, daddy long-legger, or vibrating spider. Confusion often arises because the name [...] "daddy long-legs" [...] is also applied to two distantly related arthropod groups: the harvestmen (which are arachnids but not <b>spiders),</b> and <b>crane</b> flies (which are insects).|$|R
5|$|The common {{starling}} {{is largely}} insectivorous and feeds on both pest and other arthropods. The food range includes <b>spiders,</b> <b>crane</b> flies, moths, mayflies, dragonflies, damsel flies, grasshoppers, earwigs, lacewings, caddisflies, flies, beetles, sawflies, bees, wasps and ants. Prey are consumed in both adult and larvae stages of development, and common starlings will also feed on earthworms, snails, small amphibians and lizards. While {{the consumption of}} invertebrates is necessary for successful breeding, common starlings are omnivorous and can also eat grains, seeds, fruits, nectar and food waste if the opportunity arises. The Sturnidae differ from most birds in that they cannot easily metabolise foods containing high levels of sucrose, although they can cope with other fruits such as grapes and cherries. The isolated Azores subspecies of the common starling eats the eggs of the endangered roseate tern. Measures are being introduced to reduce common starling populations by culling before the terns return to their breeding colonies in spring.|$|R
