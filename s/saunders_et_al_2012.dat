30|$|With {{regard to}} the “needle removal” category, one can {{distinguish}} between use errors related to removal of the needle from the device, and those related to removal of the needle from the skin. In the “incorrect removal from device” subcategory, two publications reported that users did not remove the needle from the device after an injection (Fujioka et al., 2015; Jeannerot et al., 2016). The other two references for this subcategory described that users did not unscrew the needle from the device with the needle cap, as was recommended (Schertz et al., 2011; <b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2012).</b> For the “incorrect removal from skin” subcategory, two references were identified (Schertz et al., 2011; <b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2012).</b> However, neither gave any further information about this use error.|$|E
30|$|The “dosage” {{category}} encompasses all errors {{related to}} checking the dose {{before or after}} the injection, the calculation or interpretation of remaining doses, and errors in the dose setup process itself. Errors related to an “incorrect dose setting” were most common. These refer to either setting up an incorrect dose (Stauder et al., 2014; Fujioka et al., 2015; Rohrer et al., 2013; Jeannerot et al., 2016; Lange et al., 2014; Schertz et al., 2011; Pfützner et al., 2012; Mahony et al., 2015; <b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2012)</b> or not setting a dose at all (Fujioka et al., 2015; Rohrer et al., 2013). A close call was also reported in this context: an incorrect dial-up of the remaining dose, which was corrected before the injection (Mahony et al., 2015). For the “dose misinterpretation/miscalculation” category, three publications were identified. One publication reported that users either misjudged the number of doses left in the disposable pen injector or could not determine this number (Stauder et al., 2014). Another publication reported that users miscalculated the doses when an injection had to be split across two devices because the medication remaining in a single pen injector would not be enough to deliver a complete dose (Fujioka et al., 2015). In this context, it was also reported that users did not realize that the device could not be set to give the required split dose because the device did not contain enough medication or was already empty (Jeannerot et al., 2016). Furthermore, one publication mentioned a close call in the context of split-dose calculation; the error was corrected by referring to the IFU before performing the injection (Mahony et al., 2015). Three publications reported that users failed to check the dose on the device prior to an injection (Stauder et al., 2014; Schertz et al., 2011; <b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2012).</b> Four publications mentioned that users failed to visually confirm after an injection that the correct dose had been administered (Phillips et al., 2011; Hudry et al., 2017; Schertz et al., 2011; <b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2012).</b>|$|E
30|$|In {{terms of}} {{validity}} of the research findings, also known as generalizability, which refers {{to the extent to}} which the findings can be applied to other research settings, <b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2012)</b> argued that it is difficult for any researcher to assure complete validity or generalizability. However, a degree of confidence in the research findings can be assured if the sample is representative. A representative sample is one that can be considered valid for the entire population. Therefore, in order to assure an acceptable level of confidence in the findings of this research, the interviews targeted five service organizations registered officially at the ASE. Interviews also targeted the headquarters only in order to obtain a more homogenous sample. In addition, the respondents interviewed had direct responsibility for BCM and were considered as key people in managing continuity in their organizations.|$|E
30|$|Malnutrition {{is defined}} by the American Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) as any “any {{nutritional}} imbalance” (White <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2012,</b> p. 730). More specifically, malnutrition can refer to a state of under-nutrition (from insufficient intake or impaired utilisation), or over-nutrition (from excessive calorie intake and/or inadequate physical activity) (Escott-Stump 2012). Either state leads to altered body composition and function (<b>Saunder</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2010). It is important however, that the term ‘under-nutrition’ is not confused with being underweight (e.g. often represented by Body Mass Index [BMI] < 18.5  kg/m 2). Under-nutrition is a term used synonymously with protein-energy deficiency, where there is a loss of body cell mass with signs of subcutaneous fat loss and skeletal muscle wasting and therefore (Escott-Stump 2012; <b>Saunder</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2010); under-nutrition can occur irrespective of individuals’ BMI (<b>Saunder</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2010). Malnutrition, in this study protocol, refers to ‘under-nutrition’, meaning protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) (Escott-Stump 2012).|$|R

30|$|The {{selection}} {{of these organizations}} was {{made on the basis}} of simple random sampling. The advantage of using simple random sampling is that it allows all elements of the entire population (in our case, those represent all service organizations registered with ASE) to have equal selection probability, that is, all elements within the population are equally likely to be selected (<b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2012).</b> Simple random sampling was performed using a random sampling generator (many of these are freely available online). The sampling generator was configured in a way that allowed one company to be selected from each of the five major leading groups of companies that comprise the services sector in Jordan: telecommunications and IT; transportation; media; financial; and the hotel, food, and beverage services. This was the reason for choosing five companies for the purpose of this research.|$|E

As expected, {{comorbidity}} with ED {{was associated}} with female gender and earlier age at onset of BD {{by an average of}} 3.3  years. We found, however, a striking difference between the patterns of onset with anxiety compared to alcohol use comorbidities. The age at onset of anxiety disorders in the ED group was almost 6  years before non-ED population, specifically social phobia and specific phobia. Anxiety disorders occurred before the average onset of ED, even the earliest of the ED diagnoses, AN. BN and BED occurred in late adolescence and coincided with the onset of alcoholism. However, the age at onset of alcohol use disorders was very similar to the non-ED population. We therefore postulate that individuals with a predilection to BD and ED have a high likelihood of anxiety in adolescence, followed by development of BD, then ED, and then alcohol use disorder. Alcohol use disorder is often a coping mechanism for anxiety and mood symptoms and is particularly a high risk for females with BD and anxiety disorders (<b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2012).</b> Understanding this sequence of vulnerability can be useful in clinically caring for adolescents, particularly females, with anxiety disorders and bipolar disorder.|$|E
40|$|Quite {{often the}} {{approach}} adopted by tutors {{to the teaching}} and learning of research methodology at undergraduate and, sometimes even at postgraduate level, is to teach students to be able to set a question and to go about trying to answer it in the way of research. This is a pragmatic approach to an important area of scholarship which deserves something more special than what is being provided in frequently used books on research methods (see Easterby-Smith et al 2002; <b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al</b> <b>2012).</b> Given the simplistic nature of this approach teaching and learning how to become competent researchers has been reduced to teaching students to know basic methods about setting and refining research questions, negotiating access to data collection, ways of presenting and analysing data and arriving at conclusions that answer one’s research question or validates a hypothesis. The literature (Lakatos 1999; Popper 1972) shows that there is more to becoming a successful researcher other than teaching novices some simple research techniques and some limitations to those techniques. If novice researchers are to become more sophisticated in research methodology, those who are responsible for this developmental activity ought to embrace deeper learning of some of the beliefs, values and assumptions that provide the bedrock of academic research education. This paper problematizes some of the approaches currently used by colleagues to develop {{the teaching and learning}} of research methodology within university education. The paper posits that for researchers to become more sophisticated in their trade, a deeper appreciation of the assumptions that underpin research methodology needs to be fostered in what novice researchers think about and how they practice research methodology...|$|E
30|$|SIRT 1 {{expression}} {{levels have}} been reported to be higher in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) as compared to the differentiated cells (<b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2010). This phenomenon has been attributed to post-transcriptional downregulation of SIRT 1 by a range of miRNAs, such as miR- 9, miR- 181 a and b, and others (<b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2010). Interestingly, the authors also reported an induction in SIRT 1 protein levels when the MEFs were reprogrammed into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Recently, SIRT 1 has been implicated in the maintenance of mESCs self-renewal by being directly regulated viamiR- 29 b in response to reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Xu <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2014). In addition, SIRT 1 has been reported {{to be involved in the}} maintenance of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) homeostasis and lineage specification, where loss of SIRT 1 in HSCs garnered DNA damage, accumulation of age-linked molecules and other phenotypes of aging HSCs (Rimmelé <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2014).Intriguingly, overexpression of SIRT 1 or its activation by resveratrol is reported to rescue senescence-associated phenotypes and also angiogenic defects in preterm-endothelial colony forming progenitor cells (PT-ECFCs) (Vassallo <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2014). To add to this, overexpression of SIRT 1 also delays senescence in the bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (B-MSCs) (Yuan <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2012).</b> Further, cleavage of SIRT 1 by cathepsin triggers stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) in endothelial progenitor cells (Chen <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2012).</b> On the whole, SIRT 1 stands out as a prominent housekeeper of maintaining stemness by resisting senescence in the cells.|$|R
3000|$|Bipolar {{disorder}} (BD) is an episodic, often disabling {{disorder of}} mood, energy, and cognition {{that has a}} high level of comorbidity with other psychiatric conditions including anxiety disorders (Simon <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2004; <b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2012; Potash <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2007) and substance abuse (Merikangas <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2008; <b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2009; Potash <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2007) and often results in suicidal ideation and attempts (Chen and Dilsaver 1996; Goodwin and Jamison 2007; Potash <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2007) and psychosis (Potash <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2007; Potash <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2003). Comorbidity with eating disorders (ED), including anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge eating disorder (BED), is a relatively understudied area that may illuminate opportunities for improved treatment for those with both disorders. EDs collectively include an alteration in hunger and satiation cues and overvaluing the role of body size and shape in self-image. Data demonstrate high comorbidity between BD and various EDs, especially among females (Fornaro <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2010; McElroy <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2011; Brietzke <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2011; Seixas <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2012).</b> The estimated prevalence of ED in BD has varied widely but ranges between 6 % and 27 % in BD, many times greater than the population prevalence of 3.6 % to 10 % (McElroy <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2005 [...]...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Road {{accidents}} {{contribute significantly}} to child mortality and injuries in South Africa. One way in which countries around the world, including South Africa, are {{trying to deal with}} the problem is through promoting the use of child car restraints. Despite this, use of child car restraints is noted to be low. This study examines parent and carer beliefs, attitude and behavioural intentions towards safe child passenger travel, particularly as this relates to use of child car restraints. The study utilises the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and the Health Belief Model (HBM) to propose a conceptual model that can be used to assist in explaining behavioural intentions towards use of child car restraints. The study follows a quantitative research approach to address the presented objectives. The research process put forward by <b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2012)</b> is followed. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data from parents and carers of children up to 8 years old. The data was collected in areas within three main regions of Gauteng: namely, Johannesburg, Ekurhuleni and Tshwane. 261 questionnaires were collected, of which 253 were usable. The data is analysed using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Science). The results show that parents and carers had a positive attitude and positive behavioural intentions towards use of child car restraints. The results further indicate that attitudes towards use of child car restraints is influenced by perceived susceptibility, perceived benefit, perceived barriers, perceived seriousness, and subjective norm. It is also found that knowledge of legal requirements, knowledge of use as well as attitude all have a positive influence on behavioural intentions towards use of child car restraints. M. Com.

30|$|The “protective/safety cap” {{category}} includes use errors {{divided into}} four subcategories. “Incorrect needle capping after the injection” refers to cases in which users failed to cover or cap the needle after the injection or did not cover it as recommended. Four publications reported that users did not cap the needle after an injection (Phillips et al., 2011; Hudry et al., 2017; Schertz et al., 2011; <b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2012).</b> Two publications state that the needle capping was not done as recommended (Jeannerot et al., 2016; Mahony et al., 2015). For instance, they capped the needle using one hand, rather than two (Mahony et al., 2015). Removal of the protective/safety cap prior to an injection concerned cases in which users did not remove the cap at all, and {{cases in which the}} users did not remove the cap as recommended. For the first case (“cap not removed”), users were not aware that they had to do this, or they simply forgot to do so (Fujioka et al., 2015; Sicherer et al., 2000; Robinson et al., 2014; Matfin et al., 2015; Salter et al., 2014; Brown et al., 2013; Guerlain et al., 2010 a; Umasunthar et al., 2015; Bakirtas et al., 2011; Mehr et al., 2007; Arga et al., 2011; Topal et al., 2013; Hanna et al., 2016; Schmid et al., 2013; Rohrer et al., 2013; Hudry et al., 2017; Lange et al., 2014; Schertz et al., 2011; Guerlain et al., 2010 b; Andre et al., 2017). In the second case (“incorrect cap removal”), users either did not hold the device correctly during cap removal (Phillips et al., 2011; Brown et al., 2013), or used the wrong hand (Saleh-Langenberg et al., 2017). One publication mentioned that users removed the cap manually rather than by extending the device’s injector shield while they were pointing it away from the body (Phillips et al., 2011). Use errors related to “cap removed in wrong order” were solely reported for the two adrenaline auto-injectors Anapen (Salter et al., 2014) and Twinject (Guerlain et al., 2010 a), both of which have two safety caps.|$|E
30|$|The “injection” {{category}} encompasses all use errors {{directly related}} to the injection. The most frequently reported use error was an “incorrect duration of injection”. These errors are mostly related to an insufficient injection time, resulting in the administration of incomplete dosages. For instance, common adrenaline auto-injectors like the Anapen or EpiPen should be held in place for at least five seconds (Umasunthar et al., 2015; Bakirtas et al., 2011; Mehr et al., 2007; Arga et al., 2011; Hanna et al., 2016) to ensure complete delivery of the dose. In some studies of the Anapen/EpiPen, the recommended injection time was 10  s (Salter et al., 2014; Brown et al., 2013; Topal et al., 2013; Saleh-Langenberg et al., 2017). The users often failed to hold the device in place long enough while injecting, and thus failed to administer a full dose. Furthermore, we identified two instances of use errors related to an excessively long injection time (Schertz et al., 2011; <b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2012).</b> Creating a skin fold or pinching the skin is often recommended for the subcutaneous administration of medications. “Incorrect pinching/folding of skin for injection” refers to cases in which users failed to perform this action (Schiff et al., 2016) or did not do it as instructed (e.g. with the wrong fingers or not for the entire injection time) (Hudry et al., 2017). Another reported use error was “significant movement of the device during injection” (Guerlain et al., 2010 a). For the “performance of several injections with same needle/device” subcategory, two types of use error were identified. One publication reported that users tried to perform more than one injection with the same device (Guerlain et al., 2010 a). This study was a comparative evaluation of four different adrenaline auto-injector training devices. For one of the devices, the error was caused by incorrect feedback; the device continued to instruct the user to perform the injection even after they already had done so. For the other three devices, the reason was not stated. The other error included in this subcategory was related to a disposable pen injector that can deliver multiple dosages. In the corresponding study, participants failed to use a new needle for the second injection (Jeannerot et al., 2016). Another frequently reported injection-related error was the use of an “incorrect injection site”. For instance, adrenaline/epinephrine should be administered intramuscularly - preferable in the outer aspect of thigh. In the corresponding publications, however, some injections were not intramuscular or were performed in muscles other than those of the outer thigh (Sicherer et al., 2000; Salter et al., 2014; Brown et al., 2013; Guerlain et al., 2010 a; Bakirtas et al., 2011; Mehr et al., 2007; Arga et al., 2011; Topal et al., 2013; Saleh-Langenberg et al., 2017; Schmid et al., 2013).|$|E
30|$|O’Neil <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>2012)</b> {{summarised}} {{studies and}} meta-analyses {{on the treatment}} of pain {{with a focus on}} falls as adverse drug reaction. A meta-analysis found that patients exposed to central acting analgesics (opioids) had a 38 % increased risk of fractures compared to non-treated controls (Takkouche <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2007). Comparing peripheral acting analgesics (NSAID) and opioids in older adults with arthritis revealed a five-fold increased risk of fracture in those using opioids. (Miller <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2011). Two studies detected a dose dependence, where the risk of falls increased with higher doses of opioids (Muraki <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2013; <b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2010). The risk of falling increased also if opioids were used with non-opioid analgesics. One analysis was conducted with regard to gait balance problems (Buckeridge <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2010). Whether the falls originated from the analgesics or from the underlying disease remained unanswered. Most studies were unable to control for pain severity which could have had an important confounding effect (O’Neil <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2012).</b> Patients that received a prescription for opioids were treated for moderate to severe pain, while NSAID’s were generally used to treat only mild pain (Schwabe and Paffrath 2014).|$|R

30|$|The “preparation” {{category}} encompasses all use {{errors that}} can occur while setting up a device for an injection. This includes required checks on the device and liquid contained therein. For the “incorrect needle attachment” subcategory, two types of errors were defined. Six publications stated that users did not attach a needle to the auto-injection device (Stauder et al., 2014) or did not attach the needle correctly (Stauder et al., 2014; Fujioka et al., 2015; Lange et al., 2014; Schertz et al., 2011; Pfützner et al., 2012; Pfützner et al., 2010). With {{the exception of one}} publication (which reported that the needle was attached at the wrong angle (Lange et al., 2014)), no further information about these use errors was provided. The other error in this subcategory is related to the fact that users failed to hold the device in the required upright position during the needle attachment (Phillips et al., 2011). The “incorrect priming” subcategory refers to use errors related to checking for and removing air bubbles or performing a flow check. Four publications reported that users did not check for or remove an air bubble when present (Fujioka et al., 2015; Jeannerot et al., 2016; Lange et al., 2014; Schertz et al., 2011). One of those publications mentioned that participants did not set the device to the minimum dosage, as recommended for the priming process (Jeannerot et al., 2016). Another publication stated that the cartridge of the used device was not tapped before priming or that the needle was pointing downwards during priming (Lange et al., 2014). Furthermore, one publication reported that users primed the device twice (Stauder et al., 2014). In the latter study, participants had to perform several injections; the error was related to the fact that users unnecessarily primed the device again after the first injection. This publication also reported that users primed directly into the injection pad, rather than into a cup as recommended. With regard to the “incorrect device selection” subcategory, two publications mentioned that participants used the wrong device. In one study, participants had to pick up the correct auto-injector from a fridge containing several comparator product boxes (Fujioka et al., 2015). In the other study, participants used a training device instead of the real auto-injector (Raffa et al., 2017). The “failure to check device integrity” subcategory refers to cases in which users did not check whether the auto-injector was damaged (Schiff et al., 2016) or whether the tamper-evident seal was intact (Hudry et al., 2017). Two publications reported that users failed to check the integrity of the outer needle cap (Schertz et al., 2011; <b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2012).</b> With regard to the “failure to check product validity” subcategory, three publications mentioned that users failed to check the indicated expiration date (Schiff et al., 2016) or were carrying devices that had expired (Sicherer et al., 2000; Schmid et al., 2013). Furthermore, two publications reported that users failed to check the liquid (Hudry et al., 2017; Schiff et al., 2016). The last subcategory (“tampering with device”) refers to a publication that stated that users could not activate an injection because they had tampered with the device during its preparation (Andre et al., 2017).|$|E
30|$|Since {{symptoms}} of LIH such as fatigue, weakness, and depression can {{be similar to}} the {{symptoms of}} the mood disorder for which lithium therapy was initiated, this may cause a significant doctor’s delay in the diagnosis of LIH when misinterpreted (Khandwala and Van Uum 2006; Houweling <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2012; Rizwan and Perrier 2009). The exact pathophysiology by which LIH develops is still unknown. Lithium may induce LIH directly or only unmask or accelerate a previously unnoticed hyperparathyroidism (Birnbaum <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1988; Tupin <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1968; Gerner <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1977; Mellerup <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1976; Saxe and Gibson 1991; Saxe <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1995). There are no clear predictors to determine which patients are at risk for LIH. Furthermore, the way in which these patients should be treated is still a matter of debate. Discontinuation of lithium treatment, if possible, has been proven unsuccessful in most patients that have been using lithium for longer periods (Garfinkel <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1973; Bendz <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1996; Bendz <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> Järhult <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2010; <b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2009; Houweling <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2012).</b> Different surgical approaches of parathyroidectomy have been described, but calcimimetics or a ‘wait and see policy’ might be an alternative to surgery (Bendz <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1996; Ananth and Dubin 1983; Davis <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1981; Järhult <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2010; <b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2009; Christensson 1976; Szalat <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2009; Khandwala and Van Uum 2006; Houweling <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2012; Hundley <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2005; Sloand and Shelly 2006; Gregoor and de Jong 2007).|$|R

40|$|The European red fox (Vulpes vulpes) {{has been}} listed {{as one of}} the IUCN’s top 100 worst {{invasive}} alien species (Lowe <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2000). The species occurs naturally throughout the northern hemisphere, from North America through Europe, Asia, and the northernmost parts of Africa (<b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 1995). While native to North America, European red foxes were introduced to other areas of the continent and subsequently interbred with native stock. Australia contains the only southern hemisphere introduction of the species (<b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 1995). This systematic review will be restricted to operations undertaken to control fox populations in Australia only. The fox was introduced into Victoria, southern Australia, in the 1870 s for hunting purposes, and rapidly spread throughout the majority of all mainland states (Rolls, 1969). In 2001, they were detected in the island state of Tasmania for the first time, despite previous introduction attempts (<b>Saunders</b> <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> 2006).

30|$|The Apc (adenomatous {{polyposis}} coli) gene is {{the most}} commonly mutated tumor suppressor gene in sporadic colorectal cancer (Armaghany <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2012).</b> After Apc deletion, TfR 1 and DMT 1 protein levels are rapidly induced (Radulescu <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2012).</b> Conversely, restoration of APC reduces cellular iron due to repression of these two proteins (Radulescu <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2012).</b> Deficiency of luminal iron significantly suppresses murine intestinal tumorigenesis, whereas increased luminal iron strongly promotes tumorigenesis (Radulescu <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2012).</b> These results definitively delineate iron as a potent modifier of intestinal tumorigenesis (Radulescu <b>et</b> <b>al.,</b> <b>2012).</b>|$|R
30|$|Water {{pollution}} {{is one of}} the most serious environmental problems being faced by modern society (Marques <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2000; Ruiz-Manriquez <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1998). Heavy metals are known for their non-degradability and toxicity. It is, therefore, essential to control their discharge into water bodies and natural streams. Cadmium is highly toxic and non-essential metal which is released into the environment by various ways such as photographic development, ceramic, alkaline batteries, electroplating and metal plating works (Mohapatra and Anand 2007). Cadmium exposes human health to severe risks, due to its higher toxicity and can exert its toxic effects even at low concentrations. Occupational levels of cadmium exposure are a risk factor for chronic lung disease and testicular degradation (Benoff <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2000). Cadmium can also damage some specific structure of the functional units of the kidney (Satarug <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2000). Cadmium concentrations in unpolluted natural water are usually below 0.001  mg L− 1 (Friberg <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 1986) therefore it is necessary to remove cadmium from industry effluent. For this reason, it is significant to focus the attention on the development of improved friendly methods and low-cost adsorbents for toxic heavy metal removal. Various techniques are in use for the removal of heavy metals from the industrial discharge but adsorption technology has been found to show high efficiency in detoxifying effluents (Kenduzler and Turker 2005). Adsorption utilizes the ability to accumulate heavy metals from wastewater by either metabolically medium or physiochemical pathway of uptake (Fourest and Roux 1992). Natural materials have excellent potential as inexpensive adsorbents. Many adsorbents have been used in past years for cadmium ion removal, however, the exploration and development of new adsorbents is endless. Biomaterials such as Cashew nut shell (Kumar <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2012</b> a, b), Borassus aethiopum seed shells (Adie <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2012),</b> Modified corncob (Leyva-Ramos <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2012),</b> Chitosan (Hydari <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2012),</b> Agricultural wastes (Chao and Chang 2012), Seeds of Mast tree (Rao and Rehman 2012), Peganum harmala seeds (Zamani <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2013), Nylon- 6 (Prakash <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2012),</b> Calcite sludge (Merrikhpour and Jalali 2012), Rice straw (Ding <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2012),</b> Meranti wood (Rafatullah <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2012),</b> Nauclea diderrichii seed (Omorogie <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2012),</b> Modified Lawny grass (Chen <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> 2011), Acacia nilotica (Waseem <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2012),</b> Walnut shell (Almasi <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2012),</b> Grapefruit biomass (Bayo <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2012),</b> Macrocystis pyrifera (Cazon <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2012),</b> Algae (Sulaymon <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2012),</b> Modified Cashew nut shell (Kumar <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2012</b> a, b), Rice bran (Chen <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2012),</b> Sawdust (Bouziane <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2012),</b> Orange peel (Masoudi <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> <b>2012)</b> etc. have recently been utilized for the removal of Cd(II) from aqueous solution.|$|R
