40|$|We {{report the}} {{contamination}} {{rate in the}} Cambridge bone bank of 35 consecutive allograft specimens, all harvested in a clean-air environment, using a strict aseptic technique and antibiotic cover. Five of 27 femoral heads taken from living donors and three of eight massive allografts taken from cadavers {{were found to be}} contaminated. The contaminated femoral heads were discarded. All massive allografts were rendered sterile by gamma-irradiation. Itisimportant to exclude bacteriological contamination of harvested and banked bone. Bone transplantation has a long history. The Saints Cosmos and Damien, a physician and surgeon respec-tively, beheaded in AD 287 on the orders of the emperor Diocletian, are said to have replaced the tumorous lower limb of a churchwarden with the leg of a Moor who had died the same day (Mankin, Doppelt and Tomford 1983). In more recent times, bone has been stored by refrigeration for subsequent implantation and the pro-cedures for harvesting and storing it in bone banks have been well documented (Friedlander 1982). Considerable care is taken to ensure that the donor is free from <b>serious</b> <b>transmissible</b> <b>disease,</b> that the samples are sterile, and that proper records are maintained. There is a significant rate of infection {{associated with the use of}} massive bone allografts in revision and bone tumour surgery (Tomford et a! 1990).

40|$|For {{reasons of}} {{limiting}} {{the spread of}} <b>serious</b> <b>transmissible</b> <b>diseases,</b> {{with regard to the}} requirement for reducing landfill of biodegradable waste (which may or contains animal by-products and thus presents a potential risk to human and animal health) and with a focus on supporting its separate collection, there has been created a legal framework for processing and hygienization of materials containing animal by-products. For the above reasons new technologies are being developed and implemented. These technologies are able to ensure the processing of biological waste containing animal by-products. As a practical result of the effort to ensure the hygienization of biowaste, a hygienization unit of own design, which uses the thermal way of hygienization, is presented in this work. The general part of the work defines a legislative framework for the assignment and gives technical parameters and minimum requirements for conversion that hygienization unit should be able to perform, including the limits for digestion residues and compost. In the experimental section there are described operational tests which document the technological process of hygienization depending on the aeration of the contents of the reactor. Experiment III outlines the validation process which uses contamination by indicator organisms, including subsequent checking of their occurrence as well as processing of the results of experiments and evaluation of the process of hygienization...|$|R

A total of 24. 2 % of patients had serologic profiles suggesting past hepatitis B virus infection. Anti–human immunodeficiency virus antibodies were not detected in any subject.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyze quality of {{investigation}} and treatment in the specialized services – dermatological and sexually <b>transmissible</b> <b>diseases</b> outpatient department of the II Kaunas Clinical hospital and private health care institution “Medidermas”. Methods. Study population – patients with dermatological and sexually <b>transmissible</b> <b>diseases.</b> Randomly selected patients were interviewed in 2004 September-October. Totally 157 patients from state and 62 from private institution were investigated. MS Office Exel and EpiInfo 6. 0 packages were used in the statistical analysis. Results. Mean age of the investigated was 42. 5 ± 1. 1 yrs. One quarter of the investigated chose health care institution, recommended by familiar or friend, only 24 % applied to specialized departments with referrals. The majority of respondents (85. 5 %) of the private institution “Medidermas” were accepted after few days of registration, 38. 2 % (p< 0. 001) of the dermatological and sexually <b>transmissible</b> <b>diseases</b> outpatient department of the II Kaunas Clinical hospital were accepted after one or two weeks. 45. 2 % of the investigated in the private service were registered in the interval of 10 minutes, 43. 5 % - 15 minutes. In the state institution only 17. 8 % (p 0. 001) were registered during 10 minutes and half – 15 minutes. The respondents of “Medidermas” had a longer waiting time before acceptance to a medical doctor as compared to the state health care service (in 10 minutes 41. 9 % and 17. 3 %, p< 0. 001, respectively). 4 / 5 of the respondents of “Medidermas” had a visit to the doctor lasting 10 - 30 minutes, while 2 / 5 of patients of the state institution the visit to the doctor lasted only 10 - 15 minutes. 	The respondents in the private health care service institution were more satisfied with the interior order and keeping privacy as compared to the state health care institution. Female respondents of “Medidermas” were more satisfied with the competency of medical doctor, while male respondents were more satisfied in the state institution. Women with dermatological and sexually <b>transmissible</b> <b>diseases</b> in private institution preferred to accept positively the administered medication and their health status as compared to men and the respondents of the state health care institution. The majority of the respondents were satisfied with the facilities provided and the quality in health care, less satisfaction was documented among the patients in the dermatological and sexually <b>transmissible</b> <b>diseases</b> outpatient department of the II Kaunas Clinical hospital.

40|$|Introduction: Providing safe blood {{transfusion}} and blood derivates is of unique importance in contemporary medicine, {{taking into account}} that certain infections in the body are transmissible through the blood, its cell concentrates and plasma components. That is the reason why ascertainment of safe regulation for the way of taking the blood and its control is an important imperative and motive for preparation of this specialist’s work. Results: With all-embracing statistical analysis we succeeded to detect the most often infections which potentially can be transmitted to another body. The entire elaboration of the results of this work shows the percentage presence of HBsAg (1, 32 %), anti-HCV (0, 45 %), anti-HIV (0, 003 %) and Treponema pallidum (0, 10 %) at blood donor population of the determined transfusion <b>transmissible</b> <b>diseases</b> so far, vulnerable groups of blood donors (age, sex, predisposition to certain infections), the degree and efficiency of serological diagnostics applied in Regional Center for transfusion medicine in Shtip in the past 10 years and the way of prevention and additional education of people for spreading of transfusion <b>transmissible</b> <b>diseases.</b> Conclusion: These results (previously noted) indicate the needs of continuous serological diagnosis and obligatory testing of every blood unit with ELISA tests with high sensitivity and specificity, as well as undertaking of appropriate preventive measures with which the consequences of higher number of transfusion <b>transmissible</b> <b>diseases</b> will be reduced...|$|R
