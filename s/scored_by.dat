5|$|Eleven goaltenders {{have scored}} {{a total of}} {{fourteen}} goals in National Hockey League (NHL) games. A goalkeeper can score by either shooting the puck into the net, or being awarded the goal as the last player on his team to touch the puck when an opponent scored an own goal. A goal <b>scored</b> <b>by</b> shooting the puck is particularly challenging as the goaltender has to aim for a six-foot-wide net that is close to 180 feet away, while avoiding opposing defencemen; {{in the case of}} own goals, the combined circumstance of the own goal itself in addition to the goaltender being the last player to touch the puck makes it a very rare occurrence. Of the fourteen goals, seven were <b>scored</b> <b>by</b> shooting the puck and seven were the result of own goals.|$|E
