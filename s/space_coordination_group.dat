A key development objective identified by the International <b>Space</b> Exploration <b>Coordination</b> <b>Group,</b> {{the development of a}} superior space suit with greater mobility and environmental robustness is necessary to support long-range human space exploration, specifically a mission to Mars. Conceptualized in 1971, a spacesuit utilizing MCP would fulfill these goals but its development was halted due to inadequate mechanical analysis and material limitations at the time. Since then, new active materials have been assessed to potentially further the development of a space qualified MCP space suit, which include quantitative thresholds for minimum pressure production, durability, pressure distribution, mobility range, and ease of garment donning and doffing.

A collision with an active spacecraft may not only lead to the premature termination of the satellite’s mission, but also create additional debris which in turn may collide with other objects. The process wherein debris from collisions becomes the main driver behind {{the creation of new}} debris is known as the ‘Kessler syndrome’ and may already be a reality (Kessler 1991; Inter-Agency <b>Space</b> Debris <b>Coordination</b> Committee—Working <b>Group</b> 2 2013).|$|R
40|$|Advancing {{critical}} and enhancing technologies is considered essential to enabling sustainable and affordable human space exploration. Critical technologies {{are those that}} enable a certain class of mission, such as technologies necessary for safe landing on the Martian surface, advanced propulsion, and closed loop life support. Others enhance the mission by leading to a greater satisfaction of mission objectives or increased probability of mission success. Advanced technologies are needed to reduce mass and cost. Many space agencies have studied exploration mission architectures and scenarios with the resulting lists of {{critical and}} enhancing technologies being very similar. With this in mind, and with the recognition that human space exploration will only be enabled by agencies working together to address these challenges, interested agencies participating in the International <b>Space</b> Exploration <b>Coordination</b> <b>Group</b> (ISECG) have agreed to perform a technology assessment as {{an important step in}} exploring cooperation opportunities for future exploration mission scenarios. "The Global Exploration Strategy: The Framework for Coordination" was developed by fourteen space agencies and released in May 2007. Since the fall of 2008, several International <b>Space</b> Exploration <b>Coordination</b> <b>Group</b> (ISECG) participating <b>space</b> agencies have been studying concepts for human exploration of the moon. They have identified technologies considered critical and enhancing of sustainable space exploration. Technologies such as in-situ resource utilization, advanced power generation/energy storage systems, reliable dust resistant mobility systems, and closed loop life support systems are important examples. Similarly, agencies such as NASA, ESA, and Russia have studied Mars exploration missions and identified critical technologies. They recognize that human and robotic precursor missions to destinations such as LEO, moon, and near earth objects provide opportunities to demonstrate the technologies needed for Mars mission. Agencies see the importance of assessing gaps and overlaps in their plans to advance technologies in order to leverage their investments and enable exciting missions as soon as practical. They see the importance of respecting the ability of any agency to invest in any technologies considered interesting or strategic. This paper will describe the importance of developing an appropriate international strategy for technology development and ideas for effective mechanisms for advancing an international strategy.

40|$|The Schrödinger basin on {{the lunar}} farside is ~ 320 km in {{diameter}} and the best-preserved peak-ring basin of its size in the Earth–Moon system. Spectral and photogeologic analyses of data from the Moon Mineralogy Mapper instrument on the Chandrayaan- 1 spacecraft and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) on the LRO spacecraft indicate the peak ring is composed of anorthositic, noritic, and troctolitic lithologies that were juxtaposed by several cross-cutting faults during peak ring formation. Hydrocode simulations indicate the lithologies were uplifted from depths up to 30 km, representing the crust of the lunar farside. Combining 2 geological and remote-sensing observations with numerical modeling, here we show a Displaced Structural Uplift model is best for peak rings, including that in the K-T Chicxulub impact crater on Earth.

40|$|In {{the context}} of future human space {{exploration}} missions in solar system {{and according to the}} roadmap proposed by ISECG (International <b>Space</b> Exploration <b>Coordination</b> <b>Group),</b> a new step could be to maintain as an outpost, at one of the libration points of the Earth-Moon system, a space station that would ease access to far destinations as Moon, Mars and asteroids and would allow to test some innovative technologies, before employing them for far distant human missions. One of the main challenges will be to maintain permanently and ensure on board crew survival. Then the main problem to solve is to manage the station servitude, during deployment (modules integration) and operational phase. The main challenges of this project lie {{in the design of the}} operational scenarios and, particularly, in trajectories selection, so as to minimize velocity increments (energy consumption) and transportation duration (crew safety). Transfer trajectories have already been deeply studied, since the 1950 s.

40|$|As {{part of the}} Global Exploration Roadmap (GER), the International <b>Space</b> Exploration <b>Coordination</b> <b>Group</b> (ISECG) formed two {{technology}} gap assessment teams to evaluate topic discipline areas {{that had not been}} worked at an international level to date.

Accordingly, the ISECG Technology Working Group (TWG) recommended two discipline areas based on Critical Technology Needs reflected within the GER Technology Development Map (GTDM) : Dust Mitigation and LOX/Methane Propulsion. LOx/Methane propulsion systems are enabling for future human missions Mars by significantly reducing the landed mass of the Mars ascent stage through the use of in-situ propellant production, for improving common fluids for life support, power and propulion thus allowing for diverse redundancy, for eliminating the corrosive and toxic propellants thereby improving surface operations and resusabilty, and for inceasing the performance of propulsion systems. The goals and objectives of the international team are to determine the gaps in technology that must be closed for LOx/Methane to be used in human exploration missions in cis-lunar, lunar, and Mars mission applications. An emphasis is placed on near term lunar lander applications with extensibility to Mars.

The ISECG approved the recommended Gap Assessment teams, and tasked the TWG to formulate the new teams with subject matter experts (SMEs) from the participating agencies. The participating agencies for the Dust Mitigation Gap Assessment Team were ASI, CSA, ESA, JAXA, and NASA.

Space agencies collaborate {{in order to determine}} next steps in this context, through for example, the International <b>Space</b> Exploration <b>Coordination</b> <b>Group</b> (ISECG). Agreement has been reached to identify that human beings will be sent in the upcoming decades to Mars, Moon or asteroids surface. Among all the selected scenarios, locating a deep-space habitat {{in the vicinity of the}} Earth Moon Lagrangian (EML) points has been designated as being a cornerstone of the human space exploration strategy. This paper examines how to design a low cost mission, using the natural dynamics for station integration, crew rotations, cargo delivery and disposal. Moreover, it focuses on the impacts of the station architecture on the global optimization (in term of duration and delta-v) of the trajectories from LEO (Low Earth Orbit) departure to rendezvous in EML and return. Several scenarios have been studied to compare transfer strategies (direct, indirect, lunar flyby, weak stability boundaries) and modeling types (four-body problem, restricted circular three-body problem, ephemeris). Actually, optimization criteria strongly depend on the mission phase. When crew transit is considered, mission duration has mainly to be minimized, while cargo transportation will minimize the global delta-v. The main contribution of this paper lies in the rendezvous dimensioning encompassing both the architectural point of view and the dynamics point of view. This is the first time a study optimizes mission duration and delta-v over all phases of the journey for Human exploration...|$|R

NASA has also included Particulate Contamination Prevention and Mitigation as a cross-cutting technology to be developed for contamination prevention, cleaning and protection. This technology has been highlighted due to the detrimental effect of dust on both human and robotic missions. During manned Apollo missions, dust caused issues with both equipment and crew. Contamination of equipment caused many issues including incorrect instrument readings and increased temperatures due to masking of thermal radiators. The astronauts were directly affected by dust that covered space suits, obscured face shields and later propagated to the cabin and into the crew's eyes and lungs. Robotic missions on Mars were affected when solar panels were obscured by dust thereby reducing the effectiveness of the solar panels. The Electrostatics and Surface Physics Lab in Swamp Works at the Kennedy Space Center has been developing an Electrodynamic Dust Shield (EDS) to remove dust from multiple surfaces, including glass shields and thermal radiators. This technology has been tested in lab environments and has evolved over several years. Tests of the technology include reduced gravity flights (one-sixth g) in which Apollo Lunar dust samples were successfully removed from glass shields while under vacuum (10 (exp - 6) kPa) ...|$|R
40|$|The Global Exploration Roadmap (GER) was {{released}} by the International <b>Space</b> Exploration <b>Coordination</b> <b>Group</b> (ISECG) in September of 2011. It describes mission scenarios that begin with the International Space Station and utilize it to demonstrate necessary technologies and capabilities prior to deployment of systems into Earth-Moon space. Deployment of these systems is an intermediate step in preparation for more complex deep space missions to near-Earth asteroids and eventually Mars. In one of the scenarios described in the GER, "Asteroid Next", there are activities that occur in Earth-Moon space {{at one of the}} Earth-Moon Lagrange (libration) points. In this regard, the authors examine the possible role of an intermediate staging point in an effort to illuminate potential trajectory options for conducting missions in Earth-Moon space of increasing duration, ultimately leading to deep space missions. This paper will describe several options for transits between Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and the libration points, transits between libration points, and transits between the libration points and interplanetary trajectories. The solution space provided will be constrained by selected orbital mechanics design techniques and physical characteristics of hardware to be used in both crewed missions and uncrewed missions. The relationships between time and energy required to transfer hardware between these locations will provide {{a better understanding of the}} potential trade-offs mission planners could consider in the development of capabilities, individual missions, and mission series in the context of the ISECG GER...|$|R
40|$|The {{next step}} for human {{exploration}} {{in the solar}} system could be the deployment of an inhabited station at Earth-Moon Libration points (EML), as a gateway for further destinations such as the Moon (lunar surface settlement), Mars or asteroids, according to International <b>Space</b> Exploration <b>Coordination</b> <b>Group</b> (ISECG) roadmap [1] and several recent publications [5]. In this context, this paper examines how to design a low cost mission, using the natural dynamics for Station integration, crew rotations, cargo delivery and disposal. Preliminary studies lead us to select a Halo orbit around EML 2 to locate the space station. Then, the entire trajectory, from the selection of the departure Low Earth Obit to the rendez-vous strategy in EML 2, was analyzed with several possible transfer types (direct, indirect, lunar flyby or weak stability boundary). Actually, optimization criteria strongly depend on the mission phase. For instance, when crew transit is considered, mission duration has to be minimized, while in the case of cargo transportation, we rather seek to optimize the global delta-v. This paper presents the results (in term of duration and cost) obtained for the two strategies we selected: lunar flybys for the crew and weak stability boundaries trajectories for cargo. We carefully considered the constraints for rendez-vous in EML 2 and evaluated their impact on the performances. Moreover, we assessed the impacts of the model selection (ephemeris, four bodies versus restricted circular three bodies problem [...] .). The main contribution of this project lies in the global optimization of the entire mission from LEO to EML 2 and return with regards to two criteria (mission duration and delta-v), with a focus on the rendez-vous feasibility in EML 2...|$|R

As assembly and testing of the rocket is taking place at numerous sites around the United States, mission planners within NASA and at the agency's international partners continue to evaluate utilization opportunities for this ground-breaking capability. Developed with the goals of safety, affordability, and sustainability in mind, the SLS rocket will launch the Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (MPCV), equipment, supplies, and major science missions for exploration and discovery. NASA is developing this new capability in an austere economic climate, a fact which has inspired the SLS team to find innovative solutions to the challenges of designing, developing, fielding, and operating the largest rocket in history, via a path that will deliver an initial 70 metric ton (t) capability in December 2017 and then continuing through an incremental evolutionary strategy to reach a full capability greater than 130 t.

The session was primarily intended to explore how robotic missions and robotics technologies more generally can help lead to human exploration missions. The session included a wide range of presentations that were roughly grouped into (1) broader background, conceptual, and high-level operations concepts presentations such as the International <b>Space</b> Exploration <b>Coordination</b> <b>Group</b> Roadmap, followed by (2) more detailed narrower presentations such as rover autonomy and communications. The broader presentations helped to provide context and specific technical hooks, and helped lay a foundation for the narrower presentations on more specific challenges and technologies, {{as well as for the}} discussion that followed. The discussion that followed the presentations touched on key questions, themes, actions and potential international collaboration opportunities. Some of the themes that were touched on were (1) multi-agent systems, (2) decentralized command and control, (3) autonomy, (4) low-latency teleoperations, (5) science operations, (6) communications, (7) technology pull vs. technology push, and (8) the roles and challenges of operations in early human architecture and mission concept formulation. A number of potential action items resulted from the workshop session, including: (1) using CCSDS as a further collaboration mechanism for human mission operations, (2) making further contact with subject matter experts, (3) initiating informal collaborative efforts to allow for rapid and efficient implementation, and (4) exploring how SpaceOps can support collaboration and information exchange with human exploration efforts.

A key development objective identified by the International <b>Space</b> Exploration <b>Coordination</b> <b>Group,</b> {{the development of a}} superior space suit with greater mobility and environmental robustness is necessary to support long-range human space exploration, specifically a mission to Mars. Conceptualized in 1971, a spacesuit utilizing MCP would fulfill these goals but its development was halted due to inadequate mechanical analysis and material limitations at the time. Since then, new active materials have been assessed to potentially further the development of a space qualified MCP space suit, which include quantitative thresholds for minimum pressure production, durability, pressure distribution, mobility range, and ease of garment donning and doffing. Guided by these criteria, a SMP biaxial tubular braid applying MCP through active compression was designed and the prototype manufacturing processes were outlined. To predict the pressure production of this garment, the thermo-mechanics of a SMP was combined with the textile mechanics of a biaxial tubular braid and simulated within design parameter ranges consistent with the design criteria and practical considerations. The pressure production was controllable with the design parameters SMP elastic modulus, garment radial deformation, textile fiber spacing, and operational temperature. Assuming reasonable model accuracy, a SMP garment could achieve the necessary pressure production for a space qualified MCP suit, however, the durability of such a garment would be questionable considering the creep sustained from consecutive spacewalks of four to eight hours. Recommendations are made for methods to increase model accuracy, suggested SMP actuation mechanisms, and alternative textile architectures. by Brian Wee. Thesis (S. B.)

Exploration goals and concepts have been gathered by the International <b>Space</b> Exploration <b>Coordination</b> <b>Group</b> (ISECG) at a very high level, representing the overall goals and strategies of each participating space agency. The Global Exploration Roadmap published by ISECG states that international partnerships are part of what drives the mission scenarios. It states "Collaborations will be established at all levels (missions, capabilities, technologies), with various levels of interdependency among the partners. " To make missions with interdependency successful, technologists and system experts need to share information early, before agencies have made concrete plans and binding agreements. This paper provides an overview of possible ways of integrating NASA, ESA, and JAXA work into a conceptual roadmap of life support and environmental monitoring capabilities for future exploration missions. Agencies may have immediate plans as well as long term goals or new ideas that are not part of official policy. But relationships between plans and capabilities may influence the strategies for the best ways to achieve partner goals. Without commitments and an organized program like the International Space Station, requirements for future missions are unclear. Experience from ISS has shown that standards and an early understanding of requirements {{are an important part of}} international partnerships. Attempting to integrate systems that were not designed together can create many problems. Several areas have been identified that could be important to discuss and understand early: units of measure, cabin CO 2 levels, and the definition and description of fluids like high purity oxygen, potable water and residual biocide, and crew urine and urine pretreat.

40|$|The International <b>Space</b> Exploration <b>Coordination</b> <b>Group</b> (ISECG) {{developed}} an integrated Global Exploration Roadmap (GER) that outlines plans for human-assisted sample {{return from the}} lunar surface in ∼ 2024 and for human presence on the lunar surface in ∼ 2028. Previous studies have identified the Schrödinger basin, situated {{on the far side}} of the Moon, as a prime target for lunar science and exploration where a significant number of the scientific concepts reviewed by the National Research Council (NRC, 2007) can be addressed. In this study, two robotic mission traverses within the Schrödinger basin are proposed based on a 3 year mission plan in support of the HERACLES human-assisted sample return mission concept. A comprehensive set of modern remote sensing data (LROC imagery, LOLA topography, M 3 and Clementine spectral data) has been integrated to provide high-resolution coverage of the traverses and to facilitate identification of specific sample localities. We also present a preliminary Concept of Operations (ConOps) study based on a set of notional rover capabilities and instrumental payload. An extended robotic mission to the Schrödinger basin will allow for significant sample return opportunities from multiple distinct geologic terrains and will address multiple high-priority NRC (2007) scientific objectives. Both traverses will offer the first opportunity to (i) sample pyroclastic material from the lunar farside, (ii) sample Schrödinger impact melt and test the lunar cataclysm hypothesis, (iii) sample deep crustal lithologies in an uplifted peak ring and test the lunar magma ocean hypothesis and (iv) explore the top of an impact melt sheet, enhancing our ability to interpret Apollo samples. The shorter traverse will provide the first opportunity to sample farside mare deposits, whereas the longer traverse has significant potential to collect SPA impact melt, which can be used to constrain the basin-forming epoch. These robotic missions will revalidate existing lunar surface capabilities and pioneer new ones and, thus, provide important precursor results for subsequent human missions to the lunar surface...|$|R

40|$|Under {{construction}} today, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Space Launch System (SLS), managed at the Marshall Space Flight Center, {{will provide}} a robust new capability for human and robotic exploration beyond Earth orbit. The vehicle's initial configuration, sched will enable human missions into lunar space and beyond, {{as well as provide}} game-changing benefits for space science missions, including offering substantially reduced transit times for conventionally designed spacecraft. From there, the vehicle will undergo a series of block upgrades via an evolutionary development process designed to expedite mission capture as capability increases. The Space Launch System offers multiple benefits for a variety of utilization areas. From a mass-lift perspective, the initial configuration of the vehicle, capable of delivering 70 metric tons (t) to low Earth orbit (LEO), will be the world's most powerful launch vehicle. Optimized for missions beyond Earth orbit, it will also be the world's only exploration-class launch vehicle capable of delivering 25 t to lunar orbit. The evolved configuration, with a capability of 130 t to LEO, will be the most powerful launch vehicle ever flown. From a volume perspective, SLS will be compatible with the payload envelopes of contemporary launch vehicles, but will also offer options for larger fairings with unprecedented volume-lift capability. The vehicle's mass-lift capability also means that it offers extremely high characteristic energy for missions into deep space. This paper will discuss the impacts that these factors - mass-lift, volume, and characteristic energy - have on a variety of mission classes, particularly human exploration and space science. It will address the vehicle's capability to enable existing architectures for deep-space exploration, such as those documented in the Global Exploration Roadmap, a capabilities-driven outline for future deep-space voyages created by the International <b>Space</b> Exploration <b>Coordination</b> <b>Group,</b> which represents 14 of the world's space agencies. In addition, this paper will detail this new rocket's capability to support missions beyond the human exploration roadmap, including robotic precursor missions to other worlds or uniquely high-mass space operation facilities in Earth orbit. As this paper will explain, the SLS Program is currently building a global infrastructure asset that will provide robust space launch capability to deliver sustainable solutions for exploration...|$|R
40|$|Currently making rapid {{progress}} toward first launch in 2018, NASA's exploration-class Space Launch System (SLS) represents a game-changing new spaceflight capability, enabling mission profiles {{that are currently}} impossible. Designed to launch human deep-space missions farther into space than ever before, the initial configuration of SLS {{will be able to}} deliver more than 70 metric tons of payload to low Earth orbit (LEO), and will send NASA's new Orion crew vehicle into lunar orbit. Plans call for the rocket to evolve on its second flight, via a new upper stage, to a more powerful configuration capable of lofting 105 t to LEO or comanifesting additional systems with Orion on launches to the lunar vicinity. Ultimately, SLS will evolve to a configuration capable of delivering more than 130 t to LEO. SLS is a foundational asset for NASA's Journey to Mars, and has been recognized by the International <b>Space</b> Exploration <b>Coordination</b> <b>Group</b> as a key element for cooperative missions beyond LEO. In order to enable human deep-space exploration, SLS provides unrivaled mass, volume, and departure energy for payloads, offering numerous benefits for a variety of other missions. For robotic science probes to the outer solar system, for example, SLS can cut transit times to less than half that of currently available vehicles, producing earlier data return, enhancing iterative exploration, and reducing mission cost and risk. In the field of astrophysics, SLS' high payload volume, in the form of payload fairings with a diameter of up to 10 meters, creates the opportunity for launch of large-aperture telescopes providing an unprecedented look at our universe, and offers the ability to conduct crewed servicing missions to observatories stationed at locations beyond low Earth orbit. At {{the other end of the}} spectrum, SLS opens access to deep space for low-cost missions in the form of smallsats. The first launch of SLS will deliver beyond LEO 13 6 U smallsat payloads, representing multiple disciplines, including three spacecraft competitively chosen through NASA's Centennial Challenges competition. Private organizations have also identified benefits of SLS for unique public-private partnerships. This paper will give an overview of SLS' capabilities and its current status, and discuss the vehicle's potential for human exploration of deep space and other game-changing utilization opportunities...|$|R
40|$|The International <b>Space</b> Exploration <b>Coordination</b> <b>Group</b> (ISECG) was {{established}} in response to The Global Exploration Strategy (GES) : The Framework for Coordination developed by fourteen space agencies* and released in May 2007. This GES Framework Document recognizes that preparing for human space exploration is a stepwise process, starting with basic knowledge and culminating in a sustained human presence in deep space. ISECG has developed several optional global exploration mission scenarios enabling the phased transition from human operations in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and utilization of the International Space Station (ISS) to human missions beyond LEO leading ultimately to human missions to cis-lunar space, the Moon, Near Earth Asteroids, Mars and its environs. Mission scenarios provide the opportunity for judging various exploration approaches {{in a manner consistent}} with agreed international goals and strategies. Each ISECG notional mission scenario reflects a series of coordinated human and robotic exploration missions over a 25 -year horizon. Mission scenarios are intended to provide insights into next steps for agency investments, following on the success of the ISS. They also provide a framework for advancing the definition of Design Reference Missions (DRMs) and the concepts for capabilities contained within. Each of the human missions contained in the scenarios has been characterized by a DRM which is a top level definition of mission sequence and the capabilities needed to execute that mission. While DRMs are generally destination focused, they will comprise capabilities which are reused or evolved from capabilities used at other destinations. In this way, an evolutionary approach to developing a robust set of capabilities to sustainably explore our solar system is defined. Agencies also recognize that jointly planning for our next steps, building on the accomplishments of ISS, is important to ensuring the robustness and sustainability of any human exploration plan. Developing a shared long-term vision is important, but agencies recognize this is an evolutionary process and requires consideration of many strategic factors. Strategic factors such as the implications of an emerging commercial space industry in LEO, the opportunity provided by extending ISS lifetime to at least 2020, and the importance of defining a plan which is sustainable in light of inevitable domestic policy shifts are timely for agency consideration...|$|R
40|$|Space {{exploration}} {{follows a}} logical set of steps, starting with basic knowledge and culminating, hopefully, in a sustained human presence in space. The next step, {{according to the}} Global Exploration Roadmap, released in September 2011 by the International <b>Space</b> Exploration <b>Coordination</b> <b>Group</b> (ISECG), which reflects the international effort to define feasible and sustainable exploration pathways to the Moon, near-Earth asteroids and Mars, is the Moon as second home in the Solar System. On the basis of risk, cost and technology readiness criteria, the present paper aims to provide quantitative results {{to set up a}} Deep Space- Habitat, as an exploration gateway, at the Earth Moon Lagrange point n° 2 (EML 2), {{on the way to the}} Moon, Mars and asteroids colonization. Highly reliable and safe systems are crucial as interplanetary resupply missions from Earth cannot reach the crew at short notice and a quick return to Earth is not possible. This problem is the strong link with the last year’s article “Mission analysis for a space medical center of an exploration gateway at a lunar libration point”, published at IAC in Cape Town, in 2011. Here a further analysis will be carried out on how to develop the preliminary bibliographical studies and to go deeper into the modeling of scenarios. In a first analysis, a local optimization of the deployment of the Deep-Space Habitat for an international space heaven located at EML 2 is performed. After investigating different propulsion technologies, a general analysis in order to minimize the cost to join the permanent outpost in the Earth-Moon system is run. The future needs an exploration gateway at a lunar libration point which will be developed for a 2035 timeframe, as indicated by the Global Exploration Strategy, might slightly change. As a direct consequence, the number of modules composing the Deep-Space Habitat is not specified to make the analysis more generic and flexible. Secondly, special emphasis is placed on locally optimizing the operational phase, with the mission analysis of the resupply cargo. The time to come back to Earth is the dimensioning parameter in order to guarantee safety in emergency cases for the crew. Finally, a global optimization for the entire Deep-Space Habitat mission, encompassing deployment and operational phase can be started...|$|R
