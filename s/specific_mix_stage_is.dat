40|$|The {{information}} on the interactions between coke and pitch is of great value for the aluminum industry.

In this study, the interaction mechanisms of pitch and coke at the <b>mixing</b> <b>stage</b> <b>were</b> studied by a sessile-drop test using two coal-tar pitches as the liquid and three petroleum cokes as the substrate. The results showed that the coke–pitch interactions are related to both pitch and coke chemical compositions. The contact angle of different coke–pitch systems decreased with increasing time and temperature. At high temperatures, decreasing the pitch viscosity facilitated the spreading of pitch and its penetration into the coke bed. The chemical behavior of petroleum cokes and coal tar pitches were studied using the FT-IR spectroscopy and XPS.

The H 2 O, N 2 and CO 2 -gas mixture is exhaust gas obtained from a hydrocarbon combustion process. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The process for reforming hydrocarbons or hydrocarbon mixtures (educts) in hydrogen and carbon mono-oxide/their product gas, comprises mixing the educt (3) in first <b>mixing</b> <b>stage</b> (3) with oxygen containing gas mixture, mixing the mixture from the first <b>mixing</b> <b>stage</b> (4) with gas mixture containing oxygen, water (H 2 O), nitrogen (N 2) and carbon dioxide (CO 2), in a second <b>mixing</b> <b>stage</b> (4), and reacting the mixture of hydrocarbon oxidation with a catalyst in a reactor (1). The H 2 O, N 2 and CO 2 -gas mixture are exhaust gas obtained from a hydrocarbon combustion process. The exhaust gas mixture contains 10 - 15 vol. % of carbon dioxide, 10 - 13 vol. % of water, 0 - 5 vol. % of oxygen and 73 - 75 vol. % of nitrogen. The exhaust gas mixture is subjected to pre-combustion process before the supply to the hydrocarbon educts. An Ambient air is supplied for the first- and the second <b>mixing</b> <b>stage.</b> A diesel fuel is used as the hydrocarbon educt. The hydrocarbon educt exhibits 40 - 60 degreesC, before the mixing in the first stage. The temperature of the O 2 containing gas mixture is 15 - 25 degreesC and H 2 O, N 2, CO 2 and O 2 containing gas mixture is 400 - 500 degreesC. The hydrocarbon oxidation is carried in the reactor at 850 - 1000 degreesC and at 0 - 10 bar. The ratio between the hydrocarbon educt to the oxygen containing gas mixture is 0. 31 : 0. 41, which {{is defined by the}} air number lambda (= actually supplied oxygen quantity/oxygen quantity required for the total oxidation). The ratio of the hydrocarbon educt to the H 2 O, N 2, CO 2 and O 2 containing gas mixture is 0. 25 : 0. 5, which is defined by a S/C (steam to carbon) ratio (= amount of material at water vapor in supplied gas mixture/amount of material at carbon atoms in the fuel educt). The ratio of S:C for both <b>mixing</b> <b>stages</b> <b>is</b> 0. 2 - 0. 5. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a reactor for conversion of hydrocarbon educt. USE - For reforming fuels in motor vehicles. ADVANTAGE - The hydrocarbon fuel reforming is more economical and simple and avoids high water consumption and the danger of the soot formation by avoiding partial oxidation of the fuels...|$|R

Sinusoids cannot be used per se for high-quality audio modeling {{because they do not}} represent all the audible information of a recording.

Generally, the encoding process needs much higher bitrates for the noise part than the sinusoidal one. Our objective is to encode spot microphone signals using the SNM, by taking advantage of the interchannel similarities to achieve low bitrates. We demonstrate that for a given multichannel audio recording, the noise part for each spot microphone signal (before the <b>mixing</b> <b>stage)</b> can <b>be</b> obtained by using its noise envelope to transform the noise part of just one of the signals (the so-called ”reference signal”, which is fully encoded). 1...|$|R

40|$|An {{idealized}} diffusion–evaporation {{model of}} time-dependent mixing between a cloud volume and a droplet-free volume is analyzed. The initial droplet size distribution (DSD) {{in the cloud}} volume {{is assumed to be}} monodisperse. It is shown that evolution of the microphysical variables and the final equilibrium state are unambiguously determined by two non-dimensional parameters. The first one is the potential evaporation parameter R, proportional to the ratio of the saturation deficit to the liquid water content in the cloud volume, that determines whether the equilibrium state is reached at 100  % relative humidity, or is characterized by a complete evaporation of cloud droplets. The second parameter Da is the Damkölher number equal to the ratio of the characteristic mixing time to the phase relaxation time. Parameters R and Da determine the type of mixing. The results are analyzed within a wide range of values of R and Da. It is shown that there is no pure homogeneous mixing, since the first <b>mixing</b> <b>stage</b> <b>is</b> always inhomogeneous. The mixing type can change during the mixing process. Any mixing type leads to formation of a tail of small droplets in DSD and, therefore, to DSD broadening that depends on Da. At large Da, the final DSD dispersion can be as large as 0. 2. The total duration of mixing varies from several to 100 phase relaxation time periods, depending on R and Da. The definitions of homogeneous and inhomogeneous types of mixing are reconsidered and clarified, enabling a more precise delimitation between them. The paper also compares the results obtained with those based on the classic mixing concepts. ...|$|R

40|$|Recent collision-finding {{attacks against}} hash {{functions}} such as MD 5 and SHA- 1 motivate the use of provably collision-resistant (CR) functions in their place. Finding a collision in a provably CR function implies the ability to solve some hard problem (e. g., factoring). Unfortunately, existing provably CR functions make poor replacements for hash functions as they fail to deliver behaviors demanded by practical use. In particular, they are easily distinguished from a random oracle. We initiate an investigation into building hash functions from provably CR functions. As a method for achieving this, we present the Mix-Compress-Mix (MCM) construction; it envelopes any provably CR function H (with suitable regularity properties) between two injective “mixing ” stages. The MCM construction simultaneously enjoys (1) provable collision-resistance in the standard model, and (2) indifferentiability from a monolithic random oracle when the <b>mixing</b> <b>stages</b> themselves <b>are</b> indifferentiable from a random oracle that observes injectivity.

Frequency multiplication, division, and <b>mixing</b> <b>stages</b> <b>are</b> then implemented to generate the exact output atomic resonance frequencies. Absolute phase noise performances of the output 4. 596 GHz signal are measured to be − 109 and − 141 dB rad 2 /Hz at 100 Hz and 10 kHz Fourier frequencies, respectively. The phase noise of the 6. 834 GHz signal is − 105 and − 138 dB rad 2 /Hz at 100 Hz and 10 kHz offset frequencies, respectively. The performances of the synthesis chains contribute to the atomic clock short term fractional frequency stability at a level of 3. 1 × 10 − 14 for the Cs cell clock and 2 × 10 − 14 for the Rb clock at 1 s averaging time. This value is comparable with the clock shot noise limit. We describe the residual phase noise measurements of key components and stages to identify the main limitations of the synthesis chains. The residual frequency stability of synthesis chains is measured to be at the 10 − 15 level for 1 s integration time.

We discussed the potentials of some stage-specific genes, such as sorbitol dehydrogenase, cysteine protease, venom allergen-like protein, and FMRFamide-like peptide, as diagnosis markers and novel control targets...|$|R

The objectives were to evaluate the potential use of the mixograph and farinograph to study DMF mixing and hydration properties and also to evaluate the use of the Rapid Visco Analyzer (RVA), consistometer and penetrometer to study DMF properties. The effect of sample size, moisture level, mixing speed, temperature, particle size distribution and CMC level on the mixing characteristics of DMF were evaluated. Reformulated and commercial flours with and without CMC were also evaluated using a consistometer, penetrometer, RVA and also were subjectively evaluated for their machinability properties. Reduced moisture levels produced firmer masas which produced higher and wider curves. At increased moisture levels masa develops maximum consistency and stickiness faster. Excess water produced soft masas that exhibited decreased maximum consistency. Three <b>stages</b> <b>were</b> observed during <b>mixing.</b> The first <b>stage</b> involves hydration of the DMF causing the curve to go up. During the second stage, masa develops cohesiveness; the curve becomes wider and reaches maximum consistency. During the third stage, masa becomes sticky due to overmixing and the curve becomes narrower and lower. <b>Mixing</b> <b>stages</b> <b>were</b> developed at different times reflecting differences among DMF. Finer DMF required less mixing time to reach maximum consistency and to develop stickiness, whereas coarser flours produced firmer masas with increased maximum consistency. Masas from DMF containing 0. 5 % CMC exhibited the highest maximum consistency, while time to reach maximum consistency increased along with CMC level. Reduced penetrometer readings and shorter distances traveled in the consistometer, as well as increased viscosities in the RVA were significantly correlated to increased maximum consistency in the mixograph and farinograph. Subjective machinability determinations were also significantly correlated to mixograph and farinograph parameters. The mixograph and farinograph are simple techniques with acceptable repeatability to detect differences in mixing characteristics of DMF. Mixograph and farinograph as well as consistometer, penetrometer and RVA have potential for rapid evaluation of DMF properties and mixing performance in a quality control program...|$|R
40|$|Supernumerary {{teeth are}} {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most significant dental anomalies during the primary and early <b>mixed</b> dentition <b>stages.</b> They <b>are</b> of great concern to the dentists and parents because of the eruption, occlusal, and esthetic problems they can cause. Supernumerary teeth occur more frequently in the permanent dentition but rarely in primary dentition. Mesiodens is the most common type of supernumerary teeth but rarely seen in lower arch. Early recognition and diagnosis of supernumerary teeth is important to prevent further complications in permanent dentition. Four cases of supernumerary teeth with mesiodens in upper and lower arch in primary dentition and their management have been discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Bassist Jeff Ament plays upright bass on [...] "Glorified G". Guitarist Stone Gossard on the song:"Glorified G" [...] was {{one that}} went {{through a series of}} changes, and barely held {{together}} the whole time. We all knew there were melodies and riffs in it we liked. But even listening to the song right up to the <b>mixing</b> <b>stage</b> I <b>was</b> going, [...] "Does this work at all?!" [...] Here was Mike playing a very up, country guitar line while I'm playing this choppy down riff on {{the opposite end of the}} groove spectrum. Meanwhile, Jeff's got this totally other bass line going that's not really steady, and he's going off in a melodic direction, too. So there's not really anybody holding it down, and Dave's got to decide either to play it more the country way or play it the funky way. There was this precarious balance, and then suddenly the bridge comes in from out of the blue, which, if Eddie doesn't sing it just right, sounds sort of foreign. Finally, it never goes back to the chorus at the end, it turns into something else.|$|R
