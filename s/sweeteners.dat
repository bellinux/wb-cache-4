5|$|Fruit {{was popular}} {{and could be}} served fresh, dried, or preserved, and was a common {{ingredient}} in many cooked dishes. Since sugar and honey were both expensive, it was common to include many types of fruit in dishes that called for <b>sweeteners</b> of some sort. The fruits of choice in the south were lemons, citrons, bitter oranges (the sweet type was not introduced until several hundred years later), pomegranates, quinces, and, of course, grapes. Farther north, apples, pears, plums, and strawberries were more common. Figs and dates were eaten all over Europe, but remained rather expensive imports in the north.|$|E

40|$|Low-calorie <b>sweetener</b> use {{for weight}} control {{has come under}} {{increasing}} scrutiny as obesity, especially abdominal obesity, remain entrenched despite substantial low-calorie <b>sweetener</b> use. We evaluated whether chronic low-calorie <b>sweetener</b> use is {{a risk factor for}} abdominal obesity. We used 8268 anthropometric measurements and 3096 food diary records with detailed information on low-calorie <b>sweetener</b> consumption in all food products, from 1454 participants (741 men, 713 women) in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging collected from 1984 to 2012 with median follow-up of 10 years (range: 0 - 28 years). At baseline, 785 were low-calorie <b>sweetener</b> non-users (51. 7 % men) and 669 participants were low-calorie <b>sweetener</b> users (50. 1 % men). Time-varying low-calorie <b>sweetener</b> use was operationalized as the proportion of visits since baseline at which low-calorie <b>sweetener</b> use was reported. We used marginal structural models to determine the association between baseline and time-varying low-calorie <b>sweetener</b> use with longitudinal outcomes-body mass index, waist circumference, obesity and abdominal obesity-with outcome status assessed at the visit following low-calorie <b>sweetener</b> ascertainment to minimize the potential for reverse causality. All models were adjusted for year of visit, age, sex, age by sex interaction, race, current smoking status, dietary intake (caffeine, fructose, protein, carbohydrate, and fat), physical activity, diabetes status, and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension score as confounders. With median follow-up of 10 years, low-calorie <b>sweetener</b> users had 0. 80 kg/m 2 higher body mass index (95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 17 - 1. 44), 2. 6 cm larger waist circumference (95 % CI, 0. 71 - 4. 39), 36. 7 % higher prevalence (prevalence ratio = 1. 37; 95 % CI, 1. 10 - 1. 69) and 53 % higher incidence (hazard ratio = 1. 53; 95 % CI 1. 10 - 2. 12) of abdominal obesity than low-calorie <b>sweetener</b> non-users. Low-calorie <b>sweetener</b> use is independently associated with heavier relative weight, a larger waist, and a higher prevalence and incidence of abdominal obesity suggesting that low-calorie <b>sweetener</b> use may not be an effective means of weight control...|$|R
50|$|Thaumatin is a low-calorie <b>sweetener</b> and flavour modifier. The {{protein is}} often used {{primarily}} for its flavour-modifying properties and not exclusively as a <b>sweetener.</b>|$|R
25|$|A 2013 review {{found that}} there is {{insufficient}} {{evidence to suggest that}} replacing dietary sugar with non-caloric <b>sweeteners</b> alone is beneficial for energy balance, weight loss, or diabetes risk factors. The review found that restricting calories is more important than avoidance of sugar for weight management. However, the review concluded that replacing dietary sugar with non-caloric <b>sweeteners</b> is useful for managing blood sugar in diabetes patients. The review recommends that all <b>sweeteners</b> be consumed in moderation.|$|E
25|$|A 2015 review {{found that}} there is no {{evidence}} that non-caloric <b>sweeteners</b> cause metabolic disorders in humans.|$|E

25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that gum flavor is {{perceived}} better {{in the presence of}} <b>sweetener.</b> Companies have started to create chemical systems in gum so that the <b>sweetener</b> and flavor release together in a controlled manner during chewing.|$|R
25|$|A cooling {{sensation}} {{is achieved}} through the chemical {{phenomenon of the}} negative enthalpy of dissolution that occurs with bulk <b>sweeteners,</b> such as the sugar alcohols. The enthalpy of dissolution refers to the overall amount of heat that is absorbed or released in the dissolving process. Because the bulk <b>sweeteners</b> absorb heat as they dissolve and have a negative enthalpy, they yield a cooling sensation as they are dissolved in a consumer’s saliva.|$|E

50|$|In the mid-1980s, stevia {{became popular}} in U.S. natural foods and health food industries, as a noncaloric natural <b>sweetener</b> for teas and weight-loss blends. The {{makers of the}} {{synthetic}} <b>sweetener</b> NutraSweet (at the time Monsanto) asked the FDA to require testing of the herb. In 2007, the Coca-Cola Company announced plans to obtain approval for its stevia-derived <b>sweetener,</b> Rebiana, {{for use as a}} food additive within the United States by 2009, as well as plans to market Rebiana-sweetened products in 12 countries that allow stevia's use as a food additive. In May 2008, Coca Cola and Cargill announced the availability of Truvia, a consumer brand stevia <b>sweetener</b> containing erythritol and Rebiana, which the FDA permitted as a food additive in December 2008. Coca-Cola announced intentions to release stevia-sweetened beverages in late December 2008.

5000|$|Truvia (marketed and stylized as truvía) is a stevia-based sugar {{substitute}} developed jointly by The Coca-Cola Company and Cargill. It is distributed and marketed by Cargill as a tabletop <b>sweetener</b> {{as well as}} a food ingredient. Truvia is made of rebiana, erythritol, and natural flavors. Because it comes from the stevia plant, Cargill classifies it as a natural <b>sweetener</b> {{in addition to being a}} non-nutritive <b>sweetener,</b> although Cargill has settled lawsuits alleging deceptive marketing of Truvia as [...] "natural". Since its launch in 2008, Truvia natural <b>sweetener</b> has become the second best-selling {{sugar substitute}} in units in the U.S. behind Splenda, surpassing Equal and Sweet'n Low. Truvia competes with Stevia In The Raw, the #2 brand of stevia and with PepsiCo's PureVia, the #3 brand of stevia.|$|R
