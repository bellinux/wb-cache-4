5|$|Grand Forks has {{an active}} sister city program {{designed}} to encourage cultural and economic exchanges. Grand Forks' first sister city was Ishim in the Soviet Union. The relationship with the Siberian city formally began in 1984 during the Cold War. Sometime in the late 1990s, however, political and economic turmoil in Russia ended the relationship. While the relationship with Ishim faded, Grand Forks found a new sister in Awano, Japan. An informal relationship began in 1994 when the school districts of both cities began exchanging students. In 1998, the two formally proclaimed themselves sister cities. The most concrete evidence {{of the relationship between}} the two is a Japanese rock garden in Grand Forks' Sertoma Park and a sculpture of an American bison in an Awano park. However, the annexation of Awano by the larger city of Kanuma has led to the end of the sister city relationship. Grand Forks' relationship with Dickinson, North Dakota, began in 2002, when delegations from each city visited the other. Grand Forks Mayor Michael Brown has <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> having friends in western North Dakota, which typically has diverging interests from eastern cities, could help at the state legislature. Sarpsborg, Norway, became a sister city in 2005 following several exchanges among leaders from both cities. The city became interested in building a relationship with Sarpsborg because many Grand Forks residents have Norwegian heritage.|$|E

It was also the first time since 1950 that an incumbent congressman lost a primary in Tennessee's 1st congressional district. Davis <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> Democratic voters, knowing they had no realistic chance of defeating him in November, contributed to his Republican 1st District primary loss, and he believes he was the winner among voters who identify as Republicans. Tennessee has an open primary system.|$|E
25|$|Obama and Zapatero met {{face-to-face}} for {{the first}} time on April 2, 2009, at the G20 London Summit. Both leaders participated in the NATO Summit in Strasbourg-Kehl, where Spain committed an additional 450 troops to its previous military contingent of 778 in Afghanistan. Commentators said the decision may have been partially motivated by the Zapatero government's desire to curry favor with the new administration in Washington. Days later at the EU-U.S. Summit in Prague the two held a 45-minute meeting, and afterwards shared a photo-op for the press, where Obama called Zapatero a friend, and <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> that the two nations would establish an even stronger relationship in the years to come. This was the first formal meeting between heads of government of Spain and the United States since 2004.|$|E

25|$|Scorsese often casts {{the same}} actors in his films, {{particularly}} Robert De Niro, who collaborated with Scorsese for eight feature films and one short film. Included {{are the three}} films (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, and Goodfellas) that made AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies list. Scorsese has often <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> De Niro's best work under his direction was Rupert Pupkin in The King of Comedy. After {{the turn of the}} century, Scorsese found a new muse with younger actor Leonardo DiCaprio, collaborating for five feature films to date, along with one short. Several critics have compared Scorsese's new partnership with DiCaprio with his previous one with De Niro. Frequent collaborators also include Victor Argo (6), Harry Northup (6), Harvey Keitel (5), Murray Moston (5), J. C. MacKenzie (3), Joe Pesci (3), Frank Vincent (3) and Verna Bloom (3). Others who have appeared in multiple Scorsese films include Daniel Day-Lewis, who had become very reclusive to the Hollywood scene, Alec Baldwin, Ben Kingsley, Jude Law, Emily Mortimer, John C. Reilly, Frank Sivero, Ray Winstone and Nick Nolte. Before their deaths, Scorsese's parents, Charles Scorsese and Catherine Scorsese, appeared in bit parts, walk-ons or supporting roles, most notably in Goodfellas.|$|E
500|$|David Mirkin {{attempted}} to put [...] "as much blood and guts" [...] into the episode as he could. This was because Mirkin was disappointed by complaints from Congress regarding {{the amount of}} violence in the show and their attempts for it to be censored. He later called it [...] "the most [...] disturbing Halloween show ever". The opening sequence, in which Marge states the episode could not be shown and plays some live action stock footage, was also in reaction to this. Mirkin <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> Halloween shows can be [...] "scary as well as fun".|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast, [...] "Radio Bart" [...] finished 31st {{in the ratings}} for the week of January 6–12, 1992, with a Nielsen rating of 14.1, equivalent to approximately 13 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week. The episode {{was nominated for a}} Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program, but lost to Will Vinton's A Claymation Easter on CBS. [...] "Radio Bart" [...] was submitted for consideration because it was the staff's favorite episode of the season. Executive producer Al Jean said they thought this episode or an episode of The Ren & Stimpy Show would win and they were [...] "absolutely floored" [...] when neither did. The Simpsons director David Silverman <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> The Simpsons and Ren & Stimpy split the vote, allowing A Claymation Easter to win the Emmy.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers of {{the episode}} have also praised it for its {{character}} development. Todd Gilchrist of IGN <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> the key to The Simpsons longevity is its [...] "sentimental but not gooey" [...] approach to storytelling and character development. He cited [...] "Lisa the Vegetarian" [...] as an example and said: [...] "Lisa sabotages Homer's barbecue, which results in an unceremonious death for his prize pig. But rather than simply punctuating the episode with an iconic image of the porker soaring through the air, the writers actually develop a story into which the joke fits. The comedic effect is actually intensified because we care about the characters, are invested in the story, and primed for a great gag." [...] The Niagara Gazettes Phil Dzikiy said that [...] "the character development and storytelling is perfect", noting that the episode was [...] "equally hilarious, touching and satirical".|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} form the father-daughter bond needed for their {{respective}} roles, both Novakovic and Winton introduced each other to their families. The actors {{spent a lot of}} time together, to ensure they were comfortable together on and off screen. Natasha's father, Michael, is a widower and she is his only child. Bower revealed Natasha has her father wrapped around her finger. Michael dotes upon Natasha and Bower opined Natasha causes havoc because he is not strict with her. Winton <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> Michael is not handling things with Natasha [...] "too poorly", but she does make things difficult for him. During a 2011 interview with Channel 5, Winton said that Michael and Natasha's relationship had become tortured. Winton stated that Michael wishes Natasha would stop lying to him and hoped she would get her act together, so they could have some semblance of a father/daughter relationship. Winton wanted Michael to build a better relationship with Natasha in the future as he loves her, despite the things she has done.|$|E
500|$|The writers {{originally}} wanted American actor Sheldon Leonard {{to voice}} Fat Tony, {{but they were}} unable to get him, so they went with Joe Mantegna instead. Mantegna was offered the role during the show's second season, and since he had seen the show before and thought it was [...] "funny", he decided to give it a shot. He felt honored that they asked him to do a voice for the show. In an interview with The A.V. Club, Mantegna <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> the reason he got the role was partly due to his performance in the 1990 Mafia film The Godfather Part III, which opened just prior to when he received the role. He thought the script was smart and clever and that he enjoyed recording it. Mantegna has since appeared many times on the show as Fat Tony, who became a recurring character; it is Mantegna's longest-running role in his acting career. Mantegna commented: [...] "Who knew that Fat Tony was gonna resonate in {{the hearts and minds of}} the [...] out there? Apparently [...] got enough feedback as to how the character was liked that they wrote it in again and again, and I was kind of a recurring guy that they’d tap into at least a couple episodes a season." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although his half-sister, Candace Gingrich, is {{a lesbian}} LGBT rights advocate, Gingrich opposes gay {{marriage}}. Speaking in Iowa in 2011, Gingrich <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> marriage is {{between a man}} and a woman, and told reporters that he [...] "would like to find ways to defend that view as legitimately and effectively as possible". He said that the U.S. government should be defending the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). His 2012 campaign web site says that he would [...] "nominate conservative judges who are committed to upholding Constitutional limited government and understand that the role of the judges is to interpret the law, not legislate from the bench". Gingrich believes the Republican Party should accept the reality that several states allow same-sex marriage and accept the distinction between [...] "a marriage in a church" [...] and [...] "a legal document issued by the state".|$|E
2500|$|Steele {{is opposed}} to {{abortion}} and <b>said</b> <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> Roe v. Wade was [...] "wrongly decided" [...] and [...] "should be overturned." [...] Steele was endorsed by the National Right to Life Committee during his run for Senate in 2006. In a March 2009 interview with GQ, Steele suggested that abortion restrictions {{should be left to}} state governments, and stated that he [...] "absolutely" [...] believes there is room for a [...] "pro-choice" [...] candidate in the GOP. This statement prompted criticism from socially conservative Republicans such as Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, as well as the Christian Coalition, and Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council [...] In response to these critics, Steele suggested that he asked God for patience [...] "so I absolutely don't go out and kick this person's ass.'" ...|$|E

Pawlenty believes that state governments should outlaw abortion, except for cases of rape, incest, and to save a woman's life. [...] He thinks the United States Supreme Court decided Roe v. Wade wrongly, abortion being a state, not a federal, matter. He opposes same-sex marriage and civil unions, and said on talk radio [...] "...

60|$|Mr. Petrie being asked, Whether he was {{informed}} by the Rajah, or by others, at Tanjore or Madras, that Mr. Benfield, whilst he managed the revenues at Tanjore, during the usurpation of the Nabob, did not treat the inhabitants with great rigor? he said, He did hear from the Rajah that Mr. Benfield did treat the inhabitants with rigor during {{the time he had}} anything to do with the administration of the revenues of Tanjore.--Being asked, If he recollects in what particulars? he said, The Rajah particularly complained that grain had been delivered out to the inhabitants, for the purposes of cultivation, at a higher price than the market price of grain in the country; he cannot say the actual difference of price, but it struck him at the time as something very considerable.--Being asked, Whether that money was all recovered from the inhabitants? he said, The Rajah of Tanjore told him that the money was all recovered from the inhabitants.--Being asked, Whether he did not hear that the Nabob exacted from the country of Tanjore, whilst he was in possession of it? he said, From the accounts which he received at Tanjore of the revenues for a number of years past, it appeared that the Nabob collected from the country, while he was in possession, rather more than sixteen lacs of pagodas annually; whereas, when he was at Tanjore, it did not yield more than nine lacs.--Being asked, From whence that difference arose? he said, When Tanjore was conquered for the Nabob, he has been told that many thousand of the native inhabitants fled from the country, some into the country of Mysore, and others into the dominions of the Mahrattas; he understood from the same authority, that, while the Nabob was in possession of the country, many inhabitants from the Carnatic, allured by the superior fertility and opulence of Tanjore, and encouraged by the Nabob, took up their residence there, which enabled the Nabob to cultivate the whole country; and upon the restoration of the Rajah, he has heard that the Carnatic inhabitants were carried back to their own country, which left a considerable blank in the population, which was not replaced while he was there, principally owing to an opinion which prevailed through the country that the Rajah's government was not to be permanent, but that another revolution was fast approaching. During the Nabob's government, the price of grain was considerably higher (owing to a very unusual scarcity in the Carnatic) than when he was in Tanjore.--Being asked, Whether he was ever in the Marawar country? he said, Yes; he was commissary to the army in that expedition.--Being asked, Whether that country was much wasted by the war? he said, Plunder was not permitted to the army, nor did the country suffer from its operations, except in causing many thousands of the inhabitants, who had been employed in the cultivation of the country, to leave it.--Being asked, Whether he knows what is done with the palace and inhabitants of Ramnaut? he said, The town was taken by storm, but not plundered by the troops; it was immediately delivered up to the Nabob's eldest son.--Being asked, Whether great riches were not supposed to be in that palace and temple? he said, It was universally believed so.--Being asked, What account was given of them? he said, He cannot tell; everything remained in the possession of the Nabob.--Being asked, What became of the children and women of the family of the prince of that country? he said, The Rajah was a minor; the government was in the hands of the Ranny, his mother: from general report he has heard they were carried to Trichinopoly, and placed in confinement there.--Being asked, Whether he perceived any difference in the face of the Carnatic when he first knew it and when he last knew it? he <b>said,</b> <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> he did, particularly in its population.--Being asked, Whether it was better or worse? he said, It was not so populous.--Being asked, What is the condition of the Nabob's eldest son? he said, He was in the Black Town of Madras, when he left the country.--Being asked, Whether he was entertained there in a manner suitable to his birth and expectations? he said, No: he lived there without any of those exterior marks of splendor which princes of his rank in India are particularly fond of.--Being asked, Whether he has not heard that his appointments were poor and mean? he said, He has heard that they were not equal to his rank and expectations.--Being asked, Whether he had any share in the government? he said, He believes none: for some years past the Nabob has delegated most of the powers of government to his second son.--Being asked, Whether the Rajah did not complain to him of the behavior of Mr. Benfield to himself personally; and what were the particulars? he said, He did so, and related to him the following particulars. About fifteen days after Lord Pigot's confinement, Mr. Benfield came to Tanjore, and delivered the Rajah two letters from the then Governor, Mr. Stratton,--one public, and the other private. He demanded an immediate account of the presents which had been made to Lord Pigot, payment of the tunkahs which he (Mr. Benfield) had received from the Nabob upon the country, and that the Rajah should only write such letters to the Madras government as Mr. Benfield should approve and give to him. The Rajah answered, that he did not acknowledge the validity of any demands made by the Nabob upon the country; that those tunkahs related to accounts which he (the Rajah) had no concern with; that he never had given Lord Pigot any presents, but Lord Pigot had given him many; and that as to his correspondence with the Madras government, he would not trouble Mr. Benfield, because he would write his letters himself. That the Rajah told the witness, that by reason of this answer he was much threatened, in consequence of which he desired Colonel Harper, who then commanded at Tanjore, to be present at his next interview with Mr. Benfield; when Mr. Benfield denied many parts of the preceding conversation, and threw the blame upon his interpreter, Comroo. When Mr. Benfield found (as the Rajah informed him) that he could not carry these points which had brought him to Tanjore, he prepared to set off for Madras; that the Rajah sent him a letter which he had drawn out in answer to one which Mr. Benfield had brought him; that Mr. Benfield disapproved of the answer, and returned it by Comroo to the durbar, who did not deliver it into the Rajah's hands, but threw it upon the ground, and expressed himself improperly to him.|$|E
