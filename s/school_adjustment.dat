25|$|Agreeableness is of {{fundamental}} importance to psychological well-being, predicting mental health, positive affect, and {{good relations with}} others. In both childhood and adolescence agreeableness has been tied to externalizing issues. Along with this {{it has also been}} implicated in outcomes to conflict management skills, <b>school</b> <b>adjustment,</b> peer-social status and self-esteem. Some work has been done looking into whether agreeableness levels through childhood have effects on adjustment and agreeableness into adulthood. Among young adults, individuals that have been diagnosed with either externalizing as well as internalizing disorders present lower levels of agreeableness and communion, and higher levels of negative emotionality, than those young adults without such disorders. Agreeableness also is reported to mediate links between anger and depression in young adults. Among college students, agreeableness is often associated with self-reports of emotional experience and control along with psycho-physiological responses to affectively charged stimuli. Across adulthood, low agreeableness {{has been found to be}} a health risk. High agreeableness, especially trust and honesty, has been linked to longevity.|$|E

Coplan claims that Western children with inhibition problems may be at a higher risk of developmental problems in school. Although social inhibition may be a predictor of social and <b>school</b> <b>adjustment</b> problems in children, Chen argues that the effect of social inhibition on <b>school</b> <b>adjustment</b> differs between Western cultures and Chinese culture. Chen found that in Chinese children, behavioral inhibition was associated with greater peer liking, social interaction, positive school attitudes, and school competence and fewer later learning problems, which is also different from western cultures. [...] In other studies, researchers such as Oysterman found there to be difficulties in adjustment in children that were experiencing inhibition. In Western cultures, these difficulties are seen more because of the emphasis on social assertiveness and self-expression as traits that are valued in development. In other cultures children are sometimes expected to be inhibited. This does not contrast other cultures in which other cultures were children are socialized and assert themselves. Despite these differences there are also similarities between gender. Boys were more antagonistic in peer interaction and seemed to have more learning problems in school. Girls were more cooperative in peer interaction and had a more positive outlook on school. They formed more affiliations with peers, and performed more completely in school.|$|E

This paper also pays special attention to the heterogeneity, robustness, and long-run persistence of effects. Results show that orphans are on average 10 pp less likely to attend school than their nonorphaned counterparts, this effect being even more pronounced for girls and young children from poorer households.

Using a dataset of 43, 465 male and female 8 th grade students from 349 schools across the contiguous United States who participated in a national study of substance use in rural communities between 1996 and 2000, multilevel latent covariate models were utilized to disentangle the individual-level and contextual effects of three <b>school</b> <b>adjustment</b> variables (i. e., school bonding, behavior at school, and friend’s school bonding) on alcohol use. All three <b>school</b> <b>adjustment</b> factors were significant predictors of alcohol use both within and between schools. Furthermore, this study demonstrated a strong contextual effect: Students who attended schools where the overall level of <b>school</b> <b>adjustment</b> was higher reported lower levels of alcohol use even after taking their own <b>school</b> <b>adjustment</b> into account. The results demonstrate the importance of both a student’s own level of <b>school</b> <b>adjustment</b> and the normative level of <b>school</b> <b>adjustment</b> among students in the school on an adolescent’s use of alcohol.
