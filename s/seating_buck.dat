5000|$|Approval Day:“Ours {{was quite}} unique {{and it took}} the whole ball game" [...] said Oros. [...] "It was a {{unanimous}} decision to accept the car we had prepared. They approved everything on our car — no criticisms.” Henry II was totally sold on the Oros team design, and Iacocca was just happy he was ﬁnally {{going to have a}} car. “I was not in the courtyard at the approval moment, nor was any other chief of a studio there,” noted Oros. Henry Ford II walked over later and told Oros, [...] "Joe, you know we’ve approved your car but you’re $15 over the hill on it.” Oros said he understood and would ﬁnd a way to get the money back out of it. The product planners had an established budget and sales band on each car. So the Mustang estimated production cost had to be met or it wouldn’t be profitable.Henry II then wandered over to the <b>seating</b> <b>buck,</b> a mockup of the Mustang interior, and tried out the rear seat. “He was a big man sitting in the rear seat,” said Oros. “He said, ‘Joe, I believe that we need a little more headroom.’ He swung back and hit his head. “I said, ‘Yes, sir, we can do that.’ And he said, ‘Can you do that without losing the design?’ and I said, ‘Yes, sir, we’ll do that,’ and that was it. It worked.” You didn’t want to say no to the guy with his name on the building, according to Oros.|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{developing}} 1) iso-perception maps for various groups of drivers in terms of age, gender, and anthropometry and 2) the experiment framework required for obtaining subjective and objective measures. A total of 9 maps, which describe drivers' perceptions regarding their static behaviors inside a typical mid-size sedan, {{can be used to}} improve the utilization of the limited driver workspace, and to select better design alternatives for occupant packaging. An adjustable <b>seating</b> <b>buck,</b> a ***-camera motion capture system (Vicon), and a **-channel EMG system were used for the experiment. Each iso-perception map was developed while H-PT, steering wheel center, or TGS knob center was moved to each of pre-defined positions relative to driver-selected positions. Adjustable ranges or positions of the seat, steering wheel, and TGS lever described in iso-perception maps can be used to determine better package layout alternatives. clos...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is tn {{investigate}} the effect of lumbar support prominence on comfort and body pressure distribution of an automobile seat to determine the most favorable lumbar support prominence level during short-term driving. Fifteen male drivers drove the automobile on road for a distance of 3 km at 3 different levels of lumbar support prominence: 10 mm, 30 mm and 50 mm The body pressure distributions were recorded, and subjective ratings on the whole body comfoti and the discomfort at 10 body regions were evaluated as well. For subjective ratings on comfort and body pressure distribution, 1 Onnn of lumbar support prominence was found to be most favorable in short-tam driving. The ratios of body pressure variables varied among three measurement points of time: before driving, middle of driving and after driving. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to measure the body pressure distribution on the static <b>seating</b> <b>buck</b> or on the simulator in order to investigate the driver’s comfor...|$|E

40|$|International audienceVirtual Reality {{techniques}} {{are more and}} more used to validate the design hypotheses during different phases of the product development. In the automotive field, however, there are some types of analyses that are unlikely to be performed by using only a Virtual Prototype (VP) of the vehicle. Therefore, the trend is to develop systems -called seating bucks- that enable engineers to integrate virtual and real objects to provide a tangible interface for the VP of the vehicle. This research aims at defining a new system and an evaluation protocol to improve, simplify and speed up the usual activities carried out for the ergonomic assessment of the driver’s seat. In particular, we are interested in evaluating the ergonomics of car’s dashboard with its knobs, buttons, display and other control systems. In this paper, we have described the development of this system by providing useful information about the physical issues, related to the <b>seating</b> <b>buck</b> structure, and about the development of the MR environment. The system and the evaluation protocol have been validated by performing several testing sessions with users. The tests confirm the effectiveness of our approach and have enabled us to achieve at interesting considerations...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{suggested a}} method of analyzing how the driver's anthropometric data would best be accommodated by a specific driver-vehicle interface. Three-dimensional manikins with 18 links were developed using US 95 th percentile male and 5 th percentile female's anthropometric data. In addition, an adjustable <b>seating</b> <b>buck</b> was constructed to control seven package variables. The levels of each package variables were determined according to the interior dimensions of mid-size passenger vehicles. After the manikins were situated on each derivable driving environment of the seating buck's package variable levels, 3 -D cartesian coordinate values were collected from the manikin's articular points by using a coordinate measuring machine. The data were then converted into joint angles of manikins for suggesting suitable driving environments by considering appropriate driving postures. INTRODUCTION behind this was to conduct a research on both the deficiencies indicated in past researches {{and the location of}} manual transmission gear operated by the right arm. One of the most important aspects in the design of The levels of each package variables were decided in vehicles system lies in the creation of an interior consideration of major design measures of mid-size...|$|E
40|$|This study {{hypothesized}} that {{a lack of}} lower extremity muscle activation explains why midshaft femur fracture cannot be reproduced in frontal impact experimental tests by impacting the knees of unembalmed cadavers. To test this hypothesis, a new lower-extremity finite element model (LX FE Model) of a midsize U. S. male was developed that included regional variability in cortical bone thickness, directionally dependent cortical-bone material properties, and a complete set of lower-extremity muscles with associated muscle mass. This model was validated by simulating biomechanical tests in which whole seated cadavers and cadaver segments were impacted using loading conditions similar to those produced in frontal motor-vehicle crash testing. Muscle forces for use in simulations with the LX FE Model were estimated using a commercial musculoskeletal model that was validated using EMG and reaction force data from a series of maximum and 50 % maximum one-foot braking tests performed by subjects in a laboratory <b>seating</b> <b>buck.</b> Simulations of knee-to-knee-bolster loading during frontal crashes using the validated LX FE Model with and without the muscle forces predicted by the musculoskeletal model for maximum braking indicate that muscle tension increases the effective mass of the occupant in response to knee-impact loading by increasing the coupling of muscle mass to the skeleton, and thereby increases the forces applied to the knees. Muscle tension also preferentially couples soft-tissue mass to the KTH distal to the hip, which increases the percentage decrease in force between the knee and the hip. The magnitude of this increase is that force transmitted to the hip without muscle tension is similar to force transmitted to the hip with muscle tension despite the higher knee-impact forces with muscle tension. Most importantly, relative to the study hypothesis, simulation results indicate that muscle tension has a meaningful potential to shift fracture location from the hip to the shaft of the femur by increasing bending moments in the femoral shaft...|$|E

40|$|General comfort may {{be defined}} as the "level of well-being" {{perceived}} by humans in a working environment. The state-of-the-art about evaluation of comfort/discomfort shows the need for an objective method to evaluate the "effect in the internal body" and "perceived effects" in main systems of comfort perception. In the early phases of automotive design, the seating and dashboard command can be virtually prototyped, and, using Digital Human Modeling (DHM) software, several kinds of interactions can me modeled to evaluate the ergonomics and comfort of designed solutions. Several studies demonstrated that DHM approaches are favorable in virtual reachability and usability tests as well as in macro-ergonomics evaluations, but they appear insufficient in terms of evaluating comfort. Comfort level is extremely difficult to detect and measure; in fact, it is affected by individual perceptions and always depends on the biomechanical, physiological, and psychological state of the tester during task execution. These parameters cannot be modeled using software and instead have to be tested on physical models. A <b>seating</b> <b>buck</b> is often used to prototype a driver's seat, and virtual, mixed, and augmented reality devices help designers to improve ergonomics and comfort of a human-machine interface (HMI). In such environments, both postural and cognitive comfort can be evaluated, but often, testers' opinions are affected by devices, their interaction with designers, and especially, posture analysis systems. One solution to this kind of perception alteration can be found in non-invasive acquisition methods, such as acoustic, magnetic, or optical methods. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages, but all share the same characteristics: they are expensive and difficult to calibrate and use. This paper presents a new method for objectifying and evaluating postural and cognitive comfort levels based on human posture analysis and a questionnaire to evaluate cognitive performance. The posture acquisition method employs commercial low-cost cameras on tripods. The comfort evaluation methods, previously developed at the University of Salerno, are based on several experimental test campaigns, statistical processing, and biomedical studies. The method was tested in terms of reachability and usability for automotive drivers and was performed in a B-segment car (FIAT Grande Punto). A sensitivity analysis was performed to correlate the low resolution of the photographic acquisition with the consequent errors in the comfort evaluation. Posture acquisition errors were analyzed using DHM (DELMIA) software...|$|E

5000|$|Newtown {{was founded}} by William Penn in 1684. Newtown {{was one of several}} towns that Penn had {{organized}} around Philadelphia to provide country homes for city residents and to support farming communities. It was the county <b>seat</b> of <b>Bucks</b> County from 1726 until 1813, when it was replaced by a more central Doylestown. After his December 26, 1776 morning march to Trenton, and before the Battle of Princeton, General George Washington made his headquarters in Newtown. Newtown was incorporated on April 16, 1838 and has been enlarged three times since. In 1969 Newtown's entire central business district was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. This designation was largely due to Newtown's historic clock tower. Newtown is enhanced by unique boutiques, colleges, cuisine, a climate for industry, Pennsylvania’s most popular state park (Tyler State Park) and a Heritage Walk that traces the very steps of George Washington. The Law School Admission Council is headquartered in Newtown Township. As a result, many American lawyers have heard of Newtown. The oldest operating movie theater in America is Newtown Theatre at 120 North State Street.|$|R
