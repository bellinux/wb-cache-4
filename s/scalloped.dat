5|$|The adult female {{is mainly}} <b>scalloped</b> and mottled in light brown {{with a more}} uniformly grey-brown head, and its pointed tail is shorter than the male's; it is still easily {{identified}} by its shape, long neck, and long grey bill. In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake pintail looks similar to the female, but retains the male upperwing pattern and long grey shoulder feathers. Juvenile birds resemble the female, but are less neatly <b>scalloped</b> and have a duller brown speculum with a narrower trailing edge.|$|E
5|$|Juveniles {{resemble}} adult females, {{but have}} broken narrow pale edges of underpart feathers, which give a slightly streaked rather than <b>scalloped</b> appearance, {{and the overall}} appearance is browner rather than uniformly blackish. Juvenile males have brownish-orange feet while juvenile females have brownish feet and a dusky greyish-green bill.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all {{mountains}} {{appear to}} be in some stage of degradation. Large landslide deposits are common at the base of Ionian mountains, suggesting that mass wasting is the primary form of degradation. <b>Scalloped</b> margins are common among Io's mesas and plateaus, the result of sulfur dioxide sapping from Io's crust, producing zones of weakness along mountain margins.|$|E

5|$|For pilots, {{knowledge}} of the sky cover helps determine if visual flight rules (VFR) are being met. Knowing the degree of cloud cover can help {{determine whether or not}} various weather fronts, such as cold fronts or warm fronts, have passed by a location. A nephanalysis, contouring areas that are cloudy with <b>scalloped</b> lines, can be performed to indicate a system's cloud and precipitation pattern. This technique is rarely performed nowadays, due to the prevalence of satellite imagery worldwide.|$|E

The variety kinabaluensis (named after its type locality, Kinabalu) has a cap margin that is not <b>scalloped,</b> little or no odor, and cheilocystidia with shorter processes. It was found growing on the dead wood of Lithocarpus havilandii, a stone oak tree in the beech family. Variety subglobospora, found in Sabah, has spores that are almost spherical.|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} research, microsatellite markers {{have been}} used to geographically and phylogenetically characterize and identify populations of sea <b>scallops</b> (Placopecten magellanicus Gmelin). Given that sea <b>scallops</b> are a closely related species to bay <b>scallops</b> (Argopecten irradians Lamarck), we have investigated whether the flanking DNA sequences of sea <b>scallop</b> microsatellite loci have been conserved in the bay <b>scallop.</b> We found that in all seven sets of published sea <b>scallop</b> PCR primers (Pma 130, - 132, - 135, - 180, - 200, - 212, and - 275) that were tested with bay <b>scallop</b> DNA, there was sequence conservation and amplification of microsatellite regions. Our initial phylogenetic analyses, combined with the lack of any null alleles in bay <b>scallops</b> for the tested loci, confirm the close genetic distance between bay and sea <b>scallops.</b> These “new” bay <b>scallop</b> primers can be employed in future studies examining both natural and cultured populations of bay <b>scallop</b> and further inquiries into the phylogeny between bay and sea <b>scallops...</b>|$|R

5|$|Four {{other species}} of hammerhead sharks overlap in range with the smalleye hammerhead: the small-sized scoophead and bonnethead, and the large-sized <b>scalloped</b> hammerhead and great hammerhead. Little {{competition}} occurs between these species because of their differing habitats and dietary preferences. The smalleye hammerhead is the dominant hammerhead in shallow, muddy areas, where high turbidity limits the utility of vision (hence its smaller eyes). Adult males and juveniles of both sexes form schools of uniform body size; these schools {{do not appear to}} relate to reproduction or migration. Adult females are apparently solitary.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) {{rejected}} proposals {{from the}} United States and Palau {{that would have}} required countries to strictly regulate trade in several species of <b>scalloped</b> hammerhead, oceanic whitetip and spiny dogfish sharks. The majority, but not the required two-thirds of voting delegates, approved the proposal. China, by far the world's largest shark market, and Japan, which battles all attempts to extend the convention to marine species, led the opposition. In March 2013, three endangered commercially valuable sharks, the hammerheads, the oceanic whitetip and porbeagle were added to Appendix 2 of CITES, bringing shark fishing and commerce of these species under licensing and regulation.|$|E
5|$|The Cuban macaw had a red {{forehead}} fading {{to orange}} {{and then to}} yellow {{at the nape of}} the neck. It had white unfeathered areas around the eyes, and yellow irises. The face, chin, chest, abdomen and thighs were orange. The legs were brown. The upper back was brownish red with feathers <b>scalloped</b> with green. The rump, undertail feathers, and lower back were blue. The wing feathers were brown, red and purplish blue. The upper surface of the tail was dark red fading to blue at the tip, and the under surface of the tail was brownish red. The beak has variously been described as dark, all-black, and greyish black. The sexes were identical in external appearance, as with other macaws.|$|E

5|$|The Perpendicular Gothic cloister is entered {{from the}} cathedral through a Norman doorway {{in the north}} aisle. The cloister {{is part of the}} {{building}} programme that commenced in the 1490s and is probably the work of Seth Derwall. The south wall of the cloister, dating from the later part of the Norman period, forms the north wall of the nave of the cathedral, and includes blind arcading. Among the earliest remaining structures on the site is an undercroft off the west range of the cloisters, which dates from the early 12thcentury, and which was originally used by the monks for storing food. It consists of two naves with groin vaults and short round piers with round <b>scalloped</b> capitals.|$|E
5|$|The {{adult male}} has a dark grey beak and pink eye-rings. The adult female has a bone-coloured beak, grey eye-rings and ear patches that are whiter and more {{distinctive}} {{than those of}} the male. The feathers of its underparts and underwing coverts have larger white margins {{than those of the}} male, leading to a more barred or <b>scalloped</b> pattern to its plumage. Its legs and feet are a little lighter than those of the male. Moulting appears to take place in stages in late summer—some time between January or February and April or May, and is poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|The {{mistle thrush}} is much larger, paler and longer-tailed than the {{sympatric}} song thrush. In the western Himalayas {{it could be}} confused with both the plain-backed and the long-tailed thrushes. These {{are similar to the}} mistle thrush, but the plain–backed thrush lacks obvious wing bars, is more rufous above than its relative, and is barred rather than spotted below. The long-tailed thrush has olive-toned upperparts, bars on its breast and two wing bars. Juvenile mistle thrushes are superficially similar to White's thrush, but that species has golden-yellow plumage, <b>scalloped</b> underparts and a distinctive underwing pattern.|$|E

5|$|The western magpie, G. tibicen dorsalis was {{originally}} {{described as a}} separate species by A. J. Campbell in 1895 and {{is found in the}} fertile south-west corner of Western Australia. The adult male has a white back and most closely resembles subspecies telonocua, though it is a little larger with a longer bill and the black tip of its tail plumage is narrower. The female is unusual in that it has a <b>scalloped</b> black or brownish-black mantle and back; the dark feathers there are edged with white. This area appears a more uniform black as the plumage ages and the edges are worn away. Both sexes have black thighs.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, Jean Cadenat and Jacques Blache {{revisited}} {{the type}} specimens of S. tudes {{and found that}} the lectotype from Nice is likely not a smalleye hammerhead, but rather a fetal whitefin hammerhead (S. couardi, likely a synonym of the <b>scalloped</b> hammerhead, S. lewini). This would also explain the anomalous locality of the Nice specimen, as the smalleye hammerhead is not otherwise known outside of the Americas. By the rules of binomial nomenclature, Sphyra tudes should then become the valid name for the whitefin hammerhead, taking precedence over S. couardi, and the smalleye hammerhead would revert to being Sphyrna bigelowi. Taxonomists, though, have been reluctant to change the names again, preferring to keep the smalleye hammerhead as S. tudes. For this solution to have official status would require a decision by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN), to reject the Nice specimen as the lectotype and designate the Cayenne specimen in its place. The relevant petition to the ICZN has not yet been put forth.|$|E
5|$|The face, lores, throat, breast, {{belly and}} rump {{of this species}} are white; the undersides are tinged with grey on the chest and yellow on the belly. The crown is glossy black in males. The nape is pale grey with a grey-white to white band {{separating}} the crown from the back. The wings are dusky greyish brown with white edging on the inner remiges and wing-coverts. The tail is dusky brown, and the stout bill, iris and legs are black. The female {{is similar to the}} male, but is duller overall and has a chestnut-tinged crown. Juvenile birds resemble adults but have greyish napes and more chestnut in the crown, and the feathers of the back, rump and primaries are <b>scalloped</b> with ochre.

5|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the ocellated electric ray is heart- or trowel-shaped and slightly wider than long. A pair of large, kidney-shaped electric organs are {{visible through the}} skin {{on either side of}} the head. The small eyes are followed by smaller spiracles, which have seven to ten small, rounded projections on their rims. The snout is broadly rounded, with each nostril divided into two openings by a strut. Between the nostrils is a curtain of skin with a smooth to gently wavy posterior margin. The small mouth forms a transverse line; the edge of the lower jaw is <b>scalloped,</b> and when closed usually conceals the teeth. There are 14–16 tooth rows in each jaw. The small and pointed teeth become progressively longer and sharper towards the back, and are arranged in a quincunx pattern. Five pairs of small gill slits are present on the underside of the disc.|$|E
5|$|Ben Youssef Mosque, {{distinguished}} by its green tiled roof and minaret, {{is located in}} the medina and is Marrakesh's oldest mosque. It was originally built in the 12th century by the Almoravid Sultan Ali ibn Yusuf in honor of Yusuf ibn Ali al-Sanhaji. When built it was the city's largest mosque but today it is half its original size. It was rebuilt in the 1560s by Saadian Sultan Abdallah al-Ghalib, as the original had fallen into ruin. He also built a madrasa with a large library beside the mosque, but this also deteriorated over time, leaving only the 19th-century mosque intact. The Almoravid Koubba Ba’adiyn, a two-storied kiosk, was discovered in a sunken location on the mosque site in 1948. In the Moroccan architectural style, its arches are <b>scalloped</b> on the first floor, while those on the second floor bear a twin horseshoe shape embellished with a turban motif. The dome of the kiosk is framed by a battlement decorated with arches and seven-pointed stars. The interior of the octagonally arched dome is decorated with distinctive carvings bordered by a Kufic frieze inscribed with the name of its patron, Sultan Ali ibn Yusuf. The quinches at the corners of the dome are covered with muqarnas. The kiosk has motifs of pine cones, palms and acanthus leaves which are also replicated in the Ben Youssef Madrasa.|$|E
5|$|The M3 saw {{action for}} the first time during the defense of the Philippines in December 1941. It {{went on to become a}} factor in the Guadalcanal Campaign, where it was {{successfully}} employed against both Japanese armor and infantry. Throughout the war it remained effective against Japanese vehicles, which were thinly armored and were rarely committed in large groups. The light weight of the gun made it easy to move through difficult terrain; for example, when attacked by Japanese tanks on Betio during the Battle of Tarawa, Marines were able to heave the M3 over the -high seawall. While high-explosive and canister ammunition proved useful in stopping Japanese infantry attacks, against enemy fortifications the M3 was only somewhat effective because of its small high-explosive projectile. Its overall effectiveness and ease of use meant the gun remained in service with the Marine Corps and with some army units in the Pacific until the end of the war. Unhappy with the unusually low shield of the M3, some Marine Corps units extended it to provide better protection. These extensions sometimes had a <b>scalloped</b> top edge, intended to improve camouflage. A standard kit was tested in 1945, but was never issued.|$|E
