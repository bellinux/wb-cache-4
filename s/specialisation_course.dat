The pedagogical and didactical approach must face different external condition such as the duration of each lecture, the predictable drop of paying attention and the resulting necessity of different kind of activities. Several actions have been introduced in our lectures, as oral presentation of a self-chosen topic, intensive use of TICs, case studies, production of a poster, specific seminary on IR thermography, conference about energy classification, field trips, one minute papers. All this activities not only focus program-specific and professional competences, related to the academic discipline and a better knowledge and understanding of physical, thermodynamic laws or construction elements, but also want to train core and cross-cultural competences such as communication, management of information, teamwork, continuous learning, strategic thinking, cross-cultural behaviour, with a view to the final project presentation.

Both universities have a rich history in gender studies, but represent different perspectives within sociology. Looking at both curricula, a general image emerges of social-cultural man-woman differences and sexuality as themes, but these are not anchored in the final attainment level, which makes the individual role of the lectures quite big. In the required readings there is hardly any attention for a gender perspective in which students learn to apply gender as an analytical category. However, both universities offer a wide selection of <b>specialisation</b> <b>courses</b> to interested students. Here, opportunities seem to be missed to apply gender studies within sociology as a bridge between different disciplines and methodological approaches. This exploration ends with a brief outline of the further anchoring of gender and sexuality studies in the sociology curriculum on basis of three educational strategies...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{refers to}} a case study on the {{application}} of Internet technology in activities of distance education. The pedagogical trend of these activities enables the social-cultural approach to the knowledge production and its application takes place through {{the establishment of a}} virtual environment for co-operative learning {{in the form of a}} computational system. Nowadays, a series of computational systems are intended to give support to the educational process using Internet as a means for interaction among teachers and students. This virtual environments offer interaction, but, by themselves, they do not guarantee interactive communication between those involved in the learning process. Proposals like the development of “virtual learning communities”, where groups of people can cooperage to produce knowledge, indicate the need for readaptation, or even, for the creation of knew models that privilege the communication and processes of co-authrship and the shared production of didactic material, on-line or not, among others. In this study, we consolidate the theoretical foundations related to environments of network co-operative learning, and we analyse the existing informatics tools to give support to educational environments in Internet, aiming their characterisation according to various ways of access and use. Based on the theoretical foundations and on the analysis of the existing tools, here it is identified the group of resources and technologies that, implemented together, can make up an environment capable of enabling educational activities based on co-operation.

40|$|Abstract Background Neuro-oncological {{population}} well {{expresses the}} complexity of neurological disability due to the multiple neurological deficits that affect these patients. Moreover, due to the therapeutical opportunities survival times for patients with brain tumor have increased and more of these patients require rehabilitation care. The figure of nurse in the interdisciplinary specialty of neurorehabilitation is not clearly defined, even if their role in this setting is recognized as being critical and is expanding. The {{purpose of the study}} is to identify the standard competencies for neurorehabilitation nurses that could be taught by means of a specialization course. Methods A literature review was conducted with preference given to works published between January 2000 and December 2008 in English. The search strategy identified 523 non-duplicated references of which 271 titles were considered relevant. After reviewing the abstracts, 147 papers were selected and made available to a group of healthcare professionals who were requested to classify them in few conceptual main areas defining the relative topics. Results The following five main areas were identified: clinical aspects of nursing; nursing techniques; nursing methodology; relational and organisational models; legal aspects of nursing. The relative topics were included within each area. As educational method a structured course based on lectures and practical sessions was designed. Also multi-choices questions were developed in order to evaluate the participants’ level of knowledge, while a semi-structured interview was prepared to investigate students’ satisfaction. Conclusions Literature shows that the development of rehabilitation depends on the improvement of scientific and practical knowledge of health care professionals. This structured training course could be incorporated into undergraduate nursing education programmes and also be inserted into continuing education programmes for graduate nurses. Developing expertise in neuro-rehabilitation for nurses, will be critical to improve overall care and care management of patients with highly complex disabilities as patients affected by brain tumors. The next step will be to start discussing, at the level of scientific societies linked to the field of neurorehabilitation and oncology, the development of a <b>specialisation</b> <b>course</b> in neurorehabilitation nursing. </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims {{to explore}} the theme of teachers’ {{inclusive}} attitudes, offering a new theoretical and methodological approach of investigation. Concentrating on teachers’ understanding of inclusion, this study examines the complexity of relations between values and practice highlithing some critical aspects related to the transition of inclusive attitudes into inclusive practice. Moreover, the attention focuses also {{on the role of}} teacher education in developing and promoting inclusive attitudes, in order to understand and idenitify possible implementation for intial teacher education and ongoing training. Framing the interpretation of inclusion and inclusive education adopted in this work, particularly related to the development of those concepts at a local and international level, this work takes critically into account the Italian background, where the policy of integrazione scolastica has been established for almost forty years, but where there still are situation of intra-exclusion. The theoretical framework, embracing the idea of inclusion and inclusive education in their wider meaning, proposes an original rationale for studying inclusive attitudes with a qualitative approach, formulating a model configuration that supports the empirical investigation. Methodologically, the study is carried on with the creation of an art-mediated tool through which twenty six interviews to teachers in service, (K 13) attending a <b>specialisation</b> <b>course</b> on qualified support teaching, have been conducted. Data analysis, software aided, is based on a multi phase content coding and a network/table representation, using a top-down/bottom-up approach. Outcomes are then further interpreted and discussed integrating excerpts form teachers’ interviews. Outcomes show that teachers demonstrate inclusive attitudes despite these are then hardly put into practice chiefly due to systemic factors, such as a lack of general teacher preparation on inclusion-related topics and so on. The complexity of relations between values and practice implicates that more efforts and changes need to be taken in order to positively transferr inclusive values into action. In fact, teachers’ inclusive attitudes seem to find barriers in the everyday school practice. Given the results of this study, it is possible to argue that the process from integrazione scolastica to inclusion needs to be further investigated within the Italian background, adopting a critical approach and possibly through cross-cultural research with other countries that are experiencing a passage towards a more inclusive education. ...|$|E

Part of this work was {{in the form of}} a survey of pharmacy education, practice, and legislation in the various member states. We will publish the individual member state surveys as reference documents. This paper presents the results of the PHARMINE survey on pharmacy education, training, and practice in the Czech Republic. Czech community pharmacies sell and provide advice on Rx and Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines; they also provide diagnostic services (e. g., blood pressure measurement). Pharmacists (lékárník in Czech) study for five years and graduate with a Magister (Mgr., equivalent to M. Pharm.) degree. The Mgr. diploma is the only requirement for registration as a pharmacist. Pharmacists can own and manage community pharmacies, or work as responsible pharmacists in pharmacies. All practising pharmacists must be registered with the Czech Chamber of Pharmacists. The ownership of a community pharmacy is not restricted to members of the pharmacy profession; the majority of pharmacies are organised into various pharmacy chains. There are two universities providing higher education in pharmacy in the Czech Republic: the Faculty of Pharmacy in Hradec Kralove, Charles University, which was established in 1969, and the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences in Brno, which was established in 1991. The pharmacy curriculum is organized as a seamless, fully integrated, five-year master degree course. There is a six-month traineeship supervised by the university, which usually takes place during the fifth year. Thus, the pharmacy curriculum is organised in accordance with the EU directive on sectoral professions that lays down the imperatives for pharmacy education, training, and practice in the various member states of the EU. Currently, no <b>specialisation</b> <b>courses</b> are available at the university level. Specialisation is organised in the form of postgraduate, continuing professional development by the Czech Chamber of Pharmacists, and delivered by the Institute of Postgraduate Education for Health Professions...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Tourism)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2004. Ecotourism {{is one of}} the {{fastest-growing}} sectors of the tourism industry worldwide. Sustained development and success of the industry depends on the availability of suitably trained manpower. Formal educational programmes to service the ecotourism industry are, like the term ecotourism, a relatively new phenomenon and higher education programmes to educate and train human resources for this important sector are relatively rare. Although a number of higher education institutions in South Africa are offering <b>specialisation</b> <b>courses</b> in ecotourism, these {{do not seem to be}} altogether successful in meeting the needs of industry. The aim of this study was to design an ecotourism curriculum for higher education institutions in South Africa, with special reference to Technicon, which could also be used as a basis for developing programmes in other institutions and countries. A two-pronged approach was followed: a literature study as well as a survey. The survey included focus group meetings, workshops, questionnaires and interviews. The Delphi technique was used, consisting of 4 rounds of electronic questionnaires that were sent to 80 selected panel members. The study endeavoured to differentiate ecotourism from other forms of tourism as a base on which to justify the development of formal educational programmes. Jobs and career-paths within the ecotourism sector were identified, followed by an identification of the knowledge, skills and attributes required for the career paths and the levels within each career path. This resulted in a comprehensive database of the desired outcomes for an ecotourism programme. This was consequently compared with the curriculum of the existing 4 -year B Tech: Ecotourism Management programme offered by 3 Technicons in South Africa, which highlighted the deficiencies in the existing programme. Additional educational themes were identified, including the following: Tourism Anthropology and Cultural and Heritage Tourism, as ecotourism is not only the interpretation of the natural environment but also of all the cultural manifestations of the particular destination; English Communication, as employees in the tourism industry need to be confident and expert in the skills of speaking and writing; a foreign and an indigenous language; Information Management; Leisure Appreciation; and IT applications focusing on the ecotourism industry, such as e-commerce and on-line marketing. Subject themes with too high a credit value in the existing programme were found to be Biology, Wildlife Management and Interpretation. On the basis of the above an ecotourism curriculum was developed, based on jobs and career-paths identified by stakeholders in the ecotourism sector of the tourism industry and designed by academics, knowledgeable in the field of both tourism/ecotourism education and curriculum design.
