40|$|Screening or sieving is an {{important}} unit operation to separate particles {{on the basis of}} size by a screening surface which will either accept or reject particles. In spite of its wide application, the understanding of this process is still limited, particularly considering the large number of variables which are related to the screen geometries, operational conditions and particle properties. A better understanding of the process can lead to improvements on the performance and has a great economic significance. Generally, a screening involves two processes: stratification (or percolation) and the passage of free particles through the apertures, in which a particle always experiences complicated particle-particle and particle-wall interactions. Therefore, it is essential to study screening processes at a particle scale. In this work, numerical models based on the Discrete Element Method (DEM) are developed, which readily provides information at a particle scale that can help understand the process better but hardly be obtained from physical experiments. Using DEM, different screening processes have been studied. Firstly, particle percolation in a vibrated screen is investigated. The effects of vibration amplitude and frequency on the percolation behaviours are studied in terms of percolation velocity, residence time distribution and radial dispersion. Further analysis of the diffusion coefficient and porosity shows that the percolation behaviours can be related to the dimensionless vibrational velocity (Vb) for different amplitudes and frequencies. Interestingly, it is found that the percolation velocity can be linked to the dimensionless vibrational velocity, and the critical percolation velocity can always be achieved when Vb equals 2, which corresponds to the onset of the fluidized state. Secondly, a numerical study of particle &# 64258;ow and sieving behaviour in a sieve-shaker is presented, with the sieve-shaker consisting of three sieves in one column. The e&# 64256;ects of variables like vibrational amplitude and frequency, volume ratio and sliding and rolling friction coefficients are studied through a series of controlled numerical experiments. Such a process is modelled by reaction kinetics. The sieving performance is then analysed in terms of <b>sieving</b> <b>rate</b> constant (the kinetic rate) for different sized particles at the top, middle and bottom screens, and a mathematical model is proposed to link <b>sieving</b> <b>rate</b> constant with the considered variables, which can satisfactorily estimate the process kinetics. Finally, the effect of aperture shape, sliding friction coefficient, moisture content and feed rate in different vibration conditions in a vibrated screening process are studied through a series of controlled numerical experiments. The sieving performance is analysed in terms of overall percentage passings of different sized particles and the distribution of percentage passing along the screen deck. The performance of such a screening process is shown to be related to particle &# 64258;ow on the screen such as the structure of particle bed, particle velocities and particle-screen interactions. The sieving behaviour of individual particles is analysed based on the microdynamics information, particularly the particle-screen interactions. On this basis, the probability of a single attempt and the number of attempts for a particle to pass an aperture are modelled which are linked to the macroscopical sieving performance. The results are useful for developing a fundamental understanding of the effect of operational conditions, particle properties and screen geometries on sieving, which will help design, control and optimise practical processes...|$|E

Gas volume and gas quality (CH 4 and CO 2) measurements were collected continuously with the Dolly Digester system by Belach Bioteknikk.

Initial antibiotic dose {{should be based on}} published volume of distribution and generally be at least the standard dose, as volume of distribution is usually unchanged or increased. Subsequent doses should be based on total clearance. Total clearance varies with the CRRT clearance which mainly depends on effluent flow <b>rate,</b> <b>sieving</b> coefficient/saturation coefficient. As antibiotic clearance by healthy kidneys is usually higher than clearance by CRRT, except for colistin, subsequent doses should generally be lower than given to patients without renal dysfunction.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the frequentist posterior contraction rate of nonparametric Bayesian procedures in linear inverse problems {{in both the}} mildly and severely ill-posed cases. A theorem is proved in a general Hilbert space setting under approximation-theoretic assumptions on the prior. The result is applied to non-conjugate priors, notably sieve and wavelet series priors, {{as well as in}} the conjugate setting. In the mildly ill-posed setting minimax optimal rates are obtained, with <b>sieve</b> priors being <b>rate</b> adaptive over Sobolev classes. In the severely ill-posed setting, oversmoothing the prior yields minimax rates. Previously established results in the conjugate setting are obtained using this method. Examples of applications include deconvolution, recovering the initial condition in the heat equation and the Radon transform.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{behavior}} of some nonlinear semiparametric models in the case where the unknown nuisance function f is not necessarily differentiable. Two models are considered, in the Gaussian white noise framework: estimation {{of the center of}} symmetry and estimation of the period of a periodic signal. We obtain the rate of convergence of the sieve maximum likelihood estimators in these models over different functional spaces. In particular, it is shown that if the class controls appropriately the growth to infinity of the Fisher information over the <b>sieve,</b> semiparametric fast <b>rates</b> of convergence are obtained. We also prove a lower bound result which implies that these semiparametric rates are strictly below the parametric ones, meaning there is a significant loss of information, contrary to the regular case...|$|R

The commercial hygrometer used in this study permitted measurement of water content in the range 0. 005 – 5 % (by vol) but was subject to a number of limitations which made measurements more time-consuming than anticipated. Grossly wet ethanol containing 5 % (by vol) water was readily dried to a water content of about 0. 3 % (by vol), by treatment with a column of 3 A molecular <b>sieves.</b> Slow flow <b>rates</b> enhanced the drying action, which was largely independent of the column dimensions and scale of the drying process.

The underlying nuisance function f is not assumed to be differentiable, which makes a new point of view to the problem necessary.

In the past, plastic reclaimers used the resin identification code (RIC), a method of categorization of polymer types, which {{was developed by the}} Society of the Plastics Industry in 1988. Polyethylene terephthalate, commonly referred to as PET, for instance, has a resin code of 1. Most plastic reclaimers do not rely on the RIC now; they use automatic sort systems to identify the resin, ranging from manual sorting and picking of plastic materials to mechanized automation processes that involve shredding, <b>sieving,</b> separation by <b>rates</b> of density i.e. air, liquid, or magnetic, and complex spectrophotometric distribution technologies e.g. UV/VIS, NIR, Laser, etc. Some plastic products are also separated by color before they are recycled. The plastic recyclables are then shredded. These shredded fragments then undergo processes to eliminate impurities like paper labels. This material is melted and often extruded into the form of pellets which are then used to manufacture other products.|$|R

40|$|This paper aims at {{developing}} a quasi-Bayesian {{analysis of the}} nonparametric instrumental variables model, {{with a focus on}} the asymptotic properties of quasi-posterior distributions. In this paper, instead of assuming a distributional assumption on the data generating process, we consider a quasi-likelihood induced from the conditional moment restriction, and put priors on the function-valued parameter. We call the resulting posterior quasi-posterior, which corresponds to ``Gibbs posterior'' in the literature. Here we focus on priors constructed on slowly growing finite-dimensional <b>sieves.</b> We derive <b>rates</b> of contraction and a nonparametric Bernstein-von Mises type result for the quasi-posterior distribution, and rates of convergence for the quasi-Bayes estimator defined by the posterior expectation. We show that, with priors suitably chosen, the quasi-posterior distribution (the quasi-Bayes estimator) attains the minimax optimal rate of contraction (convergence, resp.). These results greatly sharpen the previous related work. Comment: Published in at [URL] the Annals of Statistics ([URL] by the Institute of Mathematical Statistics ([URL]...|$|R

Orange juice inoculated with E. coli (106 CFU mL- 1) as a challenge microorganism was treated with ozone at 75 - 78 µg mL- 1 for different time periods (0 - 18 min). The efficacy of ozone for inactivation of both strains of E. coli was evaluated {{as a function of}} different juice types: model orange juice, fresh unfiltered juice, juice without pulp, and juice filtered through 500 mm or 1 mm <b>sieves.</b> Fast inactivation <b>rates</b> for total reduction of E. coli were achieved in model orange juice (60 seconds) and in juice with low pulp content (6 min). However, in unfiltered juice inactivation was achieved after 15 - 18 min. This indicated that juice organic matter interferes with antibacterial activity of gaseous ozone. The effect of prior acid (pH 5. 0) exposure of E. coli strains on the inactivation efficacy of ozone treatment was also investigated. There was a strain effect observed, where prior acid exposure resulted in higher inactivation times in some cases by comparison with the control cells. However, the overarching influence on inactivation efficacy of ozone was related to the pulp content. Generally, the applied gaseous ozone treatment of orange juice resulted in a population reduction of 5 log cycles...|$|R

The experiments were conducted to study the effect of speed of mill, <b>sieve</b> size, feed <b>rate</b> and time of grinding on power consumption and average particle diameter of water chestnut in continuous grinding process. Power consumption was measured for a constant feed rate of 1 and 2 kg/h at different speed of the mill varied from 800 to 1200 rpm for the sieve openings of 0. 5 mm, 1. 0 mm and 2. 0 mm. For all the sieve sizes and feed rates, {{it was observed that}} as the speed of the mill increases, there is an increase in power consumption and found significantly low for higher sieve size and lower feed rate. The size distribution of the water chestnut kernel for different speeds and sieve sizes at constant feed rate were obtained by sieve analysis.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{modeling and}} simulation studies of distillation column. This study is to stimulate <b>sieve</b> tray distillation (<b>rate</b> based model) and specifically for multiple columns process by using Aspen Hysys. The economic importance of distillation separations has been a driving force for the research in synthesis procedures for more than 30 years. Distillation accounts for almost 90 % of the separation systems used in chemical process industries. The best way to reduce operating costs of existing units is to improve their efficiency and operation via process optimization and control. Simulation generates one or more trajectories (possible behaviors from the high-level model), and collects statistics from these trajectories to estimate the desired performance or dependability measures. Modeling and simulation of distillation column might already be very familiar but {{modeling and simulation}} of multicomponent distillation in multiple columns still yet being commercially introduced to the industries. In this project, the well known kind of multi components (n-butane, n-pentane and benzene) is chosen as the example to run this simulation by using multiple distillation columns. By inserting the details and specifications in Aspen Hysys, multicomponents distillation process is stimulated under steady state condition. From the result gained, calculations such as compositions, temperature, mass balance and energy balance can be done step by step. The composition, k values, temperature and flowrate will be further explained in discussion. Other than that, the limitations of steady state techniques are discussed, {{and the need for}} rigorous dynamic simulation for final selection of a workable and robust strategy is illustrate...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{study the}} {{cefpirome}} pharmacokinetics {{of patients with}} sepsis and multiple organ failure treated with CVVH. DESIGN: Measurements of serum and ultrafiltrate (UF) concentrations and in vitro sensitivity testing of isolated micro-organisms. SETTING: University hospital-based, single ICU. PATIENTS: Six critically ill CVVH-dependent patients with sepsis and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome in need of antimicrobial therapy. Age range: 60 - 75 years; APACHE II score for severity of illness on admission: 19 - 30. One patient survived. INTERVENTIONS: Cefpirome i. v. was started at 2 g in 30 min, then continued 1 g i. v. b. i. d. MEASUREMENTS: The UF rate was 27 +/- 7 ml/min on day 1 and 34 +/- 2 ml/min on day 2. Serum and ultrafiltrate samples were measured by a validated high performance liquid chromatography assay. Volume of distribution: 23 x 5 (SD +/- 4 x 6) l. Total cefpirome clearance was 32 +/- 6 x 3 ml/min; cefpirome CVVH clearance (ClCVVH) : 17 +/- 4. 2 ml/min; mean serum half-life (t 1 / 2) : 8. 8 +/- 2. 3 h; mass transfer on day 1 : 660 +/- 123 mg/ 12 h (33 +/- 6 % of administered dose) and day 2 : 642 +/- 66 mg/ 12 h (64 +/- 7 %). Estimated <b>sieving</b> coefficient (ClCVVH/UF <b>rate)</b> : 64 +/- 11 %. In vitro sensitivity of isolated microbes was excellent except for two non-sensitive enterococci and Candida spp. CONCLUSIONS: The sieving coefficient (64 %) indicates that a substantial fraction of the drug is not filtered; clearance by pathways other than CVVH mounted to 50 % of the total clearance and increased on day 2, indicating that the dosing schedule used is appropriate for this setting. Cefpirome appeared to be safe in these patients and effective {{for most of the}} nosocomial microbial isolates.
