50|$|The {{development}} {{in the beginning of}} the 20th century resulted in the need for a larger factory, as the company located at the center of the historic city became too small. A spacious factory for constructing hydraulic fruit, wine and oil presses was built. After the Second World War the Dieffenbacher group specialized in heavy equipment construction and could gain ground in the timber industry in 1954. The first chipboard and inlay presses were built. Furthermore, plywood facilities and pattern facilities to refine chipboards were adopted in the product range. In the mid-60’s Dieffenbacher developed a <b>spotting</b> <b>press</b> with pivoting slide plates and extendable desk. This type of press is the precursor of today’s tryout press. From 1960’s onwards Dieffenbacher built presses for fiber-reinforced polyester plastic processing and became the market leader of this branch in the 1970s. With the entry of Wolf-Gerd Dieffenbacher as managing director in 1980 the development to a complete system manufacturer and the internationalization of the company with numerous start-ups, acquisitions and worldwide expansion of sales offices and service-centers. The Dieffenbacher group is represented in 22 locations worldwide today.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is a complex design of the <b>spotting</b> <b>press</b> with a nominal force of 500 kN, which is {{intended}} for mating of the both halves of pressing tool for the automotive industry. The press ram is fitted with a hydraulic mechanism which allows the upper clamping board to be tilted in range of 0 ° - 180 ° and removed from the working space of the press along a profile track. The lower clamping board {{is a part of}} moving bolster, which is equipped with a mechanism for lifting and centring. The concept of motion screws is used to drive the ram. Motion screws are mounted in a multiple-part frame and driven by servomotors. The thesis contains background research of the issue, solutions of the main design nodes of the press including calculations, detailed 3 D model of the device and partial drawing documentation...|$|E

60|$|The {{garrison}} did not derive {{any immediate}} advantage, after all, {{from the death}} of Evan, for the French were so incensed by the deed which John Lamb had perpetrated that they sent more troops to the <b>spot,</b> and <b>pressed</b> the siege more closely than ever.

60|$|When {{the little}} {{minister}} {{looked out at}} the carriage window, many of the people drew back humbly, but a little boy in a red frock with black <b>spots</b> <b>pressed</b> forward and offered him a sticky parly, which Gavin accepted, though not without a tremor, for children were more terrible to him then than bearded men. The boy's mother, trying not to look elated, bore him away, but her face said that he was made for life. With this little incident Gavin's career in Thrums began. I remembered it suddenly the other day when wading across the wynd where it took place. Many scenes in the little minister's life come back to me in this way. The first time I ever thought of writing his love story as an old man's gift to a little maid since grown tall, was one night while I sat alone in the school-house; on my knees a fiddle that has been my only living companion since I sold my hens. My mind had drifted back to the first time I saw Gavin and the Egyptian together, and what set it wandering to that midnight meeting was my garden gate shaking in the wind. At a gate on the hill I had first encountered these two. It rattled in his hand, and I looked up and saw them, and neither knew why I had such cause to start at the sight. Then the gate swung to. It had just such a click as mine.|$|R

5000|$|Chase then <b>spotted</b> a <b>press</b> {{release from}} Walter Lantz Productions that {{indicated}} they were producing a cartoon short entitled Space Mouse. He imagined a Buck Rogers style strip, starring a mouse in a space suit, and felt {{it would make a}} great comic. Chase called Lantz's office and had them send over a copy of the [...] "Space Mouse" [...] storyboard. It turned out that the cartoon was not what Chase had been expecting at all. It was merely the title of the first cartoon in an intended series, starring Earth-bound characters named Hickory, Dickory, and Doc. Believing that a sci-fi mouse was still a great idea, Chase got together with his writers and artists and began working on the comic book he had in mind.|$|R

5|$|The liner {{had several}} mishaps during her {{passenger}} career. On 2 March 1903, {{an article in}} The Washington Post reported that Merion had run aground shortly after leaving Queenstown while en route to Liverpool from Boston. The ship was freed from her perch near Chicago Knoll by the rising tide, but when she got underway again became stuck fast in almost the same <b>spot.</b> At <b>press</b> time, two British Admiralty tugs had been dispatched to free the ship. Almost exactly a year later, Merion collided with the steamer Clan Grant off Tuskar Rock on 30 March 1904 and was damaged. On 24 December 1912, Merion collided with a tanker off the Delaware coast and sustained damage which included two flooded compartments. The ship was beached below Cross Ledge, but was refloated and made way under her own power back to Philadelphia, after discharging her cargo and passengers.|$|R

50|$|Once Gagnon and {{the four}} Marines were on top, a Japanese pipe was found by Hayes and Sousley and taken near the first flag position, After the {{replacement}} flag was attached to it, Lt. Schrier ordered the replacement flag to be raised and the first flag lowered at the same time. Sgt. Strank, Cpl. Block, Pfc. Hayes, Pfc. Sousley, Pfc. Gagnon, and Pfc. Harold Schultz raised the replacement flag (Navy corpsman John Bradley was incorrectly identified as a flag-raisers until June 23, 2016). In {{order to keep the}} flagstaff in a vertical position, rocks were added around the base and a rope was tied to it and staked down in three <b>spots.</b> Associated <b>Press</b> combat photographer Joe Rosenthal took a black and white photograph of this flag raising which became world-famous. The flag raising was also filmed in color by Sgt. Bill Genaust who was killed in action a few days later.|$|R
