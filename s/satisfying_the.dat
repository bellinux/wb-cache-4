After <b>satisfying</b> <b>the</b> authorities that he had actually been taken prisoner and had not surrendered voluntarily, he returned to his depot at Kimberley. His unit had been disbanded and he was discharged.|$|E

5|$|James {{was born}} in Kirkdale, Liverpool, {{the son of the}} Rev. Dr. David James, who was rector of Panteg, Monmouthshire, from 1856 to 1871. Herbert James was educated at King Henry VIII Grammar School, Abergavenny, and then studied at two Oxford colleges. He matriculated at Jesus College in 1863, before winning a {{scholarship}} and moving along Turl Street to Lincoln College in 1864, obtaining a first-class degree in Literae Humaniores in 1867. He was appointed a Fellow of St John's College in 1869 and was President of the Oxford Union Society in 1871 (where he nominated H. H. Asquith to the Standing Committee). He was then ordained, and received his Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1874. Later, on 31 May 1895, he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Divinity, having previously been excused by the University from <b>satisfying</b> <b>the</b> requirements normally set for the award of the degree.|$|E
5|$|Several years later, {{according}} to a narration collected by historian Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad was involved with a well-known story about setting the Black Stone {{in place in the}} wall of the Kaaba in 605 CE. The Black Stone, a sacred object, was removed during renovations to the Kaaba. The Meccan leaders could not agree which clan should return the Black Stone to its place. They decided to ask the next man who comes through the gate to make that decision; that man was the 35-year-old Muhammad. This event happened five years before the first revelation by Gabriel to him. He asked for a cloth and laid the Black Stone in its center. The clan leaders held the corners of the cloth and together carried the Black Stone to the right spot, then Muhammad laid the stone, <b>satisfying</b> <b>the</b> honour of all.|$|E

5|$|While Pierce {{was popular}} and outgoing, his family {{life was a}} grim affair, with his wife Jane {{suffering}} from illness and depression for much of her life. All of their children died young, their last son being gruesomely killed in a train accident while the family was traveling shortly before Pierce's inauguration. As president, Pierce simultaneously attempted to enforce neutral standards for civil service while also <b>satisfying</b> <b>the</b> diverse elements of the Democratic Party with patronage, an effort which largely failed and turned many in his party against him. Pierce was a Young America expansionist who signed the Gadsden Purchase of land from Mexico and led a failed attempt to acquire Cuba from Spain. He signed trade treaties with Britain and Japan, while his Cabinet reformed their departments and improved accountability, but these successes were overshadowed by political strife during his presidency.|$|E
