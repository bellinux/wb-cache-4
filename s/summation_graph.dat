40|$|We {{continue}} and extend earlier {{work on the}} <b>summation</b> of planar <b>graphs</b> in phi^ 3 field theory, based on a local action on the world sheet. The present work employs a somewhat different version of the self consistent field (meanfield) approximation compared to the previous work on the same subject. Using this new approach, {{we are able to}} determine in general the asymptotic forms of the solutions, {{and in the case of}} one solution, even its exact form. This solution leads to formation of an unstable string, in agreement with the previous work. We also investigate and clarify questions related to Lorentz invariance and the renormalization of the solution. Comment: Latex, no other macros neede...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{statistical}} {{properties of the}} scattering matrix associated with generic quantum graphs. The scattering matrix is the quantum analogue of the classical evolution operator on the graph. For the energy-averaged spectral form factor of the scattering matrix we have recently derived an exact combinatorial expression. It {{is based on a}} sum over families of periodic orbits which so far could only be performed in special graphs. Here we present a simple algorithm implementing this <b>summation</b> for any <b>graph.</b> Our results are in excellent agreement with direct numerical simulations for various graphs. Moreover we extend our previous notion of an ensemble of graphs by considering ensemble averages over random boundary conditions imposed at the vertices. We show numerically that the corresponding form factor follows the predictions of random-matrix theory when the number of vertices is large [...] -even when all bond lengths are degenerate. The corresponding combinatorial sum has a structure s [...] ...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} the 2 PPI expansion which sums the bubble graphs to all orders. We {{show that this}} expansion can be renormalised with the usual counterterms in a mass independent scheme. We discuss its application to the O(N) linear σ-model. 1 Over the years, the <b>summation</b> of bubble <b>graphs</b> has attracted {{a lot of interest}} because of the need to resort to non-perturbative approaches in quantum field theory at finite temperature [1]. In het O(N) linear σ-model, bubble graphs were originally [2] summed using the N → ∞ approach. For finite N, it took some while to overcome combinatorial problems [3], but finally consistent results were obtained in [4, 5], using the CJT [6] formalism. There were still some problems though with renormalization which could only be implemented consistently in the N → ∞ limit. In this letter we discuss the 2 PPI expansion which we introduced in [7], as an approximation scheme for calculating the effective potential of the loca...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} duality between type 0 B {{string theory}} on AdS 5 × S 5 and the planar CFT on N electric D 3 -branes coincident with N magnetic D 3 -branes. It {{has been argued}} that this theory is stable up to a critical value of the ‘t Hooft coupling but is unstable beyond that point. We suggest that from the gauge theory point of view the development of instability is associated with singularity in the dimension of the operator corresponding to the tachyon field via the AdS/CFT map. Such singularities are common in large N theories because <b>summation</b> over planar <b>graphs</b> typically has a finite radius of convergence. Hence we expect transitions between stability and instability for string theories in AdS backgrounds that are dual to certain large N gauge theories: if there are tachyons for large AdS radius then they may be stabilized by reducing the radius below a critical value of order the string scale...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} interacting Bose gas in {{thermal equilibrium}} assuming {{a positive and}} bounded pair potential V (r) such that 0 < ∫ drV (r) = a < ∞. Expressing the partition function by the Feynman-Kac functional integral yields a classical-like polymer representation of the quantum gas. With Mayer <b>graph</b> <b>summation</b> techniques, we demonstrate {{the existence of a}} self-consistent relation ρ(µ) = F(µ − aρ(µ)) between the density ρ and the chemical potential µ, valid in the range of convergence of Mayer series. The function F is equal to the sum of all rooted multiply connected graphs. Using Kac’s scaling Vγ(r) = γ 3 V (γr) we prove that in the mean-field limit γ → 0 only tree diagrams contribute and function F reduces to the free gas density. We also investigate how to extend the validity of the self-consistent relation beyond the convergence radius of Mayer series (vicinity of Bose-Einstein condensation) and study dominant corrections to mean field. At lowest order, the form of function F is shown to depend on single polymer partition function for which we derive lower and 1 upper bounds and on the resummation of ring diagrams which can be analytically performed...|$|R
40|$|Pattern Maximum Likelihood (PML) is {{a method}} of {{probability}} estimation that works well for large alphabets. It does not assume that all elements from the unknown alphabet have been observed. PML outperforms the traditional Maximum Likelihood for sequences, and it is particularly useful when the sample size is small. In this dissertation we study both the theory and application of PML. For the theory part, we extend the previous results on the properties of PML, and also show {{how to find the}} PML distributions analytically for patterns of simple forms. For general patterns, PML probabilities can be approximated using a previously developed EM algorithm, which we will prove to be equivalent to a generalized Gradient Ascend Method. We also use the algorithm to conduct experiments on different distributions and evaluate the performance of PML. In addition, we investigate the calculation of pattern probability. We show that the pattern probability is closely related to symmetric polynomials, and it can be written as a <b>summation</b> over <b>graphs</b> using power sums. Along the way we reveal a relation between pattern probability and the enumeration of certain connected graphs as well as inversion-free trees. For applications, we show how PML can be used to predict the number of new symbols that would appear in a future sample. We conduct experiments on various distributions and compare PML to the method of Good & Toulmin and the method of Efron & Thisted. We demonstrate that PML outperforms the other methods even if the future sample size is large. Finally we apply PML to authenticating the authorship of the Taylor poem, attributed to Shakespeare, and conclude that it is consistent with Efron and Thisted's models. PML deals with samples from a single distribution. In the last part of this dissertation we extend PML to set-patterns where multiple samples are observed from concurrent Bernoulli processes. Analogous to the single-process patterns, we show that for certain forms of set-patterns we can find the exact Set-pattern Maximum Likelihood (SPML) probabilities analytically. Furthermore, for general set- patterns we extend the previous EM algorithm to approximate the SPML probabilities. We also show that for samples taken from Poisson distributions the set-pattern is reduced to the single-process pattern proble...|$|R
