40|$|This study {{introduced}} a formative model {{to investigate the}} utility of importance weighting on <b>satisfaction</b> <b>scores</b> with partial least squares analysis. Based on the bottom-up theory of satisfaction evaluations, the measurement structure for weighted/unweighted domain <b>satisfaction</b> <b>scores</b> was modeled as a formative model, whereas the measurement structure for global <b>satisfaction</b> <b>scores</b> was modeled as a reflective model according to top-down theory. The purpose was {{to see if the}} predictive effect of importance-weighted domain <b>satisfaction</b> <b>scores</b> is stronger than unweighted domain <b>satisfaction</b> <b>scores</b> in predicting global <b>satisfaction</b> <b>scores.</b> Three datasets in life, self, and job satisfaction were analyzed. In the life satisfaction dataset, 237 undergraduates at Central Taiwan University of Science and Technology voluntarily provided their responses. The mean age of respondents was 20. 80 years (SD = 1. 05). In the self-satisfaction dataset, 269 undergraduates at National Taiwan University provided their responses. The mean age of respondents was 19. 78 years (SD = 1. 44). Finally, in the job satisfaction dataset, 557 staff members in seven Taiwan provincial hospitals provided their responses. The mean age of respondents was 35. 87 years (range from 21 to 65, SD = 8. 60). Three measures of domain satisfaction, domain importance, and global satisfaction were collected in each dataset. Partial least squares analysis was used in model estimation. All the results revealed that unweighted domain <b>satisfaction</b> <b>scores</b> have a stronger predictive effect for global satisfaction measures than importance-weighted domain <b>satisfaction</b> <b>scores,</b> indicating that importance weighting on <b>satisfaction</b> <b>scores</b> did not have an empirical benefit...|$|R

40|$|As the U.

S. hospitals. The theoretical framework for this study was based upon CCI and patient satisfaction through the lens of service quality. The research questions were created to understand the relationship between CCI and patient <b>satisfaction</b> <b>scores</b> and weigh the cultural competence components relative to each other and their effect on patient satisfaction. The studyâ??s data was gathered from secondary sources: the HCAHPS and â??Diversity and Disparities: A Benchmark Study of U. S. Hospitals in 2013 â?? (DDBS). Through a multiple linear regression analysis, the findings were CCI does have a significant but weak relationship with patient satisfaction. Leadership, a component of CCI, also resulted in a significant but weak relationship with patient satisfaction. The social change implications of this study are that by understanding the diverse cultural needs of its customers, health care organizations will be able to improve patient <b>satisfaction</b> <b>scores.</b> Understanding the relationship between CCI and patient <b>satisfaction</b> <b>scores</b> will aid health care organizations in determining if these initiatives are worth an investment of resources.

Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP), the estimation of a dynamic panel data model provides evidence that adaptation takes place within a relatively short window of time: changes in living conditions are, for the most part, absorbed by an adjustment of the adaptation level within one year. This leads to the conclusion that the information content of <b>satisfaction</b> <b>scores</b> accentuates recent changes in living conditions. Remote changes are notcaptured by the according survey questions, even if these changes have long-term impact on living conditions.

We empirically examine which commonly used and widely advocated customer feedback metrics are most valuable in predicting future business performance. Using American Customer Satisfaction Index data, we assess the linkages between six different satisfaction and loyalty metrics and COMPUSTAT and CRSP data-based measures of different dimensions of firms' business performance over the period 1994 – 2000. Our results indicate that average <b>satisfaction</b> <b>scores</b> have the greatest value in predicting future business performance and that Top 2 Box <b>satisfaction</b> <b>scores</b> also have good predictive value. We also find that while repurchase likelihood and proportion of customers complaining have some predictive value depending on the specific dimension of business performance, metrics based on recommendation intentions (net promoters) and behavior (average number of recommendations) have little or no predictive value. Our results clearly indicate that recent prescriptions to focus customer feedback systems and metrics solely on customers' recommendation intentions and behaviors are misguided. customer satisfaction, marketing metrics, marketing strategy...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Current {{frequent}} follow-up {{after treatment}} {{for breast cancer}} does not meet its intended aims, but does depend on expensive and scarce specialized knowledge for routine history taking and physical examinations. The study described in this paper compared patient satisfaction with a reduced follow-up strategy, i. e. nurse-led telephone follow-up, to satisfaction with traditional hospital follow-up. Methods Patient satisfaction was assessed among patients (n = 299) who were participants of a randomized controlled trial investigating the cost-effectiveness of several follow-up strategies {{in the first year}} after treatment for breast cancer. Data on patient satisfaction were collected at baseline, three, six and 12 months after treatment, using the Dutch version of Ware's Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire III (PSQ III). In addition to general satisfaction, the PSQ III reports on <b>satisfaction</b> <b>scores</b> for technical competence, interpersonal aspects, and access of care. Regression analysis was used to predict <b>satisfaction</b> <b>scores</b> from whether or not nurse-led telephone follow-up was received. Results Nurse-led telephone follow-up had no statistically significant influence on general patient satisfaction (p = 0. 379), satisfaction with technical competence (p = 0. 249), and satisfaction with interpersonal aspects (p = 0. 662). Regarding access of care, patient <b>satisfaction</b> <b>scores</b> were significantly higher for patients receiving telephone follow-up (p = 0. 015). However, a mean difference at 12 months of 3. 1 points was judged to be not clinically relevant. Conclusions No meaningful differences were found in <b>satisfaction</b> <b>scores</b> between nurse-led telephone and hospital follow-up in the first year after breast cancer treatment. With high <b>satisfaction</b> <b>scores</b> and the potential to substantially reduce clinic visits, nurse-led telephone follow-up may be an acceptable alternative to traditional hospital follow-up.
