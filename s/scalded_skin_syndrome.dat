40|$|AbstractEpidemiological data on staphylococcal <b>scalded</b> <b>skin</b> <b>syndromes</b> (SSSS), {{including}} bullous impetigo (BI) and generalized exfoliative syndrome (GES), are scarce. To better characterize SSSS {{and associated}} Staphylococcus aureus strains, {{we conducted a}} retrospective study of 349 cases collected in France between 1997 and 2007 by the National Reference Centre of Staphylococci. Our results showed a stationary evolution of SSSS cases, with a heterogeneous distribution of cases in France. Although notification was not exhaustive, we estimated an incidence of 0. 56 cases/year/million inhabitants, in accordance with previous studies conducted in France and Europe, with a median age of 2 years old and sex ratios of 1. A seasonal effect was observed, with a higher GES/BI ratio in autumn compared with other seasons, which {{could be explained by}} the impact of viral co-infection. Genetic analysis of S. aureus strains showed that accessory gene regulator (agr) 4, exfoliative toxin A (eta) and B (etb) genes, staphylococcal and enterotoxin-like O (selo) gene and agr 4 etb selo profiles were predominantly associated with GES, whereas agr 2 eta and agr 4 eta selo were more frequently observed with BI. Only one methicillin-resistant strain was found. Protein A (spa) typing identified two main genotypes: spa clonal complex (CC) 159 /sequence-type (ST) 121 (75 %) and spaCC 346 /ST 15 (18 %). spaCC 159 was mainly associated with agr 4 eta etb selo, agr 4 eta selo and agr 4 etb selo, and spaCC 346 was mainly associated with agr 2 eta, suggesting that French SSSS cases are caused by these two main lineages. However, in a multivariate analysis, only etb was independently associated with GES...|$|R

The second-degree scald of mice models were divided into two groups in order to contrastively observe the effect of CO 2 laser on treating <b>scald.</b> <b>Skin</b> detector associating with the histopathologic examination were used to observe the changes of skin texture and pathologic morphology structure. Meanwhile the healing time was recorded about the two groups. The texture of skin surface irradiated CO 2 laser was more glossy and distinct after healing, and the healing time was much faster as well. It was good agreement between skin detector images and histopathological architecture. The result suggests the CO 2 laser can significantly cure the the second-degree scald...|$|R

5000|$|It can {{be caused}} by Exfoliative toxin A. The phyogenic {{superficial}} infection can be divided into two other subdivisions; Impetigo, and non-bullous impetigo. Bullous impetigo is caused by Staphylococcus aureus, which produces exfoliative toxins, whereas non-bullous impetigo is caused by either Staphylococcus aureus, or Streptococcus pyogenes. [...] Thirty percent of all Impetigo cases are related to Bullous impetigo. Bullous impetigo, in newborns, children, or adults who are immunocompromised and/or are experiencing renal failure, can develop into a more severe and generalized form called Staphylococcal <b>scalded</b> <b>skin</b> <b>syndrome</b> (SSSS).

50|$|The main coagulase-positive {{staphylococcus}} is Staphylococcus aureus, {{although not}} all strains of Staphylococcus aureus are coagulase positive. These bacteria can survive on dry surfaces, increasing the chance of transmission. S. aureus is also implicated in toxic shock syndrome; during the 1980s some tampons allowed {{the rapid growth of}} S. aureus, which released toxins that were absorbed into the bloodstream. Any S. aureus infection can cause the staphylococcal <b>scalded</b> <b>skin</b> <b>syndrome,</b> a cutaneous reaction to exotoxin absorbed into the bloodstream. It can also cause a type of septicaemia called pyaemia. The infection can be life-threatening. Problematically, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become a major cause of hospital-acquired infections, and is being, MRSA has also been recognized with increasing frequency in community-acquired infections. The symptoms of a Staph Infection include a collection of pus, such as a boil or furuncle, or abscess. The area is typically tender or painful and may be reddened or swollen.|$|E

5000|$|The {{most common}} {{complications}} of boils are scarring and infection or abscess of the skin, spinal cord, brain, kidneys, or other organs. Infections may also {{spread to the}} bloodstream (bacteremia) and become life-threatening. [...] S. aureus strains first infect the skin and its structures (for example, sebaceous glands, hair follicles) or invade damaged skin (cuts, abrasions). Sometimes the infections are relatively limited (such as a stye, boil, furuncle, or carbuncle), but other times they may spread to other skin areas (causing cellulitis, folliculitis, or impetigo). Unfortunately, these bacteria can reach the bloodstream (bacteremia) and end up in many different body sites, causing infections (wound infections, abscesses, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, pneumonia) that may severely harm or kill the infected person. S. aureus strains also produce enzymes and exotoxins that likely cause or increase the severity of certain diseases. Such diseases include food poisoning, septic shock, toxic shock syndrome, and <b>scalded</b> <b>skin</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Almost any organ system can be infected by S. aureus. Squeezing or cutting boils (and even smaller pimples) in the danger triangle of the face can be particularly dangerous if done outside a medical setting, as blood vessels in this area drain into the brain and can carry serious infections there.|$|E
