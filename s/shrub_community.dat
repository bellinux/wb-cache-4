50|$|Hills, {{alluvial}} fans, and low mountains {{comprise the}} Lahontan sagebrush slopes ecoregion. These areas are rock controlled and their soils lack the fine lacustrine sediments {{that are found}} in lower parts of the Lahontan Basin. Because moisture increases and alkalinity decreases with elevation, the <b>shrub</b> <b>community</b> grades from the greasewood-shadscale community on the basin floor, to a <b>shrub</b> <b>community</b> dominated by Wyoming big sagebrush and the endemic Lahontan sagebrush at higher elevations. Understory grasses increase the productivity towards the northeast, outside the rain shadow influence of the Sierra Nevada. The low hills and mountains of the Lahontan Basin experience frequent summer lightning and fire.

Short-statured pinyon pine and Utah juniper trees with an understory of shrubs and grasses comprise the pinyon-juniper woodland community, occupying dry slopes, hills and mesa tops. Common understory plant species include Gambel oak, big sagebrush, Indian ricegrass, western wheatgrass, galleta and blue grama. The sagebrush shrubland community is dominated by big sagebrush, rabbitbrush, Gambel oak and skunkbrush sumac.

5000|$|A. ligulata {{grows in}} dense <b>shrub</b> <b>communities</b> on sand dunes, {{otherwise}} singly scattered. Fast-growing, it stabilizes sand dunes and regenerates quickly after disturbance, such as overgrazing. It {{is known for}} potential weediness due to rapid regrowth.|$|R
50|$|Harsh {{conditions}} at higher altitudes limit tree growth above the tree line, creating an alpine ecosystem. The tree line at Kenai Fjords is between 750 and 1000 ft above sea level. The alpine regions support shrubby grown to alders, devil's club, elderberry, lady fern, cow parsnip and other plants. Herbaceous plants can grow {{in areas with}} better soils, supporting grasses, Nootka lupine, fireweed and other perennial plants. Higher alpine regions support a dwarf <b>shrub</b> <b>community</b> less than 1 ft high, at a very slow rate of growth. Dwarf plants in this region include bog blueberry, partridgefoot, black crowberry and Aleutian mountainheath, {{all of which are}} vulnerable to damage from foot traffic.|$|E
50|$|The site is of {{considerable}} interest to ecologists in that {{several species of}} exotic woody shrubs have naturalized {{in the area to}} the exclusion of the native woody flora. The exotic shrubs that have become rampant are common buckthorn and common privet. Preferential deer herbivory of native species seems to be the primary cause of this invasion, and a deer exclusion has been attempted. The arboretum also has heavy and repeated infestation with Japanese beetle and this may also {{play a role in the}} dynamics of the <b>shrub</b> <b>community</b> which has developed in the garden over the last seventy years. The arboretum is currently directed by Dr. Ranessa Cooper and hosts art programs and children's programs during the summer.|$|E
50|$|The nearly {{level and}} often barren Lahontan and Tonopah playas contain mudflats, alkali flats, and {{intermittent}} saline lakes, {{such as the}} Black Rock Desert, Carson Sink, and Sarcobatus Flat. Marshes, remnant lakes and playas are all that remain of Pleistocene Lake Lahontan, which was once the size of Lake Erie. Playas occur in the lowest elevation of the Lahontan Basin, and represent the terminus or sink of rivers running east of the Sierra Nevada. The playas fill with seasonal runoff from the surrounding mountains, providing habitat for migratory birds. Black greasewood or four-winged saltbush may grow around the perimeter in {{the transition to the}} salt <b>shrub</b> <b>community,</b> where they often stabilize areas of low sand dunes. This ecoregion has limited grazing potential. Windblown salt dust from exposed playas may affect upland soils and vegetation. The Lahontan and Tonopah playas are important as wildlife habitat, as well as for recreational and military uses.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to wildlife the Range also boasts {{an abundance of}} plant communities. Plant communities and wildlife found on the Range vary with altitude and climate. Most of these plant species can be seen while driving the Mormon Well Road (which can be accessed from the Corn Creek Field Station). The desert <b>shrub</b> <b>community,</b> composed of creosote bush and white bursage are the dominant shrubs in the hottest, lowest elevations of Desert National Wildlife Range. Above the valley floor, Mojave yucca and cactus become abundant. At the upper edge of the desert shrub communities, between approximately 4,200 to 6,000 feet (1300 to 1800 m), black-brush and Joshua tree are dominant. Above 6,000 feet (1800 m) desert woodlands, composed of single-leaf pinyon, Utah juniper, and big sagebrush begin. The coniferous forest communities begin around 7,000 feet (2100 m). From 7,000 to 9,000 feet (2100 to 2700 m) Ponderosa pine and white fir are the dominant trees. Near 10,000 feet (3,000 m) where the growing seasons are the shortest, the only trees surviving are bristlecone pines.|$|E
50|$|By far, the {{dominant}} vegetation sub-type is chaparral. Chaparral {{is composed of}} drought- and fire-tolerant evergreen shrubs that range in height from four to ten feet. Unless recently subjected to fire, or some other type of disturbance, this plant community is generally too dense to penetrate. Another unique <b>shrub</b> <b>community</b> to Southern California is sage scrub, which varies between coastal and inland types. Sage scrub vegetation contains fewer stout, woody shrubs, and more openings with fine, delicate plants. The expansive valley floors between the mountain ranges were plowed and farmed long ago. They are now entirely developed. The precise former native plant cover of the San Fernando, Simi and Santa Clarita Valleys was never adequately recorded. It is suspected that native perennial bunch grasses were dominant elements. Throughout the zone, over ninety-five percent of the native grasslands have been displaced by foreign invasive plants. The most common riparian (stream-related) woodland species are various willows, coast live oak, California sycamore, and Fremont's cottonwood. Less common species that are relics of the last Ice Age include white alder, bigleaf maple, and black cottonwood. On slopes, and in valleys where rainfall concentrates, groves of evergreen coast live oaks are common throughout Benedict Canyon. These evergreen oaks provide food and shelter for numerous species of wildlife. Deeper soiled areas in the Santa Susana Mountains, the Simi Hills and the Santa Monica Mountains support the deciduous valley oak. A widely dispersed tree in the Santa Monica Mountains, {{and to a lesser}} extent in other ranges, is the California black walnut.|$|E
40|$|Reflectance of red (656 - 705 nm) and {{infrared}} (776 - 826 nm) solar radiation and standing crop biomass were measured in three salt marsh communities at intervals of approximately 2 weeks between February and August 1974. Red reflectance declined {{at the onset}} of greening in each community and was correlated with standing crop of green biomass. Infrared reflectance increased substantially in the <b>shrub</b> <b>community</b> but less in the grass and sedge communities.

3000|$|... b). The long burning {{times for}} the woody stems of shrubs and their {{associated}} litter (Engber and Varner 2012) {{would be expected to}} contribute to cambial heating and higher levels of damage to low foliage, leading to higher mortality of trees near shrubs. In contrast, <b>shrub</b> <b>communities</b> associated with riparian areas might produce lower intensity fire and lower tree mortality. When conditions are conducive to fire, however, the severity of fire in riparian <b>shrub</b> <b>communities</b> could be higher due to greater fuel loads (e.g., Olson and Agee 2005, Van de Water and North 2011). Finally, although the aboveground portion of shrubs burns, some patches would likely remain unburned in isolated refugia (e.g., Hylander and Johnson 2010; Kolden et al. 2012, 2015), making the net effect of shrubs on tree mortality unclear.|$|R
40|$|Spectral {{characteristics}} of semi-arid <b>shrub</b> <b>communities</b> were examined using Airborne Imaging Spectrometer (AIS) data {{collected in the}} tree mode on 23 May 1985. Mesic sites with relatively high vegetation density and distinct zonation patterns exhibited greater spectral signature variations than sites with more xeric <b>shrub</b> <b>communities.</b> Spectral signature patterns were {{not directly related to}} vegetation density or physiognomy, although spatial maps derived from an 8 -channel maximum likelihood classification were supported by photo-interpreted surface features. In AIS data, the principal detected effect of shrub vegetation on the alluvial fans is to lower reflectance across the spectrum. These results are similar to those reported during a period of minimal physiological activity in autumn, indicating that shadows cast by vegetation canopies are an important element of soil-vegetation interaction under conditions of relatively low canopy cover...|$|R

40|$|In alpine environments {{facilitator}} species buffer environmental extremes while {{building up}} soil resources above that of open areas. These modulating effects {{are critical for}} the persistence of species out of their optimal range and contribute to increase community-level plant species richness and phylogenetic diversity. We analyzed the effects of seven potential facilitator species with contrasting morphologies on subordinate plant species along a crossed environmental gradient, linking such effects to canopy effects. We also used these patches consisting of multiple shrub species to evaluate {{the effects of the}} whole <b>shrub</b> <b>community</b> on species richness and phylogenetic diversity, and whether such <b>shrub</b> <b>community</b> effects differed along the gradient. We used ecological and phylogenetic data of alpine plant communities along two altitudinal gradients on opposing aspects of the Sierra Nevada Mountains (Spain). As expected, shrubs buffered harsh abiotic conditions by decreasing mean temperatures and increasing relative humidity with regard to open areas. Composition of subordinate plant communities differed among shrubs and among sites, and correlated with relative humidity along the gradient pointing to the dependence of subordinate species on micro-environments created by shrubs. There were a variety of shrub effects on overall plant abundance and richness depending on shrub identity. In the most extreme sites we recorded generally positive effects of the <b>shrub</b> <b>community,</b> which promoted whole-community species richness and phylogenetic diversity despite species-specific effects ranging from clearly negative to positive. Our data therefore show that the effect of different shrub species on plant community richness and phylogenetic diversity is not redundant, as every shrub species may host unique communities, thereby affecting the structure and composition of the whole community...|$|E

30|$|Response {{variables}} {{used in our}} NPMR models included presence-absence {{data for}} each tree species derived from 8888 Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plots located throughout Idaho ([URL] that included both forest and non-forest locations. The Idaho FIA dataset was large enough to include locations across substantial bioclimatic diversity (portions of seven US Environmental Protection Agency (2013) level-III ecoregions) but small enough to exclude distant populations and genotypes; thus, allowing us to model regionally adapted tree populations through their relationships with climate of the central Rocky Mountains and nearby locations. Although FIA coordinates are randomly obscured to within 1  km of actual sample location, predictor variable and projected species distributions {{have been shown to}} be generally statistically equivalent for models built with true versus obscured FIA locations (Gibson et al. 2014). The same FIA plot locations were also overlaid with a vegetation map developed by the LANDFIRE program (Rollins 2009; [URL] to derive random presence and absence locations for the two <b>shrub</b> <b>community</b> types. This procedure simply provided an easy way to acquire a random sample of spatially accurate locations of the <b>shrub</b> <b>community</b> types at the same sampling intensity as the tree species.

40|$|Nitrous oxide (N(2) O) {{emission}} {{was measured}} in a Kobresia humilis meadow and a Potentilla fruticosa meadow in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau from June 2003 to July 2006. Five treatments were setup in the two alpine meadows. Two bare soil treatments were setup in the K. humilis meadow (BSK) and in the P. fruticosa meadow (BSP) by removing the above- and belowground plant biomass. Three plant community treatments were setup with one in the K. humilis meadow (herbaceous community in the K. humilis meadow-HCK) and two in the P. fruticosa meadow (herbaceous community in the P. fruticosa meadow-HCP, and <b>shrub</b> <b>community</b> in the P. fruticosa meadow-SCP). Nitrous oxide emission from BSP {{was estimated to be}} 38. 1 +/- 3. 6 mu g m(- 2) h(- 1), significantly higher than from BSK (30. 2 +/- 2. 8 mu g m(- 2) h(- 1)) during the whole experiment period. Rates from the two herbaceous blocks (HCK and HCP) were close to 39. 5 mu g m(- 2) stop h(- 1) during the whole experimental period whereas <b>shrub</b> <b>community</b> (SCP) showed significant high emission rates of N(2) O.
