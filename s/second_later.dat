5|$|Following his draft, Booth {{returned}} to Michigan State {{to complete his}} four-year tenure with the school. During his junior year, he and teammate Bryan Lerg set a Spartans record for the fastest two goals scored in a game (five seconds apart). Their goals came in a 6–5 overtime loss to the Alaska Nanooks in February 2005 and surpassed the previous record by one <b>second.</b> <b>Later</b> that month, Booth sustained a cracked rib and was sidelined for several games. He finished the 2004–05 season with 16 points (seven goals and nine assists) over 29 contests.|$|E

On 8 October at Richmond he won a sweepstakes of 20 guineas each, beating four rivals, with Boroughman finishing <b>second.</b> <b>Later</b> in the day Blacklock won the Dundas Stakes, beating Rasping, D.I.O and Shepard into second, third and fourth respectively.|$|E

5|$|Johnson was loaned {{out to the}} Belgian club Royal Antwerp in January 2004 {{where he}} made 11appearances, scoring five goals, {{including}} a 20-yard strike on his debut against Heusden-Zolder. In July 2004, he was sent on loan to Championship-side Coventry City for the 2004–05 season {{in order to gain}} first-team experience. He scored on his Coventry debut in a 2–0 victory against Sunderland on 7 August 2004, before he scored a <b>second</b> <b>later</b> that month in a 4–1 defeat of Nottingham Forest.

5|$|On 9 November 1901, George {{was created}} Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester. King Edward wished to prepare his son for his future role as king. In {{contrast}} to Edward himself, whom Queen Victoria had deliberately excluded from state affairs, George was given wide access to state documents by his father. George in turn allowed his wife {{access to his}} papers, as he valued her counsel and she often helped write her husband's speeches. As Prince of Wales, George supported reforms in naval training, including cadets being enrolled at the ages of twelve and thirteen, and receiving the same education, whatever their class and eventual assignments. The reforms were implemented by the then <b>Second</b> (<b>later</b> First) Sea Lord, Jacky Fisher.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight data}} {{recorder}} stopped recording at 22:25:40 AT (01:25:40 UTC), followed one <b>second</b> <b>later</b> by the cockpit voice recorder. The aircraft briefly appeared again on radar screens from 22:25:50 AT (01:25:50 UTC) to 22:26:04 AT (01:26:04 UTC). The last altitude recorded was 9,700 feet. According to the cockpit voice recorder, shortly after the first emergency declaration, the captain left his seat to fight the fire that was spreading {{to the rear of}} the cockpit; the Swissair volume of checklists was later found fused together in the wreckage, indicating that the captain may have attempted to use them to fan back the flames. The captain did not return to his seat; whether he was killed by the fire, asphyxiated by the smoke, or killed in the crash is not known. Flight data recording shows that engine two was shut down due to an engine fire approximately one minute before impact, implying that the first officer was still alive and continued trying to fly the aircraft until the final moments of the flight. At 22:31:18 AT (01:31:18 UTC), the aircraft struck the ocean at an estimated speed of 345mph (555km/h, 154m/s, or 299 knots) and with a force of the order of 350g, causing the aircraft to disintegrate instantly. The crash location was approximately , +/-300meters.|$|E

Those additions aimed to replenish a backfield depleted by the departure of Edgar Jones, Bill Boedeker, Les Horvath and Ara Parseghian. Ken Gorgal, a lanky safety from Purdue, was another draft pick who earned a starting role in his rookie year, supplanting long-time starter Cliff Lewis.|$|E

25|$|The {{grandson}} of Francis Pelham, 5th Earl of Chichester, Pelham was educated at Eton College where his right-arm medium-pace bowling was decisive in the 1930 Eton v Harrow cricket match: he took seven Harrow wickets for 21 runs in 21 overs {{in the first}} innings, and four for 23 in 21 overs and a ball in the <b>second.</b> <b>Later</b> that same season, he made his first-class cricket debut as a lower-order batsman and bowler for Sussex in the match against Yorkshire at Hove; his first and only wicket in the game was that of Herbert Sutcliffe, whom he caught and bowled, though Sutcliffe had scored 173 {{by the time that}} happened.|$|E
25|$|Several factors came {{together}} for Frazier in this fight. He was 27 {{years old and}} at his boxing peak physically and mentally, Ali, 29, was coming back from a three-year absence but had kept active. He had had two good wins, including a bruising battle with Oscar Bonavena, whom Ali had defeated by a TKO in 15 rounds. Frazier worked on strategy with coach Eddie Futch. They noted Ali's tendency to throw a right-hand uppercut from a straight standing position after dropping the hand in preparation to throw it with force. Futch instructed Frazier to watch Ali's right hand and, at the moment Ali dropped it, to throw a left hook {{at the spot where}} they knew Ali's face would be a <b>second</b> <b>later.</b> Frazier staggered Ali in the 11th round and knocked down Ali in the 15th in this way.|$|E

Another jiedushi of Hedong, Shi Jingtang, overthrew Later Tang to establish the third of the Five Dynasties, Later Jin, and yet another jiedushi of Hedong, Liu Zhiyuan, established the fourth of the Five Dynasties (Later Han) after the Khitans destroyed Later Jin, the third. Finally, when the fifth of the Five Dynasties (Later Zhou) emerged, the jiedushi of Hedong at the time, Liu Chong, rebelled and established an independent state called Northern Han, one of the Ten Kingdoms, in what is now northern and central Shanxi.|$|E
25|$|Gordon {{has participated}} in the Race of Champions three times, {{including}} a Nations Cup-winning drive with Team USA's Jimmie Johnson and Colin Edwards at the 2002 event in Gran Canaria. Prior to the ROC, Gordon competed in an ROC America event, losing to Kenny Bräck after crashing. Afterwards, Gordon defeated Johnson by one sixteen-hundredth of a <b>second.</b> <b>Later</b> in the day, Gordon rode with rally driver Marcus Grönholm around the course, both eventually flipping. In the ROC's first round, Gordon (2:03.03) lost to 2002 CART champion Cristiano da Matta, but in round two, Gordon (1:53.47) defeated Formula One's Fernando Alonso. In the semi-finals, Gordon (1:53.20) won against CART driver Sébastien Bourdais, and in the finals, Gordon (1:53.87) triumphed against European Touring Car Championship driver Fabrizio Giovanardi. He was slated to run it again in 2004 against seven-time F1 World Champion Michael Schumacher but was sidelined by the flu, and Casey Mears took his place. In 2005, Gordon competed in the Race of Champions event again, this time held in Paris, France, where he was partnered with motocross racer/X Games winner Travis Pastrana.|$|E
25|$|After a quiet 1944–45 season, {{in which}} Fazal took five wickets at 18.20, his {{performances}} the following season almost {{led to a}} place on the 1946 tour of England. Playing in the Zonal Quadrangular Tournament, a competition which acted as a trial for the tour, he opened the bowling for North Zone with Amarnath and took match figures of 9/83. Indian captain Nawab of Pataudi wanted Fazal in the squad but he was considered too young by the other selectors. On the tourists return home they played two matches against a Rest of India XI, Fazal took seven wickets in the first match which the Rest won but was expensive in the <b>second.</b> <b>Later</b> in the 1946–47 season his batting abilities were displayed when he scored his first and only first-class century. Playing for North Zone he scored exactly 100 not out from number eight, sharing in a 207-run seventh wicket partnership with Gogumal Kishenchand. North Zone won the match comfortably with Fazal contributing six wickets. He took a further five wickets in the final but North Zone lost by an innings. The zonal tournament had again acted as a trial, on this occasion for the country's inaugural tour of Australia in 1947–48. Fazal was included in the squad and attended the training camp, however before the tour began independence intervened and as a devout Muslim Fazal withdrew.|$|E
