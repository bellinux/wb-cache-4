50|$|Autosave {{is common}} in video games. Many video games have an {{autosave}} feature that saves progress during a session. For example, in an adventure game, it may autosave after completing a level or mission, or in fighting games, it might save after winning a match. Such points are called savepoints; sometimes the distinction from a checkpoint is blurred. Some games use autosave as the only method of saving data, and the player must complete a set amount of the game before saving takes place. Still another use of autosaving is as an anti-cheating device; for example in all MegaMan Battle Network games (except the first), the chip trader machines autosave upon giving out a new battle chip so the player can't cheat by <b>soft</b> <b>resetting</b> after each try of the chip trader until the desired chip is received.|$|R
5000|$|The DFS also {{supports}} {{a means to}} start up disc software based on a key sequence. If the shift key is held while the machine is <b>soft</b> or hard <b>reset,</b> the DFS checks drive 0 for a disc containing a positive boot flag. The boot flag is either 0 (ignore), 1 (load file), 2 (run machine code file) or 3 ("execute" [...] script). If the boot flag is positive, a file called [...] is looked for and loaded into memory (1), loaded and executed as machine code (2) or fed into the keyboard buffer (3). Option 3 reads [...] "EXEC" [...] files, text macro files used as primitive shell scripts. These are not true shell scripts but simply a series of keys to be typed, like a recording to play back. Thus, they cannot loop or branch unless they input such code into the BASIC interpreter. As well as being used during a reset, they can be executed at any time with the operating system's [...] command. EXEC files are file system independent.|$|R

50|$|Techniques such as flushed reset, pseudo-flash reset, and hard-to-soft reset combine {{soft and}} hard reset. The details {{of these methods}} differ, but the basic idea is the same. First, a hard reset is done, {{eliminating}} image lag. Next, a <b>soft</b> <b>reset</b> is done, causing a low noise reset without adding any lag. Pseudo-flash reset requires separating VRST from VDD, while the other two techniques add more complicated column circuitry. Specifically, pseudo-flash reset and hard-to-soft reset both add transistors between the pixel power supplies and the actual VDD. The result is lower headroom, without affecting fill factor.|$|E

50|$|Although {{some early}} systems had only 32 KB (32 √ó 1024 bytes) of RAM, most 480Zs were fitted {{with at least}} 64 KB of memory. Bank {{switching}} allowed memory to be extended to 128 KB on the main board, and up to 256 KB by using the option board (which also included the high resolution graphics hardware). As the Z80 processor could only directly address 64 KB without software support the additional memory was typically used as a RAM disk, specifically the Silicon Disk System. The silicon disk could be automatically loaded with software and data when the 480Z booted to the network. This saved considerable time in a classroom setting, where software could be loaded {{in advance of the}} children arriving. The silicon disc retained its contents if the system underwent a <b>soft</b> <b>reset.</b>|$|E
50|$|The user {{interface}} of the Nintendo DSi has been redesigned from the Nintendo DS and Nintendo DS Lite. The DSi's {{user interface}} is a slideable single row of icons. Moving between programs is fairly snappy, and most icons are big {{enough on the}} new touchscreen to allow for navigation using fingers instead of the built-in stylus. When users load the DSi for the first time, the system snaps a shot of their faces. Their faces then fill the entire top screen whenever {{they are in the}} main menu screen. From the main screen, they can take a picture at any time by pressing the shoulder buttons. The camera to be used can also be selected. From within programs, the power button doubles as a Home button, bringing them back to the main screen with a <b>soft</b> <b>reset.</b>|$|E
50|$|Other popular {{video game}} systems also {{have their own}} share of unique pirate multicarts. Unlike the Famicom, the Nintendo Game Boy multicarts {{have a variety of}} different, {{innovative}} multicart designs. Standard-sized Game Boy multicarts have either a game selection menu like the NES multicarts, or require quick toggling of the Game Boy power switch to select through games. Most of them incorporate an external <b>soft</b> <b>reset</b> button (not available on any original cart), so you can reset the game without powering off the system. To overcome the storage limitations of a standard-sized pirate cart, huge pirate carts were created. These unusually large and thick carts, more than two times the height and depth of a standard Game Boy cartridge, were able to store many of the larger new games, such as Donkey Kong Land easily. One drawback of these carts is they lack any battery backup, so saving games on these carts is impossible. Most of these carts were produced in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong.|$|E
5000|$|Probably {{the most}} {{well-known}} hacker and development tools for the Commodore 64 included [...] "Reset" [...] and [...] "Freezer" [...] cartridges. As the C64 had no built-in <b>soft</b> <b>reset</b> switch, reset cartridges were popular for entering game [...] "POKEs" [...] (codes which changed parts of a game's code in order to cheat) from popular Commodore computer magazines. Freezer cartridges had the capability to not only manually reset the machine, but also to dump {{the contents of the}} computer's memory and send the output to disk or tape. In addition, these cartridges had tools for editing game sprites, machine language monitors, floppy fast loaders, and other development tools. Freezer cartridges were not without controversy however. Despite containing many powerful tools for the programmer, they were also accused of aiding unauthorized distributors to defeat software copy protections. Perhaps the best known freezer cartridges were the Datel [...] "Action Replay", Evesham Micros Freeze Frame MK III B, Trilogic [...] "Expert", [...] "The Final Cartridge III", Super Snapshot and ICEPIC cartridges.|$|E
5000|$|Provided {{that the}} reset vector {{had not been}} {{occluded}} by an actively running program, invocation of [...] would interrupt a program and escape to the monitor or Applesoft command prompt. The use of [...] would force a reset {{at the expense of}} a small amount of memory corruption. Creative configuration of some soft switches at the monitor or at the prompt enabled immediate viewing of images from interrupted programs. Favorite scenes from games could be then recorded. On the Apple //e and //c, use of [...] would result in the pattern 0xA0A0 being written sparsely across all memory, including Hi-Res pages 1 and 2 at $2000 - $5FFF. Corruption by these artifacts could be edited out using a paint package. On the enhanced Apple //e, Hi-Res video memory could be preserved without artifact by the following sequence: pressing , and feathering the [...] key up then down for a fraction of a second, repeating until the self-diagnostic color pattern began to fill the first line of text in the upper left corner. Since the self-diagnostic progressed from $0000 upward, once the beginning address of text page 1 ($400) was clobbered, so then was the checksum of the reset vector ($3F4), which meant that a subsequent rapid press of [...] would force the firmware to reboot without clobbering memory above $0800 in either main or the auxiliary banks. It was possible to BSAVE these images to a floppy and create a slide show or a static image, because a <b>soft</b> <b>reset</b> did not clear the video memory on Hi-Res images.|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} CMOS APS pixel today {{consists of}} a photodetector (a pinned photodiode), a floating diffusion, a transfer gate, reset gate, selection gate and source-follower readout transistor‚Äîthe so-called 4T cell. The pinned photodiode was originally used in interline transfer CCDs due to its low dark current and good blue response, and when coupled with the transfer gate, allows complete charge transfer from the pinned photodiode to the floating diffusion (which is further connected to {{the gate of the}} read-out transistor) eliminating lag. The use of intrapixel charge transfer can offer lower noise by enabling the use of correlated double sampling (CDS). The Noble 3T pixel is still sometimes used since the fabrication requirements are easier. The 3T pixel comprises the same elements as the 4T pixel except the transfer gate and the photodiode. The reset transistor, Mrst, acts as a switch to reset the floating diffusion which acts in this case as the photodiode. When the reset transistor is turned on, the photodiode is effectively connected to the power supply, VRST, clearing all integrated charge. Since the reset transistor is n-type, the pixel operates in <b>soft</b> <b>reset.</b> The read-out transistor, Msf, acts as a buffer (specifically, a source follower), an amplifier which allows the pixel voltage to be observed without removing the accumulated charge. Its power supply, VDD, is typically tied to the power supply of the reset transistor. The select transistor, Msel, allows a single row of the pixel array to be read by the read-out electronics. Other innovations of the pixels such as 5T and 6T pixels also exist. By adding extra transistors, functions such as global shutter, as opposed to the more common rolling shutter, are possible. In order to increase the pixel densities, shared-row, four-ways and eight-ways shared read out, and other architectures can be employed. A variant of the 3T active pixel is the Foveon X3 sensor invented by Dick Merrill. In this device, three photodiodes are stacked {{on top of each other}} using planar fabrication techniques, each photodiode having its own 3T circuit. Each successive layer acts as a filter for the layer below it shifting the spectrum of absorbed light in successive layers. By deconvolving the response of each layered detector, red, green, and blue signals can be reconstructed.|$|E
40|$|To {{discuss the}} reset noise {{generated}} by slow subthreshold currents in image sensors, intuitive and simple analytical forms are derived, {{in spite of}} the subthreshold current nonlinearity. These solutions characterize the time evolution of the reset noise during the reset operation. With <b>soft</b> <b>reset,</b> the reset noise tends to m k T / 2 C P D when t ‚Üí ‚àû, in full agreement with previously published results. In this equation, C P D is the photodiode (PD) capacitance and m is a constant. The noise has an asymptotic time dependence of t ‚àí 1, even though the asymptotic time dependence of the average (deterministic) PD voltage is as slow as log t. The flush reset method is effective because the hard reset part eliminates image lag, and the <b>soft</b> <b>reset</b> part reduces the noise to <b>soft</b> <b>reset</b> level. The feedback reset with reverse taper control method shows both a fast convergence and a good reset noise reduction. When the feedback amplifier gain, A, is larger, even small value of capacitance, C P, between the input and output of the feedback amplifier will drastically decrease the reset noise. If the feedback is sufficiently fast, the reset noise limit when t ‚Üí ‚àû, becomes m k T (C P D + C P 1) 2 2 q 2 A (C P D + (1 + A) C P) {{in terms of the number}} of electron in the PD. According to this simple model, if CPD = 10 fF, CP/CPD = 0. 01, and A = 2700 are assumed, deep sub-electron rms reset noise is possible...|$|E

However, {{there are many different}} types of the memory controllers depending on the types of external memories, functional interface protocols, and implementation methodologies. In order to support the various memory controllers, we defined the latency of the memory controllers and classified them into three different categories: fixed latency, handshake, and both fixed latency, and handshake memory controllers. With these three models, we developed a general BIST architecture to support different types of memory controllers. During the Boundary-scan driven BIST operation in the board and the system-level test and diagnosis, system clock, system hard reset, <b>soft</b> <b>reset,</b> and other programmable features were considered carefully to make the BIST operate properly.
