5|$|The rise {{to power}} of the Nazi Party on 30 January 1933 gave German motor companies, notably Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union, an {{opportunity}} to return to motor racing. Having secured promises of funding shortly after the Nazis' {{rise to power}}, both companies <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> <b>better</b> part of 1933 developing their racing projects. Alfred Neubauer, the Mercedes racing manager, travelled to the Caracciolas' chalet in Lugano in November {{with a plan to}} sign him for the 1934 Grand Prix season if he was fit. Neubauer challenged Caracciola to walk, and although the driver laughed and smiled while he did so Neubauer was not fooled: Caracciola was not yet fit. Nevertheless, he offered him a contract, provided he prove his fitness in testing at the AVUS track early in the next year. Caracciola agreed and went to Stuttgart to sign the contract. The trip wore him out so much he spent much of his time lying on his hotel bed recuperating.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Maximizing the {{operational}} lifetime of a sensor network {{is a critical}} problem in practice. Many prior works define the network’s lifetime as the time before the first sensor in the network runs out of energy. However, when one sensor dies, {{the rest of the}} network can still work, as long as useful data generated by other sensors can reach the sink. More appropriately, we should maximize the lifetime vector of the network, consisting of the lifetimes of all sensors, sorted in ascending order. For this problem, there exists only a centralized algorithm that solves a series of linear programming problems with high-order complexities. This paper proposes a fully distributed progressive algorithm which iteratively produces a series of lifetime vectors, each <b>better</b> than <b>the</b> previous one. Instead of giving the optimal result in one shot after lengthy computation, the proposed distributed algorithm has a result at any time, and <b>the</b> more time <b>spent</b> gives <b>the</b> <b>better</b> result. We show that when the algorithm stabilizes, its result produces the maximum lifetime vector. Furthermore, simulations demonstrate that the algorithm is able to converge rapidly towards the maximum lifetime vector with low overhead. 1 I...|$|R
