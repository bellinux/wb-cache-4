It begins by highlighting issues that were being discussed in the 1990 s among the technology education community, and the efforts by the science and engineering communities to help shape the content of technology education. The efforts of the International Technology Education Association (ITEA) to create <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>technological</b> <b>literacy</b> in 2000 and supporting standards for assessment and professional development in 2003 are discussed. The recommendations from the report Technically Speaking and the impact it had in defining how a technologically literate person is characterized are also presented. This paper also examines the work of the National Center for Engineering and Technology Education (NCETE) from 2005 – 2012 in spearheading an understanding of how engineering design can be infused in schools, and also how students learn engineering design. The role of pre-engineering curricula in STEM education is examined, and the various curricula that are being used in technology education classrooms since the publication of the <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>Technological</b> <b>Literacy</b> are also traced. Finally, lessons that the Caribbean can learn from the recent evolution of technology education in the USA are discussed...|$|E

A team of teachers, 9 th-grade students, media specialists, and a researcher implemented a technological and information skills model across subject -area disciplines {{in an effort to}} identify the needed skills and implement an instructional program <b>for</b> <b>technological</b> <b>literacy.</b> The researcher worked with a formative and summative committee to design and produce a conceptual design, scope, sequence, and instructional schedule that served four grade levels across subject area curricula. Teachers used an interdisciplinary approach to instruction and determined that effective and efficient teaching <b>for</b> <b>technological</b> <b>literacy</b> across the curriculum was achieved. Students successfully demonstrated performance in 14 core competencies over a two-month time period during regular courses in five major disciplines. During the study, students benefited from opportunities to engage in supplemental technological activities by individual choice. Performance of technological objectives was marked and entered on checklists for planned future entry into a networked database for use by all teachers and administrators. Individual checklists were printed and became a part of student portfolios displaying technological learning. Other items in the portfolios included self-entry and exit-analyses and pre- and post-instruction compositions. Assessment instruments developed for the study were used to evaluate teacher attitudes, portfolio development, student attitudes, and class performance. Teachers and technology committee members judged the program to be successful and projected a need for implementation of the program for the entire school population. Findings and recommendations showed that cross-discipline instruction based on the model used in the study was a solution for increasing student levels literacy through increased understandings and demonstrated performance.

40|$|Technology {{education}} {{and many other}} fields are placing increased emphasis on problem solving. The <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>Technological</b> <b>Literacy</b> (STL) state that “Problem solving is basic to technology ” (ITEA, 2000, p. 90). Jonassen (2000, p. 63) contends that “most psychologists and educators regard problem solving {{as the most important}} learning outcome for life. ” “Problem solving is a critical process skill that involves virtually all aspects of existence ” (Wu, Custer, & Dyrenfurth, 1996, p. 56). “Virtually everyone, in their everyday and professional lives, regularly solves problems ” (Jonassen, 2000, p. 63). All problems are not the same and must be approached differently than rote or component skills (Westberry, 2003).

40|$|The {{technological}} literacy of students has recently {{become one of}} the primary goals of education in countries such as the USA, England, New Zealand, Australia, and so forth. However the question here is whether these educations – their long-term policy documents as well as the standards they provide in particular – address sufficient learning about the nature of technology. This seems to be an important concern that through taking advantage of the philosophy of technology (the arena which affords a bountiful ground of various reflections on the nature of technology) is intended to be discussed throughout this study. In the first place, the paper presents a relevant framework based upon Mitcham’s (1994) four-aspect account of technology, i. e., technology as objects, knowledge, activities, and volition. Then it categorizes the main relevant concepts and concerns put forward by many other philosophers of technology into this framework; this will yield a concrete model (tool) to analyze any intended standard such as the above mentioned ones.

A recent survey (Reeve, Nielson, 2 ̆ 6 amp; Meade, 2003) revealed that in Utah, a majority of teachers have a copy of the standards and are supportive of them, but they want help implementing standards-based technology education in their classrooms. Initially, a self-evaluation of the teacher education program was conducted that included input from students, local teachers, state and district leaders, and an external consultant with expertise in technology teacher education programs. University technology teacher education students could be change agents by bringing ideas into the classrooms of our local technology teachers, allowing them to experience more than just a quick workshop fix for incorporating the standards.

40|$|Much of the {{national}} attention on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education tends to concentrate on science and mathematics, {{with its emphasis on}} standardized test scores. However as the National Academy of Engineering Committee on K- 12 Engineering Education stressed, engineering can {{contribute to the development of}} an effective and interconnected STEM education system (Katehi, Pearson, 2 ̆ 6 Feder, 2009). In addition, engineering can provide authentic learning contexts for science, technology, and mathematics. Numerous K- 12 engineering initiatives have emerged across the U. S. developing curriculum and conducting teacher professional development (Brophy, Klein, Portsmore, 2 ̆ 6 Rogers, 2008). The focus of pre-college engineering education has largely been on process, with engineering content or concepts playing at best a secondary role. The <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>Technological</b> <b>Literacy</b> (STL) (2000), for example, has been cited by many as providing direction for pre-college engineering, with its design-oriented standards. However, the STL do not specify engineering content and focuses only on the design process.

However, these studies have resulted in lists that focus heavily on process and the interpersonal skills associated with engineering (communication, teamwork, etc.).

The idea of “doing ” craft may simply suggest that execution is more important than expression. For example, Clyde Jones, a North Carolinian folk artist, litters his front lawn with assorted animals he creates from logs. This yard artist, unschooled in the practices of fine woodworking, uses a chainsaw to shape the figures he crafts.

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a growing {{interest}} in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education across the K- 16 spectrum. While much of this interest has concentrated on science and mathematics, technology and engineering are emerging as authentic educational problem solving contexts, as well as disciplines in their own right at the K- 12 level. Over the past 20 years, the technology education field has concentrated on defining and implementing a set of content standards, the <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>Technological</b> <b>Literacy</b> (ITEA, 2000) (STL), with mixed results. On a national scale, the field continues to evolve from its historical industrial arts base toward more contemporary approaches to curriculum and pedagogy. In spite of the STL, which were designed to define the content base for technology education, practice continues to be driven by projects and activities with little focus on specific student learning outcomes. In addition, over the past decade, the field has shifted toward an interest in an alignment with engineering. Corresponding with technology education‟s shift in emphasis has been the engineering profession‟s emerging interest in K- 12 education. A significant part of this emphasis can be attributed to a concern among engineering educators that insufficient numbers of students, including women and minorities, are being attracted into and prepared for post-secondary engineering education. More positively, there is a growing awareness that a well crafted engineering presence within the K- 12 curriculum provides a rich and authentic contextual base for mathematics and science concepts. Engineering-oriented programs, particularly at the secondary level, range from those designed to promote general engineering/technological literacy (designed for all students) to those designed to prepare students for post-secondary engineering education...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{established the}} essential equipment, tools, {{hardware and software}} needed to teach a contemporary standards-based Technology Education program {{at the high school}} level with one teacher. A three round Delphi study established what a contemporary Technology Education lab should ideally include utilizing the expert opinion of teachers in the field, teacher educators and administrators with direct roles in program development. The research also suggests types of activities which could be utilized in such a facility. Equipping a facility with these essential items could assist teachers in preparing students to become technologically literate, by addressing all of the <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>Technological</b> <b>Literacy</b> to include engineering and design concepts. Most Americans believe all citizens should be technologically literate and should have adequate facilities to accomplish that goal (Rose, Gallup, Dugger and Starkweather, 2004). Shields and Harris (2007) indicated Technology Education facilities and components have been less defined over the past 26 years creating confusion when identifying Technology Education facilities and programs. The panel of experts chosen for this Delphi study established three categories: essential items, moderately important items and non-essential items. The panel identified equipment, tools, hardware and software needed to equip a contemporary Technology Education facility giving the teacher laboratory capabilities to teach a standards based curriculum. Such a facility might provide a setting in which high school students could graduate with a basic understanding of technology; how to assess, use and manage technology in a facility with similar tools, equipment, hardware, and software; or in other words, achieve technological literacy (ITEA, 2000).

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of teachers has {{been regarded as}} crucial {{to the success of}} standards-based reform (Fishman, Marx, Best, 2 ̆ 6 Tal, 2003). Research, particularly within science and mathematics, has underscored the need for professional development to help teachers understand (a) subject matter, (b) learners and learning, and (c) teaching methods (Loucks-Horsley, 1999). In addition to focusing on teacher professional development, national reform efforts have also emphasized science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education (i. e., Rising Above the Gathering Storm, NRC, 2006). While substantial work has been conducted in mathematics and science, the efforts in technology and engineering education are much less mature. This makes sense given the relatively recent development of the <b>Standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>Technological</b> <b>Literacy</b> (ITEA, 2000) and recent calls for integrating engineering into the K- 12 classroom as both an avenue to technological literacy and as a way to enhance the engineering pipeline (Erekson 2 ̆ 6 Custer, 2008; Lewis, 2005; Wicklein, 2006). The complexity of engineering and its integration into K- 12 education, however, have resulted in a variety of issues requiring sustained empirical research (Johnson, Burghardt, 2 ̆ 6 Daugherty, 2008). One particular area of need given the emphasis on teacher effects on student learning is to research engineering-oriented teacher professional development. A lack of publication on the effective practices of engineering-specific professional development projects makes a study investigating mature efforts necessary. Thus, the purpose of this qualitative study was to explore professional development elements for secondary school engineering education. The research questions that guided this study were: 1. What are the primary design elements used to deliver engineering-oriented professional development (logistics, format, activities, instructors, and instructional strategies) and why were these elements selected?+ 2. How do the projects define and evaluate effectiveness? The focus on the professional development design decisions and determinations of effectiveness for secondary school engineering education are particularly important because they are the elements that “designers of professional development have immediate control over and can modify in order to increase their impact on teachers’ knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes, and subsequent enactment” (Fishman et al., 2003, p. 646). Each design decision is typically connected to a distinct purpose and level of impact (Speck 2 ̆ 6 Knipe, 2005). By understanding the design decisions of specific projects, the connection to secondary school engineering and its impact on teaching and student learning can be better understood...|$|E

Culture is the " [...] . {{conventional}} patterns of thought, activity and artefact that are passed on {{from generation to}} generation in a manner generally assumed to involve learning [...] . " (Brown, 1991) Current frameworks for describing the processes of technology tend to be from the viewpoint of a 'technologist'. Within these frameworks, the philosophy that underpins the analysis of technology derives from the sciences and engineering. Technological criteria are used to question and judge the role of technology in human affairs. Views today on {{what it means to be}} 'technologically literate' rest on such technical frameworks. A major drawback is the emphasis placed on the distinctions between society and technology; representations do not necessarily show what influences the 'effect' of technology on the society in which it is situated. We need to look behind the 'processes' which drive technological innovation, accumulation, diffusion and adjustment in a society. This paper outlines an ethnographic study currently looking at how culture and personality affect cognition and values in the way certain social groups construct their interpretation of technology. The implications of these findings <b>for</b> educating <b>for</b> <b>technological</b> <b>literacy</b> will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, new law {{courses are}} not {{approved}} unless both the "needs analysis" is convincing and the "consumer demand" is certain. Needs and demands today {{are driven by}} new pressures <b>for</b> <b>technological</b> <b>literacy</b> accelerated by globalisation and the current revolution in {{information and communication technologies}} (ICTs). The popular logic is that new global "knowledge economies" need "knowledge workers" or "wired workers" to labour in the new e-markets for goods and services and to use the burgeoning number and high quality of electronic information databases now essential to legal research. Students are acutely aware of these developments {{as well as of the}} highly competitive nature of the contemporary labour market for law graduates. Consequently, students are demanding more "how to" research skills training. This article puts in context the reasons why, at the University of Waikato, we regard creating synergy between critical and <b>technological</b> <b>literacy</b> as essential <b>for</b> teaching and learning law-in-context research methods, and then describes the curriculum we designed for a legal research methods course in order to trial this approach. From the start we have been clear that the new course was not just to be a "how to" course, and that we would be concentrating on critical literacy as much as <b>technological</b> <b>literacy.</b> <b>For</b> us, critical literacy is fundamental because it relates to the way in which one analyses the world, a process described as "becoming aware of the underlying structure of conceptions". 1 This awareness includes the politics in the architectures that constitute the Internet and the assembly of information accessible on it. We designed our curriculum for critical literacy around five types of analysis. Our shorthand for this is to call these "the five 'Cs'". Our five interrelated categories for analysis focus on: Change - in society, economy and culture Concepts - legal and sociological concepts and analytical frameworks Critique (and standpoint or perspective) Comparisons (and Contrasts) Contexts. We argue that, at a minimum, these are the conceptual tools necessary to critique and engage the operation of the law in the context of society, noting especially inequalities and injustices. Throughout the course students are encouraged to harness <b>technological</b> <b>literacy</b> to each dimension of their analysis. This article consists of two main parts. The first part ("Context and Assumptions") explores in some depth the reasons for the need to teach critical <b>literacy</b> alongside <b>technological</b> <b>literacy.</b> The second part ("The Legal Research Methods Course") describes our efforts to promote the synergy between critical and <b>technological</b> <b>literacies</b> in the context of a fourth year optional course, Legal Research Methods 2000, at the University of Waikato School of Law...|$|R

A communication portal has become universal solution in all cases from common communication between persons or information and data interchange up to e-business. For the creation of quality portal for information interchange of sensitive character, it is necessary to know standards dedicated to this purpose. The main requirement for these platforms is document and data interchange, what presumes usage of well-known and attested standards. Using the portal also imposes trust of users. One way of building the trust in a platform is usage of accepted standards. In this paper we concentrate on two groups of <b>standards</b> – <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> <b>technological</b> data and information exchange and <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> interchange security...|$|R
