5|$|Control over {{propaganda}} {{is another}} matter. When forming his argument here, Russell specifically targets the doctrines of John Stuart Mill. Russell argues that Mill's {{argument for the}} freedom of speech is too weak, so long as it is balanced against the harm principle; for any speech worth protecting for political reasons is likely to cause <b>somebody</b> harm. For example, the citizen ought {{to have the opportunity to}} impeach malicious governors, but that would surely harm the governor, at the very least (Russell 1938:179).|$|E
5|$|Development on Infamous 2 began {{immediately}} after Sucker Punch finished the first Infamous, led by returning game director Nate Fox.

The original voice actor for Cole was replaced by Eric Ladin as Sucker Punch wanted <b>somebody</b> who could perform Cole's physical reactions with motion capture, a new addition to the series.|$|E

5|$|I needed <b>somebody</b> {{who could}} perform, and {{who also had}} a lot of endurance, because we were {{shooting}} in Atlanta at the end of July. Silicone doesn’t have cell structure, like foam does. It doesn’t breathe. So Brian was basically encased in a sixty-pound wet-suit. Every part of his body was covered. He had facial prosthetics, hands, full legs, feet. It was all glued down. It wasn’t like we could take him out between takes. He was in.|$|E
5|$|I {{remember}} {{most of the}} video you had shot with the crane, some Steadicam, plus some panning.

I like the steadiness of the performance because then you can really enjoy the movement of the body. You see the skill.|$|E

OnTilt jewelers decided that the 2010 bracelet design {{would return to the}} tradition of the 1970s and 1980s where the bracelet was a heavy piece of unadorned metal. American jewelry designer Steve Soffa was chosen to design and manufacture the entire set of bracelets. The goal was to create a bracelet that <b>somebody</b> would actually want to wear every day. In 2011, OnTilt has also been chosen to manufacture the WSOP Circuit rings.|$|E

By the end of 1960, after going 8–13, Koufax was {{thinking}} about quitting baseball to devote himself to an electronics business that he'd invested in. After the last game of the season, he threw his gloves and spikes into the trash. Nobe Kawano, the clubhouse supervisor, retrieved the equipment to return to Koufax the following year (or to <b>somebody</b> else if Koufax {{did not return to}} play).|$|E

Claire visits a psychic (Nick Jameson) who warns her of a dangerous future for her unborn child if she does not raise it. In the present, Claire experiences terrifying nightmares and begins to suspect that <b>somebody</b> is trying to harm her unborn child. In response, Hurley (Jorge Garcia) decides to start a census of all of the survivors.|$|E

5000|$|However, Henley {{said that}} Felder had {{continued}} to engage in legal actions, unspecified by Henley, against them. Henley saw History of the Eagles as being instructive on how bands need leaders and cannot work as a democracy. Henley reiterated a point made by Frey in the documentary: [...] "The thing about bands {{is you have to}} have leaders in a band. Everybody can’t be on equal footing. It’s like a football team. <b>Somebody's</b> got to be the quarterback. <b>Somebody’s</b> got to snap the ball, <b>somebody's</b> got to run with the ball, <b>somebody's</b> got to block. If people play their positions and play their strengths everything turns out well. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts.

5|$|It is poetic {{justice that}} a {{helicopter}} {{is now at}} the heart of the Government's embarrassment and in the centre of their dilemma. Indeed, it was hard to blame the prison officer who observed that he thought it was the Minister for Defence paying an informal visit to Mountjoy Prison yesterday because, of course, we all know the Minister for Defence is wont to use helicopters, as <b>somebody</b> observed already, as other Ministers are wont to use State cars.|$|E
5|$|It's about obsession, {{and that}} can be scary because you're not in control and you don't know where it's going to stop. It says that, at any point in somebody's life, when they loved <b>somebody</b> {{strongly}} enough and that person returns, a certain touch, a certain physical gesture can turn them from being defiant and disgusted with this person to being subservient again. And it's not just a pleasurable feeling that comes back, it's the complete terror and loss of control that comes back. And I think that's ultimately a great weapon.|$|E
5|$|Kikai {{had started}} his Asakusa series of square, {{monochrome}} portraits {{as early as}} 1973, but after this there was a hiatus until 1985, {{when he realized that}} an ideal backdrop would be the plain red walls of Sensō-ji. At that time, the great majority of his Asakusa portraits adopted further constraints: the single subject stands {{directly in front of the}} camera (originally a Minolta Autocord TLR, later the Hasselblad), looking directly at it, and is shown from around the knees upwards. Kikai may wait at the temple for four or five hours, hoping to see <b>somebody</b> he wants to photograph, and three or four days may pass without a single photograph; but he may photograph three people in a single day, and he has photographed over six hundred people in this way. He believes that to have a plain backdrop and a direct confrontation with the subject allows the viewer to see the subject as a whole, and as <b>somebody</b> on whom time is marked, without any distracting or limiting specificity.|$|E
