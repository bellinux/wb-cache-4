5|$|Throughout the world, hawksbill <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> {{are taken}} by humans, {{though it is}} illegal to hunt them in many countries. In some parts of the world, hawksbill <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> are eaten as a delicacy. As far back as the fifth century BC, <b>sea</b> <b>turtles,</b> {{including}} the hawksbill, were eaten as delicacies in China.|$|E
5|$|While the hawksbill <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> mainly feed on sponges {{found on}} coral reefs, they also feed on crustaceans, algae, and fish. They are prey to large fish, sharks, and humans. The hawksbill <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> are {{endangered}} mainly due to human impact. These <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> mainly {{stay close to}} shorelines as this is where sponge-bearing coral reefs can be found, as well as beaches that provide nesting sites.|$|E

25|$|Despite recent {{declines in}} the <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> populations, five species are known to nest in Burma at well known island and {{mainland}} beaches known as turtle-banks. These are the olive ridley <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> (Lepidochelys olivacea), the loggerhead <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> (Caretta caretta), the green <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> (Chelonia mydas), the hawksbill <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> (Eretmochelys imbricata), and the leatherback <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> (Dermochelys coriacea).|$|R

50|$|Cheloniidae is {{a family}} of {{typically}} large marine turtles that are characterized by their common traits such as, having a flat streamlined wide and rounded shell that has have almost paddle-like flippers for their forelimbs 1. The six species that make up this family are; the Green <b>Sea</b> <b>Turtle,</b> Loggerhead <b>Sea</b> <b>Turtle,</b> Olive Ridley <b>Sea</b> <b>Turtle,</b> Hawksbill <b>Sea</b> <b>Turtle,</b> Flatback <b>Sea</b> <b>Turtle,</b> and the Kemp's Ridley <b>Sea</b> <b>Turtle.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{tiger shark}} is an apex {{predator}} {{and has a}} reputation for eating anything. These predators swim close inland to eat at night, and during the day swim out into deeper waters. Young tiger sharks are found to feed largely on small fish, as well as various small jellyfish, cephalopods, and other mollusks. Around the time they attain , or near sexual maturity, their selection expands considerably, and much larger animals become regular prey. Numerous fish, crustaceans, sea birds, sea snakes, marine mammals (e.g. bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops), common dolphins (Delphinus), spotted dolphins (Stenella), dugongs (Dugong dugon), seals and sea lions, and <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> (including the three largest species: the leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), the loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and the green <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> (Chelonia mydas),) are regularly eaten by adult tiger sharks. In fact, adult <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> have been found in up to 20.8% of studied tiger shark stomachs, indicating somewhat of a dietary preference for <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> where they are commonly encountered. They also eat other sharks (including adult sandbar sharks (Carcharhinus plumbeus)), as well as rays, and sometimes even other tiger sharks.|$|E
5|$|Within the <b>sea</b> <b>turtles,</b> E. imbricata {{has several}} unique {{anatomical}} and ecological traits. It {{is the only}} primarily spongivorous reptile. Because of this, its evolutionary position is somewhat unclear. Molecular analyses support placement of Eretmochelys within the taxonomic tribe Carettini, which includes the carnivorous loggerhead and ridley <b>sea</b> <b>turtles,</b> {{rather than in the}} tribe Chelonini, which includes the herbivorous green turtle. The hawksbill probably evolved from carnivorous ancestors.|$|E
5|$|Adult hawksbill <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> are {{primarily}} found in tropical coral reefs. They are usually seen resting in caves and ledges {{in and around}} these reefs throughout the day. As a highly migratory species, they inhabit {{a wide range of}} habitats, from the open ocean to lagoons and even mangrove swamps in estuaries. Little is known about the habitat preferences of early life-stage E. imbricata; like other young <b>sea</b> <b>turtles,</b> they are assumed to be completely pelagic, remaining at sea until they mature.|$|E
50|$|Kemp's ridley <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> (Lepidochelys kempii), or the Atlantic ridley <b>sea</b> <b>turtle,</b> is {{the rarest}} species of <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> and is {{critically}} endangered. It {{is one of}} two living species in the genus Lepidochelys (the other one being L. olivacea, the olive ridley <b>sea</b> <b>turtle).</b>|$|R
25|$|The Río de la Plata is {{a habitat}} for the loggerhead <b>sea</b> <b>turtle,</b> green <b>sea</b> <b>turtle,</b> {{leatherback}} <b>sea</b> <b>turtle,</b> the rare La Plata dolphin, and {{many species of}} fish.|$|R
50|$|Beach towns, such as Tortuguero, Costa Rica, have transitioned from a tourism {{industry}} that made profits from selling <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> meat and shells to an ecotourism-based economy. Tortuguero {{is considered to}} be the founding location of <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> conservation. In the 1960s the cultural demand for <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> meat, shells, and eggs was quickly killing the once abundant <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> populations that nested on the beach. The Caribbean Conservation Corporation began working with villagers to promote ecotourism as a permanent substitute to <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> hunting. <b>Sea</b> <b>turtle</b> nesting grounds became sustainable. Tourists love to come and visit the nesting grounds, although it causes a lot of stress to the turtles because all of the eggs can get damaged or harmed. Since the creation of a <b>sea</b> <b>turtle,</b> ecotourism-based economy, Tortugero annually houses thousands of tourists who visit the protected 22 mi beach that hosts <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> walks and nesting grounds.|$|R
5|$|Although {{evidence}} is lacking, modern <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> probably descended {{from a single}} common ancestor during the Cretaceous period. Like all other <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> except the leatherback, loggerheads {{are members of the}} ancient family Cheloniidae, and appeared about 40 million years ago. Of the six species of living Cheloniidae, loggerheads are more closely related to the Kemp's ridley sea turtle, olive ridley sea turtle, and the hawksbill turtle than they are to the flatback turtle and the green turtle.|$|E
5|$|The Hilton Head Island area {{is home to}} a {{vast array}} of wildlife, {{including}} alligators, deer, loggerhead <b>sea</b> <b>turtles,</b> manatees, hundreds of species of birds, and dolphins.|$|E
5|$|Consensus has {{determined}} <b>sea</b> <b>turtles,</b> including E. imbricata to be, {{at the very}} least, threatened species because of their slow growth and maturity, and slow reproductive rates. Many adult turtles {{have been killed by}} humans, both accidentally and deliberately. Their existence is threatened due to pollution and loss of nesting areas because of coastal development. Biologist guess that the hawkbill population has declined 80 percent in the past hundred years. Human and animal encroachment threatens nesting sites, and small mammals dig up the eggs to eat. In the US Virgin Islands, mongooses raid hawksbill nests (along with those of other <b>sea</b> <b>turtles,</b> such as Dermochelys coriacea) right after they are laid.|$|E
2500|$|There are a {{total of}} 5 {{different}} species of marine turtle that are sighted periodically in the islands, {{the most common of}} these being the endangered loggerhead <b>sea</b> <b>turtle.</b> The other four are the green <b>sea</b> <b>turtle,</b> hawksbill <b>sea</b> <b>turtle,</b> leatherback <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> and Kemp's ridley <b>sea</b> <b>turtle.</b> Currently, there are no signs that any of these species breed in the islands, and so those seen in the water are usually [...] However, it is believed that some of these species may have bred in the islands in the past, and there are records of several sightings of leatherback <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> on beaches in Fuerteventura, adding credibility to the theory.|$|R

5|$|Hawksbill <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> {{have a wide}} range, found {{predominantly}} {{in tropical}} reefs of the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans. Of all the sea turtle species, E. imbricata is the one most associated with warm tropical waters. Two major subpopulations are known, in the Atlantic and Indo-Pacific.|$|E
5|$|Loggerhead <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> are {{classified}} as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and are listed under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, making international trade illegal. In the United States, the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service classify them as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. Loggerheads are listed as endangered under both Australia's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and Queensland's Nature Conservation Act 1992. The Convention on Migratory Species works {{for the conservation of}} loggerhead <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> on the Atlantic coast of Africa, {{as well as in the}} Indian Ocean and southeast Asia. Throughout Japan, the Sea Turtle Association of Japan aids in the conservation of loggerhead <b>sea</b> <b>turtles.</b> Greece's ARCHELON works for their conservation. The Marine Research Foundation works for loggerhead conservation in Oman. Annex 2 of the Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife Protocol of the Cartagena Convention, which deals with pollution that could harm marine ecosystems, also protects them. Conservation organizations worldwide have worked with the shrimp trawling industry to develop turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) to exclude even the largest turtles. TEDs are mandatory for all shrimp trawlers.|$|E
5|$|The {{biodiversity}} {{of local}} oceanic fauna {{is not well}} understood. <b>Sea</b> <b>turtles</b> and mammals, including monk seals, fin whales (only 1 sighting and 5 strandings have been documented in Turkish waters), and dolphins are considered to reside in the park area, although regularity of occurrences are unclear.|$|E
50|$|Fisheries {{often use}} {{large-scale}} nets that are indiscriminate and catch whatever comes along; <b>sea</b> <b>turtle,</b> dolphin, or shark. Bycatch {{is a large}} contributor to <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> deaths. Longline, trawl, and gillnet fishing are three types of fishing with the most <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> accidents. Deaths occur often because of drowning, where the <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> was ensnared and could not come up for air.|$|R

50|$|The Guianan-Amazon Mangroves support {{very diverse}} populations {{of fish and}} migratory birds, {{as well as other}} wildlife.Typical species of fauna include scarlet ibis (Eudocimus ruber), American {{flamingo}} (Phoenicopterus ruber), magnificent frigatebird (Fregata magnificens), loggerhead <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> (Caretta caretta), hawksbill <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> (Eretmochelys imbricata), green <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> (Chelonia mydas), leatherback <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> (Dermochelys coriacea), West Indian manatee (Trichechus manatus), American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus), and giant otter (Pteronura brasiliensis).|$|R
5|$|The {{fresh water}} {{entering}} Florida Bay from the Everglades creates ideal conditions for vast beds of turtle grass and algae formations that foster animal {{life in the}} bay. <b>Sea</b> <b>turtles</b> and manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) eat the grass, while invertebrates such as worms, clams, and other mollusks consume algae formations and microscopic plankton. Female <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> return annually to nest on the shore, and manatees spend the winter months in the warmer water of the bay. The Calusa Indians had various uses for shells of marine invertebrates, {{due to the lack}} of dense rock with which to make tools. They used the horse conch (Pleuroploca gigantea), left-handed whelk (Busycon contrarium), and the Florida crown conch (Melongena corona) as drinking vessels, picks, hammers, knives and awls.|$|E
5|$|The species (along {{with the}} entire family Cheloniidae) has been listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. It is illegal to import or export turtle products, or to kill, capture, or harass hawksbill <b>sea</b> <b>turtles.</b>|$|E
5|$|Biscayne National Park protects four {{distinct}} ecosystems: {{the shoreline}} mangrove swamp, the shallow waters of Biscayne Bay, the coral limestone keys and the offshore Florida Reef. The shoreline swamps {{of the mainland}} and island margins provide a nursery for larval and juvenile fish, molluscs and crustaceans. The bay waters harbor immature and adult fish, seagrass beds, sponges, soft corals, and manatees. The keys are covered with tropical vegetation including endangered cacti and palms, and their beaches provide nesting grounds for endangered <b>sea</b> <b>turtles.</b> Offshore reefs and waters harbor more than 200 species of fish, pelagic birds, whales and hard corals. Sixteen endangered species including Schaus' swallowtail butterflies, smalltooth sawfish, manatees, and green and hawksbill <b>sea</b> <b>turtles</b> may be observed in the park. Biscayne also has a small population of threatened American crocodiles and a few American alligators.|$|E
50|$|Other tales {{tell that}} the Bakunawa has a sister {{in the form of}} a <b>sea</b> <b>turtle.</b> The <b>sea</b> <b>turtle</b> would visit a certain island in the Philippines in order to lay its eggs.

5|$|Hawksbills evidently reach {{maturity}} after 20 years. Their lifespan is unknown. Like other <b>sea</b> <b>turtles,</b> hawksbills are solitary {{for most}} of their lives; they meet only to mate. They are highly migratory. Because of their tough carapaces, adults' only predators are sharks, estuarine crocodiles, octopuses, and some species of pelagic fish.|$|E
5|$|<b>Sea</b> <b>turtles</b> are {{protected}} by law in Costa Rica, but poaching remains common. Locals take eggs, which {{are believed to be}} an aphrodisiac, and sell them on the black market.
