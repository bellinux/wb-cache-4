5|$|Primary {{transcript}} RNAs {{are often}} modified by enzymes after transcription. For example, a poly(A) tail and a 5' cap {{are added to}} eukaryotic pre-mRNA and introns are removed by the <b>spliceosome.</b>|$|E
5|$|RNA splicing, {{carried out}} by a complex called the <b>spliceosome,</b> is {{the process by which}} introns, or regions of DNA that do not code for protein, are removed from the pre-mRNA and the {{remaining}} exons connected to re-form a single continuous molecule. This process normally occurs after 5' capping and 3' polyadenylation but can begin before synthesis is complete in transcripts with many exons. Many pre-mRNAs, including those encoding antibodies, can be spliced in multiple ways to produce different mature mRNAs that encode different protein sequences. This process is known as alternative splicing, and allows production of a large variety of proteins from a limited amount of DNA.|$|E
25|$|Galectin-1 and galectin-3 {{have been}} found, surprisingly, to {{associate}} with nuclear ribonucleoprotein complexes including the <b>spliceosome.</b> Studies revealed that galectin-1 and -3 are required splicing factors, since removal of the galectins by affinity chromatography with lactose resulted in loss of splicing activity. It appears that the splicing capability of galectins is independent of their sugar-binding specificities. Site-directed mutagenesis studies to the carbohydrate recognition domain removes glycan binding but does not prevent association with the <b>spliceosome.</b>|$|E
40|$|Nuclear pre-mRNA {{splicing}} in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as {{in higher}} eukaryotes, occurs in large RNA-protein complexes called <b>spliceosomes.</b> The small nuclear RNA components, U 1, U 2, U 4, U 5, and U 6, have been extensively studied; however, {{very little is}} known about the protein components of yeast <b>spliceosomes.</b> Here we use antibodies against the precursor RNA processing protein PRP 8, a protein component of the U 5 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle, to detect its association with <b>spliceosomes</b> throughout the splicing reaction and in a post-splicing complex containing the excised intron. In addition, an indirect immunological approach has been developed that confirms the presence of precursor RNA processing protein PRP 8 in isolated <b>spliceosomes.</b> This method has possible general application for the analysis of ribonucleoprotein particle complexes...|$|R

25|$|Splicing of mRNA is {{performed}} by an RNA and protein complex {{known as the}} <b>spliceosome,</b> containing snRNPs designated U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 (U3 {{is not involved in}} mRNA splicing). U1 binds to the 5' GU and U2, {{with the assistance of the}} U2AF protein factors, binds to the branchpoint A within the branch site. The complex at this stage is known as the <b>spliceosome</b> A complex. Formation of the A complex is usually the key step in determining the ends of the intron to be spliced out, and defining the ends of the exon to be retained. (The U nomenclature derives from their high uridine content).|$|E
25|$|At {{least five}} {{different}} kinds of snRNPs join the <b>spliceosome</b> to participate in splicing. They can be visualized by gel electrophoresis and are known individually as: U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6. Their snRNA components are known, respectively, as: U1 snRNA, U2 snRNA, U4 snRNA, U5 snRNA, and U6 snRNA.|$|E
25|$|The {{carboxy-terminal domain}} (CTD) of RNA {{polymerase}} II is {{that portion of}} the polymerase that is involved in the initiation of DNA transcription, the capping of the RNA transcript, and attachment to the <b>spliceosome</b> for RNA splicing. The CTD typically consists of up to 52 repeats of the sequence Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser. The carboxy-terminal repeat domain (CTD) is essential for life. Cells containing only RNAPII with none or only up to one-third of its repeats are inviable.|$|E

25|$|This {{mechanism}} {{is an example}} of exon definition in splicing. A <b>spliceosome</b> assembles on an intron, and the snRNP subunits fold the RNA so that the 5' and 3' ends of the intron are joined. However, recently studied examples such as this one show that there are also interactions between the ends of the exon. In this particular case, these exon definition interactions are necessary to allow the binding of core splicing factors prior to assembly of the spliceosomes on the two flanking introns.|$|E
25|$|An archaic form of {{splicing}} {{preserved in}} Zebrafish {{is known to}} use microsatellite sequences within intronic mRNA {{for the removal of}} introns in the absence of U2AF2 and other splicing machinery. It is theorized that these sequences form highly stable cloverleaf configurations that bring the 3' and 5' intron splice sites into close proximity, effectively replacing the <b>spliceosome.</b> This method of RNA splicing is believed to have diverged from human evolution at the formation of tetrapods and to represent an artifact of an RNA world.|$|E
25|$|A very {{important}} modification of eukaryotic pre-mRNA is RNA splicing. The majority of eukaryotic pre-mRNAs consist of alternating segments called exons and introns. During {{the process of}} splicing, an RNA-protein catalytical complex known as <b>spliceosome</b> catalyzes two transesterification reactions, which remove an intron and release it in form of lariat structure, and then splice neighbouring exons together. In certain cases, some introns or exons can be either removed or retained in mature mRNA. This so-called alternative splicing creates series of different transcripts originating from a single gene. Because these transcripts can be potentially translated into different proteins, splicing extends the complexity of eukaryotic gene expression.|$|E
40|$|This study {{reports the}} cloning, sequencing, and {{development}} of antisera against the human U 5 snRNP 220 -kDa protein or hPrp 8 p. Prp 8 p is the most highly conserved large nuclear protein known to date, {{but it is not}} related to any other protein. Southern, Northern, and expressed sequence tag analyses indicate that hPrp 8 p is encoded by a single gene. Prp 8 p is a core component of U 5 snRNP and the U 4 /U 6. U 5 tri-snRNP, and antibodies raised against it immunoprecipitate both the major, U 2 -dependent and minor, U 12 -dependent <b>spliceosomes.</b> These <b>spliceosomes,</b> which excise different classes of introns, contain distinct sets of snRNAs overlapping only with U 5 snRNA. Other than the core Sm proteins, hPrp 8 p is the first splicing factor shown to be common to both <b>spliceosomes...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{have shown}} that galectin- 1 and galectin- 3 are {{functionally}} redundant splicing factors. Now we provide evidence that both galectins are directly associated with <b>spliceosomes</b> by analyzing RNAs and proteins of complexes immunoprecipitated by galectin-specific antisera. Both galectin antisera co-precipitated splicing substrate, splicing intermediates and products in active <b>spliceosomes.</b> Protein factors co-precipitated by the galectin antisera included the Sm core polypeptides of snRNPs, hnRNP C 1 /C 2 and Slu 7. Early spliceosomal complexes were also immunoprecipitated by these antisera. When splicing reactions were sequentially immunoprecipitated with galectin antisera, we found that galectin- 1 containing <b>spliceosomes</b> did not contain galectin- 3 and vice versa, providing {{an explanation for the}} functional redundancy of nuclear galectins in splicing. The association of galectins with <b>spliceosomes</b> was (i) not due to a direct interaction of galectins with the splicing substrate and (ii) easily disrupted by ionic conditions that had only a minimal effect on snRNP association. Finally, addition of excess amino terminal domain of galectin- 3 inhibited incorporation of galectin- 1 into splicing complexes, explaining the dominantnegative effect of the amino domain on splicing activity. We conclude that galectins are directly associated with splicing complexes throughout the splicing pathway in a mutually exclusive manner and they bind a common splicing partner through weak protein–protein interactions...|$|R
25|$|Pre-mRNAs of the Transformer (Tra) gene of Drosophila melanogaster undergo {{alternative}} splicing via the alternative acceptor site mode. The gene Tra encodes a protein that is expressed only in females. The primary transcript of this gene contains an intron with two possible acceptor sites. In males, the upstream acceptor site is used. This causes a longer version of exon 2 {{to be included}} in the processed transcript, including an early stop codon. The resulting mRNA encodes a truncated protein product that is inactive. Females produce the master sex determination protein Sex lethal (Sxl). The Sxl protein is a splicing repressor that binds to an ISS in the RNA of the Tra transcript near the upstream acceptor site, preventing U2AF protein from binding to the polypyrimidine tract. This prevents the use of this junction, shifting the <b>spliceosome</b> binding to the downstream acceptor site. Splicing at this point bypasses the stop codon, which is excised as part of the intron. The resulting mRNA encodes an active Tra protein, which itself is a regulator of {{alternative splicing}} of other sex-related genes (see dsx above).|$|E
25|$|HIV, the {{retrovirus}} {{that causes}} AIDS in humans, produces a single primary RNA transcript, which is alternatively spliced in multiple ways to produce over 40 different mRNAs. Equilibrium among differentially spliced transcripts provides multiple mRNAs encoding different {{products that are}} required for viral multiplication. One of the differentially spliced transcripts contains the tat gene, in which exon 2 is a cassette exon that may be skipped or included. The inclusion of tat exon 2 in the RNA is regulated by competition between the splicing repressor hnRNP A1 and the SR protein SC35. Within exon 2 an exonic splicing silencer sequence (ESS) and an exonic splicing enhancer sequence (ESE) overlap. If A1 repressor protein binds to the ESS, it initiates cooperative binding of multiple A1 molecules, extending into the 5’ donor site upstream of exon 2 and preventing the binding of the core splicing factor U2AF35 to the polypyrimidine tract. If SC35 binds to the ESE, it prevents A1 binding and maintains the 5’ donor site in an accessible state for assembly of the <b>spliceosome.</b> Competition between the activator and repressor ensures that both mRNA types (with and without exon 2) are produced.|$|E

40|$|The {{function}} in splicing of a heterodimeric nuclear cap binding complex (yCBC) from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been examined. Immunodepletion of splicing extracts with antibodies directed against {{one component of}} the complex, yCBP 80, results in the efficient co-depletion of the second component, yCBP 20, producing CBC-deficient splicing extract. This extract exhibits strongly reduced splicing efficiency and similar reductions in the assembly of both <b>spliceosomes</b> and of the earliest defined precursors to <b>spliceosomes,</b> commitment complexes. The addition of highly purified yCBC substantially restores these defects. These results, together with other data, suggest that CBCs play a highly conserved role in the recognition of pre-mRNA substrates at an early step in the splicing process...|$|R

500|$|Recently, it {{was shown}} {{that there is a}} single {{stranded}} covalently closed, i.e. circular form of RNA expressed throughout the animal and plant kingdom (see circRNA). circRNAs are thought to arise via a [...] "back-splice" [...] reaction where the <b>spliceosome</b> joins a downstream donor to an upstream acceptor splice site. So far the function of circRNAs is largely unknown, although for few examples a microRNA sponging activity has been demonstrated.|$|E
500|$|When the RNA is cleaved, {{polyadenylation}} starts, catalysed by polyadenylate polymerase. Polyadenylate polymerase {{builds the}} poly(A) tail by adding adenosine monophosphate units from adenosine triphosphate to the RNA, cleaving off pyrophosphate. Another protein, PAB2, binds to the new, short poly(A) tail {{and increases the}} affinity of polyadenylate polymerase for the RNA. When the poly(A) tail is approximately 250 nucleotides long the enzyme can no longer bind to CPSF and polyadenylation stops, thus determining {{the length of the}} poly(A) tail. CPSF is in contact with RNA polymerase II, allowing it to signal the polymerase to terminate transcription. When RNA polymerase II reaches a [...] "termination sequence" [...] (TTATTT on the DNA template and AAUAAA on the primary transcript), the end of transcription is signaled. The polyadenylation machinery is also physically linked to the <b>spliceosome,</b> a complex that removes introns from RNAs.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{specific}} function of CCDC130 is still unknown, {{there have been}} several studies and research papers identifying it as a component of the U5 portion of the U4/U5/U6 tri-snRNP that helps form Complex B of the human <b>spliceosome</b> after coming together with Complex A. Complex B then undergoes more modifications and conformational changes before becoming a mature <b>spliceosome.</b> In one study, the conservation of spliceosomal components is discussed by comparing the human <b>spliceosome</b> with that of yeast. In this study, CCDC130 is categorized as a known splicing factor and its homolog in yeast is Yju2. [...] This yeast protein is a splicing factor that helps form the complete, active <b>spliceosome</b> and promotes the first step of splicing, which involves cleavage at the 5' splice site of the first exon. Based on this information, it is likely that CCDC130 plays a similar role in the human <b>spliceosome,</b> but due to the higher complexity of the human <b>spliceosome,</b> this protein may perform other functions or a completely different function. Due to its high number of phosphorylation sites, it is likely that this protein is activated and recruited to the spliceosomal complex through phosphorylation or dephosphorylation (see Post-translational modifications). Since this gene is ubiquitously expressed and expressed 2.9 times higher than the average gene, it is clear that this protein plays an integral part in the proper function of the <b>spliceosome.</b>|$|E

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the formation of splicing complexes in vitro on mRNA precursors (pre-mRNAs) containing two introns. Sucrose gradient sedimentation analysis revealed that the double-intron substrate becomes associated with 60 S structures, which are larger than the 50 S splicing complexes we previously observed with single-intron pre-mRNA precursors. We have demonstrated that the 60 S complex represents the assembly of two single splicing complexes on the individual introns by conversion of the 60 S double splicing complexes into single 50 S <b>spliceosomes</b> by oligodeoxynucleotide directed RNase H cleavage of the double-intron pre-mRNAs within the middle exon. In addition, we have observed by native gel electrophoresis a transient double 'pre-splicing' complex analogous to the 35 S 'pre-splicing' complex previously found with single-intron pre-mRNAs.
