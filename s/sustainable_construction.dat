25|$|In 2009 the University of Georgia earned LEED {{certification}} {{from the}} U.S. Green Building Council with {{high marks for}} the expansion of the Tate Student Center. The renovated Tate Student Center became the sixth building on a university campus in the state of Georgia to be certified at the gold level and the second to be so designated in Athens. Following Tate's certification, Building 1516, a University housing complex constructed in 2010, is seeking Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification. The certification would mark the first LEED certified housing complex at the University of Georgia. The LEED Green Building Rating System provides a set of standards for environmentally <b>sustainable</b> <b>construction</b> and maintenance. Features of the building include; locations on each floor for students to recycle materials, increased levels of fresh air in the building, Energy Star qualified products, bioretention systems located near the building to filter pollutants from and treat stormwater runoff, a rainwater catchment system for water recycling among other installments.|$|E

40|$|The current {{financial}} and economic crisis has affected many sectors, {{and also the}} construction sector. The construction market has been and {{will be an important}} source of income for the entire Europe, totaling about 1. 650 thousand billion euro, which is more than the GDP of Italy. Building no doubt brings significant percentage in the GDP of any European country, which of course is different from country to country. In Western European countries, the residential market is almost 50 % from the construction market, while in Eastern European countries the majority is held by the civil and non-residential constructions. In addition, in the West the medium budget per capita spent on construction is 3 - 4 times higher than that spent in Eastern countries. But, according to previsions in the coming years the countries that will witness a growth, albeit small, will be the Eastern ones. The paper highlights the impact of the economic and financial crisis in the construction industry on a European and national level, as the <b>sustainable</b> <b>constructions</b> that may represent the sector’s future. construction market, economic crisis, <b>sustainable</b> <b>constructions,</b> residential constructions...|$|R
