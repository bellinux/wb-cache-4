40|$|In {{this short}} note, we discuss variational {{multiscale}} methods for solving porous media flows in high-contrast heterogeneous media with rough <b>source</b> <b>terms.</b> Our {{objective is to}} separate, as much as possible, subgrid effects induced by the media properties from those due to heterogeneous <b>source</b> <b>terms.</b> For this reason, enriched coarse spaces designed for high-contrast multiscale problems are used to represent the effects of heterogeneities of the media. Furthermore, rough <b>source</b> <b>terms</b> are captured via auxiliary correction equations that appear {{in the formulation of}} variational multiscale methods [23]. These auxiliary equations are localized and one can use additive or multiplicative constructions for the subgrid corrections as discussed in the current paper. Our preliminary numerical results show that one can capture the effects due to both spatial heterogeneities in the coefficients (such as permeability field) and <b>source</b> <b>terms</b> (e. g., due to singular well terms) in one iteration. We test the cases for both smooth <b>source</b> <b>terms</b> and rough <b>source</b> <b>terms</b> and show that with the multiplicative correction, the numerical approximations are more accurate compared to the additive correction. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|A rather novel {{approach}} to predict jet noise is the Stochastic Noise Generation and Ra-diation (SNGR) method. The SNGR method uses the linear Euler equations as an acoustic analogy together with <b>source</b> <b>terms</b> which are modeled. In other studies (Bechara 1 and Bailly 2) the Euler equations on primitive form are used. In the present work the linear Euler equations on conservative form are used. Due to this, new <b>source</b> <b>terms</b> {{have to be}} de-rived for the conservative set of equations. A formal derivation of the correct <b>source</b> <b>terms</b> for the linear Euler equations on conservative form is presented. Simplied versions of the derived <b>source</b> <b>terms</b> are also developed. To validate the derived <b>source</b> <b>terms</b> a direct si-mulation of a forced 2 D mixing layer is carried out.
