Both tensile strength and elastic modulus decreased with increasing porosity. Electrochemical assessment of the <b>sintered</b> porous <b>samples</b> showed deteriorated corrosion resistance, as compared to 95 % dense Ti- 6 Al- 4 V prepared by sintering pre-alloyed powder. The challenge of using blended elemental powder sintering to fabricate porous Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloys is discussed...|$|R

The high {{pressure}} and high temperature sintering of α-Si 3 N 4 and γ-Si 3 N 4 with Y 2 O 3 -Al 2 O 3 -La 2 O 3 as additives were studied under pressures of 5. 4 GPa and temperatures of 1420 - 1770 K. The effects of sintering temperatures and pressures on properties of <b>sintered</b> ceramic <b>samples</b> were investigated with X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The {{results show that}} γ-Si 3 N 4 and α-Si 3 N 4 is transformed to β-Si 3 N 4 completely. The highest relative densities and Vickers hardness (HV) of <b>sintered</b> <b>samples</b> are 98. 71 and 21. 76 GPa, respectively. The <b>sintered</b> <b>samples</b> were composed of elongated β-Si 3 N 4 rod crystals with disordered orientation and had intergranular interlocks and uniform and compact microstructure. Pulled out crystal grains on the fractured cross sections were obviously observed by SEM...|$|R
