5|$|Assuming {{that the}} true mass is the minimum mass, the radius may be {{calculated}} using various models. For example, if Gliese 581c is a rocky planet with a large iron core, it should have a radius approximately 50% larger than that of Earth, according to Udry's team. Gravity on such a planet's surface would be approximately 2.24 times as <b>strong</b> <b>as</b> on Earth. However, if Gliese 581c is an icy and/or watery planet, its radius would be less than 2 times that of Earth, even with a very large outer hydrosphere, according to density models compiled by Diana Valencia and her team for Gliese 876 d. Gravity {{on the surface of}} such an icy and/or watery planet would be at least 1.25 times as <b>strong</b> <b>as</b> on Earth.|$|E

5|$|Portland cement or bitumen {{may also}} be added to earth {{intended}} for construction which adds strength, although the stabilized earth is not as <b>strong</b> <b>as</b> fired clay or concrete. Mixtures of cement and lime, or pozzolana and lime, {{may also be}} used for stabilization.|$|E
5|$|Abovian was {{far ahead}} of his time and {{virtually}} none of his works was published during his lifetime. Only after the establishment of the Armenian SSR was Abovian accorded the recognition and stature he merited. Abovian is {{regarded as one of the}} foremost figures not just in Armenian literature but Armenian history at large. Abovian's influence on Western Armenian literature was not as <b>strong</b> <b>as</b> it was on Eastern Armenian, particularly in its formative years.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{resolution}} {{was not as}} <b>strong</b> <b>as</b> Mason had liked—he wanted Virginia to threaten to cut off tobacco—Mason worked in the following years for non-importation. The repeal {{of most of the}} Townshend duties (excepting that on tea) made his task more difficult. In March 1773, his wife Ann died of illness contracted after another pregnancy. Mason was the sole parent to nine children, and his commitments made him even more reluctant to accept political office that would take him from Gunston Hall.|$|E
5|$|As Geralda moved ashore, the cyclone {{produced}} wind gusts as <b>strong</b> <b>as</b> , {{among the}} strongest gusts worldwide in several decades. The storm also dropped heavy rainfall that caused landslides and severe flooding, mostly in Toamasina Province. About 80% {{of the city}} of Toamasina was destroyed, including the country's only petroleum refinery at the time. Damage to the refinery alone was estimated at $800,000.|$|E
5|$|Before the Nazko {{earthquake}} swarm began in 2007, the Anahim hotspot {{was not known}} to be an earthquake zone. On October 10 of the following year, a swarm of earthquakes occurred. These earthquakes were normally no more than magnitude 1.0 on the Richter magnitude scale, {{but at least one}} earthquake was as <b>strong</b> <b>as</b> magnitude 3.9. Since the appearance of the Nazko swarm, Natural Resources Canada has expressed interest in the adjacent 7,200‑year‑old Nazko Cone.|$|E

5|$|Even if a {{molecule}} does not form a permanent dipole, {{it can still}} be influenced by an electric field.

5|$|Following {{his time}} in prison, A.I.M {{scientists}} converted Osborn into a Super-Adaptoid, capable of absorbing the abilities of any mutant, mutate, alien, android or other such super powered being by touching them. In this form he possessed considerably increased strength and durability; where he was once approximately as <b>strong</b> <b>as</b> Spider-Man, he now possessed sufficient strength to overpower and throw Luke Cage a significant distance away from him. He could also levitate, {{and he was able}} to defeat the Vision in an aerial conflict between the two.|$|E

5|$|In 2016 a {{breakthrough}} in creating a strong light aluminium steel alloy which might be suitable in applications such as aircraft was announced by researchers at Pohang University of Science and Technology. Adding small amounts of nickel was found to result in precipitation as nano particles of brittle B2 intermetallic compounds which had previously resulted in weakness. The result was a cheap strong light steel alloy—nearly as <b>strong</b> <b>as</b> titanium at 10% of the cost—which is slated for trial production at industrial scale by POSCO, a Korean steelmaker.|$|E
5|$|Peptides {{in black}} mamba venom {{have been found}} to be {{effective}} analgesics. These peptides, part of the 'three-finger' family of snake venom toxins (mambalgins), act as inhibitors for acid-sensing ion channels in the central and peripheral nervous system, causing a pain-inihibiting effect. While this effect can be as <b>strong</b> <b>as</b> that of morphine, mambalgins do not have a resistance to naloxone, suffer less from induced tolerance, and cause no respiratory distress.|$|E
5|$|Scott's {{direction}} and visual style were praised by critics, but they criticized his formulaic {{handling of the}} story and use of conventions from the spy genre, such as surveillance shots from high-altitude spy planes.

5|$|Small-scale, tornado-like circulations {{can occur}} near any intense surface heat source. Those that occur near intense {{wildfires}} are called fire whirls.

Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was the third most intense hurricane to strike the country with a pressure of 920mbar, though its winds were not as <b>strong</b> <b>as</b> Andrew.|$|E
