5|$|When <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> {{enough to}} attend school, Razafindrahety {{was taken into}} the custody of her aunt, Queen Ranavalona II, who ensured she began {{receiving}} a private education from a London Missionary Society (LMS) teacher. She was described as an industrious and inquisitive child with a strong love of studying the Bible, learning and reading, and she developed affectionate relationships with her teachers. She continued her education throughout her adolescence at the Congregational School of Ambatonakanga, the Friends High School for Girls, and the LMS Girls' Central School. She was baptized as a Protestant at Ambohimanga on April 5, 1874. Her teachers consistently described her as ranking among their strongest students.|$|E

5000|$|What {{some people}} think of as old other people may not. An actress in Hollywood may not {{consider}} herself <b>old</b> but can <b>be</b> told <b>she</b> <b>is</b> too <b>old</b> for a part. A very well known {{example of this is}} what happened to the actress Maggie Gyllenhaal, [...] "she was recently turned down for a role in a movie because <b>she</b> <b>was</b> too <b>old</b> to play the love interest for a 55-year-old man." [...] When a woman <b>is</b> told <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>old</b> <b>she</b> can start to believe that <b>she</b> <b>is.</b> A woman can start acting as if <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>older</b> than <b>she</b> believes because she internalizes what other people are saying and what they think about her.|$|R

500|$|Hawks and Hepburn had a {{confrontation}} one day during shooting. While Hepburn was chatting {{with a crew}} member, Hawks yelled [...] "Quiet!" [...] until the only person still talking was Hepburn. When Hepburn paused and realized that everyone was looking at her, she asked what was the matter; Hawks {{asked her if she}} was finished imitating a parrot. Hepburn took Hawks aside, telling him never to talk to her like that again since <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> friends with most of the crew. When Hawks (an older friend of the crew) asked a lighting tech who he would rather drop a light on, Hepburn agreed to behave on set. A variation of this scene, with Grant yelling [...] "Quiet!", was incorporated into the film.|$|E
500|$|The serial's {{official}} website described Carmella as [...] "the youngest daughter of local mafioso Rocco Cammeniti. She grew up spoilt and sheltered {{from the real}} world, which made her {{a force to be}} reckoned with as soon as <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> enough to break free of her father's influence." [...] Carmella underwent many changes during her tenure. Blair initially described her as a [...] "fun, feisty and foxy sort of character". However, Carmella became depressed through her life's travails, having been stalked by Frank Romano, sold her cousin Teresa's baby and subsequently become a nun. Before her official confirmation in the convent, Carmella goes clubbing with ex-boyfriend Connor. Desrcibing Carmella's reasoning, Blair stated: [...] "Carmella is thinking, 'Is what I'm about to go ahead with, - becoming a nun - the right choice?' She wants to be sure she's making the right decision about what she'll do for the rest of her life." [...] Blair confirmed that after that night Carmella had [...] "all the answers that she needed" [...] to live the rest of her life. Blair enjoyed the opportunity to play a nun, but was glad when the storyline concluded as it meant Carmella got to have fun again.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} of Julia's birth, 39 BC, Augustus had not yet {{received}} the title [...] "Augustus" [...] and was known as [...] "Gaius Julius Caesar Divi Filius," [...] though historians refer to him as [...] "Octavian" [...] until [...] 27 BC, when Julia was 11. Octavian divorced Julia's mother {{the day of her}} birth and took Julia from her soon thereafter. Octavian, in accordance with Roman custom, claimed complete parental control over her. She was sent to live with her stepmother Livia when <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> enough and learn how to be an aristocrat. Her education appears to have been strict and somewhat old-fashioned. Thus, in addition to her studies, Suetonius informs us, she was taught spinning and weaving.

2500|$|Born Florence Annie Bridgwood in Hamilton, Ontario, she was {{youngest}} {{of three children}} of George Bridgwood, an English-born carriage builder and Charlotte [...] "Lotta" [...] Bridgwood (née Dunn), a vaudeville actress. Charlotte Bridgwood had emigrated to Canada from Ireland after the Great Famine with her family as a child. She was known professionally as Lotta Lawrence and was the leading lady {{and director of the}} Lawrence Dramatic Company. At the age of three, Lawrence made her debut onstage with her mother in a song and dance routine. When <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> enough to memorize lines of dialogue, she performed with her mother {{and other members of the}} Lawrence Dramatic Company in dramatic plays. After performing tear jerking dramas like Dora Thorne and East Lynne began to depress Lawrence, her mother dropped them from the company's repertoire. While Lawrence performed on stage at the behest of her mother, she recalled that she enjoyed the work but did not like the traveling that all vaudeville performers were required to do. By the age of six, Lawrence had earned the nickname [...] "Baby Flo, the Child Wonder".|$|E
2500|$|In 1993, {{at the age}} of six, Sharapova {{attended}} a tennis clinic in Moscow run by Martina Navratilova, who recommended professional training at the IMG Academy in Bradenton, Florida, which had previously trained players such as Andre Agassi, Monica Seles, and Anna Kournikova. With money tight, Yuri Sharapov borrowed the sum that would enable him and his daughter, neither of whom could speak English, to travel to the United States of America, which they finally did in 1994. Visa restrictions prevented Sharapova's mother from joining them for two years. Arriving in Florida with savings of US$700, Sharapova's father took various low-paying jobs, including dishwashing, to fund her lessons until <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> enough to be admitted to the academy. Before she entered the IMG business, she trained with Rick Macci, in the Rick Macci Tennis Academy. She then was offered a deal from IMG which forced her to change academies. Originally, she did train with Rick Macci, but after the deal with IMG, she could not see Rick Macci anymore. [...] In 1995, she was signed by IMG, who agreed to pay the annual tuition fee of $35,000 for Sharapova to stay at the Academy, allowing her to finally enroll {{at the age of}} 9.|$|E

2500|$|Hugh X de Lusignan (died 1249), a magnate of Poitou then {{nominally}} but tenuously {{ruled by}} King John as the inheritance {{from his mother}} Eleanor of Aquitaine, had been betrothed to John's daughter Princess Joan (1210–1238), by his second wife Isabella of Angouleme. The reasons for this betrothal were twofold. Firstly, to create a dynastic alliance to persuade Hugh to use his great influence in Poitou {{to the benefit of}} the English crown. The other reason is more complex: in 1200 King John had stolen away for his own second wife the great heiress Isabella of Angouleme (1188–1246), betrothed shortly before in the same year to Hugh's father Hugh IX de Lusignan. Isabelle {{was one of the greatest}} beauties of her age, and John appears to have formed a strong attachment to her person, although then aged only 12, as well as to her inheritance. To assuage the anger of Hugh IX it was agreed that his son Hugh X should marry a daughter resulting from the marriage of John and Isabelle. This daughter was Princess Joan, born in 1210, who as an infant was duly betrothed to Hugh X, at least 15 years her senior. The infant Joan was sent to live at the court of Hugh X until <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>old</b> enough to enter into matrimony as agreed. Hugh X was also given possession of his betrothed's maritagium (marriage portion) of Saintes, the Saintonge and the Isle of Oleron. However, when she was aged just 6, in 1216, King John her father died, leaving the still young and attractive Isabelle of Angouleme a widow. Hugh X thereupon decided, before 22 May 1216, to the great surprise of the English royal court and without royal licence, to marry Isabella in place of her daughter Joan, which action would have entitled him to a life interest in her dowry as Queen of England, had he obtained the required royal licence to marry a king's widow. King Henry sent him a formal congratulatory letter dated 22 May 1216, which included the request for his sister Joan to be returned to England. Yet in order to obtain his new wife's dowry, Hugh held the Princess Joan as hostage in Poitou and refused to return her to England. Isabella demanded of the regency council of her young son King Henry III the seizin of her dowry lands of Niort in Poitou, Exeter Castle and Rockingham Castle. The position thus appeared at a stalemate. In 1220 Hugh was invited by the king to come to England to attend the great ceremony of the Translation of Thomas a Becket due to occur in Canterbury Cathedral on 7 July 1220, and was assured that all outstanding issues would then be resolved. Hugh did not accept the invitation, but rather sent to Canterbury his messengers and started to oppress towns in Poitou, in an attempt to persuade Henry to concede to him both Isabella's dower and Joan's maritagium. A letter from Pope Honorius dated 25 September 1220 threatened Hugh with spiritual penalties if he did not surrender both the princess and her maritagium. Since King John had made himself a vassal of the papacy, which gave it the ultimate ownership of his kingdom, the pope had taken a great interest in the preservation of English royal possessions. In an attempt to break the deadlock, the regency council decided on 5 October 1220 to release Isabelle's English dower to Hugh, which included Berkhampstead Castle and probably also Rockingham Castle [...] In compensation for her dower lands in Normandy however, she was granted the Stannaries in Devon and the revenue of Aylesbury for a period of 4 years, with £3,000 paid for arrears in her pension In return for these concessions the following stern royal order dated 6th. October 1220 was issued by Henry to Hugh, nominally his subject as ruler of Poitou, recorded in the Patent Rolls: ...|$|E
