50|$|The <b>secondary</b> <b>connectivity</b> nearly {{conforms}} to an (ααββ)5 classification, but is more specifically described using the (ααββ)4-(αββ)−α nomenclature, where helices 6 and 8, both involved in inter-protein {{contacts in the}} crystal lattice, display a helical “kink”. The most hydrophobic section of the PT-barrel is the region residing between the outer surface of the cylindrical β-barrel and the belt of surrounding α-helices. Additionally, a number of hydrophobic residues located inside the barrel accommodate the prenyl tail of the Geranyl-diPhosphate (GPP) and GSPP molecules, while the diphosphate or the thio-diphosphate head groups of substrate and substrate analogs, respectively, point toward the “upper”, more polar end of the barrel where a Mg2+ ion is coordinated. Finally, {{the bottom of the}} barrel is capped by a short C-terminal helix (α11).|$|E
40|$|The regular {{surface layer}} (S-layer) of Clostridium aceticum has been {{isolated}} and the three-dimensional structure determined to {{a resolution of}} 2. 0 nm from tilt series of negatively stained preparations. It has tetragonal symmetry with a lattice constant of 12 nm and a thickness of 6 nm; there are probably 4 protein monomers per unit cell. A {{large proportion of the}} protein is concentrated in massive "cores" at the major four-fold axes which are situated towards the inner surface of the layer. From these cores, delicate arms extend towards the minor four-fold axes, where <b>secondary</b> <b>connectivity</b> is established near the exterior surface. When viewed from the outside, each of the cores appears to have a large central depression, rather than a true "pore". Since this general pattern of mass distribution is shared by the hexagonal S-layer of Clostridium thermohydrosulfuricum, some consideration has been given to the possible evolutionary steps leading to changes in symmetry. From modelling experiments, it is evident that the change from four-fold to six-fold symmetry in this instance could be accomplished simply by the loss of a structural "domain" from the protomer...|$|E
40|$|In Cognitive Radio Ad-Hoc Networks (CRAHN) the {{behavior}} of the primary users influences the <b>secondary</b> network <b>connectivity</b> and the relevant performance. The methodologies used to evaluate network connectivity have to be worked up to take into account this aspect. In this letter we propose the use of Laplacian matrix and its second smallest eigenvalue to measure the network algebraic connectivity of a CRAHN. We re-elaborate the Laplacian matrix in order to have in its second smallest eigenvalue a function of the primary users behavior expressed as an activity factor. In this way we are able to monitor the algebraic connectivity of CRAHNs. This metric can be a useful instrument for network planning, data routing and network maintenance. Performance results show how this methodology can be efficiently applied in this kind of networks...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyze the}} impact of primary users on the <b>secondary</b> network <b>connectivity</b> in a {{cognitive}} radio network. The analysis {{is based on the}} second smallest Laplacian eigenvalue, i. e., the algebraic connectivity, re-elaborated in a cognitive scenario. The contribution of this paper is twofold: first we derive the form of the average Laplacian matrix of the network, averaged over the random activity of the primary users, and compute the second smallest Laplacian eigenvalue of this matrix. We derive in this way the compact cognitive algebraic connectivity and we show that, in the scenarios we are interested in, it represents a valid estimation of the expected value of the cognitive algebraic connectivity. The second contribution is the evaluation of {{the impact of}} different topological parameters on the compact cognitive algebraic connectivity. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|High-resolution {{electron}} energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) {{was used to}} investigate the molecular structure of self-assembled monolayers formed by adsorption of n-alkanethiols, R,ö-alkanedithiols, and R-cycloalkyl-ö-alkanethiols on different gold substrates. The HREELS data are reported as a contribution to a general effort to assess the potential of electron spectroscopies in the elucidation of structural characteristics of organic surfaces. Typical fingerprints of the thiol molecules, characteristic of their primary and <b>secondary</b> structure (<b>connectivity,</b> conformation, and order), {{have been found in}} their HREELS vibrational spectra. We have shown that when the layers are disordered, the spectra are dominated by impact-excited modes, hampering the identification of the compounds. These data have evidenced many defects in the organization of the monolayers on evaporated gold substrates. The coherent domains sizes formed by the molecules in the films have been estimated from the angular distribution of the elastic peak {{as a function of the}} nature of the alkanethiol chain and of the immersion time in thiol solutionsPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We study a {{fundamental}} measure for wireless {{interference in the}} SINR model known as (weighted) inductive independence. This measure characterizes the effectiveness of using oblivious power — when the power used by a transmitter only depends on {{the distance to the}} receiver — as a mechanism for improving wireless capacity. We prove optimal bounds for inductive independence, implying a number of algorithmic ap-plications. An algorithm is provided that achieves — due to existing lower bounds — capacity that is asymptotically best possible using oblivious power assignments. Improved approximation algorithms are provided for a number of problems for oblivious power and for power control, in-cluding distributed scheduling, <b>connectivity,</b> <b>secondary</b> spectrum auctions, and dynamic packet scheduling. 1...|$|R
40|$|Circular {{permutation}} is {{a common}} molecular mechanism for evolution of proteins. However, such re-arrangement of <b>secondary</b> structure <b>connectivity</b> may interfere with the folding mechanism causing accumulation of folding intermediates, which in turn can lead to misfolding. We solved the crystal structure and investigated the folding pathway of a circularly permuted variant of a PDZ domain, SAP 97 PDZ 2. Our data illustrate how well circular permutation may work as a mechanism for molecular evolution. The circular permutant retains the overall structure and function of the native protein domain. Further, unlike most examples in the literature, this circular permutant displays a folding mechanism that is virtually identical {{to that of the}} wild type. This observation contrasts with previous data on the circularly permuted PDZ 2 domain from PTP-BL, for which the folding pathway was remarkably affected by the same mutation in sequence connectivity. The different effects of this circular permutation in two homologous proteins show the strong influence of sequence as compared to topology. Circular permutation, when peripheral to the major folding nucleus, may have little effect on folding pathways and could explain why, despite the dramatic change in primary structure, it is frequently tolerated by different protein folds...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{design a}} routing {{scheme based on}} an {{extension}} of the algebraic connectivity concept for cognitive radio ad hoc networks. We observe that a cognitive radio network topology and its connectivity are highly influenced by the behavior of the primary users. In some cases, even if the physical proximity of secondary nodes would give rise to a connected topology, the primary user behavior could impact the <b>secondary</b> network <b>connectivity.</b> In graph theory the second smallest Laplacian eigen-value, i. e., the algebraic connectivity, has numerous relationships with the graph characteristics, including connectivity, diameter, mean distance of vertexes. We then propose to elaborate the algebraic connectivity in a cognitive scenario where we derive the form of the average Laplacian matrix of the network, averaged over the random activity of the primary users, and compute the algebraic connectivity. On the basis of this mathematical model we build up an utility function which is shown to be effective for capturing some key characteristics of networks paths and can be used to compare them for routing purposes. We then design a routing scheme which, by modeling a path with a graph and its Laplacian, captures the connectivity characteristics of the path itself and suitably selects the best route in a uncertain and high variable connectivity scenarios.

40|$|Heroin {{addiction}} {{has been}} associated with impaired neuronal connectivity and cognitive deficits. One mechanism that potentially explains these findings is alterations in white matter <b>connectivity</b> <b>secondary</b> to chronic opiate use. However, few studies have quantitavely examined white matter deficits in opiate addiction (OA). Here, we investigated white matter microstructure in OA using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We performed voxel-wise analysis of fractional anisotropy (FA) in 24 participants with OA and 29 healthy controls. The OA group showed reduced FA in multiple pathways including the corpus callosum, thalamic radiation and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. This FA reduction was mainly the result of increased radial diffusivity (λ ⊥), indicative of myelin pathology. Longer duration of OA was also associated with axonal diffusivity (λ 1), most robustly in superior longitudinal fasciculi and right frontal white matter suggesting axonal injury in long-term users. Together, the findings indicate that chronic OA use has widespread and diverse effects on neuronal connectivity and function. © 2010 The Authors, Addiction Biolog...|$|R
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of BiologyCraig PaukertRiver {{discharge}} influences {{fish and}} invertebrate communities and understanding how hydrologic variables contribute {{to fish and}} invertebrate composition can provide information for restoration and management. This study examines the relationship between several flow regime metrics that may influence fish and invertebrate community structure in large river systems such as the Kansas River. First, I examined how hydrology influences macroinvertebrate (drifting and benthic) density and fish communities before, during, and after flooding in both main and secondary channels. I found that drifting invertebrate density increased during flooding potentially providing increased prey opportunities for fishes. I also found that fluvial dependent and generalist fish species use inundated habitats more than fluvial specialists. My {{results suggest that the}} flux of water into inundated habitats supports a unique subset of invertebrate and fish communities of the main channel. Next, I examined the importance of lateral connectivity on fish and invertebrate composition by examining differences in seasonally and permanently inundated secondary channels in relation to main channel reaches. I found that drifting and benthic invertebrate assemblages and fish assemblages differed between seasonally inundated and permanently connected secondary channels. These results suggest that maintenance of diverse secondary channel connections is useful in preserving native biota in the Kansas River. Finally, I tested if hydrologic variables influenced recruitment of four native Kansas River fishes. I found that recruitment for two of the four fish species (flathead catfish, Pylodictis olivaris, and shovelnose sturgeon, Scaphirhynchus platorynchus) increased in high flow years. These results indicate that a natural and variable flow regime may be important for maintaining fish community structure in the Kansas River. The results of this study have implications for management strategies that include the use of high flows to provide a pulse of insect prey to the main channel for fishes, restoration of natural high and low flow variability as important to fish recruitment, and diversity in <b>secondary</b> channel <b>connectivity</b> (seasonal and permanently connected) that promotes unique fish and invertebrate communities...|$|R
40|$|AbstractResting-state {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging is a powerful technique to study the whole-brain neural connectivity that underlies cognitive systems. The present study aimed to define the changes in neural connectivity in their relation to language development. Longitudinal resting-state functional data were acquired from a cohort of preschool children at age 5 and one year later, and changes in functional connectivity were correlated with language performance in sentence comprehension. For this, degree centrality, a voxel-based network measure, was used to assess age-related differences in connectivity at the whole-brain level. Increases in connectivity with age were found selectively in a cluster within the left posterior superior temporal gyrus and sulcus (STG/STS). In order to further specify the connection changes, a <b>secondary</b> seed-based functional <b>connectivity</b> analysis on this very cluster was performed. The correlations between resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and language performance revealed developmental effects with age and, importantly, also dependent on the advancement in sentence comprehension ability over time. In children with greater advancement in language abilities, the behavioral improvement was positively correlated with RSFC increase between left posterior STG/STS and other regions of the language network, i. e., left and right inferior frontal cortex. The age-related changes observed in this study provide evidence for alterations in the language network as language develops and demonstrates the viability of this approach for the investigation of normal and aberrant language development...|$|R
40|$|Many {{existing}} derivations of knowledge-based statistical pair potentials {{invoke the}} quasichemical approximation {{to estimate the}} expected side-chain contact frequency {{if there were no}} amino acid pair-specific interactions. At first glance, the quasichemical approximation that treats the residues in a protein as being disconnected and expresses the side-chain contact probability as being proportional to the product of the mole fractions of the pair of residues would appear to be rather severe. To investigate the validity of this approximation, we introduce two new reference states in which no specific pair interactions between amino acids are allowed, but in which the connectivity of the protein chain is retained. The first estimates the expected number of side-chain contracts by treating the protein as a Gaussian random coil polymer. The second, more realistic reference state includes the effects of chain <b>connectivity,</b> <b>secondary</b> structure, and chain compactness by estimating the expected side-chain contrast probability by placing the sequence of interest in each member of a library of structures of comparable compactness to the native conformation. The side-chain contact maps are not allowed to readjust to the sequence of interest, i. e., the side chains cannot repack. This situation would hold rigorously if all amino acids were the same size. Both reference states effectively permit the factorization of the side-chain contact probability into sequence-dependent and structure-dependent terms. Then, because the sequence distribution of amino acids in proteins is random, the quasichemical approximation to each of these reference states is shown to be excellent. Thus, the range of validity of the quasichemical approximation is determined by the magnitude of the side-chain repacking term, which is, at present, unknown. Finally, the performance of these two sets of pair interaction potentials as well as side-chain contact fraction-based interaction scales is assessed by inverse folding tests both without and with allowing for gaps...|$|R
