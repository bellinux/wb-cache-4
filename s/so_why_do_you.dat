We're awful. And the Yankees are usually really good. <b>So</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> boo us? You should feel badly for us.

6000|$|... "Is it <b>so?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> {{not tell}} me that before? The descent should earn you a pension from the Court if you can extract it from Nehesi. Well, Userti, his {{grandfather}}'s name was Pentaur whose immortal verses you have doubtless read upon temple walls, where our grandfather was careful to publish them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why <b>so?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> say it? Why do you torment me? Why do you banish me at once, {{and tell}} me that I must go home a wretched, miserable man? Why?--why?--why? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, do {{not look}} so! You appal me! Oh, what can the matter be? What is it you see? Why do you stare <b>so?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> work your fingers like that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{as that is}} <b>so,</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not go and see her? I am {{sure you}} are {{not one of those}} who would play such a trick as that upon such a girl with the mere purpose of amusing yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Which is a {{contingency}} you naturally wished to avoid? I congratulated you upon your prudence once before. Still, you, at least, seemed quite {{acquainted with the}} characteristics of the fever belt of Western Africa when you went out. Your friends the mailboats' officers must have told <b>you.</b> That being <b>so,</b> <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> go?" ...|$|R

6000|$|Foster's face got red, but he laughed. [...] "This is too much, sir! If your suspicions went <b>so</b> far, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> {{not tell}} the police?" ...|$|R
60|$|Ebremar. Oh! hush the {{wandering}} music of thy mind. Look on me once. Why sink your eyelids <b>so?</b> <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> hang so heavy in my arms? Love, will you die {{when we have}} met? One look Give to thy Vallence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thus you may {{say again}} before {{everything}} is done, husband; {{but if it}} be <b>so,</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> love me and tie me to you with your wizardry? Cut the knot, and let me go my way while you go yours." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Are {{you only}} a servant, perhaps, that rather {{sinister}} old servant who was butler to Hawker and Verner? If so, you are certainly the only {{link between the}} two periods. But if <b>so,</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> degrade yourself to serve this dirty foreigner, when you at least saw {{the last of a}} genuine national gentry? People like you are generally at least patriotic. Doesn't England mean anything to you, Mr. Usher? All of which eloquence is possibly wasted, as perhaps you are not Mr. Usher.|$|E

60|$|While I am {{mentioning}} these things, methinks it is {{very hard}} that we should obey the whispers of evil spirits, and not much rather receive the notices which good ones are pleased to give. We never perceive the misfortune of this, but when in real danger; and then we cry, My mind misgave me when I was going about it; but if <b>so,</b> <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> fight the caution? Why not listen to it as to a voice? and then there had been no reason to make this complaint.|$|E
6000|$|... "Almighty! do {{you suppose}} that I sit here to answer riddles?" [...] replied Jan, pulling at his great beard. [...] "Why do I call you son, indeed? Ah!"

6000|$|... "John," [...] he said, [...] "I cannot {{speak to}} the {{lightning}} in a voice which it can hear.

Have I not told {{you the story of}} Elijah the prophet and the priests of Baal? Did Elijah's Master forsake him, and shall He forsake us? Also this is certain, that all the medicine of Hokosa and his wizards will not turn a lightning flash by the breadth of a single hair. God alone can turn it, {{and for the sake of}} His cause among these people I believe that He will do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, yes; I suppose <b>so.</b> <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> {{not come}} to Ostend? There is better bathing there, and I could have <b>done</b> {{something}} for <b>you.</b> What! The horses ready, are they? I must go out and show myself, or otherwise they'll all think that I am dead. If I were absent from the boulevard {{at this time of}} day I should be put into the newspapers. Where is Mrs. Richards?"

6000|$|... "And if <b>you</b> <b>do</b> look {{perfectly}} sweet in your white trousers, why shouldn't I say <b>so?</b> And <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> {{put them}} on, if you didn't {{think you were}} going to look sweet in them?" ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> {{tell the}} late Emperor that non-Han cannot be {{military}} governors?

It was so long ago; {{and it was not}} out of malice to you, but to save the man she loved. You hear me, do you not? You are listening. She has not {{forgotten}} you. Often she sorrows for you. It was cruel--I know that it was cruel--but she was a woman, and she loved him. Let us steal away together and bury these dark dreams of the past. I will never leave you; I will wait upon you always; I will be your slave. Forgiveness is more sweet than vengeance.

50|$|Then {{he thought}} of Casabianca. He had been {{examined}} in that poem by his father not long before. 'When only would he leave his position? To whom did he call? Did he get an answer? Why?
