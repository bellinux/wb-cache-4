Cargo could be transported quicker {{and for a}} cheaper price by steamer than by sailing ship. The post Confederation policy of the Canadian government forced trade with Upper Canada, using the inland railway.

40|$|One of the {{responses}} to more favourable dry-bulk cargo market conditions has been {{the extension of the}} commercial life <b>of</b> Capesize <b>vessels.</b> It is argued here that in assessing the <b>seaworthiness</b> <b>of</b> such <b>vessels</b> the cardinal factor is age. Regulations have been instituted in an attempt to ensure those vessels deemed to be unsafe are denied the opportunity to trade. The central premise of this discussion is of the uneven manner, internationally, in which these regulations have been and are enforced. The proof of this lies, as the analysis highlights, in the recent greater concentration of comparatively modern tonnage in certain regional trades as against the congregating of ageing tonnage in others. ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{good many}} years ago Brazil {{made an effort to}} {{construct}} an ironclad from her own yards. The effort was commendable enough, but want of experience was bound to tell its tale, and, as a result, the <b>seaworthiness</b> <b>of</b> this particular <b>vessel</b> was always <b>of</b> a dubious quality.

To test this concept, the Board resolved that four Infernal-class bombs, including Infernal herself, would be ketch-rigged and the other three ship-rigged, and that their relative performance would determine future bomb vessel design.|$|R
40|$|A {{complex of}} ice cover {{characteristics}} and {{the season of}} the year {{were considered in relation}} to vessel route planning in ice-covered areas on the NSR. The criteria for navigation in ice - both year-round and seasonal were analyzed. The analysis of the experts knowledge, dissipated in the literature, allowed to identify some rules of route planning in ice-covered areas. The most important processes from the navigation point of view are the development and disintegration of ice, the formation and disintegration of fast ice and behavior of the ice massifs and polynyas. The optimal route is selected on basis of available analysis and forecast maps of ice conditions and ice class, draught and <b>seaworthiness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vessel.</b> The boundary <b>of</b> the ice indicates areas accessible to vessels without ice class. Areas with a concentration of ice from 0 to 6 / 10 are used for navigation <b>of</b> <b>vessels</b> <b>of</b> different ice classes. Areas of concentration of ice from 7 / 10 up are eligible for navigation for icebreakers and vessels with a high ice class with the assistance of icebreakers. These rules were collected in the decision tree. Following such developed decision-making model the master <b>of</b> the <b>vessel</b> may take decision independently by accepting grading criteria of priorities resulting from his knowledge, experience and the circumstances of navigation. Formalized form of decision making model reduces risk of the "human factor" in the decision and thereby help improve the safety of maritime transport...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{document}} was issued {{under the authority}} of another institution, not NPS. At the time it was written, a copy was added to the NPS Library collection for reasons not now known.  It has been included in the digital archive for its historical value to NPS.  Not believed to be a CIVINS (Civilian Institutions) title. The problem in design and construction of ships are somewhat different from the problems confronting the designers of land structures such as bridges and buildings. Water-tightness, smallest possible deadweight tonnage consistent with the required dimensions, and extreme conditions of stress encountered in hogging and sagging in heavy seaways, are the outstanding special problems. Since the introduction of mild steel, in lieu of wrought iron, as the principle material in ship construction, the scantlings (sizes of plates and frames in ship building) have been reduced and the designs simplified, in general. Riveted construction had progressed to the limit where further simplification and reduction in scantlings would impair the <b>seaworthiness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vessel.</b> The advent <b>of</b> welding, as the method of fabrication, changed the whole picture and opened up many possibilities for economies in construction as well as being the means of approaching the ideal joint.

40|$|This {{report is}} aimed to {{investigate}} the ISPS-code and voyage chartering, and investigate how the code affects the charterer and owner. The SOLAS convention was amended in 2004 {{as a result of}} the new terror threat, and the ISPS-code was then added to the convention as an annex. The new code affects different parties involved in voyage chartering, and everyone has to adapt to the new routines. Furthermore, some parts of voyage chartering are more vulnerable than others. Laytime is an essential part of a ships voyage, and a vast amount of money is linked to a vessel’s portstay. A violation of the ISPS-code allows the designated authorities in charge of maintaining the protection of ships and port to intervene and investigate the cause of non-compliance during the vessels portstay. Thus, the laytime can be directly affected by the ISPS-code. The question is who is responsible for the delays and in turn the economic risk of an ISPS related delay or cancellation of voyage? As a result of our investigation, we concluded that the ISPS-code is related to the <b>seaworthiness</b> <b>of</b> a <b>vessel.</b> If the obligations of the security requirements are not met, the vessel can be classified as non-seaworthy. In most voyage charterparties, such as GENCON 94, there is a clause that states that the owner shall provide a seaworthy ship. In English jurisdiction, the owner’s responsibilities to provide a seaworthy ship is even a so called implied term. Hence, a breach of the ISPS-code is directly linked to the <b>seaworthiness</b> <b>of</b> the ship, and the owner is responsible for the delays caused by lack of ISPS documents and certificates...|$|R
50|$|Having been {{surrounded}} by Lake Michigan {{while growing up}} in Chicago, {{as well as by the}} Atlantic Ocean while he was educated in Bermuda, Boylan was interested in sea-going and its vessels. The 1932 Olympic Games in Los Angeles sparked enthusiasm for small boat racing in the area. Actors and athletes founded their own Yacht Clubs. In 1933, writers in the Los Angeles area banded together to form their own yacht club with membership exclusive to writers. Boylan was the original Vice-Commodore of this organization which was named the Pacific Writer's Yacht Club. In 1934, after having been elected Commodore of the Yacht Club, Boylan invited Lt. Francis C. Pollard (commander of the US Coast Guard Cutter Aurora stationed in the Los Angeles Harbor) to join him on a voyage being conducted by the Yacht Club after Pollard donated his time to inspect the <b>seaworthiness</b> <b>of</b> club <b>vessels.</b> During the trip from Los Angeles to Catalina Island, discussions between the two men resulted in the formation of the United States Coast Guard Reserve and the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary. After the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary and Reserves were founded by an act of Congress on June 23, 1939, Boylan rose to the office of Commodore in the Auxiliary (11th District); in addition, he retired with the rank of Lt. Commander in the Reserves.|$|R
