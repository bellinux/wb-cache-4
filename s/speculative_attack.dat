40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to {{investigate}} the hypothesis that currency crisis models based on macroeconomic fundamentals explain, to some extent, the occurrence of <b>speculative</b> <b>attacks</b> and currency crisis in Brazil between January 1982 and January 1999. For this purpose, the external sector of the Brazilian economy was analyzed to identify <b>speculative</b> <b>attacks</b> and currency crises. An adaptation of one of the main first generation models of currency crisis was used as theoretical background, producing an equation of the probability of occurrence of <b>speculative</b> <b>attacks</b> as function of macroeconomic variables. As an empirical application for the case of Brazil, an econometric model was utilized to estimate the parameters of this equation. The results were compatible with the hypothesis of the model. The probability of occurrence of <b>speculative</b> <b>attacks</b> grows with the monetary suply, the real effective exchange rate, the international interest rate, and the liberalization of capital controls and diminishes with the international reserves, the real gross domestic product, the exchange rate fixed by the government, the square of the international interest rate, the external price level, and the international trade in goods. The estimated equations for the probability of occurrence of currency crises and <b>speculative</b> <b>attacks</b> showed its usefulness to predict the imminence of these events. ...|$|R
50|$|A {{currency}} crisis {{is a situation}} in which serious doubt exists as to whether a country's central bank has sufficient foreign exchange reserves to maintain the country's fixed exchange rate. The crisis is often accompanied by a <b>speculative</b> <b>attack</b> in the foreign exchange market. A {{currency crisis}} results from chronic balance of payments deficits, and thus is also called a balance of payments crisis. Often such a crisis culminates in a devaluation of the currency.|$|E
50|$|After {{more than}} a year of high tension in markets for European Monetary System (EMS) currencies, member {{countries}} agreed in August 1993 to widen the fluctuation bands for most Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) rates from 2.25 percent around par to 15 percent. What is remarkable about subsequent ERM experience is the bark in the night that was not heard: by August 1995, the French franc, Belgian franc, and Danish krone, all of which came under intense <b>speculative</b> <b>attack</b> in 1992-93, were not far from the lower edges of the original ERM bands that had been widened two years previously. The greater exchange-rate flexibility conferred by the broad bands, while tactically convenient for policy on occasion, did not lead to substantial long-run currency depreciation. Since August 1993: all three countries’ unemployment rates remain in double digits, Belgium’s public debt still exceeds its annual GDP. Thus, the exchange-rate record throws doubt on the applicability to these countries of classical theories of rational <b>speculative</b> <b>attack,</b> in which a fixed exchange rate contains inflationary pressures which ultimately explode in a sudden balance-of-payments crisis that frees the currency to depreciate.|$|E
