40|$|The carbon-coated Si-Cu/graphite {{composite}} {{was obtained}} by mechanical milling of mixture of Si-Cu alloy and graphite followed by pyrolysis reaction of coal-tar pitch. XRD and SEM results showed Cu 5 Si alloy was formed after the intensive ball milling and SiC phase appeared after pyrolysis, composite particles were encapsulated by carbon matrix and the surface become smooth and compact. The electrochemical results exhibited the introduction of carbon-coating process decreased reversible capacity but obviously improved cycle performance. The reduced capacity {{was related to the}} inactive SiC phase and the improved cycle performance is mainly attributed to the homogeneous distribution of nanosized Si in <b>silicon–copper</b> alloy and elastic carbon matrix...|$|E
40|$|Present {{investigation}} {{pertains to}} analyse some aspect {{on the cold}} deformation behaviour of sintered <b>silicon–copper</b> steel preforms. The well-established phenomenon for raising the density in the powder metallurgy preform is to induce the extended strain. An attempt {{has been made to}} understand the attained densification as a function of new strain parameter, which results in a power law relationship. Further interest has shown to compare the conventional plastic Poisson’s ratio to instantaneous Poisson’s ratio, for which theoretical description were also made. This analysis shows some marginal difference between them; however, its characteristic nature is unique. In addition, various stresses that influence the deformation behaviour are also studied with respect to the induced axial strain...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} setup {{to measure}} the thermal contact conductance across a <b>silicon-copper</b> (Si-Cu) interface is described, and the results obtained are presented. The resulting thermal contact resistance data are used in estimating the thermo-mechanical and optical performance of optical substrates cooled by interfaced copper cooling blocks. Several factors influence the heat transfer across solid interfaces. These include the material properties, interface pressure, flatness and roughness of the contacting surfaces, temperature, and interstitial material, if any. Results presented show the variation of thermal contact conductance {{as a function of}} applied interface pressure for a Cu-Si interface. Various interstitial materials investigated include iridium foil, silver foil and a liquid eutectic (Ga-In-Sn). As expected, thermal contact resistance decreases as interface pressure increases, except {{in the case of the}} eutectic, in which it was nearly constant.

40|$|The {{issue of}} thermal contact {{resistance}} across metallic interfaces {{has been investigated}} for many situations {{over the past several}} decades. The application in the present case is contact cooling of high heat load optical substrates. High heat load x-ray mirrors and other optical components used at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) are either internally cooled or contact cooled. In the internally cooled mirrors, a coolant flows through passages configured in the optical substrate. In the contact-cooled case, cooling is provided by placing cooling plates in contact with the mirror to extract the heat. Here, an experimental setup to measure the thermal contact conductance across a <b>silicon-copper</b> (Si-Cu) interface is described, and the results obtained are presented.
