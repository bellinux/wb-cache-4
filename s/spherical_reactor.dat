This article reports the accident tests {{performed on the}} first two fuel elements HFR-EU 1 bis/ 1 and HFR-EU 1 bis/ 3 with the Küfa device. The fuel elements were heated up to the irradiation temperature (1250 °C) and then to accident temperatures (1600 °C and 1700 °C, respectively) for durations of several hundred hours to simulate depressurization and loss-of-forced- circulation accidents (D-LOFC). The overall low fractional release of 85 Kr and the absence of steps in the release curves suggest that no coated particles failed during the accident simulations. On the other hand, the fractional release of 134 Cs and 137 Cs was much higher than in previous experiments, indicating increased diffusion through the coating layers at the higher irradiation temperature, as confirmed with a finite-difference diffusion calculation. Finally, the calculation suggests that the high fractional silver and cesium releases at 1250 °C are due to a matrix contamination prior to the Küfa accident testing. © 2011 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Part I: Porous carbons are of {{interest}} in many applications because of their high surface areas and other physicochemical properties, and much effort has been directed towards developing new methods for controlling the porosity of carbons. Ultrasonic spray pyrolysis (USP) is an aerosol method suitable for large-scale, continuous synthesis of materials. Ultrasound is used to create aerosol droplets of a precursor solution which serve as micron-sized <b>spherical</b> <b>reactors</b> for materials synthesis. This work presents a precursor system for the template-free USP synthesis of porous carbons using low-cost precursors that do not evolve or require hazardous chemicals: sucrose {{was used as the}} carbon source, and sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, or sodium nitrate was added as a decomposition catalyst and porogen. The USP carbons had macroporous interiors and microporous shells with surface areas as high as 800 m 2 /g and a narrow pore size distribution. It was determined that the interior porosity was a result of the gas evolution from salt decomposition and not from the presence of a salt template. Porous carbon is frequently used as a catalyst support because it provides high surface area and it is chemically and physically stable under many anoxic reaction conditions. Typically, the preparation of supported catalysts requires multiple steps for carbonization and metal impregnation. In this work, iron-impregnated porous carbon microspheres (Fe-C) were prepared by a one-step USP process by incorporating both the carbon and metal sources into the precursor solution. Carbonization, pore formation, metal impregnation, and metal activation occurred simultaneously to produce Fe-C materials with surface areas as high as 800 m 2 /g and up to 10 wt% Fe incorporated as nanoparticles 109 K/sec). In solid-liquid slurries, surface erosion and particle fracture occur due to the shockwaves and microjets formed from asymmetric bubble collapse at extended surfaces. The chemical and physical effects of ultrasound have been studied as an adjunct to the traditional chemical pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass for ethanol production. Lignocellulosic biomass consists of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The surface effects of ultrasound were used in this work to increase the accessibility of the cellulose, which can be converted to glucose and then fermented into ethanol. The lignocellulosic biomass used in this work was Miscanthus x giganteus (Mxg) which was grown at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The chemical effects of NaOH pretreatment on Mxg were enhanced by ultrasound: greater delignification and {{a significant increase in the}} amount of pores > 5 nm were observed. ~ 70 % of the theoretical glucose yield was obtained by enzymatic saccharification of the ultrasound-assisted NaOH-pretreated Mxg; this is comparable to the yields that can be obtained by traditional alkaline pretreatments, but it was achieved in a shorter time and at a lower temperature. Because the apparatus used for laboratory studies is not a likely device for scale-up, the economics of ultrasound with regards to energy balance are not yet resolved...|$|R

This cannot be explained by the currently proposed nucleation pathway (e. g. Koch et al., 2000). On the contrary, the involvement of secondary ozonides enables to explain the observations. 2. Aim of the research In order to get a deeper insight in the initiation processes of particle formation, a new flow tube was built, which enables to study the initial particle formation under various experimental conditions. Therein it is especially aimed to answer the atmospherically important question of the influence of water vapour on the new formed aerosol particles. 3.

At its bottom the sampling outlet is fixed, while different reaction time steps are adjustable by a movable mixing plunger (inlet), where the two inlet flows (center and outer flow) are mixed. The center flow contains synthetic air or oxygen and ozone, whereas the outer flow admixes synthetic air or nitrogen, monoterpene and, depending on the planned experiment, water vapour and additional compounds.

3000|$|Another {{experimental}} technique able {{to provide}} high quality kinetic measurements is a jet stirred reactor (JSR). A typical JSR consists of four capillary jets that eject incoming gases at high velocity (on the order of 50 to 100 [*]m/s) into a <b>spherical</b> <b>reactor</b> vessel inducing thorough stirring of the reactor’s content, allowing one to assume perfect mixing. The mathematical description of the reactor involves a system of algebraic equations, which are more readily solved than a system of ordinary differential equations or partial differential equations required for turbulent (plug) and laminar flow reactors, respectively. JSR allows obtaining high quality measurements of formation of chemical species needed for developing kinetic models of oxidation. A study on the oxidation of linseed oil in the gas phase in a JSR in the temperature window from 550 to 750 K may yield significant insights into the mechanism of hydroperoxide formation, suggesting a new avenue of inquiry for future research.

40|$|Abstract: Represented are {{original}} {{developments in}} the sphere of reinforced-concrete nuclear reactor industry. The principle of cylindrical and <b>spherical</b> <b>reactor</b> shells creation is a basis of these developments. This novelty excludes application of the globally accepted and very complicated in structural and technological aspect prestress, connected with the use of hoop, vertical and radial reinforcement. The corresponding strength of walls in the variant under consideration shall be ensured by application of a new modification of highly-reinforced concrete- heavy ferrocement, which features unique cracking resistance and increased elastic strength. End elements are made in the form of taper plates of common reinforced concrete, freely supported by taper wall narrowing in the similitude of plugs, with predominance of compressive stresses under conditions of internal pressure. Such coupling significantly decreases concentration of tensile stresses in corner areas of end elements. The results of unique experiments with the large-scale physical models at high internal pressure and increased temperatures, as well as the data of numerical experiments are represented. Calculations are made with the use of original nonlinear calculation techniques on the basis of finite element method taking into account the anisotropy and non-homogeneity of material response under loads and actions, as well as specific character of walls coupling with end elements. Prerequisites are laid for creation of reliable shells of high pressure and temperature for reactors, accumulators and other pressure vessels.

40|$|Abstract: A {{series of}} fusion power plants (named FDS series) have been {{designed}} and assessed for {{the examination of the}} feasibility and the safety, environmental and economical potential of fusion with emphasizing the blanket design optimization on neutronics, thermal-hydraulics, electro-magnetics, material and structural and safety performance analyses in China. Four concepts have been developing, which are the fusion-driven subcritical system (FDS-I) with the goal of transmutation of the long-lived nuclear waste and breeding of fissile nuclear fuel, the fusion power reactor (FDS-II) with a goal of electricity generation, the fusion-based hydrogen production reactor (FDS-III) and the <b>spherical</b> tomakak-based compact <b>reactor</b> (FDS-ST). Four types of blankets, including the He gas/liquid lithium-lead dual-cooled high level waste transmutation (DWT) blanket, the He-cooled LiPb tritium breeder (SLL) blanket and the He/LiPb dual-cooled (DLL) blanket, the high temperature liquid lithium-lead (HTL) blanket probably considering SiCf/SiC composite or other refractory materials as the insulator, and TBMs (test blanket modules) scenarios and the test strategy have been studied. In this contribution, a design overview of FDS series reactors including lithium-lead blankets and relevant TBMs are presented, as well as a proposed roadmap of fusion energy development in China.

Instead of being <b>spherical,</b> the new <b>reactor</b> was built in a cube-like shape, about 25 ft tall with a base approximately 30 ft square. It was surrounded by concrete walls 5 ft thick that acted as a radiation shielding, with overhead protection from 6 in of lead and 50 in of wood. More uranium was used, so it contained 52 ST of uranium and 472 ST of graphite. No cooling system was provided as it only ran at a few kilowatts. CP-2 became operational in March 1943, with a k of 1.055. During the war Zinn allowed CP-2 to be run around the clock, and its design was suitable for conducting experiments.CP-2 was joined by Chicago Pile-3, the first heavy water reactor, which went critical on 15 May 1944.|$|R
