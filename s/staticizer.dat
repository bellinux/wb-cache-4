40|$|At the {{nanoscale}} level, parameter {{variations in}} fabricated devices cause extreme variability in delay. Delay variations {{are also the}} main issue in subthreshold operation. Consequently, asynchronous logic seems an ideal, and probably unavoidable choice, {{for the design of}} digital circuits in nano CMOS or other emerging technologies. This paper examines the robustness of one particular asynchronous logic: quasi-delay insensitive or QDI. We identify the three components of this logic that can be affected by extreme variability: <b>staticizer,</b> isochronic fork, and rings. We show that staticizers can be eliminated, and isochronic forks and rings can be made arbitrarily robust to timing variations...|$|E
40|$|VLSI Design looking towards {{to solve}} design constructions that arises when using clock pulses. The {{majority}} of the constrains can be overcome by using asynchronous logic, additionally synchronous circuits has some inherent advantages over synchronous counterparts. This paper demonstrates the design of efficient asynchronous pipelines for some standard logic circuits and medium scale integration (MSI) circuits. The performance analysis of various templates is designed for different standard logics and MSI circuits. The QDI templates are highly tolerant of process variations due to {{the up and down}} transitions are sensed. QDI circuits are quite robust in terms of process variations and design tolerances. In this work, expose a timing assumption used in <b>staticizers</b> for QDI logic and apply it to other parts of circuits. Goal of this work is to optimize circuits with respect to area and power while maintaining the robustness...|$|R
