5|$|The trio {{eventually}} {{reach an}} underground temple where the Thugs worship Kali with human sacrifice. They {{watch as the}} Thugs chain one of their victims in a cage and <b>slowly</b> <b>lower</b> him into a ceremonial fire pit, burning him alive. They discover that the Thugs, led by their high priest Mola Ram, are in possession {{of three of the}} five Sankara stones, and have enslaved the children to mine for the final two stones. As Indy tries to retrieve the stones, he, Willie, and Shorty are captured and separated. Indy is whipped and forced to drink a potion called the Blood of Kali, which places him in a trance-like state where he begins to mindlessly serve the Thugs. Willie, meanwhile, is kept as a human sacrifice, while Shorty is put to work in the mines alongside the enslaved children. Shorty breaks free and escapes back into the temple where he burns Indy with a torch, shocking him out of the trance. After defeating Chattar Lal, Indy stops Willie's cage and cranks it out of the pit just in time before it has a chance to enter the fire. They go back to the mines to free the children, but Indy is caught up in a fight with a hulking overseer. The Maharajah, who was also entranced, attempts to cripple Indy with a voodoo doll. Shorty spars with the Maharajah, ultimately burning him to snap him out of the trance. With his strength returned, Indy kills the overseer. The Maharajah then tells Shorty {{how to get out of}} the mines. While Mola Ram escapes, Indy and Shorty rescue Willie and retrieve the three Sankara stones, the village children escape.|$|E
2500|$|A spindle {{containing}} {{a quantity of}} yarn rotates more easily, steadily, and continues longer than an empty one; hence, the next improvement was {{the addition of a}} weight called a spindle whorl {{at the bottom of the}} spindle. These whorls are discs of wood, stone, clay, or metal with a hole in the centre for the spindle, which keep the spindle steady and promote its rotation. Spindle whorls appeared in the Neolithic era. They allowed the spinner to <b>slowly</b> <b>lower,</b> or drop, the spindle as it was spinning, thus allowing a greater quantity of yarn to be created before it had to be wound onto the spindle; hence the name [...] "drop spindle," [...] which is now most commonly used for the hand spindle with whorl attached.|$|E
2500|$|Avoid {{using the}} {{pectoral}} muscles, such as by pushing {{on the chair}} arms to assist one's self out of a chair, or by using the arms to assist in sitting down. Proper standing technique is to rock {{three times in the}} chair and then stand to provide momentum for moving the center of gravity from the sitting to the standing position. Proper sitting technique is to <b>slowly</b> <b>lower</b> the bottom toward the chair seat using gluteus and quadriceps muscles ("legs only") without grabbing the chair arms. Second, patients should avoid lifting objects utilizing the pectoral muscles: carrying light objects with arms extended [...] down at sides, and lifting light objects with the elbows pressed to the chest and using the biceps, are acceptable. Also, avoid using the arms overhead.|$|E

60|$|Then I looked round {{again into}} the deck-house. The whole place was full of the smoke of my own firing, just as my ears seemed to be burst with {{the noise of the}} shots. But there was Alan, {{standing}} as before; only now his sword was running blood to the hilt, and himself so swelled with triumph and fallen into so fine an attitude, that he looked to be invincible. Right before him on the floor was Mr. Shuan, on his hands and knees; the blood was pouring from his mouth, and he was sinking <b>slowly</b> <b>lower,</b> with a terrible, white face; and just as I looked, some of those from behind caught hold of him by the heels and dragged him bodily out of the round-house. I believe he died as they were doing it.|$|E

30|$|To {{make the}} samples of crude membrane, firstly, the die walls, {{surfaces}} of punch and the die are greased with Stark Oil. Secondly, the homogeneous mixture is {{poured into the}} die. Then, 4 tons of pressure is gently applied on the die. After a few seconds, the pressure is <b>slowly</b> <b>lowered</b> and the crude membrane {{is removed from the}} die. It is to be noted that the pressure is <b>slowly</b> <b>lowered</b> to prevent incarnating the air mass among the particles, which causes some cracks on the samples.|$|R

5000|$|... 1. <b>Slowly</b> <b>lower</b> {{the water}} level behind the dam. Physically cut a notch in the {{position}} on the dam where beaver pipes are to be installed. In this case, a shovel and pitchfork were used. It {{is important to note}} that this process may take a significant amount of time depending on the volume of water already in reserve behind the dam. In the case at Cielo, this dam controlled {{the water level}} in a very small pond and was drained to the desired level in about two days. It is suggested that prior to beginning this project, a marker be installed that shows the target water depth so installers know when the correct water depth has been achieved.|$|E

30|$|The seated push-up test is {{a method}} of {{assessing}} {{the strength of the}} triceps, shoulder and scapular muscles. The test involves pushing the body up out of a seated position, and <b>slowly</b> <b>lowering</b> it back into the seat. The participant was placed with the knees out straight and the heels resting on the floor or table. The participant had to push their body up from the table or floor until the elbows were straight, held for 20  seconds and then <b>slowly</b> <b>lowered</b> back into the seat. The reliability of revised push-up test protocol in people without disabilities was 0.80 to 0.96 (Hong et al. 2011).|$|R

50|$|The {{following}} mental exercise may {{illustrate the}} meaning of topographic prominence. Imagine you are standing {{at the top of}} a peak and imagine that an imaginary sea level (based on an elevation above the Geoid) rises to your feet. Now <b>slowly</b> <b>lower</b> the imaginary sea level and an imaginary island appears beneath your feet. Your island will grow and will merge with other islands that emerge. Eventually, your island will touch an island with a higher peak than your island (i.e., an imaginary island that existed before you started lowering the imaginary sea level.) The summit of that island is the parent peak of your summit, the point at which the two islands touch is the key col of your summit, and the elevation rise from the key col to your summit is the topographic prominence of your summit.|$|E
50|$|In Career mode, pursuits are {{integrated}} into the game {{in such a way}} that it is necessary to participate in pursuit in order to be able to challenge Blacklist racers. The player must complete Milestones which involve committing at least a specified amount of traffic offenses or pursuit lengths during a pursuit, and collecting an amount of Bounty, a form of credit accumulated as players continue to evade the police or damage police units. A car's heat level may be reduced by changing the physical appearance of a car by changing body parts or paint color, or by using another purchased car with a lower heat level to race in the streets. If a car is not being used by the player its heat level will <b>slowly</b> <b>lower</b> over time. Rap sheets, with records such as the player's infractions, cost to state, deployed tactics and pursuit lengths, are also available for viewing by hacking into police records.|$|E
50|$|Roll-offs {{are placed}} by {{roll-off}} trucks. As the roll-off truck raises its hydraulically operated bed, the roll-off container rolls off the bed. A cable {{is used to}} <b>slowly</b> <b>lower</b> the container. After the waste container is loaded, the roll-off truck pulls the filled container onto the roll-off truck by using a cable and winch system. If the roll-off truck is not a winch system, then it is most likely a hook-lift system. A hook-lift system works by the truck extending a 90 degree arm with a hook on the end which hooks under a bar and gently lifts the dumpster onto the truck. Most hook-lift systems are on smaller roll-off trucks as they are usually used for 20 yard containers and under. These smaller systems are usually the preferred option on smaller scale construction jobs such as roof replacement, kitchen remodels, and garage clean-outs. Smaller single-axle trucks are generally viewed as safer operations as they are much lighter and more easily transported in residential areas. When being carried, the roll-off must be covered.|$|E
