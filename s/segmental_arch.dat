5|$|Open-spandrel <b>segmental</b> <b>arch</b> bridge: The {{earliest}} known fully stone open-spandrel <b>segmental</b> <b>arch</b> {{bridge is}} the Zhaozhou Bridge in southern Hebei province, China, completed in 605 by the Sui Dynasty (581–618) engineer Li Chun. The bridge span is 37.5m (123ft) {{and the structure}} relatively light in weight due to the four semi-circular arch spandrels which allow for additional flood waters to pass through. Other Chinese bridges would be influenced by this design, such as the open-spandrel Yongtong Bridge of Zhaoxian, Hebei built in 1130, and the simple <b>segmental</b> <b>arch</b> Lugou Bridge built in 1698 (originally in 1189). The latter, located just west of Beijing and features eleven segmental arches.|$|E
5|$|The stables {{were built}} in 1820, during {{the early part of}} the Admiral's {{ownership}} of the estate, based on a design by John Smith; the buildings are sited to the rear of the mansion house. Built in a horseshoe-shape, neo-classical design, the two-storey building was constructed in pinned rubble with granite dressings; grey granite was used for the parapet and quoins. The main buildings were originally harled. A corrugated asbestos hipped roof was at some point substituted for the original slate roof. It features a columned rotunda above a timber clock tower, which has a finial and domed copper roof. The pedimented centrepiece of the symmetrical front elevation is a <b>segmental</b> <b>arch</b> and has three panels set back between columns. Each side is bordered by wings of three bays with single-bay pavilions.|$|E
5|$|The two-storey façade to Viaduct Road is E-shaped and regular, with a {{symmetrical}} seven-bay plan. The {{first and}} seventh bays project further forward than the centre (fourth) bay, which is formed by an elevated entrance porch. This has lancet {{windows on the}} sides, grouped under single hood moulds and with a string course. The doorway is under a <b>segmental</b> <b>arch</b> which is topped by a gable. The rest of the ground floor has larger lancets arranged in pairs and with a small trefoil above. The south-facing walls have two pairs together, while on the inward-facing walls {{of the first and}} seventh bays there are two sets of paired windows placed some distance apart. At first-floor level, similar paired lancets and trefoils rise as gabled dormers above the roofline. The south walls of the first and seventh bays have prominent five-light oriel windows, canted to form a 1–3–1 pattern of trefoil-headed panes. These oriel windows are supported on ornate corbels. Above these at first-floor level, and also above the entrance porch, there are three-light trefoil-headed windows set under a segmental arch-shaped hood mould. Many of the windows on the south side have plate tracery.|$|E

25|$|The {{bridge with}} the flattest arches was the Trajan's Bridge, with a span-to-rise ratio of about 7to1. It also held several other {{important}} architectural records (see below). A number of fully stone <b>segmental</b> <b>arch</b> bridges, {{scattered throughout the}} empire, featured ratios of between 6.4 and 3, such as the relatively unknown Bridge at Limyra, the Ponte San Lorenzo and the Alconétar Bridge. By comparison, the Florentine Ponte Vecchio, {{one of the earliest}} <b>segmental</b> <b>arch</b> bridges in the Middle Ages, features a ratio of 5.3to1.|$|E
25|$|Although large Chinese {{bridges of}} wooden {{construction}} {{existed at the}} time of the Warring States, the oldest surviving stone bridge in China is the Zhaozhou Bridge, built from 595 to 605 AD during the Sui Dynasty. This bridge is also historically significant as it is the world's oldest open-spandrel stone <b>segmental</b> <b>arch</b> bridge. European <b>segmental</b> <b>arch</b> bridges date back to at least the Alconétar Bridge (approximately 2nd century AD), while the enormous Roman era Trajan's Bridge (105 AD) featured open-spandrel segmental arches in wooden construction.|$|E
25|$|The longest <b>segmental</b> <b>arch</b> {{bridge was}} the c. 1,100m long Trajan's Bridge, whose wooden {{superstructure}} {{was supported by}} twenty concrete piers. The Bridge at Limyra in modern-day Turkey, consisting of twenty-six flat brick arches, features the greatest lengths of all extant masonry structures in this category (360m).|$|E

25|$|Roman arch bridges {{were usually}} semicircular, {{although}} a few were segmental (such as Alconétar Bridge). A <b>segmental</b> <b>arch</b> is an arch that {{is less than a}} semicircle. The advantages of the <b>segmental</b> <b>arch</b> bridge were that it allowed great amounts of flood water to pass under it, which would prevent the bridge from being swept away during floods and the bridge itself could be more lightweight. Generally, Roman bridges featured wedge-shaped primary arch stones (voussoirs) of the same in size and shape. The Romans built both single spans and lengthy multiple arch aqueducts, such as the Pont du Gard and Segovia Aqueduct. Their bridges featured from an early time onwards flood openings in the piers, e.g. in the Pons Fabricius in Rome (62 BC), one of the world's oldest major bridges still standing.|$|E

25|$|Constructions {{such as the}} {{acclaimed}} Florentine <b>segmental</b> <b>arch</b> bridge Ponte Vecchio (1345) combined sound engineering (span-to-rise ratio of over 5.3 to 1) with aesthetical appeal. The three elegant arches of the Renaissance Ponte Santa Trinita (1569) constitute the oldest elliptic arch bridge worldwide. Such low rising structures required massive abutments, which at the Venetian Rialto bridge and the Fleischbrücke in Nuremberg (span-to-rise ratio 6.4:1) were founded on thousands of wooden piles, partly rammed obliquely into the grounds to counteract more effectively the lateral thrust.|$|E
25|$|The Romans also {{introduced}} <b>segmental</b> <b>arch</b> bridges into bridge construction. The 330m long Limyra Bridge in southwestern Turkey features 26 segmental arches {{with an average}} span-to-rise ratio of 5.3:1, giving the bridge an unusually flat profile unsurpassed {{for more than a}} millennium. Trajan's bridge over the Danube featured open-spandrel segmental arches made of wood (standing on 40m high concrete piers). This was to be the longest arch bridge for a thousand years both in terms of overall and individual span length, while the longest extant Roman bridge is the 790m long Puente Romano at Mérida.|$|E
25|$|The bridge {{carrying}} the London and Birmingham Railway over the London Road at Boxmoor in Hertfordshire, adjacent {{to what is}} now Hemel Hempstead station on the West Coast Main Line, {{is an example of a}} <b>segmental</b> <b>arch</b> of extreme obliquity that was designed by Buck and incorporates both of these features. Constructed in masonry, with a brick barrel, stone quoins and a 58° angle of skew, it was completed in 1837. Shortly before the railway opened the bridge was the subject of an ink and wash drawing dated 12 June 1837, one of a series of works by artist John Cooke Bourne illustrating the construction of the line.|$|E

The late Roman Karamagara Bridge in Cappadocia may represent the earliest surviving bridge featuring a pointed arch.|$|E
25|$|The {{bridge with}} the most slender piers was the three-span Ponte San Lorenzo in Padua, Italy. A {{favourable}} ratio between pier thickness and span is considered a particularly important parameter in bridge building, since wide openings reduce stream velocities which tend to undermine the foundations and cause collapse. The approximately 1.70m thick piers of the Ponte San Lorenzo are as slender as one-eighth of the span. In some Roman bridges, the ratio still reached one-fifth, but a common pier thickness was around {{one third of the}} span. Having been completed sometime between 47 and 30BC, the San Lorenzo Bridge also represents one of the earliest <b>segmental</b> <b>arch</b> bridges in the world with a span to rise ratio of 3.7to1.|$|E
25|$|The line {{crosses the}} White Water of Cart at Blackhall Bridge. This was {{originally}} an aqueduct, the River Cart Aqueduct, {{built for the}} Ardrossan Canal 1808 - 1810 {{under the direction of}} Thomas Telford. The contractor was John Simpson and the cost of construction was £5,440. It is a freestone masonry <b>segmental</b> <b>arch</b> of 88ft6in (27m) span and a height over the water of about 30feet (9m). The bridge is probably the longest span masonry aqueduct of the canal age on a British canal, and one of the world's earliest bridges carrying a public railway. It was widened to carry the double track railway, and the line crosses the bridge at a slight skew because of the easing of the sharp canal curvature.|$|E

50|$|The two Pulpits {{date from}} 1626, are of oak {{and of the}} same general design, set against the two {{responds}} of the chancel-arch, each of pentagonal form with a short flight of steps, base having a series of short turned balusters connected by <b>segmental</b> <b>arches</b> and capped by a cornice, the whole continued outwards as a rail to the stairs; upper part of pulpit, each face divided into two bays by turned columns with moulded bases and capitals from which spring <b>segmental</b> <b>arches</b> and the whole finished with an entablature; door similar but with one half-column only, between the bays and with strap-hinges; sounding-board resting on panelled standard at back with two attached pilasters; board finished with an entablature with <b>segmental</b> <b>arches</b> below and turned pendants, boarded soffit with turned pendant in middle.
