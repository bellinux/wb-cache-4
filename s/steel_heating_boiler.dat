50|$|Some {{experts that}} work with boilers {{on a day-to-day basis}} feel that {{electric}} boilers are actually superior to fuel <b>heated</b> <b>boilers</b> in a few ways. Those experts say that using electric boilers may actually be cheaper than using a fuel <b>heated</b> <b>boiler,</b> while also possibly being much more environmentally friendly. The electric boilers also require less equipment to be installed than a traditional boiler helping to reduce the high installation costs that will come with a fuel <b>heated</b> <b>boiler.</b> Electric Boilers can fit into smaller areas due to the way they are constructed and the lack of required parts that a fuel <b>heated</b> <b>boiler</b> requires to operate.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The waste <b>heat</b> <b>boiler</b> is an {{important}} part of waste heat power station in cement plant. So it is highly important to control the drum level of waste <b>heat</b> <b>boiler</b> within the allowed range. A double-stage fuzzy controller which is used to control the drum level of the waste <b>heat</b> <b>boiler</b> is presented in this paper. This method adds a secondary fuzzy controller to adjust the weight of the first fuzzy controller’s factor on the basis of a general fuzzy controller. Simulation results show that the double-stage fuzzy control system has fast respond speed, high precision and strong anti-jamming capability...|$|R
