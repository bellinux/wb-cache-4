5|$|The author {{explores the}} {{question}} of whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to media deemed inappropriate by adults (including violence and pornography), arguing that youths are not endangered by <b>sexually</b> <b>explicit</b> material. Heins asserts that there is no simple tactic by which the government can censor material from children without violating rights guaranteed adults by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. She points out that although the view of <b>sexually</b> <b>explicit</b> material's negative impact on children is unproven, the fear of its impact is used to support morality-based arguments; appeals to morality should not be a basis for censorship. Not in Front of the Children concludes that censorship under the auspices of protecting youth actually has the unintended consequence of harming them.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether exposure to sexualized media influences the subconscious process of attention allocation to subsequently encountered stimuli. One hundred twenty-three participants (61 females) between 18 - 23 years (M age = 19. 99 years) watched a 3 -minute video clip containing either neutral, <b>sexually</b> more <b>explicit,</b> or <b>sexually</b> less <b>explicit</b> imagery, before completing a dot detection task measuring selective attention for explicitly displayed sexual stimuli and a word search task measuring attention towards hidden sexual cues. Results of the dot detection task indicated that participants in all conditions were slower {{to detect the}} dot in trials including sexual stimuli, suggesting absorption by these stimuli. Results of the word search task indicated that participants in the two sexual video conditions, compared to participants in the neutral video condition, were quicker to detect a sexual word in the matrix, albeit only if they completed this task before the dot detection task. There were no differences {{in the number of}} sexual words found between video conditions. Our findings point out the importance of studying effects of sexualized media exposure on subconscious cognitive processes in young people, as such effects can provide us insights into how sexualized media content is processed and how sexual schemas are formed and strengthened...|$|R

5|$|Not in Front of the Children {{explores the}} {{development}} of U.S. case law with different standards of censorship for children and adults. The author describes a 1968 Supreme Court of the United States case, Ginsberg v. New York, where the court upheld a law preventing minors from viewing <b>sexually</b> <b>explicit</b> media. Sam Ginsberg and his wife managed a diner in Bellmore, New York. A mother sent her 16-year-old son to buy two adult magazines at the diner, creating a situation where Ginsberg would be prosecuted. Ginsberg was convicted of violating a New York State law which forbade selling magazines with pictures of nude women to minors.|$|E
5|$|The Spy Who Loved Me is {{the ninth}} novel in Ian Fleming's James Bond series, first {{published}} by Jonathan Cape on 16 April 1962. It {{is the shortest}} and most <b>sexually</b> <b>explicit</b> of Fleming's novels, {{as well as a}} clear departure from previous Bond novels in that the story is told in the first person by a young Canadian woman, Vivienne Michel. Bond himself does not appear until two-thirds of the way through the book. Fleming wrote a prologue to the novel giving Michel credit as a co-author.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Ginsberg's conviction, {{ruling that}} the New York State Legislature was not {{required}} to prove a tangible negative impact on youth from exposure to <b>sexually</b> <b>explicit</b> material. The Court said the New York State Legislature only needed to assume that such an impact existed. Justice William O. Douglas wrote a dissenting opinion in the case, criticizing the New York law. He concluded he knew individuals who fit the definition of juvenile delinquent but were fifty years old, and extrapolated {{the impact of the}} decision could be expanded to affect adults and multiple organizations in society instead of just youths.|$|E
40|$|Non-consensual {{dissemination}} of sexual images, often denoted as ‘revenge porn’, {{can be described}} as the act of distributing photos or videos depicting individuals in <b>sexually</b> suggestive or <b>explicit</b> circumstances without consent. The harmful impact can be felt both in the private and professional spheres of victims. Questions were raised across jurisdictions regarding the applicability of existing criminal law provisions or the need for legislative initiatives. After analysing the terminology and scope, this article examines three US state level dedicated laws, the amended UK Criminal Justice and Courts Act, and a dedicated provision in the Belgian Criminal Code. This analysis results in the identification of key elements that could serve as guidance for legislators to amend or adopt criminal legislation. Such provisions should include clearly delineated definitions, acknowledge that the lack of consent of the pictured person is the trigger for criminalisation, provide for relevant defences, and integrate sufficiently deterrent sanctions...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} several decades, {{there has been an}} {{increased}} focus on various forms of sexual violence and sexually aggressive behaviors (e. g., stalking, harassment). Technology has provided new opportunities for sexually aggressive behavior and involvement in sexting and revenge porn. To date, there is limited empirical research that exists on revenge porn- sending or posting <b>sexually</b> suggestive or <b>explicit</b> materials of a former lover, without the subject’s consent, in an attempt to humiliate, harass, or punish the victim. In the present exploratory study, we surveyed 470 college freshmen about their practices and perceptions about revenge porn. Findings revealed that approximately 10 % of the current sample had a private photo shared beyond the intended recipient and those male students and female students had different experiences. Specifically, victims of revenge porn were predominantly female, freshman, and 18 years of age and the majority of private pictures that were forwarded to others beyond the intended recipient were sent by a current or former boyfriend. Implications of these findings for the college community are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Kenzaburō Ōe has said, [...] "Yoko Ogawa {{is able to}} give {{expression}} to the most subtle workings of human psychology in prose that is gentle yet penetrating." [...] The subtlety in part {{lies in the fact}} that Ogawa's characters often seem not to know why they are doing what they are doing. She works by accumulation of detail, a technique that is perhaps more successful in her shorter works; the slow pace of development in the longer works requires something of a deus ex machina to end them. The reader is presented with an acute description of what the protagonists, mostly but not always female, observe and feel and their somewhat alienated self-observations, some of which is a reflection of Japanese society and especially women's roles within it. The tone of her works varies, across the works and sometimes within the longer works, from the surreal, through the grotesque and the —sometimes grotesquely— humorous, to the psychologically ambiguous and even disturbing. (Hotel Iris, one of her longer works, is more <b>explicit</b> <b>sexually</b> than her other works and is also her most widely translated.) ...|$|R
5|$|The {{narrative}} is episodic and usually focuses on one character at a time. Each {{of the first}} four episodes focuses {{on one of the}} four main characters, depicting social interaction and growth. The anime's use of time travel allows focus on the older versions or children of previously-featured characters, and contrasts their experiences with the protagonists' agelessness. Reviewers have experienced difficulty categorizing the Popotan anime, though it does feature an overall comedic tone. The characters are very lighthearted and eager to help new acquaintances. Nudity appears in many episodes, though no <b>sexually</b> <b>explicit</b> scenes occur. Geneon rated the series for ages 16+; Section23 Films gave its re-release a TV-MA rating.|$|E
5|$|Heins {{demonstrates}} how lawmakers {{in other states}} used the Ginsberg v. New York ruling to increase morality-based censorship of material from children. A year after the ruling, an Ohio court determined that Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest was inappropriate for youth. The author explains the dangers in allowing the government to determine appropriate material for youth to view, {{pointing out that the}} belief in <b>sexually</b> <b>explicit</b> material's negative impact on children is unproven. Heins notes that the fear of this impact is used to support morality-based arguments, and appeals to morality should not be a basis for censorship.

5|$|Heins {{examines}} {{the question of}} whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to violence and pornography, contending that youth are not endangered by <b>sexually</b> <b>explicit</b> material. She believes that censorship of such material from adolescents is {{based on the idea that}} minors are innocent and exposure to inappropriate media would corrupt them, explaining how this belief has been used as a basis for censorship. Heins explores whether the government or parents should restrict children's access to potentially inappropriate material, believing that the decision should rest primarily with parents. She writes that there is no simple tactic by which government can censor material from children without violating First-Amendment rights guaranteed to adults. Heins warns that attempting to categorize forms of creative expression in order to prohibit particular works of art results in censorship choices which reflect an ideological point-of-view.|$|E
40|$|Critics {{of sexual}} {{conflict}} theory argue that females may gain a net reproductive benefit from mating with manipulative males because the direct costs that they suffer may {{be offset by}} the production of sexy, i. e. manipulative, sons. However, this exclusive focus on nuclear gene effects represents an incomplete view of female fitness. Females differ fundamentally from males in transmitting not only nuclear genes but also {{a wide range of}} cytoplasmic genetic elements (CGEs) that can have profound effects, from male killing to influencing development of the nervous system and cognitive ability. Maternal transmission of CGEs has two major implications for sexual selection. First, the evolution of male fitness traits, such as sperm competitive ability, may be constrained because response to selection on mitochondrial genomes can occur only through the female line. Second, CGEs bear the direct costs of male manipulation but gain no indirect benefits when females produce sexy sons. This should result in perpetual antagonistic coevolution between nuclear genes involved in male manipulation and CGEs that promote female resistance to male <b>sexually</b> selected traits. <b>Explicit</b> consideration of the consequences of selection acting on CGEs is therefore necessary for {{a better understanding of the}} relationship between sexual selection and sexual conflict...|$|R
500|$|In 1992, Madonna {{starred in}} A League of Their Own as Mae Mordabito, a {{baseball}} player on an all-women's team. It reached {{number one on the}} box-office and became the tenth highest-grossing film {{of the year in the}} U.S. She recorded the film's theme song, [...] "This Used to Be My Playground", which became her tenth Hot 100 number-one hit, the most by any female artist at the time. The same year, she founded her own entertainment company, Maverick, consisting of a record company (Maverick Records), a film production company (Maverick Films), and associated music publishing, television broadcasting, book publishing and merchandising divisions. The deal was a joint venture with Time Warner and paid Madonna an advance of $60 million. It gave her 20% royalties from the music proceedings, the highest rate in the industry at the time, equaled only by Michael Jackson's royalty rate established a year earlier with Sony. The first release from the venture was Madonna's book, titled Sex. It consisted of <b>sexually</b> provocative and <b>explicit</b> images, photographed by Steven Meisel. The book received strong negative reaction from the media and the general public, but sold 1.5 million copies at $50 each in a matter of days. The backlash overshadowed Madonna's fifth studio album, Erotica, which was released at the same time. Despite positive reviews, it became her first studio album since her debut album not to score any chart-topper in the U.S. The album entered the Billboard 200 at number two and yielded the Hot 100 top-ten hits [...] "Erotica" [...] and [...] "Deeper and Deeper".|$|R
40|$|Background and aimsSending and {{receiving}} <b>sexually</b> suggestive or <b>explicit</b> images or texts (sexting) {{have been shown}} to be associated with health risk behaviors but literature about this phenomenon is scarce in Nigeria. This study looked at the prevalence, predictors, and associated sexual risk behaviors of sexting among postsecondary school young persons in Ibadan, Nigeria. MethodsThis was a cross-sectional study using a self-administered questionnaire. Data were obtained for sociodemographic characteristics and sexual orientation, sexting behavior, personality assessment (using the International Personality Item Pool Big-Five factor markers), indicators for problematic phone use (using Mobile Phone Problem Use Scale), and sexual behavior. Chi square test and logistic regression were used for data analysis with p[*]=[*] 0. 05. ResultsFive hundred seventy-five participants were recruited, age range 14 – 24 [*]years, and 46. 0 % were males. Twenty percent had sent sexts, while 33. 2 % had received sexts. Fifty-four percent had high scores in extraversion, 46. 5 % had moderate–severe problematic phone use. Sixteen percent had ever had sex, and 40. 0 % of these had multiple sexual partners. Males were more likely than females to have sent sexts (OR[*]=[*] 2. 67, 95 % CI: 1. 68 – 4. 24). Having a high extraversion score (OR[*]=[*] 2. 44, 95 % CI: 1. 35 – 4. 41) and moderate–severe problematic phone use (OR[*]=[*] 5. 56, 95 % CI: 2. 73 – 11. 32) was predictive of sexting. Sending {{and receiving}} of sext were significantly associated with ever having sexual intercourse (OR[*]=[*] 4. 01, 95 % CI: 2. 25 – 7. 17 and OR[*]=[*] 2. 96, 95 % CI: 1. 72 – 5. 12, respectively). ConclusionSexting was prevalent among postsecondary school young persons in Ibadan and was associated with male sex and problematic phone use. Intervention targeted at the identified susceptible group of young people may reduce its associated problems in this study group...|$|R

5|$|The next day, Rakesh tells Raj about {{a defect}} in the company's new mobile handset: a call goes to two people simultaneously—the {{intended}} recipient and another random person on the phone's contact list. Raj needs Sonia's permission to stop production, and she invites him to her house to discuss the matter. Sonia makes provocative and <b>sexually</b> <b>explicit</b> statements to Raj, who ignores her. She then aggressively tries to pursue Raj, who resists. Although he repeatedly rejects her advances, Sonia continues trying to seduce him. As he leaves, Sonia threatens to punish him for spurning her.

Cyrus returned to a more wholesome image with her sixth studio album Younger Now (2017).|$|E
5|$|The less {{stringent}} {{rules of}} the post-Hayes film industry allowed sexuality to be more open, and cinema as a whole became more <b>sexually</b> <b>explicit</b> from the 1980s in particular, but aimed to purely to entertain rather than exploring underlying sexual dynamics. Much of the sex in speculative fiction film is merely intended to titillate; a review of fantasy films identified 10–15% as softcore pornography. but it remained rare to see gay characters in speculative fiction films. Horror films, that had sex {{as one of their}} major preoccupations, continued to be more leniently censored, due to the perception of being unserious and lightweight. Vampires in particular have been described as obvious erotic metaphors and as a result, numerous vampire films since the 1970s strongly imply or explicitly show lesbianism, following the inspiration of lesbian vampire story Carmilla. The prototypical Hollywood vampire, Dracula, was shown to be openly gay in the spoof film Does Dracula Suck? in 1969.|$|E
