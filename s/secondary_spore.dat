50|$|Secondary {{dispersal}} {{through the}} formation of secondary spores is a survival mechanism exhibited by C. coronatus. This mechanism consists of the first spore producing a <b>secondary</b> <b>spore</b> if it lands on a nutritionally unfavourable medium, this <b>secondary</b> <b>spore</b> then gets discharged onto a different spot on the medium, or onto a completely different medium, in hopes of greater nutrient availability. These secondary, replicative spores are globose and elongate in physiology. Once the spore has been discharged, all subsequent developmental events are triggered, including germination. Sporangial germination, either through <b>secondary</b> <b>spore</b> formation or vegetative germ tube formation, seems to be increasingly dependent on the time elapsed since discharge, {{rather than on the}} external environmental factors, however these external factors do still play a role. The spores formed by C. coronatus during asexual reproduction are globose, villose and multiplicative in some isolates, and have at least seven nuclei per spore. This presence of villose and multiplicative spores is what differentiates C. coronatus from the genus Entomophthora. Though C.coronatus is classified under Zygomycota, it does not produce produce zygospores and therefore does not undergo sexual reproduction.|$|E
50|$|Bacillus odysseyi is a Gram-positive, aerobic, rod-shaped, round-spore- and endospore-forming {{eubacterium}} of the Bacillus genus. This novel {{species was}} discovered by scientist Myron T.

50|$|C. coronatus re{{produces}} asexually {{and produces}} thin-walled hyphae which occur singly or in clusters, {{with very few}} septa. At times, the hyphae will demonstrate an eosinophilic halo surrounding their edges, this halo has been termed the Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon. C. coronatus hyphae can easily be visualized when hematoxylin and eosin staining is performed, however they cannot be visualized via PAS or silver staining. The hyphae have unbranched sporangia, {{and some of these}} round sporangia exhibit short extensions, aptly named <b>secondary</b> <b>spores.</b> The single celled round sporangia, as well as the <b>secondary</b> <b>spores,</b> get ejected from the short sporangiophores, and they can travel up to 30mm upon ejection. If the medium the sporangia and spores land on is nutrient-dense, they will germinate and form one or more hyphal tubes, and the fungus will then continue its development and growth. Conidiobolus has three possible developmental pathways: (i) the fungus can remain in reproductive mode and form one or more <b>secondary</b> <b>spores,</b> (ii) the fungus may form a vegetative germ tube or (iii) it may not germinate at all. If the sporangia germinate through the development of a vegetative germ tube, the germ tube will then develop into a mycelium and go on to produce many sporangia and sporangiospores. If the fungus germinates through the formation of <b>secondary</b> <b>spores,</b> these <b>secondary</b> <b>spores</b> will usually be slightly smaller than the parent <b>spores.</b> The <b>secondary</b> <b>spores</b> may also go on to produce many smaller microspores. In young cultures, the C. coronatus spores have a smooth appearance, however as they mature, the spores gradually become covered with short hair like projections called villi. The presence of villi is characteristic of C. coronatus. Growth of the fungus in vivo shows a histologic pattern similar to that seen in other Zygomycota infections.|$|R
50|$|C. coronatus {{produces}} forcibly discharged sporangia, {{which show}} phototropic orientation. Phototropic orientation aims growth and spore dispersal towards {{the most intense}} light source, thereby increasing the efficiency of dispersal. This orientation towards the most intense light source {{can also be seen}} as a survival mechanism for the fungus as it increases the possibility that the sporangia will be dispersed in the least obstructed direction and to the greatest distance. The forcible discharge is affected {{by the size of the}} <b>spore,</b> with smaller <b>secondary</b> <b>spores</b> being discharged to greater distances and therefore having a greater chance at becoming air borne and landing on a medium that is nutritionally favourable for fungal growth. The growing zone of C. coronatus shows a light-mediated reorganization, with a weakness and thinning of the cell wall being seen in the area of future growth. Both primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>spores</b> of C. coronatus show phototropic orientation, however it is imprecise and becomes increasingly imprecise the greater the lights' angle of incidence. Upon further observation of the imprecise phototropic orientation, it can be seen that the sporangia seem to aim their dispersal above the source of light, which may be a compensation mechanism to assure that the fungus has the ability to disperse at the greatest possible distance, while maintaining its dispersal orientation towards the light. Though the fungus shows phototropic orientation, albeit imprecise, the formation and discharge of <b>secondary</b> <b>spores</b> is shown to occur in darkness as well, however it seems to always requires high moisture levels.|$|R

40|$|The {{germination}} and penetration {{processes of}} Erynia radicans on fifth instar Empoasca fabae nymphs at 20 °C, 100 % relative humidity, were investigated by scanning electron and fluorescence microscopy. Oval {{primary and secondary}} conidia attached to the host cuticle and germinated rapidly (60 % within 2 hr). While percentage germination did not differ on the three body regions of the host, significant differences were observed in the modes of germination. The percentage of spores that produced germ tubes increased from 10 % on the leafhopper head to 13 % on the thorax and 22 % on the abdomen, while capilliconidiophore production decreased from 88 to 84 to 71 % on the respective body regions. Hyphae from spores deposited on sclerites displayed strong directional growth toward interscleral membranes, especially on the host abdomen. Penetration of the cuticle was effected by formation of appressoria. Small, globular appressoria were formed immediately adjacent to spores or on short, nonseptate germ tubes, while large, elongate appressoria were produced usually on long, but occasionally on short, septate hyphae. Approximately 3 % of penetrations occurred on the leafhopper head, 16 % on the thorax, and 74 % on the abdomen; ca. 61 % of all penetrations occurred through membranes, especially in the intersegmental folds of the abdomen. Earliest penetrations were observed 3 – 4 hr after inoculation, but significant numbers of penetrations were not observed until after 6 hr. The number of penetrations on individual leafhoppers was largely independent of dose (mean r 2 = 0. 174), indicating substantial variability in susceptibility of individual leafhoppers. The percentage of viable oval conidia which ultimately gave rise to penetrations (either directly or indirectly via <b>secondary</b> <b>spore</b> production) was ca. 5 % after 10 – 12 hr and 20 % after 48 hr. The percentage of leafhoppers infected (percentage penetrated {{by one or more}} hyphae from a mean dose of 41 spores per insect) increased rapidly from only 2. 4 % at 4 hr postinoculation to ca. 60 % after 8 hr.

5000|$|This fungus overwinters in {{dead leaves}} on the ground. In early spring (about petal fall), fungal fruiting bodies called apothecia develop in these leaves. Spores (ascospores) are {{produced}} in the apothecia and are forcibly discharged starting at petal fall. These ascospores are spread by wind or rain to the healthy, new, green leaves and thus serve as the primary inoculum in a new growing season. The ascospores can stick to the leaf and if a film of water and optimal temperature is present, germinate within hours of adhesion. Upon germination, the ascospores can enter the leaf through the stomata (natural openings) {{on the underside of}} the leaf. [...] Ascospores cannot enter immature stomata very effectively. [...] These ascospores grow in the intercellular spaces in the leaf. Incubation time will vary depending on the amount of available moisture and temperatures.

40|$|Two {{pathogens}} Septoria pistaciarum and S. pistacina, causing {{leaf spot}} diseases of Pistachio (Pistacia vera) were studied. The morphology and ultrastructure {{of the two}} pathogens and also the ultrastructure of the host-pathogen interface were investigated. The conidia spores of both pathogens were narrowly elongate with several transverse septae and each cell contained one nucleus. Spore length and cell number were positively correlated. Spore germination was shown in detail in S. pistaciarum. Spore germination, initially an increase in volume followed {{by an increase in}} length by cell division, and germination by the production of twin-pairs of <b>secondary</b> septate <b>spores</b> and/or hyphal germ tubes. A pattern of cell division, polarity and germination was established and an interactive model was described. The spore growth initially followed linear kinetics and then became exponential. The production of hyphal tips hecame continuous exponential {{at the same time and}} the hyphal growth unit stabilised at 40 - 60 urn. The germination pattern could be altered by manipulation of the nitrogen or phosphate source and levels in the medium. In the resting spore the wall was composed of three layers an outer layer (o) and two inner layers I 1 and I 2. Each primary septum was a duplex layer derived from I 1 and I 2 with an intermediate electron lucent layer. Perforation was simple with paired Woronin bodies. During increase in lengththe development of new (secondary) septa showed the crosswall material was derived from layer I 2 and development was centripetal. The germ-tube wall was formed from wall layer I 2 and wall layers 0 + I 1 were disrupted. <b>Secondary</b> <b>spores</b> were formed enter oblastically. S. pistaciarum and S. pistacina were used in the ultrastructure of host-pathogen investigation, infection of the host by S. pistaciarum was by inoculation with conidia produced on culture whereas with S. pistacina inoculation was obtained from previously infected leaves. The spores germinated on the leaf surface and penetration was made by fine hyphae through the stomatal aperture in both species, growth of pathogen within the leaf was limited to the intercellular spaces. Penetration of the host cell wall did not occur. The hyphae were attached to mesophyll and palisade cells by an accumulation of extra-hyphal sheathing material.

50|$|At room {{temperature}} (25-30°C), colonies of B. ranarum show very rapid growth {{and are able}} to reach a diameter of 75-80 mm in a week on suitable growth media. The favored carbohydrate source of this fungus is glucose that can stimulate the growth of its mycelium. Generally, asexual reproduction is favored by glucose and sexual reproduction is favored by acid amines. Primary asexual spores are singly formed on the apices of unbranched hyphae and will then be discharged to form ballistic <b>spores.</b> <b>Secondary</b> asexual <b>spores</b> are singly developed from a hypha that was generated from a geminated ballistic spore. Also, sporangiospores can be generated by internal cleave of the cytoplasm and can then be dispersed when the sporangial wall is dissolved. As a result, the ejected asexual spores can form satellite colonies in a distance. After around 10 days of growth, sexual spores, zygospores with 20-50 μm diameters can also be produced. This fungus is believed to have significant protease and lipase activity. Its lipase has a maximum activity at 35°C and pH 6.0 while its protease has maximum activity at 30°C and pH 5.5. Both enzymes might be involved in pathogenesis. Light does not affect hyphal growth light but may influence certain aspects of physiology. First, light may stimulate the production of the asexual spores, and certain blue lights (wavelengths 440 nm and 480 nm) may further stimulate the discharge of the those spores. Second, light may also stimulate the induction of aerial hyphae and favor the unicellular configuration of the hyphae while darkness may favor their bicellular configuration.|$|R

50|$|Fungal {{growth is}} {{affected}} by the presence of optimal nutrients necessary for growth, by the presence of minerals, by temperature, by pH and by osmotic pressure. The presence of organic nutrients in the medium that C. coronatus finds itself in favors the formation of vegetative germ tubes, with glucose inducing vegetative germ growth far more effectively than asparagine. In terms of necessary nutrients for growth and survival, glucose and trehalose are both good sources of carbon for C. coronatus, other adequate sources of carbon are fructose, mannose, maltose, glycerol, oleate, stearate, palmitate and casamino acids, whereas galactose, starch and glycogen are all poor sources of carbon for C. coronatus. When looking at nitrogen, complex nitrogen sources seem to be best suited for optimal C. coronatus growth, however L-asparagine, ammonium salts, L-aspartic acid, glycine, L-alanine, L-serine, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and urea can all adequately be used by the fungus as nitrogen sources to varying extents. This fungus is unable to utilize nitrate as a nitrogen source. Certain minerals are able to stimulate fungal growth, for C. coronatus these minerals are Magnesium and Zinc. In terms of temperature effects on fungal growth, the temperature at which C. coronatus growth is at an optimal stage on agar is 27 °C, and the minimum temperature at which it is able to grow on agar is 6 °C. Though there is no growth seen below 6 °C, good survival of C. coronatus has been demonstrated at temperatures of 1 °C. Finally, the maximum growth temperature of C. coronatus on agar is 33 °C, this maximum growth temperature increases to 40 °C when the fungus is grown in liquid culture.In terms of pH effects on C. coronatus, the optimal pH broad range of growth for this fungus is pH 5.5 to pH 7, however sub-optimal growth can occur anywhere within the range of pH 3.5 to pH 8. In terms of pH dependent physiology, there is more frequent production of germ tubes on mildly acidic or neutral media (range of pH 5 to pH 7) with the greatest percent of germination occurring at pH 5. In addition, the percentage of <b>spores</b> that produce <b>secondary</b> <b>spores</b> is far greater on acidic media than on both neutral and basic media. In addition to organic nutrient and mineral presence, temperature and pH, osmotic pressure also has an effect on C. coronatus growth and dispersal. The spores of this fungus are more likely to germinate at lower osmotic pressures, and any medium with osmotic pressures greater than 10 atm will almost entirely inhibit germination of this fungus.|$|R

Low resistance was associated with high tolerance, as in the Lancaster and Sheffield populations, while high resistance was associated with low tolerance, as in the Arnhem population. The evolutionary significance of these associations is discussed. [KEYWORDS: RUST, RESISTANCE, TOLERANCE, TUSSILAGO FARFAVA, COLEOSPORIUM TUSSILAGINIS...|$|R
5000|$|Once these lesions {{from the}} primary {{infection}} have formed, there {{is the potential for}} secondary infections. <b>Secondary</b> or summer <b>spores</b> called conidia will form {{on the underside of the}} leaf from slightly concaved eruptions called acervuli. These conidia are horn-shaped and highly water-soluble. The spores have a whitish appearance on the underside of the leaf. They are spread via wind or rain when broken open and can cause additional infections. [...] Each of these spores can multiply and cause thousands of additional conidia to be produced in a relatively short amount of time. All of these conidia hold exactly the same genetic information and is simply the fungus just replicating its DNA. [...] At this stage the fungal infection overwhelms the host plant and causes the plant to shed its leaves prematurely. The leaf litter produced then becomes the overwintering site of this fungus, and the cycle will begin the next spring. These secondary infections allow the disease to escalate into an epidemic very quickly.|$|R

Developing and mature plasmodia were detected on the gills exclusively in the spring. The Myxobolus intimus infection was found only in 2 - to 3 -year-old fish. In histological sections, young plasmodia were found in capillaries of the secondary lamellae. More mature, round plasmodia 0. 4 – 0. 6 mm in diameter, deformed the respiratory lamellae. The intraoligochaete development of M. intimus was studied in experimentally infected oligochaetes. In two experi-ments, uninfected Tubifex tubifex Müller and Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri (Claparède) were exposed to mature myxospores of M. intimus. In both experiments, typical triactinospores developed in T. tubifex specimens but no infection was found in L. hoffmeisteri. In semithin sections, developmental stages, pansporocysts and actinospores, were found within the proliferated gut epithelium of T. tubifex. Triactinospores were first released from oligochaetes 37 and 58 days after initial exposure in the two experiments, respectively. Each triactinospore had three pyriform polar capsules and a cylindrical sporoplasm with 32 <b>secondary</b> cells. The <b>spore</b> body joined the 3 caudal projections with a moderately long style.

40|$|The {{development}} of Myxobolus dispar Thelohan, 1895, a myxosporean parasite of the gills of common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) was studied in experimentally infected oligochaetes Tubifex tubifex Muller. After infection of uninfected tubificids with mature spores of M. dispar {{development of}} actinosporean stages was first observed light microscopically 21 days after initial exposure. In histological sections, early pansporocysts {{were located in}} the gut epithelium of experimental oligochaetes, while advanced stages occupied mostly the outer layers of the gut and the coelozoic space. Mature pansporocysts, each containing 8 raabeia spores, appeared 199 days after initial exposure. Following damage of the intestinal wall and rupture of the pansporocysts, free actinosporean stages {{were found in the}} gut lumen of the oligochaetes. Actinospores of M. dispar emerged from the worms after 217 days of intra-oligochaete development. They were floating in the water and showed a unique raabeia form. Each raabeia sport had three pyriform polar capsules and a cylindrical-shaped sporoplasm with approximately 32 <b>secondary</b> cells. The <b>spore</b> body joined the three caudal projections without a style. Caudal projections were bifurcated at the end and the two main branches had further small bifurcations. The total length of the raabeia sport was approximately 158 mu m. The prevalence of infection in 240 experimentally infected Tubifex specimens was 99. 2 %. No infection was found in the control oligochaetes...|$|R
40|$|In Cameroon, cocoa {{trees are}} mostly grown in forests and without fertilization. Our {{aim was to}} learn more about the {{temporal}} dynamics of soils in cocoa agroforests by comparing young (1 - 4 years old) and old (over 25 years old) cocoa agroforests. Short fallow and secondary forest were used as treeless and forest references. The numbers and diversities of soil vesicular arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi on 60 cocoa producing farms in the Central province of Cameroon were assessed based on the classical morphotyping of spore morphology. We also observed the soil organic matter, nitrogen and major soil nutrients. VAM spore density was significantly lower in the young cocoa agroforests (16 spores g- 1 dry soil) than in the old cocoa agroforests (36 spores g- 1 dry soil). Levels in the nearby <b>secondary</b> forest (46 <b>spores</b> g- 1 dry soil) were not significantly different from old cocoa. The spore density was significantly highest in the short fallow (98 spores g- 1 dry soil). The Shannon- Weaver index also showed significantly lower biodiversity in young cocoa (0. 39) than in old cocoa agroforests (0. 48), secondary forest (0. 49) and short fallow (0. 47). These observations were supported by significant differences in the C:N ratio, Ca, Mg, and cation exchange capacity between young and old cocoa agroforests. We concluded that unfertilized cocoa agroforests could be sustainable, despite a decrease in some soil characteristics at a young stage, due to traditional land-conversion practices based on selective clearing and burning of secondary forest.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} and measure areas of physiology relevant to the initiation of <b>secondary</b> metabolism and <b>spore</b> formation. It was discovered that the growth kinetics of Saccharopolyspora erythraea in a liquid culture environment were dependent on the type of nutrient limitation the organism was exposed to. Sacc. erythraea was able to produce erythromycin and formed structures which had properties similar to those of spores (designated 'sonic resistant units' in this thesis) in a nitrogen limited medium but, would produce erythromycin but no 'sonic resistant units' in a carbon limited medium. This resulted in two liquid culture systems, one which supported the formation of 'sonic resistant units' and one which did not, and thus enabled the comparison of the conditions which resulted in sporulation or secondary metabolism. The measurement of the rate of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis showed distinct profiles of synthesis in both media. Measurements of these rates in Streptomyces hygroscopicus showed similar profiles in the same media suggesting that the behaviour of the macromolecular synthesis rates in different nutrient limiting conditions might be applicable to streptomycetes in general. A change in macromolecular synthesis rate was implicated in inducing secondary metabolism. Antibiotics were used to modulate these rates in an attempt to induce secondary metabolism. Results from these experiments suggested the possible role of the intracellular concentration of charged and uncharged tRNA in induction of antibiotic synthesis. This relationship implies an analogy between the stringent response and the physiology of the induction of secondary metabolism. The formation of spores ('sonic resistant units') did not appear to be induced by changes in macromolecular synthesis rate or changes in tRNA levels or ratio. However, it was evident that the rates of macromolecular synthesis increased during the production of spores and this implied that it is the action of some intracellular agent that is inducing macromolecular synthesis to fuel the spore forming process...|$|R
