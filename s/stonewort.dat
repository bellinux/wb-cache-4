25|$|Biddle Street {{has been}} {{designated}} as a Site of Special Scientific Interest where management practices and the variation in the soils {{has resulted in the}} watercourses supporting a wide range of aquatic plant communities. Where open water occurs plants such as common water-starwort (Callitriche stagnalis), European frogbit (Hydrocharis morsusranae), fan-leaved water-crowfoot (Ranunculus circinatus). The calcareous influence of the underlying Compton soils also encourages whorled water-milfoil (Myriophyllum verticillatum) and <b>stonewort</b> (Chara sp). Also present are the nationally scarce rootless duckweed (Wolffia arrhiza) and hairlike pondweed (Potamogeton trichoides).|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} nationally local or rare species of plant have been {{recorded}} from the site including Fen pondweed, several species of <b>stonewort</b> including the rare dwarf <b>stonewort,</b> olive earthtongue fungus, Fen pondweed, Narrow-leaved marsh orchid and Fly orchid ...|$|E

50|$|The lakes are a Special Area of Conservation with white-clawed {{crayfish}} and Chara, or <b>stonewort,</b> as {{features of}} interest.|$|E
5000|$|The {{stock of}} crayfishes is undocumented, but fishing using {{a maximum of}} ten tools is allowed with a fishing license. [...] Aquatic {{vegetation}} is dominated by Fragile <b>Stonewort.</b>|$|E
40|$|The great {{flat slab}} {{on which we}} stood seemed built there to command a view of <b>stoneworts.</b> In the clear lime water of Fall River, S. D., floated great {{streamers}} of Chara, fresh and green, yet fading insensibly, first into a dingy, then into a dead looking, and even into a stony mass, as the eye followed it up stream. It was a streamer of living, growing <b>stoneworts</b> that blended into the slabs of 2 ̆ 2 petrified moss 2 ̆ 2 strewn broadcast in the channel around us, and on one of which we stood. But the eye could trace this so-called living fossil or petrifaction back still further to the banks overhead, where other <b>stoneworts</b> once floated in waters whose channel was higher than and broader than now. Yet higher still, in an earlier channel, {{the eye could see}} great slabs of it, upturned in a railroad cutting...|$|R
50|$|Charophytes such as Palaeonitella cranii and {{possibly}} the yet unassigned Parka decipiens {{are present in the}} fossil record of the Devonian. Palaeonitella differed little from some present-day <b>stoneworts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Notwithstanding its eutrophication, the {{presence}} of <b>Stoneworts</b> in Fatburen indicates the waters have a relatively high visibility, which, considering {{it is the last}} lake in the lake system, is surprising.|$|R
50|$|More shallow {{areas of}} the ponds contain mare's-tail (Hippuris vulgaris) and lesser water-parsnip (Berula erecta), grey willow (Salix cinerea); various-leaved {{water-starwort}} (Callitriche platycarpa), brackish water-crowfoot (Ranunculus baudotii) and <b>stonewort</b> (Chara vuloaris).|$|E
50|$|Nitella flexilis, {{the smooth}} <b>stonewort,</b> is a {{freshwater}} species of characean algae {{that is used}} as a model organism for its large cell size and relative ease of cultivation in the laboratory.|$|E
50|$|Stowe Pool {{has limited}} {{marginal}} vegetation, but its water plants include Polygonum amphibium and spiked water-milfoil. The shallow {{margins of the}} pool are dominated by extensive low-growing blankets of the water plant Chara aspera var. curta a nationally scarce <b>stonewort.</b>|$|E
50|$|Charophyta sensu lato, as used by Adl et al., is a {{monophyletic}} {{group which}} {{is made up of}} some green algae, including the <b>stoneworts</b> (Charophyta sensu stricto), as well as the land plants (embryophytes).|$|R
50|$|The lake {{supports}} {{a range of}} pondweeds that include Potamogeton perfoliatus and P. lucens, Canadian pondweed (Elodea canadensis), {{and a variety of}} <b>stoneworts</b> (Chara spp., such as C. pedunculata and C. curta) which are marl or hard-water lake indicators.|$|R
5000|$|The {{other group}} within the Viridiplantae are the mainly {{freshwater}} or terrestrial Streptophyta, {{which consists of}} the land plants together with the Charophyta, itself consisting of several groups of green algae such as the desmids and <b>stoneworts.</b> Streptophyte algae are either unicellular or form multicellular filaments, branched or unbranched. The genus Spirogyra is a filamentous streptophyte alga familiar to many, as it is often used in teaching {{and is one of}} the organisms responsible for the algal [...] "scum" [...] that pond-owners so dislike. The freshwater <b>stoneworts</b> strongly resemble land plants and are believed to be their closest relatives. Growing in fresh water, they consist of a central stalk with whorls of branchlets, giving them a superficial resemblance to horsetails, species of the genus Equisetum, which are true land plants.|$|R
50|$|The {{aquatic flora}} of the estuary are {{dominated}} by the small green algae Polyphysa peniculus the <b>stonewort</b> Lamprothamnium papulosum and the seagrass Ruppia megacarpa.The waterbody of the inlet is fringed with Salt Water Paperbarks with sedges and samphire common along the sandy sections.|$|E
50|$|The {{reservoir}} {{is listed}} as a Site of Nature Conservation Interest (SNCI) as it has pondweed and <b>stonewort,</b> and common toads breed there. The grassland and scrub surrounding the reservoir is also an SNCI due to the grass snakes and slowworms there.|$|E
50|$|Notable plants {{include the}} fen violet, great fen sedge Cladium mariscus, marsh pea, greater spearwort, marsh orchids and milk parsley. There {{are also a}} number of <b>stonewort</b> species present in the ditches and ponds, along with {{flowering}} rush, water millefoil, and yellow and white water lilies.|$|E
50|$|The Archaeplastida {{vary widely}} {{in the degree}} of their cell organization, from {{isolated}} cells to filaments to colonies to multi-celled organisms. The earliest were unicellular, and many groups remain so today. Multicellularity evolved separately in several groups, including red algae, ulvophyte green algae, and in the green algae that gave rise to <b>stoneworts</b> and land plants.|$|R
50|$|Charophyta is a {{division}} of freshwater green algae. The terrestrial plants, the Embryophyta emerged within Charophyta, with the class Zygnematophyceae as a sister group. With the cladistic inclusion of the Embryophyta, the Charophyta is synonymous with the Streptophyta. The sister group of the Charophytes are the Chlorophyta. Basal Chlorophyta are the Mesostigmatophyceae, the Chlorokybophyceae and an unnamed clade containing {{the remainder of the}} Charophyta. Some charophyte groups, such as Zygnematophyceae or conjugating green algae, flagella are absent and sexual reproduction does not involve free-swimming flagellate sperm. Flagellate sperm, however, are found in <b>stoneworts</b> (Charales) and Coleochaetales, orders of parenchymatous charophytes that are the closest relatives of the land plants, where flagellate sperm are also present in all except the conifers and flowering plants. Fossil <b>stoneworts</b> of Devonian age that {{are similar to those of}} the present day have been described from the Rhynie chert of Scotland.|$|R
5000|$|In 1939, Mason was {{appointed}} to the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) as an assistant botanist. Mason was the first to record Wolffia in New Zealand (in 1949) and her most long-standing research interest was in the freshwater algae commonly known as <b>stoneworts.</b> Her research also included establishing a seed herbarium, and identifying food preferences of moa through gizzard contents.|$|R
50|$|Originally grasses such as fennel pondweed, hornwort, pond water-crowfoot and <b>stonewort</b> used {{to occur}} in the lake. After they had {{disappeared}} in previous decades as a result of fertiliser discharge and subsequent loss of water quality, in recent years new colonies of these species have re-established themselves.|$|E
5000|$|This {{extensive}} area of disused brick clay workings has {{the largest}} known population in Britain of great crested newts. There are ten species of <b>stonewort,</b> including chara canescens, which was previously thought to be extinct in Britain, and four other nationally rare species. The habitats are diverse, with ponds, scrub and rough grassland.|$|E
50|$|Fish {{species in}} Kindrum Lough include brown trout, Arctic char, three-spined stickleback and the {{critically}} endangered European eel. Two rare plant {{species have been}} recorded from the lake: slender naiad (Najas flexilis) and a <b>stonewort,</b> Nitella spanioclema. The latter species is considered endemic to County Donegal. Kindrum Lough {{is part of the}} Kindrum Lough Special Area of Conservation.|$|E
50|$|The {{aquatic flora}} {{composed}} of reed, common club-rush, flowering rush, yellow iris, greater water-parsnip, brooklime, bulbous rush, toad rush, eight-stamened waterwort, needle spike-rush, spring quillwort, amphibious bistort, pale persicaria, rigid hornwort, horned pondweed, perfoliate pondweed, blunt-leaved pondweed, grass-wrack pondweed, fennel pondweed, various-leaved pondweed, lesser pondweed, fan-leaved water-goosefoot, whorled water-milfoil, alternate water-milfoil, spiked water-milfoil, Canadian waterweed, Nuttall's waterweed, and common duckweed. There are <b>stoneworts</b> such as Chara delicatula and Nitella flexilis.|$|R
50|$|Many botanists {{propose that}} the <b>stoneworts</b> and their {{relatives}} {{be placed in a}} division, sub-kingdom, or even kingdom by themselves, often named Charophyta. Their classification by taxonomists is currently undergoing much cladistic scrutiny. Further DNA and RNA analysis may prove the charophytes to be a crucial evolutionary link in the phylogenetic tree of life, the critical developmental step from the algae toward the non-vascular and then vascular land plants.|$|R
50|$|Most Characeae {{are found}} in fresh water, usually in still, clear water where they attach to the {{substrate}} by rhizoids. They can be pioneer colonizers or ephemerals. They are usually found in low to medium nutrient-rich water and tend to disappear due to eutrophication. Some <b>stoneworts</b> can survive in brackish or maritime habitats and occur in ephemeral saline lakes in Australia that have twice the salinity of seawater.|$|R
50|$|The pool {{provides}} a scarce habitat in Cornwall with rare species of algae, bryophytes and flowering plants. Aquatic plants include amphibious bistort (Persicaria amphibia), horned pondweed (Zannichellia palustris), perfoliate pondweed (Potamogeton perfoliatus), shore-weed (Littorella uniflora) and six-stamened waterwort (Elatine hexandra). In 1898 a <b>stonewort</b> (Nitella hyalina) was first discovered in Britain at Penrose Creek by Canon G R Bullock-Webster. The last record was in 1914.|$|E
50|$|Management {{practices}} and {{the variation in}} the soils {{has resulted in the}} watercourses supporting a wide range of aquatic plantcommunities. Where open water occurs plants such as Common Water-starwort (Callitriche stagnalis), European Frogbit (Hydrocharis morsusranae), Fan-leaved Water-crowfoot (Ranunculus circinatus). The calcareous influence of theunderlying Compton soils also encourages Whorled Water-milfoil (Myriophyllum verticillatum) and <b>Stonewort</b> (Chara sp). Also present are the nationally scarce Rootless Duckweed (Wolffia arrhiza) and Hairlike Pondweed (Potamogeton trichoides).|$|E
50|$|It has {{the largest}} reed-bed in England and {{supports}} rare waterweeds such as the holly-leaved naiad and three rare species of <b>stonewort.</b> Amongst the rare insects is the swallowtail butterfly which feeds on milk-parsley (Peucedanum palustre), the Norfolk hawker Aeshna isosceles and Emperor dragonfly. Birds that visit the reserve during the winter include cranes, goldeneyes, shovelers and teals, while bitterns, marsh harriers, pochards, water rails and Cetti's warblers stay {{for most of the}} year. There is a waymarked walk around the broad.|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} fossils {{attributed to}} green algae {{date from the}} Precambrian (ca. 1200 mya). The resistant outer walls of prasinophyte cysts (known as phycomata) are well preserved in fossil deposits of the Paleozoic (ca. 250-540 mya). A filamentous fossil (Proterocladus) from middle Neoproterozoic deposits (ca. 750 mya) {{has been attributed to}} the Cladophorales, while the oldest reliable records of the Bryopsidales, Dasycladales) and <b>stoneworts</b> are from the Paleozoic.|$|R
50|$|The {{vegetation}} of {{the delta}} mostly consists of thickets of reeds, grassweed, sedges, bur-reed and cattail. Less frequent are tape-grasses, grass rush, arrowhead and other water-hungry plants. The estuaries have rich underwater vegetation {{in the form of}} <b>stoneworts</b> algae, pondweed, hornworts, lilies and other species. The total area of such vegetation is 40000 to 50000 ha. Some estuaries contain thickets of lotus which was brought to the area from Africa.|$|R
5000|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{origins of}} the embryophytes are discussed further below, but they {{are believed to have}} evolved from within a group of complex green algae during the Paleozoic era (which started around [...] ). Charales or the <b>stoneworts</b> may be the best living illustration of that developmental step. Embryophytes are primarily adapted for life on land, although some are secondarily aquatic. Accordingly, they are often called land plants or terrestrial plants.|$|R
