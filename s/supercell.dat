5|$|<b>Supercell</b> (stylized as <b>supercell)</b> is an 11-member Japanese pop band led by {{musician}} and songwriter Ryo, which formed in 2007 as a d≈çjin music band. The other 10 members are artists and designers who provide illustrations in album booklets and music videos. <b>Supercell</b> started out by {{making use of}} the Hatsune Miku Vocaloid singing synthesizer to produce vocals for songs submitted to the Nico Nico Douga video sharing website. The popularity of the songs led the band to release their independent self-titled album <b>Supercell</b> (2008). <b>Supercell</b> later signed to Sony Music Entertainment Japan and had a professional release of their <b>Supercell</b> album in March 2009, which was updated with more songs.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 1 {{percent of}} tornadoes rotate in an {{anticyclonic}} {{direction in the}} northern hemisphere. Typically, systems as weak as landspouts and gustnadoes can rotate anticyclonically, and usually only those which form on the anticyclonic shear side of the descending rear flank downdraft (RFD) in a cyclonic <b>supercell.</b> On rare occasions, anticyclonic tornadoes form {{in association with the}} mesoanticyclone of an anticyclonic <b>supercell,</b> {{in the same manner as}} the typical cyclonic tornado, or as a companion tornado either as a satellite tornado or associated with anticyclonic eddies within a <b>supercell.</b>|$|E
5|$|Storm {{spotters}} {{are trained}} to discern whether a storm seen from a distance is a <b>supercell.</b> They typically look to its rear, the main region of updraft and inflow. Under the updraft is a rain-free base, and the next step of tornadogenesis is {{the formation of a}} rotating wall cloud. The vast majority of intense tornadoes occur with a wall cloud on the backside of a <b>supercell.</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 61 <b>supercells</b> with mesocyclones lasting {{for at least}} 6 volume scans were investigated. These storm parame ters and mesocyclone {{parameters}} were counted and compared to determine the salient differences between isolated su percells and embedded <b>supercells</b> in different regions. The {{results showed that the}} mesocyclone parameters had differ ent evolution characteristics in three stages of mesocyclone. The storm parameters, mesocyclone parameters and severe weather phenomenon had significantly differences between isolated <b>supercells</b> and embedded <b>supercells.</b> The mesocyc lone parameter differences determined the differences in the reflectivity structure and weather phenomenon. The higher base and top of mesocyclone for isolated <b>supercells</b> indicated that the isolated <b>supercells</b> had higher maximum reflecti vity, maximum reflectivity height, cell-based vertically integrated liquid and top of storm cell, and significantly higher probability of hail or large hail than the embedded <b>supercells.</b> The descending lower base of mesocyclone at its mature stage in the region of Jianghuai Plain indicated that the <b>supercells</b> in this region had a higher probability of mesocyc lone-induced tornado. </p...|$|R

5|$|At around 1:00pm CST (19:00UTC), a line {{of violent}} {{thunderstorms}} began developing near the Wichita Mountains in Comanche County, Oklahoma. The <b>supercell</b> that eventually produced the first tornado of the outbreak moved northeast through Caddo and Grady counties over the next 30 to 45 minutes, before reaching southeastern Canadian County at around 2:00pm CST (20:00UTC). By 2:14pm CST (20:14UTC), the line had formed a hook echo, which was fully developed four minutes later. Observers reported wall clouds from the Yukon area into western portions of Oklahoma City during the next 10to 15minutes. At 2:36pm CST (20:37UTC), the <b>supercell</b> produced a tornado near the Wiley Post Airport in Oklahoma City, causing damage at the Northwest Expressway. According to the Doppler weather radar, the hook continued {{to show signs of}} rotation as it moved northeast across Oklahoma County. At 2:52pm CST (20:52UTC), the <b>supercell</b> produced its second tornado on the northwestern side of Edmond which caused its most severe damage near the Oklahoma and Logan County line. The tornado dissipated north of the Logan County Line at 3:05pm CST (21:05UTC).|$|E
5|$|Four {{additional}} tornadoes {{touched down}} this day. A tornado that {{was associated with}} the main <b>supercell</b> touched down briefly near Fulda, Minnesota, at 3:55pm, while the Comfrey tornado was also on the ground. It was rated as an F1 and caused minor damage. Three other tornadoes that were all unrelated to the main <b>supercell</b> were confirmed as well; one in southeast Minnesota near Wabasha and two in Wisconsin. All three were rated F0 on the Fujita Scale and produced only minor damage.|$|E

50|$|<b>Supercells</b> {{are often}} put into three {{classification}} types: Classic, Low-precipitation (LP), and High-precipitation (HP). LP <b>supercells</b> are usually found in climates {{that are more}} arid, such as the high plains of the United States, and HP <b>supercells</b> are most often found in moist climates. <b>Supercells</b> can occur {{anywhere in the world}} under the right pre-existing weather conditions, but they are most common in the Great Plains of the United States in an area known as Tornado Alley and in the Tornado Corridor of Argentina, Uruguay and southern Brazil.|$|R
500|$|Tornadoes often develop from a {{class of}} {{thunderstorms}} known as <b>supercells.</b> <b>Supercells</b> contain mesocyclones, an area of organized rotation a few miles up in the atmosphere, usually [...] across. Most intense tornadoes (EF3 to EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale) develop from <b>supercells.</b> In addition to tornadoes, very heavy rain, frequent lightning, strong wind gusts, and hail are common in such storms.|$|R

5|$|The 2007 Groundhog Day tornado {{outbreak}} was a localized but devastating tornado {{event that}} took place in central Florida early on February 2, 2007. Early morning temperatures had risen well above average for the season; combined with increased moisture and a powerful jet stream, this created enough instability and wind shear for thunderstorms to rotate and spawn tornadoes. Due to the conditions, a long-tracked <b>supercell</b> formed and produced three tornadoes over one hour and seventeen minutes. The <b>supercell</b> resulted in a 70-mile (110-kilometer) trail of damage.|$|E
5|$|A quasi-linear {{complex of}} {{thunderstorms}} began developing near the Highway 81 corridor west of Oklahoma City between 4:00 and 4:45p.m.CDT, and rapidly reached severe intensity. At 5:33p.m.CDT (2233UTC), the National Weather Service Weather Forecast Office in Norman, Oklahoma issued a tornado warning for Canadian County, prompted by increasingly strong tornadic circulation {{exhibited in the}} southernmost <b>supercell</b> of this complex.|$|E
30|$|Calculations of {{electronic}} {{structure of the}} K-phase <b>supercells</b> of Fe-Al-C system, which consisted of several layers of the stoichiometric K-phase and one layer of the modified K-phase with additional carbon atom, have shown that only <b>supercells</b> with at least three or four intermediate layers are thermodynamically stable. <b>Supercells</b> with smaller number of layers require additional flow of heat and are unstable.|$|R
30|$|The {{minimum of}} pseudogap at the Fermi level of spin-down {{electrons}} in the <b>supercells</b> with {{one to two}} intermediate layers is indistinct. The Fermi level of the <b>supercells</b> with three to four layers does not fall on the minimum of densities of states, but the valence band peak is narrow. In general, all considered <b>supercells</b> are potentially unstable, same as Fe 3 AlC.|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} into <b>supercells</b> {{has focused on}} narrowing the number of important storm processes that lead to these storms. For years it has been known that <b>supercells</b> generally deviate slightly {{to the left or}} right of the mean wind, but that in some rare cases, <b>supercells</b> move in a very atypical direction.

5|$|After the Tuscaloosa/Birmingham tornado lifted, {{the same}} <b>supercell</b> {{produced}} another tornado, at 6:28p.m. CDT (2328 UTC) near Argo, Alabama, in eastern Jefferson County. It {{went on to}} devastate the rural community of Shoal Creek Valley, located between Ashville and Ragland in St. Clair County, Alabama.|$|E
5|$|As {{it entered}} Cleveland County, the National Weather Service and Storm Prediction Center {{activated}} emergency procedures, preparing to evacuate staff and others {{present at the}} facility {{in the event that}} the <b>supercell</b> should turn right, placing areas surrounding the Norman campus in the tornado's path (under NOAA protocol in situations posing a danger to personnel at local Weather Forecast Offices and related guidance centers, responsibility over the issuance of warnings and statements on the unfolding outbreak would have been transferred to the nearest NWS Forecast Office, based in Tulsa, while the SPC's forecasting responsibilities would {{be turned over to the}} 557th Weather Wing at Offutt Air Force Base). The <b>supercell,</b> however, continued on a northeastward track, sparing the Norman area.|$|E
5|$|Cindy's remnant low {{moving across}} western and {{northern}} North Carolina {{combined with a}} frontal boundary to produce several <b>supercell</b> thunderstorms. These supercells spawned a number of tornadoes in western North Carolina, at {{the foothills of the}} Appalachian mountains, but their effects were minimal. Continuing north, Cindy brought over 5in (125mm) of rain to areas as distant as Salisbury, Maryland.|$|E
50|$|Tornadoes often develop from a {{class of}} {{thunderstorms}} known as <b>supercells.</b> <b>Supercells</b> contain mesocyclones, an area of organized rotation a few miles up in the atmosphere, usually 1-6 miles (2-10 km) across. Most intense tornadoes (EF3 to EF5 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale) develop from <b>supercells.</b> In addition to tornadoes, very heavy rain, frequent lightning, strong wind gusts, and hail are common in such storms.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Supercells</b> {{are usually}} found {{isolated}} from other thunderstorms, although they {{can sometimes be}} embedded in a squall line. Typically, <b>supercells</b> {{are found in the}} warm sector of a low pressure system propagating generally in a north easterly direction in line with the cold front of the low pressure system. Because they can last for hours, they are known as quasi-steady-state storms. <b>Supercells</b> have the capability to deviate from the mean wind. If they track to the right or left of the mean wind (relative to the vertical wind shear), they are said to be [...] "right-movers" [...] or [...] "left-movers," [...] respectively. <b>Supercells</b> can sometimes develop two separate updrafts with opposing rotations, which splits the storm into two supercells: one left-mover and one right-mover.|$|R
5|$|The storm {{system that}} caused the tornado had {{produced}} severe weather, including two weak tornadoes, in eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey that morning. This was an unusual setup for a significant tornado, associated with a warm front near a low-pressure center. A thunderstorm cell formed south of Long Island around 10:20 am, and became a <b>supercell</b> sometime later after interacting with a surface low-pressure center. It turned north as a left-moving <b>supercell,</b> meaning it moved left {{with respect to the}} mean atmospheric flow. Left-moving supercells are very rare, as cyclonic storms usually turn {{to the right of the}} mean flow. It is unknown whether this leftward movement was due to an atmospheric interaction or terrain-induced movement, as the storm moved straight up the Connecticut River valley.|$|E
5|$|The {{thunderstorm}} {{that would}} eventually produce the infamous F3tornado in Fort Worth developed from a cluster of storms that formed west of the city. At 4:38p.m. CST (22:38UTC), a severe thunderstorm warning was issued on the quickly organizing storm for Parker County. About an hour later, another severe thunderstorm warning was issued, this time for Tarrant County, as the storm continued to track eastward. Radar imagery showed that the <b>supercell</b> was rapidly organizing, developing a bounded weak echo region and hook echo‚Äîradar signatures that hint at a strong and potentially tornadic thunderstorm‚Äîin less than a half-hour. Radar also indicated that a broad mesocyclone had developed by around 6:00p.m. CST (00:00 UTC), extending vertically through {{the entirety of the}} <b>supercell.</b> At around the same time, a wall cloud was spotted in association with the rotating thunderstorm while baseball-sized hail fell ahead of the rotation in northern Fort Worth along Interstate 820. Winds from the downdraft of another small thunderstorm south of Fort Worth allowed the strengthening <b>supercell</b> to organize further. At 6:10p.m. (00:10UTC), a tornado warning was issued for Tarrant County, and accordingly emergency sirens were activated in the Fort Worth a minute later.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} main types of thunderstorms: single-cell, {{multi-cell}}, squall line (also called multi-cell line) and <b>supercell.</b> Which type forms {{depends on the}} instability and relative wind conditions at different layers of the atmosphere ("wind shear"). Single-cell thunderstorms form in environments of low vertical wind shear and last only 20‚Äì30 minutes.|$|E
50|$|At {{the same}} time, <b>supercells</b> {{began to appear}} in Texas. One of these {{produced}} an EF4 wedge tornado which ripped through parts of Garland and Rowlett, Texas, causing major damage. As the storm complex began to move to the north, more <b>supercells</b> began to pop up with several more tornadoes being reported. By early on December 27, the <b>supercells</b> had begun to merge into a squall line, with tornado reports beginning to diminish, but occasionally a few isolated tornadoes would be produced by the storm.|$|R

5|$|Typically, {{if there}} is little wind shear, the storm will rapidly enter the dissipating stage and 'rain itself out', but, {{if there is}} {{sufficient}} change in wind speed and/or direction, the downdraft will {{be separated from the}} updraft, and the storm may become a <b>supercell,</b> where the mature stage can sustain itself for several hours.|$|E
5|$|Air {{rises and}} rotates around a {{vertical}} axis, {{usually in the}} same direction as low-pressure systems in both northern and southern hemisphere. They are most often cyclonic, that is, associated with a localized low-pressure region within a <b>supercell.</b> Such storms can feature strong surface winds and severe hail. Mesocyclones often occur together with updrafts in supercells, where tornadoes may form. About 1700 mesocyclones form annually across the United States, but only half produce tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|Early in the afternoon, another <b>supercell</b> {{developed}} {{around the}} town of Maryborough, around 300km north of Brisbane. It developed rapidly also, and at 2:30pm a number of reports sent to the Bureau of Meteorology reported a tornado had touched down in Oakhurst, a rural area 10km west of Maryborough. However, due to the low population density in the area the reported damage was sparse, with one house destroyed, several others unroofed and hundreds of trees were snapped.|$|E
5|$|Most tornadoes from <b>supercells</b> {{follow a}} {{recognizable}} life cycle. That begins when increasing rainfall drags with it {{an area of}} quickly descending air known as the rear flank downdraft (RFD). This downdraft accelerates as it approaches the ground, and drags the <b>supercell's</b> rotating mesocyclone towards the ground with it.|$|R
5000|$|This is {{generally}} {{the area of}} heaviest and most widespread precipitation. For most <b>supercells,</b> the precipitation core is bounded on its leading edge by a shelf cloud that results from rain-cooled air within the precipitation core spreading outward and interacting with warmer, moist air from outside of the cell. Between the precipitation-free base and the FFD, a [...] "vaulted" [...] or [...] "cathedral" [...] feature can be observed. In high precipitation <b>supercells</b> an area of heavy precipitation may occur beneath the main updraft area where the vault would alternately be observed with classic <b>supercells.</b>|$|R
