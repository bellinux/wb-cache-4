5|$|Some {{scholars}} {{question the}} poet's sexuality, theorizing that the numerous letters and poems that were dedicated to Susan Gilbert Dickinson indicate a lesbian romance, and speculating {{about how this}} may have influenced her poetry. Critics such as John Cody, Lillian Faderman, Vivian R. Pollak, Paula Bennett, Judith Farr, Ellen Louise Hart, and Martha Nell Smith have argued that <b>Susan</b> <b>was</b> the central erotic relationship in Dickinson's life.|$|E
5|$|<b>Susan</b> <b>was</b> {{diagnosed}} with Multiple sclerosis in 2007. Two years prior, MS Australia pitched a storyline to the Neighbours team {{asking for a}} character to be {{diagnosed with}} MS and for them to then show the impact MS can have on a community. The society contacted a producer and discussed a possible storyline for a young character in her twenties who had a promising career and family ahead of her. In 2006, the society {{received a phone call}} from one of the writers who revealed that they had chosen to write an MS story into the show and they had selected Susan Kennedy to be the character that was going to be diagnosed. The society was initially disappointed, as <b>Susan</b> <b>was</b> older than the typical person diagnosed with the condition. However, they were pleased that a permanent character and not an extra was chosen. MS Australia attended a meeting with the Neighbours writers to help develop a realistic and true portrayal of the diagnosis, symptoms and treatments. On-screen <b>Susan</b> <b>was</b> seen displaying unusual symptoms, including black outs and loss of sight and sensation in her hands. She was then seen undergoing an MRI scan, before she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.|$|E

5|$|In {{the five}} years that take place between seasons four and five, Susan and Mike are {{involved}} in a car crash that kills a mother and her daughter. Although <b>Susan</b> <b>was</b> driving, Mike takes the blame, as Susan did not have her license with her at the time. Susan feels incredibly guilty for taking the lives of Lila (Marie Caldare) and Paige Dash (Madeleine Michelle Dunn), but Mike insists it was not their fault. The argument over the topic becomes so great that it results in divorce. Giving up on love, Susan engages in a casual relationship with her house painter, Jackson Braddock (Gale Harold).|$|E
5|$|When {{only the}} four {{alliance}} members remained, the vote initially {{ended in a}} draw; close allies Richard and Rudy voted for Susan, and Susan and Kelly voted for Richard. On the revote, Kelly decided to switch her vote and <b>Susan</b> <b>was</b> eliminated. After winning the final immunity challenge, Kelly decided to eliminate Rudy because she believed she had a better chance against Richard. At the final Tribal Council, Susan lambasted Kelly for switching her vote and proclaimed her support for Richard. Richard's strategic prowess and leadership were valued over Kelly's impressive challenge performances, and the jury awarded him the title of Sole Survivor in a vote of 4-3.|$|E
5|$|The Carnival of the Animals, Finale was {{directed}} by Goldberg; his wife <b>Susan</b> <b>was</b> its art director. The idea originated from animator Joe Grant, {{one of the two}} story directors on Fantasia who loved the ostriches in Dance of the Hours. When development for Fantasia 2000 began, Grant suggested the idea of having one of the ostriches play with a yo-yo to the last movement of The Carnival of the Animals. The ostriches were later changed to flamingos as Disney wished to avoid reintroducing characters from the original film and thought flamingos would look more colorful on the screen. Goldberg was partly inspired by co-director Mike Gabriel, who would play with a yo-yo as he took a break from working on Pocahontas (1995). The segment was produced with CGI and 6,000 watercolor paintings on heavy bond paper.|$|E

5|$|The group {{decides to}} use Susan, who is least willing to {{participate}} in the plot, to distract Mr. Griffin by requesting a conference with him after school. Since Susan is one of his better-performing students with a serious approach to her studies, Mr. Griffin willingly does so, allowing her to walk him to his car afterwards. Jeff, David and Mark forcefully place a bag over Mr. Griffin's head and tie him up, replacing the bag with a blindfold as they take him to a remote spot in the mountains. Betsy, thanks to a speeding ticket, arrives in the parking lot after the boys have left with Mr. Griffin. <b>Susan</b> <b>was</b> supposed to ride with Betsy, but does not want any further part in the scheme and Betsy leaves without her.

Meanwhile, Jackson returns to Fairview and proposes to Susan, revealing that his visa has expired and he needs to marry an American citizen. When Susan learns that Mike, who is engaged to Katherine, will no longer have to pay alimony once she is married, she explains the false pretenses of her engagement. Dave, who now understands that <b>Susan</b> <b>was</b> driving the car that killed his family, overhears this and reports Jackson to immigration officials. With Jackson out of the picture, Dave invites Susan and M.J. on a fishing trip, planning to kill M.J. just like Susan killed his own child.

25|$|That <b>Susan</b> <b>was</b> Kane's {{wife and}} Marion was Hearst's {{mistress}} {{is a difference}} more important than might be guessed in today's changed climate of opinion. The wife was a puppet and a prisoner; the mistress was never less than a princess. Hearst built more than one castle, and Marion was the hostess in all of them: they were pleasure domes indeed, and the Beautiful People of the day fought for invitations. Xanadu was a lonely fortress, and <b>Susan</b> <b>was</b> quite right to escape from it. The mistress was never one of Hearst's possessions: he was always her suitor, {{and she was the}} precious treasure of his heart for more than 30 years, until his last breath of life. Theirs is truly a love story. Love is not the subject of Citizen Kane.|$|E

When once asked if <b>Susan</b> <b>was</b> Channing's most fully realized character, the actress replied: Well, you like to think that they’re all fully realized because what you’re doing is different from what anyone else is seeing. You do a character but {{how much of it is}} on film, or how much of it is seen by an audience, is really up to the director, the piece, or the audience. And so, I just do these people. And flesh them out. I think anything else is not my job.|$|E
