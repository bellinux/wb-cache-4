50|$|Hirsch Perlman’s oeuvre spans sculpture, scripted film, stop-motion {{animation}} and photography. His experimental, accumulative, {{and often}} time-based practice draws the viewer into his rigorous tests of visual and literal, {{and the limits}} of control. He implements simple materials and clichés, reworked to produce poignant and unexpected results. His large <b>silk-screen</b> <b>prints</b> of cat drawings entitled Schrödinger Cats are named for the Austrian physicist’s experiment to illustrate the paradox of quantum mechanics and the contingencies of physical context. The emblematic cat trapped in a box, and simultaneously dead and alive has been co-opted by popular and science-fiction writers from Robert Anton Wilson to Douglas Adams. In the early 1990s, Perlman produced a series of works around the theme of evidence, several of which were included in the 1992 exhibition Exhibit A, held at the Serpentine Gallery, in London.|$|R
