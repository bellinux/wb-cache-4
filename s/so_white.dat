5|$|In 1789, Sally and James Hemings {{returned}} to the United States with Jefferson. He was 46 years old and seven years a widower. As shown by Jefferson's father-in-law, John Wayles, wealthy Virginia widowers frequently raped enslaved women. Historian Joshua D. Rothman noted {{it was not unusual}} for the time for Jefferson to choose to do <b>so.</b> <b>White</b> society simply expected these men to be discreet.|$|E
5|$|Although the VC held {{a greater}} {{portion of the}} Ngok Tavak garrison, {{particularly}} on the eastern side, their attack was stalled. After the 40th Battalion had overrun the command post, they tried to advance on the landing zone where allied soldiers {{had set up a}} strong position from fortified underground bunkers, which the VC had failed to detect in their previous reconnaissance patrols. At 04:20, an AC-47 gunship from the 4th Air Commando Squadron was reported to be flying over the garrison, <b>so</b> <b>White</b> directed the aircraft to fire down on VC-held positions around the perimeter. After he had shouted warnings to the Marines and the Nungs, White approved the aircraft to fire on the position area of the 105mm howitzers. The arrival of the AC-47 enabled the allied forces to hold their last remaining ground, and repulse the final attack. By 05:30, fighting in and around Ngok Tavak was limited to the hurling of grenades, and random fire on any movement that was believed to be that of the VC. In one of their final attempts to overcome the last allied position, the VC set off tear gas of such low density that it had little effect on most of the allied soldiers.|$|E
5|$|This {{explains}} {{the most natural}} plans for both sides. White will try a minority attack on the queenside, {{in order to increase}} its space advantage and to create some weaknesses in the black pawns (e.g. an isolated pawn or a backward pawn). <b>So</b> <b>White</b> will try to use the advances b2–b4 or c4–c5 in good conditions, supported by the queen and the rooks on the c-file and the d-file. On the other hand, Black will try to keep the position closed, most importantly by keeping the c4-pawn where it is {{in order to keep the}} Bf1 at bay. This can be achieved by moves like b7–b6 and d7–d6, and sometimes the manoeuvre Ne5–d7–f8–e6. The first move by Black has to be 10...d6! because otherwise White plays 11.c5! and gets a clear advantage immediately. For example 10...b6? loses a pawn to 11.Qd5 Nc6 12.Bxc7, and 10...0-0?! is bad because of 11.c5! Qxc5? 12.Rc1 Qe7 13.Rxc7 and White is winning already.|$|E

Qb6, the idea is to increase the pressure on d4 and eventually undermine the White centre. The queen also attacks the b2-square, <b>so</b> <b>White's</b> dark-square bishop cannot easily defend the d4-pawn without losing the b2-pawn. White's most common replies are 6.a3 and 6.Be2.|$|R

25|$|White wine is also {{a dessert}} wine. All choices are allowed even if the sweet and {{fortified}} wines {{are more suitable for}} this. Perfumed wines (Gewurztraminer, Muscat), sparkling, and sweet wines accord well with fruit desserts (salad, tart). The fortified and sparkling wines support rich desserts made with cream or butter. Crèmes brûlées or caramel which combine sugar and cream can be eaten with a sweet and lively wine such as Jurançon or a late harvest wine. Chocolate requires a very powerful wine <b>so</b> <b>white</b> wine selection is quite limited: a natural amber sweet wine is the best compromise.|$|E
25|$|UE also {{stood out}} in that period for its {{advocacy}} of equality for African American workers. In July 1950 UE leaders appointed Ernest Thompson, a black international representative and former rank-and-file factory worker, {{as secretary of the}} UE Fair Practices Committee. In essence the union's affirmative action officer, Thompson met with the leadership of UE locals around the country to develop and implement action plans to force employers to hire more black workers, and to give African Americans opportunities to advance into skilled trades jobs. In the midst of the Cold War assaults on UE, the union's newspaper reported such success stories as the promotion of a black worker at Johnson Machine to lathe operator. The company had insisted that this worker was unqualified and refused to train him, <b>so</b> <b>white</b> union members had taught him the job during their lunch breaks.|$|E
25|$|Instead, White {{responds}} correctly to Black 3 with 4 in {{the first}} diagram below. Now, contrary to the situation after White 2, Black can legally play at b, because the resulting position, shown in the second diagram, has not occurred previously. It differs from the position after Black 1 {{because of the presence}} of Black 3 and White 4 on the board. Now White is prohibited from recapturing at a by the ko rule. White has no moves elsewhere on the board requiring an immediate reply from Black (ko threats), <b>so</b> <b>White</b> plays the less urgent move 6, capturing the black stone at 3, which could not have evaded capture even if White had waited. In the next diagram, Black connects at a before White has a chance to recapture. Both players pass and the game ends in this position.|$|E

25|$|The {{milling of cereals}} {{results in}} {{considerable}} loss (up to 60%) of vitamin B2, <b>so</b> <b>white</b> flour is enriched in some countries such as US by addition of the vitamin. The enrichment of bread and ready-to-eat breakfast cereals contributes significantly to the dietary supply of vitamin B2. Polished rice is not usually enriched, because the vitamin’s yellow color would make the rice visually unacceptable to the major rice-consumption populations. However, most of the flavin content of whole brown rice is retained if the rice is steamed (parboiled) prior to milling. This process drives the flavins in the germ and aleurone layers into the endosperm. Free riboflavin is naturally present in foods along with protein-bound FMN and FAD. Bovine milk contains mainly free riboflavin, with a minor contribution from FMN and FAD. In whole milk, 14% of the flavins are bound noncovalently to specific proteins. in Bovine Milk: its concentration, distribution, and binding linkage, J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol., 37, 15, 1991 Egg white and egg yolk contain specialized riboflavin-binding proteins, which are required for storage of free riboflavin in the egg {{for use by the}} developing embryo.|$|E

500|$|White {{was only}} able to offer his writers one cent per word, which was {{substantially}} lower than the leading magazines in the field—Analog Science Fiction and Fact paid five cents, and Galaxy and Fantasy & Science Fiction paid three. [...] Most stories would only be submitted to White once the higher-paying markets had rejected them, but among the rejects White was sometimes able to find experimental material that he liked. [...] For example, Piers Anthony {{had been unable to}} sell an early fantasy novel, Hasan; White saw a review of the manuscript and promptly acquired it for Fantastic, where it was serialized starting in the December 1969 issue. [...] White also took care to establish relationships with newer writers. [...] White bought Gordon Eklund's first story, [...] "Dear Aunt Annie", it appeared in the April 1970 issue and was nominated for a Nebula award. [...] Eklund was unwilling to become a full-time writer, despite this success, because of the financial risks, <b>so</b> <b>White</b> agreed to buy anything Eklund wrote, on condition that Eklund himself believed it was a good story. [...] The result was that much of Eklund's fiction appeared in Amazing and Fantastic over the next few years. [...] In addition to experimental work, White was able to obtain material by some of the leading sf writers of the day, including Brian Aldiss and John Brunner. [...] White also acquired some early work by writers who became better known in other fields: Roger Ebert sold two stories in the early 1970s to Fantastic; the first, [...] "After the Last Mass", appeared in the February 1972 issue; and in 1975 White bought Ian McEwan's second story, [...] "Solid Geometry". [...] It was included in First Love, Last Rites, McEwan's first short story collection, which won the Somerset Maugham Award in 1976.|$|E

25|$|Underpromotion to knight or rook in {{practical}} play is rare, and to bishop is even rarer, but in composed chess {{problems such as}} this last example, it occurs more often. Perhaps the most famous example is the Saavedra position. Some cases can be quite spectacular: a study by Jan Rusinek, for example, sees White promoting to knight, bishop and rook in order to induce stalemate. An Allumwandlung is a problem where promotions to all four possible pieces occur. An extreme example is the Babson task, where underpromotions by Black are countered by matching underpromotions by <b>White</b> (<b>so</b> if Black promotes to a rook, <b>so</b> does <b>White,</b> and <b>so</b> on), <b>White's</b> underpromotions being {{the only way to}} mate Black in the stipulated number of moves.|$|R
