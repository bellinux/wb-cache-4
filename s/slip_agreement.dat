The effective low-energy theory of rope superconductivity explains the experimental results on the temperature-dependent resistance below the transition temperature in terms of quantum phase <b>slips.</b> Quantitative <b>agreement</b> with only one fit parameter can be obtained.

30|$|We have {{successfully}} relocated 168 shallow earthquakes in the mainland of West Java {{in the period}} from 2009 to 2015 by re-examining seismograms. There are 117 events that have been relocated successfully by applying the double-difference method. The seismicity pattern shows clearly several clusters of events located near active faults in West Java, i.e., Lembang, Cimandiri, and Baribis faults. The focal mechanism around the Lembang fault indicates a left-lateral strike <b>slip</b> in <b>agreement</b> with previous studies. Around the Cimandiri fault the focal mechanism also shows a left-lateral strike slip, but it changes to a thrust fault towards the south. While around the Baribis fault zone, a thrust fault is shown, but it becomes oblique to the east. The cluster of earthquakes in Garut forms a lineament pattern trending southwest–northeast, {{and most of the}} focal mechanisms in this cluster show a right-lateral strike slip if the lineament is related to local fault.|$|R

The approach consisted in modelling the gauge area located at {{the centre of the}} crystals with boundary conditions extracted from displacement fields measured experimentally by digital image correlation. Thanks to three different geometries of samples, three loading paths were considered: uniaxial tension, plane strain tension and equi-biaxial tension. Comparisons between simulations and experimental observations were performed in terms of displacement fields, strain fields and slip traces. Data obtained from the simulations also allowed analysis of the results in terms of crystal rotation, dislocation density evolution and accumulated <b>slip.</b> Reasonable <b>agreement</b> between experimental observations and simulations was generally obtained, except for the prediction of strain localisation which was only correct in the case of uniaxial and plane strain tension.

Earthquake locations were determined using Hypoellipse code that employs a single event determination method. We then relocated the events using hypocenter double-difference method. We also conducted focal mechanism analysis {{to estimate the}} type of fault slip. The results indicate improved hypocenter locations, where patterns of seismicity in West Java were delineated clearly. There are several clusters of earthquakes at depths[*]≤[*] 30  km, which are probably related to the Cimandiri, Lembang, and Baribis faults. In addition, there is another cluster in Garut trending southwest-northeast, which is possibly related to a local fault. Histograms of travel-time residuals depict good results, in which travel-time residuals are mostly close to zero. Source mechanism throughout the Lembang fault indicates a left-lateral strike <b>slip</b> in <b>agreement</b> with previous studies. The Cimandiri fault also shows a left-lateral slip, but in the south it shows a thrust fault mechanism.

40|$|There is {{a growing}} need for {{reliable}} methods of assessing the load-carrying capacity and remaining service life of deteriorated structures. One {{of the most common}} causes of deterioration is corrosion of steel reinforcement. In earlier work by Lundgren [1], a model describing the effects of corrosion and bond was developed and implemented in the finite element program Diana, and verified by comparisons to test results. In the work presented here, a parameter study to quantify the effect of corrosion penetration on the bond behaviour was carried out. A typical section of a reinforced concrete slab was modelled. The following parameters were varied: concrete strength and cover, main reinforcement diameter and spacing, amount of transversal reinforcement, and corrosion penetration. The bond behaviour was significantly affected when corrosion led to cover cracking. From the results, it was noted {{that it was possible to}} obtain the bond-slip response of corroded reinforcement by shifting the bond-slip curve of uncorroded reinforcement along the slip axis. The shift along the slip axis is determined by the degree of corrosion. Thus, a level of corrosion is assumed to correspond to a certain amount of <b>slip.</b> Good <b>agreement</b> was found for all the analysed cases...|$|R

40|$|It is now {{possible}} to create perfect crystal nanowires of many metals. The deformation of such objects requires {{a good understanding of}} the processes involved in plasticity at the nanoscale. Isotropic compression of such nanometre scale micropillars is a good model system to understand the plasticity. Here we investigate these phenomena using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of nanometre scale single crystal BCC iron pillars in compression. We find that pillars with large length to width ratio may buckle under high strain rates. The type of buckling behaviour depends sensitively on the boundary conditions used: periodic boundary conditions allow for rotation at top and bottom of the pillar, and result in an S shaped buckle, by contrast fixed boundaries enforce a C shape. Pillars with a length to width ratio closer to that used in experimental micropillar compression studies show deformation behaviour dominated by <b>slip,</b> in <b>agreement</b> with the experiments. For micropillars oriented along, slip occurs on planes and localized slip bands are formed. Pillars of this size experience higher stresses than bulk materials before yielding takes place. One might expect that this may be in part {{due to the lack of}} nucleation sites needed to induce slip. However, further simulations with possible dislocation sources: a shorter iron pillar containing a spherical grain boundary, and a similar pillar containing jagged edges did not show a decreased yield strength.

40|$|Geomechanical models {{based on}} linear {{elasticity}} {{have been used}} to predict the mode and distribution of subseismic fractures around larger faults. These models can be tested against field observations of surface breaks (fractures) formed in the aftermath of large earthquakes. This paper presents forward models based on elastic dislocation theory of the deformation due to the M s 7. 3 earthquake at El Asnam, Algeria in 1980. Using fault parameters from previous geodetic studies to define a set of larger faults, our models calculate the deformation field in the surrounding rock volume. We compare predicted strain and stress fields with the surface deformation measured in the area following the 1980 earthquake. Using a combination of the redistributed elastic dislocation stress due to slip on the major faults and a small component of overburden stress, the models successfully predict normal faults and tensile fractures in the hanging wall of the reverse fault system. Orientations of the predicted faults vary along strike of the fault system, being parallel to the main reverse fault in the south but oblique to it along the central segment, agreeing with observed surface breaks. The results of our forward modeling are not sensitive to the magnitude or direction of a regional tectonic stress. The predicted fractures are controlled by the near-field, short-term redistributed stresses due to coseismic <b>slip.</b> The <b>agreement</b> between modeled and measured deformation patterns adds confidence in the use of elastic dislocation theory to accurately predict small faults generated by coseismic slip on large faults...|$|R

The deviation from a strict self-similar behavior within each earthquake sequence of our collection {{is indicated by}} a systematic increase in the estimated average static stress drop and apparent stress with increasing seismic moment (moment magnitude). Our favored physical interpretation for the increased apparent stress with earthquake size is a progressive frictional weakening for increasing seismic <b>slip,</b> in <b>agreement</b> with recent results obtained in laboratory experiments performed on state-of-the-art apparatuses at slip rates {{of the order of}} 1 m/s or larger. At smaller magnitudes (MW 5. 5) show much less variability: about one order of magnitude. It appears that the apparent stress (and static stress drop) does not grow indefinitely at larger magnitudes: for example, {{in the case of the}} Chi–Chi sequence (the best sampled sequence between MW 5 and 6. 5), some roughly constant stress parameters characterize earthquakes larger than MW = 5. 5. A representative fault slip for MW 5. 5 is a few tens of centimeters (e. g., IDE and TAKEO, 1997), which corresponds to the slip amount at which effective lubrication is observed, according to recent laboratory friction experiments performed at seismic slip velocities (V ~ 1 m/s) and normal stresses representative of crustal depths (DI TORO et al., 2011, and references therein). If the observed deviation from self-similar scaling is explained in terms of an asymptotic increase in apparent stress (MALAGNINI et al., 2014, this volume), which is directly related to dynamic stress drop on the fault, one interpretation is that for a seismic slip of a few tens of centimeters (MW ~ 5. 5) or larger, a fully lubricated frictional state may be asymptotically approached...|$|R

Our results suggest that volumetric strain may significantly influence the values of SFEs of both pure Mg and its alloys, which will eventually modify the dislocation core structure, Peierls stress, and preferred <b>slip</b> system, in <b>agreement</b> with recent experimental results. The so-called "strain factor" that was previously proposed for the solute strengthening could be justified as a major contribution to the strain effect on SFEs. Based on multivariate regression analysis, we proposed universal exponential relationships between the dislocation core structure, the Peierls stress, and the stable or unstable SFEs. Electronic structure calculations suggest that the variations of these critical parameters controlling strength and ductility under strain {{can be attributed to}} the strain-induced electronic polarization and redistribution of valence charge density at hollow sites.

40|$|The main {{thrust of}} the {{research}} presented in this thesis is atomistic studies of dislocations in crystalline materials using computer modeling. Dislocations affect many properties of materials and control their deformation behavior. The aim {{of this research is}} to establish the connection between the core structure of dislocations determined by computer modeling and the experimentally observed deformation modes. This thesis comprises two separate projects, employing similar methodology: studies of dislocations in L 10 TiAl and in pure Ti. The former investigation is presented in Section A. Computer simulations were performed by molecular statics method using the Finnis-Sinclair type potential for Ti-Al alloys, which was constructed {{in the course of this}} work. The results of this study allowed us to propose an explanation for the deformation behavior of TiAl-based alloys, which has later received both theoretical and experimental support. The second part of the thesis (Section B) is concerned with studies of dislocations in the hcp Ti. The experimentally observed deformation mode in this material is slip in the prism plane, while previous computer modeling studies based on central-force potentials predicted the dominance of the slip in the basal plane. It was suggested that this phenomenon is an indication of strong directional bonding in Ti due to the presence of an unfilled d-band in this element. The study of dislocations and γ-surfaces were performed using both a central-force Finnis-Sinclair type potential and a bond-order potential, which includes the possible effects of directional bonding. The bond-order potential for Ti was constructed in the course of this work. This was the first application of this recently developed method to studies of extended defects in metals. The results of our study employing the bond-order potential unambiguously show that the prism slip is preferred in Ti. Analogous calculations using the central-force Finnis-Sinclair type potential predict the preference for the basal <b>slip,</b> in <b>agreement</b> with other central-force studies but in disagreement with experiment. Thus we have demonstrated that the prism slip observed in Ti is a consequence of the directional bonding of d-electrons in this material. ...|$|R

Source {{properties}} of low-to-moderate magnitude events in Eastern Turkey were studied in detail using high quality waveform data from temporary broadband network {{recorded by the}} Eastern Turkey Seismic Experiment (ETSE).

40|$|A traction-displacement {{relationship}} {{that may be}} embedded into a cohesive zone model for microscale problems of intergranular fracture is extracted from atomistic molecular-dynamics simulations. A molecular-dynamics model for crack propagation under steady-state conditions is developed to analyze intergranular fracture along a flat 99 [1 1 0] symmetric tilt grain boundary in aluminum. Under hydrostatic tensile load, the simulation reveals asymmetric crack propagation in the two opposite directions along the grain boundary. In one direction, the crack propagates in a brittle manner by cleavage with very little or no dislocation emission, {{and in the other}} direction, the propagation is ductile through the mechanism of deformation twinning. This behavior is consistent with the Rice criterion for cleavage vs. dislocation blunting transition at the crack tip. The preference for twinning to dislocation <b>slip</b> is in <b>agreement</b> with the predictions of the Tadmor and Hai criterion. A comparison with finite element calculations shows that while the stress field around the brittle crack tip follows the expected elastic solution for the given boundary conditions of the model, the stress field around the twinning crack tip has a strong plastic contribution. Through the definition of a Cohesive-Zone-Volume-Element an atomistic analog to a continuum cohesive zone model element - the results from the molecular-dynamics simulation are recast to obtain an average continuum traction-displacement relationship to represent cohesive zone interaction along a characteristic length of the grain boundary interface for the cases of ductile and brittle decohesion.

40|$|The physics {{governing}} the seismic cycle at seismically active subduction zones remains poorly understood due to restricted direct observations {{in time and}} space. To investigate subduction zone dynamics and associated interplate seismicity, we validate a continuum, visco-elasto-plastic numerical model with a new laboratory approach (Paper 1). The analogous laboratory setup includes a visco-elastic gelatin wedge underthrusted by a rigid plate with defined velocity-weakening and -strengthening regions. Our geodynamic simulation approach includes velocity-weakening friction to spontaneously generate a series of fast frictional instabilities that correspond to analog earthquakes. A match between numerical and laboratory source parameters is obtained when velocity-strengthening is applied in the aseismic regions to stabilize the rupture. Spontaneous evolution of absolute stresses leads to nucleation by coalescence of neighboring patches, mainly occurring at evolving asperities near the seismogenic zone limits. Consequently, a crack-, or occasionally even pulse-like, rupture propagates toward {{the opposite side of}} the seismogenic zone by increasing stresses ahead of its rupture front, until it arrests on a barrier. The resulting surface displacements qualitatively agree with geodetic observations and show landward and, from near the downdip limit, upward interseismic motions. These are rebound and reversed coseismically. This slip increases adjacent stresses, which are relaxed postseismically by afterslip and thereby produce persistent seaward motions. The wide range of observed physical phenomena, including back-propagation and repeated <b>slip,</b> and the <b>agreement</b> with laboratory results demonstrate that visco-elasto-plastic geodynamic models with rate-dependent friction form a new tool that can greatly contribute to our understanding of the seismic cycle at subduction zones...|$|R
40|$|We have {{simulated}} several {{scenarios of}} dynamic rupture propagation for the 1994 Northridge, California, earthquake, using a three-dimensional finite-difference method. The simulations use a rate- and slip-weakening friction law, starting {{from a range}} of initial conditions of stress and frictional parameters. A critical balance between initial conditions and friction parameters must be met in order to obtain a moment as well as a final <b>slip</b> distribution in <b>agreement</b> with kinematic <b>slip</b> inversion results. We find that the rupture process is strongly controlled by the average stress and connectivity of high-stress patches on the fault. In particular, a strong connectivity of the high-stress patches is required in order to promote the rupture propagation from the initial nucleation to the remaining part of the fault. Moreover, we find that a small amount of rate-weakening is needed in order to obtain a level of inhomogeneity in the final slip, similar to that obtained in the kinematic inversion results. However, when the amount of rate-weakening is increased, the overall moment drops dramatically unless the average prestress is raised to unrealistic levels. A velocity-weakening parameter on the order of 10 cm per second is found to be adequate for an average prestress of about a hundred bars. The presence of the free surface and of the uppermost low-impedance layers in the model are found to have negligible influence on the rupture dynamics itself, because the top of the fault is at a depth of several kilometers. The 0. 1 – 0. 5 Hz radiated waves from the dynamic simulation provides a good fit to strong motion data at sites NWH and SSA. Underprediction of the recorded peak amplitude at JFP is likely due to omission of near-surface low velocity and 3 -D basin effects in the simulations...|$|R

The governing equations are closed using relations from the Kinetic Theory of Granular Flow (KTGF) combined with a frictional stress model due to Johnson and Jackson and Schaeffer and inter-phase drag due to Wen and Yu. In addition, calculations are presented for a model with a constant particle phase viscosity (CPV). Free slip and partial slip boundary conditions for the solid phase velocity at the vessel wall and the impeller have been utilized. The results show that the bed height could be well predicted by the partial slip model, whereas the free slip model could not capture the experimentally found bed height satisfactorily. For the KTGF model, the swirling motion of the rotating torus that is formed by the moving powder bed was over-predicted and the tangential wall velocity was under-predicted, probably {{due to the fact that}} the frictional stress model needs to be further developed, e. g. to tackle cohesive particles in dense flow. The CPV model gave predictions in good agreement with the experiments for a solids viscosity of 0. 1. Pa. s and a wall slip parameter of 0. 005. m/Pa. s.

40|$|The instabilities {{that occur}} in the {{pressure-driven}} extrusion of molten polymers are fascinating from the scientific perspective but troublesome and sometimes catastrophic from the industrial one. Flow anomalies like sharkskin, Stick-Slip and Gross Melt fracture can occur in common extrusion operations such as the manufacture of polymeric rods, tubes, sheets, films, tanks or wire coating. Over the years, processors have learned to work around these processing defects by a variety of means: slowing the manufacturing rate, increasing the melt temperature or by- addition of processing additives. All these solutions can be proven extremely costly, thus a significant interest and effort is put in designing and manufacturing polymers with better processing-properties and lower potential to flow-instabilities. Sharkskin, here defined as periodic surface distortions of low amplitude and high frequency, is most commonly observed in polyethylene’s of sufficiently narrow molecular weight. One reason why sharkskin is of great importance is that as the extrusion flow rate increases, it is in many cases the first instability to occur, it is challenging to suppress and affects an important product quality parameter, namely the surface appearance. FT Rheology can be used to study different PE industrial samples with respect to their behavior under the LAOS flow. The resulting non-linearities showed a dependency on both the molecular weight and topology [1]. Filipe et al. [1] found out that for strain amplitudes above a critical value, the stress time signal exhibited an amplitude decay that indicates <b>slip</b> in qualitative <b>agreement</b> with Chen et al. [2] and Hatzikiriakos and Dealy [3]. The second harmonic was thus found to become significant (above noise level) {{at the onset of the}} stress amplitude decay and it is found to be a useful indicator of secondary flows or generally instabilities.

40|$|The rupture {{characteristics}} of the 1987 Superstition Hills (M_s = 6. 6), the 1989 Loma Prieta (M_s = 7. 1), and the 1991 Sierra Madre (M_L = 5. 8) earthquakes were determined using a constrained, damped, least-squares inversion of strong motion and teleseismic waveforms. Extension of the modeling procedure to employ teleseismic, empirical Green's functions allowed determination of faulting details of a fourth earthquake, the great 1906 San Francisco event. The 1987 Superstition Hills earthquake was the second and larger of two significant earthquakes that occurred on conjugate faults in the western Imperial Valley. The first event (M_s = 6. 2), located on the Elmore Ranch Fault, had a geometry and mechanism favorable for triggering the larger event on the Superstition Hills Fault some 12 hours later. The Superstition Hills event was modeled as three independent subevents, each nucleating from a common location near {{the intersection of the}} two faults. This required rerupturing of one fault region on the time scale of several seconds. Slip was quite heterogeneous along strike, but fairly systematic as a function of depth. Substantial differences between the source process as observed from strong motion data and from teleseismic data were observed. The 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake began with a small (magnitude 4. 5 to 5. 0) precursor, which preceded {{the main part of the}} rupture by about 2 sec. Rupture was bilateral, with the overall radiation greater from the northwest portion of the fault. Separate inversions of the teleseismic data (periods 3 - 30 sec) and strong motion data (periods 1 - 5 sec) resulted in similar models, indicating a close correspondence of long- and short-period radiation. Forward predictions of the local strong motions from the teleseismic rupture model matched the distribution, duration and overall frequency content of the recordings, suggesting that constraints on strong motions can be made with teleseismic broadband recordings. Short period and broadband teleseismic waveform data and three-component strong-motion records were analyzed to obtain the source rupture history of the 1991 Sierra Madre earthquake. The near-field, shear-wave displacement pulse from this event had a relatively short duration (about 1 sec) for the magnitude of the event, requiring a particularly high-average stress drop (175 bars). The ground-motion variations in the Los Angeles region were controlled predominantly by source directivity. Rupture was updip and southwestward, resulting in strong motions and heavier damage in regions to the southwest of the epicenter and near the updip fault projection. The rupture process of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake was analyzed, using all high-quality, teleseismic recordings archived in the 1908 Carnegie Report of the State Earthquake Investigation Commission. The recordings are relatively simple considering the great rupture length in 1906, requiring that substantial portions of the fault, while having large slips, radiated little 5 - 25 sec energy. Two regions of the fault, one near the epicenter south of San Francisco, and one between Point Reyes and Fort Ross were responsible for generating the greater part of the energy observed on the teleseismic recordings. By comparison of our model for 1906 with modern, well-studied, large strike-slip events, we found similarities in rupture style with the relatively simple 1990 Philippines earthquake (M_s = 7. 8), but contrasts with the complexity of the 1976 Guatemala earthquake (M_s = 7. 5). The rupture {{characteristics of}} these events when analyzed with previous finite-fault studies over the past decade indicate several common features. Variations in slip are more pronounced along strike than downdip. Vertical strike-slip faults show a systematic slip variation with depth, consistent with both shallow and deep zones with velocity-strengthening frictional resistance; nucleation is usually at the base of the seismogenic zone. Oblique and dip-slip events show much more depth variation in slip, indicative of thicker, more complex seismogenic zones associated with tectonic regimes involving crustal thickening or extension. The Superstition Hills, Loma Prieta and Sierra Madre strong-motion data sets all require short rise times, so only a small portion of the fault is slipping at a particular time, in agreement with the "self-healing" model described by Heaton [1990] and in conflict with long slip durations required by many crack-like models of dynamic rupture. With the exception of the Superstition Hills earthquake, seismic moments and slip distributions determined from the strong-motion data concur with moments and slips derived from geodetic and longer-period waveforms. This indicates that the higher-frequency data are sufficient for estimating the total slip, and therefore, the rupture durations inferred represent the entire coseismic <b>slip</b> duration. The <b>agreement</b> between longand short-period source models makes it possible to estimate ground motions for important historical events from source models determined using longer-period (5 - 15 sec), teleseismic body waves. </p...|$|R
