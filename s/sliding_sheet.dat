5000|$|In 1881, Ferdinand E. Canda, {{a proponent}} of wooden freight car design who had built freight cars in the 1870s in Chicago, joined the Ensign Car Works as general manager.

Canda then designed an improvement to the drop-bottom gondola which was used in coal service at the time; his design featured a pair of <b>sliding</b> <b>sheet</b> metal doors (as opposed to the more common hinged doors) at the car's center. [...] A car of this design, built at Ensign, was shown at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893.

5000|$|Mies' design {{principle}} of [...] "less is more" [...] and emphasis on functional amenities created {{a fine example}} of early functionalism architecture, a groundbreaking new vision in building design at the time. Mies used a revolutionary iron framework, which enabled him to dispense with supporting walls and arrange the interior in order to achieve a feeling of space and light. One wall is a <b>sliding</b> <b>sheet</b> of plate glass that descends to the basement the way an automobile window does. Mies specified all the furnishings, in collaboration with interior designer Lilly Reich (two armchairs designed for the building, the Tugendhat chair and the Brno chair, are still in production). There were no paintings or decorative items in the villa, but the interior was by no means austere due to the use of naturally patterned materials such as the captivating onyx wall and rare tropical woods. The onyx wall is partially translucent and changes appearance when the evening sun is low. The architect managed to make the magnificent view from the villa {{an integral part of the}} interior.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWhereas in {{previous}} analogue experiments on gravitational spreading and gliding, detachment occurred on a ductile layer, {{we have used}} a relatively new technique of injecting compressed air into sand packs so as to simulate the effects of fluid overpressures in sedimentary strata and to trigger slope instabilities. In our experiments, the governing equations yield scales for dimensions, stresses and fluid pressure. However, the more transitory phenomena of production and decrease of overpressure cannot be suitably scaled. By using layers of differing permeability, we are able to produce sharp detachments in models made of sand alone. The experiments involve gravity spreading or gravity gliding. In gravity spreading, propagation of the detachment and of extensional deformation depends on the fluid pressure. For medium values of fluid overpressure, normal faults are closely spaced, numerous and bound rotated blocks. They propagate progressively {{toward the back of the}} model. For the highest pressures, the deformation propagates very fast and faults bound non-rotated blocks, which slide on an efficient basal detachment. Fault dips are also controlled by fluid pressure and by frictional resistance at the base. To model gravitational gliding required an apparatus with a more complex system of air injection. We did a series of experiments using injection windows of various lengths and compared the results with predictions from a quasi- 3 D analytical model of sliding. In contrast with predictions for an infinite slope, sliding depends on (1) the fluid overpressure on the detachment, (2) the fluid overpressure in the body of the <b>sliding</b> <b>sheet,</b> and (3) the shape of the detachment surface. In particular, we show that frictional resistance at the lower edge is a primary control on the dynamics of gliding...|$|E
40|$|Rationale, {{aims and}} {{objectives}} The overall {{aim of this}} study was to describe preventive interventions among persons with pressure ulcer (PU) in three nationwide PU prevalence surveys in Sweden. Methods A cross-sectional research design was used; more than 70 [*] 000 persons from different hospitals and nursing homes participated in the three prevalence surveys conducted in March 2011, October 2011 and March 2012. The methodology used was that recommended by the European Pressure Ulcers Advisory Panel. Results The overall prevalence of PU categories I–IV in hospitals was 16. 6 %, 14. 4 % and 16. 1 %, respectively. Corresponding figures for nursing homes were 14. 5 %, 14. 2 % and 11. 8 %, respectively. Heel protection/floating heels and <b>sliding</b> <b>sheets</b> were more frequently planned for persons with PU category I. Conclusions Despite the three prevalence studies that have showed high prevalence of PU the use of preventing interventions is still not on an acceptable level. Heel protection/floating heels and <b>sliding</b> <b>sheets</b> were more frequently planned for persons with PUs, and individual-planned repositioning also increased. However, when persons already have a PU they should all have pressure-reducing preventive interventions to prevent the development of more PUs. Preventing PUs presents a challenge even when facilities have prevention programmes. A PU prevention programme requires an enthusiastic leader who will maintain the team's focus and direction for all staff involved in patient care...|$|R

40|$|The Pitts Head welded {{ignimbrite}} records a subaerial, large-volume eruption {{and associated}} pyroclastic current that flowed into the sea. The current 15 km from source was steadily sustained with high mass flux and high particle concentration towards its base, and it entered the sea without substantial mixing {{with water and}} thus without large-scale hydroexplosivity and without general cooling. It continued to aggrade ignimbrite for at least 3 - 4 km from the original shoreline, in water initially ≥ 50 m deep. Entirely subaquous, hot-state, progressive aggradation and welding of the ignimbrite occurred where the water could not be wholly displaced by the current, although eventually the deposit displaced the shore> 4 km seawards. Wet sea-floor sediments buried by the ignimbrite were heated and locally fluidized by steam, and several square kilometres of hot ignimbrite with variable thicknesses of sedimentary substrate up to 60 m detached and slid downslope, almost perpendicular to the original flow direction. Directions of sliding and the order of piling-up of <b>slide</b> <b>sheets</b> are shown by hot-state (rheomorphic) deformation fabrics and the geometric relations of detachment surfaces. Sliding and slumping processes developed compressional structures like slump folds, stacking of several individual <b>slide</b> <b>sheets,</b> and lateral ramps, resulting in laterally varying thicknesses of 0 - 127 m. Extensional disruption of the ignimbrite is marked by breaks in the sheet via which fluidized sediments were mobilized, locally to form rootless vents. Both the initial incursion of the pyroclastic current into {{the sea and the}} subsequent submarine sliding of the ignimbrite are likely to have caused tsunami.

Such technology can provide real-time support for physically present participants, for online remote participation, or for offline access to meetings or lectures. Capturing relevant information from meetings or lectures is necessary to provide this kind of support. Multimedia presentation of this captured information {{requires a lot of}} attention. Our previous research has looked at including in these multimedia presentations a regeneration of meeting events and interactions in virtual reality. We developed technology that translates captured meeting activities into a virtual-reality version that lets us add and manipulate information. 1 In that research, our starting point was the human presenter or meeting participant. Here, it’s a semiautonomous virtual presenter that performs in a virtual- reality environment (see figure 1). The presenter’s audience might consist of humans, humans represented by embodied virtual agents, and autonomous agents that are visiting the virtual lecture room or have roles in it. In this article, we focus on models and associated algorithms that steer the virtual presenter’s presentation animations.

40|$|Radiographers are skilled {{professionals}} who play {{an essential role}} in creating high quality and relevant diagnostic images. The duties they perform such as transferring patients onto and off the examination table can however increase their risk of developing back and neck pain. A review of the literature was conducted and a research study was performed to identify which assistive transfer devices radiography students have used during training in the clinical setting. The project also sought to determine whether students are being encouraged by supervising radiographers to use these devices during clinical training and if they would conform to practicing unsafe transfers if instructed to by senior staff. The literature confirmed that there is limited knowledge into the use of assistive devices in reducing musculoskeletal (MSK) injuries and greater research is required into this issue. The results of the project indicated that the majority of radiography students 89 / 96 (93. 7 %) were familiar with the Patslide, friction reducing <b>slide</b> <b>sheet</b> (85 / 96 (89 %)) and the x-ray cassette slider (83 / 96 (86. 5 %)). Many of the students were unlikely to participate in unsafe work practices (77 / 96 (80. 2 %)) and most were able to provide alternative methods of transferring patients. However, some of the respondents were influenced by senior staff into participating in dangerous patient transfers. This may lead to the establishment of unsafe work practices among students. Radiographers who act as role models for students and junior radiographers should therefore be vigilant in refraining from practicing unsafe transfer techniques as it could lead to students believing it is acceptable and emulating these practices in the work place. The study has demonstrated that safe work practices need to be addressed in the undergraduate curriculum and that students need to be aware that unsafe practices should not be emulated. Further research is required in order to explore how unsafe work practices can be minimized in the clinical setting as well as the reasons why some radiographers do not use the assistive devices available...|$|R
