40|$|Foreign body <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bladder</b> is a {{relatively}} rare case. We encountered two cases of foreign bodies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bladder</b> after gynecological surgery. Case 1 was a 72 -year-old woman. When she was 70 years old, an operation for her pelvic organ prolapse was performed. She visited our hospital because of discomfort in urination. We performed a transurethral lithotripsy of <b>the</b> <b>bladder</b> stone and detected a foreign body, {{and it was an}} anchor used for the Tissue Fixation System(TFS) operation (a pelvic organ prolapse operation). Case 2 was a 34 -year-old woman. She delivered a baby by Caesarean section when she was 30 years old. She visited our hospital because of recurring urinary tract infection. The ultrasound examination of <b>the</b> <b>bladder</b> showed high echoic area <b>in</b> <b>the</b> posterior <b>bladder</b> wall. <b>The</b> cystoscope examination showed a small black foreign body that was protruding from the posterior wall of <b>the</b> <b>bladder.</b> <b>The</b> foreign body <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bladder</b> was a surgical suture.

40|$|Type I {{collagen}} {{forms the}} main constituent of <b>the</b> extracellular matrix <b>in</b> visceral organs.

Further studies on the intermediate signaling pathways mediating NGF-induced type I collagen expression <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inflamed <b>bladder</b> during cystitis revealed that Akt, JNK, and ERK 1 / 2 activities were increased <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inflamed <b>bladder,</b> whereas p 38 MAPK remained unchanged. Suppression of endogenous NGF level with neutralizing NGF antibody significantly blocked the increased activity of Akt, JNK, and ERK 1 / 2 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inflamed <b>bladder</b> during cystitis.

40|$|Abstract. The {{clinical}} {{occurrence of}} non-intervention-related vascular spasm following coronary stenting is rare. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> present study, 2 cases are reported.

The second patient developed an intense <b>spasm</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right coronary artery (RCA) following LAD artery stenting. Clinical course and prognosis are dangerous. The main treatment for this condition is a combina-tion of repeated injections of nitroglycerin into the coronary artery and the administration of calcium antagonists. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> clinic, intervention-related vascular <b>spasms</b> are common <b>in</b> percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to the mechanical stimulation caused by balloon dilatation or stent expansion. Injections of a vasodilator into the coronary artery are able to mitigate the spasms and the consequent prognosis is good...|$|R

40|$|Objective Bladder {{cancer is}} a cause of {{considerable}} morbidity worldwide. Electromotive Drug Administration is a method that combines intravesical chemotherapy with local electric field application. Electroporation has been suggested among other mechanisms as having a possible role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> therapy, so {{the goal of the}} present study was to investigate the electric fields present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bladder</b> wall during <b>the</b> treatment to determine which mechanisms might be involved. Material and Methods Electromotive Drug Administration involves applying intravesical mitomycin C with direct current of 20 mA delivered through a catheter electrode for 30 min. For numerical electric field computation we built a 3 -D nonhomogeneous patient specific model based on CT images and used finite element method simulations to determine <b>the</b> electric fields <b>in</b> <b>the</b> whole body. Results Results indicate that highest electric field <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bladder</b> wall was 37. 7 V/m. The mean electric field magnitude <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bladder</b> wall was 3. 03 V/m. The mean magnitude of <b>the</b> current density <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bladder</b> wall was 0. 61 A/m 2. Conclusions The present study shows that electroporation is not the mechanism of action in EMDA. A more likely explanation of the mechanism of action is iontophoretic forces increasing the mitomycin C concentration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bladder</b> wall...|$|R
