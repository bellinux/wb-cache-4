5|$|Although the Georgian Chronicles {{maintain}} that David died in 1001, several Armenian and Muslim accounts <b>suggest</b> <b>he</b> may {{have died in}} 1000. Aristakes gives the date of David’s death as March 28, 1000, which is closely corroborated by another Armenian chronicler Asoghik who says David died on the Easter {{day of the year}} 449 of the Armenian calendar, i.e., March 31, 1000. Yet another Armenian, Samuel Anetsi, also puts the date as 1000.|$|E
5|$|As a batsman, Macaulay was {{reasonably}} good and possibly {{better than his}} statistics would <b>suggest.</b> <b>He</b> was capable of batting well in a crisis but may have been prevented from honing his batting skills by the Yorkshire leadership who wished him to focus on bowling. He generally batted low down in the order after the all-rounders in the team. Macaulay's fielding was also very effective. He was excellent at close range to the batsmen, particularly from his own bowling.|$|E
5|$|Many of the Green Mountain Boys {{objected to}} Arnold's wish to command, insisting {{that they would}} go home rather than serve under anyone other than Ethan Allen. Arnold and Allen worked out an agreement, but no {{documented}} evidence exists concerning the deal. According to Arnold, he was given joint command of the operation. Some historians have supported Arnold's contention, while others <b>suggest</b> <b>he</b> was merely given the right to march next to Allen.|$|E

5|$|On 4 February Bär led I. Gruppe {{into action}} against B-17 Flying Fortress bombers from the 97th and 301st Bomb Group and their Lockheed P-38 Lightning escorts from the 1st Fighter Group. Bär claimed one B-17. On 15 February Bär claimed two USAAF Spitfires. The American pilots were {{possibly}} Lieutenant Joe Reed and H. E Huntingdon from the 31st Fighter Group. After an uncredited claim on 24 February over a P-40 Bär accounted for five on two days later. German fighter units claimed 13 against an actual 14 (possible 15) and several more damaged. Seven of the British pilots were unhurt. The following {{day he was}} credited with another P-40 in combat with 11 pilots from 4 Squadron SAAF.

5|$|Geoffrey died in September 1151, and Henry {{postponed}} {{his plans}} to return to England, as he first needed to ensure that his succession, particularly in Anjou, was secure. At around this time Henry was also probably secretly planning his marriage to Eleanor of Aquitaine, then still the wife of Louis. Eleanor was the Duchess of Aquitaine, a land in the south of France, and was considered beautiful, lively and controversial, but had not borne Louis any sons. Louis had the marriage annulled and Henry married Eleanor eight weeks later on 18 May. The marriage instantly reignited Henry's tensions with Louis: the marriage was considered an insult, it ran counter to feudal practice and it threatened the inheritance of Louis and Eleanor's two daughters, Marie and Alix, who might otherwise have had claims to Aquitaine on Eleanor's death. With his new lands, Henry now possessed a much larger proportion of France than Louis. Louis organised a coalition against Henry, including Stephen, Eustace, Henry the Count of Champagne, and Robert the Count of Perche. Louis's alliance was joined by Henry's younger brother, Geoffrey, who rose in revolt, claiming that Henry had dispossessed him of his inheritance. Geoffrey of Anjou's plans for the inheritance of his lands had been ambiguous, making the veracity of his son Geoffrey's claims hard to assess. Contemporaneous accounts <b>suggest</b> <b>he</b> left the main castles in Poitou to Geoffrey, implying that he may have intended Henry to retain Normandy and Anjou and not Poitou.|$|E
5|$|In late 1899, MacLaren {{joined a}} private cricket tour of America and Canada {{organised}} by the cricket-playing Indian prince Ranjitsinhji. The following March, {{he was appointed}} as an assistant secretary at Lancashire. The position was a sinecure; his main role was to coach the first eleven which effectively meant that he was paid to play cricket, despite his amateur status. Surviving records do not indicate his salary, but some sources <b>suggest</b> <b>he</b> was paid comfortably more than Lancashire's leading professionals. In addition, MacLaren worked as a journalist for the Daily Express, reporting on matches in which he played, a common practice at the time for amateurs. Resuming sole control over the Lancashire side, and freed from his teaching responsibilities, MacLaren played {{from the beginning of}} the 1900 season, planning meticulously in a bid to lead Lancashire to the County Championship. His batting form suffered initially, but the team dominated the start of the season. Commentators gave much of the credit to MacLaren's captaincy. However, he was severely criticised for conservative tactics in one game, when he was reluctant to attempt to force a win. In the latter stages of the season, MacLaren scored prolifically, making a succession of high scores at rapid pace. He ended the 1900 season with 1,554 runs at 36.13. During that season, the leading Lancashire bowler Arthur Mold had been no-balled for throwing, but MacLaren defended him in the press. At a meeting of county captains in December, MacLaren was the only representative to defend the legality of Mold's bowling action, and in 1901, Mold was again no-balled and his career was effectively over. MacLaren struggled with injury in 1901, and his batting form suffered. He frequently dropped low in the batting order, and it was late in the season before he began to score runs regularly. His captaincy was criticised after some tactical decisions which were either unconventional or unsuccessful, and he clashed with the Lancashire committee over the poor state of Old Trafford's pitch. In total, he scored 1,069 first-class runs at 31.44.|$|E
