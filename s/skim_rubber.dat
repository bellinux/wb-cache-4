The results showed that mooney viscosity of MSR is lower than <b>skim</b> <b>rubber,</b> and it is higher than SCR- 5 (Chinese Standard Rubber- 5). The complex viscosity (n*) and the stress relaxation have same results with mooney viscosity, that MSR’s is higher than SCR- 5 and lower than <b>skim</b> <b>rubber.</b> The elastic torque (S’) is increased with the frequency rising, and the S ’ of MSR {{is in the middle}} of the all samples...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} potential for grafting skim natural rubber with maleic anhydride to produce maleated rubber with the aim to increase value of skim natural rubber. In this study, grafting of skim natural rubber was compared to those of natural rubber block. Moreover, the effect of protein in <b>skim</b> <b>rubber</b> was also investigated by comparing with grafting of deprotinized <b>skim</b> <b>rubber.</b> Here, the grafting reactions were carried out by reactive melt-mixing method. The effect of maleic anhydride concentration and type of raw materials were investigated. Quantities of the grafted anhydride (MA) {{and the amount of}} double bonds were determined by using FTIR analysis. We found that nitrogen content of raw material could potentially affected the grafting level, especially at low MA content, and that the grafting reaction occurred in parallel with crosslinking reaction(gel). 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To recover {{residual}} <b>rubber</b> from <b>skim</b> natural <b>rubber</b> (SNR) latex, {{the effective}} and environmentally friendly methodology developed based on using hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) as a thermo-responsive flocculant. The SNR particles could be completely separated to form high concentrated latex as cream phase within only 5 hours. Almost 100 % of SNR was recovered when using HPMC 0. 7 %w/w. Quality of SNR obtained from this technique was higher {{and color of}} it was lighter than SNR obtained from the conventional method. HPMC could be easily precipitated from the serum phase by heating the serum phase at about 70 °C. The cloud point and the precipitation point of HPMC were affected by the additions of α-D-glucose, sn-phosphatidyl chloride and inorganic salts. It was found that reduction of the cloud point and the precipitation point of HPMC also depended on both concentration and type of cations and anions of inorganic salts...|$|R

Thusthe moisture sorption characteristics in terms of equilibrium moisture contents (EMC), enthalpy and entropy of heat sorptionof natural rubber (NR) for producing STR 20 and <b>skim</b> block <b>rubber</b> were investigated. Simulation modeling of water sorptionisotherms was performed using the 10 non-linear regression EMC models and the multilayer artificial neural network (ANN) approach. The {{results showed that the}} predicted EMC results using the modified Oswin model was the best fitting model forboth NR samples. However, the predicted values of ANN model were more accurate than those predicted results using nonlinear regression method. Finally, enthalpy and entropy of heat sorption for both NR samples were evaluated by applying theClausius-Clapeyron equation showing as the negative exponential function of moisture content...|$|R

The experiment {{was tested using}} wastewaters from removal of skim NR from concentrated NR industry. The ability to remove organic contaminants from aqueous solution, based on different molecular structures of organically modified clays, was evaluated using UV/VIS spectroscopy, chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solid (SS), total dissolved solid (TDS), total solid (TS) and total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN). In addition the mechanical properties of nanocomposites product obtained from coagulating method were determined by tensile testing. It reveals that mechanical properties of nanocomposites were improved {{when compared to the}} original <b>skim</b> <b>rubber.</b> The thermal stability and the composition of the coagulated skim rubber-organoclay nanocomposites were determined by thermogravimetric analysis...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Fresh field latex (FL) of Hevea brasiliensis was {{centrifuged}} {{to separate}} the major compartments: (i) the cream, (ii) the skim plus the C-serum, and (iii) the bottom fraction. Cream was dispersed in distilled water to prepare cream washed latex or CL sample. Skim was collected together with C-serum to prepare the skim latex or SKL sample. Then, films were made from FL, CL and SKL. The mesostructure (macromolecular structure and aggregates or gel) of the natural rubber films was studied by size exclusion chromatography coupled to a multiangular light scattering detector (SEC-MALS). The mesostructure was analyzed on fresh films and on films stored in the laboratory for three months (slow structuring). This study showed that FL and CL films had bimodal elution profiles of long and short polyisoprene chains as revealed by the two peaks on the chromatograms at low and high elution volumes, respectively. On the contrary, SKL films exhibited unimodal elution profiles at low elution volume and a highly abnormal molar masses elution profiles. After 3 months storage, the mesostructure of FL evolved dramatically especially the number-average molar masses (Mn), which increased by 60 %. The mesostructure of CL films evolved at a lesser extent and, the mesostructure of SKL films exhibited no significant change. These results indicated (i) the <b>skim</b> <b>rubber</b> particles are not prone to slow structuring during storage in presence of serum and (ii) some constituents either in the serum or/and in the bottom fraction could still be present with cream and {{be involved in the}} slow structuring of cream particles latex...|$|E
40|$|Rubber {{processing}} factories generate {{large amount}} of wastewater containing organic pollutants and various process chemicals. Rubber processing factory effluents exhibit high BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand), COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand), ammonia, and suspended solid concentrations. Except for a few, most rubber processing factories in Sri Lanka do not adequately treat the effluents before discharge either due to high cost of treatment or use of inefficient methods for treatment. Due to the low operating margins of this vital industry, that utilizes a waste product as raw material, an introduction A of expensive pollution control methods {{would lead to the}} collapse of the industry. In centrifuging plants the serum water contains 2. 5 % to 10. 0 % m/m. (I) dry rubber. Direct coagulation of this skim latex is not easy, because the colloid stability is enhanced by the high content of ammonia and protein containing substances, and by the small size of the dispersed rubber particles. One method of coagulation is by the addition of sulphuric acid where the skim is left to coagulate spontaneously. Then the coagulum is processed by conventional means, and made in to thick crepe. The technology used in the selected factory for the case study, the production procedure is in primitive stage and this result in low productivity with high environmental damage. The industry discharges large volume of waste water and effluents consisting of 34 000 litres of serum and 4 000 litres of wastewater per day. Though the company has a large Treatment plant, the effectiveness of it is totally inadequate due its high retention time. Few methodologies were used to find out the environmental damage by this factory, quantify the wastes and ways of maximum utilization of resources. Walk through audits; develop process flow charts, materials balance sheet, chemical analysis of raw material and the effluent and brainstorming are such methodologies. The application of Cleaner Production (CP), apart from reducing pollution load brings in many other benefits to this type of industry, which include resource conservation, improvement in work environment, product quality improvement etc. Cleaner production is not only concerned with technology, but also with management, labour, organization and health and safety. Cleaner production solutions will help to improve the industry's financial bottom line and mitigate environmental damage through helping the industry to survive. Fifteen cleaner production options were identified during the study. Waste free latex, de-arnrnoniation, avoidance o~ntaminates, control use of chemicals, improvement of coagulation process, technology improvement for skim separation, resource recovery, repair and maintenance, good house keeping, better storing of finished goods, modifying the air drying process, introduce proper drainage system for wastewater flowing, change the power generating system, and better scheduling are the identified CP options in the factory. Based on technical feasibility, financial viability and environmental desirability, an overall qualitative analysis was carried out for these options. According to the analysis the Proper mixing of skim latex with chemicals (Sulphuric acid), minimize rubber in waste streams, mechanized the skimming process, good house keeping practices (Introduce proper drainage system for w. water,separate and reuse water and storing finished goods) and de-ammoniating options were prioritised. The proposed pollution prevention ana pollution control measures would help to improve the environmental performance of <b>skim</b> <b>rubber</b> processing factories and grant resource conservation benefits to the industry...|$|E
40|$|Silver {{nanoparticles}} (AgNPs) were synthesized in <b>skim</b> natural <b>rubber</b> latex, the by-product from {{concentrated latex}} production. The role of ammonia was investigated by varying the concentration to be 0. 217, 0. 362, 0. 377, 0. 392, and 0. 406 [*]wt%. The emergence of AgNPs {{was detected by}} UV-visible spectrophotometer and electrical conductivity meter. Upon increasing ammonia concentration, the ABS peak increased to a maximum and slightly shifted to a higher wavelength and then it decreased afterward and slightly shifted to a lower wavelength. The shift of the ABS peak {{was consistent with the}} conductivity result. The kinetic model was proposed to explain the competition between the reducing effect and size-controlling effect of ammonia. The reducing effect seemed to dominate in the low range of concentration while the size-controlling effect via the formation of AgNH 32 + complex ion was important in the higher range. The TEM figures evidently confirmed the effects...|$|R
