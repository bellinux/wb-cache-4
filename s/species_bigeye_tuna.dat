The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate the stomach content of three tuna <b>species</b> (<b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna,</b> yellowfin tuna, and skipjack tuna), apex predator in the southern part of Eastern Indian Ocean. The study was conducted in March – April, 2010 on the basis of catches of commercial tuna longline vessel based in Port of Benoa. A total of 53 individual fishes were collected, consisting of bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus), yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacores), and skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis). Stomach specimens were collected and analyzed. Analysis was conducted on the basis of index of preponderance method. The diet of the three tuna species showed fishes as the main diet (56 – 82 %), followed by cephalopods (squids) as the complementary diet (0 – 8 %), and crustaceans (shrimps) as the additional diet (2 – 4 %).

40|$|We {{analyzed}} a 16 -year (1996 – 2011) {{time series}} of catch and effort data for 23 species with mean weights ranging from 0. 8 kg to 224 kg, recorded by {{observers in the}} Hawaii-based deep-set longline fishery. Over this time period, domestic fishing effort, as numbers of hooks set in the core Hawaii-based fishing ground, has increased fourfold. The standardized aggregated annual catch rate for 9 small (, 15 kg) species increased about 25 % while for 14 large species (. 15 kg) it decreased about 50 % over the 16 -year period. A size-based ecosystem model for the subtropical Pacific captures this pattern well {{as a response to}} increased fishing effort. Further, the model projects a decline in the abundance of fishes larger than 15 kg results in an increase in abundance of animals from 0. 1 to 15 kg but with minimal subsequent cascade to sizes smaller than 0. 1 kg. These results suggest that size-based predation {{plays a key role in}} structuring the subtropical ecosystem. These changes in ecosystem size structure show up in the fishery in various ways. The non-commercial species lancetfish (mean weight 7 kg) has now surpassed the target <b>species,</b> <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna,</b> as the species with the highest annual catch rate.

40|$|In the Hawaii-based {{longline}} fishery, {{changes in}} fishing operations to target different species produce {{changes in the}} effectiveness of fishing effort units. Catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) indices used in resource monitoring were improved by segregating dissimilar types of fishing effort. Cluster {{analysis was used to}} classify longline sets in relation to species composition of the catches. Based on proportions of eight species and three broader species groups in 46 961 longline sets from 4 years (1991 - 1994) of commercial fishery data, five effort clusters were identified. Spatial distribution of sets and differences in fishing operations among clusters were then compared to reveal apparent differences in fishing strategies. Three clusters comprised N 80 % of the total sets, and the catch compositions suggested targeting for either broadbill swordfish (two clusters) or bigeye tuna. The other two clusters were most similar to the tuna cluster, but their catch compositions indicated a mixed-species fishing strategy. Fishing operations were most different between sets in the tuna and swordfish clusters. Swordfish sets were characterized by (1) the largest vessels, (2) the least number of hooks per set, (3) the greatest number of lightsticks, (4) the longest set duration, (5) the highest percentage of night sets, (6) a larger percentage of sets within the full moon phase, and (7) the lowest percentage of sets within the main Hawaiian Islands Exclusive Economic Zone. Time series of CPUE for three <b>species</b> (<b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna,</b> yellowfin tuna, and swordfish) based on different clusters were compared, and the most appropriate CPUE time series for resource monitoring are recommended. 0 1997 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|I {{quantify}} {{the effects of}} 11 variables on the catchability of pelagic longlines, which are used to catch tunas and billfishes in the open ocean. Extension of the depth range and the duration of longline operations have reduced the catchability of several epipelagic species, such as mako sharks (Isurus spp.), since industrial longlining commenced in the tropical Pacific Ocean in the early 1950 s. Reductions in the body size of many species also resulted in reduced searching for food and fewer encounters with longline hooks. By contrast, the catchability of commercially valuable <b>species,</b> like <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna</b> (Thunnus obesus), increased substantially {{as a result of}} the extension of the depth range of longlines and the longer duration of fishing operations. Stronger and less visible line materials, new bait species, and skipper experience also contributed to increased catchability. Dedicated surveys should be used to obtain fishery independent estimates of abundance. Another option is to use surveys to measure variations in the relationship between longline catch rates and animal abundance...|$|R

However, currently available acoustic receivers require physical recovery of the units to download stored data. Such operation is often difficult in remote study areas like in the open ocean. We present a new satellite-linked acoustic receiver (Vemco VR 3 -Argos) that allows downloading data through a satellite uplink (Argos). The VR 3 -Argos can last up to one year, sending GPS positions and tag data at regular time intervals. We illustrate the advantages of this new technology with tagging data from 121 fish of seven <b>species</b> (yellowfin <b>tuna,</b> <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna,</b> skipjack tuna, wahoo, dolphinfish, silky shark and oceanic triggerfish) caught and released around drifting fish aggregating devices (FADs) in the Western Indian Ocean, far from any land.

40|$|Today, {{the tuna}} fishery {{of the western}} and central Pacific {{is one of the}} world's largest fisheries. Annual catches exceed 2 millionÂ mt [...] {{approximately}} 50 % of the global tuna catch [...] with an estimated landed value of USD 3 billion (in 2005). The fishery expanded rapidly from the mid 1980 s, following the development of the purse-seine fishery. From the mid 1990 s, it was recognised that a Regional Fisheries Management Organisation was required to facilitate cooperation in the management of the resource. Following almost a decade of negotiations and planning, the Western and Central Pacific Fishery Commission (WCPFC) was established in 2004. During the interim period, stock assessments for the key tuna species were developed and revealed that for two <b>species</b> (yellowfin and <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna)</b> there was concern regarding the increased levels of fishing mortality. However, declarations and resolutions calling for restraint in the expansion of fishing effort were largely unheeded over the last decade and, to date, the WCPFC has been unable to introduce any measures to effectively reduce (or limit) the level of fishing mortality on yellowfin and <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna.</b> This paper proposes a number of mechanisms for improving the performance of the WCPFC with respect to meeting the conservation and management objectives of the commission and argues that Pacific Island nations need to collectively take the lead to ensure the effective management of the resource.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to address a {{shortage}} of reliable CPUE information, and as a preliminary step to a broader observer program, Indonesia established a Trial Observer Program (TOP) for the industrial tuna long line fishery based at Benoa Fishing Port, Bali, in mid 2005. The objectives of this paper are i) to describe spatial and temporal catch and effort trends from the Indonesian Indian Ocean industrial tuna long line fishery based at Benoa Fishing Port, and ii) to provide {{an understanding of the}} fishing strategies used by different companies and of the environmental conditions that may influence catch trends. The observed effort covered areas both north and south of 20 °S, with a concentration within 10 °- 20 °S; 105 °- 120 °E which overlaps with the only known spawning grounds of southern bluefin tuna (SBT).

40|$|Pacific <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna</b> {{are subject}} to {{overfishing}} Pacific-wide and this document sets out alternatives that {{might be used to}} end overfishing. <b>Bigeye</b> <b>tuna,</b> like other highly migratory species (HMS) are nomadic in behavior, thus do not recognize boundaries that management, policy, or science have established. <b>Bigeye</b> <b>tuna</b> are fished by many nations in addition the United States, thus future efforts to reduce fishing mortality on <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna</b> in the Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) will require coordination and communication among all relevant regional fisheries stakeholders. The capacity for unilateral action by the United States to prevent overfishing, as required under National Standard 1 of the Magnuson-Stevens Act (16 U. S. C. 1851 (a) (1), is limited, as is the capacity of the Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council), which is required to develop a plan to end overfishing, under 50 CFR 600. 310 (e) (4) (i)). Pacific-wide, the U. S. annually lands approximately 200, 000 metric tons (mt), or about five percent of the total bigeye catch. The Pacific-wide catch for <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna</b> in the EPO between years 1999 and 2003 was between 88, 000 mt and 142, 000 mt. The U. S.

Multilateral management action is essential to ensure that overfishing on <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna</b> in the Pacific Ocean ends. The current resolution that places conservation and management measures on fishing nations in the EPO for <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna</b> is set to expire in 2006, thus this document provides future management options that would address overfishing of Pacific <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna</b> in the EPO.

40|$|ABSTRACTBackground: In {{addition}} to parvalbumin, the well- known major allergen in fish, collagen was recently {{identified as a}} new allergen in the muscle of <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna</b> and in the skin of several species of fish. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate fish muscle colla- gens for their reactivity with IgE in fish-allergic patients and antigenic cross-reactivity. Methods: Collagen was purified from the white muscle of five species of fish (Japanese eel, alfonsin, mackerel, skipjack and <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna)</b> by acid extraction and salt precipitation, whereas parvalbumin was purified from <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna</b> by gel filtration and reverse- phase HPLC. The IgE reactivities to collagen and parvalbumin were examined by ELISA, whereas antigenic cross-reactivity among fish muscle collagens was investigated by ELISA inhibition experiments. Results: When 15 sera from fish-allergic patients were subjected to ELISA using <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna</b> collagen and parvalbumin, 10 sera reacted only to parvalbumin, two reacted only to collagen, two reacted to both collagen and parvalbumin and one reacted to neither collagen nor parvalbumin. The sera containing specific IgE to <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna</b> collagen also reacted to collagens from the other four species of fish. In the ELISA inhibition experiments, <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna</b> collagen inhibited the binding of IgE not only to <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna</b> collagen, but also to that from the other four species of fish, suggesting cross-reactivity among the collagens from five species of fish.

5000|$|<b>Bigeye</b> <b>tuna</b> {{undertake}} a distinct diel shift in vertical behaviour, generally descending at dawn to deeper, cooler waters {{and returning to}} shallower, warmer waters at dusk. During the day they can undertake vertical movements into waters of 300-500 m depth that can be as low as 20 °C than surface temperatures. Individuals undertake thermoregulatory behaviour whilst at depth, periodically returning from deeper, cooler waters to shallower, warmer waters to re-warm. Across the Pacific Ocean the depths at which <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna</b> spend {{the majority of their}} time during the day vary: in the eastern Pacific the majority of time is spent at 200-350 m; around Hawaii the majority of time is spent at 300-400 m and in the Coral Sea the majority of time is spent at 300-500 m. These suggest that <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna</b> (or their prey) are tracking an optimum temperature (10-15 °C) which is shallower in the eastern Pacific Ocean than in the western Pacific Ocean.

Differences between the studies will be discussed, particularly as they pertain to determining applicability to Atlantic <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna</b> stocks. The age (cohort) slicing technique used for the last (2002) ICCAT SCRS <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna</b> stock assessment was applied using various growth models to produce alternative catch-at-age matrices. The proportional changes between these matrices are examined. The results of this examination indicate that even moderate differences in the growth curves used to perform age-slicing produce dramatic differences in the catch-at-age matrices. The potential implications for age-structured stock assessment are considered...|$|R

40|$|Examining {{the stomach}} {{contents}} of the yellwfin and the <b>bigeye</b> <b>tunas</b> obtained {{in the western part}} of South Pacific Ocean for about thirty days, October 1958, and the following results were obtained; (1) In the Fiji area, there occured many fish having rather empty stomach than in the other area, therefore, this area seems to be poor in food organisms. (2) Food organisms found in the stomach amounted to about 27 kind (c. f. Table 4), being remarkably poor than in the equatorial region. Among them, Alepisaurids, Carangids, Lepidotids, Paralepids, Ostraciontids, Balistids, Cephalopods and Macruran shrimps occupied more than 10 %, respectively. These are probably the most important as prey of tunas in the Fiji area. (3) Coelenterates were rather abundant in the Fiji area than in the region to the north of 20 °S. (4) There differences of food-habit among both fish in respects of certain kind of preys. Several deep sea fish, such as Paralepids and Alepisaurids, occured in the <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna</b> at higher frequency than in the yellowfin tuna. Others, such as Chiasmodontids and Sternoptychids occured in the <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna,</b> being absent in the yellowfin tuna. Several surface sea fish, such as Carangids, Scombrids, Clupeids and Ostraciontids, on the contrary, were found more abundant in the yellowfin <b>tuna</b> than the <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna.</b> Others, such as Balistids, Molids, Coryphaenids and the youngs of Katsuwonids were not seen in the <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna.</b> From the mentioned above, it will be presumed that the <b>bigeye</b> <b>tuna</b> may be essentially the resident in slightly deeper layer compared with the yellowfin tuna. ﻿フイジー海域におけるマグロ類の胃内容物の特徴として下記の傾向が認められた. 1. 赤道から南北にへだたる程,空胃が多くなる. 従って,この海域はマグロ類にとって餌料となるべき生物の量が少ないものと考えられる. 2. 本海域に見られた餌料生物は約 27 種で,赤道海域より種類が顕著に少ない. そのうち, 10 %以上の高い出現率を示したpreyはミズウオ科・アジ科・シマガツオ科・ハダカエソ科・モンガラカワハギ科・ハコフグ科の魚類 6 種とイカ類・エビ類で,本海域の鮪類の餌料として重要な﻿占めるものと思われる. 3. クラゲ類は他の海域より高い出現率を示した. 4. 数種の餌料について,キハダとメバチにかなり顕著な食性の相異が認められた. 深海性のハダカエソ科・ミズウオ科はメバチにその出現割合が大きい. 深海性のムネエソ科・クロバウズギス科はメバチに出現し,キハダではその出現を見なかった. 表層性のモンガラカワハギ科・マンボ科・シイラ科及びカツオ若年魚はキハダには見られ,メバチには出現を見なかった. 又,表層性のアジ科・サバ科・イワシ科・ハコフグ科がキハダにその出現割合が大きい. 以上の傾向から,メバチの棲息分布はキハダより深い層にあるということが考えられる...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} El Niño–Southern Oscillation events on catches of <b>Bigeye</b> <b>Tuna</b> (Thunnus obesus) {{in the eastern}} Indian Ocean (EIO) off Java were {{evaluated}} {{through the use of}} remotely sensed environmental data (sea-surface-height anomaly [SSHA], sea-surface temperature [SST], and chlorophyll a concentration), and <b>Bigeye</b> <b>Tuna</b> catch data. Analyses were conducted for the period of 1997 – 2000, which included the 1997 – 98 El Niño and 1999 – 2000 La Niña events. The empirical orthogonal function (EOF) was applied to examine oceanographic parameters quantitatively. The relationship of those parameters to variations in catch distribution of <b>Bigeye</b> <b>Tuna</b> was explored with a generalized additive model (GAM). The mean hook rate was 0. 67 during El Niño and 0. 44 during La Niña, and catches were high where SSHA ranged from – 21 to 5 cm, SST ranged from 24 °C to 27. 5 °C, and chlorophyll-a concentrations ranged from 0. 04 to 0. 16 mg m– 3. The EOF analysis confirmed that the 1997 – 98 El Niño affected oceanographic conditions in the EIO off Java. The GAM results indicated that SST was better than the other environmental factors (SSHA and chlorophyll-a concentration) as an oceanographic predictor of <b>Bigeye</b> <b>Tuna</b> catches in the region. According to the GAM predictions, the highest probabilities (70 – 80 %) for <b>Bigeye</b> <b>Tuna</b> catch in 1997 – 2000 occurred during oceanographic conditions during the 1997 – 98 El Niño event...|$|R
