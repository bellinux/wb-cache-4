The pathofysiology includes reduced food intake, maldigestion and malabsorption but also avoidable iatrogenic factors, such as prescribed fasting, frequent paracenteses and "liver-diets" poor in fat and protein. Liver insufficiency corresponds {{to a state of}} accelerated starvation. The diminished glucose tolerance and low glycogen stores in cirrhotic patients result in a reduced availability of glucose as energy source. The prevalence of undernutrition depends upon the severity of the liver insufficiency and the method of nutritional assessment. The aim of the nutritional plan is to realize a sufficient oral diet which includes enough proteins and calories. Several extra calorie supplements are indicated to surmount the lack of available glucose. The evidence in support of branched chain amino acid supplements is limited.

It was discovered that such oscillations can be connected with business cycles dynamic, only that electricity prices oscillations proved to be even stronger unless a major technological breakthrough occurs in the way energy is produced or spent. Economic growth affects electricity prices even in relative terms, causes growth in prices with respect to inflation and vice versa.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a wetland water balance model for use in a large river basin with many different wetlands. The basic model was primarily developed for a single wetland with a complex water management system involving large amounts of specialized input data and water management details. The aim was to simplify the model structure and to use only commonly available data as input for the model, with the least possible loss of accuracy. Results from different variants of the model and data adaptation were tested against results from a detailed model. This shows that using commonly available data and unifying and simplifying the input data is tolerable up to a certain level. The simplification of the model has greater effects on the evaluated water balance components than the data adaptation. Because this simplification was necessary for large-scale use, we suggest that, for reasons of comparability, simpler models should always be applied with uniform data bases for large regions, though these <b>should</b> only <b>be</b> <b>moderately</b> simplified. Further, we recommend using these simplified models only for large-scale comparisons and using more specific, detailed models for investigations on smaller scales...|$|R

However, it has generally {{high levels of}} mercury (Hg). The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the bioaccessibility of mercury in this species subjected to different culinary treatments (fried, grilled and steamed). The content of Hg and the proximate chemical composition were quantified in raw and cooked samples and the samples were also subjected to simulated digestive tract. The results revealed that the culinary treatments affected the chemical composition of black {{scabbard fish}} due to water loss and consequent concentration of other nutrients. All biometric parameters analyzed did not influence the Hg content. However, for culinary treatments, grilled fish showed higher levels of Hg, with 80 % of samples above the limit set by the EU. The values of provisional tolerable weekly intake showed that fried, boiled and steamed black scabbard fish <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>moderately</b> eaten by pregnant women and children as they are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of Hg. A higher Hg bioaccessibility was observed in raw fish samples compared to cooked samples. Intestine was the digestion step where bioaccessible Hg reached the highest levels for absorption.

40|$|The work of {{previous}} investigators {{gives the impression}} that it is easy to produce sera which both in vitro and upon injection are leukotoxic. At the same time the specificity of these leukotoxic sera for the particular type of cell used as antigen, and even for leukocytes in general, has been doubtful. The methods used have made certain possible factors of error unavoidable. Even careful washing of an organ or suspension cannot render it wholly blood-free, so that {{it is not surprising that}} the sera <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>moderately</b> hemolytic and hemagglutinative. Pearce has shown that the injection of very small amounts of blood is sufficient to evoke the production of immune hemolysins. When such sera are injected the lesions, as Pearce states, may be due in part to the production of hemagglutinative thrombi, although this hardly seems to apply to the changes in lymphoid tissue described by Flexner. On the other hand, the lymphotoxic effect of hemolytic sera may be due to the lymphocytes injected with the red cells. Our own experiments indicate that the lymphotoxic and agglutinative factors are to a considerable degree distinct from the hemolytic and hemagglutinative ones, since they can be separated from one another by absorption. Further evidence is presented that the small thymus cells are biologically related to, if not identical with the lymphocytes derived from lymph glands...|$|R

40|$|Anomalies in the {{large-scale}} CMB temperature sky measured by WMAP {{have been suggested}} as possible evidence for a violation of statistical isotropy on large scales. In any physical model for broken isotropy, there are testable consequences for the CMB polarization field. We develop simulation tools for predicting the polarization field in models that break statistical isotropy locally through a modulation field. We study two different models: dipolar modulation, invoked to explain the asymmetry in power between northern and southern ecliptic hemispheres, and quadrupolar modulation, posited to explain the alignments between the quadrupole and octopole. For the dipolar case, we show that predictions for {{the correlation between the}} first 10 multipoles of the temperature and polarization fields can typically be tested at better than the 98 % CL. For the quadrupolar case, we show that the polarization quadrupole and octopole <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>moderately</b> aligned. Such an alignment is a generic prediction of explanations which involve the temperature field at recombination and thus discriminate against explanations involving foregrounds or local secondary anisotropy. Predicted correlations between temperature and polarization multipoles out to l = 5 provide tests at the ~ 99 % CL or stronger for quadrupolar models that make the temperature alignment more than a few percent likely. As predictions of anomaly models, polarization statistics move beyond the a posteriori inferences that currently dominate the field.

40|$|The detections of X-ray {{emission}} {{from the}} kiloparsec-scale jets of blazars and radio galaxies may imply {{the existence of}} high energy electrons in these extended jets, and these electrons could produce high energy emission through inverse Compton (IC) process. In this paper we study the non-variable hard TeV emission from a blazar. The multi-band emission consists of two components: one is the traditional synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission from the inner jet, {{and the other is}} the emission produced via SSC and IC scattering of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons (IC/CMB) and extragalactic background light (EBL) photons (IC/EBL) by relativistic electrons in the extended jet under the stochastic acceleration scenario. Such a model is applied to 1 ES 1101 - 232. The results indicate that (1) the non-variable hard TeV emission of 1 ES 1101 - 232 can be reproduced well, which is dominated by IC/CMB emission from the extended jet, using three characteristic values of Doppler factor (δ_ D= 5, 10, 15) for the TeV emitting region in the extended jet; and (2) in the cases of δ_ D= 15 and 10, the physical parameters can achieve the equipartition (or quasi-equipartition) between the relativistic electrons and the magnetic field; In contrast, the physical parameters largely deviate from the equipartition for the case of δ_ D= 5.
