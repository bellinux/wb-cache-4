In the song, Björk also lyrically [...] "celebrates the workings of anatomy". In an interview with Radio X, Björk said that in fact the lyrics were [...] "probably about just celebrating the body; cells doing rollercoaster rides up and down your body, in the blood and the lungs. Just singing". With Interview magazine, whilst asked about the song's lyrics, the singer stated that,"I always think I'm saying something really upfront and direct. I guess through the years, I've probably done a lot of alternative medicine like acupuncture. I'm probably interested in the Chinese things overall. But that song is actually about that because—I don't know if you understand this—but I have a tendency to finish my kidney energy. It's my weakness. And if you kick your heels into the earth, you send back the kidney energy. So I was trying to have one verse about that, and one verse about oxygen, and one verse about the nerves".|$|R

Summer is perhaps the biggest change of pace with a nice downtempo beat, but at times the <b>sub</b> <b>bass</b> can almost be overwhelming for the slower tempo and context." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} {{music and}} professional audio creation, a DirectX plugin is a software processing component {{that can be}} loaded as a plugin into host applications to allow real-time processing, audio effects, mixing audio or act as virtual synthesizers.

[...] Heat Karen Edwards rated the album four out of five, saying [...] "The boys switch lead vocal duties throughout, and from indie ballad 'Golden', the sweet pop sounds of 'Heart Vacancy' and the Kings of Leon-inspired 'Lose My Mind' ... to the cheeky Midwest style of 'Let's Get Ugly', there are plenty of different sounds to enjoy. ... There's something for everyone on The Wanted - not just for the teenie-boppers among us." [...] Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music felt the album had plenty of highs and lows, and stated, [...] "There are signs of pop evolution at work within the genes of this lot. ... Arresting songs, with masses of personality - like the swoony, choral & Low, or the downright Wild Beasts-y Golden - sit next to the formulaic (but y’know, fine) Say It on the Radio or Personal Soldier: the very acme of nothing ventured, nothing gained." ...|$|E
5000|$|Simultaneously a new {{genre of}} rap {{was about to}} emerge, which was much more built upon the unique {{features}} of Hungarian language in rhyming, word-plays, jokes and ambiguities. First it {{was developed by the}} RAPülők (1992-1994) and then by the hip hop duo Animal Cannibals beginning from 1995. In the same year their first single [...] "Takarítónő" [...] (Eng.: Cleaning Lady) was a hit with radio and TV airplay. They were the first Hungarian group ever to get played in MCM a French music TV station (single [...] "Kérek egy puszikát!"). Their success inspired many upcoming groups and by utilizing their fame Animal Cannibals launched a new series of MC battles nationwide in local clubs called the Fila Rap Jam in 1996. Its goal is to invite the winners to Budapest into a final contest in which the champion selected by the audience is given a record deal. One of their first newfound talents was <b>Sub</b> <b>Bass</b> Monster, whose first album Félre az útból (Eng.: Get out of the way) went platinum in 2000 and the second one gold in 2001. An example of his funny metaphors is the title of his third single [...] "Négy Ütem" [...] (Eng.: Four Strokes) that was a reference to the four steps of breathing in marihuana.

5000|$|Through {{connections}} {{made at the}} Starck Club, Squillante eventually {{landed a}} job working for the Resource Record Pool in Los Angeles. He moved to the city in 1989 and was hired at Virgin Records in Beverly Hills, which became a directorship of Virgin's dance department in New York. In 1993, Squillante was {{the executive producer of}} a Virgin Records compilation album, Aural Opiates, which included tracks by Heaven 17 and Massive Attack (reviewed in Issue No. 2 of CMJ New Music Monthly). During this time, Squillante helped Janet Jackson's career become an international success and was awarded his own label imprint, Virgin Underground (VU), dedicated to innovative club-based music. The label creation was triggered by the success of a one-off underground club single Squillante signed from Philadelphia techno/house DJ and producer Josh Wink, released under his Size 9 alter ego, entitled [...] "I Am Ready." [...] The record topped the Billboard Dance Chart and became a pop success throughout Europe. [...] "That little record - which no one expected a lot from - was suddenly a huge international hit", Squillante told Billboard in January 1997. [...] "The next step was {{to see if we could}} make that happen again." [...] He moved to New York City and Virgin Underground released singles from Swedish producer DJ Pierre J, Los Angeles-based Groove Junkies, and, most notably [...] "Spin Spin Sugar" [...] from British trip-hop forerunners Sneaker Pimps. The club mixes, released on Virgin Underground featured a reworking from New York producer and remixer Armand Van Helden. Heavily influenced by the burgeoning UK drum and bass movement, Van Helden incorporated its trademark <b>sub</b> <b>bass</b> sounds into his rugged [...] "Dark Garage Remix." [...] The record peaked at #2 on the U.S. Billboard Dance Chart, but caused a sensation in the UK. Many credible DJs, producers and dance music historians cite it as the record that invented [...] "speed garage", a house music subgenre popular in the late 1990s, characterized by skittering four-on-the-floor beats and deep, oozing bass parts. Despite these successes, music industry mergers and cutbacks put VU Records on the chopping block and Squillante was eventually laid off by Virgin Records in 1998. During the following years, he was not involved in the music or DJ industry, and most people acquainted with him said he simply [...] "dropped out of the scene." ...|$|E

When the electronic music genre dubstep became known to people in Europe mainly during 2004 to 2006 from South London, England with artists such as Kode 9, Burial, Mala and Shackleton; Only few labels were releasing dubstep music and it was determined as the underground genre of electronic music. Basically, the sound of dubstep features syncopated drum and percussion patterns with bass lines that contain jutting <b>sub</b> <b>bass</b> frequencies. What to comes visual part of it, dubstep has always had its own minimal and murky aesthetics. The time has definitely changed since then. Many of the artists from that time cannot nowadays admit that they are making dubstep music, and there are new names for the sub-levels of the genre such as bass music and post-dubstep. This is only because of the sudden enormous popularity of the genre, and the fact that it has become a part of the mainstream. There are still a few labels that focus on keeping the original style of dubstep available for the audience that needs it, and one of them is the American record label Paradise Lost Recordings. This Master’s thesis, Case Study: Paradise Lost - Visual Expedition to the Identity of Record Label, is literally an expedition to the visual essence of the current label, but instead of a machete, matches and malaria medicine, I am using sketches, mindmaps and drawings to reach my destination - the rebirth of the visual identity of Paradise Lost Recordings for their 5 th anniversary.
