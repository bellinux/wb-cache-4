[...] Goya's yard is overwhelmingly stark, showing shackled inmates enclosed by high walls and a heavy stone arch. Inmates fight and grin idiotically or huddle in despair, all bathed in an oppressive grey and green light, guarded by a single man. The work stands as a horrifying and imaginary vision of loneliness, fear and social alienation, a departure from the rather more superficial treatment of mental illness in the works of earlier artists such as Hogarth.|$|R
40|$|Paper {{published}} in the June 2001 issue of World Economy. Five years ago, European officials proposed the negotiation of a transatlantic free trade area (TAFTA) linking the United States and the European Union in the world’s largest free trade zone. Flush from their successful conclusion of extensive multilateral trade reforms in the Uruguay Round, it seemed logical that the two leaders of the world trading system could work together to resolve their remaining trade problems {{and in the process}} set powerful precedents {{for the rest of the}} world to follow. In so doing, they would accelerate progress toward the ultimate goal of “global free trade”. Transatlantic free trade seemed such an easy task. Bilateral trade and investment was already large and largely unfettered (except in agriculture) and the proposals garnered support from both business and labor organizations. After the acrimonious debate over the ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), proponents felt that the TAFTA would not raise the same concerns about <b>social</b> and environmental <b>dumping</b> that nearly killed the North American pact. However, the initial fervor for such talks soon dissipated when it became clear that sharp differences in U...|$|R

60|$|It was by our {{captured}} crusader {{that the}} vicar found us. He came {{round the corner}} at us briskly, {{a little out of}} breath. He had an air of having been running after us since the first toot of our horn had warned the village of our presence. He was an Oxford man, clean-shaven, with a cadaverous complexion and a guardedly respectful manner, a cultivated intonation, and a general air of accommodation to the new order of things. These Oxford men are the Greeks of our plutocratic empire. He was a Tory in spirit, and what one may call an adapted Tory by stress of circumstances; that is to say, he was no longer a legitimist; he was prepared for the substitution of new lords for old. We were pill vendors he knew, and no doubt horribly vulgar in soul; but then it might have been some polygamous Indian rajah, a great strain on a good man's tact, or some Jew with an inherited expression of contempt. Anyhow, we were English, and neither Dissenters nor Socialists, and he was cheerfully prepared to do what he could to make gentlemen of both of us. He might have preferred Americans for some reasons; they are not so obviously taken from one part of the <b>social</b> system and <b>dumped</b> down in another, and they are more teachable; but in this world we cannot always be choosers. So he was very bright and pleasant with us, showed us the church, gossiped informingly about our neighbours on the countryside--Tux, the banker; Lord Boom, the magazine and newspaper proprietor; Lord Carnaby, that great sportsman, and old Lady Osprey. And finally he took us by way of a village lane--three children bobbed convulsively with eyes of terror for my uncle--through a meticulous garden to a big, slovenly Vicarage with faded Victorian furniture and a faded Victorian wife, who gave us tea and introduced us to a confusing family dispersed among a lot of disintegrating basket chairs upon the edge of a well-used tennis lawn.|$|R
5000|$|Social insects {{have evolved}} {{an array of}} {{sanitary}} behaviours to keep their nests clean, thereby reducing the probability of parasite establishment and spread within the colony. Such behaviours can be employed either prophylactically, or actively, upon demand. For example, social insects can incorporate materials with antimicrobial properties into their nest, such as conifer resin, or faecal pellets that contain symbiont derived antimicrobials. These materials reduce the growth and density of many detrimental bacteria and fungi. Antimicrobial substances can also be self-produced. Secretions from the metapleural glands of ants and volatile chemical components produced by termites {{have been shown to}} inhibit fungal germination and growth. Another important component of nest hygiene is waste management, which involves strict spatial separation of clean nest areas and waste <b>dumps.</b> <b>Social</b> insect colonies often deposit their waste outside of the nest, or in special compartments, including waste chambers for food leftovers, “toilets” for defecation and “graveyards”, where dead individuals are deposited, reducing the probability of parasite transmission from potentially infected cadavers. Where social insects place their waste is also important. For example, leaf cutting ants living in xeric conditions deposit their waste outside the nest, whilst species living in the tropics tend to keep it in special chambers within the nest. It has been proposed that this difference is related to the likelihood that the external environment reduces or enhances microbial growth. For xeric-living ants, placing waste outside will tend to inhibit infectious material, as microbes are usually killed under hot, dry conditions. On the other hand, placing waste into warm, humid environments will promote microbial growth and disease transmission, so it may be safer for ants living in the topics to contain their waste within the nest. Honeybees have evolved the ability to actively maintain a constant temperature within their hives to ensure optimal brood development. Upon exposure to Ascoshpaera apis, a heat sensitive fungal pathogen that causes chalk brood, honeybees increase the temperature of the brood combs, thereby creating conditions that disfavour the growth of the pathogen. This [...] "social fever" [...] is performed before symptoms of the disease are expressed and can therefore be viewed as a preventative measure to avoid chalk brood outbreaks in the colony.|$|R

50|$|<b>Social</b> <b>dumping</b> is a {{term that}} is used to {{describe}} a practice of employers to use cheaper labour than is usually available at their site of production and/or sale. In the latter case, migrant workers are employed; in the former, production is moved to a low-wage country or area. The entrepreneur will thus save money and potentially increase his profit. Systemic criticism suggests that as a result, governments are tempted to enter a so-called social policy regime competition by reducing their labour and social standards to ease labour costs on enterprises and to retain business activity within their jurisdiction.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{investigate}} the scalar nature of <b>social</b> <b>dumping</b> in civil aviation. Through the use of documents and interviews, this thesis investigates the labor strategies of Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA. This thesis has two goals. The first {{is to create a}} deeper understanding of the concept of <b>social</b> <b>dumping,</b> a concept which lacks a common definition or understanding in the literature. This thesis provides an overview of the concept, and also provides a scalar framework of <b>social</b> <b>dumping</b> to help better understand the phenomenon that the term is trying to describe. By understanding the scalar relationship between civil aviation’s labor market, the state and organized labor, the potential for <b>social</b> <b>dumping</b> within an industry can be better understood. The second {{purpose of this}} thesis is to conduct a scalar analysis of <b>social</b> <b>dumping</b> in civil aviation. The thesis argues that when conducted, <b>social</b> <b>dumping</b> has an up-scaling effect on the scale of the civil aviation industry and its labor market, and a down-scaling effect on the state and organized labor. In addition, this thesis also provides further evidence for the argument that controlling the scale of labor negotiations is an effective tool for all actors involved in any labor relationships, further demonstrating the affect that scale can have on the practice of <b>social</b> <b>dumping.</b> M-I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract <b>Social</b> <b>dumping</b> This {{project is}} about the new {{phenomenon}} called <b>social</b> <b>dumping.</b> In this project, we try to analyse <b>social</b> <b>dumping</b> on a national scale and on a more complex and bigger scale – in a European perspective. <b>Social</b> <b>dumping</b> is an expression used in connection with foreign workers whose wages and working conditions lie below {{the standards of the}} employees, who are citizens in the country where the foreign worker is employed. Based on the results of our project, we conclude that <b>social</b> <b>dumping</b> in a late modern society as Denmark is problematic, because it violates the Danish labor agreements in relation to wages and working conditions. We also conclude via Theory of Complexity that Denmark {{as a member of the}} European Union is part of a larger and more complex system where Denmark as a part of Europe that functions as a single organisation to compete with other countries worldwide. We conclude from the results of our project that in a larger and more complex system that there are many more elements that play a major role in the context of the whole...|$|E
40|$|This paper aims at {{explaining}} why the institutional {{integration in the}} EU creates <b>social</b> <b>dumping</b> in Denmark.

Concepts from Historical Institutionalism such as spill-over and Rational Choice Institutionalisms principal-agent theory, is applied to identify and explain the institutional mechanisms embedded in the posting of workers directive and how these are expressed in the European Court of Justice’s interpretation of the directive in the Laval ruling (C- 341 / 05). We have included Fritz W. Scharpf’s interpretation of positive and negative integration in our analysis of how the asymmetry between these leads to <b>social</b> <b>dumping,</b> since they limit the possibility for regulation by the Member States.
