2500|$|Coming back to Japan {{after his}} {{doctoral}} studies, Motora was named {{principal of the}} Tokyo Eiwa School. Shortly thereafter, he also took a part-time faculty position at the Imperial University of Tokyo. In 1889, Motora presented a lecture on evolutionary theory at the Tokyo Eiwa School. The school had been founded by Methodist missionaries, and Motora's lecture ran afoul of the religious tradition there. Motora resigned from the school, devoting his attention to lecturing full-time at the Imperial University. By 1890, Motora authored Psychology, the first Japanese <b>scientific</b> <b>textbook</b> in his field. The same year, Motora was promoted {{to the rank of}} professor at the Imperial University, though there was not a full psychology department at the time. He was named the chair of psychology, ethics and logic three years later.|$|E

40|$|From 1900 to 1911, a {{large number}} of <b>scientific</b> <b>textbooks</b> for primary and {{secondary}} schools from foreign countries were translated into Chinese for the purpose of introducing science education in China. These translated books have since exerted a great influence on the Chinese society. Adopting the descriptive-functional methodology and with reference to statistical analysis, this paper describes and examines this translation phenomenon, including the historical-cultural context which affected and constrained the translation selections of such textbooks, the translating process, and their criticism and social functions. The paper concludes that translated <b>scientific</b> <b>textbooks</b> influence both the surface and deep structures of Chinese traditional culture, and that their criticism should be integrated into the cultural background in order that the criticism becomes more inclusive, scientific and objective...|$|R

40|$|Though {{the notion}} of a <b>scientific</b> <b>textbook</b> has been around for almost three centuries, the {{category}} has hardly been stable. The plasticity of the textbook genre may be illustrated by recent variations as well as long-term trends.

40|$|We are {{suggesting}} {{a framework for}} open access publishing of comprehensive, elaborately structured digital textbooks, potentially enriched by extensive non-textual data. The framework will comprise of a software toolbox containing a collaborative authoring platform, manuscript workflow system, tools for editorial work, presentation platform, updating workflow, interfaces for dissemination and long-term preservation. In addition to the software toolbox itself, guidelines and standards for all aspects of digital textbook publishing, including peer review, metadata and editorial procedures, legal issues {{as well as a}} business model will be developed, resulting in a best practice guide to digital textbook publishing. The software and workflows will not be developed from scratch, but build upon existing open-source software, using the example of a <b>scientific</b> <b>textbook</b> of hand surgery as its first use case.

40|$|A {{textbook}} lesson may be {{made more}} interesting by promoting emotional interest through adding entertaining text and illustrations or by promoting cognitive interest through adding signals for structural understanding such as summary illustrations with captions. In Experi-ment 1, skilled readers who read summary text and illustrations {{about the process of}} lightning performed worse on retention of important information and on transfer when entertaining text, illustrations, or both were added. In Experiment 2, skilled readers rated entertaining text and illustrations relatively high in emotional interest and low in cognitive interest and rated summary illustrations and text relatively low in emotional interest and high in cognitive interest. The results suggest benefits of cognitive interest over emotional interest for helping students learn scientific explanations. What can be done to make a <b>scientific</b> <b>textbook</b> lesson more interesting? For example, consider the following sce-nario. A high school textbook contains a six-paragraph lesson that explains the formation of lightning, such as shown in the Appendix. Students find the passage boring...|$|E

The examination of the textbooks show, that the presentation of the personalities do follow rather the political patterns whereas the presentation of the question whoever has been responsible varies depending on the time.

40|$|Background and purpose: Two {{important}} clinical education {{methods are}} problem-based and student-centered. However, education of “clinical decision-making skills” and “application of clinical knowledge” is important. Usually training these cases {{is done in}} small groups. In this study, new method of <b>scientific</b> <b>textbooks</b> with four factors mentioned above has been implemented in large education groups and its effectiveness has been evaluated. Methods: In scientific literature teaching sessions to 50 gynecology specialist residents of a type 1 university in Iran, problem-based and student-centered education is applied from textbooks by asking questions to “increase decision-making skills” and “application of clinical knowledge”. Designing of the questions was done in five-step process including design-thinking, response based on previous information, design multiple choice questions, thinking again, referring to textbooks proper answer and discussion-final conclusion by the coordinator in large educational groups (up to 50) runs in a 2 -year period and then evaluated by learners, managers and graduates' investigation. Results: The evaluation of learners (Gynecology residents) satisfaction was 89 %, decision-making skill increase was 82 %, clinical application skill increase of scientific matters was 74 %, textbooks understanding increase was 83 % and answering skill increase to exam questions was 79 %. Managers' opinion (3 people) was excellent about the process. In examining graduates in the two-year period, 2 people achieved first and fifth rank in national gynecology board {{that both of them}} considered the attending classes important in their success. Conclusions: New method of <b>scientific</b> <b>textbooks</b> with the use of “problem-based” and “student-centered” education in large educational groups was effective and satisfactory for the learners.
