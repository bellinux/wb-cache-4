25|$|Arava Power Company (APC) is a {{solar energy}} company founded in 2006 on Ketura in the Arava Valley. On June 5, 2011, APC inaugurated Israel’s first medium sized <b>solar</b> <b>field,</b> Ketura Sun. The field {{stretches}} over 80 dunams (8 hectares or 20 acres) {{of land and}} has an installed power of 4.95MW. As Arava Power is an environmentally conscious company, it installs solar fields only on land zoned solely for agricultural or industrial use.|$|E
25|$|Arava Power Company is {{committed}} to corporate social responsibility. Within the Torah’s rules for Tzedakah (charitable giving) is the law of Pe'ah. Pe’ah requires that {{the four corners of}} any field be left untouched by harvesters and saved for the poor to glean. Arava Power Company is giving Pe’ah a modern twist, dedicating the four corners of the Ketura Sun <b>solar</b> <b>field</b> to four different non-profit organizations that will benefit from the funds earned by each corner for the next 20 years.|$|E
2500|$|Ketura Sun is {{the first}} {{commercial}} medium size <b>solar</b> <b>field</b> in Israel, {{as well as the}} first <b>solar</b> <b>field</b> in the Middle East. The <b>solar</b> <b>field</b> is built on the premises of Ketura, an income-sharing community in the Arava Valley, in the south of Israel about 45 minutes north of Eilat. This location has some of the highest levels of solar radiation in the world {{and at the same time}} enables a direct connection to Israel’s national grid.|$|E

40|$|To slow climate change, humans {{should take}} {{immediate}} and widespread action. One way to slow {{climate change is}} by switching to switch to renewable power plants such as <b>solar</b> <b>fields.</b> Recently, pioneering companies have built <b>solar</b> <b>fields</b> on water bodies. This study found that such a pairing of water and solar could increase production efficiency by 8 - 10 % through panel cooling, save millions {{of liters of water}} from evaporation, and produce energy with under-utilized space...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{elucidate}} a possible role of the <b>solar</b> magnetic <b>field</b> in the formation of the stationary solar wind (SW). An analysis of the SW proton velocities measured by Ulysses for the period of ~ 1. 5 activity cycle in combination with SW speed IPS-observations as well as the XUV corona images and <b>solar</b> magnetic <b>field</b> data has been performed. The main result of this study is the finding of inverse relation between the SW speeds and <b>solar</b> magnetic <b>field</b> strengths: the stronger the closed magnetic fields the slower the solar wind and vice versa, that points to direct interactions of the solar wind plasma flows with <b>solar</b> magnetic <b>fields.</b> Thus, <b>solar</b> magnetic <b>fields</b> are responsible not only for the solar corona formation via plasma trapping and heating but also for the SW velocity ranging. A few examples of SW velocity – <b>solar</b> magnetic <b>field</b> connection are presented...|$|R
2500|$|... "When {{we started}} this project, nobody had really looked at doing {{projects}} of this scale. Then you realise it's much more efficient to build your <b>solar</b> <b>field</b> {{on the ground in}} the middle of the desert. You can send a man to brush them off every day, rather than having to access everyone's buildings individually, and you can make sure that they are running at their absolute peak. It's much better than putting them on every building in the city." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ketura Sun is [...] Israel’s first {{commercial}} <b>solar</b> <b>field.</b> Built in early 2011 by the Arava Power Company on Kibbutz Ketura, Ketura Sun covers twenty acres {{and is expected}} to produce green energy amounting to 4.95 megawatts. The field consists of 18,500 photovoltaic panels made by Suntech, which will produce about 9 gigawatt-hours of electricity per year. In the next twenty years, the field will spare the production of some 125,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide. The field was inaugurated on June 15, 2011.|$|E
2500|$|The Andasol 1 {{solar power}} station is Europe’s first {{parabolic}} trough commercial power plant (50 MWe), located near Guadix {{in the province of}} Granada, also in Andalusia (the plant is named after the region). [...] The Andasol 1 power plant went online in November 2008, and has a thermal storage system which absorbs part of the heat produced in the <b>solar</b> <b>field</b> during the day. This heat is then stored in a molten salt mixture and used to generate electricity during the night, or when the sky is overcast.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, all {{stakes in}} the CdTe PV {{manufacturer}} Calyxo GmbH were sold to Calyxo USA Inc (formerly known as <b>Solar</b> <b>Fields</b> LLC), a U.S company based in Perrysburg, Ohio.|$|R

40|$|The {{assurance}} of perpetual perpendicular insolation of solar collector absorber surface {{may increase the}} insolation energy byca 42 - 45 % [...] A consequence of theincrease in the energy production may be {{the reduction of the}} solar collectors’ surface area. For the large scale <b>solar</b> collector <b>field</b> conception is advantageous to build collector sections with several collectors in one heliostat. For the conception of the <b>solar</b> collector <b>field</b> with heliostat collectors is important to make a regular identification of space parameters of all parts of the <b>solar</b> system <b>field.</b> The placement of the heliostats is a basic condition for the optimal insolation conditions of heliostat <b>solar</b> collectors’ <b>field...</b>|$|R
2500|$|The SEGS is a {{collection}} of nine plants with a total capacity of 354MW and has been the world's largest solar power plant, both thermal and non-thermal, for many years. A newer plant is Nevada Solar One plant with a capacity of 64MW. The 150 MW Andasol solar power stations are in Spain with each site having a capacity of 50MW. Note however, that those plants have heat storage which requires a larger field of solar collectors relative {{to the size of the}} steam turbine-generator to store heat and send heat to the steam turbine at the same time. [...] Heat storage enables better utilization of the steam turbine. [...] With day and some nighttime operation of the steam-turbine Andasol 1 at 50MW peak capacity produces more energy than Nevada Solar One at 64MW peak capacity, due to the former plant's thermal energy storage system and larger <b>solar</b> <b>field.</b> The 280MW Solana Generating Station came online in Arizona in 2013 with 6 hours of power storage. Hassi R'Mel integrated solar combined cycle power station in Algeria and Martin Next Generation Solar Energy Center both use parabolic troughs in a combined cycle with natural gas.|$|E
