5|$|To {{provide the}} desired performance, several {{features}} {{were used in}} the RB.199. To operate efficiently across a wide range of conditions and speeds up to Mach 2, the RB.199 and several other engines make use of variable intake ramps to control the air flow. The hydraulic system is pressurised by <b>syphoning</b> power from both or either operational engine; the hydraulics are completely contained within the airframe rather than integrating with the engine to improve safety and maintainability. In case of double-engine, or double-generator, failure, the Tornado has a single-use battery capable of operating the fuel pump and hydraulics for up to 13 minutes.|$|E

2500|$|Seven cruiser tanks {{from the}} 2nd RTR arrived {{north of the}} hussars and {{destroyed}} the anti-aircraft battery from Benina airfield {{by the light of}} burning vehicles. As dark fell the attacks were stopped despite the Italian disarray, because the 4th Armoured Brigade had been reduced to <b>syphoning</b> the petrol from artillery vehicles and looting Italian supplies to keep going. A better organised and supported Italian breakthrough attempt had to be anticipated for the morning and the tanks disengaged and moved about [...] east of the road to refuel and rearm. Italian vehicle movements around Ghemines and air reconnaissance reports showed that the Italians had achieved a measure of co-ordination and that reinforcements were arriving from the north. Two tanks were seen in the gloom but the crews surrendered to a British soldier, when he knocked on their hatches. Further south, a Rifle Brigade patrol escorting two RHA anti-tank guns moved along the column, firing from different points to give the impression of a larger force and to keep the Italians pinned down, as Combeforce dug in deeper and sowed more mines.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper was to check the design of the <b>syphon</b> which will be {{constructed}} on branch 3 & 4 of El-Sheikh Zayed Canal and will pass under Toshka Spillway Canal. The study included the different scenarios for the <b>syphon</b> operation and calculation of Head Loss at each scenario and its effect on the efficiency of the <b>syphon</b> performance. At each scenario, the separation zones and the vortex formation at all conditions, which may affect on the <b>syphon</b> stability and performance, were observed. The expected sedimentation rates inside the <b>syphon,</b> determination of its removing procedures, the velocities measurements inside the <b>syphon</b> and its effect on the <b>syphon</b> inlet and outlet were also studied in the paper. For this purpose, a physical model for the Sheikh Zayed canal and the <b>syphon</b> body was constructed with scale 1 : 27. The model test program included all scenarios of tunnels operations. These scenarios were tested {{in order to determine the}} best inflow and outflow conditions (flow pattern and separation zones), when one, two, three or four tunnels in operation.

50|$|Due to its popularity, Sony {{commissioned}} 989 Studios to make various sequels and spin-offs to the game. <b>Syphon</b> Filter 2 {{was released}} in 2000 to popular reviews from critics, and another direct sequel, <b>Syphon</b> Filter 3 {{was released in}} 2001 to mixed reviews upon release. Two spin-offs were released for the PlayStation Portable in 2006 and 2007; <b>Syphon</b> Filter: Dark Mirror and <b>Syphon</b> Filter: Logan's Shadow, respectively. A port to the PlayStation 2 for Logan's Shadow was released exclusively in North America in 2010.

50|$|The {{development}} of <b>Syphon</b> Filter {{was difficult for}} Eidetic {{because they had no}} experience making a stealth action game.

50|$|In 1978 it {{was decided}} that the line could be {{extended}} to Scampia and Piscinola, and the funding was provided by the European Community.

It was then advised that plans would have to be adapted to deal with possible future earthquakes. The European Union funded 33% of the total expenditure for this additions to the plans. However, in the mid 1990s it emerged that elements of the Camorra had been involved in <b>syphoning</b> millions of lire of this funding.|$|E

50|$|The {{recently}} established Gowy Meadows Nature Reserve, {{stretching from}} the A5117 to the M56, {{is an area of}} river valley peat covered with wet grassland or grazing meadows. This area of 160 ha, owned by Shell UK, has been created as a nature reserve by Cheshire Wildlife Trust. Surveys by the Environment Agency show that the Gowy's eel population has held up well despite a Europe-wide massive decline in numbers. The reasons for this are unclear but local anglers suggest that eel in the river may not follow normal migration patterns because of the partially closed nature of the river flow caused by the system of <b>syphoning</b> under the ship canal.|$|E

[...] Graham pointed out that Draganović, in running his 'ratline,' was not {{acting on behalf of}} the Vatican: [...] "Just because he's a priest doesn't mean he represents the Vatican. It was his own operation." [...] At the same time, there were four occasions in which the Vatican did intervene on behalf of interned Ustasha prisoners. The Secretariat of State asked the UK and US governments to release Croatian POWs from British internment camps in Italy.|$|E
50|$|Nozzle Based Technologies : In this system, the {{fuelling}} nozzle has a reader mounted on it which, when {{inserted into the}} vehicles filler neck, reads the vehicles ID using near field or RFID technology. Once plagued by the breakage of wires running down the outside or inside of the hose from the reader to the FM Terminal, the latest generation use a radio link to pass the data making their use in a commercial environment a viable option. The advantage {{of this type of}} system is that the {{fuelling nozzle}} must be fully inserted into the vehicle before fuel starts to flow, and fuelling stops if the nozzle is removed, making on-site fuel theft into containers much more difficult. Unfortunately, it does nothing to stop off-site fuel theft and so should be coupled with anti <b>syphoning</b> technologies to complete the system.|$|E
