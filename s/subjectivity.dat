5|$|Weber was {{concerned}} {{with the question of}} objectivity and <b>subjectivity.</b> Weber distinguished social action from social behavior, noting that social action must be understood through how individuals subjectively relate to one another. Study of social action through interpretive means (Verstehen) must be based upon understanding the subjective meaning and purpose that individuals attach to their actions. Social actions may have easily identifiable and objective means, but much more subjective ends and the understanding of those ends by a scientist is subject to yet another layer of subjective understanding (that of the scientist). Weber noted that the importance of <b>subjectivity</b> in social sciences makes creation of fool-proof, universal laws much more difficult than in natural sciences and that the amount of objective knowledge that social sciences may achieve is precariously limited. Overall, Weber supported the goal of objective science, but he noted that it is an unreachable goal– although one definitely worth striving for.|$|E

The paper reviews the developing students’ <b>subjectivities,</b> focusing on students’ abilities and personal characteristics, such as students’ setting goals, achievement values, recognizing actual or potential perspectives. The article aims to study the problem of developing students’ <b>subjectivities</b> and to carry out theoretical analysis of students’ <b>subjectivities</b> showing {{the historical development of}} this category and reflecting the stages of students’ professional and pedagogical development. The target group of students are students related to pedagogical teaching practice.

We also focus on stages of students’ professional and pedagogical development, such as the stage of students’ professional training, professional adaptation stage and directly professionalization. In this regard, we present the core conceptual bases of students’ <b>subjectivities</b> development to professional and pedagogical performance. The conceptual bases highlight the idea of ​​students’ gradual change from one stage of students’ professional and pedagogical development to the following ones; the idea of the organization of reflective teaching activities of students’ interaction in the development of students’ subjectivities; and the idea of ​​interpreting the mechanisms of the students’ <b>subjectivities</b> development...|$|R

5|$|As an example, the {{execution}} scene in The Kingdom of This World puts European and autochthonous cultures in opposition {{through the use}} of the spectator-performer relationship. In this spectacle situation, Carpentier is able to juxtapose the Europeans' experience of Macandal's body falling into the flames with the autochthonous (Afro-Haitian) experience of Macandal's body flying off the stake. Through the different, mutable views of the performance that he creates, Carpentier is able to represent an unstable cultural identity. As a second example, the scene that Ti Noel constructs around himself after the sacking of the Sans-Souci Palace presents the reader with a dramatic rehearsal in which Ti Noel represents culturally mobile <b>subjectivity</b> by performing different identities on his own.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} <b>subjectivity</b> and {{objectivity}} {{can be divided}} into a concern over the general possibilities of social actions, and, on the other hand the specific problem of social scientific knowledge. In the former, the subjective is often equated (though not necessarily) with the individual, and the individual's intentions and interpretations of the objective. The objective is often considered any public or external action or outcome, on up to society writ large. A primary question for social theorists is how knowledge reproduces along the chain of subjective-objective-subjective, that is to say: how is intersubjectivity achieved? While, historically, qualitative methods have attempted to tease out subjective interpretations, quantitative survey methods also attempt to capture individual subjectivities. Also, some qualitative methods take a radical approach to objective description in situ.|$|E

40|$|In {{line with}} the shift towards prioritising lay {{accounts}} and narratives of chronic illness in critical health research, there is an emerging literature on men, <b>subjectivities</b> and experiences of distress. We argue in this paper that <b>subjectivities</b> and distress for men are an important area for critical research and scholarship. In the area of health, very {{little is known about}} men’s <b>subjectivities</b> or the meanings they give to – and how they cope with or seek help for – distress. At the same time, current theories of gender relations, performativity and wellbeing as they pertain to men are likely influence future work. However, current theories (and qualitative research involving men and women) are pointing to considerable complexity. In this paper, we outline what is known about distress and men, and consider the utility of gender relations, performativity, <b>subjectivities</b> and wellbeing for a better understanding of distress. We scan the horizon and ask: What are the biopsychosocial influences on <b>subjectivities</b> and distress, and how should these be considered in relation to men and masculinities? What are the implications for theorising about men, as well as mental health research...|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} {{a review of}} the academic literature on the night-time economy (NTE) of British cities. The first half of the article concentrates {{on the development of the}} contemporary NTE by academics in the 1990 s, showing how such ideas were translated to policy makers through their concomitance with other policies such as urban entrepreneurialism and market liberalization which fitted into neoliberal policy trends. The second half of the article discusses the subsequent academic critique of NTE. Although this has focused on the regulatory practices of neoliberalism, showing how these have lead to large concentrations of bars which promote unhealthy drinking practices, there has been a move in recent work to also consider the <b>subjectivities</b> which have developed in the neoliberal NTE. I suggest that an understanding of <b>subjectivities</b> informed by theoretical work of Deleuze and Guattari and non-representational theories, which see <b>subjectivities</b> as trans-personal assemblages which emerge through dispersed interactions between bodies and affects, can develop these insights. This moves research into neoliberal <b>subjectivities</b> in the NTE towards a research agenda in which the processes of the emergence of <b>subjectivities</b> are investigated and which thus responds to some of the recent critiques made of regulatory-focused approaches...|$|R
40|$|Scientific {{assessments}} of socio-ecological systems are becoming mainstays in guiding policymaking and other interventions {{in response to}} global environmental change. The environmentality literature emphasizes the institutional architecture of emergent science-policy regimes and how scientific research is used in political settings, creating new modes of governance and <b>subjectivities.</b> However, there has been relatively little attention to domain-level socio-ecological assessments as socially produced technologies where specific scientific choices are mechanisms connecting governance architecture and popular <b>subjectivities.</b> Combining empirical case study and literature review, assessment technologies are analyzed in three domains: vulnerability assessment, ecosystem services assessment, life-cycle assessment. Using conceptualization, operationalization, and institutionalization as analytical lenses, the cases illustrate ways that scientific choices simplify complex socio-ecological relationships with implications for both governance practices and <b>subjectivities.</b> Furthermore, findings explore the possibility for assessments to be more inclusive of diverse social values and practices, enabling more empowering <b>subjectivities.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} <b>subjectivities</b> of females {{practicing}} same-sex sexuality in Mexico City. These <b>subjectivities</b> are here viewed {{in relationship to}} recent economic transformations in Mexico and to ideas on gender and sexuality produced by diverse actors such as {{the gay and lesbian}} and feminist movements, government programs, the media, and the Catholic Church. While the individual subject is constructed through different dominant ideas, female same-sex sexuality in Mexico, offers an interesting case because most dominant ideas suggest that it cannot exist. Analyzing dominant ideas is, then, not sufficient to understand how <b>subjectivities</b> are constructed. Hegemonic ideas are pieced together to form <b>subjectivities,</b> but meanings on gender and sexuality are also produced by subjects that are here viewed as possessing a creative potential. Subversive ideas are not only considered reactive responses to hegemonic ideals but rather as an active shaping of life to make the everyday experience possible. The presentation of <b>subjectivities</b> here focuses on three main themes: Gender and sexual self-representation; love and sexuality; and, life with the family. The second part of the thesis presents three testimonies that have the potential of challenging fixed definitions of these women's identities and realities. This thesis contributes to the understanding of gender and sexuality in Mexico City from the unexplored location of female same-sex sexuality, and {{to the understanding of the}} effects on sexualities and <b>subjectivities</b> of the social and economic changes that have taken place in Mexico during the past decades...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{empirical}} research in Nagaon, India, this study offers a post-colonial feminist analysis of <b>subjectivities</b> available to Muslim girls in contemporary Assam {{and the ways}} in which these girls inhabit and negotiate these <b>subjectivities.</b> To understand the <b>subjectivities</b> made available to Muslim girls, I first investigate how government policies for education authorize certain types of subjective possibilities for Muslim girls. I then analyze the narratives of teachers and parents to understand how gender, class, ethnicity and religion intersect in different ways to confer certain <b>subjectivities</b> as well as to challenge and reinforce the conferred <b>subjectivities.</b> Finally, I discuss Muslim girls’ reconstructions of self through a combination of resistance and conformity to the conferred <b>subjectivities.</b> The study begins by locating this research in the context of the wider sociological literature highlighting Muslim women’s overall invisibility, key gaps in understandings of contemporary Muslim girlhoods and the limitation of the liberal feminist conception of agency as resistance. Methodologically, the study combines an analysis of educational equality policies, data from interviews with Muslim girls, their teachers, and parents, and focus group discussions across five different types of schools in Nagaon. The conceptual framework has been drawn from the scholarships of Nancy Fraser’s perspectival dualism and Pierre Bourdieu’s cultural authorization, as appropriated by feminist scholars. Fraser’s perspectival dualism approach and the distinction between affirmative and transformative justice provide tools to understand various types of injustices at different levels (inter and intragroup) in the lives of school going Muslim girls. Feminist appropriations of Bourdieu help to think through discourses about class, gender, religion and ethnicity through which <b>subjectivities</b> are conferred upon Muslim girls. The Muslim girls’ responses to these conferred <b>subjectivities</b> are understood using the concepts of reflexivity, and agency conceptualized as resilience. The thesis concludes that the equal opportunity policy framework constitutes and normalizes the <b>subjectivities</b> of Muslim girls as economically subordinate and as culturally different. These abstract policy pronouncements are made real in the schools through teachers’ perception of deficit in culture, morality, merit, and language. Muslim parents challenge the teachers’ and policy perspectives through their investment in the idea of good girlhood that serves as a marker for ‘good families’, symbolically authorizing them as middle-class. Muslim girls resist and conform to the <b>subjectivities</b> conferred in the policies, by teachers and parents using their reflexive abilities. Mostly these negotiations are based on ad-hoc individual gains, rather than a transformative, collective feminist politics. They enable these girls to disrupt and negotiate the narratives ‘about’ them. Overall this thesis offers an alternative to identitarian politics or cultural explanations of Muslim women’s educational ‘backwardness’ in India, by applying insights from Fraser and Bourdieu to Muslim women’s intersectional educational disadvantage. The thesis also directs focus upon Muslim girls’ agency as encompassing their ‘reflexive’ articulation of suffering, conformity, and resistance to the <b>subjectivities</b> conferred upon them. This study offers an original contribution to the study of gendered minorities, institutions and relationships in the post-colonial contexts...|$|R
40|$|My paper {{investigates the}} {{possible}} connections among affect, design and late-capitalism strategies of commodification of experience. Drawing from a Spinozistic-Deleuzian concept of affect I intend to map how the current production of <b>subjectivities</b> is profoundly entangled with capitalist strategies {{of management and}} control of the affective sphere. As Deleuze wrote in his prescient Post-Script on the Societies of Control, contemporary capitalism operates by mining and modulating the pathosphere. Value is now extracted from life; a new distribution of the sensible shapes consumption; affects are being co-opted by what I call semio-chemio-affective-neuro capital. The contemporary pathosphere is being designed by interventions that simultaneously indicate capitalism’s capacities for reinvention, as well as the relentless expansion of the signature of the commodity. Specifically, the encounter with designed commodities needs to be probed to address the way in which <b>subjectivities</b> are being produced by, and emerge from, the designing of experience itself as a commodity. What types of <b>subjectivities</b> are required by the current formation of capitalism? Can it be argued that these new affect-literate <b>subjectivities</b> emerge from their relations with designed commodities? How can this encounter with the commodity be reconfigured to account for contagious affective competencies? Are <b>subjectivities</b> increasingly designed and commodified too...|$|R
