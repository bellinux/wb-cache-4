50|$|The pile of {{the carpet}} is shorn with special knives (or {{carefully}} burned down) {{in order to}} remove excess pile and obtain an equal surface. In parts of Central Asia, a small sickle-shaped knife with the outside edge sharpened is used for pile <b>shearing.</b> <b>Knives</b> of this shape have been excavated from Bronze Age sites in Turkmenistan (cited in). In some carpets, a relief effect is obtained by clipping the pile unevenly following {{the contours of the}} design. This feature is often seen in Chinese and Tibetan rugs.|$|R
50|$|DIN 1.2344 {{is widely}} used in various places in both cold and hot working. In hot work {{processing}} DIN 1.2344 <b>shear</b> <b>knives</b> and dummy block extrusion can be used. In cold work process this steel is used for punching, heading and inserting of die blocks.DIN 1.2344 is a high hot-wear resistance and great strength, warm conductivity air hardening and invulnerability to hot cracking.

50|$|The {{discovery}} of copper and bronze manufacture {{had a significant}} impact on the history of the Old World. Metals were hard enough to make weapons that were heavier, stronger, and more resistant to impact-related damage than their wood, bone, or stone equivalents. For several millennia, bronze was the material of choice for weapons such as swords, daggers, battle axes, and spear and arrow points, as well as protective gear such as shields, helmets, greaves (metal shin guards), and other body armor. Bronze also supplanted stone, wood, and organic materials in all sorts of tools and household utensils, such as chisels, saws, adzes, nails, blade <b>shears,</b> <b>knives,</b> sewing needles and pins, jugs, cooking pots and cauldrons, mirrors, horse harnesses, and much more. Tin and copper also contributed to the establishment of trade networks spanning large areas of Europe and Asia, and had a major effect on the distribution of wealth among individuals and nations.|$|R
60|$|Oat sheaves ridging the {{bleached}} prairie blazed {{in yellow}} ranks before my heavy eyes, and each heave of the binder's arms flung out behind me a truss of golden wheat. The glare was blinding, for we worked under the full {{heat of a}} scorching afternoon, as we had done, and would do, by the pale light of the moon. Thick dust rolled about us, clogging my lashes and fouling the coats of the beasts, while the crackle of the flinty stems, the rasp of <b>shearing</b> <b>knives,</b> the rhythm of trampling hoofs, and the clink of metal throbbing harmoniously through the drowsy heat, were flung back by other machines at work across the grain. There is, however, a limit to human powers, and I must have been driving mechanically, and nearly asleep, when a clicking warned {{me that it was}} time to fit another spool of twine. I remember that during the operation I envied the endurance of the soulless, but otherwise almost human, machine.|$|R

40|$|Mechanical {{cutting of}} {{visco-elastic}} polymers is experimentally investigated using sharp knives. The knife is aligned orthogonally to the substrate’s surface, and is {{forced into the}} substrate. Two cutting scenarios are investigated i) plunge cutting, where the knife edge moves directly into the substrate, and ii) slicing, where the <b>knife</b> <b>shears</b> tangentially as it moves into the substrate. For slicing fracture lines emanating from the cut are observed, and the threshold forces for cutting are considerably smaller, indicating that the two cutting processes are very different. ...|$|R
50|$|During {{the eighteenth}} century, agents for the Sheffield cutlery {{industry}} scoured the British country-side, offering new carriage springs for old. Springs {{must be made}} of hardened steel. At this time, the processes for making steel produced an extremely variable product—quality was not ensured at the initial point of sale. Springs that had survived cracking through hard use over the rough roads of the time, had proven to be of a better quality steel. Much of the fame of Sheffield cutlery (<b>knives,</b> <b>shears,</b> etc.) {{was due to the}} extreme lengths the companies took to ensure they used high-grade steel.|$|R
40|$|Tensile {{experiments}} on cold-drawn Ni microwires with diameters from similar to 115 to 50 gm revealed high strengths, with significant strength variability for finer wires with diameters less than similar to 50 gm. The wires showed pronounced necking at fracture. The coarser wires with diameters > 50 mu m exhibited conventional ductile cup-cone fracture, with dimples {{in the central}} zone and peripheral shear lips, whereas finer wires failed by <b>shear</b> with <b>knife</b> or chisel-edge fractures. Shear bands were observed in all samples. Further, through- section microscopy of selected fractured samples revealed that the shear bands did not go across the enitre specimen for the coarser wires. The shear bands led to grain fragmention, with a reduction in grain aspect ratio as well as rotations away from the initial orientations. The strength data were analysed based on a Weibull approach. The data could be rationalized in terms of failure from volume defects in coarser wires, with a high Weibull modulus, and from surface defects in finer wires, with a low Weibull modulus and greater variability.

40|$|Aims: To compare several {{different}} instruments used {{to open the}} chest wall during necropsy and to assess whether any one type reduced the production of sharp rib ends and thus the potential for receiving an injury. Methods: During the necropsy the pathologist opened the chest wall using two randomly assigned instruments from a selection of hand saw, electric saw, rib <b>shears,</b> and bread <b>knife.</b> The age, weight, sex, and height of the deceased were recorded, {{in addition to the}} textures of the resultant exposed rib ends. During the procedure, the speed, length, production of spray, and site of incision were also noted. The thoracic cavity was inspected and any details of tumours, adhesions, fluid, or organ damage were noted. Results: Twenty four necropsies were carried out on a...|$|R
50|$|Burgon & Ball {{is an old}} Sheffield firm which {{originally}} made <b>shears,</b> {{scissors and}} <b>knives.</b> Its Sheffield origins date back to 1730; they moved to the La Plata Works on Holme Lane in Malin Bridge in 1873. The works were built {{on the site of}} a cutlery grinding wheel, which had existed since the 1690s, on land cleared after the 1864 flood. The works stand {{on the banks of the}} River Loxley and the river provided much of the power for the works throughout the 1900s. In the latter part of the 19th century the company patented a design for hand sheep shears and in one year sold over 300,000 pairs of shears. By 1920 the firm was producing more garden shears than sheep shears and it has continued to diversify into garden tools over the years. There is still a market for hand sheep shears and the company is now the only British manufacturer.|$|R
40|$|As {{dehorning}} or {{removal of}} horn in cattle is rather a cruel but necessary operation, it is advisable {{to prevent the}} horns from growing in young calves rather than removing them after they have grown. However, in certain cases dehorning is required {{to be done in}} adult cattle due to fracture of the horn or horn cancer etc. In adult cattle, dehorning is best performed by a veterinary surgeon. Physical methods of dehorning include the use of embryotomy wire, guillotine <b>shears,</b> or dehorning <b>knives,</b> saws, or high tension rubber bands. The incorrect use of these instruments/tools can cause serious damage and even lead to fatalities. When cattle have large horns they are sometimes "tipped", a procedure that removes the sharp end of the horn but leaves the base. Dehorning of adult cattle is associated with increased risks of sinusitis, bleeding, prolonged wound healing and infection. Therefore, proper care must be taken to prevent these problems as per advice of a vet. To prevent maggot formation apply dressing oil containing linseed oil (100 ml), turpentine oil (10 ml) & eycalpytus oil (10 ml) twice daily Text Message: Dehornig is best done in young calf. To dehorn adult animal, help of vet is required. There is chance of bleeding and infection. Apply dressing oil to prevent fly. Reference...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of a new machine is described, from an idea conceived in 1960 to a prototype operative in September 1964. The {{emphasis is on the}} decisions, methods, criteria, and results incorporated in the machine rather than on analytical aspects of the design. The primary criterion guiding the design was to provide a machine more economical for users to own. A description is given of the machine, PC 64, which is a new completely hydraulic 42 in. x 4 in. capacity production paper cutter of the guillotine type, weighing less than 3000 lbs. Introduction of the essentials of a guillotine cutter and analysis of a 1960 commercial machine are used to establish reference limits for the new machine. Results of cutting tests performed to determine the most advantageous cutting angle are included. Important new features of PC 64 include a single <b>shear</b> straightline motion <b>knife</b> drive powered by a single hydraulic cylinder, and a hydraulically driven and controlled backstop. Optional automatic control for the backstop is accomplished by means of notched program bars affording trimout cuts to. 015 in. It is shown that for any cutting angle selected, the height, width, and length of PC 64 cannot be reduced further. The machine is evaluated by comparison with commercial cutters marketed prior to and during the project. From the comparison it is concluded that features of PC 64 have commercial potential and that the primary criterion has been met.
