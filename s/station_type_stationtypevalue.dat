40|$|AbstractThe {{paper has}} two major parts. The first part deals with two-station {{networks}} with blocking-after-service (BAS) mechanism and different <b>station</b> <b>types.</b> In this part only single class of jobs is allowed. The contribution {{here is to}} show that exact solutions exist for two-station queueing networks with BAS mechanism having different <b>station</b> <b>types.</b> The exact equilibrium state probability distributions are derived. Insensitivity is investigated and formulas for performance measures are obtained. It is demonstrated that the throughput, mean number of jobs and mean number of Cblocked jobs depend on the scheduling discipline. A queueing network model with more than two stations is analyzed in the second part. Multiple-job classes with job class change, and different <b>station</b> <b>types</b> are allowed in the model. Exact solutions for equilibrium state probabilities and performance measures are obtained under the condition that only a certain total number of jobs is allowed in the network...|$|R

40|$|Interest in {{hydrogen}} as {{a transportation}} fuel {{is growing in}} Shanghai. Shell Hydrogen, Tongji University, and the City of Shanghai plan to construct a network of refueling stations throughout the city to stimulate fuel cell vehicle and bus deployment. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to (1) examine the near-term costs of building hydrogen <b>stations</b> of various <b>types</b> and sizes in Shanghai and (2) present a flexible cost analysis methodology that can be applied to other metropolitan regions. The costs for four different <b>station</b> <b>types</b> are analyzed with respect to size and hydrogen production method. These costs are compared with cost estimates of similar stations built in California. Based on the hydrogen station cost analysis conducted here, we have found that hydrogen costs ($/kg) vary considerably based on <b>station</b> <b>type</b> and size. On-site hydrogen production from methane or methanol results in the lowest cost per kg. The higher cost of truck-delivered hydrogen from industrial sites in Shanghai vs. California is mainly due to feedstock costs differences. Electrolyzer stations yield the highest hydrogen cost.

30|$|Table 4 and Fig. 3 {{show that}} Scenario 1 {{surprisingly}} slightly reduces {{the number of}} train passengers in Rotterdam CS and The Hague CS (<b>stations</b> <b>type</b> 1) due to distributional effects in the routes of PT-users; <b>stations</b> nearby (<b>type</b> 2 / 3) become more attractive and attract passengers from the central stations. Scenario 1 upgrades the assessment of quality infrastructure to 8 in all stations, making smaller stations more attractive, while the bigger stations remain with the same quality level. The increase {{in the frequency of}} local trains in the corridor Leiden-Dordrecht (Scenario 6) has the strongest percent effect on the number of train use at <b>station</b> <b>type</b> 5, which currently have the lowest train level-of-service (Table 4). The intercity railway stations Hague CS and Rotterdam CS (NS <b>type</b> 1 <b>stations)</b> hardly benefit as increase of the frequency of local trains represents a marginal change in the already high level of service. Four of the five bicycle-train integration policy scenarios are more powerful in producing ridership increases than the scenario with increased sprinter frequencies. However, {{it should be noted that}} the bicycle-train policy measures affect more train stations; these are assumed to be implemented at 35 – 38 train stations in the case study area and the frequency increase affects 19 stations in the corridor.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Transportation Research Record, and the definitive published version is available at [URL] paper aims to highlight the impact of train and <b>station</b> <b>types</b> {{in the evaluation of}} service quality, whilst taking account of a range of relevant trip and socio-demographic factors. It applies a partial constrained proportional odds model (an extension of ordered logit model) to data extracted from the 32 nd wave of the National Rail Passenger Survey (NRPS) held in spring 2015, which comprises around 30, 000 trip-level observations of passenger satisfaction of rail services across Great Britain. The results indicate that the impact of train types on service quality is significant. Thus, for type of train services the modelling results indicate that high speed rail, long distance, inter urban rail and especially open access operators are more likely to lead to satisfied customers compared to commuter and rural railway services. For stations, users of the smallest station category {{are more likely to be}} satisfied than those of larger category stations, but other <b>station</b> <b>types</b> do not significantly impact satisfaction. Next, delays have a significant negative impact on satisfaction levels. Considering passenger segments, respondents in the oldest age category are more likely to be satisfied compared to respondents in the youngest age category and commuters are less likely to be satisfied compared to respondents on a business or leisure trip. Overall these results show how TOCs (Train Operating Companies) might best focus their efforts on improving passenger satisfaction according to train <b>type,</b> <b>station</b> <b>type,</b> and trip stage and/or user segment...|$|R

40|$|The {{measures}} {{of local and}} regional accessibility have been developed separately, resulting on a scarcely studied connection between these two. Accessibility evaluation of land-use and transport strategies can be much improved by linkages with more understandable, and local, accessibility measures for research and policy makers. This paper develops a multimodal model to analyse a set of scenarios of chain mobility, i. e. bicycle route quality, BTM frequency and bicycle parking cost. The results reflect the effects on accessibility levels in a national transport model. A detailed bicycle network is implemented and linked to the public transport network. The effect of access and egress penalties is verified by introducing station specific penalties by mode and <b>station</b> <b>type</b> (mode-station constant). The penalties are derived from time valuations (VOT) and willingness to pay (WTP) for transport improvements. The study area covers 54 stations of the Stedenbaan corridor, within the Randstad south wing. A set of transport scenarios are simulated for both 2012 and 2030. A potential job accessibility measure was calculated with the matrices of travel times generated from each scenario. On average the largest travel time reduction is by 15 % between 2012 and 2030, when a scenario of better network and connectivity takes place. The results also show the increase in train passengers due to improved bicycle access. We identified that transport measures should be station based. The strongest effects occur in medium and small <b>station</b> <b>types,</b> i. e. 3, 4 and 5. Particularly, <b>station</b> <b>types</b> 3 and 4 are more sensitive to changes in bicycle network {{than the rest of}} stations. At the same time, labour force has a strong impact on reaching high job accessibility levels per region and station areas. The job accessibility increased up to 20 %. As future research, the behavioural elements of the national transport models can be enriched to produce more user-oriented results...|$|R
