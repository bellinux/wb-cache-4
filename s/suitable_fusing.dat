To maintain a low failure electrical breakdown or blackout analysis of faults leads to appropriate protection settings which can be computed in order to select <b>suitable</b> <b>fuse,</b> circuit breaker size and type of relay.

50|$|In September 1915, {{following}} a Zeppelin raid on London, Scott was tasked by the First Lord, Arthur Balfour {{to establish the}} London Air Defence Area to defend London from the increasing threat of air attack. Little thought {{had been given to}} the possibility of air attack and anti-air measures had been given no priority. Scott's first priority was to devise a high-explosive shell, easy to manufacture and with a <b>suitable</b> <b>fuse.</b> With the help of the Navy's Anti-Aircraft department this was quickly achieved but then came the problem of getting the proposals through the Admiralty's administrative process into production. To avoid this Scott took the plans to France where he directly commissioned a car manufacturer which started production quickly and efficiently.|$|R
5000|$|The Europlug is {{physically}} not compatible with BS 1363 13 A sockets. The UK wiring regulations permit ring circuits and require a <b>suitable</b> <b>fuse</b> to be fitted in each plug {{to protect the}} appliance cable; Europlugs do not contain such fuses. BS 1363 sockets contain a child-safety shutter; clause 13.7.2 of BS 1363-2 requires that Europlugs will not open the shutters. In some types of BS 1363 socket (but not all) the safety mechanism can be tampered with so that a Europlug may then be forced into the open [...] and neutral ports. The UK Electrical Safety Council has drawn attention to the fire risk associated with forcing Europlugs into BS 1363 sockets. There is also a risk of damage to both the plug and socket. Europlugs are also different from the similar looking BS 4573 (UK Shaver) two-pin plugs.|$|R
40|$|Dempster's Rule is {{commonly}} {{described as an}} operator for fusing beliefs. While there are different possible interpretations of belief fusion, there is considerable confusion regarding the exact type of belief fusion that Dempster's rule performs. Many alternative operators for belief fusion have been proposed, where some {{are based on the}} same fundamental principle as Dempster's rule, and others have a totally different basis, such as the consensus operator. In this article we {{take a closer look at}} Dempster's rule in order to determine exactly what type of belief fusion it performs. Our conclusion is that Dempster's rule in fact represents a method for serial combination of constraints, which is not <b>suitable</b> for <b>fusing</b> different beliefs on the same frame of discernment.

40|$|For {{spectroscopy}} in space, GRISM elements -obtained by patterning gratings on a prism surface-are gaining increasing interest. Originally {{developed as}} dispersive elements for insertion into an imaging light path without deflecting the beam, they are progressively found in sophisticated multi stage dispersion optics. We report on GRISM manufacturing by joining the individual functional elements -prisms and gratings- to <b>suitable</b> components. <b>Fused</b> silica {{was used as}} glass material and the gratings were realized by e-beam lithography und dry etching. Alignment of the grating dispersion direction to the prism angle was realized by passive adjustment. Materials adapted bonds of high transmission, stiffness and strength were obtained at temperatures of about 200 degrees C in vacuum by hydrophilic direct bonding. Examples for bonding uncoated as well as coated fused silica surfaces are given. The results illustrate the great potential of hydrophilic glass direct bonding for manufacturing transmission optics to be used under highly demanding environmental conditions, as typical in space...|$|R

40|$|Synthetic {{variable}} ratio (SVR) {{method was}} first introduced to fuse panchromatic (PAN) image and multispectral (MS) image by Muechika et al in 1993 [1], and was improved by Zhang Y. in 1999 and 2001 respectively [2, 3]. As for Muechika SVR method, it isn't <b>suitable</b> for <b>fusing</b> PAN and MS which cover large area. And for Zhang Y. SVR(ZY-SVR) method, {{on the one hand}} it needs to select a great number of pixels of different land coverage classes to conduct multiple regression analysis and thus it seems greatly empirical; on the other hand the coefficients obtained through regression lack physical meanings. This paper puts forward a new method called LAB-SRV which introduces the sensor spectral response into SVR method using the CIELab color space. Several experiments done in this paper indicate that this method can sharpen multi-spectral MS images without changing their spectral characters very much and have an advantage over ZY-SVR method with PAN and MS of IKONOS and QuickBird. © 2008 IEEE.

Isomeric helical architectures arising from electrophilic cyclisation processes at second reaction sites in the precursors could also be obtained under different acidic conditions.

40|$|Composite acrylonitrile–butadiene–styrene (ABS) /carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNT) filaments at 1, 2, 4, 6 and 8 wt %, <b>suitable</b> for <b>fused</b> deposition modelling (FDM) {{were obtained}} by using a completely solvent-free process based on direct melt compounding and extrusion. The optimal CNT content in the filaments for FDM {{was found to be}} 6 wt %; for this composite, a detailed investigation of the thermal, mechanical and electrical properties was performed. Presence of CNT in ABS filaments and 3 D-printed parts resulted in a significant enhancement of the tensile modulus and strength, accompanied by a reduction of the elongation at break. As documented by dynamic mechanical thermal analysis, the stiffening effect of CNTs in ABS is particularly pronounced at high temperatures. Besides, the presence of CNT in 3 D-printed parts accounts for better creep and thermal dimensional stabilities of 3 D-printed parts, accompanied by a reduction of the coefficient of thermal expansion). 3 D-printed nanocomposite samples with 6 wt % of CNT exhibited a good electrical conductivity, even if lower than pristine composite filaments...|$|R
40|$|A {{microfabricated}} high-throughput cell electrofusion chip with 1, 368 {{pairs of}} high aspect ratio silicon microelectrodes is presented. These microelectrodes, which were distributed in six individual microscale cell-fusion chambers, {{were covered with}} titanium and gold thin film to improve their electric conductivity as well as surface hydrophobility. Six chambers having different electrode distances make the chip highly <b>suitable</b> for <b>fusing</b> cells with different sizes. A microfluidic platform was set up for flowing control, cell manipulation and also experimental observation. Cells for electrofusion were first aligned at the prearranged locations by the dielectrophoretic force between two counter-electrodes, which benefits the traverse of electric pulse through the cell-cell contacting point for electroporation. Several on-chip cell electrofusion experiments {{have been carried out}} on different kinds of animal cells and plant protoplasts. Compared with conventional electrofusion methods, higher fusion efficiency was achieved on this device for precisely forming micropores on the proximate membranes of two contacting cells, and high throughput was also obtained due to the use {{of a large number of}} microelectrodes for cell manipulation and fusion. Moreover, a much lower power supply was required for the shorter distance between two counter-electrodes. Department of Health Technology and Informatic...|$|R

40|$|The {{double salt}} calcium uranium(IV) {{fluoride}} can be precipitated from uranyl nitrate solution. In {{the presence of}} fluoride and calcium ions, ferrous salts will reduce uranium(VI) nitrate to the four state precipitating calcium uranium(IV) fluoride. X-ray studies showed that the compound is a true double salt. The salt can be dehydrated under argon at 250 deg C and reduced to metal by the bomb technique. Reduction yields are high, but co-precipitated iron in the salt is concentrated in the uranium button, resulting in iron impurities of approximately 0. 6 %. The double salt is a <b>suitable</b> feed for <b>fused</b> salt electrolysis. Electrolyzing from a solution of 30 % double salt dissolved in LiC 1 - KC 1 eutectic dendritic uranium was recovered with a current efficiency of 35 %.

However, {{it is not always}} easy to find the desired information and in clinical routine the time to fulfil an information need is often very limited. Information retrieval systems are a useful tool to provide access to these documents/images in the biomedical literature related to information needs of medical professionals. Shangri–La is a medical retrieval system that can potentially help clinicians to make decisions on difficult cases. It retrieves articles from the biomedical literature when querying a case description and attached images. The system is based on a multimodal retrieval approach with a focus on the integration of visual information connected to text. The approach includes a query–adaptive multimodal fusion criterion that analyses if visual features are <b>suitable</b> to be <b>fused</b> with text for the retrieval. Furthermore, image modality information is integrated in the retrieval step. The approach is evaluated using the ImageCLEFmed 2013 medical retrieval benchmark and can thus be compared to other approaches.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Electrical EngineeringWilliam KuhnWhen enough charges {{accumulate}} on two objects, the air dielectric {{between them}} breaks down {{to create a}} phenomenon known as electrostatic discharge (ESD). ESD is of great concern in the integrated circuit industry because of the damage it can cause to ICs. The problem will only become worse as process components become smaller. The three main types of ESD experienced by an IC are the human body model (HBM), the charged device model (CDM), and the machine model (MM). HBM ESD has the highest voltage while CDM ESD has the highest bandwidth and current of the three ESD types. Integrated circuits generally include ESD protection circuitry connected to their pads. Pads are {{the connection between the}} IC and the outside world, making them the required location for circuitry designed to route ESD events away from the IC's internal circuitry. The most basic protection pads use diodes connected from I/O to VDD and I/O to ground. A voltage clamp between VDD and ground is also necessary to protect against CDM and MM event types where the device may not yet have a low impedance supply path connected. The purpose of this research is to investigate the performance of ESD circuits and to develop a method for detecting the occurrence of an ESD event in an integrated circuit by utilizing IC fuses. The combination of IC fuses and detection circuitry designed to sense a broken fuse allows the IC to perform a built-in self-test (BIST) for ESD to identify compromised ICs, preventing manufacturers from shipping damaged circuits. Simulations are used to design an optimized protection circuit to complement the proposed ESD detection circuit. Optimization of an ESD pad circuit increases the turn-on speed of its voltage clamps and decreases the series resistance of its protection diodes. These improvements minimize the stress voltage placed on internal circuitry due to an ESD event. An ESD measurement setup is established and used to verify voltage clamp operation. This research also proposes an ESD detection circuit based on IC fuses, which fail during an ESD event. A variety of IC fuses are tested using the ESD measurement setup as well as a TLP setup {{in order to determine the}} time and current needed for them to break. <b>Suitable</b> IC <b>fuses</b> have a resistance less than 5 Ω and consistently break during the first trial...|$|R
