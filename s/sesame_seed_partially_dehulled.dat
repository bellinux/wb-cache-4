2500|$|Exports from Ethiopia to China {{have grown}} from {{negligible}} levels before 2000 to around US$130 million in 2006, primarily in raw {{materials such as}} <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds</b> and <b>partially</b> finished leather. [...] Meanwhile, exports from China to Ethiopia have grown from under US$50 million in 1996 to US$430 million in 2006, including low-priced clothing, machinery and electronics equipment. The Ethiopian government has encouraged imports, purchasing Chinese equipment and supplying it to local construction and manufacturing firms on a lease-to-buy basis. Trade continues to grow rapidly. By 2015 bilateral trade had grown to $3.8 billion, with Ethiopian exports encouraged through special quota and tariff arrangements on many goods. In a paper prepared for the OECD, economist Tegegne Gebre Egziabher of Addis Ababa University notes that in the short term, cheap Chinese imports may have damaged local producers. However, the longer term benefit may be to stimulate improvements in efficiency and quality. Chinese investment in local infrastructure may assist towards this outcome.|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} find a simple {{assessment}} method for <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds,</b> we investigated the relation among the taste components and taste and shape scores of 20 types of <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds.</b> Free sugars and free amino acids were determined by HPLC and total sugars using a spectrophotometer. Sensory evaluations were carried out to examine the quality of <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds</b> roasted under the same conditions. The shape scores of these <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds</b> were calculated to measure their weight and size. A positive correlation was observed between all sugar contents and the contents of total free sugars or free amino acids. In white <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds,</b> a particularly high correlation was observed between the contents of total free amino acids and fructose or glucose. Further, a sensory evaluation showed that the taste of <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds</b> differed according to their color; hence, we analyzed this data for each color. A positive correlation was observed between the overall evaluation scores and umami amino acids contents of black <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds,</b> {{as well as between}} the sweetness scores and all sugar contents of white <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds.</b> Positive correlations were found between the 100 -grain weight, circumferential length, and long- or short-grain diameter of the seeds.

40|$|Background & Objectives: Diabetes {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{diseases}} which is usually seen in modern societies. Due to the increased risk of the disease and its related complications, in addition to the harmless properties of <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds,</b> this research was aimed to study the effect of consuming <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds</b> on some biochemical factors in type 2 diabetic patients. Materials & Methods: This clinical trial has been carried out on 60 type 2 diabetic patients who were randomly divided into two groups of 30 <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds</b> consumers (case) and 30 non <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds</b> consumers (control). The case group was given 60 grams <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds</b> per day for 2 months and the control group did not receive any <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds.</b> The patient information was collected by questionnaire. The fasting blood serum of patients at the beginning and the end of the testing were collected and the biochemical factors of this study were measured in laboratory. For the data analysis, two independent samples t-test and paired t-test were used. Results: In this study, the mean ± SD (Standard Deviation) of the patients’ ages in the two groups, <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds</b> consumers (case) and non <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds</b> consumers (control), was 72 / 5 ± 40 / 52 and 11 / 6 ± 00 / 56 years, respectively. The results showed that fasting blood glucose, HbA 1 C, cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL (Low-density Lipoprotein), ALT (Alanine Transaminase) and ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase) were statistically decreased after the consumption of <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds</b> (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: According to the results, and by considering the <b>sesame</b> <b>seeds</b> harmless effects, it can be suggested that probably this plant is useful as a complementary therapy for treatment and prevention of diabetes disorders...|$|R
