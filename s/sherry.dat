Claire arrives in the Midwestern United States town of Raccoon City to find it overrun by zombies. She soon meets up with a rookie cop Leon S. Kennedy, but along the way she is separated from him. The rest of the game focuses on Claire's struggle to escape from the city alive. She maintains radio contact with Leon and teams up with a young girl named <b>Sherry,</b> while fighting against the various undead creatures infesting the Raccoon Police Department building, including the mutated scientist William Birkin. Claire eventually escapes from the city through the Umbrella Corporation's underground research complex along with Leon and <b>Sherry,</b> after the three of them manage to destroy Birkin.

5|$|During {{the events}} of Resident Evil 2, Leon is a rookie police officer who arrives in the doomed Raccoon City late for his {{first day on the}} job, only to confront a zombie {{outbreak}} first-hand. During the course of the game, he teams up with civilian survivor Claire Redfield, rescues the young <b>Sherry</b> Birkin, and is aided by the mysterious Ada Wong. Six years later, in Resident Evil 4, Leon returns as a secret service agent for the U.S. federal government assigned to rescue the president's daughter from a sinister cult. In Resident Evil 6, he continues to work for the U.S. government and reunites with Ada and a grown-up <b>Sherry.</b>|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Claire is {{reunited with}} <b>Sherry</b> and discovers that the mutated Birkin has {{implanted}} his daughter with an embryo to produce offspring. Leon, Ada, Claire and <b>Sherry</b> advance through an abandoned factory connected to Umbrella's secret underground research facility. An attack by Birkin leaves Ada heavily wounded, and Leon explores the laboratory {{to find something}} to treat her wounds. He is interrupted by a psychotic Annette, who explains to him that Ada's relationship with John was only a means of getting information about Umbrella: Ada is a spy sent to steal the G-virus for an unknown organization. Just as Annette is about to shoot Leon, the Tyrant appears, and she is forced to retreat. Ada returns to save Leon and battles the Tyrant – which falls into a pit of molten metal – seemingly at the cost of her own life. She confesses her love to Leon, who leaves behind her motionless body. Meanwhile, Annette tries to escape with another sample of the G-virus but is fatally wounded by her mutated husband. However, before she dies, she tells Claire how to create a vaccine that will stop the mutations caused by the embryo within <b>Sherry.</b> After preparing the cure, Leon and Claire reunite at an emergency escape train and inject <b>Sherry</b> with the vaccine, which saves her life. En route, Leon is assisted in terminating the now-mutated Tyrant by a woman in shadow, implying Ada's survival and escape with the G-virus in the pendant. Birkin– now mutated into a large agglomeration of flesh and teeth– follows the protagonists, but is destroyed when a self-destruct system causes the train to explode. After escaping from the city with <b>Sherry,</b> Leon intends to take down Umbrella, while Claire continues to search for her brother. Hunk, one of the special agents sent by Umbrella, is able to successfully complete his G-virus retrieval mission.|$|E

5|$|The Dodgers re-tied {{the game}} the next inning, however. Neal singled with one out and Wally Moon {{grounded}} into a force out at second base. Moon then advanced to second on a Larker single and scored on a Gil Hodges single to make the score 2–2. Don Demeter hit a single, the third consecutive and fourth of the inning, to load the bases but John Roseboro flew out to end the inning without further scoring. <b>Sherry</b> held the Braves scoreless {{in the bottom of}} the third, opening the inning with a walk but then inducing a double play and a foul out to quickly close it. <b>Sherry</b> and Willey traded scoreless innings in the fourth and fifth although the Braves threatened against <b>Sherry</b> in both innings, allowing two base-runners each time but escaping with no runs. Roseboro led off the top of the sixth inning with a home run to give the Dodgers a 3–2 lead. Roseboro had also hit a home run the day before against the Chicago Cubs, a game the Dodgers won to force the tie-breaker.

5|$|Accompanied by Brady, Hindley {{approached}} 12-year-old John Kilbride in {{the early}} evening of 23 November 1963, at a market in Ashton-under-Lyne and offered him a lift home on the pretext that his parents would be worried about him being out so late. With the added inducement of a bottle of <b>sherry,</b> Kilbride readily agreed to get into the Ford Anglia car that Hindley had hired. Brady told Kilbride that the <b>sherry</b> was at their home, and they would have to make a detour to collect it. On the way he suggested that they take another detour, to search for a glove he said that Hindley had lost on the moor. When they reached the moor Brady took the child with him while Hindley waited in the car. Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and attempted to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before fatally strangling him with a piece of string, possibly a shoelace.|$|E

5|$|In the oil platform, Chris and Piers head underground, {{managing}} to free Jake and <b>Sherry</b> from captivity before preventing a large-scale attack by a gigantic bioweapon called Haos from the location. Heavily wounded, {{and in a}} desperate attempt to save Chris, Piers injects himself with a sample of the C-virus to help turn the tide of the battle, temporarily defeating Haos before evacuating. Aware that the mutation would worsen, Piers sacrifices himself by pushing Chris to an escape pod. After Chris' pod is launched, Haos makes one last attempt to kill Chris but is killed himself by a powerful lightning charge from Piers, which ensures Chris' escape and the destruction of the Neo-Umbrella base. At the same time, Jake and <b>Sherry</b> escape the facility pursued relentlessly by Ustanak, eventually {{managing to}} kill him as they ride a rocket-powered lift back to the surface.|$|E
5|$|It is {{revealed}} that Leon's superior officer, Raccoon City police chief Brian Irons, had been bribed by Umbrella to hide {{evidence of the}} company's experiments in {{the outskirts of the}} city. He also concealed their development of the new G-virus, an agent capable of mutating a human into the ultimate bioweapon. Leon has multiple encounters with a Tyrant monster air-dropped into the Raccoon Police Department by Umbrella to seek the G-virus. Irons tries to murder Claire but is killed by a G-virus mutant in the police department. Thereupon, Claire and <b>Sherry</b> escape through the sewers and become separated. After splitting up with Leon, Ada comes upon <b>Sherry</b> and picks up a golden pendant the girl loses while running away. Further into the sewers, Ada reluctantly teams up with Leon again, after he insists on his duty to protect her. They encounter a middle-aged woman who fires at Ada, but Leon dives between them and takes a bullet himself. Ada ignores the unconscious Leon and follows the woman, who reveals herself to be Sherry's mother Annette and the wife of William Birkin, the Umbrella scientist who created the G-virus. In an attempt to protect his life's work from special agents sent by the Umbrella headquarters, he injected himself with the virus, which turned him into the malformed creature that is now chasing <b>Sherry.</b> Annette recognizes her daughter's pendant and attempts to take it from Ada. A fight ensues, during which Annette is thrown over a railing. Ada learns that the golden locket contains a sample of the G-virus, and later– taken over by her emotions– returns to Leon, tending to his bullet wound.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Sherry's</b> work {{varies from}} {{landscape}} and studio photography, to collage and sculpture, {{often with a}} heavy focus on color. Working with analogue film and printing techniques [...] "the use of anachronistic, primitive methods reflects a concern with craft, introducing {{the hand of the}} artist into a medium most commonly associated with mechanical reproduction." [...] <b>Sherry's</b> work often merges human and natural subjects, creating images in which landscapes take on anthropomorphic qualities and the humans in them become part of the landscape, as opposed to inhabitants. His exhibition [...] "Astral Desert", at Salon 94 gallery in New York City explored the topography of the desert and American West through multiple processes pushing photography to a [...] "chromatic extreme." [...] In the exhibitions [...] "Climate Vortex Sutra" [...] and [...] "Paradise Fire" [...] <b>Sherry's</b> work continued to explore themes of queer landscape, as well as climate change and its effects on the American landscape. <b>Sherry's</b> insertion of queer themes into the trajectory of modernist photography gives us space to stop and consider the erotic body of the image itself...
