5|$|Female {{homosexuality}} has {{not received}} the same negative response from religious or criminal authorities as male homosexuality or adultery has throughout history. Whereas <b>sodomy</b> between men, men and women, and men and animals was punishable by death in Britain, acknowledgment of sexual contact between women was nonexistent in medical and legal texts. The earliest law against female homosexuality appeared in France in 1270. In Spain, Italy, and the Holy Roman Empire, <b>sodomy</b> between women was included in acts considered unnatural and punishable by burning to death, although few instances are recorded of this taking place.|$|E
5|$|Ian McCormick diagnoses the {{pamphlet}} as representing a gradual change in European {{discourse on the}} character of the sodomite: previous publications had discussed sexual deviance (conceived in contemporary terms) as a general evil; with Satan's Harvest Home a new attention was brought to the individual character of persons who committed <b>sodomy.</b> He argues that 'before the seventeenth century, <b>sodomy</b> was not even precisely differentiated from its demonic associations with werewolves, heretics, sorcerers, and the like. Increasingly, however, it came to be linked with pride, excess of diet, idleness, and contempt of the poor.' The pamphlet's equation of effeminacy with homosexuality is identified by Michael Kimmel as distinctive for the period.|$|E
5|$|In the United States on February 21, 1903, New York police {{conducted}} the first recorded raid on a gay bathhouse, the Ariston Hotel Baths. 26 men {{were arrested and}} 12 brought to trial on <b>sodomy</b> charges; 7 men received sentences ranging from 4 to 20 years in prison.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{material}} in the pamphlet appears to be either a straight reprint or plagiarism of older material, including from a 1734 text, Pretty Doings in a Protestant Nation, by the pseudonymous Father Poussin. Part of the same section also seems to have appeared in William Walsh's 1691 A Dialogue Concerning Women. Another reused source is a c.1731 (1720 in some sources) pamphlet, Plain Reasons for the Growth of <b>Sodomy</b> in England.|$|E
5|$|Besides the budget, another {{measure that}} failed to pass in the 2002 session was a bill to {{eliminate}} {{the death penalty for}} juveniles. The precedent for the juvenile death penalty had been set in the 1989 Supreme Court case of Stanford v. Kentucky, wherein the court ruled that Kevin Stanford could be executed for the 1981 rape, <b>sodomy,</b> and murder of a gas station attendant in Jefferson County, Kentucky, even though Stanford was only 17 {{at the time of the}} crime. In 2003, Patton announced he would commute Stanford's sentence. Patton did oversee the execution of two adult prisoners in 1997 and 1999, making him the first Kentucky governor to do so since 1962.|$|E
5|$|After Charles Parham began {{promoting}} {{the idea that}} speaking in tongues was the initial evidence of the baptism in the Spirit around 1901, he began to attract a considerable following which he organized loosely as the Apostolic Faith Movement (AFM) in 1906. However, {{with the rise of}} the Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles, California, and an accusation of <b>sodomy</b> against him in 1907, he lost and never recovered his influence. After renouncing Parham, the severely weakened AFM regrouped around Howard A. Goss, L. C. Hall, D. C. O. Opperman, and A. G. Canada. They were later joined by Eudorus N. Bell, previously a Southern Baptist minister. The AFM had its strength in the rural areas of Kansas, Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, Edward and Gaveston {{may have}} simply been {{friends with a}} close working relationship. Contemporary chronicler {{comments}} are vaguely worded; Orleton's allegations were {{at least in part}} politically motivated, and are very similar to the highly politicised <b>sodomy</b> allegations made against Pope Boniface VIII and the Knights Templar in 1303 and 1308 respectively. Later accounts by chroniclers of Edward's activities may trace back to Orleton's original allegations, and were certainly adversely coloured by the events at the end of Edward's reign. Such historians as Michael Prestwich and Seymour Phillips have argued that the public nature of the English royal court would have made it unlikely that any homosexual affairs would have remained discreet; neither the contemporary Church, Edward's father nor his father-in-law appear to have made any adverse comments about Edward's sexual behaviour.|$|E
5|$|Florentine {{court records}} of 1476 show that Leonardo {{and three other}} young men were charged with <b>sodomy</b> but acquitted; {{homosexual}} acts were illegal in Renaissance Florence. From that date until 1478 {{there is no record}} of his work or even of his whereabouts. In 1478, he left Verrocchio's studio and was no longer a resident at his father's house. One writer, called the Anonimo Gaddiano, claims that in 1480 Leonardo was living with the Medici and working in the Garden of the Piazza San Marco in Florence, a Neo-Platonic academy of artists, poets and philosophers that the Medici had established. In January 1478, he received an independent commission to paint an altarpiece for the Chapel of St. Bernard in the Palazzo Vecchio; in March 1481, he received a second independent commission for The Adoration of the Magi for the monks of San Donato a Scopeto. Neither commission was completed, the second being interrupted when Leonardo went to Milan.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, the California Supreme Court affirmed in Stoumen v. Reilly {{the right}} of homosexuals to {{assemble}} peacefully. To assist homosexuals with legal problems, in 1951 labor activist Harry Hay started the Mattachine Society, from his living room in Los Angeles. A few years later, Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin started the Daughters of Bilitis with six other women in San Francisco, initially {{to have a place}} to socialize without fear of harassment or arrest. Within a few years, both organizations learned of each other and grew to have similar goals: helping assimilate homosexuals into general society, working for legal reform to repeal <b>sodomy</b> laws, and assisting those who were arrested. Both groups were headquartered in San Francisco by 1957.|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} occupations could be chosen or {{inherited}} from a father's line of work. This would include – {{but was not}} limited to – coffinmakers, ironworkers and blacksmiths, tailors, cooks and noodle-makers, retail merchants, tavern, teahouse, or winehouse managers, shoemakers, seal cutters, pawnshop owners, brothel heads, and merchant bankers engaging in a proto-banking system involving notes of exchange. Virtually every town had a brothel where female and male prostitutes could be had. Male catamites fetched a higher price than female concubines since pederasty with a teenage boy was seen as a mark of elite status, regardless of <b>sodomy</b> being repugnant to sexual norms. Public bathing became much more common than in earlier periods. Urban shops and retailers sold a variety of goods such as special paper money to burn at ancestral sacrifices, specialized luxury goods, headgear, fine cloth, teas, and others. Smaller communities and townships too poor or scattered to support shops and artisans obtained their goods from periodic market fairs and traveling peddlers. A small township also provided a place for simple schooling, news and gossip, matchmaking, religious festivals, traveling theater groups, tax collection, and bases of famine relief distribution.|$|E
5|$|The Castellania was {{the supreme}} court of justice of the islands, hence called Gran Corte or the {{variants}} in legal documents. The Grand Master had the absolute power to preside over the institution. The Papacy quarreled for a superior decision, such as when there was conflict with the court of the Bishop, but citing sovereignty of the princely Grand Master it was never conceded. With the presence of the Inquisition, the Holy See considered Malta similar to a colony, but through the Castellania the Order kept rigid control and sovereignty over Malta. Though the Inquisition had the power to issue a death penalty in cases related to religion, such as heresy, fornication and <b>sodomy,</b> it generally left it at the discretion of the Castellania. In its time, the Castellania was considered to be a secular court, and the law was amended with the issue of a Bando by the Grand Master. In military context the knights were not subject to the Castellania, and were instead prosecuted at the Military Tribunal (Tribunale Militare), however it received assistance from the higher hierarchy of the Castellania such as from the judge of the criminal court.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, the Dunstan Government {{stepped up}} its {{legislative}} efforts. Some bills, {{such as the one}} to remove the <b>sodomy</b> law and decriminalise male homosexuality, had been initially blocked by the Legislative Council. However, the bill to abolish capital punishment passed with ease, and the homosexuality law reforms eventually passed in September. Rape law was properly codified and defined as a crime within marriage {{for the first time in}} Australia. Shopping hours, previously the most restrictive in the nation, became the most open. Following a royal commission, Friday night shopping was introduced for the city and Thursday night shopping for the suburbs. The deposits on beverage containers was finally passed. The first signs of Monarto's eventual failure began to appear: birth rates started dropping significantly, immigration slowed and the economy was stagnant. South Australia's robust population growth, previously the highest per capita among the states, came to an abrupt halt. However, state money continued to be poured into the Monarto project, despite the fact that the Whitlam government cut funding to $600,000 in 1975, while his Liberal successor Malcolm Fraser gave nothing at all the following year. However, by the time Monarto was eventually scrapped after Dunstan's departure, no less than $20 million had been used to buy land, plant trees and formulate development plans, and the failed project is often seen as Dunstan's greatest failure. In addition, the federal government removed subsidies for shipbuilding at Whyalla, forcing the operations to be scaled down.|$|E
25|$|Bowers v. Hardwick, , is a United States Supreme Court decision, {{overturned}} in 2003, that upheld, in a 5–4 ruling, {{the constitutionality}} of a Georgia <b>sodomy</b> law criminalizing oral and anal sex in private between consenting adults, in this case with respect to homosexual <b>sodomy,</b> though the law did not differentiate between homosexual <b>sodomy</b> and heterosexual <b>sodomy.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, {{all states}} had {{some form of}} law criminalizing <b>sodomy,</b> and in 1986 the United States Supreme Court ruled that nothing in the United States Constitution bars a state from prohibiting <b>sodomy.</b> However, state legislators and state courts had started to repeal or {{overturn}} their <b>sodomy</b> laws, beginning with Illinois in 1961, and thus in 2003, only 10 states had laws prohibiting all <b>sodomy,</b> with penalties ranging from 1 to 15 years imprisonment. Additionally, four other states had laws that specifically prohibited same-sex <b>sodomy.</b>|$|E
25|$|Chad in 2016 {{passed a}} law criminalising <b>sodomy,</b> which had {{previously}} been legal. Conversely, some African states like Lesotho, Sao Tome and Principe, Mozambique, and the Seychelles have abolished <b>sodomy</b> laws in recent years. The new penal code of Angola will abolish the country's <b>sodomy</b> laws, which are no longer enforced.|$|E
25|$|On April 16, Washington County {{prosecutor}} John Rupp filed {{additional charges}} against Devlin, which {{accused him of}} attempted murder, kidnapping, armed criminal action, three counts of forcible <b>sodomy</b> and one count of attempted forcible <b>sodomy.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 2003, while Cruz was Texas Solicitor General, the Texas Attorney General's office {{declined}} to defend Texas' <b>sodomy</b> law in Lawrence v. Texas, where the U.S. Supreme Court decided that state laws banning homosexual sex as illegal <b>sodomy</b> were unconstitutional.|$|E

25|$|In Lawrence v. Texas (2003), the Court {{struck down}} a Texas statute prohibiting {{homosexual}} <b>sodomy</b> on substantive due process grounds. In Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's opinion concurring in the judgment, however, she argued that by prohibiting only homosexual <b>sodomy,</b> and not heterosexual <b>sodomy</b> as well, Texas's statute did not meet rational-basis review under the Equal Protection Clause; her opinion prominently cited City of Cleburne, and also relied in part on Romer. Notably, O'Connor's opinion did not claim to apply {{a higher level of}} scrutiny than mere rational basis, and the Court has not extended suspect-class status to sexual orientation.|$|E

25|$|During the trial, Mahathir {{appeared}} on Malaysian television {{in a special}} appearance to explain the arrest of his deputy. This {{was one of several}} occasions in which Mahathir declared Anwar guilty of <b>sodomy</b> and homosexual acts, even as the trial still was underway. The government included the statements of the purported victims of Anwar's <b>sodomy</b> attacks, evidence that was widely considered to be tainted. Furthermore, the prosecution was unable to accurately decide on a date that the alleged acts of anal sex had occurred – the government originally alleged that a <b>sodomy</b> had occurred inside a building that had not been constructed {{at the time of the}} alleged event.|$|E
25|$|After the French Revolution the anticlerical {{feeling in}} Catholic {{countries}} {{coupled with the}} liberalizing effect of the Napoleonic Code {{made it possible to}} sweep away <b>sodomy</b> laws. However, in Protestant countries, where the church was less severe, there was no general reaction against statutes that were religious in origin. As a result, many of those countries retained their statutes on <b>sodomy</b> until late in the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|An {{examination}} of trials for rape and <b>sodomy</b> during the 18th century at the Old Bailey in London {{shows that the}} treatment of rape was often lenient, while the treatment of <b>sodomy</b> was often severe. However, the difficulty of proving that penetration and ejaculation had occurred meant that men were often convicted of the lesser charge of 'assault with sodomitical intent', which was not a capital offence.|$|E
25|$|The Military Penal Law No. 19 of 2007 prohibits its {{men from}} {{engaging}} in homosexual <b>sodomy.</b>|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the formal}} disapproval of {{religious}} authority, gender segregation in Muslim societies {{and the strong}} emphasis on virility leads adolescents and unmarried young men to seek alternative sexual outlets to women, especially with males younger than themselves. Not all <b>sodomy</b> is homosexual, but for many young men heterosexual <b>sodomy</b> is considered better than vaginal penetration, and female prostitutes report the demand for anal penetration from their male clients.|$|E
25|$|A second {{guilty plea}} {{submitted}} before the Jackson County Court on August 24 earned Berdella a further life term without parole for one charge of forcible <b>sodomy</b> against Christopher Bryson (six counts of <b>sodomy</b> and one charge of assault being dropped {{as part of}} a plea bargain); he would also receive a further term of seven years pertaining to one count of felonious restraint against Bryson on this date.|$|E
25|$|In 1772, {{an episode}} in Marseille {{involved}} the non-lethal incapacitating of prostitutes with the supposed aphrodisiac Spanish fly and <b>sodomy</b> with Latour, his manservant. That year, {{the two men}} were sentenced to death in absentia for <b>sodomy</b> and the poisoning. They fled to Italy, Sade taking his wife's sister with him. Sade and Latour were caught and imprisoned at the Fortress of Miolans in late 1772, but escaped four months later.|$|E

25|$|Anwar stood {{trial on}} four charges of corruption, arising from {{allegations}} that Anwar abused his power by ordering police to intimidate persons who had alleged Anwar had sodomised them. Before Anwar's trial, Mahathir {{told the press}} that he was convinced of Anwar's guilt. He was found guilty in April 1999 and sentenced to six years in prison. In another trial shortly after, Anwar was sentenced to another nine years in prison on a conviction for <b>sodomy.</b> The <b>sodomy</b> conviction was overturned on appeal after Mahathir left office.|$|E
