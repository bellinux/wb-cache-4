5|$|Between 1997 and 2000 Mosley {{repeatedly}} {{warned that}} if any EU decision went against the FIA, the marketing organisations and F1 itself would be moved out of Europe. In 1999, the EU Commission Directorate-General for Competition issued a <b>Statement</b> <b>of</b> <b>Objections,</b> listing a number of grievances surrounding the FIA's dealings with Ecclestone and Formula One. The FIA released the Statement {{to the media and}} held a press conference in Brussels ridiculing the Commission’s case. The Commission argued that a number of commercial agreements could be viewed as anti-competition and invited the FIA and Ecclestone's companies, ISC and FOA, to submit proposals to modify these arrangements. In 2001, nine months after settlement talks had begun, the parties reached an agreement to amend existing contracts, which included Ecclestone stepping down as the FIA's vice-president of promotional affairs and the FIA ending all involvement in the commercial activities of Formula One.|$|E

Eventually the European Commissioner for Competition, Mario Monti, approved a dawn raid on SAS and Maersk, which took place on 15 June 2000.

5000|$|Philosopher George Berkeley, in his work, A Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge (1710), proposes, [...] "But, say you, {{surely there}} is nothing easier than for me to imagine trees, for instance, in a park ... and nobody by to {{perceive}} them. ... The objects of sense exist only when they are perceived; the trees therefore are in the garden ... no longer than while there is somebody by to perceive them."

If Congress is in session, the bill automatically becomes law, without the president's signature, only with a two thirds majority of both houses. If, however, Congress adjourned during that 10-day period, the bill fails to become law in a procedural device known as the [...] "pocket veto". The bill becomes [...] "mute".|$|R

60|$|How {{was this}} to be done? Lady Verinder was dead. Rachel and I, {{so long as the}} {{suspicion}} of theft rested on me, were parted irrevocably. Godfrey Ablewhite was away travelling on the Continent. It was simply impossible to reassemble the people who had inhabited the house, when I had slept in it last. The <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> this <b>objection</b> did not appear to embarrass Ezra Jennings. He attached very little importance, he said, to reassembling the same people--seeing that it would be vain to expect them to reassume the various positions which they had occupied towards me in the past times. On the other hand, he considered it essential {{to the success of the}} experiment, that I should see the same objects about me which had surrounded me when I was last in the house.|$|R
40|$|Pharmaceutical {{antitrust}} {{is currently}} a centre of attention for the European Commission, with one decision against Lundbeck and <b>Statements</b> <b>of</b> <b>Objections</b> in investigations against Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, and Les Laboratoires Servier. This thesis {{is the first to}} develop in detail a ‘European approach’ to pay for delay settlements and early entry agreements – two types of conduct identified by the European pharmaceutical sector inquiry. Although pay for delay settlements have received extensive antitrust scrutiny in the United States, one has to be cautious when drawing from this expertise, as the underlying regulatory regimes are fundamentally different in Europe and the US. This need for careful comparative analyses in pharmaceutical antitrust and the fact that similar conduct might have to be treated differently {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic is showcased by a case study of the General Court’s AstraZeneca judgment. The analysis shows that the General Court was correct to dismiss AstraZeneca’s claim that its conduct would not have led to antitrust scrutiny following the US Walker Process Doctrine, which in fact covers similar conduct. Additionally, the hypothetical application of the market definition in AstraZeneca to the market of anti-epileptic drugs highlights the difficulties that the European Commission might encounter in its future enforcement in the pharmaceutical sector. Based on the different incentives for the parties of EU pay for delay settlements, a novel European theory of harm is developed for pay for delay settlements and early entry agreements, the latter posing significant anticompetitive potential in Europe. Based on this theory, pay for delay settlements are scrutinised under EU competition law and a novel “structured effects-based” test is proposed that is inspired by the recent Actavis judgment of the US Supreme Court. In terms of early entry agreements, this thesis is the first to apply EU competition law...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to present the issues <b>of</b> binding force <b>statement</b> <b>of</b> intent expressing <b>objection</b> to taking saving life actions in case of such a need in the future. This problem becomes current when a patient is {{unconscious}} and they cannot express their will basing on an assessment of all of the circumstances regarding their health. In the study the current legal status and judicature are being analysed. The analysis leads to the conclusion that the lack of legal regulations in Poland concerning the so-called statements pro futuro precludes a doctor from making a right assessment of his duties in the context of criminal responsibility for their negligence. It concerns both a duty to act and a negligence of life or health saving actions. The lack of legal criteria assessments of a doctor’s responsibility in the context of criminal responsibility for their negligence precludes from acknowledging statements pro futuro as obliging to negligence of treatment. The Polish law guarantees the patient the right to the self – determination in insufficient way but the constitutional principle of specificity of an offence (nullum crimen sine lege) does not give a permission to attribute criminal responsibility to the doctor for performing intervention despite the existence <b>of</b> such a <b>statement,</b> because the prohibition of undertaking the medical interventions in case <b>of</b> an <b>objection</b> raised before occurrence of the situation that needs such an intervention must have a source in the binding rules...|$|R
50|$|The Exercitationes excited much attention, {{though they}} contain {{little or nothing}} beyond what others had already {{advanced}} against Aristotle. The first book expounds clearly, and with much vigour, the evil effects of the blind acceptance of the Aristotelian dicta on physical and philosophical study; but, as occurs with {{so many of the}} anti-Aristotelian works of this period, the objections show the usual ignorance of Aristotle's own writings. The second book, which contains the review of Aristotle's dialectic or logic, throughout reflects Ramism in tone and method.

The anti-ANI legislation, unsuccessfully rejected by President Bǎsescu, was received with strong criticism by various journalists, political commentators {{and civil society}} opinion leaders. Revista 22 panelist Andreea Pora summarized Frunda's attempts to fight the ANI law, dating back to Monica Macovei's 2005 proposals, and described Frunda as a [...] "devil's advocate" [...] for those who wanted [...] "a free passage to deals, wrongdoings and theft". She {{also noted that the}} senator was himself a reputed target for ANI investigators. Writing in 2002 for România Literară review, academic Mircea Mihăieş contrasted Frunda's [...] "new tone and elegance" [...] of the 1990s with his support of Social Democratic moves to keep dignitaries' fortunes under secrecy. Cristian Ghinea, who spoke of several attempts on Frunda's part to redefine the scope of ANI investigations as favoring the corrupt under the pretext of human rights concerns (and against the scope of European monitoring), ridiculed the association of interests between Frunda and the new National Liberal leader, Crin Antonescu.|$|R

The application was submitted by the end of March, and an objection was soon received from The Regency Society. The conservation group, founded in 1945 by a group of architects, MPs and other prominent residents, stated that the wheel would affect the residential area of the East Cliff because houses would be overlooked, sea views would be blocked and a major tourist attraction was unsuitable for what was a [...] "relatively quiet area" [...] of the seafront. After taking this and other <b>statements</b> <b>of</b> support and <b>objection</b> into account, Brighton and Hove City Council granted temporary planning permission until May 2016 during a meeting on 27 April 2011. The council granted permission for the wheel to be open between 10:00 am and midnight each day, but Paramount subsequently changed the closing time to 11:00 pm.
