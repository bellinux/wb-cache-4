40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the potential of}} economies of scale and scope among the African central securities depository institutions. We address whether the consolidation <b>of</b> settlement and <b>custody</b> activities <b>of</b> <b>securities</b> make these institutions efficient {{in light of the}} costs of service parameter. To do this, we rely on the translog cost function [introduced by Christensen et al. (1971) ] and the constant elasticity of substitution <b>of</b> seven central <b>securities</b> depositories in Africa over the period 2004 - 2009. The results show the existence of significant economies of scale and scope in these institutions. The extent of these economies differs upon the size of the institution and the level of automation mechanisms to combine securities settlement and custody activities. Our findings also indicate that, unlike large institutions in countries such as South Africa and Mauritius, which have heavily invested in automation mechanisms, smaller institutions have higher service costs, which implies a need for consolidation of activities to reduce these costs.
