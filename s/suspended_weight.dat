If the arch becomes very large, the projections under the flanks must become too ponderous to be secure; the <b>suspended</b> <b>weight</b> of stone would be liable to break off, and such arches are therefore never constructed with heavy cusps, but rendered secure by general mass of masonry; and what additional appearance of support may be thought necessary (sometimes a considerable degree of actual support) is given by means of tracery.|$|E
6000|$|Needless enough surely {{to declare}} that such pages were {{essentially}} not love-letters: that they could scarce have been less so seems exactly part of their noble inevitability, {{as well as a}} proof singularly interesting and charming that confident friendship may obey its force and insist on its say quite as much as the sentiment we are apt to take, as to many of its occasions, for the supremely vocal. We have so often seen this latter beat distressfully about the bush for something still deficient, something in the line of positive esteem or constructive respect, whether offered or enjoyed, that an esteem and a respect such as we here apprehend, explicit enough on either side to dispense with those superlatives in which graceless reaction has been known insidiously to lurk, peculiarly refresh and instruct us. The fine special quietude of the relation thus promoted in a general consciousness of unrest--and even if it could breed questions too, since a relation that breeds none at all is not a living one--was of the highest value to the author of my letters, who had already sufficiently [...] "lived," [...] in her generous way, to know well enough in how different a quarter to look for the grand inconclusive. The directness, the ease, the extent of the high consideration, the felt need of it as a support, indeed one may almost say as an inspiration, in trouble, and the free gift of it as a delightful act of intelligence and justice, render the whole exhibition, to my sense, admirable in its kind. Questions luckily could haunt it, as I say and as we shall presently see, but only to illustrate the more all the equilibrium preserved. I confess I can imagine no tribute to a manly nature from a feminine more final even than the confidence in [...] "mere" [...] consideration here embodied--the comfort of the consideration being {{in the fact that the}} character with which the feminine nature was dealing lent it, could it but come, such weight. We seem to see play through the whole appeal of the younger person to the somewhat older an invocation of the weight <b>suspended,</b> <b>weight</b> of judgment, weight of experience and authority, and which may ever so quietly drop. How kindly in another relation it had been in fact capable of dropping comes back to me in the mention of my brother Wilky, as to whom this aspect of his admiring friendship for our young relative's correspondent, the fruit of their common military service roundabout Charleston, again comprehensively testifies. That comradeship was a privilege that Wilky strongly cherished, as well as what one particularly liked to think for him of his having known--he was to have known nothing more fortunate. In no less a degree was our elder brother to come to prize his like share in the association--this being sufficiently indicated, for that matter, in the note I have quoted from him. That I have prized my own share in it let my use of this benefit derived strongly represent. But again for Minnie herself the sadder admonition is sharp, and I find I know not what lonely pluck in her relapses shaken off as with the jangle of silver bells, her expert little efforts to live them down, Newport and other matters aiding and the general preoccupied good will all vainly at her service. Pitiful in particular her carrying her trouble experimentally back to the Newport of the first gladness of her girlhood and of the old bright spectacle.|$|E

There tends to be some overlap in certain larger weighted vests and the region covered by certain larger weighted belts near the upper abdominal muscles.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} support {{requirements for}} the proposed monorail system {{to be used in}} decline development. The monorail drilling and loading systems are systems that move on the rail (monorail) installed in the roof of the decline and supported by roof bolts, suspension chains and steel supports. However, due to the weight of the components of the two systems, it is imperative that the force in each roof bolt, suspension chain and steel support capable of <b>suspending</b> the <b>weight</b> of the heaviest component is determined. Numerical models that relate the weight of the monorail drilling and loading components to the required strength in the support system have been developed.

50|$|An {{advantage}} to the Horstmann design is that the <b>suspended</b> <b>weight</b> is not placed entirely on the rising wheel: its paired partner will also increase its downward force due to the shared spring, spreading the load. In systems with fully independent wheels, {{it is possible for}} the entire tank to become suspended on one wheel, which is rare in the Horstmann case. Another advantage is that the spring may work both in compression and expansion, increasing the total travel of the suspension. From a maintenance standpoint, the fact that the spring connects at a single non-moving point and is otherwise self-contained makes it easy to remove and replace in the field. The location of the spring over the wheels also makes it quite compact, with little or no encroachment on internal hull space.|$|E

50|$|Depending upon {{air density}} and the jumper’s total weight, the parachute’s {{average rate of}} descent is from 22 to 24 ft/s; total <b>suspended</b> <b>weight</b> {{limitation}} is 360 lb. The parachute is deployed using either a 15 or 20 ft static line, allowing the parachutist to be delivered by either C-130 or C-17 aircraft. The T-10D main parachute is a parabolic-shape and has a nominal diameter of 35 ft with 30 suspension lines. The entire assembly weighs 31 lb. Paratroopers can be dropped from an aircraft at a maximum speed of 173 mph, at a minimum of 500 ft. Maximum jump wind speed is 15 mph. The T-10D Parachute assembly consists of five components: pack tray, troop harness, deployment bag, risers, and canopy. The parachute has a combined service life of 16.5 years; service life is 12 years and shelf life is 4.5 years. The T-10D Parachute must be repacked every 120 days. The T-10D Parachute is made of nylon materials commonly used in the manufacturing of parachutes.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} method {{was developed for}} evaluating the effect of component compression on the charge and discharge voltage characteristics of a 3 1 / 2 in. diameter boiler plate cell. A standard boiler plate pressure vessel was modified {{by the addition of}} a mechanical feedthrough {{on the bottom of the}} vessel which permitted different compressions to be applied to the components without disturbing the integrity of the stack. Compression loadings from 0. 94 to 27. 4 psi were applied by <b>suspending</b> <b>weights</b> from the feedthrough rod. Cell voltages were measured for 0. 96 -C, 55 -min charge and for 1. 37 -C, 35 -min and 2 -C, 24 -min discharges. An initial change in voltage performance on both charge and discharge as the loading increased was attributed to seating of the components. Subsequent variation of the compression from 2. 97 to 27. 4 psi caused only minor changes in either the charge or the discharge voltages. Several one month open-circuit voltage stands and 1100 cycles under LEO conditions at the maximum loading have produced no change in performance...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we report our new {{approach}} to synthesize cation-exchanged Laponite suspensions. General observations of the prepared samples indicated that an aqueous suspension of 1 wt% Laponite retained its free flowing liquid phase characteristics even after aging for several weeks. When bivalent cationic metals (Cu, Co, Ni) were ablated into the suspension, the strong charge of the crystal face was reduced and, on standing, the suspension gelled becoming highly viscous. This sol-gel transition was induced by {{the formation of a}} space-filled structure due to both van derWaals and electrostatic bonds between the positively charged rims and negatively charged faces. Rheological properties of such prepared suspensions were measured using a Brookfield DV-H Pro Viscometer with a small sample adapter{SSA 18 / 13 RPY). The yield strengths of 2. 2 N/m 2, 3. 2 N/m 2, and 1. 7 N/m 2 were measured for Ni-, Co-, and Cu-modified Laponite suspensions, respectively.

5000|$|An {{escapement}} is {{a device}} in mechanical {{watches and clocks}} that transfers energy to the timekeeping element (the [...] "impulse action") and allows the number of its oscillations to be counted (the [...] "locking action"). The impulse action transfers energy to the clock's timekeeping element (usually a pendulum or balance wheel) to replace the energy lost to friction during its cycle and keep the timekeeper oscillating. The escapement is driven by force from a coiled spring or a <b>suspended</b> <b>weight,</b> transmitted through the timepiece's gear train. Each swing of the pendulum or balance wheel releases a tooth of the escapement's escape wheel gear, allowing the clock's gear train to advance or [...] "escape" [...] by a fixed amount. This regular periodic advancement moves the clock's hands forward at a steady rate. At {{the same time the}} tooth gives the timekeeping element a push, before another tooth catches on the escapement's pallet, returning the escapement to its [...] "locked" [...] state. The sudden stopping of the escapement's tooth is what generates the characteristic [...] "ticking" [...] sound heard in operating mechanical clocks and watches.|$|E
50|$|Safely on the Moon, they {{explore the}} lunar surface, {{reporting}} back by radio how {{their view of}} the Earth looks contrasted against the black lunar sky; one crew member photographs another pretending to hold up the Earth like a modern Atlas. The story takes a serious turn when they calculate the mass needed to lighten their spaceship in the Moon's one-sixth gravity in order to get home safely with their remaining fuel. No matter how much non-critical equipment they remove and leave on the lunar surface, the hard numbers radioed from Earth continue to point to one conclusion: Someone will have to stay behind on the Moon if the other three crew are to return safely to Earth. With time running out for their return launch window, the crew engineers their way home. They first jettison the ship's heavy radio equipment, losing contact with Earth, and finally their sole remaining space suit. An oxygen tank is used as a tethered, <b>suspended</b> <b>weight</b> to pull the space suit outside through the open airlock, which is then remotely closed and resealed.

5000|$|Errors {{associated}} with the stick method and the clinometer and tape method: Aside from the obvious errors {{associated with}} bad measurements of distances or misreading the angles with the clinometer, there are several less apparent sources of error that can compromise {{the accuracy of the}} tree height calculations. With the stick method if the stick is not held vertically, the similar triangle will be malformed. This potential error can be offset by fastening a string with a small, <b>suspended</b> <b>weight</b> {{to the top of the}} stick so that the stick can be aligned with the weighted string to assure it is being held vertically. A more pernicious error occurs in both methods where 1) the treetop is offset from the base of the tree, or 2) where the top of the tree has been misidentified. Except for young, plantation-grown conifers, the top of the tree is rarely directly over the base; therefore a right triangle used as the basis for the height calculation isn’t truly being formed. An analysis of data collected by the Native Tree Society (NTS), of over 1800 mature trees found, on average, the top of the tree was offset from the perspective of the surveyor by a distance of 8.3 feet (2.5 m), and therefore was offset from the base of the tree by around 13 feet (4 m). Conifers tended to have offsets less than that average and large, broad canopied hardwoods tended to have higher offsets. The top of the tree therefore has a different baseline length than the bottom of the tree resulting in height errors: ...|$|E
