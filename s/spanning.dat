5|$|In an undirected graph, a widest path may {{be found}} as the path between the two {{vertices}} in the maximum <b>spanning</b> tree of the graph, and a minimax path {{may be found}} as the path between the two vertices in the minimum <b>spanning</b> tree.|$|E
5|$|In nonplanar surface embeddings {{the set of}} dual edges {{complementary}} to a <b>spanning</b> tree is not a dual <b>spanning</b> tree. Instead {{this set}} of edges is the union of a dual <b>spanning</b> tree with a small set of extra edges whose number {{is determined by the}} genus of the surface on which the graph is embedded. The extra edges, in combination with paths in the <b>spanning</b> trees, can be used to generate the fundamental group of the surface.|$|E

50|$|Each <b>span</b> {{comprises}} 2No. riveted longitudinal {{steel deck}} girders, supporting riveted cross girders, {{which in turn}} support a reinforced concrete slab deck. The bridge has two sets of approach <b>spans,</b> {{each of which has}} three <b>spans,</b> either side of the central main lifting <b>span.</b> Each set of three <b>spans</b> consists of two simply supported end <b>spans</b> which continue as cantilevers approximately 1/5 <b>span</b> into the middle <b>span.</b> The central 3/5 <b>span</b> sections are simply supported drop in <b>spans</b> supported by halving joints. The main <b>span</b> is a structurally independent lifting <b>span.</b> The bearings are inset from the end lifting beams. <b>Spans</b> 1, 3, 5 and 7 are 24.994m c/c of bearings. <b>Spans</b> 2 and 6 are 26.213m, with halving joints 5.334m from both end and a 15.547m suspended <b>span.</b> The central lifting <b>span,</b> <b>Span</b> 4, is 31.242m c/c of bearings, with cantilevers of 3.124m either end to the lifting cross girders. The approach <b>spans</b> have cross girders spaced 2.438m apart, and the lifting girder has cross girders spaced 6.248m.|$|R
50|$|Work on {{the western}} {{highrise}} <b>span</b> was bid in October 1964 and commenced in 1965. It crosses a shipping channel, with an orthotropic main <b>span</b> that is 750 ft long (at the time, the longest girder <b>span</b> in the United States) and has a vertical clearance of 135 ft. The main <b>span</b> is flanked by two orthotropic back <b>spans</b> which are each 375 ft long, and there are seven orthotropic side <b>spans</b> on the approach to each back <b>span.</b> Each of these side <b>spans</b> are 292 ft long. Although these <b>spans</b> appear to be formed from continuous box girders, they consist of alternating anchor <b>spans</b> and suspended <b>spans.</b> Anchor <b>spans</b> rest on top of two adjacent piers and cantilever over each side slightly, and suspended <b>spans</b> are hung between the ends of two adjacent anchor <b>spans.</b> There are an additional nine 208 ft steel <b>spans</b> carrying a concrete deck on the San Mateo side of the highrise, and ten steel <b>spans</b> carrying a concrete deck on the Hayward side, ranging from 186 - 208 ft. The bridge carries about 93,000 cars and other vehicles on a typical day, almost double its original projected design capacity of 50,000 vehicles per day.|$|R
50|$|The Northport Bridge's {{total length}} is 1542 ft. The main <b>span</b> {{consists}} of a central <b>span</b> of 224 ft between 140 ft cantilever <b>spans,</b> for a total <b>span</b> of 504 ft. The steel anchor <b>spans</b> are 168 ft long, with additional concrete approach <b>spans.</b> The bridge opened to traffic on June 13, 1951, {{at a cost of}} $1,751,587.|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the forward digit <b>span</b> employs a verbal representation of sequences of digits, whereas the backward digit <b>span</b> employs a spatial representation. This was tested by comparing the two digit <b>spans</b> with a nonverbal analogue of the forward digit <b>span.</b> The latter did not explain any of the variation in the backward digit <b>span</b> when the forward digit <b>span</b> was statistically controlled. It is concluded that the two digit <b>spans</b> employ a common verbal representation...|$|R

5|$|If all edge weights of an {{undirected graph}} are positive, then the minimax {{distances}} between pairs of points (the maximum edge weights of minimax paths) form an ultrametric; conversely every finite ultrametric space comes from minimax distances in this way. A data structure constructed from the minimum <b>spanning</b> tree allows the minimax distance between any pair of vertices to be queried in constant time per query, using lowest common ancestor queries in a Cartesian tree. The {{root of the}} Cartesian tree represents the heaviest minimum <b>spanning</b> tree edge, {{and the children of}} the root are Cartesian trees recursively constructed from the subtrees of the minimum <b>spanning</b> tree formed by removing the heaviest edge. The leaves of the Cartesian tree represent the vertices of the input graph, and the minimax distance between two vertices equals the weight of the Cartesian tree node that is their lowest common ancestor. Once the minimum <b>spanning</b> tree edges have been sorted, this Cartesian tree can be constructed in linear time.|$|E
5|$|In {{geographic}} information systems, flow networks (such as the networks showing how water flows {{in a system}} of streams and rivers) are dual to cellular networks describing drainage divides. This duality can be explained by modeling the flow network as a <b>spanning</b> tree on a grid graph of an appropriate scale, and modeling the drainage divide as the complementary <b>spanning</b> tree of ridgelines on the dual grid graph.|$|E

50|$|In 1896 {{the third}} {{configuration}} of the bridge was completed. The northern <b>spans</b> and southern approach <b>spans</b> were all replaced. The northern <b>spans</b> were replaced by seventy-five <b>spans</b> of 9.14 m and one of 8.53 m, {{one of the longest}} timber beam bridges in Australia. The alignment of this new approach was slightly {{to the west of the}} previous (second) northern approach. The two southern <b>spans</b> of 9.14 m dating from 1865 were replaced by one <b>span</b> of 10.7 m and one of 8.5 m on the same alignment as the previous southern approach <b>spans.</b>|$|R

5|$|A small {{population}} at Dudinin, <b>spanning</b> a nature reserve and private property. This population is apparently in decline. No seedlings {{have ever been}} reported at this location, and from 1997 to 2004 the number of reported adults fell from around 110 to 13.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} this type of {{decomposition}} into interdigitating trees can be seen in some simple types of mazes, with a single entrance and no disconnected components of its walls. In this case both the maze walls and the space between the walls {{take the form of a}} mathematical tree. If the free space of the maze is partitioned into simple cells (such as the squares of a grid) then this system of cells can be viewed as an embedding of a planar graph, in which the tree structure of the walls forms a <b>spanning</b> tree of the graph and the tree structure of the free space forms a <b>spanning</b> tree of the dual graph. Similar pairs of interdigitating trees can also be seen in the tree-shaped pattern of streams and rivers within a drainage basin and the dual tree-shaped pattern of ridgelines separating the streams.|$|E
