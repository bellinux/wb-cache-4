In this issue of PNAS, Matsen and Nowak use a random search for another type of problem, that of finding coherence rather than optimality. The task thus consists of reaching unanimity. The proposed solution is outrageously simple: Keep switching until you agree with two others, then stop. Under a wide set of conditions, this <b>slapdash</b> recipe <b>works...</b>|$|R
