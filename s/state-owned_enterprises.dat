The ISR introduced formal criteria for joining a central inspection team and empowered its investigative authority.|$|E
5|$|The delegates {{approved}} the general secretary's Political Report, Report on Orientations and Tasks for Socio-Economic Development for the 2006–10 Period, and the Report on Party building and amendments {{made to the}} party statute. These reports' main objectives were to accelerate the reform process and strengthen the socialist-oriented market economy. The congress allowed existing party members to engage in private ownership. This was a controversial amendment and was a break with the theory of exploitation of man by man. While the amendment was approved, the third plenum of the 10th Central Committee restricted the change to party members who had worked in <b>state-owned</b> <b>enterprises</b> which have been privatized.|$|E

40|$|The <b>state-owned</b> <b>enterprise</b> {{is a type}} of a {{legal entity}} which is used in the Czech Republic as an {{alternative}} to founding of state-owned joint-stock companies. While the <b>state-owned</b> <b>enterprise</b> serves as a one of the possible ways of managing the state property, it is used to fulfil not only economical tasks, but also other kinds of state interest, such as social or security ones. The legal regulation of the <b>state-owned</b> <b>enterprise</b> recently undergone significant changes in reaction to the recodification of the civil law and the law of commercial corporations. The goal of this thesis called "State-owned enterprise and its property" is to analyse the legal regulation concerning the <b>state-owned</b> <b>enterprise</b> and the management of the state property performed by this legal entity in the context of other influential acts, to pinpoint the shortcomings and problems of the current legal regulation, to evaluate the nature of the <b>state-owned</b> <b>enterprise</b> as a legal entity, to determine the nature of the legal phenomenon of the right to manage the property of state and to evaluate the usefulness of the <b>state-owned</b> <b>enterprise</b> as a separate type of legal entity.

5|$|While {{supporting}} change, Trường Chinh in his Political Report {{talked about}} the validity of the party's organizational principles, which had governed Vietnam's economy. Democratic centralism was to remain unchanged, and centralized management of certain sectors were to be retained. In a closed session, the Presidium of the 6th National Congress on 18 December acknowledged the importance of the continued transformation of private industry and commerce and the validity of economic contracts between production and business units. He endorsed the state's role as a supplier of goods produced by <b>state-owned</b> <b>enterprises</b> and supported the long-time policy of labour distribution. These policies were passed, and underwrote the economic policies initiated at the 4th and 5th National Congresses. The party leadership's immediate goals set forth in the Political Report were: To restructure the production system; readjust the investment outlay within the system; continue the building and strengthening of the socialist relations of production; to utilize and develop the economic sectors in the correct way; to renovate the way economy was managed; to emphasize the role of science and technology in the economy; and to expand and to increase the effectiveness of Vietnam's foreign economic relations.|$|E

50|$|In market-based economies, {{state-owned}} {{assets are}} frequently managed and operated as joint-stock corporations {{with a government}} owning either all or a controlling stake of the shares. This form {{is often referred to}} as a <b>state-owned</b> <b>enterprise.</b> A <b>state-owned</b> <b>enterprise</b> might variously operate as a not-for-profit corporation, as it may not be required to generate a profit; as a commercial enterprise in competitive sectors; or as a natural monopoly. Governments may also use the profitable entities they own to support the general budget. The creation of a <b>state-owned</b> <b>enterprise</b> from other forms of public property is called corporatization.|$|R
25|$|In the pre-reform period, {{industry}} was largely stagnant and the socialist system presented few incentives for improvements in quality and productivity. With {{the introduction of}} the dual-price system and greater autonomy for enterprise managers, productivity increased greatly in the early 1980s. Foreign enterprises and newly formed Township and Village Enterprises, owned by local government and often de facto private firms, competed successfully with <b>state-owned</b> <b>enterprises.</b> By the 1990s, large-scale privatizations reduced the market share of both the Township and Village Enterprises and <b>state-owned</b> <b>enterprises</b> and increased the private sector's market share. The state sector's share of industrial output dropped from 81% in 1980 to 15% in 2005. Foreign capital controls much of Chinese industry and plays an important role.|$|E
25|$|In {{the other}} direction, China's growing thirst for raw {{materials}} led Chinese <b>state-owned</b> <b>enterprises</b> {{to the country}} with natural resources, such as wood and minerals (like those from the Gabonese forests).

25|$|The {{government}} has {{in recent years}} struggled to contain the social strife and environmental damage related to the economy's rapid transformation; collect public receipts due from provinces, businesses, and individuals; reduce corruption and other economic crimes; sustain adequate job growth for {{tens of millions of}} workers laid off from <b>state-owned</b> <b>enterprises,</b> migrants, and new entrants to the work force; and keep afloat the large <b>state-owned</b> <b>enterprises,</b> most of which had not participated in the vigorous expansion of the economy and many of which had been losing the ability to pay full wages and pensions. From 50 to 100million surplus rural workers were adrift between the villages and the cities, many subsisting through part-time low-paying jobs. Popular resistance, changes in central policy, and loss of authority by rural cadres have weakened China's population control program.|$|E

25|$|In the pre-reform era, {{government}} {{was funded by}} profits from <b>state-owned</b> <b>enterprises,</b> much like the Soviet Union. As the state sector fell in importance and profitability, government revenues, especially that {{of the central government}} in Beijing, fell substantially and the government relied on a confused system of inventory taxes. Government revenues fell from 35% of GDP to 11% of GDP in the mid-1990s, excluding revenue from <b>state-owned</b> <b>enterprises,</b> with the central government's budget at just 3% of GDP. The tax system was reformed in 1994 when inventory taxes were unified into a single VAT of 17% on all manufacturing, repair, and assembly activities and an excise tax on 11 items, with the VAT becoming the main income source, accounting for half of government revenue. The 1994 reform also increased the central government's share of revenues, increasing it to 9% of GDP.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, the {{neoliberal}} reforms were implemented, {{although not all}} at once: {{by the end of}} 1990, the prices were liberalized and a free currency exchange rate, devaluing the leu by 60%.
