The parents, astounded by how awful the pageant has turned out, begin blaming one another for destroying Christmas and a fight breaks out. When Chef finds out where Kyle is, he reveals to the children that Mr. Hankey does actually exist. When all the children start believing, Mr. Hankey finally reveals himself to everyone and scolds them for losing sight {{of the good things}} of Christmas and focusing on the bad. The townspeople release Kyle from the asylum and apologize, then they all sing Christmas songs and watch Mr. Hankey fly away with Santa Claus. Cartman, Stan, and Kyle feel that <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>missing.</b> [...] "THE END" [...] then appears, and Kenny is excited and relieved that he has survived the entire episode without getting killed in spite of being involved in dangerous and life-threatening situations throughout.|$|E
40|$|A Postliberal view on {{the sermon}} Over the same period that homiletics has enjoyed a resurgence, {{mainline}} Protestant churches have been in decline. The multiplication of preaching theories and resources has taken place alongside a growing concern about the life and future of the church. Despite all the theories and resources many local pastors know something is lacking in their preaching. They've tried inductive preaching, story preaching, dialogue sermons, and homiletical plots. While these new methods have been exciting for the moment, many preachers sense <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>missing.</b> It will be argued that it {{is partly due to}} the absence of thorough theological reflection...|$|E
40|$|Although {{many studies}} have been {{published}} about inclusive education {{there is still a}} prevalent displeasure around the world with the inclusive capabilities of many schools and teachers. Despite the fact that teachers generally follow the rules suggested by the literature that lead to inclusion it seems that <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>missing.</b> In my opinion it is that teachers and schools fail to spot and pay attention to certain details and that this has a major effect on their efforts to provide equal participation in teaching and learning for all students. My argument in this paper is that if we pay attention to and consider those particular details it may help us to provide more inclusive practice. Recent years have seen considerable efforts in many countries to ensure the right of all students to participate equally in teaching (e. g. UNESCO, 1994). Existing research focuses attention on some of the difficulties currently encountered within schools. For example, there are concerns about how to respond to students categorized as having behavioral difficulties (Angelides, 2000), or how to integrate students with disabilities into regular classrooms (e. g. Booth and Ainscow...|$|E

50|$|In 1975, {{after many}} years of slow decay and decline, Baltimore was {{struggling}} to reinvent itself as the center of business and commerce that the city had been previously. The old piers around the Inner Harbor had been cleared and a Promenade built around the water's edge. Citizens were beginning to discover that the harbor could become a magnet for people and recreation, as it had once been a magnet for shipping and trade. But <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>missing</b> - a symbol, a trademark, an icon to link Baltimore to its harbor.|$|R

40|$|From {{the amount}} of {{literature}} and research that is coming out, {{it is clear that}} leadership will once again emerge as one of the pivotal areas in the coming years. During the 90 ´s we were mainly focusing on process management, re-engineering, company culture, quality and organizational learning. After having implemented all of those, it has come to our notice that <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>missing,</b> because the organization is still far from functioning properly. Many a time the missing link is true leadership. There seems to be a lack of intelligent leaders, who are able to create and sustain an inspiring vision and implement the vision together with their teams. That is the reason why I´m trying here to find answers to the following kind of questions: What is leadership? How has leadership changed during the last twenty years? What are the most crucial elements in leadership? How can we develop leaders for the future? How we ourselves could become better leaders? The {{purpose of this article is}} to find new intelligent answers for this kind of questions. Or even more: to find new questions concerning leadership. I have myself been interested in leadership and studied it in theory and practice for more than twenty years. I have tried to follow the development of the management and leadership theory and have worked in many international organizations as a developer of leaders and managers durin...|$|E
40|$|We {{live in a}} {{world that}} is broken by sin, where the only {{permanent}} thing is change. The cause of man’s sin was that the koinonia relationship between man and God had been severed. After Adam and Eve feel into sin, a spiritual darkness in the history of man began. Man was unable to rebuild the communication and relationship that he had with God. God came through the calling of Abram (Abraham) to restore some of the koinonia relationship we need. In the New Testament, Jesus came and restored the way to God, but <b>something</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>missing.</b> This koinonia relationship will only be totally fulfilled when Jesus comes again to take us home. God’s instrument to experience true koinonia is the church. The koinonia that was lost and restored in Jesus. The church of today has lost some of the koinonia that the first church experienced, by becoming program orientated. The church is at this moment in a transformation process, where it is rediscovering the importance of being a mission-minded balanced loving community that is experiencing koinonia in relationships. The small group is thé vehicle that could help the church rediscover the koinonia, which people and the world need. This will only become true when we have a broader insight of the small group ministry in a local missionary-minded community (congregation). The small groups ministry is not a tool to use. You start a small group ministry in your local congregation because this is the way you were created. To truly understand the local church and the way we were created, we need to look back. We need to look back to creation, and how God created us, and to remind us of the Triune God’s, Father, Son and Spirit’s functioning in community. Only when the church realizes again that we are created in God’s image, will we look at our mission responsibilities and not-yet-believers in a new way. Namely, God’s way.

40|$|As many {{institutions}} have begun participating in open access and creating institutional repositories {{it has become}} evident that some type of catalyst is necessary to initiate participation from the faculty. The mantra of “build it they will come” that some scholarly communication librarians and repository managers held has not carried over to faculty-initiated deposits to institutional repositories. Whether it was {{from a lack of}} knowledge, time, or energy, they hadn’t come; <b>something</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>missing</b> from the repository service model holding faculty back from fully participating with their institutional repository. What faculty needed and wanted was a repository service model that would assist them through the process of rights checking, version control, and the eventual submission to the institutional repository. In the beginning of 2013 the Purdue Libraries began meeting with faculty and academic departments to discuss open access and participation with the Purdue e-Pubs institutional repository. Since April of 2013 the Purdue e-Pubs repository has offered faculty the opportunity to make their publications openly available through an initial curriculum vitae review and deposit-by-proxy deposit model by repository staff. This presentation will discuss the workflows, project management, communication schedule, and numerous resources and documentation that have been created and adopted by the Purdue e-Pubs repository to offer Purdue faculty the necessary catalyst to initiate open access participation. This session will also discuss several cases where these new services have led to blanket participation by departments, as well as cases where faculty initiated the deposit of their more recent scholarship that fell beyond the scope of their initial curriculum vitae review...|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{aspect of}} robot-environment interaction in industrial environments {{is given by}} the capability of the control system to model the structured and unstructured environment features. Industrial robots have to perform complex tasks at high speeds and have to satisfy hard cycle times while maintaining the operations extremely precise. The capability of the robot to perceive the presence of environmental objects <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>still</b> <b>missing</b> in the real industrial context. Although anthropomorphic robot producers have faced problems related to the interaction between robot and its environment, {{there is not an}} exhaustive study on the capabilities of the robot being aware of its volume and on the tools eventually mounted on its flange. In this paper, a solution to model the environment of the robot {{in order to make it}} capable of perceiving and avoiding collisions with the objects in its surroundings is shown. Furthermore, the model will be extended to take also into account the volume of the robot tool in order to extend the perception capabilities of the entire system. Testing results will be showed in order to validate the method, proving that the system is able to cope with complex real surroundings...|$|R
