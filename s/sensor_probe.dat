40|$|The {{presented}} thesis {{deals with}} the enhancement {{of the use of}} mobile security and surveillance robots. By using autonomous <b>sensor</b> <b>probes</b> the simultaneously covered area respective borderline by security and surveillance robots can be increased significantly. This system includes <b>sensor</b> <b>probes,</b> deployment unit, which enables a security robot to place and recollect <b>sensor</b> <b>probes,</b> as well as algorithms to identify the best positions for the <b>sensor</b> <b>probes</b> depending on the use case. For the <b>sensor</b> <b>probes</b> an interface was invented that enables the deployment units both to compensate a potential offset in horizontal direction when recollecting the probes and to correct a potential rotation without the use of additional sensors or actors. Furthermore, commercially available components for the equipment of the <b>sensor</b> <b>probes</b> have been analyzed. For the deployment units an efficient concept for storage and handling of <b>sensor</b> <b>probes,</b> which reduces the use of sensors and actors to a minimum and manages probe handling with only one degree of freedom, was invented. In order to control the deployment units by the surveillance robot a controller has been developed which communicates over Ethernet. For the efficient placement of the probes two methods, Genetic algorithm and grid map with Greedy algorithm, have been chosen and adapted to the problem. With a specially developed simulation environment the parameters of both methods have been optimized and the results have been compared. In order to quantify the added value for security and surveillance robots by the use of <b>sensor</b> <b>probes</b> the value of average coverage was introduced. The comparison of the use of security and surveillance robots alone and in combination with <b>sensor</b> <b>probes</b> verified an enhancement by factors 4, 3 to 7, 5. Consequently an efficient extension for mobile security and surveillance robots has been developed, which significantly increases the surveillance performance...|$|R

5000|$|A metal {{detector}} is an electronic instrument which detects {{the presence of}} metal nearby. Metal detectors are useful for finding metal inclusions hidden within objects, or metal objects buried underground.

When a temperature variation is detected the probe sends an electrical signal to the control box, which consists of an electrical circuit board that then activates or deactivates the burner system. This control system can respond almost instantly to temperature changes on the griddle surface, which provides a far superior temperature control response to the fluid filled capillary bulb found in Modulating and Snap Action thermostats.

A continuous-wave Doppler radar antenna was mounted by the engine heat shield on the bottom surface, to send altitude and rate of descent data to the guidance system and pilot display during the landing.
