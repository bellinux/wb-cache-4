25|$|Royalties for {{nystatin}} totaled $13.4 million. As Brown and Hazen did {{not want}} any of the money for themselves, the philanthropic Research Corporation used half for grants to further scientific research {{and the other half}} to <b>support</b> <b>what</b> became known as the Brown-Hazen Fund.|$|E
25|$|The Wolfpak’s {{territorial}} enforcement {{has drawn}} attention {{because of its}} violent means. In an incident where a tourist cut off a friend of Alexander’s in a dangerous six-foot swell, the Wolfpak leader assaulted the tourist. Comments from anonymous locals show {{that the presence of}} Wolfpak is well perceived, if not intimidating. Some locals who hold similar values of cultural respect <b>support</b> <b>what</b> the members are trying to do.|$|E

25|$|The film {{makes his}} son a key theme, {{but in the}} book, Harrer does not mention his wife or son. He had in fact been married and divorced, as the film shows, but his ex-wife's new husband {{was killed in the}} war and Harrer's son was raised by his ex-wife's mother. In his autobiography, Harrer gives details of his contact with his son, but nothing to <b>support</b> <b>what</b> the film shows. In the book, Harrer says there was little to tie him to home as {{one of the reasons for}} staying in Tibet and not {{returning}} to Europe.|$|E
25|$|When WVFT {{became a}} {{conventional}} independent, it seemingly filled a void left when WJPR (channel 21, now WWCW) joined Fox at its inception on October 6, 1986. However, the fledgling network would not air a full week's worth of programming until September 1993, so WVFT was still programmed as an independent. The Roanoke/Lynchburg market was not large enough {{at the time}} to <b>support</b> <b>what</b> were essentially two independent stations, and both channels 21 and 27 suffered from the tight competition between one another. However, by 1990, WVFT's financial problems were more pronounced; the station suffered from declining viewership and was unable to pay for the rights to acquire stronger syndicated programming.|$|E
25|$|Allied armies {{began using}} {{combined}} arms formations and deep penetration strategies that Germany had {{used in the}} opening years of the war. Many Allied operations in the Western Desert and on the Eastern Front, relied on firepower to establish breakthroughs by fast-moving armoured units. These artillery-based tactics were also decisive in Western Front operations after Operation Overlord and the British Commonwealth and American armies developed flexible and powerful systems for using artillery <b>support.</b> <b>What</b> the Soviets lacked in flexibility, they made up for in number of rocket launchers, guns and mortars. The Germans never achieved the kind of fire concentrations their enemies were capable of by 1944.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2013, McLeroy {{returned}} to Austin to speak before the board {{he had once}} chaired to renew his objections to evolution and to support a series of science textbooks being considered for adoption. [...] "What {{we see in the}} world around us <b>supports</b> <b>what</b> the Bible says, but what we see in these books <b>supports</b> <b>what</b> the Bible says too," [...] said McLeroy, who contends that the books under consideration will permit the students to see for themselves the weakness of the evolutionary evidence.|$|R

25|$|Bau led one of 3 {{competing}} Traditionalist Tarragona factions, {{namely the}} one opposing Carloctavistas and javieristas and promoting rapprochement with the Alfonsist claimant, Don Juan. The Tortosa javierista Carlists distributed leaflets presenting him as Francoist traitor who ignored {{the lot of}} requetés detained by the Francoist administration. He apparently acknowledged that a future kingdom must encompass Francoist structures. His private papers from mid-1950s suggest that Bau, though with hesitation, tended to <b>support</b> <b>what</b> seemed a long-distance Franco’s plan for crowning prince Juan Carlos. However, when in 1957 he joined the Carlists who abandoned the regent-claimant Don Javier, Bau declared Juan Carlos’ father, Don Juan, the legitimate heir and continued to approach him as a king.|$|E
25|$|On May 3, 1880, the City’s {{board of}} {{trustees}} (now city council) passed an ordinance to organize the first fire department, which was originally a hook and ladder company. The ordinance also authorized the digging of a well in the public square, and the department soon acquired a horse-drawn ladder truck for $1,600. The foreman of the Hook & Ladder Company requested the city council provide additional equipment in January 1894. Items requested included lanterns, a heavy iron hook, and axes with hooks on the pole, which was {{to add to the}} existing equipment that included the ladder truck and several hose carts. The city purchased a hand engine from Albany, Oregon, in 1890 for $400. In 1894, the Hillsboro Coffee Club organized to <b>support</b> <b>what</b> was then a volunteer fire department.|$|E
500|$|Taylor {{opened his}} {{campaign}} on August 22 in London, a Republican stronghold in eastern Kentucky. Among his supporters were Senator Deboe, Congressman Samuel Pugh, Caleb Powers, and former Republican gubernatorial candidate Thomas Z. Morrow (who {{was also the}} brother-in-law of Governor Bradley). Taylor stressed the economic prosperity brought about during the McKinley administration. He reminded the crowd that the Republicans had not supported the enslavement of blacks and stated they would not now <b>support</b> <b>what</b> he called the [...] "political enslavement" [...] that would result from electing Goebel.|$|E

500|$|The mine {{comprises}} nineteen stories, {{of which}} eleven are below ground. From the entrance, the mine extends about 730 meters (2440ft) into the mountains, {{and the total}} length of its tunnels is about 40km (25 miles). Quarrying is done using the room and pillar method, mining {{only half of the}} salt and leaving the remaining half to <b>support</b> <b>what</b> is above.

500|$|Ken Hanly {{wrote that}} the {{political}} violence in Egypt [...] "will no doubt overshadow whatever repressive measures are taken against protests in Bahrain". Ala'a Shehabi wrote in the Foreign Policy that the choice of Independence Day by Tamarod should be understood {{as an attempt to}} gain true full sovereignty as opposed to Stephen D. Krasner's Organized Hypocrisy (1999): [...] "the paradox that though there is an informal understanding that states are sovereign, they can still be subject to constant intervention". Jane Kinninmont of Chatham House said Tamarod protests would not succeed to replicate the Egyptian scenario [...] "because the army in Bahrain doesn't play the same role, and many of the security services don’t include Shi'ite Bahrainis, so you don’t get that same sense of solidarity". Matar Matar of Al Wefaq said that even if thousands had participated in Tamarod protests, the situation would remain the same as long as the United States continued to <b>support</b> <b>what</b> he called an [...] "authoritarian regime" [...] in Bahrain.|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Rollason joined BBC Sport {{and became}} the first female {{presenter}} of Grandstand, where her down-to-earth presenting style quickly made her popular with viewers, and earned her a regular presenting role on BBC Two's Sport on Friday, as well as a raft of other sporting programmes. Among her credits with the BBC are coverage of the Wimbledon Championships, the 1992 Summer Olympics from Barcelona and 1996 Summer Olympics from Atlanta, together with the 1994 Commonwealth Games, which were held in Victoria, British Columbia. She was an advocate of disability sports, and helped to alter its public and media perception with her coverage of the 1996 Summer Paralympics. Britain's Olympic team had been fairly unsuccessful at that year's Olympics, prompting Rollason to urge viewers and the media to <b>support</b> <b>what</b> she called the [...] "real" [...] Olympics. Jane Swan, General Secretary of the British Paralympic Association later described how Rollason's support for the event had helped to change its image. [...] "Until then, the Paralympics had been treated as documentary material, focusing mainly on disability. Helen made people realise that it was sport." [...] Other disability sporting events she covered include the 1990 World Disabled Championships, 1991 Blind Golfers' Championships, and the 1992 Summer Paralympics. She also fronted sports bulletins for BBC Breakfast News. In 1996, she was named as the Television and Radio Industries Sports Presenter of the Year.|$|E

500|$|Davis proved, perhaps, to be {{the most}} pivotal instrumentalist during these sessions. [...] "If you listen to the album, every tune is led by Richard and {{everybody}} followed Richard and Van's voice," [...] says Merenstein. [...] "I knew if I brought Richard in, he would put the bottom on to <b>support</b> <b>what</b> Van wanted to do vocally, or acoustically. Then you get Jay playing those beautiful counter-lines to Van." [...] Davis was not impressed by Morrison, but not out of disdain or any preconceived notions, but rather because Morrison's professional comportment generally did not meet Davis's expectations. [...] "No prep, no meeting," [...] recalls Davis. [...] "He was remote from us, 'cause he came in and went into a booth... And that's where he stayed, isolated in a booth. I don't think he ever introduced himself to us, nor we to him... And he seemed very shy..." [...] Drummer Connie Kay later told Rolling Stone that he approached Morrison and asked [...] "what he wanted me to play, and he said to play whatever I felt like playing. We more or less sat there and jammed." [...] Morrison's impression of the sessions was [...] "The songs came together very well in the studio. Some of the tracks were first takes. [...] the musicians were really together. Those type of guys play what you're gonna do before you do it, that's how good they are." [...] He told Ritchie Yorke that only two tracks recorded during the sessions did not make it to the album. [...] "One was about Jesse James and the other about trains. They were both just basic blues numbers. That's why they didn't fit in with the album." ...|$|E

2500|$|Foreign {{relations}} {{began to}} increase in importance under López, who retained Paraguay's traditional mistrust of the surrounding states, yet lacked Francia's diplomatic skills. Initially López feared an attack by the Buenos Aires dictator Rosas. With Brazilian encouragement, López dropped Francia's policy of neutrality and began meddling in Argentine politics. Using the slogan [...] "Independence or Death", López declared war against Rosas in 1845 to <b>support</b> <b>what</b> was ultimately an unsuccessful rebellion in the Argentine province of Corrientes. Although Britain and France prevented him from moving against Paraguay, Rosas established a trade embargo on Paraguayan goods.|$|E
2500|$|After {{a three-month}} investigation, the FAA {{formally}} released their results {{at a press}} conference held on March 5, 1987. Here Paul Steucke retracted earlier FAA suggestions that their controllers confirmed a UFO, and ascribed it to a [...] "split radar image" [...] which appeared with unfortunate timing. He clarified that [...] "the FAA [...] not have enough material to confirm that something was there", and though they were [...] "accepting the descriptions by the crew" [...] they were [...] "unable to <b>support</b> <b>what</b> they saw". The McGrath incident was revealed here amongst the ample set of documents supplied to the journalists.|$|E
