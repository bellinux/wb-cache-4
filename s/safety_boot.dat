40|$|The study {{assesses the}} {{effects of climate change}} on police {{operation}} in Delta state. To achieve this climate, data were extracted from the archives of the Nigerian Meteorological Agency and the Met Station of the Department of Geography Delta State University Abraka, and police operation data were collected from the archive of the police diary at the state police headquarter. The results showed an evidence of climate change in delta state with a rise of 3 ˚C in temperature, and decadal rainfall increase of 120 mm; 56 mm and 121 mm in three epochs (1975 - 1984, 1985 - 1994 and 1995 - 2014). The first and last decades are wetter than the second epoch. There is a general in-crease in annual Police and vigilant operations from 1975 to 2014 and their operations are signif-icantly dependent on increase in rainfall and rise in temperature. Thus increase in rainfall and rise in temperature bring corresponding reduction in police and local vigilante operations in the state. It therefore recommended that federal and state government should provide rain coat, <b>safety</b> <b>boot,</b> umbrella, good vehicles to police on duty; and police and vigilante should embark on regular patrol be it raining or sunny day. This is because crimes (breaking and entry, armed rob-bery etc.) increase when it is raining heavily...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Many {{kinds of}} {{footwear}} {{are used for}} various purposes in the workplace in Japan. Careful selection of footwear is needed to protect workers from coldness {{and to keep the}} performance of workers in cold workplace where employees have to work under - 20 ℃. On the other hand, safety boots with high heat conductivity from foot to outside are needed for the workers in hot environments. But thermal characteristics are not shown for each boots. We measured the thermal insulation values of various kinds of footwear by thermal foot manikin. Materials and methods We tested 14 kinds of Japanese protective footwear (Midori Safety) with a thin or a thick sock in climate chamber by thermal foot manikin having 8 zones. The footwear included cold protective boots(2), long rubber boots(1), safety boots(4), safety shoes(2), business shoes(1), work sneakers(1), anti-electrostatic aerated shoes (2) and sandals (1). The ambient temperature of climate chamber was 4. 6 ± 0. 5 ℃. The air velocity near boot was 0. 27 ± 0. 5 m/sec. The boots were placed on a copper/zinc alloy plate in the climate chamber. When upper parts of foot manikin were not covered by footwear, muffler was wound around the foot manikin to avoid the unnecessary heat dissipation from manikin. The manikin skin temperature of each zones were set at 34 ℃ on the control software. Each test was run for about 80 minutes to reach steady state. The data registered during the last 10 minutes on PC were used to calculate the thermal resistance. In boot toe to L Calf data were used, in shoe foot and ankle data were used. We conform to ISO 15831 about the test methods. When the thermal resistance of the second measurement was not within the 4 % difference of that of first, the third measurement was done. The temperatures on the sock at the toe tip, the mid-sole, the dorsal foot, the guard front were measured by thermocouples which were fixed by surgical tape. Results and discussion In boots, thermal insulation with thick sock was larger than that with thin sock by 0. 014 - 0. 0033 m 2 ℃/W. The cold protective boot which had the inner sock with thick sock had the largest insulation, which was about 0. 45 m 2 ℃/W. The other kind of cold protective boot was 0. 325 m 2 ℃/W. Though the thermal resistances of normal <b>safety</b> <b>boot</b> were the same values of 0. 26 - 0. 27 m 2 ℃/W, <b>safety</b> <b>boot</b> whose material was fibrous leather made by cutting outer layer from normal leather was relatively lower value. Common rubber boot made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was lowest, 0. 215 m 2 ℃/W. In shoes, the thermal insulation of work sneaker was 0. 28 m 2 ℃/W, which was larger than business shoe, aerated shoe and sandal. The larger the aeration the shoes had, the smaller the temperature insulation. Temperature on sock in toe tip was smaller in sandal and aerated shoe than non-aerated work sneaker...|$|E

40|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{study was conducted}} to determine the prevalence of compliance on personal protective equipments among 240 workers in three different divisions involving steel production division, direct reduction iron division and the mechanical division at a steel factory in Terengganu. A series of guided questionnaire were issued to all the workers in the three divisions to measure the prevalence of compliance to five types of personal protective equipments which consist of safety helmet, mask, eye-protective gear, ear-plugs and <b>safety</b> <b>boots.</b> The prevalence compliance to safety helmet, mask, eye protection gear; ear-plugs and <b>safety</b> <b>boots</b> was 67. 1 %, 35. 3 %, 32. 0 %, 41. 1 % and 99. 2 % respectively. There was a significant relationship (p< 0. 05) between the compliance to safety helmets with type of work being done and for ear-plugs, relationship with compliance were significantly associated with type of work done, duration of use and fit-testing. Findings of this study also supports the hypothesis that compliance was associated with unimpeded movement, unaffected productivity and unhindered work task (p< 0. 05). Age and tenure in service have no significant relationship with compliance. Knowledge on safety and health issues were shown to relate to compliance with safety helmets (p< 0. 01). It is suggested that the management embark on risk assessment programs to be able to explicitly determine the suitability of personal protective equipment being used in regards to type of work, specifications and comfort of workers. Management should also take a firm stand by developing a policy that supports compliance of personal protective equipments...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study investigates {{determinants}} of {{the probability that}} an individual onboard a ship of a given shipping line will be injured (given that the ship {{is not involved in}} an accident). A Probit regression statistical model is used to investigate such determinants when ships are in port and on given types of containerships. Probit estimation results suggest that an individual is less likely to be injured in port onboard a ship that is larger in size and underway, but more likely to be injured if involved in a fall. An individual is less likely to be injured onboard a containership with AMO union officers if it is larger in size and during the daytime.
