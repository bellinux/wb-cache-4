50|$|<b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> is {{a disease}} caused by the {{mosquito}} borne <b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus. <b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus is related to Japanese encephalitis virus {{and is a member}} of the Flaviviridae subgroup. This disease mainly affects the United States. Occasional cases have been reported from Canada and Mexico.|$|E
50|$|In the United States {{an average}} of 128 cases of <b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> are {{recorded}} annually. In temperate areas of the United States, <b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> cases occur primarily {{in the late summer}} or early fall. In the southern United States where the climate is milder <b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> can occur year-round.|$|E
50|$|Mosquitoes, {{primarily}} from the genus Culex, become infected by feeding on birds infected with the <b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus. Infected mosquitoes then transmit the <b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus to humans and animals during the feeding process. The <b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus grows both in the infected mosquito and the infected bird, but does not make either one sick. Only infected mosquitoes can transmit <b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus. Once a human has been infected with the virus it is not transmissible from that individual to other humans.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. House finches are {{competent}} hosts {{for both}} West Nile and St. <b>Louis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> viruses and frequently become infected during outbreaks. In the current study, House finches were infected initially with either West Nile or St. <b>Louis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> viruses and then challenged 6 weeks post infection with either homologous or heterologous viruses. Although mortality rates were high during initial infection with West Nile virus, prior infection with either virus prevented mortality upon challenge with West Nile virus. Prior infection with West Nile virus provided sterilizing immunity against both viruses, whereas prior infection with St. <b>Louis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus prevented viremia from St. <b>Louis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus, but only reduced West Nile virus viremia titers. Immunologic responses were measured by enzyme immunoassay and plaque reduction neutralization tests. Heterologous challenge with West Nile virus in birds previously infected with St. <b>Louis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus produced the greatest immunologic response, markedly boosting antibody levels against St. <b>Louis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus. Our data have broad implications for free-ranging avian serological diagnostics and possibly {{for the recent}} disappearance of St. <b>Louis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus from California.

40|$|An {{epidemic}} of St. <b>Louis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> in 1985 in Mesa County, Colorado, led to 17 cases, including one fatality. Risk {{was associated with}} advanced age and residence in Grand Junction, the county's principal city. A trend was observed toward higher risk in females. However, increased risk in females {{was not associated with}} higher infection rates (increased exposure). Capture enzyme immunoassays detected specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin A after infection. A serosurvey of Grand Junction residents disclosed an infection rate of 4. 0 %, indicating that 1, 123 epidemic St. <b>Louis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> infections may have occurred in the city. Evidence of previous St. <b>Louis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus infection was found in 11. 2 % of survey respondents who had neutralizing anti-body to the virus without specific IgM. The prevalence of St. <b>Louis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus antibody was similar to rates observed in serosurveys undertaken 30 years earlier, indicating that the level of endemic St. <b>Louis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> transmission in the city had not changed appreciably in that interval. arboviruses; encephalitis, St. Louis; central nervous system disease; enceph...|$|R

40|$|N-terminal {{amino acid}} {{sequences}} of structural proteins of three flaviviruses, yellow fever, St. <b>Louis</b> <b>encephalitis,</b> and dengue- 2 viruses, have been obtained. The glycoproteins {{of these three}} viruses are 52 - 60 % conserved in the region sequenced, depending upon which pair of viruses are compared, and 40 % of the amino acids are invariant in all three viruses. Thus, flaviviruses are closely related and have in all probability descended from a common ancestor. Furthermore, residues important in the secondary structure of proteins are conserved, suggesting that the overall conformation of the glycoproteins is the same in all three viruses while considerable variation in the primary sequence can be accommodated. The N-terminal regions of the nucleocapsid proteins of yellow fever and St. <b>Louis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> viruses show markedly less homology (25 %) and this region is highly basic with one-quarter (yellow fever) or one-third (St. <b>Louis</b> <b>encephalitis)</b> of the residues being lysine or arginine.

Its habit of feeding on both birds and humans gives it significant potential for transmission of zoonotic infections from birds to humans.

50|$|Large-scale genetic screens imply several mEMC {{subunits}} in modulating the pathogenicity of flaviviruses such as West Nile Virus (WNV), Zika Virus (ZV), Dengue Fever Virus (DFV), and Yellow Fever Virus (YFV). In particular, loss {{of several}} mEMC subunits (e.g. EMC2, EMC3) lead to inhibition of WNV-induced cell death. Interestingly, however, WNV was {{still able to}} infect and proliferate in cells lacking EMC subunits. The authors made a similar observation {{of the role of the}} mEMC in the cell-killing capacity of <b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> <b>Encephalitis</b> Virus.

40|$|<b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus, {{a member}} of the $aviviridae subgroup, is a culex mosquito-borne pathogen. Despite severe {{epidemic}} outbreaks on several occasions, not much progress has been made with regard to an epitope-based vaccine designed for <b>Saint</b> <b>Louis</b> <b>encephalitis</b> virus. Covalent binding is an important mechanism for many drugs to gain its function. Computational algorithms to model this chemical event and extended it to a web server have been previously generated. The CovalentDock Cloud provides a simple yet user-friendly web interface to perform covalent docking experiments and analysis online. The web server accepts the structures of both the ligand and the receptor uploaded by the user or retrieved from online databases with valid access id. It identifies the potential covalent binding patterns, carries out the covalent docking experiments and provides visualization of the result for user analysis.
