40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{processes}} associated with receiving and sending postal items of E.

The aim is to develop the project "Electronic Registry", which can be implemented into current information systems of the company and which will contribute to the optimization of processes of the registry. To achieve this objective it was developed an extensive analysis of the current <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>registry</b> and records management system in E. ON Czech Republic. Based on analysis it was proposed a specific solution for improvement. The first part {{deals with the}} analysis of current legislative requirements and theoretical analysis of the document lifecycle, which is demonstrated on the example of E. ON Czech Republic {{in the second part of}} the thesis. In the second part there is the introduction of company E. ON Czech Republic, which is followed by description of the current <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>registry</b> and processes in relation to the rece-iving of postal items. In the analysis of the current situation there are identified issues that arise when receiving and processing postal items to the registry. To the identified problems are offered individual solutions, which are elaborated in the overall solution in the final part of the thesis. The last part is a custom suggestion of optimization of existing processes by using of digi-tizing paper documents and data mining for automatic sorting, which helps to streamline existing processes. This section describes specific solution that is introduced into the E. ON Czech Republic.
