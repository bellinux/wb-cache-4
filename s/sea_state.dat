5|$|The NTSB {{investigation}} {{noted that}} Great Lakes cargo vessels could normally avoid severe storms, {{and called for}} the establishment of a limiting <b>sea</b> <b>state</b> applicable to Great Lakes bulk cargo vessels. This would restrict the operation of vessels in sea states above the limiting value. One concern was that shipping companies pressured the captains to deliver cargo as quickly and cheaply as possible regardless of bad weather. At the time of Fitzgeralds foundering, there was no evidence that any governmental regulatory agency tried to control vessel movement in foul weather despite the historical record that hundreds of Great Lakes vessels had been wrecked in storms. The USCG took the position that only the captain could decide when it was safe to sail.|$|E
5|$|The Mk 41 Stable Vertical (also called Gun Director) was a {{vertical}} seeking gyroscope. Its function {{was to establish}} and maintain a stable earth vertical with its associated horizontal plane. With the horizontal plane established, the Mk 41 continuously measured the angles between the deck and the horizontal plane. These deck angles were continuously transmitted to the Rangekeeper so that it could keep the guns correctly elevated as the ship rolled and pitched. Mounted waist high on its side were the battery's firing keys. (see picture) The left key was the Salvo Signal Key, and it sounded the Salvo Buzzer in each of the turrets to warn the gun crews that the guns were about to fire. The center key (with bumps on its handle for tactile identification) was the Automatic Firing Key. When this key was held closed, the Mk 41 was enabled to automatically fire the guns whenever the ship's deck was parallel the horizontal plane. Also, if the <b>sea</b> <b>state</b> was such that the turrets' elevation power drives could not keep up with the ship's motion, the guns could be held at a fixed elevation, and the MK 41 could again automatically fire the guns as described. The right key was the Hand Firing Key. It bypassed the Mk 41, and fired the guns directly.|$|E
5|$|At 3:00 AM on October 15, the {{reinforced}} company (less one platoon) {{began moving}} out of Port Said in preparation for its landing. At 3:30, the fire preparation began against the fort. It {{was carried out by}} the 135th Brigade's artillery and an additional artillery battalion. At 4:00, the attack began. The secondary attack force approaching from the west opened fire to draw the garrison's attention. The main force advanced towards the fort, spearheaded by the Sa'iqa company. The Egyptians managed to reach the fort and surprise its garrison. Soon the company {{was on the verge of}} entering the fort. The naval force however, due to bad sea conditions (<b>sea</b> <b>state</b> 4) arrived at 4:30, half an hour late, and then was forced to land one kilometer west of the fort. It joined the secondary attack group in its advance against the fortification. The mixed force came under heavy fire, and the battalion commander, Ali al-Mezahi was killed. The Sa'iqa company east of the fort finally succeeded in breaching the fort's defenses under heavy fire; the company commander was hit several times but continued to lead his men. The secondary force also managed to reach the fort's northern sand embankment. The fighting became intense, and the Egyptians picked up a radio signal sent by the garrison commander in which he detailed his men's precarious position and requested immediate assistance, especially air support. Despite the initial success achieved, Salah did not have his reserves on either side of the fort join the attack. With sunrise, Israeli aircraft began attacking Egyptian troops. Two F-4 Phantoms strafed the secondary force and made several bombing runs against it, while helicopters attacked the main force.|$|E

40|$|Establishing {{statistical}} {{distributions of}} the response extremes is of particular importance {{for the design of}} FPSO mooring systems and the related riser design. Long term time domain simulation is the most accurate design approach to determine the extreme responses. It involves, however, coupled dynamic analysis of FPSO mooring system for a large number of <b>sea</b> <b>states</b> and consequently the task is often prohibitively time consuming. To solve this problem, an approach for the long term extreme analysis based on a metamodel in conjunction with the design of experiment methodology is proposed in the paper. In this approach, Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) based on the design of experiment method, is performed to select a sub-set of <b>sea</b> <b>states</b> from all <b>sea</b> <b>states.</b> Short term distributions for this sub-set of <b>sea</b> <b>states</b> are simulated and estimated. Kriging metamodel, which can map the relations between the <b>sea</b> <b>states</b> characteristics and the short term distribution parameters, is then applied. The accuracy of the metamodel is investigated. The long term response distribution of moored FPSO systems for all <b>sea</b> <b>states</b> can be predicted based on the metamodel. This approach for the long term extreme analysis of FPSO mooring systems avoids the response analysis over all <b>sea</b> <b>states</b> and can greatly improve the computational efficiency of the long term extreme analysis of FPSO mooring systems...|$|R

Compared {{to the basic}} model, the vehicle design features changes increasing floatability and vehicle stability: the self-entrenching equipment is omitted, a lightweight anti-surge vane and an air intake tube are introduced; the BMP-3F turret is also protected by anti-surge vanes. Water jet propellers develop a speed of 10km/h when afloat. The BMP-3F design allows the vehicle to come ashore under rough sea conditions and to tow the same-type vehicle. A new main sight, the SOZH, which has an integrated laser range finder and an ATGM guidance channel, is installed. This version can endure continuous amphibious operation for seven hours with the running engine.|$|E

25|$|In oceanography, rogue {{waves are}} more {{precisely}} defined as waves whose height {{is more than}} twice the significant wave height (Hs or SWH), which is itself defined as the mean of the largest third of waves in a wave record. Therefore, rogue waves are not necessarily the biggest waves found on the water; they are, rather, unusually large waves for a given <b>sea</b> <b>state.</b> Rogue waves seem not to have a single distinct cause, but occur where physical factors such as high winds and strong currents cause waves to merge to create a single exceptionally large wave.|$|E

40|$|A set of metocean {{contour lines}} {{corresponding}} to annual exceedance probabilities of 10 ^(- 2) and 10 ^(- 4) describing the environmental {{conditions at the}} Ekofisk area are established based on hindcast data. These are divided into different propagation directions as the total sea is composed of considerable waves from north, south and west. For the sake of measuring extreme responses of a slender pile structure, critical <b>sea</b> <b>states</b> selected from these contour lines are subjected for model testing. Wavetrains designed to break at {{the exact location of}} the pile are generated in order to investigate the importance of breaking waves relative to the extreme pile responses. A comprehensive investigation of the experimental setup is performed to ensure reliable model test results. Model tests of critical <b>sea</b> <b>states</b> based on both the JONSWAP wave spectrum and the Donelan wave spectrum are performed for comparable reasons. The Donelan spectrum pro- vides larger crest heights and more severe pile responses than the JONSWAP spectrum for steep <b>sea</b> <b>states.</b> For less steep <b>sea</b> <b>states</b> the opposite trend is seen. Hence, the Donelan spectrum is concluded to be most suitable for steep <b>sea</b> <b>states</b> and the JONSWAP spectrum for less steep <b>sea</b> <b>states</b> in order to obtain the most severe responses. The critical <b>sea</b> <b>states</b> subjected for model testing are found to consist of smaller wave heights than desired partly due to mechanical losses in the wave maker. This may have led to an underprediction of the characteristic pile responses. In order to account for this in a future extension of this experiment, a correction term amplifying the wave maker motion should be introduced. Based on the findings from this model test experiment, breaking waves are considered important for global design of the slender pile structure located south in the North Sea. In addition, tremendous impact forces exerted by plunging breakers may lead to local damage of the pile, which in worst case can harm its overall structural strength...|$|R

40|$|The {{frequency}} of occurrence of combined wave systems like wind sea and swell may increase in some ocean areas due to the observed change of storm tracks.
