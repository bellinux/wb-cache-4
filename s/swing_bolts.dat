50|$|At the Mission Management Team meeting, {{managers}} cleared Discovery's {{heat shield}} for reentry, and verified that focused inspection was not required, but noted that late inspection {{will still be}} performed on flight day 13 following undocking. John Shannon mentioned that managers have decided to add a task to the second EVA, asking the astronauts to visually inspect the Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ) on the starboard side, as the joint has registered some vibration {{for the past month}} and a half. While the friction is not constant or severe, managers will have Tani remove the insulation covers from the joint to photograph the <b>swing</b> <b>bolts</b> on the joint since Tani would be near the area during the EVA.|$|E
5|$|The first {{sport to}} {{interest}} Bolt was cricket, {{and he said}} {{if he was not}} a sprinter, he would be a fast bowler instead. As a child, he was a supporter of the Pakistani cricket team and admired the bowling of Waqar Younis. He is also a fan of Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar, West Indian opener Chris Gayle, and Australian opener Matthew Hayden. During a charity cricket match, Bolt clean-bowled Gayle who was complimentary of <b>Bolt's</b> pace and <b>swing.</b> <b>Bolt</b> also struck a six off Gayle's bowling. Another bowler complimentary of Bolt's pace was former West Indies fast-bowling great Curtly Ambrose.|$|R
50|$|The bow {{caps and}} {{shutters}} are mechanically {{linked to a}} hydraulically operated drive rod from within the torpedo compartment. The bow cap opens first behind the shutter, which then folds back against it forming a smooth exit tube. Interlocks prevent the doors at both ends being opened {{at the same time}} but the inner door is also provided with a test cock to check whether the tube is full of water before opening and remains held nearly closed by the <b>swing</b> <b>bolt</b> after the locking ring is released. The tube internal diameter is 22.5 in, wider than the torpedo, which is designed as a loose fit inside the tube. Torpedoes could be fired either electrically or with compressed air.|$|R
50|$|The forward torpedo {{tubes are}} {{constructed}} in two sections bolted together across the bulkhead at the fore {{end of the}} torpedo compartment. The 116-in long inner section is constructed of 0.5-in rolled steel fitted with welded flanges and support brackets. The outer section is constructed of a similar tube 175 in long but with a reinforced 1.125 inch thick section behind the main bulkhead. The internal door hinges at one side with two locking mechanisms, a <b>swing</b> <b>bolt</b> opposite the hinge and a rotating locking ring attached to the tube which presses down on the ten projecting lugs around the door. The outer end of the tube is sealed with a domed bow cap. Bow shutters close across the bow caps so as to preserve the streamlined shape of the bow when the cap is closed.|$|R
50|$|While {{most other}} {{manufacturers}} derive their trucks from road applications, Tatra T815 was purposely designed for extreme off-road conditions, and its road versions {{are derived from}} the off-road original concept. The principle consists in a central load-carrying tube with independently suspended <b>swinging</b> half-axles <b>bolted</b> as one whole. This gives Tatra vehicles outstanding driving qualities in the most difficult terrains. The concept allows higher off-road speed compared to classical rigid axle design.|$|R
6000|$|Before this Jacob {{had come}} forward {{publicly}} {{in proportion to}} his financial importance in the community. He first commended himself to the Better Element by crushing out a strike in his Buggy Works, which were now the largest business interest of the place; and he rose on a wave of municipal reform to such a height of favor with the respectable classes that he was elected on a citizens' ticket to the Legislature. In the reaction which followed he was barely defeated for Congress, and was talked of as a dark horse who might be put up for the governorship some day; but {{those who knew him}} best predicted that he would not get far in politics, where his bull-headed business ways would bring him to ruin sooner or later; they said, [...] "You can't <b>swing</b> a <b>bolt</b> like you can a strike." ...|$|R
50|$|Two of {{the pedals}} {{on the right}} are the brakes. The left brake pedal stops the left rear wheel and the right brake pedal does {{the same with the}} right side. This {{independent}} left and right wheel-braking augments the steering of the tractor when only the two rear wheels are driven. This is usually done when it is necessary to make a sharp turn. The split brake pedal is also used in mud or soft soil to control a tire spinning due to loss of traction. The operator presses both pedals together to stop the tractor. Usually a <b>swinging</b> or sliding <b>bolt</b> is provided to lock the two together when desired.|$|R
5000|$|The entire summit {{including}} the Doover pad is encircled by {{remnants of a}} 9-10 strand wire/barbed wire fence strung on bush poles (local adaptation) and semi-flanked on the western, northern and eastern sides by small [...] "sentry posts" [...] constructed from local rocks. A short <b>swing</b> arm is <b>bolted</b> {{near the top of}} some of the bush poles. The strategically placed [...] "sentry posts" [...] offer good vantage points to the country below. They are typically a crescent shaped arrangement of rocks piled to create a low protective barrier. Three iron stay poles are affixed to the ground at separate points some distance from the Doover. The cement base in which one stay is embedded is inscribed with the initials FWG, RCR, ECL and the date 6.5.43.|$|R
