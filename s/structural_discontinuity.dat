It forms as a response to inhomogeneous deformation partitioning strain into planar or curviplanar high-strain zones. Intervening (crustal) blocks stay relatively unaffected by the deformation. Due to the shearing motion of the surrounding more rigid medium, a rotational, non co-axial component can be induced in the shear zone. Because the discontinuity surface usually passes through a wide depth-range, a great variety of different rock types with their characteristic structures are produced.|$|E

[...] Once a tread separation begins it can grow along the circumference of the tire or laterally across the width of the tire leading to cracks that grow between the belts. As separation progressed it could grow to form large crescent shaped areas along one or both sides of the tire. If those areas grew large enough they could separate catastrophically, especially at high speeds where the separation was aided by the centrifugal force of the spinning tire.|$|E

40|$|A {{discussion}} of and introduction to satellite-altitude geopotential field studies and their interpretation {{with emphasis on}} results from metalliferous regions will be given. The magnetic and gravimetric measurements from satellite altitudes show heterogeneity in deeper parts of the lithosphere. These patterns of magnetic anomalies do not only reveal the largest iron ore deposits such as Kiruna, Sweden, Kursk, Russia, and Banugi, Central African Republic but also linear features indicating <b>structural</b> <b>discontinuities.</b> Changes of magnetic amplitude of these patterns are caused by intersecting transverse fractures localizing magmatism and concentration of metals. In addition satellite altitude data are related to variations in crustal thickness and heat flow. Deep-rooted <b>structural</b> <b>discontinuities,</b> defined by combination of geological and geophysical criteria, with spacing of several hundred kilometers, reveal a quite uniform pattern in the deeper parts of the lithosphere. As these structures provide favorable pathways for the ascent of heat, magmas and ore-forming fluids, their recognition is of crucial importance {{and can be used}} in the compilation of a new type of mineral prognosis map.

The methodology involves (a) regionalization of point observations of orientations (azimuth and dip) of <b>structural</b> <b>discontinuities</b> in rocks in order to generate a digital structural model (DStM), (b) testing the kinematical possibility of specifi c modes of rock slope failures by integrating DStMs and digital elevation model (DEM) -derived slope and aspect data and (c) computation of stability scenarios with respect to identified rock slope failure modes. We tested the methodology {{in an area of}} 90 km² in Darjeeling Himalaya (India) and in a small portion (9 km²) within this area with higher density of field structural orientation data. The results of the study show better classification of rock slope instability in the smaller area with respect to known occurrences of deep-seated rockslides than with respect to shallow translational rockslides, implying that structural control is more important for deep-seated rockslides than for shallow translational rockslides. Results of scenario-based analysis show that, in rock slopes classified to be unstable, stress-induced rock slope instability tends to increase with increasing level of water saturation.

Some welded structure details about cope holes to avoid weld cross appear during the design and construction stage.

These fatigue cracks are always initiated at the weld toe of the flange for these details, where high local stress concentration is induced by the <b>structural</b> <b>discontinuity</b> or weld defections. Thus, fatigue assessment and analysis of these welded details are necessary for bridges under repeated cyclic loads [1].|$|E

Usually in airborne gravity surveys magnetic data are collected as well. Although the magnetic data acquired during gravity surveys generally have lower spectral and spatial resolution than standard high-resolution aeromagnetic (HRAM) data, they add significant value to {{the interpretation of the}} acquired gravity data. In many cases, the gravity and magnetic data are responding to the same geological source. For example, <b>structural</b> <b>discontinuities</b> such as faults, fractures and geological contacts can create lateral contrasts in density and magnetization of rocks. These contrasts often generate gravity and magnetic signatures. However, due to density and magnetic variations of the rocks these <b>structural</b> <b>discontinuities</b> are partly detected on the gravity image and partly on the magnetic image. Therefore, we think that if we combine the two images together in a single image and use it to detect lineaments, then we may see trends related to structural control more clearly.

Etna region. Along this area, major NE-SW trending Mio-Pliocene compressive structures (thrust-top basins and related syncline) are systematically dragged and rotated according to vertical axis until to assume a hook-shape at their terminations. The clockwise sense of rotation of such major structures suggests the occurrence of regional, more than 100 km long, dextral wrench fault zone with a NW-SE direction. More detailed field surveys performed in key sectors (e. g. Madonie Mts. and Mt. Judica region) reveal that this crustal discontinuity consists probably of a wider deformation band that in the near-surface scattered {{into a series of}} discrete segments which sometimes overlap to form zone of releasing/restraining stopovers. The analysis of the seismicity of the studied region helped us to achieve further information about the characteristics of this shear zone. Selected earthquakes (from the CSI 1. 1 1981 – 2002 by Castello et al., 2006, and from Bollettino Sismico 2003 - 2012, [URL] were used as data source for a simultaneous inversion of a 3 -D velocity structure and hypocentre parameters. The obtained velocity images and the foci distribution depict a relevant NW-SE oriented tectonic boundary. This structural element splits a sector of high concentration of earthquakes northwards from a zone with relative paucity of seismicity southward. Further, the possible presence of this major <b>structural</b> <b>discontinuity</b> is emphasized by a strong wave velocity contrast found in central Sicily and visible down to about 30 km of depth...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part F: Journal of Rail and Rapid Transit and the definitive published version is available at [URL] paper aims to investigate alternative ways of reducing the deterioration and failure of railway track insulated rail joints (IRJs). Joints deteriorate faster than rail initially due to the <b>structural</b> <b>discontinuity</b> present. This weakness results in both extra displacement {{as a consequence of}} applied load and the dynamic force that results as a consequence. Over time this situation worsens as the impacts and applied stresses both damage and soften the ballast and supporting subgrade under the joint. This study initially presents a static finite element model designed to simulate the mechanics of IRJs and a comparison between plain rail and a suspended insulated rail joint under various support stiffnesses. Product design options of reinforced IRJs are then chosen as input variables of the model. Results of the model are compared with field and laboratory data acquired via the Video Gauge, which is a new high-resolution optical measurement technique. Results show that the use of strap rails or more robust I-beam sections {{in the vicinity of the}} IRJ to stiffen the support structure can significantly reduce the displacement and the subsequent dip angle seen at an IRJ. This potentially presents a means of improving the IRJ behaviour. Their impact becomes more significant for soft support conditions. Although these results are indicative for new IRJ conditions, field measurements indicate that the magnitude of deflection of IRJs is a result of the <b>structural</b> <b>discontinuity</b> of the rail, the dynamic P 2 force, the wheel condition, the degraded ballast and it significantly increases with time under repeated load. Thus, it is recommended that careful field implementation and testing will indicate the effect of an external enhancement on the timely degradation of insulated rail joints...|$|E
