50|$|The SEMI Standards {{program was}} {{established}} in 1973 using proceeds from the west coast <b>SEMICON</b> show.

The standards would become internationally utilized over the years, through partnerships with the ASTM, the DIN, and other national standards organizations. Before these standards, there were more than two thousand different specifications for silicon and by 1975 80% of all silicon wafers met with the SEMI standard.

HVDC cables for higher voltage level, larger power capacity and higher reliability are still desired for the power industry as part of a global power strategy. One of the major concerns related to HVDC applications is the presence of space charge within the dielectrics, which distorts the electric field distribution and contributes to accelerated ageing and consequent failure of the cable insulation. The byproducts generated from the crosslinking process during the manufacture of XLPE insulation for HVDC cable {{are one of the}} major sources of hetero-charge formation in dielectrics.

Degassing effects and thermal ageing effects have also been studied with the spectroscopy techniques. Thermal-electric behaviour and maximum voltages for thermal breakdown have been theoretically simulated for the model cables. Three loss origins of the XLPE cables have been found with different loss mechanisms. Conduction loss due to thermally activated electron/hole hopping dominates the lower frequency range from 10 - 4 Hz to 1 Hz; <b>Semicon</b> loss due to its in series resistance with the insulation layer in cable equivalent circuit dominates the higher frequency range from 102 Hz to 104 Hz; intrinsic polarization loss of the XLPE insulation has dominant flat loss spectra in the mid-frequency range from 1 Hz to 102 Hz. Degassing was found to decrease the conductivity of the model cables, while thermal ageing greatly increased the conductivity. Thermal-electric simulation results with FEMLAB have shown that the position of maximum field changes from inner to outer insulation boundary under higher applied voltages.

40|$|Partial Discharge (PD), {{a partial}} {{breakdown}} of insulation between high voltage electrodes, reduces cable reliability. Understanding electromagnetic propagation of PD-induced pulses in shielded power cable, including attenuation and dispersion, {{is essential to}} the application of PD diagnostics and, especially, PD location. Dispersion is caused by the transition of cable semicon-ducting layers (between the cable conductors and dielectric) from 2 ̆ 2 resistive 2 ̆ 2 at low frequency to 2 ̆ 2 capacitive 2 ̆ 2 at high frequency. Methods are presented to compute dispersion as a function of semiconducting material properties and evaluate the effect of dispersion on pulse characteristics (amplitude, shape, and width, etc.) as a function of distance propagated, the results of which are applied to investigate the effects of dispersion for PD detection and location. The location error induced by dispersion can be compensated from calibration. ^ Electrochemical degradation of cable dielectrics, known as 2 ̆ 2 water treeing 2 ̆ 2, {{is one of the leading}} cause of premature failures in underground shielded power cable. Silane-based fluid has been used successfully for decades to rejuvenate HMWPE and XLPE dielectric cables to 2 ̆ 2 cure 2 ̆ 2 existing water trees and extend cable life. However the ability of the treatment to inhibit future water tree initiation is not known. A method for silane fluid treatment of un-aged cable insulation and <b>semicon</b> was developed based on the use of GC/MS to determine curing of the fluid within the dielectric. A wet electrical aging test at 5 kV/mm (127 V/mil) based on a sample which includes <b>semicon</b> electrodes on both sides of the XLPE insulation with a water electrode in contact with one <b>semicon</b> layer was used to age untreated samples, samples treated prior to the test, and samples treated at the mid-time of the test (3500 hrs).

The mechanism by which the silane-based fluid cures existing water trees and impedes the formation of future water trees is addressed. ^ To characterize polymeric capacitor film, a solid state, high voltage switch rated 8 kV with a turn-on time in the range of 100 ns and current capability from μA to kA was developed based on the use of two SCR 2 ̆ 7 s in series. The system is used to measure energy release from linear and nonlinear dielectrics as a function of discharge time constant.

40|$|Abstract—Theoretical {{analysis}} for different active layer struc-tures is performed {{to minimize the}} laser threshold current of the ultraviolet GaN/AlGaN multiple-quantum-well laser diodes by using advanced device simulation. The simulation {{results show that the}} lower threshold current can be obtained when the number of quantum wells is two or three and the aluminum composition in the barrier layer is about 10 %– 12 %. This result is attributed to several different effects including electron leakage current, nonuniform carrier distribution, interface charge den-sity induced by spontaneous and piezoelectric polarization, and optical confinement factor. These internal physical mechanisms are investigated by theoretical calculation to analyze the effects of quantum-well number and different aluminum compositions in barrier layer on laser threshold properties. Furthermore, the effect of quantum-well thickness is discussed as well.

40|$|A {{case study}} is a focused method used to inspect, analyze, and assess an {{individual}} or an institution placed in a unique situation. It allows researchers and students to review steps taken by an individual or organization and to understand the mechanics of how that individual or organization was affected {{by a number of}} factors both inherent and environmental. Case studies are special types of research presumed to contain valid, tested information about human behavior and processes. In conceiving, structuring, and writing cases, the writer should consider certain basic and conventional goals. These are described below with illustrations from various fields. Getting Started How well the setting is defined in a case study determines its effectiveness. This means that in writing a case study, the writer must provide enough detail across many levels in order to set the stage. At the same time, the individual subject or institution, or “the protagonist, ” must be clearly introduced and followed throughout the study. This step is the first {{and one of the most}} important. One key process to consider in beginning a case is the importance of identifying a protagonist.
