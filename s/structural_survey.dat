5|$|The Art Nouveau Chadderton Baths was {{a public}} {{swimming}} facility opened in 1937. Henry Taylor, the British Olympic freestyle swimming triple gold medallist and champion was an attendant at Chadderton Baths where many of his awards were displayed. Chadderton Baths were closed indefinitely in 2006 after a <b>structural</b> <b>survey</b> found faults which could have put the public at risk. Chadderton Sports Centre, built onto the Baths, was closed and replaced by the Chadderton Wellbeing Centre in January 2010. An application to demolish the Baths was made in March 2011, but is now in private ownership with conversion work due soon. The Wellbeing Centre is a multi-purpose facility with a swimming pool, dance studio, library, gym, meeting rooms, and café.|$|E
25|$|Between November 1996 and January 1997, on-site {{surveys were}} {{conducted}} by a project team consisting of Tennebaum-Manheim Engineers and Architectural Resources Group. Surveyors included architects, materials conservators, architectural historians, structural engineers, mechanical engineers, and electrical engineers. The architectural and materials condition survey included a close-range visual inspection {{of all of the}} wood members in the building to determine locations of deteriorated wood, an analysis of the types of wood species occurring in the building, a study of the building’s construction details, glazing, and a photographic survey. The <b>structural</b> <b>survey</b> included measuring the deflection of each of the arches and studying the probable lateral and vertical load paths to determine areas of weakness.|$|E
25|$|But {{despite these}} repairs, by 2002 the {{memorial}} still had almost $795,000 in deferred repairs. Some {{of the larger}} and more costly projects which were needed included removal and resetting of the granite front steps, purchase and installation of emergency generators, replacement of the fresh water mains, installation of a tuned mass damper to prevent wind damage to the tower, installation of emergency lighting, and a <b>structural</b> <b>survey</b> of the memorial. In 2003, the Northern and Southern Jurisdictions of Scottish Rite of Freemasonry agreed to provide $200,000 to fund the renovation of the George Washington museum. The renovations were {{to be completed by}} August 2003. In February 2004, renovations to the exhibits in the three Shriners' rooms on the first floor were also complete. By fall of that year, the sidewalks {{on the north side of}} the memorial had also been replaced, and in 2005 retaining walls around the Masonic symbol on the east side were built. Aircraft warning lights were installed atop the memorial in early 2006, and security lighting installed in the parking lots. But while welcome, these were not the major repairs the GWMNMA said it needed to make.|$|E

500|$|In {{response}} to the Hillsborough disaster which resulted in 96 fatalities, the Taylor Report of August 1989 recommended that all major grounds be converted to become all-seater as a safety measure. In mid-1990, the first changes were made {{in line with the}} report. The North Stand saw the addition of 2,900 seats to the lower tier of the stand in place of terracing, the Holte End's roof was extended in preparation for more seats, the Trinity Road Stand had its roof replaced, and the Witton Lane Stand had more corporate boxes added. By that time, all four floodlight pylons had been removed to make way for boxes or in preparation for seating, and new floodlights were installed on new gantries on the Trinity and Witton stands. In February 1992, the club's application to the Council for permission to demolish the Holte Hotel was rejected. After several months of negotiations, Villa gained permission for a new stand to replace the Witton Lane Stand. The new design meant that the club had to realign Witton Lane and, as a condition of the planning permission, pay £600,000 to compulsory purchase the houses along Witton Lane and upgrade the road from a B to an A road, as well as moving its utilities. The stand was fully operational by January 1994 at the cost of £5million with 4,686 seats, which brought Villa Park up to a capacity of 46,005. It was announced at the 70th birthday gala of chairman Doug Ellis that the stand was to be renamed the [...] "Doug Ellis Stand", a move that caused some controversy among Villa fans with some still referring to it as the Witton Lane Stand. Nevertheless, during the 1993–1994 season, the newly rebuilt Witton Lane Stand became the Doug Ellis Stand. The Holte End was the only remaining stand that did not meet the Taylor Report requirements, and a <b>structural</b> <b>survey</b> revealed that putting seats onto the existing terracing would be uneconomical. Instead, the decision was taken to build a new stand consisting of two tiers, just four years after construction of the new roof. The demolition of the stand began {{on the last day of}} the 1993–94 season. Its replacement began to open in August 1994 with 3,000 seats in the lower tier occupied for the first seating-only game at Villa Park. By December it was fully operational and had a capacity of 13,501 seats, bringing the Villa Park capacity to 40,310. Upon completion, the Holte was the largest single end stand in Britain.|$|E
2500|$|Deterioration {{continued}} {{during the}} latter 20th century and worsened by a storm in 1989, causing extensive damage. Despite its listed status, Sefton Council sought to demolish the pier in December 1990 due to {{the rising cost of}} repairs and maintenance, yet was defeated by a single vote. Operating at an annual loss of £100,000 and with estimates close to £1 million to secure the future of the pier, plus a further £250,000 required every five years for repainting, a charitable trust was formed in 1993 to upkeep the pier; various funding was secured in the subsequent years to maintain the pier's operation. In February 1997, a grant of £34,000 (...) was provided from lottery funding in order for a <b>structural</b> <b>survey</b> to be undertaken, confirming the pier's then poor condition and recommending its closure. In October 1998, the pier received a heritage grant of £1.7 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund, awarded to support restoration and access.|$|E

2500|$|A <b>structural</b> <b>survey</b> in 1776 {{indicated}} that the chancel was deteriorating but the nave was sound. [...] The first round of Victorian restoration came in 1856, when a gallery was inserted; the chancel was rebuilt and heightened between 1876 and 1877; and in 1883 the nave was altered, a vestry was added, the gallery was taken out and a wooden bell-turret was built at {{the west end of}} the building. [...] Nikolaus Pevsner stated that after this work, the church was [...] "too heavily restored to be attractive", and others have noted that the present appearance of the church is derived mostly from its 19th-century modifications.

40|$|Recently, for {{the purpose}} of data management, more {{advanced}} digital data are required for different survey levels of irregular ancient monuments. For irregularly formed monuments and amorphous surfaces, 2 D photographs and 2 D measured surveys are inadequate to illustrate the condition of the building for condition reports or relationships between components and materials for <b>structural</b> <b>surveys</b> and conservation decisions, especially in archeological remains. However, image-based documentation techniques can be used as simple tools for different types of surveys due to their ease of use and fast and economical properties. Therefore, the aim of the study is to test multi-image photogrammetric documentation techniques to improve and standardize visual data appending condition reports and further detailed reports regarding conservation of irregular ancient monuments. In the literature, there are many studies about image-based documentation techniques. However, the innovation of the study is to provide an improvement of the pipeline of condition and <b>structural</b> <b>surveys</b> of irregular ancient monuments by making use of photogrammetric techniques. In order to measure the effects {{of the relationship between the}} type of documentation technique and survey level on the photogrammetric documentation process of an ancient monument, a series of experiments were designed and the results compared. For this purpose, automated image orientation packages Autodesk 123 D and Photosynth and manual image orientation package Tgi 3 D were evaluated in terms of process time, reliability and level of detail to identify appropriate techniques for different survey levels. This study proved that documentation of the structural characteristics of ancient monuments can be achieved successfully with the Tgi 3 D package, which has manual workflows. The documentation results might support structural intervention decisions. The 3 D models based on automatic workflows might support a preliminary condition survey, since their production takes a relatively short time and scaled models are acceptable for identifying mass characteristics...|$|R
