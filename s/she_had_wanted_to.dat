5|$|The {{film was}} shot in Jordan, within miles of the Iraqi border, to achieve Bigelow's goal of authenticity. Iraqi {{refugees}} were used for extras and the cast worked in the intense heat of the Middle East. The filmmakers had scouted for locations in Morocco, but director Kathryn Bigelow felt its cities did not resemble Baghdad. In addition, {{she wanted to get}} as close to the war zone as possible. Some of the locations were less than three miles from the Iraq border. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> film in Iraq, but the production security team could not guarantee their safety from snipers.|$|E
5|$|Many {{actors were}} {{considered}} to replace Reeves including: Simon Baker Denny, Jon Bon Jovi, Patrick Muldoon, Johnathon Schaech, Christian Slater, and Billy Zane. Bullock initially suggested Matthew McConaughey, who passed on the role, prompting her to suggest Jason Patric, with whom <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> work since seeing his performance in After Dark, My Sweet (1990). De Bont was skeptical of featuring a relatively unknown actor such as Patric, but was reminded by the studio that Bullock and Reeves were also relatively unknown prior to Speed, and ultimately chose Patric based on his role in Sleepers (1996). Patric was paid a reported $4.5–$8 million {{for his role in}} Speed2 and used his salary to finance a 1998 drama, Your Friends & Neighbors. After accepting the role, Patric stated that he never saw Speed or had any intentions of seeing it; Reeves said he was looking forward to seeing Patric star in the sequel. After Reeves declined to appear in Speed2, the screenplay was rewritten to remove his character from the story, which De Bont wanted to deal with early in the film. His absence is explained in the first scene, where Annie talks about how her relationship with Jack did not work out, and mentions her current relationship with Alex (Patric), before his character is introduced in the film.|$|E

With help from Brooke's boyfriend, Vinnie Kruse (Pua Magasiva), Bree {{landed a job}} at the hospital alongside Brooke. However, after several icey interactions with her sister, Bree ended up dating Vinnie but started to suffer from her lack of self-confidence at work. Vinnie soon discovered Bree had only passed her medical exams by sleeping with her tutor and they broke up. Bree started to blackmail staff to keep her job but was suspended when she nearly killed a patient. Bree was devastated when Annette returned and admitted <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> abort Bree, resulting in Bree holding Annette captive, drugging and, mentally torturing her. Bree lost her job and after working as a medical supplies salesman, began sleeping with Kevin Johns (David Van Horn) under the identity of Brooke.

500|$|Furtado {{said that}} {{with the release of}} her albums before Loose, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> prove herself as a {{musician}} and earn respect from listeners through using many different instruments on an album, which most hip hop musicians did not do. After she believed she had accomplished that, she felt she had freedom to make the type of music she [...] "really love". Furtado said her previous problem with hip hop was that she did not think it was good enough to base one of her albums on, but that she then asked herself why she was being [...] "pretentious".|$|E
500|$|Le Guin herself {{later said}} she was unhappy with the [...] "strident" [...] tone of the novel.

Written in these circumstances, The Word for World is Forest became what Le Guin called a [...] "preachment".

I love acting and it's what I want to do, so why not be in the thick of it all? I certainly love to do more Aussie things but, being realistic, there is nowhere near as much opportunity here." [...] During her first interview since announcing her departure, Novakovic explained that her main reasons for leaving Neighbours were to try other things and explore different characters.

She organized a group of girls, directing and choreographing their dance routines. Unable to convince boys to participate, she acted the male roles and sang their songs. By age nine, she had developed an unusually low voice. Fascinated by film stars, Cher's role model was Audrey Hepburn, particularly due to {{her role in the}} 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's. Cher began to take after the unconventional outfits and behavior of Hepburn's character. She was disappointed by the absence of dark-haired Hollywood actresses whom she could emulate then. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be famous since childhood but felt unattractive and untalented, later commenting, [...] "I couldn't think of anything that I could do...

500|$|After several {{recording}} {{sessions with}} writers and producers like Paul Epworth, Fraser T Smith and Rick Rubin, Adele got enough material {{for creating a}} full LP. She released her second studio album on 19 January 2011 under the title 21. Adele first intended to title the album Rolling in the Deep, her adaptation of the slang phrase [...] "roll deep", which summarises how she felt about her relationship; in her loose translation, the phrase refers to having someone [...] "that has your back" [...] and always supports you. However, the singer later deemed the title too confusing for some of her audiences. Although <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> avoid the number motif of her debut, Adele considered [...] "21" [...] the most fitting title as it represented her age {{at the time of}} the album's composition, serving as an autobiographical period piece, [...] and symbolised the personal maturity and artistic evolution since her debut.|$|E

[...] Although <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> become a nurse, Hewson gave up on the notion, as the intense schooling required would have been incompatible with the direction that her husband's life had taken. [...] Instead she focused on studying in the social sciences, to give her an ability to understand social policy {{and make a difference}} to people, similar to what nursing would have enabled. [...] By Bono's own description, the marriage hit a period of strain in 1986 due to time commitments during the group's recording of The Joshua Tree. [...] Tensions continued in 1987 during the subsequent Joshua Tree Tour.|$|E
500|$|Plans for Lopez {{to release}} a Spanish {{language}} album materialized in 2004, when Lopez's then-husband Marc Anthony was finishing up production of his ninth studio album Amar Sin Mentiras (2004) with Estéfano and Julio Reyes.

She enjoyed working on the song {{so much that she}} decided to record a full-length Spanish album; something <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do for years. Prior to breaking out into the music scene in May 1999 with her single [...] "If You Had My Love", Lopez always pictured her music career to be in Spanish. According to Lopez: [...] "My life took a different turn, which was great for me. But my heart was always kind of on the Spanish side."

At one point in the song's production, <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> re-write the verses {{of the song}} because she did not think that they were [...] "funny or clever", feeling that they [...] "kind of sucked."

500|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{receives}} the mail {{of her new}} neighbor, Dr. Drew Baird (Jon Hamm). After going through it, she believes he is the perfect man for her. To try and woo him, she follows the actions of an evil Spanish soap character called [...] "The Generalissimo" [...] from Los Amantes Clandestinos, despite the warnings of Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) and Elisa (Salma Hayek). She invites Drew to a nonexistent party, and, when he arrives expecting a party, she informs him that the party is scheduled for the following evening, but nevertheless invites him in.

500|$|Both [...] "Mortal Folly" [...] and [...] "Mortal Recoil" [...] were {{directed}} by Larry Leichliter. The first half was written and storyboarded by Rebecca Sugar and Adam Muto, whereas {{the second half}} was written and storyboarded by Jesse Moynihan and Cole Sanchez. Both {{were based on a}} story by Mark Banker, Kent Osborne, Patrick McHale, and series creator Pendleton Ward. In the original outline for [...] "Mortal Folly", the Lich had several lines that played him off as a stereotypical villain. Sugar and Muto decided to make him into a more [...] "scary and dangerous" [...] character, and purposely played up the darker elements of the episode. In addition, Princess Bubblegum's sweater was supposed to be [...] "magic" [...] and [...] "shoot lasers". However, Sugar felt that it would be more emotionally poignant if the sweater was just a regular sweater imbued with positive emotions. The scene featuring Finn stuffing the sweater into the Lich's eye sockets and then ripping his skull apart was inspired by an artistic design idea Sugar had had when she was in high school; <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> draw a comic featuring a small person getting into a fight and being pushed up to the ceiling.|$|E
