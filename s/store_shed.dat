60|$|Some {{time had}} passed, {{and the greater}} portion of Hudson's ranch still lay under water when, in {{consequence}} of representations made by its owner {{and some of his}} friends, a Government official armed with full powers to investigate held an informal court of inquiry in the big <b>store</b> <b>shed,</b> at which most of the neighboring ranchers were present. Geoffrey and Thomas Savine, who brought a lawyer with him, awaited the proceedings with some impatience.|$|E

Our <b>store</b> <b>shed</b> stands in a thicket among the trees yonder close beneath us. We built it there not to be conspicuous, and they may not notice it, but it is only a few weeks since our {{supplies}} came in--drugs and cloth, besides tools, and goods that we could not replace." ...|$|E
60|$|One morning Trafford {{found the}} footmarks of some catlike {{creature}} {{in the snow}} near the bushes where he was accustomed to get firewood; they led away very plainly up the hill, and after breakfast he took his knife and rifle and snowshoes and went after the lynx--for that he decided the animal must be. There was no urgent reason why he should want to kill a lynx, unless perhaps that killing it made the <b>store</b> <b>shed</b> a trifle safer; {{but it was the}} first trail of any living thing for many days; it promised excitement; some primordial instinct perhaps urged him.|$|E
5000|$|Commodore Sir Gordon Bremer {{raised the}} Union Jack and claimed Hong Kong as a colony on 26 January 1841. Naval <b>store</b> <b>sheds</b> were erected there in April 1841. The site had been {{referred}} to as the [...] "HM Victualling Yard" [...] in the Navy's own register. The first naval storekeeper and agent victualler, Thomas McKnight, appointed on 21 March 1842, served until October 1849. Early maps show that major construction was also carried out at another, slightly more westward site, between 1845 and 1855. In fact, the naval authorities demolished the West Point <b>store</b> <b>sheds</b> and surrendered the land to the colonial government in 1854 in exchange for a plot of land where the Admiralty station of the Mass Transit Railway stands.|$|R
25|$|The station {{includes}} two cottages, constructed in 1960, timber framed, fibro clad, with galvanised iron roofs. One of the cottages has two storeys and a closed verandah, {{while the other}} is single leveled with an open verandah. The station also comprises a winch house, <b>stores</b> <b>shed,</b> engine room and combined workshop/radio room.|$|R
50|$|In 1920, {{with local}} consent, Obbe was renamed Leverburgh, and 300 men started {{work on a}} new pier and {{seashore}} infrastructure for processing the catch from 50 berthed trawlers. Shore side construction covered an accommodation block, curing sheds, smoke houses, a refrigeration building, <b>store</b> <b>sheds,</b> houses for the managers and a twenty car garage.|$|R
60|$|She {{found the}} camping-place {{piled high with}} drifted snow, which had invaded tent and hut, and that some beast, a {{wolverine}} she guessed, had been into the hut, devoured every candle-end and the uppers of Trafford's well-greased second boots, and had then gone {{to the corner of}} the <b>store</b> <b>shed</b> and clambered up to the stores. She made no account of its depredations there, but set herself to make a sledge and get her supplies together. There was a gleam of sunshine, but she did not like the look of the sky, and she was horribly afraid of what might be happening to Trafford. She carried her stuff through the wood and across the ravine, and returned for her improvised sledge. She was still struggling with that among the trees when it began to snow again.|$|E
60|$|More figures {{appeared}} {{behind the}} others, and they flitted across {{the strip of}} open space towards the <b>store</b> <b>shed,</b> after which there were hoarse shouts and a sound of hammering which ceased again. Then Herrero's boys came back by twos and threes, big, muscular negroes with short draperies fluttering from their hips, some of them lurching drunkenly. Three or four also carried long flintlock guns, {{and the one who}} had the whip still dragged the Mission boy along. They stopped in the clear space beneath the house, and Nares, who felt his heart beat, set his lips tight as one of them strode forward {{to the foot of the}} short veranda stairway. He was almost naked, and for a moment or two the white men sat still, and looked at him. It was, they felt, just possible that at the last moment his assurance would fail him. Perhaps, he understood what they were thinking, for he made a little contemptuous gesture.|$|E
60|$|Two {{white men}} lounged in cane chairs upon the veranda which encircled the building. Both were limp, gaunt of frame, and pallid in face, because the climate {{they lived in}} is {{particularly}} unhealthy. Neither had enjoyed much education, or felt {{the lack of it}} in the trade they followed, while the cocktail jug on the little table betokened their favorite relaxation. Redmond and Gilby were West Coast traders who lived far remote from intercourse with their fellows, except for the two French rivals with whom they periodically quarreled. They concerned themselves with little beyond the well-being of their factory, and indulged each appetite on opportunity, knowing that on the morrow they might suddenly die. Yet they had their strong points, including a tenacious regard for their employers' interests, which led them to toil twelve hours daily when sick of fever if trade was good, and sometimes defy the French authorities, and an inconsistent generosity, as the result of which they had camped in the <b>store</b> <b>shed,</b> and turned over their own quarters to the man who stood behind them, and his stricken companion. The former was of very different type.|$|E
50|$|The former Kingaroy Butter Factory complex {{stands at}} the {{northern}} end of William Street, Kingaroy north west of the CBD of Kingaroy and adjacent to the formation of the Kilkivan/Kingaroy railway line. The complex comprises the main butter factory shed, 1940s cheese factory, ice works shed, former office, amenities and cold <b>stores</b> <b>shed,</b> modern cheese making facility {{and a number of other}} sheds and structures.|$|R
5|$|L'Estrange {{performed}} in the Domain from January through to April 1877, but not without incident. On 7 February 1877, as L'Estrange neared {{the end of his}} wire act, sparks from the fireworks going off around him fell into the nearby store of gunpowder and fireworks, igniting them. The <b>store's</b> <b>shed</b> was demolished, a surrounding fence knocked down, part of L'Estrange's performance tent caught fire, and two young boys were injured.|$|R
50|$|Snave is a {{very small}} hamlet on Romney Marsh in Kent, England centred close to the A2070 road 8 mi south of Ashford. Its {{buildings}} are a few houses, barns and <b>store</b> <b>sheds</b> and the church of St Augustine which holds one service per year at harvest festival. In spring, the churchyard is heavily clad in daffodils. The church falls under the ecumenical/ecclesiastical (Anglican/Methodist) parish of Hamstreet and Orlestone but the civil parish administering local services is Brenzett.|$|R
60|$|The men {{had engaged}} {{to build the}} {{framework}} of hut and <b>store</b> <b>shed</b> before returning, and to this under Trafford's direction they now set themselves. They were all half-breeds, mingling with Indian with Scottish or French blood, sober and experienced men. Three were named Mackenzie, two brothers and a cousin, and another, Raymond Noyes, was a relation and acquaintance of that George Elson who was with Wallace and Leonidas Hubbard, and afterwards guided Mrs. Hubbard in her crossing of Labrador. The fifth was a boy of eighteen named Lean. They were all familiar {{with the idea of}} summer travel in this country; quite a number, a score or so that is to say, of adventurous people, including three or four women, had ventured far {{in the wake of the}} Hubbards into these great wildernesses during the decade that followed that first tragic experiment in which Hubbard died. But that any one not of Indian or Esquimaux blood should propose to face out the Labrador winter was a new thing to them. They were really very sceptical at the outset whether these two highly civilized-looking people would ever get up to the Height of Land at all, and it was still with manifest incredulity that they set about the building of the hut and the construction of the sleeping bunks for which they had brought up planking. A stream of speculative talk had flowed along beside Marjorie and Trafford ever since they had entered the Green River; and it didn't so much come to an end as get cut off at last by the necessity of their departure.|$|E
50|$|The station {{building}} {{is now a}} private house and the trackbed has been infilled to platform height. The old station master's house also survives as a private dwelling. The old corrugated <b>store</b> <b>shed</b> still survives.|$|E
50|$|Various {{buildings}} exist, some {{dating back}} to the early 1950s: Sleeping quarters are in Southern Aurora Dongas (SAD), Garden Cove (Dorm), Hasselborough House and Cumpston's Cottage. A combined mess and kitchen adjoins the doctor's surgery. Storage exists in the main <b>store</b> <b>shed</b> and a large field <b>store</b> <b>shed.</b> The various trades there have their own workshops. A main and standby powerhouse provide electricity and reticulated heating water via a heat exchanger on the diesel generators. Water is sourced from a dam at the top of Gadget's Gully and piped to storage tanks at the station. Sewage is treated before discharge and garbage is sorted for recycling (back in Hobart) or incineration on site. Scientific facilities exist in the Biology Building, Physics Building and Bureau of Meteorology buildings. Various outbuildings support instrumentation such as ionosondes, seismometers and upper atmospheric experiments. A tide gauge is installed in Garden Cove.|$|E
5000|$|The {{workshops}} {{which served}} {{the needs of}} the quarry and its locomotives, were built in 1870 on land created from the continuous tipping of spoil from the adjacent Vivian Quarry, and as a replacement for the <b>store</b> <b>sheds</b> which were previously sited there. Rail access to the works was by both [...] narrow gauge (the quarry gauge) and [...] narrow gauge (that of the Padarn Railway which carried the slate from the quarry to Port Dinorwic). Rails also entered the main yard through the main entrance.|$|R
50|$|Warrawagine was {{established}} in 1896 and was initially managed by Frank Thompson and his wife Ceclia. The homestead was built in 1901 along with the <b>store,</b> workshop <b>shed</b> and blacksmith shop.|$|R
50|$|In late 1919, Leverhulme {{purchased}} the South Harris estate from the Earl of Dunmore for {{the sum of}} £36,000. Taking in the Western Isles fishing village of Obbe, he planned {{to turn it into}} a consolidated major fishing centre, with product distributed through the Mac Fisheries shops. In 1920, Obbe with local consent was rebranded Leverburgh, and 300 men started work on a new pier and seashore infrastructure for processing the product from 50 berthed trawlers. Shore side construction covered an accommodation block, curing sheds, smoke houses, a refrigeration building, <b>store</b> <b>sheds,</b> houses for the managers and a 20 car garage.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, Lion Salt Works was a {{candidate}} on the BBC's Restoration programme. [...] The surviving buildings are {{recorded in the}} National Heritage List for England as designated Grade II listed buildings. The specific buildings listed are the canal salt shed, the engine shed and pump house, the office in the works yard, and the pan sheds and stoves and the <b>store</b> <b>shed</b> behind the works. [...] The buildings are registered as a Scheduled Ancient Monument. [...] The site is recognised as an Anchor Point of the European Route of Industrial Heritage.|$|E
50|$|Stud Lodge {{was built}} in 1881-82 as a <b>store</b> <b>shed</b> and {{domestic}} offices for the 1st Duke of Westminster on his estate at Eaton Hall and designed by the Chester architect John Douglas. It is built in two storeys in red brick with some timber framing and has a red tile roof. The wing of the building to the right has a circular lower storey in brick over which, supported by corbels, is an octagonal timber framed upper storey, surmounted by a spire that includes a small dormer. To the left is a wing, entirely in brick, with a polygonal apse-like end, multiple windows in the upper storey, and a finial on the apex of its roof.|$|E
5000|$|Dallow Lane, {{also known}} as the Excelsior Ground, had a {{capacity}} of about 7,000 - most spectators would simply stand behind a rope close to the pitch, and there was a seated grandstand constructed in 1894. The stand was [...] "120 feet long, 18 feet high, 13 feet deep and had five tiers of seats". Due to Dallow Lane's close proximity to the Luton to Dunstable railway line, players claimed to have trouble playing due to smoke from the engines. The club made a damaging financial loss during 1896-97 and was forced to sell the ground to stay afloat. Luton Town left Dallow Lane in April to play at Dunstable Road. The Dallow Lane grandstand remained on the site until the mid-20th century, used as a <b>store</b> <b>shed.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Queen saw the {{destruction}} of British products as an insult and sent the first expeditionary force to the region. The First Opium War (1839–1842) began {{at the hands of}} Captain Charles Elliot of the Royal Navy and Capt. Anthony Blaxland Stransham of the Royal Marines. After a series of Chinese defeats, Hong Kong Island was occupied by the British on 20 January 1841. Sir Edward Belcher, aboard HMS Sulphur, landed in Hong Kong on 25 January 1841. Possession Street still exists to mark the event. [...] Commodore Sir Gordon Bremer raised the Union Jack and claimed Hong Kong as a colony on 26 January 1841. He erected naval <b>store</b> <b>sheds</b> there in April 1841.|$|R

50|$|Menor's Ferry was a river ferry {{that crossed}} the Snake River near the present-day Moose, Wyoming, United States. The site was homesteaded by Bill Menor in 1892-94, {{choosing}} a location {{where the river}} flowed in a single channel, rather than the braided stream that characterizes its course in most of Jackson Hole. During the 1890s {{it was the only}} homestead west of the river. Menor's homestead included a five-room cabin, a barn, a <b>store,</b> <b>sheds</b> and an icehouse on 148 acre, irrigated by a ditch from Cottonwood Creek and at times supplemented by water raised from the Snake River by a waterwheel. Menor operated the ferry until 1918, selling to Maude Noble, who continued operations until 1927, when a bridge was built at Moose.|$|R
50|$|In 1886 Mariano Vella {{obtained}} a sublease of Mana from Wright. He knew little of farming, and arranged that Harry Harris of Pauatahanui would teach him sheep husbandry and farming practice. The Vella {{family lived in}} Station Road at Paremata, while Mariano sailed {{to and from the}} island on most days. At first he devoted his energy to stocking the island's 536 acre with sheep. The Mana Island lighthouse, built in 1864 and discontinued in 1877, had been shifted to Cape Egmont. Mariano Vella bought one remaining keeper's cottage, dismantled it and rebuilt it close to an existing <b>store</b> <b>shed</b> on {{the eastern side of the}} island. In 1887 he built a small woolshed that still stands. At shearing time Mary and the children would come across to live at Mana. The life of the family was shattered when Mary died of a heart attack on 22 December 1889 at the age of 20.|$|E

40|$|The {{estimated}} 100, 000 tons of obsolete pesticides lying unused {{in developing}} countries represents a tremendous potential hazard to {{human health and the}} environment. The size of the problem is such that it cannot be solved by the farmer alone. Nonetheless, the farmer would of course benefit from heeding the directives of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and of NGOs specialised in environmental protection such the UK-based Pesticides Trust. Guidelines have been written that cover how to prevent stockpiling, and how to destroy, pesticides which have exceeded their 'use by' date. The build-up of a stockpile can be avoided through simple steps such as calculating the amount of pesticides required; checking their use dates; proper storage; and incinerating used and empty pesticides packages. Time is money and can be hazardous. International organisations calculate that the cost of destroying 10 tonnes of obsolete pesticides can reach up to$US 80, 000. Cleaning up the polluted planet - and the <b>store</b> <b>shed</b> - obviously costs more than keeping it clean in the first place.

2500|$|With several {{alterations}} and additions, {{this station}} served Lyttelton for 90 years until {{replaced by a}} modern structure in 1963. The station offices were placed {{at right angles to}} the passenger platforms, originally on the western side of Oxford Street, but later being moved {{to the other side of}} the same street in about 1882. The platform was lengthened in 1903 to accommodate an additional two carriages, necessitating the relocation of the lamp room to a position near the engine <b>shed.</b> The railway <b>stores</b> <b>shed</b> was destroyed by fire, presumed to be arson, on 6 November 1937. Following the removal of a siding to Kinsey & Company's store near the station, a [...] extension of the platform at the west end was authorised in 1950, after difficulties were experienced in placing mixed consists (a common practice at the time) at the platform.|$|R
