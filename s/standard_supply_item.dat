40|$|The {{modification}} of the Siemens electron microscope grid-holder suggested by Elbers (1) among its other advantages reduces contamination by reducing {{the handling of the}} specimen holder either with the fingers or using paper tissue or other fabrics. By using the set of collets described here such handling is entirely eliminated although the operations involved in changing the specimen may still be made easily. Received for publication, June 22, 1960. Figs. 1 to 10 on the facing page show the sequence of operations on extracting the holder from the microscope and dismantling for a specimen change. The specimen holder shown is the type which receives 3 mm. diameter grids. Both the collet tools are made from phosphor-bronze and terminate at each end as split collets, except for the threaded portion A (Fig. 11) which is a <b>standard</b> <b>item</b> <b>supplied</b> with the microscope.

50|$|Kraljic (1983) {{considered}} two variables: profit {{impact and}} supply risk. The profit {{impact of a}} given <b>supply</b> <b>item</b> can be {{defined in terms of}} the volume purchased, the percentage of total purchase cost or the impact on product quality or business growth. Supply risk is assessed in terms of the availability and number of suppliers, competitive demand, make-or-buy opportunities, storage risks and substitution possibilities. Based on these two variables, materials or components can be divided into four supply categories: (1) non-critical <b>items</b> (<b>supply</b> risk: low; profit impact: low), (2) leverage <b>items,</b> (<b>supply</b> risk: low; profit impact: high), (3) bottleneck <b>items</b> (<b>supply</b> risk: high; profit impact: low), and (4) strategic <b>items</b> (<b>supply</b> risk: high; profit impact: high). Each category requires a specific supplier strategy.|$|R

The automated logistics planning system described in this thesis addressed this deficiency. The program developed in this research produces general estimates for selected <b>supply</b> <b>items</b> by referencing equations and variables from current Army planning documents and performing the necessary calculation. The program uses reasoning to identify previous operations which are analogous to the current operation. Separate criteria are used to identify the strongest analogies to the current operations for each of five categories of <b>supply</b> <b>items.</b> Information contained in the historical records of the three strongest analogies in each category is used to revise the general estimates. The revised estimates are hopefully more accurate in predicting actual supply requirements for the current operation than the estimates generated by formula alone. [URL] United States Arm...|$|R
