40|$|We have {{examined}} the hypothesis that TNF may play a pathogenetically {{important role in the}} hemolytic uremic syndrome. Specifically, we considered the possibility that <b>shigatoxin,</b> which eventuates this syndrome, might induce TNF biosynthesis, and/or that TNF and <b>shigatoxin</b> might sensitize animals, each to the toxic effects of the other agent. <b>Shigatoxin</b> was found to sensitize mice to the lethal effect of LPS and to the lethal effect of TNF. On the other hand, pretreatment of animals with either TNF or LPS did not noticeably sensitize mice to the lethal effect of <b>shigatoxin.</b> Intraperitoneal injections of <b>shigatoxin</b> did not induce the production of detectable quantities of TNF in the plasma of mice. When <b>shigatoxin</b> was injected into transgenic mice bearing a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene that indicates TNF synthesis, CAT activity was induced within the kidney, but not in other tissues. We therefore conclude that <b>shigatoxin</b> acts to induce TNF synthesis within the kidney, {{and at the same time}} increases renal sensitivity to the toxic effects of TNF. While this mouse model does not reproduce the hemolytic uremic syndrome as it occurs in humans, it does suggest that local synthesis of TNF within the kidney may contribute to renal injury induced by <b>shigatoxin...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract Haemolytic uraemic {{syndrome}} (HUS) can {{be classified}} according to the aetiology of the different disorders from which it is composed. The most prevalent form is that induced by <b>shigatoxin</b> producing Escherichia coli (STEC) and, in some tropical regions, by Shigella dysenteriae type 1. STEC cause a zoonosis, are widely distributed in nature, enter the food chain in different ways, and show regional differences. Not all STEC are human pathogens. Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli usually cause attachment and effacing lesions in the intestine. This is not essential, but production of a <b>shigatoxin</b> (Stx) is. Because Stx are encoded by a bacteriophage, this property is transferable to naïve strains. Laboratory methods have improved by identifying STEC either via the toxin or its bacteriophage. Shigella dysenteriae type 1 produces <b>shigatoxin,</b> identical to Stx- 1, but also has entero-invasive properties that enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) do not. Shigella patients risk bacteremia and benefit from early antibiotic treatment, unlike those with EHEC...|$|E

Among the Diarrhegenic Escherichia Coli (DEC) this work was focused on the Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia Coli (EHEC) that produce <b>Shigatoxins</b> (Stxs). The infection is mainly transmitted through food of bovine origin such as beef and dairy products that has been often associated with outbreaks which ranged from mild diarrhea to the life-threatening hemolytic uremic syndrome. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of potentially virulent STEC isolates from minced meat, some selected dairy products and from children clinical cases.

Introduction of the genetic background CASA/Rk (a mouse strain with elevated plasma vWF) resulted in the appearance of spontaneous thrombocytopenia in a subset of ADAMTS 13 -deficient mice and significantly decreased survival. Challenge of these mice with <b>shigatoxin</b> (derived from bacterial pathogens associated with the related human disease hemolytic uremic syndrome) resulted in a striking syndrome closely resembling human TTP. Surprisingly, no correlation was observed between plasma vWF level and severity of TTP, implying the existence of TTP-modifying genes distinct from vWF.

40|$|Abstract: Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O 157 : H 7 {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} causes of bloody diarrhea. This bacterium is able to make bloody diarrhea or Hemorrhagic Colitis (HC) through verotoxin or <b>shigatoxin</b> production, and in acute forms it may lead to Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS) or Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpurea (TTP). Contamination with E. coli O 157 :H 7 usually happens after consumption of animal products especially undercooked meats. The most important reservoir of this bacterium is beef and consumption of undercooked ground beef, especially in children younger than 10 years old, is the most common reason of food infection by this bacterium. Two important biochemical characteristics for detection of E. coli O 157 : H 7 are lack of sorbitol fermentation and absence of glucuronidase. In order to control food infection with this bacterium, foods must be cooked thoroughly until reaching the temperature of at least 68. 3 °C, in the center.

40|$|Development of a {{biosensor}} for {{the simultaneous}} detection of microorganisms and toxins This project {{aimed at the}} development of a novel test system (parallel affinity sensor array, PASA) enabling the rapid, parallel and automated detection of microorganisms and toxins (Y. pestis, F. tularensis, C. burnetii, <b>shigatoxins</b> 1 und 2, Staphylococcal enterotoxin B und orthopoxvirus). For this purpose the classical sandwich-EIA principle was combined with the innovative microarray technology. The core of the biosensor is a planar biochip represented by a modified microscope slide on which the different tests run in parallel. The detection is enabled by specific antibodies attached to the slides surface by covalent or adsorptive binding. All further incubation steps are performed in a flow-through cell, reagents are automatically supplied by computer controlled pumps. With respect to the implementation of the detection methods in the PASA system each single-analyte assay was optimized by using classical EIA techniques and then adapted to a uniform test procedure. To enhance assay sensitivity the Biotin/ExtrAvidin, the Digoxigenin/anti-digoxigenin and partially fluorescence detection methods were checked. The most sensitive assays could be established by using detection antibodies labelled with digoxigenin. The detection limits of the optimized assays were in the range of 103 - 104 cfu/ml, microbial toxins could be detected at the pg-level. For transferring these optimized assays from microtiter plates to the biosensor platform a broad range of different biochip surfaces were tested. With some of the tested materials major problems encountered either due to inactivation of the antibodies during the immobilization on covalently binding solid phases or due to bleaching-out of antibody-coated adsorptive surfaces. The use of antibodies labelled with fluorochromes proved to be a failure. Two chemiluminescent microarray tests which complied with the basic requirements adherent to the establishment of an automated rapid detection method were further optimized and evaluated for robustness. Both assays enabled the reliable and reproducible detection of bacteria (105 – 107 cfu/ml) and purified toxins (lower ng-range) within 25 min.

Therefore, to examine directly the requirement for VWF in TTP pathogenesis, we generated ADAMTS 13 -deficient mice on a TTP-susceptible genetic background that were also either haploinsufficient (Vwf+/−) or completely deficient (Vwf−/−) in VWF. Absence of VWF resulted in complete protection from <b>shigatoxin</b> (Stx) –induced thrombocytopenia, demonstrating an absolute requirement for VWF in this model (Stx has been shown previously to trigger TTP in ADAMTS 13 -deficient mice). We next investigated the requirements for ADAMTS 13 and VWF in a murine model of endotoxemia. Unlike Stx-induced TTP findings, LPS-induced thrombocytopenia and mortality were not affected by either VWF or ADAMTS 13 deficiency, suggesting divergent mechanisms of thrombocytopenia between these 2 disorders. Finally, we show that VWF deficiency abrogates the ADAMTS 13 -deficient prothrombotic state, suggesting VWF as the only relevant ADAMTS 13 substrate under these conditions. Together, these findings shed new light on the potential roles played by ADAMTS 13 and VWF in TTP, endotoxemia, and normal hemostasis...|$|E
40|$|Brain {{injury in}} hemolytic-uremic {{syndrome}} (HUS) may {{be enhanced by}} inflammatory cytokine up-regulation of endothelial cell sensitivity to <b>shigatoxin</b> (Stx). The present study investigated whether inflammatory cytokine up-regulation of Stx toxicity could be ameliorated by inhibiting candidate signal transduction pathways. Exposure of human brain endothelial cells (HBECs) to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) greatly increased Stx- 1 and Stx- 2 cytotoxicity; this was reduced by inhibition of p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), but not c-Jun kinase. SB 203580, a specific inhibitor of p 38 MAPK, reduced TNF-stimulated Stx cytotoxicity in HBECs, TNF-stimulated 125 Stx- 1 binding to intact HBECs, the cellular content of Gb 3 (galactose a 1, 4, galactose ß 1, 4, glucose-ceramide) (the Stx receptor), and TNF-stimulated Gb 3 synthase and glucosylceramide synthase activities but did not affect lactosylceramide synthase activities or mRNA content. Thus, inhibition of p 38 MAPK substantially reduces inflammatory cytokine up-regulation of Stx-receptor synthesis and cell-surface expression, thereby decreasing Stx cytotoxicity. Inhibition of p 38 MAPK may be of therapeutic benefit in HUS. Hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) is characterized by acute renal injury, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia [1, 2].

The principal reservoirs of EHEC are cattle and food products, which presumably have come into contact with domestic animal manure and/or are inadequately pasteurised, these are important vehicles of infection. In the present study, the PCR technique with primers detecting the verocytotoxin genes was shown to be a possible method to screen for and identify EHEC.

Because podocytes are highly sensitive to Stx cytotoxicity and represent {{a source of}} vasoactive molecules, we studied whether Stx- 2 modulated the production of endothelin- 1 (ET- 1), taken as candidate mediator of podocyte dysfunction. Stx- 2 enhanced ET- 1 mRNA and protein expression via activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and activator protein- 1 (Ap- 1) {{to the extent that}} transfection with the dominant-negative mutant of IκB-kinase 2 or with Ap- 1 decoy oligodeoxynucleotides reduced ET- 1 mRNA levels. We propose a role for p 38 and p 42 / 44 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in mediating NF-κB-dependent gene transcription induced by Stx- 2, based on data that Stx- 2 phosphorylated p 38 and p 42 / 44 MAPKs and that MAPK inhibitors reduced transcription of NF-κB promoter/luciferase reporter gene construct induced by Stx- 2. Stx- 2 caused F-actin redistribution and intercellular gaps via production of ET- 1 acting on ETA receptor, because cytoskeleton changes were prevented by ETA receptor blockade. Exogenous ET- 1 induced cytoskeleton rearrangement and intercellular gaps via phosphatidylinositol- 3 kinase and Rho-kinase pathway and increased protein permeability across the podocyte monolayer. These data suggest that the podocyte is a target of Stx, a novel stimulus for the synthesis of ET- 1, which may control cytoskeleton remodeling and glomerular permeability in an autocrine fashion...|$|E

The E. coli 0166 organisms did not adhere to HEp- 2 cells in a localized, diffuse, or enteroaggregative manner. The organisms did not express known enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) colonization factors. In polymerase chain reaction tests, the bacteria did not have coding genes for <b>shigatoxin</b> of enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), heat-labile, or heat-stable enterotoxin of ETEC, attachment and effacement (eaeA) of EPEC, or invasion (invE) of enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC).

40|$|Effect of shigatoxin- 1 on arachidonate release {{by human}} glomerular {{epithelial}} cells. BackgroundAltered arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism has {{been implicated in}} the pathogenesis of renal injury in the hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). However, {{there is very little}} information of the effect of <b>shigatoxin</b> (Stx; the putative mediator of renal damage in HUS) on AA release or metabolism by renal cells. Since recent studies have demonstrated that glomerular epithelial cells (GECs) may be important early targets of Stx, the current study was undertaken {{to examine the effects of}} Stx on AA release and metabolism by GECs. MethodsCultured human GECs were exposed to Stx 1 ± lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 4 to 48 hours followed by determination of 3 H-arachidonate release, thromboxane A 2 (TxA 2) and prostacyclin (PGI 2) production, cyclooxygenase (COX) activity, and Western and Northern analyses for phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) and COX protein and mRNA levels, respectively. ResultsStx 1 increased arachidonate release by GECs. LPS alone had no such effect, but increased arachidonate release in response to Stx 1. Stx 1 -stimulated arachidonate release correlated with elevations in cPLA 2 and sPLA 2 protein and cPLA 2 mRNA levels. Stx 1 also increased both TxA 2 and PGI 2 production by GECs; LPS alone did not alter eicosanoid production, but augmented Stx 1 effects. Both Stx 1 and LPS stimulated COX activity; however, these effects were not additive. Although there was an accompanying elevation of COX- 1 and COX- 2 mRNA, Stx 1 decreased and LPS did not change COX 1 and COX 2 protein levels. ConclusionsStx 1 alone or in conjunction with LPS increases arachidonate release and eicosanoid production by human GECs; this effect correlates with increased PLA 2 protein and mRNA levels. To our knowledge, this is the first study identifying the mechanisms of Stx 1 -stimulated AA release.

They cause almost 1. 5 million of cases of disease {{each year in the}} US. Due to their public health impact, development of new methods for their detection and identification are top priority. This research focused on identifying alternative molecular methods and markers for the identification of STEC and Salmonella. First, a suspension array was developed to simultaneously identify the seven most prevalent STEC (O 26, O 45, O 103, O 111, O 121, O 145, and O 157) in the US. The panel targeted genes wzx or wzy and <b>Shigatoxin</b> genes. Testing and optimization employed four to eleven isolates of each serotype in the panel. STEC fluorescence values were 30 to > 270 times greater than those of negative controls, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for the molecular serotyping of STEC. STEC strains (n= 194) of 43 serotypes were examined for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) arrays to study relatedness among serotypes. A subset of strains (n= 81) was analyzed for cas and virulence genes to determine a possible relationship. CRISPR spacer content correlated well with serotypes, although some strains with different serogroup but the same H type shared identical arrays (O 26 :H 11, O 103 :H 11, and O 111 :H 11). cas and virulence genes were not associated, but strains with greater probability of causing outbreaks and disease showed fewer spacers than those less likely to cause them (p< 0. 05). Therefore, CRISPR array content correlated well with STEC serotype, and CRISPR-cas systems were inversely related to strain virulence potential. Finally, the CRISPR arrays of 221 S. enterica of 53 serotypes were analyzed to define their relationship. CRISPR-cas systems of 50 S. enterica serotype Bareilly (S. Bareilly) were analyzed to resolve intra-serotype variations. CRISPR arrays correlated well with serotypes, although some serotypes displayed more than one type of array (e. g. S. Bareilly). Additionally, CRISPR-cas system elements reflected S. Bareilly phylogeny, but the array content was not linked to food vehicle or isolate's geographical origin. In conclusion, CRISPR array are useful for designing molecular serotyping assays, but a range of strains should be included to account for variation in S. enterica...|$|E

In this retrospective study clinical and laboratory data of acute phase and of 1 - to 10 -year follow-up visits of children with HUS was analysed. The classification was based on the following criteria: STEC-HUS (proof of EHEC/STEC or <b>Shigatoxin,</b> (bloody) diarrhea, age of onset 2 – 5 years, neither relapse, nor familiarity) and atypical HUS (aHUS; all other cases). Patients were divided into 4 groups (Gr. 1 : STEC-HUS, 1976 – 1995, Gr. 2 : STEC-HUS, 1996 – 2014, Gr. 3 : aHUS, 1976 – 1995, Gr. 4 : aHUS, 1996 – 2014). Renal sequelae were defined as the presence of at least one of the following parameters: proteinuria ≥ 300 mg/l or ≥ 1 + on dipstick, eGFR 90. percentile (adjusted for age and gender), need for antihypertensive medication. 326 children with the diagnosis of HUS were identified. 14 were excluded due to insufficient data. 262 of 312 patients (84. 0 %) had a STEC-HUS and 50 patients (16. 0 %) an aHUS. STEC-HUS was progressively caused by non-O 157 strains. Concerning aHUS, heterogeneous aetiologies were observed. 289 patients (92. 6 %) survived the acute phase (STEC-HUS: 245 (93. 5 %), aHUS: 44 (88. 0 %)). In the long-term follow-up, renal sequelae persisted in > 40 % of patients with STEC-HUS. In the aHUS-group the rate was even higher. At the 1 -year follow-up visit, we found a significant correlation between STEC-HUS patients with antihypertensive therapy in the acute phase and persistence of renal sequelae (Gr. 1 : p = 0. 024, Gr. 2 : p = 0. 003).

This required the restructuring of legislation {{and an understanding of}} the appropriate microbiological standards by which the FSA could judge the effectiveness of the operator’s processing operation. This microbiological standard was developed following two surveys of the vast majority of registered poultry processors in NSW. These surveys demonstrated the microbiological outcomes that could be achieved by the processors. From this knowledge, a new standard for the levels of Escherichia coli (E. coli) on product were established that were to be used by the operator and the regulator to judge the effectiveness of the operator’s program. Studies into the carriage of Salmonella species on raw poultry in the plant and on the reliability of the microbiological tests being used within the survey and by industry were carried out. They found {{that there had been a}} significant reduction in carriage of Salmonella species on raw poultry from 48. 6 % to 34. 2 % over two years. The test method utilised in the survey and one utilised by the Australian industry were shown to be able to detect Salmonella Typhimurium at 1 - 3 CFU per ml of carcase rinse fluid. An examination of E. coli by PCR to determine the likelihood that E. coli carried by NSW poultry were capable of inducing Haemorrhagic Uraemic Syndrome (HUS) found no evidence of <b>shigatoxin</b> producing genes (stx 1 or stx 2) or enterohaemorrhagic E. coli specific plasmid (ehxA). The attachment factor, intimin (eaeA) was found in E. coli from 93 of 430 carcases (21. 6 %). Campylobacter species were found on 94 % of all carcases in the first survey. A count of Campylobacter species on a series of carcases from one plant found an average of 163 CFU per cm 2 on the broiler chickens tested. Because raw poultry carry pathogens from the processing plant into the wider community, the use of two post-chill sanitisers was examined. This study found that it is possible to significantly reduce the number of pathogens being carried by raw poultry. The use of post-chill sanitisers provides a potential means of reducing the risk of foodborne illness arising from the handling of raw poultry and eating undercooked poultry meat...|$|E

Higher mean rainfall was noted in areas surrounding the Skeerpoort river (74. 7 mm) than the Loskop canal (0. 1 mm). Mean temperature was 15. 4 ˚C and 18. 2 ˚C while mean pH was 7. 4 and 8. 4 in the Loskop canal and the Skeerpoort river respectively. Low mean bacterial counts of less than 3. 4 log 10 cfu/ml, were noted for ACC, ASF, AnSF, S. aureus and IE at both irrigation sites. Higher mean ACC of 5. 9 log 10 cfu/g and S. aureus counts of 3. 0 log 10 cfu/g were noted on lettuce. Although low mean counts of FC (1. 3 log 10 cfu/ 100 ml) were noted for all three sources, high incidence of E. coli was observed during bacterial composition studies on nonselective media. This suggested underestimation of faecal contamination possibly indicating that identification of specific pathogens provided a better measure of assessing bacterial contamination than bacterial indicators. E. coli, Bacillus spp and Enterobacter spp were the most prevalent bacteria in the Loskop canal, the Skeerpoort river and on lettuce. Prevalence of E. coli, Bacillus spp and Enterobacter spp in the Loskop canal was 23 %, 33 % and 26 % respectively. Similarly prevalence in the Skeerpoort river was 36 %, 26 %, 16 % respectively. On lettuce prevalence of the same bacteria was 36 %, 30 % and 6 % respectively. E. coli O 157 :H 7 was isolated at both irrigation sites while Salmonella enterica (gp 1) ST paratyphi A was isolated from the Skeerpoort river. High prevalence of similar bacterial species within the Loskop canal and the Skeerpoort river suggested similar sources of contamination in the two water sources inspite of different geographical location and surrounding land use practices. Additionally, similar bacterial species in irrigation water from the Skeerpoort river and on irrigated lettuce suggested water as a source of contamination on produce. Additionally it suggests ability of bacterial pathogens to withstand environmental conditions under field conditions which may pose a risk to food safety and public health among individuals consuming irrigated fresh produce. Phase 2 aimed at determining the prevalence of antibiotic resistant and virulent E. coli collected from the Loskop canal, the Skeerpoort river and lettuce irrigated with water from the Skeerpoort river. Forty one (41) E. coli isolates: (19) Loskop canal; (12) the Skeerpoort river; (10) lettuce were tested with 11 antibiotics at single concentrations and screened for <b>Shigatoxin</b> 1 (stx 1), <b>Shigatoxin</b> 2 (stx 2) and intimin (eae) genes. Antibiotic resistance was also used as a means of clustering E. coli isolated from the 3 sources. In the Loskop canal 84 % and 83 % of strains in the Skeerpoort river were resistant to at least one antibiotic. There was a significant difference (p≤ 0. 05) in resistance to antibiotics between isolates from the Loskop canal and the Skeerpoort river. Additionally the combined effect of isolate source (irrigation water site) and antibiotics for isolates from the Skeerpoort river was significant (p≤ 0. 05). From lettuce, 90 % of isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic and resistance significantly differed (p≤ 0. 05) from isolates in the Skeerpoort river. The highest resistance to single antibiotics in all three samples was to cephalothin and ampicillin. Higher resistance was noted to multiple (more than 2) antibiotics in the Skeerpoort river (33 %) than Loskop canal (5 %). Most isolates from the same source showed close relatedness. Close relatedness was noted between isolates from the Loksop canal (10. 5 %) and the Skeerpoort river (16 %). From irrigated lettuce 40 % of isolates showed close relatedness to isolates in irrigation water from the Skeerpoort river. In the Loskop canal 15 % and 41 % of isolates in the Skeerpoort river possessed virulence genes. From lettuce, 20 % of isolates possessed virulence genes. In the Loskop canal as well as from lettuce all isolates with virulence genes were antibiotic resistant while 80 % of isolates with virulence genes in the Skeerpoort river were antibiotic resistant. In the Loskop canal 10 % and 25 % of isolates in the Skeerpoort river were positive for stx 1 /stx 2 and eae, genes synonymous with Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). Results from this study show that E. coli from the two irrigation water sources as well as on irrigated lettuce were resistant to antibiotics and potentially pathogenic. This may increase risk of contaminating irrigated fresh produce which may compromise food safety and public health of consumers.

40|$|In der vorliegenden Arbeit sollten die für die Rezeptorbindung verantwortlichen, die C-terminalen 280 Aminosäuren umfassenden Fragmente der Intimine beta und gamma von STEC auf ihr Bindungsvermögen an bovine Lymphozyten hin untersucht werden. Zu diesem Zweck wurden die Fragmente als Fusionsproteine mit Maltose-bindendem Protein (MBP) rekombinant hergestellt und affinitätschromatographisch gereinigt. Über durchflusszytometrische und fluoreszenzmikroskopische Bindungsstudien hinaus wurden funktionelle Untersuchungen mit mitogen-stimulierten Lymphozyten durchgeführt. Dazu wurde das Proliferationsverhalten während der Inkubation der Zellen in Anwesenheit und Abwesenheit der Intimin-Fragmente durchflusszytometrisch untersucht. Die reverse Realtime-PCR diente zur Quantifizierung der Transkription ausgewählter Zytokine der TH 1 - und TH 2 -Immunreaktion. Um die Bedeutung der gewonnenen Erkenntnisse für die mukosale Immunantwort beurteilen zu können, wurden die Untersuchungen sowohl mit peripheren (PBMC) als auch mit intraepithelialen Lymphozyten aus dem Ileum (iIEL) durchgeführt. Vergleichsexperimente bestätigten, dass die gewonnenen Fusionsproteine in der Lage waren an HeLa-Zellen zu binden. Selbst unter Verwendung verschiedener Nachweissysteme konnte eine Bindung der Intiminfragmente an bovine PBMC oder iIEL jedoch nicht nachgewiesen werden. Das Fehlen von Intiminrezeptoren auf bovinen Lymphozyten wurde auch durch die funktionellen Untersuchungen bestätigt. So beeinflussten die Intiminfragmente weder die Proliferation mitogen-stimulierter PBMC noch die Transkription der untersuchten Zytokin-Gene. Diese Ergebnisse unterstützen die Hypothese, dass bovine Lymphozyten gegenüber einer kostimulatorischen Aktivität von Intiminen anerg sind. Dies stellt einen weiteren Schritt zum Verständnis der molekularen Mechanismen dar, mit denen STEC die Darmschleimhaut von Rindern {{persistent}} kolonisieren können. Ruminants -especially adult cattle- are asymptomatically and persistently {{infected by}} <b>Shigatoxin</b> producing Escherichia coli (STEC) that colonize the intestine in commensal-like fashion. An important prerequisite for persistent infections {{may be a}} lack of inflammatory reactions of the host organism. During the process of colonization, bacterial intimins cause a tight adhesion between the pathogen and the epithelial cell. In mice, intimins also act as a costimulus and induce an inflammation of the TH 1 type during T-cell activation. Thus, the persistent type of STEC induced infection in cattle {{may be related to}} the intimin´s failure to act as costimulus. Therefore, the aim of this investigation was to elucidate the binding capacity of the COOH-terminal 280 amino acids that represent the intimin-receptor-binding domain on eukaryotic cells. Recombinant engineering was performed in order to construct a fusion protein consisting of a maltose binding protein (MBP) and the 280 amino acids of the carboxy terminus of different intimin subtypes. FPLC served to purify the created fusion proteins. In addition to flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy, functional assays with mitogen stimulated lymphocytes were accomplished. For this purpose, proliferation of the incubated cells in presence and absence of the intimin fragments was analyzed cytometrically. RT realtime-PCR was applied to quantify the transcription of certain cytokines of TH 1 - and TH 2 -type immune response. To properly interpret the achieved results concerning the mucosal immune response, experiments were done with bovine mononuclear cells of the peripheral blood as well as with intraepithelial cells extracted from the ileum (iIEL). It was shown that -in contrast to cells of bovine origin- the purified fusion proteins were able to bind to HeLa cells under the same conditions. Despite the use of different detection systems no proof of binding between the intimin fragments and bovine PBMC and IEL, respectively, could be given. Functional assays confirmed the lack of bovine lymphocyte intimin receptors as well. Therefore, the intimin fragments influenced neither the proliferating mitogen- stimulated PBMC nor the transcription of the evaluated cytokine genes. These results confirm the hypothesis of bovine lymphocytes being anergic to the costimulatory activity of intimins and thus presenting a further contribution to the understanding of molecular mechanisms responsible for persistent colonization of STEC on the bovine intestinal mucosa...|$|E
40|$|Persistent infizierte Rinder sind das wichtigste Reservoir für humanpathogene Shigatoxin-bildende E. coli. Da Lymphozyten aus dem peripheren Blut von Rindern sensitiv für <b>Shigatoxin</b> 1 (Stx 1) sind, sollte in dieser Arbeit der Frage nachgegangen werden, ob Stx 1 über eine Modulation der spezifischen Immunzellen in der intestinalen Mukosa die Persistenz der bovinen STEC-Infektion begünstigt. Zu diesem Zweck wurden intraepitheliale Lymphozyten (IEL) aus dem Ileum von Rindern ex vivo bezüglich ihrer Oberflächenantigene charakterisiert. Insbesondere wurden die Zellen durchflusszytometrisch auf die Expression von Stx 1 -Rezeptoren (Gb 3 /CD 77) sowie die Fähigkeit zur Bindung der B-Untereinheit des Toxins untersucht und die Zusammensetzung der IEL-Subpopulationen mit der aus Zäkum und Kolon verglichen. In vitro wurde der Einfluss von gereinigtem Stx 1 auf die Transformation ilealer IEL zu Blasten und die Aktivität Natürlicher Killerzellen ermittelt. Schließlich wurde die Transkription verschiedener Zytokingene, die für eine TH 1 - bzw. TH 2 -Immunantwort typisch sind bzw. chemotaktische Eigenschaften haben, in An- und Abwesenheit von Stx 1 unter Verwendung einer semiquantitativen rt-PCR miteinander verglichen. Bovine IEL exprimierten sowohl direkt nach ihrer Isolierung als auch nach 3 tägiger Inkubation den Stx 1 -Rezeptor Gb 3 /CD 77 auf allen IEL-Subpopulationen. Die Expression funktioneller Stx 1 -Rezeptoren wurde durch die Fähigkeit zur Bindung von rStxB 1 bestätigt. Die Zusammensetzung der IEL in Zäkum und Kolon unterschied sich nur geringfügig von der ilealer IEL. Letztere wiesen einen geringfügig höheren Anteil von B-Zellen und CD 4 + T-Zellen zu Lasten der CD 8 + und der gamma-delta T-Zellen auf. In allen untersuchten Darmabschnitten konnten jedoch Gb 3 /CD 77 + IEL nachgewiesen werden. In Anwesenheit von Stx 1 zeigten die IEL eine verminderte Vitalität und Transformationsrate. Obwohl bestimmte IEL-Subpopulationen nach 3 Tagen Inkubation mit Stx 1 Gb 3 /CD 77 zu einem höheren Prozentsatz exprimierten als andere (CD 4 +, CD 21 +), waren alle Zellen gleichermaßen von der Stx 1 -induzierten Reduktion der Transformation und des Anteils vitaler non-Blasten betroffen. Stx 1 beeinflusste die Natürliche Killerzell-Aktivität boviner IEL zwar nicht, hatte aber eine modulierende Wirkung auf die Produktion von spezifischer Zytokin-mRNA. Der Effekt von Stx 1 auf die Transkription von IL- 2, IL- 10 und Interferon-gamma war bei IEL-Präparationen von verschiedenen Tieren individuell unterschiedlich. Allerdings konnte sowohl bei unstimulierten als auch bei PHA-P-stimulierten Zellen in der Mehrzahl der Präparationen nach Inkubation mit Stx 1 eine verstärkte Transkription von IL- 4 nachgewiesen werden. Gleichzeitig wurde die Produktion von IL- 8 mRNA reduziert. Bei der persistenten intestinalen Infektion von Rindern mit STEC stellen Zellen der lokalen spezifischen Immunabwehr somit Zielzellen für Stx 1 dar. Da IEL Bestandteil des komplexen regulatorischen Netzwerks der intestinalen Mukosa sind, könnte Stx 1 von den STEC dazu genutzt werden, die intestinale Homöostase auch in Anwesenheit pathogener Mikroorganismen aufrechtzuerhalten und damit sowohl histopathologisch nachweisbare Schäden zu vermeiden als auch die Persistenz der bovinen STEC-Infektion zu ermöglichen. Persistently {{infected}} ruminants are {{the main}} reservoir of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli which can be pathogenic for humans. Since bovine PBMC are sensitive to Shiga toxin (Stx 1), {{the goal of this}} study was to investigate if modulation of intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytic function by Stx 1 supported persistent bovine STEC infection. The expression of cell surface antigens on isolated ileal IEL was examined using flow cytometry. The expression of the toxin receptor Gb 3 /CD 77, the binding of rStxB 1 to IEL, and differences between the lymphocyte subpopulations of ileum, cecum and colon were all investigated. The influence of Stx 1 on the ileal IEL transformation to blast cells and the activity of natural killer cells were also examined by flow cytometry. Additionally, the transcription of TH 1 or TH 2 cytokines/chemokines, and the chemotactic properties of these molecules were investigated in the absence and presence of Stx 1 by semiquantitative rt-PCR. After three days of in vitro incubation with Stx 1, all bovine IEL subpopulations expressed Gb 3 /CD 77 on their surfaces. The binding of rStxB 1 on some IEL subpopulations proved that the receptor was functional. When ileal IEL were compared to IEL isolated from cecum and colon, no significant differences in the composition of lymphocyte subpopulations were observed. Ileal IEL revealed a marginal increase in CD 4 + T-cells and B-cells in combination with a decrease in CD 8 + and gamma-delta T-cells. Independent of their source, all IEL expressed Gb 3 /CD 77 on their surface. After incubation with Stx 1, CD 77 was also still expressed on every IEL subpopulation analysed, but the percentage of cells that had transformed to blast cells and the viability of these cells was markedly decreased compared to the control. Although some IEL subpopulations expressed CD 77 at a higher percentage than the other subpopulations analyzed (CD 4 +, CD 21 +), the Stx 1 -dependent decrease of transformed blast cells and viable non-blast cells could be detected in each lymphocyte subpopulation. The transcription pattern of selected cytokine/chemokine genes was changed in the presence of Stx 1. This modulation was heterogeneous for interleukin 2, interleukin 10 and interferon-gamma, suggesting a correlation to the individual state of activation of every animal studied. Interestingly, the transcription of the interleukin 4 gene was increased in most resting and activated cells while the transcription of interleukin 8 was decreased. In contrast to the Stx 1 -induced changes in gene transcription and transformation obtained from IEL, the activity of natural killer cells was not influenced by the toxin. IEL, as a component of the local intestinal specific immune defence, seem to be a potential target for Stx 1. Since IEL are a part of the complex regulatory network of the intestinal mucosa, it seems possible that STEC utilise Stx 1 to maintain the intestinal homeostasis. This may prevent the histopathologic damage caused by pathogenic bacteria and allow persistent STEC infection in ruminants...|$|E
