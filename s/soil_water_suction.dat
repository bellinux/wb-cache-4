Merrill, var. Chippewa 64) seedlings was studied. A special apparatus {{was developed in}} which the <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> of several cells with soybeans growing in them could be maintained independently at a selected temperature. Transpiration was determined by a constant-water level device which recorded {{the amount of water}} used over a period of time. Photosynthesis and respiration were measured using an infra-red gas analyzer. The total nitrogen content of plants was measured by the micro-Kjeldahl method {{at the beginning and end}} of a ten-day experimental period. Leaf surface areas were determined with an air flow planimeter. In general with increasing soil temperature rates of transpiration, photosynthesis, and nitrogen fixation increased slowly at first and then rapidly until a certain optimum range was reached and decreased at higher temperatures. Maximum rates occurred around soil temperatures, of 30, 27 and 27 °C, respectively. The rate of respiration also increased with increasing soil temperature until an optimum range around 27 °C was reached and then dropped rapidly as the soil temperature further increased. Rates of photosynthesis, respiration, transpiration and N-fixation decreased steadily with increasing <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>suction.</b> The decrease in the rate of these metabolic processes with increased <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> was attributed to effects of changes in viscosity and root cell permeability, stomatal movement and translocation of metabolic substrates. At low soil temperatures the dry matter accumulation seemed to be controlled by the water supply. At higher than optimum soil temperatures the dry dry matter accumulation was very sensitive-to temperature changes and less soil water dependent. When the nitrogen supply from the soil is limiting, the nitrogen fixation may possibly be a most important factor in the metabolic processes and thus the growth of leguminous plants. It is obvious that for such a plant, soil water availability, soil temperature and nodule rhyzobium organism-plant relationships are important...|$|E
40|$|The montane {{rain forest}} belt on Mt Kilimanjaro forms an {{important}} water source for northern Tanzania that {{is threatened by}} both logging and fire. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the consequences of forest fragmentation on various aspects of the water cycle. Soil properties, rainfall, throughfall and <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> were analysed for mature forest, secondary forest patches and large clearings. A total of 10 plots located on the south-western slopes of the mountain between 2100 and 2300 m. a. s. l. were monitored from May 2000 to June 2002. Annual rainfall amounts ranged from 2000 to 2600 mm with high spatial and inter-annual variability. Rainfall interception ranged from 3 to 9 % of incident rainfall in clearings, to a maximum of 32 % in forests. In general, soils under mature forest were wettest and showed only minor moisture fluctuations throughout the year. Soils of secondary forest sites were driest and <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> exhibited the largest fluctuations. Additionally, the finer texture of soils under mature forest compared to secondary forest sites allowed higher amounts of soil water to be stored for similar <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> levels. Ventilation and radiation penetration, which influence the magnitude of interception, evaporation from the forest floor and transpiration, were probably higher in fragmented secondary than in closed mature forests. In clearings, higher throughfall and presumably lower transpiration rates led to moister conditions compared to adjacent secondary forest sites. Thus, soil conditions under mature forest were most suitable for optimum water storage on Mt Kilimanjaro. The transformation of closed mature forest to a mosaic of forests in different stages of regeneration led to increased spatio-temporal variability in soil moisture.

40|$|Individual {{effect of}} {{different}} field scale management interventions for water saving in rice viz. changing date of transplanting, cultivar and irrigation schedule on yield, water saving and water productivity {{is well documented}} in the literature. However, {{little is known about}} their integrated effect. To study that, field experimentation and modeling approach was used. Field experiments were conducted for 2 years (2006 and 2007) at Punjab Agricultural University Farm, Ludhiana on a deep alluvial loamy sand Typic Ustipsamment soils developed under hyper-thermic regime. Treatments included three dates of transplanting (25 May, 10 June and 25 June), two cultivars (PR 118 inbred and RH 257 hybrid) and two irrigation schedules (2 -days drainage period and at <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> of 16 kPa). The model used was CropSyst, which has already been calibrated for growth (periodic biomass and LAI) of rice and soil water content in two independent experiments. The main findings of the field and simulation studies conducted are compared to any individual, integrated management of transplanting date, cultivar and irrigation, sustained yield (6. 3 - 7. 5 tha- 1) and saved substantial amount of water in rice. For example, with two management interventions, i. e. shifting of transplanting date to lower evaporative demand (from 5 May to 25 June) concomitant with growing of short duration hybrid variety (90 days from transplanting to harvest), the total real water saving (wet saving) through reduction in evapotranspiration (ET) was 140 mm, which was almost double than managing the single, i. e. 66 mm by shifting transplanting or 71 mm by growing short duration hybrid variety. Shifting the transplanting date saved water through reduction in soil water evaporation component while growing of short duration variety through reduction in both evaporation and transpiration components of water balance. Managing irrigation water schedule based on <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> of 16 kPa at 15 - 20 cm soil depth, compared to 2 -day drainage, did not save water in real (wet saving), however, it resulted into apparent water saving (dry saving).

[(soybean–wheat (S–W), soybean–lentil (S–L) and soybean–pea (S–P) ] on pore size distribution and soil hydraulic conductivities [saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity {k(h) }] of a sandy clay loam soil was studied after 4 {{years prior to the}} experiment. Soil cores were collected after 4 year of the experiment at an interval of 75 mm up to 300 mm soil depth for measuring soil bulk density, <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> retention constant (b), pore size distribution, Ksat and k(h). Nine pressure levels (from 2 to 1500 kPa) were used to calculate pore size distribution and k(h). It was observed that b values at all the studied soil depths were higher under ZT than those observed under CT irrespective of the crop rotations. The values of soil bulk density observed under ZT were higher in 0 – 75 mm soil depth in all the crop rotations. But, among the crop rotations, soils under S–P and S–L rotations showed relatively lower bulk density values than S–W rotation. Average values of the volume fraction of total porosity with pores 150 μm in diameter (pores draining freely with gravity) were 0. 124, 0. 096 and 0. 095 m 3 m− 3 under CT, MT and ZT; and 0. 110, 0. 104 and 0. 101 m 3 m− 3 under S–W, S–L and S–P, respectively.

Plant yield, nitrogen and sulphur uptake and amount of S-urea mineralized were studied. The optimum conditions for ryegrass growth appeared to vary due to the interaction between soil temperature and moisture status. Increasing root temperature indicated a higher soil moisture content was required for optimum ryegrass growth. High soil temperature and low <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> decreased the percent plant nitrogen in 31 -day old seedlings.

40|$|Studying {{the soil}} {{moisture}} distribution {{over time in}} a given soil profile {{is the object of}} the present study. The way the soil moisture gets distributed over soil profile depends particularly on the soil texture and on the soil suction gradients developed. However, it changes continuously over time for a given soil depth. The method of determining the soil moisture distribution over time is based on the measuring of soil moisture suctions developed and the soil moisture contents in various times, but in a given soil depth (internal drainage method) [7]. The soil depths under investigation are four, starting from 0 cm to 60 cm, which means that the most important depth of soil profile is considered. Such measurements are supposed to be done over soil profile when the soil water flow is already ceased, in the conditions of preventing the evaporation [1, 7, and 9]. Therefore, to determine the soil moisture distribution over time, a plot of 8 m x 6 m or 48 m 2 with no plants was set. The tensiometers and the electronic devices for soil moisture content measurements were installed in four soil depths. The plot was previously wetted and covered by a plastic to prevent the evaporation. In this way, it was made sure that the only possibility for water is to move internally, which gave us the opportunity to measure the changes in soil water content and in <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> over time.

40|$|Pristine peatlands are {{accumulators}} {{of organic}} material and large stores of carbon. During {{the past two}} centuries, large peatland areas in Sweden have been drained for agricultural purposes. Drainage of peatlands leads {{to an increase in}} soil carbon and nitrogen turnover rate, accompanied by release of the greenhouse gases (GHG), carbon dioxide (CO 2) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). Fluxes of methane (CH 4) also change following drainage. Therefore, on-farm management and mitigation strategies are important. This thesis investigated whether choice of cropping system (grassland, cereals or row crops) {{can be used as a}} mitigation option for GHG emissions, whether differences in soil properties can explain emissions of GHG, how changes in drainage intensity influence CO 2 emissions and whether different peat soil types respond differently to drainage. Effects of different cropping systems were studied by on-site measurements of GHG emissions from soil under two different crops grown adjacent to each other, and hence with the same soil type, drainage intensity and environmental conditions. The study was performed on 11 different sites representing different types of organic soils. The influence of drainage and chemical and physical soil properties was investigated in a laboratory study where 13 different organic soils were drained to different <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>suctions</b> (near water-saturated to 1. 5 m water column) and emissions of CO 2 were measured at each suction step. The results show that no specific cropping system can be recommended as a better option for limiting GHG emissions from cultivated organic soils. The cropping system did not influence the fluxes of N 2 O and CH 4, while the differences regarding carbon dioxide emissions were not conclusive. The laboratory soil samples represented a wide range of soil properties, but none of the measured properties was correlated with CO 2 emissions. When peat soils were drained to 0. 5 m water column, CO 2 production was already at its highest level, so increasing the drainage intensity (to 0. 75 or 1 m water column) did not result in higher CO 2 emissions. The variations in GHG emissions were large between sites, within sites and over time. Soil properties, e. g. pH and carbon content, varied widely between soils. The peat soils studied responded differently to drainage, as was evident from the shape of the emissions-drainage curves...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{greenhouse}} investigation was to test a multichannel oxygen flux meter (Fig. 7) which was first designed by Armstrong & Wright (1976). The aim was to determine values of oxygen diffusion rate (ODR) critical {{for the growth of}} summer rape in two different clay soils from the middle part of Sweden (Table 1). A further aim was to study the effects of irrigation and soil compaction on ODR and to measure redoxpotential in the two soils. Undisturbed soil samples were extracted from the soil surface in steel cylinders with a height of 10 cm and a diameter of 7. 2 cm. Different <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>suctions</b> were applied to the samples and summer rape was sown on a number of cylinders. ODR was measured with a bare platinum electrode which was forced into the soil to a depth of 1. 5 cm. A reference silver electrode was also lightly but firmly pressed into the soil. The leads from the two electrodes were connected to the oxygen flux meter which maintained an effective voltage of 0. 65 V across the electrodes. An electric current resulted from the reduction of oxygen at the platinum surface and was assumed to be proportional to ODR in the surrounding soil solution (lemon & Erickson, 1952). The current was allowed to flow for 4 minutes before a reading was taken. In an initial experiment (Fig. 9) it was concluded that the steel cylinder would have no measurable disturbing effect on the current. The same pair of electrodes was used to register the redoxpotential of the soil sample, but in this measurement no voltage was applied to the system. ODR values greatly varied within as well as between soil samples, probably due to the heterogenicy of soil (lemon & Erickson, 1952). Despite this, the statistical significance of an increase in ODR values with a decrease in water content was high for most samples studied (Tables 4 and 6). In general, low ODR values were obtained as a result of irrigation (Diagrams 14 - 20) and soil compaction (Diagrams 5 - 6 and 9 - 10). There was a tendency for ODR to increase with increase in redoxpotential (Diagrams 23 - 24). Despite the low ODR values of ten obtained (less than 2 pmol m- 2 s-l) the growth of rape was normal in all noncompacted samples (Diagrams 25 - 26). This was probably due to the high percentage of roots growing on the outer surface of the sample next to the cylinder wall, where the oxygen supply was assumed to be more adequate than inside the soil sample. Because of this, {{it was not possible to}} determine a critical ODR value for the growth of summer rape in these samples. Regarding the results obtained from this investigation, it can be Concluded that the ODR method is a good indicator of soil aeration status and a complement to other existing methods of measuring soil aeration...|$|R

Experimental catchment Uhlíˇrská (1. 78 km 2) is formed by Paleozoic crystalline bedrock overlaid by shallow highly permeable cambisol on the hillslopes, whereas the thick saturated glacial deposits in the valley are overlaid by histosols. Standard meteorological and hydrological monitoring is supplemented by measurements of the soil moisture, <b>soil</b> pore <b>water</b> <b>suction,</b> <b>water</b> table ﬂuctuation in the saturated riparian zone of ˇ Cerná Nisa creek. Isotopes in water molecule 18 O, 2 H and 3 H are analyzed in precipitation, shallow groundwater, <b>soil</b> pore <b>water,</b> groundwater and stream outﬂow to select proper hypothesis about the ﬂow formation. Complementary sampling for the Li-isotopes (δ 7 Li) was performed {{in the period of}} 2008 - 2010 on the monthly basis in precipitation, shallow groundwater and outﬂow waters. Lithium contents ﬂuctuate signiﬁcantly between the precipitation (mean: 0. 35 ± 0. 21 µg/l), the shallow ground¬water (mean: 1. 87 ± 0. 23 µg/l) and the outﬂow (mean: 3. 10 ± 0. 36 µg/l). There is no link between the Li contents and the rainfall amount but a positive trend can be seen between Li contents and the outﬂow discharge. First set of Li-isotopes data shows an increase in the δ 7 Li between the precipitation (mean: + 5. 6 ± 2. 7 %¸), the shallow groundwater (mean: + 13. 9 ± 4. 4 %¸) and the outﬂow (mean: + 18. 4 ± 3. 5 %¸). There is no evidence of link between the δ 7 Li and the Li contents (as 1 /Li) revealing no simple mixing. Comparing the data reveal causalities between content of lithium isotopes in precipitation, shallow groundwater in wetlands and outﬂow from the catchment and prove that naturally present lithium isotopes can be a very useful tool in hydrological tracing.

However, in the mesh bags, the total assimilation of N- 15 by EMF was almost halved by N fertilization, while twice as much N- 15 leached through. We found a high specific N assimilation capacity per unit weight of EMF mycelia. This was unaffected by N fertilization, but the total assimilation of N by EMF was drastically reduced due to reduced production of EMM.

40|$|The use {{and quality}} of {{prediction}} of simulation models depends {{to a great extent}} on the availability of enough input data of good quality. In civil engineering calculations are often made on saturated, unstructured soils. Dikes are mainly situated far above groundwater levels and therefore clay soils in and on dikes are often dry and well structured. This has a major impact on material properties of clay soils. This report presents an inventory of soil physical characteristics as used in agricultural research for use in civil engineering. In Chapter 2 the water retention characteristics and conductivity characteristics of Dutch soils collected in the "Staringreeks" are presented. The water retention characteristic is the relation of soil water content versus <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>suction.</b> The conductivity characteristic is the relation of the <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> versus the unsaturated conductivity. The "Staringreeks" is constructed by Alterra, Wageningen UR, the Netherlands, and presents the average water retention and conductivity characteristics of 36 Dutch soil texture classes (Wösten et al., 2001). The series is based on 832 soil horizons. Beside these average soil physical characteristics of the 36 Dutch soil texture classes also continue functions are presented which make it possible to calculate the soil physical characteristics based on organic mater content, clay content, loam content (= clay + silt content), subsoil or topsoil, and bulk density. The water retention and conductivity characteristics of clay soils in the "Staringreeks" are compared with measured characteristics of clay soils of the dike along the river Lek nearby Bergambacht. The soil physical characteristics of the agricultural soils in the "Staringreeks" prove to be different from the measured soil physical characteristics of the clay soils of the dike. Hysteresis of the water retention characteristic is considered. In chapter 3 shrinkage of clay soils is considered. In the unsaturated zone shrinkage and the resulting soil cracks have a crucial role in preferential flow of water and solutes to groundwater. In summer and most time of winter groundwater levels in dikes are far below the upper clay layers of the dike. Therefore usually clay in and on dikes becomes much dryer and structured than clay soils in Dutch agriculture. Consequently shrinkage of clay will be even more important in dikes than in agricultural soils. In chapter 4 conclusions are drawn...|$|E
40|$|Soil {{texture and}} {{evaporative}} demand {{have been reported}} to be the main factors which influence the transpirational response to soil water deficits. However, experimental evidences are not enough. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the transpirational response to soil water availability in soils of different textures under different evaporative demand levels. The three main soils of the Loess Plateau of China (loamy clay, clay loam and sandy loam) were selected and six constant soil water treatments were applied for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L) grown in pots. In order to reduce the influence of environmental conditions and plant factors, a normalized daily transpiration rate was used to develop the relationships with volumetric soil water content and <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>suction.</b> Results showed that, under various levels of evaporative demand, a linear-plateau function with a critical value could be used to describe the dynamic change of the normalized transpiration rate with soil drying. Soil texture significantly influenced both the critical and the slope values of the linear-plateau equations, however, evaporative demand significantly affected the critical values of volumetric soil water content and soil suction for the loamy clay and clay loam only. Therefore, for saving water, different strategies are needed for these three soils. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Volume {{change of}} soils {{may be caused}} either by {{external}} (mechanical) or internal (hydraulic) stresses {{or a combination of}} both. A complete description of volume change must therefore include both mechanical and hydraulic stresses. By combining theories of mechanical and hydraulic stress states, a hydraulic function, which predicts the change of water volume {{as a function of the}} stress state parameter <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> (water retention curve), is adopted to model volume change. The utilization of such a continuous function also enables the derivation of soil mechanical parameters (e. g., preconsolidation stress, Youngs modulus) by determining mathematically the point of maximum curvature and inflection point. This information can then be used to calculate the preconsolidation stress according to the method of Casagrande. The presented calculation has considerable advantages compared with the graphic method of Casagrande or other methods. On the basis of stress–strain relationships of various textured and structured soils and soil substrates and various test procedures (oedometer test, triaxial test, shrinkage test), volume change is modeled using the described method. It is shown that modeling volume change by the van Genuchten equation using the software RETC is possible with high accuracy. Soil mechanical parameters are derived using the parameters of the van Genuchten equation. The comparison of results of this method with the Casagrande and a statistical method shows that these methods have deficiencies when the data sets have a high variability, the samples are not homogeneous, and when the stress–strain curve is flat. The accuracy of the mathematical method in contrast is very high and the calculated preconsolidation stress very reliable...|$|E

However, when the <b>water</b> <b>suction</b> was beyond 5  kPa, the volumetric water content of the reclaimed farmland decreased very quickly to a low level and was less than that of the unaltered farmland. For most soils, field capacity was estimated at the water potential of –  10 to −  33  kPa (Brady and Weil 2008). The volumetric water content of the surface soil and subsoil of the reclaimed farmland began to be less than that of the unaltered farmland after the field capacity was reached, while the volumetric water content of the substratum soil of the reclaimed farmland started to be less than that of the unaltered farmland before the field capacity was reached, indicating that the substratum soil (sediment) of the reclaimed farmland drained water very quickly and had low capacity to retain water. There was difference in the shape and range in <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> characteristic curve of the two kinds of sampling sites shown in Fig.  4, which may be due to that there was more clay content in the surface soil, subsoil and substratum soil of the unaltered farmland than that of the reclaimed farmland, respectively, as shown in Table  1.

40|$|Agricultural {{cultivation}} and seeding practices often leave a "layered" seedbed structure. Layering {{is assumed}} to reduce evaporative losses from the soil surface. In this study, the effect of layering on temperature and water content variations in a clay soil was investigated. Soil columns 150 mm in height and 200 mm diameter were prepared with four different layering configurations, and three different initial water contents, and allowed to dry for {{a week in a}} controlled environment. Settings in the growth chamber were 15 °C and 44 % relative humidity for 16 hours and 5 °C and 85 % relative humidity for 8 hours. Temperature and water content in different layers of the soil column were monitored continuously. Statistical analysis of the data revealed that layering had a significant effect on moisture retention in soil columns with low initial water contents, while no effect or even increased moisture losses were found in soils with high initial water contents. Layering had no effect on temperature variations in the soil columns. A pressure-based coupled heat and mass transfer model was developed to simulate temperature and <b>soil</b> <b>water</b> pressure (<b>suction)</b> in a layered soil profile. A finite difference formulation of the model was solved using a FORTRAN 77 computer code. Model predictions were compared with experimental data. The model predicted the water content (MRPD values ranged from 2. 1 % to 7. 7 %) and temperature (MRPD values ranged from 0. 60 % to 0. 77 %) with reasonably low deviations from the measured values. The model showed very high sensitivity to the proposed hydraulic conductivity function, while lower sensitivity was found for the proposed thermal conductivity function. For practical purposes in the clay soil tested, layering may be desirable for low initial water content conditions, while in higher water contents, stratification may have an adverse effect on moisture retention. Verification of the model for field conditions is left for future studies...|$|R
