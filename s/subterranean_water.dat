25|$|On {{the hill}} forming {{the base of}} the El Duende group were erected several stelae {{containing}} toponym glyphs. One of these glyphs refers to water and the cave contains an underground lake directly underneath the hill, making it likely that the toponym is referring to this particular body of water. The fact that the ElDuende group were originally named after this <b>subterranean</b> <b>water</b> source demonstrates how important this cave was to the ancient inhabitants of DosPilas.|$|E
25|$|For {{thousands}} of years, the Jenolan {{area has been}} part of the culture of local indigenous peoples. The area holds significance to the Gundungurra and Wiradjuri peoples, who knew it as Binomil or Bin-oo-mur, and a variety of similar names. A Dreamtime creation story of the Gundungurra people describes how the countryside came into being, and involves a struggle between two ancestral creator spirits – one a giant eel-like creature, Gurangatch, and the other, Mirrigan, a large native cat or quoll. The Gundungurra people penetrated the caves as far as the <b>subterranean</b> <b>water,</b> carrying sick people to be bathed in this water, which they believed to have curative powers.|$|E
25|$|The {{partners}} supplied {{their own}} tools; and {{were responsible for}} their upkeep. Many important responsibilities lay with the partners; thus, for instance, only two overseers were needed to manage more than 200 Leadhills’ miners. In {{the absence of an}} overseer’s constant and immediate personal supervision, the partners were totally responsible for their collective work practices and occupational safety; thus, the partners, rather than overseers, would decide how to act against threats posed by <b>subterranean</b> <b>water,</b> loose ground, earth tremors, etc. However, with no overseer, there was also no oversight; and, often, hastily constructed passages/shafts were misaligned with those of other teams, affecting the structure of the entire mine — also, the disposal of waste and rubbish from one team’s work area often impeded the progress of another team (or teams).|$|E

500|$|Since {{the mid-19th}} century a private company, the Spring Valley Water Company (SVWC), owned much of the Alameda Creek Watershed and had held a {{monopoly}} on water service to San Francisco. In 1906, William Bowers Bourn II, a major stockholder in the SVWC, {{and owner of the}} giant Empire gold mine, hired Willis Polk to design a [...] "water temple" [...] atop the spot where three <b>subterranean</b> <b>water</b> sources converge (a pipe from the Arroyo de la Laguna, Alameda Creek, through the Sunol infiltration galleries, and a 30-inch pipeline from the artesian well field of Pleasanton) [...] Some sources claim Bourn wanted to sell the water company to the City of San Francisco and saw the temple as a way to appeal to San Francisco voters, who would have to approve the purchase (municipal efforts to buy out the SVWC had been a source of constant controversy from as early as 1873, when the first attempt to purchase it was turned down by the voters because the price was too high). Other sources claim that as one born into wealth and classically educated, Bourn was partially motivated by a sense of civic responsibility.|$|E

60|$|From {{a letter}} of Feuerbach of September 20, 1828, we learn that Kaspar, 'without being an albino,' can see as well in utter {{darkness}} as in daylight. Perhaps the man who taught Kaspar to write, in the dark, was an albino: Kaspar never saw his face. Kaspar's powers of vision abated, as he took to beef, but he remained hyperæsthetic, and could see better in a bad light than Daumer or Feuerbach. Some 'dowsers,' we know, can detect <b>subterranean</b> <b>water,</b> by the sensations of their hands, without using a twig, or divining rod, and others can 'spot' gold hidden under the carpet, with the twig. Kaspar, merely with the bare hand, detected (without touching it?) a needle under a table cloth. He gradually lost these gifts, and the theory {{seems to have been}} that they were the result of his imprisonment in the dark, and a proof of it. The one thing certain is that Kaspar had the sensitive or 'mediumistic' temperament, which usually--though not always--is accompanied by hysteria, while hysteria means cunning and fraud, whether conscious or not so conscious. Meanwhile the boy was in the hands of men credulous, curious, and, in the case of Daumer, capable of odd sensations induced by suggestion. From such a boy, in such company, the truth could not be expected, above all if, like some other persons of his class, he was subject to 'dissociation' and obliviousness as to his own past.|$|E

40|$|The {{study of}} the cephalic capsule of Caecosphaeroma burgundum, a <b>subterranean</b> <b>waters</b> Isopod, {{demonstrates}} improved adaptations to volvation; these concern {{in a similar manner}} the other regions of the body, particularly the pleotelson. From a primitive aquatic Isopod structure, the head of this blind Spheromid has been completely fashioned by many mechanical factors: posterior margin of pleotelson providing support on the head, relation of anterior angles of the second pereionit and, above all, the mandibular palps and antennae which retract into two deep grooves of the face. The comparative {{study of the}} head of other volvational Isopods shows the importance of that “antennary factor”, e. g. in Oniscoids, epigean Spheromids and some other <b>subterranean</b> <b>waters</b> Isopods (two Spheromids and one Cirolanid). This comparison shows that Caecosphaeroma burgundum is certainly the most specialized of all; it approaches perfection in volvation for it is the only one which rolls up into a hermetic sphere without outwards projections. Volvation seems to play a two-fold role. It is a mean of defence against predators used by single specimens and by copulating pairs, males and females being then associated in two concentric spheres. Furthermore, it is a very important way for passive dissemination allowing settlement of these Crustacea in distant <b>subterranean</b> <b>waters...</b>|$|R
