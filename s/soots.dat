Their [...] "Memories of El Monte" [...] was {{recorded by the}} Penguins, although only Cleve Duncan of the original group was featured. Buff owned the small Pal Recording Studio in Cucamonga, which included a unique five-track tape recorder he had built. At that time, {{only a handful of}} the most sophisticated commercial studios had multi-track facilities; the industry standard for smaller studios was still mono or two-track. Although none of the recordings from the period achieved major commercial success, Zappa earned enough money to allow him to stage a concert of his orchestral music in 1963 and to broadcast and record it. He appeared on Steve Allen's syndicated late night show the same year, in which he played a bicycle as a musical instrument. Using a bow borrowed from the band's bass player, as well as drum sticks, he proceeded to pluck, bang, and bow the spokes of the bike, producing strange, comical sounds from his new found instrument.

40|$|In {{order to}} reveal the <b>soot</b> removal {{mechanism}} in Electric Diesel Particulate Trap (E-DPT), mechanism of <b>soot</b> trapping and re-burning of <b>soot</b> particles in exhaust gas was investigated using one channel electric diesel particulate trap (1 channel E-DPT). The E-DPT is capable to trap <b>soot</b> particles by applying DC electric field between electro-plates. The results showed that <b>soot</b> particles like a whisker grew up from negative electrode side toward positive one. <b>Soot</b> particles trapped on the plates formed many <b>soot</b> bridges in narrow space between electro-plates. Formation of <b>soot</b> particles depended on electric intensity. In the condition of F= 200 kV/m, lumps of <b>soot</b> were observed instead of whisker like <b>soot</b> bridges and <b>soot</b> trapping and <b>soot</b> re-burning were balanced.

The model was validated in a constant volume spray combustion chamber by comparing the predicted <b>soot</b> volume fraction (SVF), mean primary <b>soot</b> diameter and primary <b>soot</b> size distribution to the experimental data of n-heptane and n-dodecane spray combustion. The inception, surface growth and oxidation models were adopted and modified from the multistep Moss-Brookes (MB) <b>soot</b> model, which was used in this study as the representative of Eulerian <b>soot</b> model. Parametric studies were carried out to investigate the influence of <b>soot</b> surface ageing and oxidation rates on the overall <b>soot</b> formation. Following the parametric study, the developed LST model which incorporated surface ageing effect and higher oxidation rates was implemented to investigate the effect of ambient oxygen and density on <b>soot</b> morphology in n-heptane spray flame. The LST model was shown to have better primary <b>soot</b> size prediction capability while still maintaining comparable performance in predicting SVF with respect to its Eulerian counterpart. The SVF distributions predicted by the LST model qualitatively correspond to the experimental results despite the peak <b>soot</b> location being predicted further downstream by 30 mm.

40|$|The {{measurement}} of <b>soot</b> and <b>soot</b> precursors {{is important for}} understanding the formation of <b>soot</b> particles in flames. In this paper, we use the difference between laserinduced incandescence (LII) and two-dimensional extinction measurements to assess the contribution of <b>soot</b> precursors to the extinction measurement.

While LII is specific to mature <b>soot</b> only, the extinction data represent attenuation due to mature and young <b>soot</b> (absorption and elastic scattering) and also absorption by <b>soot</b> precursors. The {{difference between the two}} measurements indicates the contribution of <b>soot</b> precursors and allows a determination of the maturity of <b>soot.</b> This is important knowledge for those using extinction techniques to measure <b>soot</b> concentration, as the contribution from <b>soot</b> precursors may lead to an overestimation of the mature <b>soot</b> concentration.

In place of having the same white vapour that you had before, you will now have a black vapour. There it goes, as black as ink. It is certainly very different from the white vapour; and when we put a light to it, we shall find that it does not burn, but that it puts the light out. Well, these particles, as I said before, are just the smoke of the candle; and this brings to mind that old employment which Dean Swift recommended to servants for their amusement, namely, writing on the ceiling of a room with a candle.

40|$|The {{effect of}} the strain rate on the <b>sooting</b> limits in {{counterflow}} diffusion flames was investigated in various gaseous hydrocarbon fuels by varying the nitrogen dilution in the fuel and oxidizer streams. The <b>sooting</b> limit {{was defined as the}} critical fuel and oxygen mole fraction at which <b>soot</b> started to appear in the elastic light scattering signal. The <b>sooting</b> region for normal alkane fuels at a specified strain rate, in terms of the fuel and oxygen mole fraction, expanded as the number of carbon atoms increased. The alkene fuels (ethylene, propene) tested had a higher propensity for <b>sooting</b> as compared with alkane fuels with the same carbon numbers (ethane, propane). Branched iso-butane had a higher propensity for <b>sooting</b> than did n-butane. An increase in the strain rate reduced the tendency for <b>sooting</b> in all the fuels tested. The sensitivity of the <b>sooting</b> limit to the strain rate was more pronounced for less <b>sooting</b> fuels. When plotted in terms of calculated flame temperature, the critical oxygen mole fraction exhibited an Arrhenius form under <b>sooting</b> limit conditions, which can be utilized to significantly reduce the effort required to determine <b>sooting</b> limits at different strain rates.

60|$|This is most {{important}} for us as we proceed with our subject. Air is absolutely necessary for combustion; and, what is more, I must have you understand that fresh air is necessary, or else we should be imperfect in our reasoning and our experiments. Here is a jar of air. I place it over a candle, and it burns very nicely in it at first, shewing that what I have said about it is true; but there will soon be a change. See how the flame is drawing upwards, presently fading, and at last going out. And going out, why? Not because it wants air merely, for the jar is as full now as it was before; but it wants pure, fresh air. The jar is full of air, partly changed, partly not changed; {{but it does not}} contain sufficient of the fresh air which is necessary for the combustion of a candle. These are all points which we, as young chemists, have to gather up; and if we look a little more closely into this kind of action, we shall find certain steps of reasoning extremely interesting. For instance, here is the oil-lamp I shewed you--an excellent lamp for our experiments--the old Argand lamp. I now make it like a candle [obstructing the passage of air into the centre of the flame]; there is the cotton; there is the oil rising up it; and there is the conical flame. It burns poorly, because there is a partial restraint of air. I have allowed no air to get to it, save round the outside of the flame, and it does not burn well. I cannot admit more air from the outside, because the wick is large; but if, as Argand did so cleverly, I open a passage {{to the middle of the}} flame, and so let air come in there, you will see how much more beautifully it burns. If I shut the air off, look how it smokes; and why? We have now some very interesting points to study. We have the case of the combustion of a candle; we have the case of a candle being put out by the want of air; and we have now the case of imperfect combustion; and this is to us so interesting, that I want you to understand it as thoroughly as you do the case of a candle burning in its best possible manner. I will now make a great flame, because we need the largest possible illustrations. Here is a larger wick [burning turpentine on a ball of cotton]. All these things are the same as candles, after all. If we have larger wicks, we must have a larger supply of air, or we shall have less perfect combustion. Look now at this black substance going up into the atmosphere; there is a regular stream of it. I have provided means to carry off the imperfectly burned part, lest it should annoy you. Look at the <b>soots</b> that fly off from the flame: see what an imperfect combustion it is, because it cannot get enough air. What, then, is happening? Why, certain things which are necessary to the combustion of a candle are absent, and very bad results are accordingly produced; but we see what happens to a candle when it is burnt in a pure and proper state of air. At the time when I shewed you this charring by the ring of flame on the one side of the paper, I might have also shewn you, by turning to the other side, that the burning of a candle produces the same kind of soot--charcoal or carbon.|$|E

40|$|<b>Soot</b> {{released}} from fires not only causes danger to lives and property damage, but also effects fire spread by altering the radiation characteristics of fire effluents. In many situations, {{it is the}} <b>soot</b> concentration that controls the fire development. Therefore, <b>soot</b> modelling is of great importance in fire safety science. This necessitates {{the development of a}} global and general <b>soot</b> model within fire field models that can simulate the amount of <b>soot</b> generated and transported in large-scale fires in order to obtain an accurate <b>soot</b> concentration distribution within the building. A <b>soot</b> transport model, called Multi-Particle-Size (MPS) model, has been developed in this study to improve the prediction of <b>soot</b> particle behaviour during transportation by considering the uneven <b>soot</b> mass size distributions and gravitational settling force on <b>soot</b> particles. The efficiency of the MPS model was investigated by simulating <b>soot</b> movements in three real experiments. The first two validation experiments were cable fires in a large-scale enclosed corridor and the third experiment analysed the <b>soot</b> produced from a <b>soot</b> generator in a warehouse with a high ceiling. The <b>soot</b> layers predicted by the MPS model matched the measurements/observation better than that from the Conventional Model in which the <b>soot</b> generation is modelled with a constant <b>soot</b> yield (CY) value and <b>soot</b> particles are treated as a gaseous combustion product. A global <b>soot</b> generation model, called Beta <b>soot</b> generation (BSG) model has also been developed for non-premixed laminar flames. By making use of the characteristics of the beta function, the model has been extended to turbulent flames in the pre-scribed probability density function (PDF) approach with low cost in terms of computational resources. The model was validated by two turbulent methane and ethylene pool fires. The simulation results demonstrated that the <b>soot</b> volume fractions produced by the BSG model were in good agreement with the experimental data. Further, the two new models have been integrated into a single <b>soot</b> model called BSG+MPS model. The performance of the model was examined by predicting the <b>soot</b> generation and transport in a large-scale enclosed corridor. The BSG+MPS model improved the prediction of <b>soot</b> concentration distribution in the corridor compared with the CY +MPS model.

40|$|Abstract — The {{size and}} {{distribution}} of in-cylinder <b>soot</b> particles affect the sizes of <b>soot</b> particles emitted from exhaust tailpipes {{as well as the}} <b>soot</b> in oil. The simulation work reported in this paper focuses on the study of <b>soot</b> formation and movement inside a diesel engine with in-depth analysis of <b>soot</b> particles in the squish region. <b>Soot</b> particles in the squish region have high potential to be deposited onto the cylinder wall, and subsequently penetrate into engine lubrication system and contaminate the oil. The prediction of a <b>soot</b> particle pathline and size distribution was performed using post-processed in-cylinder combustion data from Kiva- 3 v computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with a series of Matlab routines. Only <b>soot</b> oxidation and <b>soot</b> surface growth process were considered in this study. Coagulation and agglomeration of <b>soot</b> particles were not taken into account. <b>Soot</b> particles were tracked from 8 crank angle (CA) degree after top dead center (ATDC) as <b>soot</b> starts to form in high concentration until 120 CA degree ATDC at exhaust valve opening (EVO).

40|$|Abstract: Particulate {{emission}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} deleterious pollutants generated by Diesel fuel combustion. The ability to predict <b>soot</b> formation {{is one of the}} key elements needed to optimize the engine performance and minimize <b>soot</b> emissions. This paper reports work on developing, a phenomenological <b>soot</b> model to better model the physical and chemical processes of <b>soot</b> formation in Diesel fuel combustion. This hybrid model features that the effect of turbulence on the chemical reaction rate was considered in <b>soot</b> oxidation. <b>Soot</b> formation and oxidation processes were modeled with the application of a hybrid method involving particle turbulent transport controlled rate and <b>soot</b> oxidation rate. Compared with the original <b>soot</b> model, the in-cylinder pressures, heat release rate and <b>soot</b> emissions predicted by this hybrid model agreed better with the experimental results. The verified hybrid model was used to investigate the effect of injection timing on engine performance. The results show that the new <b>soot</b> model predicted reasonable <b>soot</b> spatial profiles within the combustion chamber. The high temperature gase zone in cylinder for hybrid model case are distributed broadly <b>soot</b> and NOx emission dependence on the start-of-injection (SOI) timing. Retarded SOI timing increased the portion of diffusion combustion and the <b>soot</b> concentration increased significantly with retarding of the fuel injection timing. The predicted distributions of <b>soot</b> concentration and particle mass provide some new insights on the <b>soot</b> formation and oxidation processes in direct injection (DI) engines. The hybrid phenomenological <b>soot</b> model shows greater potential for enhancing understanding of combustion and <b>soot</b> formation processes in DI diesel engines...|$|R
40|$|The {{structure}} and <b>soot</b> surface growth properties of round laminar jet diffusion flames were studied experimentally. Measurements were made along the axes of ethylene-, propylene-propane- and acetylene-benzene-fueled flames burning in coflowing air at atmospheric pressure with the reactants at normal temperature. The measurements included <b>soot</b> structure, <b>soot</b> concentrations, <b>soot</b> temperatures, major gas species concentrations, some radial species (H, OH and O) concentrations, and gas velocities. These measurements yielded the local flame properties that {{are thought to}} affect <b>soot</b> surface growth {{as well as local}} <b>soot</b> surface growth rates. When present results were combined with similar earlier observations of acetylene-fueled laminar jet diffusion flames, the results suggested that <b>soot</b> surface growth involved decomposition of the original fuel to form acetylene and H, which were the main reactants for <b>soot</b> surface growth, and that the main effect of the parent fuel on <b>soot</b> surface growth involved its yield of acetylene and H for present test conditions. Thus, as the distance increased along the axes of the flames, <b>soot</b> formation (which was dominated by <b>soot</b> surface growth) began near the cool core of the flow once acetylene and H appeared together and ended near the flame sheet when acetylene disappeared. Species mainly responsible for <b>soot</b> oxidation - OH and O 2 were present throughout the <b>soot</b> formation region so that <b>soot</b> surface growth and oxidation proceeded at the same time. Present measurements of <b>soot</b> surface growth rates (corrected for <b>soot</b> surface oxidation) in laminar jet diffusion flames were consistent with earlier measurements of <b>soot</b> surface growth rates in laminar premixed flames and exhibited good agreement with existing Hydrogen-Abstraction/Carbon-Addition (HACA) <b>soot</b> surface growth mechanisms in the literature with steric factors in these mechanisms having values on the order of unity, as anticipated...|$|R
40|$|A {{two-dimensional}} simulation of a non-premixed ethylene–air flame {{was conducted by}} employing a detailed gas-phase reaction mechanism considering polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, an aerosol-dynamics-based <b>soot</b> model using a method of moments with interpolative closure, and a grey gas and <b>soot</b> radiation model using the discrete transfer method. Interaction of the <b>sooting</b> flame with a prescribed decaying random velocity field was investigated, with a primary interest in the effects of velocity fluctuations on the flame structure and the associated <b>soot</b> formation process for a fuel-strip configuration and a composition with mature <b>soot</b> growth. The temporally evolving simulation revealed a multi-layered <b>soot</b> formation process within the flame, {{at a level of}} detail not properly described by previous studies based on simplified <b>soot</b> models utilizing acetylene or naphthalene precursors for initial <b>soot</b> inception. The overall effect of the flame topology on the <b>soot</b> formation was found to be consistent with previous experimental studies, while a unique behaviour of localised strong oxidation was also noted. The imposed velocity fluctuations led to an increase of the scalar dissipation rate in the <b>sooting</b> zone, causing a net suppression in the <b>soot</b> production rate. Considering the complex structure of the <b>soot</b> formation layer, the effects of the imposed fluctuations vary depending on the individual <b>soot</b> reactions. For the conditions under study, the <b>soot</b> oxidation reaction was identified as the most sensitive to the fluctuations and was mainly responsible for the local suppression of the net <b>soot</b> production. © 2015 Taylor & Franci...|$|R

40|$|Previous studies {{indicate}} that sulfur in fuel affects the hygroscopicity of <b>soot.</b> However, {{the issue of the}} effect of sulfur in fuel on <b>soot</b> properties is not fully understood. Here, the properties of <b>soot</b> prepared from fuel with a variable sulfur content were investigated under lean and rich flame conditions. Lean flame <b>soot</b> was influenced more by sulfur in fuel than rich flame <b>soot.</b> The majority of sulfur in fuel in lean flame was converted to gaseous SO 2, while a small fraction appeared as sulfate and bisulfate (referred to as sulfate species) in <b>soot.</b> As the sulfur content in fuel increased, sulfate species in lean flame <b>soot</b> increased nonlinearly, while sulfate species on the surface of lean flame <b>soot</b> increased linearly. The hygroscopicity of lean flame <b>soot</b> from sulfur-containing fuel was enhanced mainly due to sulfate species. Meanwhile, more alkynes were formed in lean flame. The diameter of primary lean flame <b>soot</b> particles increased and accumulation mode particle number concentrations of lean flame <b>soot</b> from sulfur containing fuel increased as a result of more alkynes. Because the potential effects of <b>soot</b> particles on air pollution development greatly depend on the <b>soot</b> properties, which are related to both chemical aging and combustion conditions, this work will aid in understanding the impacts of <b>soot</b> on air quality and climate.

The equivalence ratio at the lift-off length is estimated with an empirical correlation and an idealized model of diesel spray.

This confirms that trends in <b>soot</b> emissions cannot be directly understood by the <b>soot</b> formation process. The coupling between <b>soot</b> emission levels and late heat release after end of injection is also studied.

In the present computational study, investigation of in-cylinder <b>soot</b> concentration as well as other emissions in a single cylinder diesel engine has been conducted, using a commercial multidimensional CFD software, CONVERGE CFD. The simulation was carried out for a close-cycle combustion environment from inlet valve closing (IVC) to exhaust valve opening (EVO).
