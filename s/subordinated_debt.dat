40|$|This paper {{examines}} how the risk based capital standards, the so-called Basle Accord between 1990 and 1993. As the Japanese stock prices fell, banks' latent capital gains, which {{are part of}} tier II capital, became smaller.

40|$|Despite the {{downward}} trend of land {{prices and the}} ex-post low re- turn on real estate loans, Japanese banks increased their lending to the real estate sector during the 1990 s. We argue that this phenomenon {{can be explained by}} the risk-shifting incentives of banks and discover that banks with low capital-to-asset ratios and low franchise value chose high-risk assets such as real estate loans. Unlike previous stud- ies, we show that the capital-risk relationship is nonlinear and changes from positive to negative as franchise value falls. We also nd that a capital adequacy requirement did not prevent risk-taking behavior of undercapitalized banks since they then just issued more <b>subordinated</b> <b>debts</b> to meet this requirement. In contrast, government capital injec- tions led banks to reduce risky loans at the margin. Recapitalization by issuing <b>subordinated</b> <b>debts</b> helped banks recover their capital losses and mitigated the credit crunch, but consequently allowed them to in- crease their exposure to the real estate sector and worsened the bad loan problems...|$|R

40|$|An {{estimated}} 12. 6 % {{of primary}} mortgage loans were simultaneously originated {{with a second}} loan from 2004 until 2008, although relatively {{little is known about}} how the presence of such subordinate loans affects the default decisions of borrowers. We use a novel data series of loan servicing records from 2002 until 2010 to identify such borrowers and find evidence that the default behavior of these borrowers significantly differs from borrowers without second loans. Estimating a discrete-time proportional odds hazard model, we find borrowers with a second loan were 62. 7 % more likely to default each month on their primary loan when conditioning alone on the attributes of the primary loan. However, borrowers of second loans were 58. 3 % less likely to default on their primary loan as compared to single loan borrowers with equivalent current combined attributes (i. e., loan-to-value, balance, and interest rate). We hypothesize and provide empirical evidence this occurs because borrowers with second loans have the option to sequentially default on each loan since subordinate lenders will not pursue foreclosure if borrowers have insufficient equity. Lenders of defaulted <b>subordinate</b> <b>debt</b> may revisit their decision to foreclose in the future after housing markets start to recover, thus prompting a new round of foreclosures...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—With the {{drafting}} of new banking regulation via the Basel II capital accord, bank regulatory capital and its adequacy has become {{the subject of much}} debate. In our contribution, we strive to construct a stochastic dynamic model to describe the evolution of bank capital that incorporates capital gains and losses. In our paper, such gains and losses are represented by loan loss reserves and the unexpected loan losses, respectively. In this regard, we recognize that bank capital consists of Tier 1 capital (mainly equity which is modeled via an exponential Lévy process), Tier 2 and Tier 3 capital (collectively known as supplementary capital). The latter two types of capital mainly consist of (short- and long-term) <b>subordinate</b> <b>debt</b> held by debtholders and loan losses reserves. Furthermore, we setup an optimal capital management problem which maximizes the expectation of bank capital under a risk constraint on the Capital-at-Risk (CaR), where CaR is defined in terms of Valueat-Risk (VaR). In particular, we seek an optimal bank capital management strategy in a mean-CaR paradigm. Historical evidence from Organization for Economic Corporation and Development (OCED) countries assists us in establishing the relationship between output gap (as the proxy of business cycle) and capital adequacy ratios (CARs). Finally, we provide a brief analysis of some of the optimal capital management issues and suggestions for topics of possible future direction...|$|R
