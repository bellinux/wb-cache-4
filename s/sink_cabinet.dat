5000|$|Group Challenge: The Kitchen Continues - Right off the top, Matt assigns four {{tasks to}} each of the others: Deen is to finish the diamond plating he has been working on for several episodes, Simon is to build and attach the <b>sink</b> <b>cabinet</b> doors, Angela is to finish cutting tiles for the Delta Upsilon emblem, while Cory is to install a new range hood. Cory does not read the {{instructions}} all the way, and installs the range hood too high (as Ontario building codes set a maximum height difference between stove top and range hood); to compensate, he decides to build a platform. Deen diverts some of his time to assist Matt in plumbing the dishwasher, as he wants {{to learn how to do}} plumbing back home. He is then tasked to finish the remainder of the plumbing while Matt himself switches gears to tiling with Angela. The tile job proves to be difficult due to Matt using too much adhesive, making a mess out of the [...] "Delta" [...] tiles in the Delta Upsilon logo as the adhesive comes up between the tiles. Matt's demand for perfection, however, meant that he wants to start the tile job over. As for Simon's task, he takes over 90 minutes in repeatedly installing and uninstalling doors that do not fit due to the openings being unlevel and not plumb. In the end, none of the major tasks are completed.|$|E

5000|$|Kitchens today. Modern kitchen {{design has}} {{improved}} {{partly as a}} result of ergonomic research. Functionality is important; one research study had [...] "anthropological scientists" [...] observing homeowners [...] "interact" [...] with their kitchen cabinets. Kitchens are larger and have more cabinets; some kitchens may have as many as fifty drawers and cabinet doors. New features today include deep drawers for cookware, pull-out shelves to avoid excess bending, sponge trays on the front of <b>sink</b> <b>cabinets,</b> pullout hideaway garbage/recycling containers, pull-out spice cabinets, lazy susans in corner cabinets, vertical storage for cookie sheets, full-extension drawer slides, and drawers and doors with so-called soft-close/positive-close mechanisms enabling drawers to shut quietly, or which shut fully after being pushed only partially. As housing stocks get older, many homeowners face problems with visually unappealing older kitchen cabinets; in such situations, there is a choice to buy new (most expensive), reface existing (less expensive), or to strip and refinish existing (least expensive if done by the homeowner) cabinets. By 2009, there was more emphasis on cabinets designed with environmental factors in mind. So-called [...] "green cabinets" [...] were becoming more popular. As homes in Western countries became more airtight to save on heating and cooling costs, air quality has sometimes suffered as gases which are released from resins as they cure. Resins, organic materials which convert from liquid to solid form, are used to manufacture engineered wood (e.g., particleboard) frequently used to build kitchen cabinet carcases can be a factor.

40|$|Introduction: Possible {{contamination}} in nuclear medicine centers, {{in addition to}} health problems, affect the tests and much effort and cost is required for decontamination. Given the effects of ionizing radiation on human health, rules and regulations have been enacted to avoid contamination, that in working with radioactive materials should be followed to minimize them.. Material and Method: After mapping of nuclear medicine centers in the province, areas that should be studied for measuring the amount of radioactive contamination were determined. The site selection for the tests {{were based on the}} area in which the possibility of further contamination were existance. After measuring the background count rate the radioactive {{contamination in}} studied areas were performed using Wipe Test.. Result: The mean level of background contamination in centers 1, 2 and 3 were 1. 75 ± 0. 150 μCi, 4. 43 ± 0. 615 μCi and 2. 47 ± 0. 055 μCi, respectively. In center 1, only region of Hood pollution was much higher than the permissible limit. In center 2, radioactive contamination of the waiting room, patient rooms, warehouse radiotracer, control room, hood, desk and floor center was exceeded. Also, in center 3, contamination of the doorway, hallway patients, control room, hood, desk, <b>sink,</b> <b>cabinets,</b> room and floor imaging injection (control), respectively, were higher than the permissible limits.. Conclusion: In centers 1 and 2, most of the radioactive contamination occurred under the hood due to labeling of radiopharmaceuticals activity. Also, in center 3, the highest contamination rate belonged to patients’ corridor that could be due to frequent the area. According to this subject, necessary measures in this regard should be considered by the department responsible for health physics...|$|R

One, her wet laboratory, opened onto both the {{port and starboard}} decks through Dutch doors, had in its center a stainless steel sink suitable for handling and examining fish, and had two small <b>sinks</b> in <b>cabinets</b> on its outside bulkheads for chemical and hydrographic work. Her other laboratory, a dry laboratory, was aft of the wet laboratory and doubled as a library; it had a large work table, chairs, a bench, and shelves, and early in her career served as an office for scientists conducting the preliminary study of data collected at sea, although it later was filled with electronic equipment related to underwater television research.|$|R

50|$|The 1887 {{portion of}} the {{building}} comprises a large public area (11 m wide) with a substantial painted cedar counter on the left hand side. A central hallway (1.8 x 11.3 m) separated from the public area {{by a pair of}} timber doors leads {{to the rear of the}} building and provides access to four rooms, two on each side which are interconnected with doorways. In the hallway wall, a slot exists into the area behind the counter, most likely for the quick transmission of documents. The front left-hand side office (former chief clerk's office) behind the public space has timber shelving with labels indicating it was used to store wine and spirits. Bathroom and laundry facilities have been fitted within the rear right-hand side room (former Millican's office) and there is a <b>sink</b> and <b>cabinet</b> located in the adjacent room (former board room), none of which are of cultural heritage significance.|$|R

40|$|The heat {{dissipation}} capacity of air-cooled {{computing and telecommunications}} cabinets is limited by acoustic noise and fan reliability considerations. The present work quantifies the potential for thermal management of a sealed cabinet using an evaporating mist introduced upstream of the high-power electronic components. The proposed concept consists of droplets of mist being dispersed in the air flowing through a heat sink. The evaporated mist is condensed at the outlet of the circuit packs and recycled back to the inlet. The flow and heat-transfer characteristics of mist flows in a representative heat <b>sink</b> inside the <b>cabinet</b> are explored through numerical analysis of the coupled mass, momentum and energy transport equations for an evaporating two-phase mixture. The effect of droplet size and the mist loading fraction on the heat sink temperature reduction is computed and parametrically analyzed. The results reveal significant insights into the complex transport processes associated with mist flows. Mist cooling is shown to offer significant promise as a feasible thermal management solution for telecommunications cabinets and data centers...|$|R
6000|$|... 282. But, secondly, {{consider}} the attractive power of false art, completed, {{as compared with}} imperfect art advancing to completion. Archaic work, so far as faultful, is repulsive, but advanced work is, in all its faults, attractive. The moment that art has reached {{the point at which}} it becomes sensitively and delicately imitative, it appeals to a new audience. From that instant it addresses the sensualist and the idler. Its deceptions, its successes, its subtleties, become interesting to every condition of folly, of frivolity, and of vice. And this new audience brings to bear upon the art in which its foolish and wicked interest has been unhappily awakened, the full power of its riches: the largest bribes of gold as well as of praise are offered to the artist who will betray his art, until at last, from the sculpture of Phidias and fresco of Luini, it <b>sinks</b> into the <b>cabinet</b> ivory and the picture kept under lock and key. Between these highest and lowest types, there is a vast mass of merely imitative and delicately sensual sculpture;--veiled nymphs--chained slaves--soft goddesses seen by roselight through suspended curtains--drawing room portraits and domesticities, and such like, in which the interest is either merely personal and selfish, or dramatic and sensational; in either case, destructive {{of the power of the}} public to sympathize with the aims of great architects.|$|R
40|$|A task-oriented space {{can benefit}} from an {{augmented}} reality interface that layers the existing tools and surfaces with useful information to make cooking more easy, safe and efficient. To serve experienced users as well as novices, augmented reality interfaces need to adapt modalities to the user’s expertise and allow for multiple ways to perform tasks. We present a framework for designing an intelligent user interface that informs and choreographs multiple tasks in a single space according to a model of tasks and users. A residential kitchen has been outfitted with systems to gather data from tools and surfaces and project multi-modal interfaces back onto the tools and surfaces themselves. Based on user evaluations of this augmented reality kitchen, we propose a system to tailor information modalities based on the spatial and temporal qualities of the task, and the expertise, location and progress of the user. The intelligent augmented reality user interface choreographs multiple tasks in the same space at the same time. Anywhere Projector augments reality by projecting interfaces on any surface in a single room [4]. We have shown a variety of interfaces projected onto the objects and surfaces of the kitchen can aid in the task of cooking, communicating and orienting tasks [2]. We built an augmented reality kitchen where simple sensing and projection augment the refrigerator, cook-top, <b>cabinets,</b> <b>sink</b> and drawers (see Figure 1) [1]. User evaluations of this environment reveal problems that the CounterActive and Anywhere Projector models have limited interface modalities and are inflexible in their approach to tasks. A single recipe can be performed {{in a number of}} different ways, especially by users of varied experience. Information projection benefits every step if the interface modalities are carefully tailored to the location, expertise and performance of the user(s) ...|$|R
