40|$|This paper makes three {{observations}} {{with regard}} to the application of algorithms such as wsat and relsat to problems of practical interest. First, we identify a specific calculation ("subsearch") that is performed at each inference step by any existing satisfiability algorithm. We then show that for realistic problems, the time spent on <b>subsearch</b> can be expected to dominate the computational cost of the algorithm. Finally, we present a specific modification to the representation that exploits the structure of naturally occurring problems and leads to exponential reductions in the time needed for <b>subsearch.</b> 1 Introduction The last few years have seen extraordinary improvements in the effectiveness of general-purpose Boolean satisfiability algorithms. This work began with the application of wsat [Selman et al., 1996] to "practical" problems in a variety of domains (generative planning [Kautz and Selman, 1992], circuit layout, and others) by translating these problems into [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to identify appropriate low-degree polynomial fuel consumption models for use in intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), eco-drive assist systems, and microscopic traffic simulation software. The different models that are assessed include models found in the literature and new models developed using a <b>subsearch</b> regression based on the Akaike information criterion. The models are evaluated based on model structures and their effectiveness in predicting instantaneous vehicle fuel consumption levels. Measurement data obtained from an engine dynamometer, a chassis dynamometer, and on-road testing are used to conduct the study. The study demonstrates that several low-degree polynomial fuel consumption models with a quadratic control term are appropriate for use in ITS applications (R 2 > 0. 9). status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the ability}} of graphs to {{represent}} more generic and more complicated relationships among different objects, graph mining has {{played a significant role in}} data mining, attracting increasing attention in the data mining community. In addition, frequent coherent subgraphs can provide valu-able knowledge about the underlying internal structure of a graph database, and mining frequently occurring coherent subgraphs from large dense graph databases has witnessed several applications and received considerable attention in the graph mining community recently. In this article, we study how to efficiently mine the complete set of coherent closed quasi-cliques from large dense graph databases, which is an especially challenging task due to the fact that the downward-closure property no longer holds. By fully exploring some properties of quasi-cliques, we propose several novel optimization techniques which can prune the unpromising and redundant <b>subsearch</b> spaces effectively. Meanwhile, we devise an efficient closure checking scheme to facilitate the discovery of closed quasi-cliques only. Since large databasescannot be held in main memory, we also design an A preliminary conference version of this article entitled â€œCoherent Closed Quasi-Clique Discover...|$|E
40|$|The {{computational}} cost {{of searching}} for new pulsars is a limiting factor for upcoming radio telescopes such as SKA. We introduce four new algorithms: an optimal constant-period search, a coherent tree search which permits optimal searching with O(1) cost per model, a semicoherent search which combines information from coherent <b>subsearches</b> while preserving as much phase information as possible, and a hierarchical search which interpolates between the coherent and semicoherent limits. Taken together, these algorithms improve the computational cost of pulsar search by several orders of magnitude. In this paper, we consider the simple case of a constant-acceleration phase model, but our methods should generalize to more complex search spaces...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{efficient}} method for approximate search in electronic lexica. Given an input string (the pattern) and a similarity threshold, the algorithm retrieves all entries of the lexicon that are sufficiently {{similar to the}} pattern. Search is organized in <b>subsearches</b> that always start with an exact partial match where a substring of the input pattern is aligned with a substring of a lexicon word. Afterwards this partial match is extended stepwise to larger substrings. For aligning further parts of the pattern with corresponding parts of lexicon entries, more errors are tolerated at each subsequent step. For supporting this alignment order, which may start at {{any part of the}} pattern, the lexicon is represented as a structure that enables immediate access to any substring of a lexicon word and permits the extension of such substrings in both directions. Experimental evaluations of the approximate search procedure are given that show significant efficiency improvements compared to existing techniques. Since the technique can be used for large error bounds it offers interesting possibilities for approximate search in special collections of "long" strings, such as phrases, sentences, or book t...|$|R
40|$|Planning optimal paths {{for large}} numbers of robots is {{computationally}} expensive. In this thesis, we present a new framework for multirobot path planning called subdimensional expansion, which initially plans for each robot individually, and then coordinates motion among the robots as needed. More specifically subdimensional expansion initially creates a one-dimensional search space embedded in the joint configuration space of the multirobot system. When the search space {{is found to be}} blocked during planning by a robot-robot collision, the dimensionality of the search space is locally increased to ensure that an alternative path can be found. As a result, robots are only coordinated when necessary, which reduces the computational cost of finding a path. Subdimensional expansion is a exible framework that can be used with multiple planning algorithms. For discrete planning problems, subdimensional expansion can be combined with A* to produce the M* algorithm, a complete and optimal multirobot path planning problem. When the configuration space of individual robots is too large to be explored effectively with A*, subdimensional expansion can be combined with probabilistic planning algorithms to produce sRRT and sPRM. M* is then extended to solve variants of the multirobot path planning algorithm. We present the Constraint Manifold <b>Subsearch</b> (CMS) algorithm to solve problems where robots must dynamically form and dissolve teams with other robots to perform cooperative tasks. Uncertainty M* (UM*) is a variant of M* that handles systems with probabilistic dynamics. Finally, we apply M* to multirobot sequential composition. Results are validated with extensive simulations and experiments on multiple physical robots...|$|E
