She learns Roark's true {{identity}} when they are introduced at the party opening the Enright House, the new building that Roark has designed which The Banner has campaigned against. Francon goes to Roark's apartment and offers to marry him if he gives up architecture to save himself from a hopeless struggle.

She tells Laura, somewhat evasively, that the problem is in her uterus, probably the cause of her infertility. Laura moves to comfort Kitty with an embrace. <b>She</b> <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> sense of {{what it would be like}} to be a man, and also a sort of jealousy towards Ray, Kitty's husband. Both women capitulate to the moment, to holding each other. Laura is kissing Kitty's forehead, when Kitty lifts her face and {{the two women}} kiss each other on the lips.|$|E

In spite of this, Singin' and Swingin has been called [...] "a love song to Angelou's son". Just as she changes her name as the story progresses, so does Guy, who becomes an intelligent, sensitive boy {{in the pages of}} this book. As Guy grows, so does his mother; Hagen stated that this growth moves Angelou's story forward. When Angelou discovers how deeply their separation injures Guy, she leaves the Porgy and Bess tour before it ends, at great personal cost. By the end of the book, their bond is deepened and she promises never to leave him again. As Hagen states, Maya embraces the importance of motherhood, just as she had done {{at the end of her}} previous autobiographies.|$|E

500|$|Through her Twitter account, Fantasia {{discussed}} how <b>she</b> <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> strong connection between her music career and her Christian faith. When asked {{whether she would}} record a gospel album, she responded that all of her music was already {{a part of the}} genre and that [...] " [...] take God with [...] everywhere [...] go".

500|$|The {{concept of}} Grey and Shepherd's fight was {{described}} by Buchman as having [...] "no more taboos", {{compared to the other}} story lines developed in the episode: [...] "Even though it was a minor fight, it's very revealing for Meredith. This is probably the longest relationship she's every been in, and the first with someone <b>she</b> <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> genuine connection with. We might know Derek will come back, but she doesn't." [...] The last scene of them in the episode has been deemed [...] "a milestone of sorts for Meredith", with the goal to determine her to admit how new to this romantic development in her personal life she actually is, after years of being known as the woman with habitual excessive drinking and sexual relationships with inappropriate men. Also noted was the aftermath of Alex and Addison's kiss in the previous episode: [...] "What's most painful about that scene? Not that Alex effectively shut Addison down in such a cold and direct manner. But that it seems like such a waste of chemistry. When they went into that closet, the last thing we wanted to see them do is pour water on their fire", stated Buchman, noting how the scene was written to be [...] "frustrating, shocking, and therefore unexpected" [...] for the audience.|$|E
500|$|Webster {{started playing}} water polo as a ten-year-old, and more seriously as a twelve-year-old in Melbourne, Australia {{acting as a}} fill-in for her older sister's team at that age. [...] In 2010 and 2011, she had a water polo {{scholarship}} from the Victorian Institute of Sport.

It's {{important}} to know that we are commanders who have the power to shape our own destiny." [...] Love explained to Rap-Up magazine his view of the song, [...] "It's just such an aggressive record, it's a club record, it's a worldwide international record. She's stretching her legs out and she's showing her true vocal ability, she's like the queen of the night on this record." [...] Then during the video shoot of the song Rowland said [...] "I feel like I've finally come into my own," [...] a reference to the exploration of a new musical sound. [...] "With the sound of dance music getting embraced more, I'm very excited, seeing how fans have been responding to the music. Dance music is more of a European thing, but I've been looking on Twitter and seeing fans (in different parts of the country) talking about playing 'Commander'." [...] She said working with Guetta was [...] "amazing" [...] because it is [...] "effortless" [...] and <b>she</b> <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> great sense of [...] "chemistry" [...] when working with him. Rowland felt she was trying something different: [...] "In this generation and this day and time, no one is putting soul in dance music... no pop artist. I thought maybe that was something I could try. And then it works." [...] In an interview for MSN Xin Rowland admitted the song was [...] "darker" [...] than her previous material but still fun.

500|$|M.I.A. {{attributes}} much of {{her success}} to the [...] "homeless, rootlessness" [...] of her early life. Due to her and her family being displaced from Sri Lanka because of the Civil War, M.I.A. has become a refugee icon. The EMP Museum's 2008 Pop Conference featured paper submissions and discussions on M.I.A. presented {{on the theme of}} [...] "Shake, Rattle: Music, Conflict, and Change." [...] She has used networking sites such as Twitter and MySpace to discuss and highlight the human rights abuses and war crimes that Sri Lanka is accused of perpetrating against Tamils, citing news articles, human rights group reports, government reports, her own experiences as a child and on her return to the island in 2001 to support calls for a ceasefire. M.I.A. has also used a great deal of tiger print and imagery, a symbol for the Tamil Tigers in both album artwork and music videos, such as seen in [...] "Galang". Being the only Tamil widely known in Western media, M.I.A. has discussed how <b>she</b> <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> responsibility to represent the Tamil minority. M.I.A. has spoken of discussions with witnesses during and after the war as reinforcing the need for international intervention to protect and provide justice to Tamil people. As the 2009 Tamil diaspora protests gathered pace, she joined other activists in condemning the actions of the Sri Lankan government against the Tamil populace as a slow [...] "systematic" [...] genocide. Telling TIME that she didn't see anything wrong in sticking up for 300,000 trapped and dying people, M.I.A. stated that international governments were privy to Sri Lanka's use of widespread censorship and propaganda on the rebellion during the island's civil war to aid its impunity in numerous atrocities on civilians, but had no will to end it. Sri Lanka's Foreign Secretary denied that his country perpetrated genocide, responding that he felt M.I.A. was [...] "misinformed" [...] and that [...] "it's best she stays with what she's good at, which is music, not politics." [...] She has also appeared on Real Time with Bill Maher, as well as other television networks, to discuss the issues in Sri Lanka and critique the Sri Lankan government and their censorship of the media.|$|E
2500|$|She has lectured widely {{about her}} {{first-hand}} {{experiences of the}} anxiety of feeling threatened by everything in her surroundings, and of being dismissed and feared, which allegedly motivates her work in humane livestock handling processes. She studied the behavior of cattle, how they react to ranchers, movements, objects, and light. Grandin then designed adapted curved corrals, intended to reduce stress, panic and injury in animals being led to slaughter. This {{has proved to be}} a further point of criticism and controversy among animal activists who have questioned the congruence of a career built on animal slaughter alongside Grandin's claims of compassion and respect for animals. While her designs are widely used throughout the slaughterhouse industry, her claim of compassion for the animals is that because of her autism she can see the animals' reality from their viewpoint, that when she holds an animal's head in her hands as it is being slaughtered, <b>she</b> <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> deep, godlike connection to them.|$|E

2500|$|When fourteen-year-old Jo Tiegan is {{shopping}} {{with her father}} in 1995, she notices an antique shop which <b>she</b> <b>feels</b> <b>a</b> compulsion to go to. There she sees a beautiful oval mirror, which she is given as a gift by the elderly owner of the shop [...] who comments that the mirror is meant for her. Jo is delighted, and the mirror is placed in her bedroom. That night, Jo is stunned to see the image of another girl in the mirror, instead of her own reflection, and {{it is obvious that}} the other girl, Louisa Iredale (also fourteen years old), can see her just as clearly. Louisa is able to 'introduce' herself to Jo by writing her name on a book for Jo to read. However, when Jo tries to write her name on the mirror to introduce herself to Louisa, she is startled when the pen begins to disappear into the mirror. After Louisa is called away to dinner, Jo investigates the mystery and is accidentally pulled through the mirror into Louisa's bedroom in 1919. This leads to the discovery, by Jo and Louisa, that they can visit each other's times, through the mirror, any time they want to do so [...] provided that the mirror is situated in exactly the same place and that the mirror's alignment and orientation are identical within the mirror's frame, at corresponding moments in 1919 and 1995.|$|E

50|$|This is {{a second}} {{interpretation}} of the story. The short story begins with a statement that attempts to connect to the reader, and basically all of humanity. Everyone eats and sleeps, therefore the narrator is attempting to come across as normal. However, <b>she</b> <b>feels</b> <b>an</b> unusual connection between sleeping, eating, and sex. In sleep, <b>she</b> <b>feels</b> free and weightless and able to escape reality. In eating, <b>she</b> <b>feels</b> sensual and intimate. In sex, <b>she</b> also <b>feels</b> limitless and liberated, but also {{as if she is}} attached or being held down, suggesting that her morals are pulling her down as she has sex with potential strangers.
