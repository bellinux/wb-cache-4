5|$|The film {{returns to}} the opening scene. Tommy breaks down in tears but stops crying when, upon {{catching}} sight of a mirror, he sees the image of Marty <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> He finishes dressing for the fight and, as {{he walks to the}} ring, hears Stephanie calling to him. He turns to her; they smile. He resumes his walk to the ring and the camera pulls back to reveal that he is dressed in Marty's old ring robe in tribute.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time, snipers in the {{hovering}} Razor 2 helicopter {{shot and killed}} Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti {{when he came to}} the door of the guest house firing an AK-47. One SEAL sniper fired two shots at al-Kuwaiti and the other fired two three-round bursts. Two of the snipers' bullets went through al-Kuwaiti and killed his wife who was <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> The Razor 2 team cleared the guest house and then breached their way into the main house with explosives. As the Razor 2 team entered the main house, al-Qaeda courier Arshad Khan pointed his AK-47 gun and was killed with two shots. The SEAL team fired a total of 16 shots, killing Osama bin Laden, Khalid bin Laden, Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti and al-Kuwaiti's wife, Arshad Khan, and wounding Osama bin Laden's wife Amal al-Sadah.|$|E
5|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by Andy Morahan and Eric Watson, and consists of shots of the duo around London. At {{the beginning of the}} video, noises from the city can be heard, a camera passes Lowe on the street, and focuses on two vintage dolls in a shop window. Then appears a sequence of quick cuts with shots of the city's different sub-cultures; the video freezes and cuts to Tennant and Lowe, who walk through an empty Wentworth Street in Petticoat Lane Market. They stand in front of a red garage door; Tennant is in front dressed with a long coat, white shirt and dark necktie, directly addressing the camera, with Lowe <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> with a blank expression. Lowe is filmed in double-exposure and appears almost ghostlike. In other shots, Tennant walks imperiously while Lowe follows behind.|$|E

5|$|Appearing {{as some of}} {{the more}} notable hostages are Ken Leung as Wing, who was distracted in the bank before the heist by the bosomy woman (played by Samantha Ivers) <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> and talking loudly on her phone; Gerry Vichi as Howard Kurtz, an elderly hostage {{suffering}} chest pains who is quickly released by the robbers; Waris Ahluwalia as Vikram Walia, a Sikh bank clerk whose turban is removed by the cops, which is a religious sacrilege for a Sikh male; Peter Frechette as Peter Hammond, a bank employee whose attempt to hide his cell phone from Russell results in his getting beat; Amir Ali Said as Brian Robinson, an 8-year-old boy who speaks with both Russell and Frazier and who plays a killing video game; Ed Onipede Blunt as Ray Robinson, Brian's father; and Marcia Jean Kurtz, who plays an older woman who initially refuses to strip and is forced to do so by Stevie. Kurtz's character is named Miriam Douglas; Kurtz played a hostage named Miriam in Dog Day Afternoon, a bank robbery film, which unlike Inside Man, contained significant violence. Lionel Pina, who also appeared in Dog Day Afternoon as a pizza delivery man, appears in Inside Man as a policeman who delivers pizzas at the bank's front doors.|$|E
25|$|Burne-Jones's best-known {{portrait}} {{of his wife}} was begun in 1883, and shows her holding an herbal, with her children in the background, Philip (aged about 22) at his easel and Margaret (about 17) <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> Burne-Jones tinkered with the portrait for years, and it remained unfinished at his death. It was never exhibited in his lifetime.|$|E
25|$|An {{incident}} in September 2000 involving five male police officers entering a woman's bath house sparked public outrage and {{drew attention to}} TPS's poor standing in the gay community.

25|$|The 4¢ Lincoln-Douglas debate {{postage stamp}} was first issued on August 27, 1958, at Freeport, Illinois. This issue {{was the first}} in the series and was first {{released}} on the 100th anniversary of the Lincoln-Douglas debates. The engraved image is modeled after a painting by Joseph Boggs that portrays Lincoln addressing an outdoor crowd with Douglas <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> Artist William K. Schrage of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing based the stamp design on work done by Ervine Metzl of New York City.|$|E
25|$|Threesomes in Roman art {{typically}} show two men penetrating a woman, {{but one of}} the Suburban scenes has one man {{entering a}} woman from the rear while he in turn receives anal sex from a man <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> This scenario is described also by Catullus, Carmen 56, who considers it humorous. The man in the center may be a cinaedus, a male who liked to receive anal sex but who was also considered seductive to women. Foursomes also appear in Roman art, typically with two women and two men, sometimes in same-sex pairings.|$|E
500|$|The only genuine {{friendship}} in the Who {{during the}} 1960s was between Entwistle and Moon. The pair enjoyed each other's sense of humour and shared {{a fondness for}} clubbing. Journalist Richard Green noted a [...] "chemistry of playfullness that would go beyond playfullness". Their relationship diminished somewhat when Entwistle got married in 1967, though they still socialised on tour. When Moon was destroying toilets in hotels, Entwistle confessed he [...] "was <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> with the matches".|$|E

500|$|The {{cover of}} the CD depicts Yankovic with a poodle on his head, {{standing}} in a crowded subway car. The poodle in question was Yankovic's own dog, Bela. Before deciding on the final shot of his poodle, Yankovic and his production crew tried a setup that featured Bela urinating on his head, but Yankovic later admitted, [...] "It was more disgusting than funny." [...] In regards to the people <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> in the subway car, Yankovic specified via the [...] "Ask Al" [...] Q on his website: ...|$|E
500|$|Entwistle {{recalled}} {{being close}} to Moon on tour: [...] "I suppose we were two of a kind"...We shared a room {{on the road and}} got up to no good." [...] Consequently, both were often involved in blowing up toilets. In a 1981 Los Angeles Times interview he admitted, [...] "A lot of times when Keith was blowing up toilets I was <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> with the matches." [...] In Alabama, Moon and Entwistle loaded a toilet with cherry bombs after being denied room service. According to Entwistle, [...] "That toilet was just dust all over the walls by the time we checked out. The management brought our suitcases down to the gig and said: 'Don't come back...'" ...|$|E
500|$|In early June, Edward {{personally}} {{supervised the}} drafting of a clean version of his devise by lawyers, to which he lent his signature [...] "in six several places." [...] Then, on 15 June he summoned high ranking judges to his sickbed, commanding them on their allegiance [...] "with sharp words and angry countenance" [...] to prepare his devise as letters patent and {{announced that he would}} have these passed in parliament. His next measure was to have leading councillors and lawyers sign a bond in his presence, in which they agreed faithfully to perform Edward's will after his death. A few months later, Chief Justice Edward Montagu recalled that when he and his colleagues had raised legal objections to the devise, Northumberland had threatened them [...] "trembling for anger, and ... further said that he would fight in his shirt with any man in that quarrel". Montagu also overheard a group of lords <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> conclude [...] "if they refused to do that, they were traitors". At last, on 21 June, the devise was signed by over a hundred notables, including councillors, peers, archbishops, bishops, and sheriffs; many of them later claimed that they had been bullied into doing so by Northumberland, although in the words of Edward's biographer Jennifer Loach, [...] "few of them gave any clear indication of reluctance at the time".|$|E

60|$|Suddenly, a subdued {{murmur of}} applause {{and a slight}} rustle <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> {{recalled}} him to himself again. He wheeled his chair quickly round. The two principals {{of the school and}} half a dozen teachers were <b>standing</b> gravely <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> and at the open door a dozen curled and frizzled youthful heads peered in eagerly, but half restrained by their teachers. The relaxed features and apologetic attitude of Madame Bance and Miss Mix showed that Mr. Hamlin had unconsciously achieved a triumph.|$|R
60|$|Wolf's trot {{broke into}} a run. Wider and wider were the leaps he made. Not once did he turn his head, his wolf's brush <b>standing</b> out {{straight}} <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b> He cut sharply across {{the curve of the}} trail and was gone.|$|R

2500|$|Also seen in {{the cave}} are panels with carvings of two images of Pallava kings with their queens.

In another panel opposite to the first one another Pallava King in his royal splendour is standing with his two queens, in a reverential posture below which the title inscribed is [...] "The Glorious Adhiraja Mahendra-Potta." [...] These inscriptions have been interpreted as representing Rajasimha, titled Narasimha Vishnu in the first panel and the second figure (of standing king) of his son Mahendravarman III.|$|E
2500|$|John Gregory Bourke's {{memoir of}} his {{service in the}} Indian wars, On the Border with Crook, {{describes}} a different account of Crazy Horse's death. He based his account on an interview with Crazy Horse's rival, Little Big Man, who was present at Crazy Horse's arrest and wounding. The interview took place over a year after Crazy Horse's death. [...] Little Big Man said that, as Crazy Horse was being escorted to the guardhouse, he suddenly pulled two knives from under his blanket and held one in each hand. One knife was reportedly fashioned from an army bayonet. Little Big Man, <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> seized Crazy Horse by both elbows, pulling his arms up behind him. As Crazy Horse struggled, Little Big Man lost his grip on one elbow, and Crazy Horse drove his own knife deep into his own lower back. The guard stabbed Crazy Horse with his bayonet in the back. The chief fell and surrendered to the guards.|$|E
6000|$|... "That night, {{the last}} night of the year, towards nine o'clock, a man in a black dress rang at my gate, demanded to see me, and softly {{followed}} my servant, Ernest Defarge, a youth, up-stairs.

60|$|He turned around. Mrs. Weatherley was <b>standing</b> just <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> leaning also {{out of the}} window, with {{a little}} halo of light about her head. For a moment he was {{powerless}} to answer. Her head was thrown back, her lips parted. She seemed to be listening as well as watching. There was fear in {{her eyes as she}} looked at him, yet she made the most beautiful picture he had ever seen. He pulled himself together.|$|R
6000|$|That was all Bert {{could get}} for a time. But the {{excitement}} of all the men about him was contagious, and presently he saw Kurt <b>standing</b> alone, hands <b>behind</b> <b>him,</b> and looking {{at one of the}} distant waterfalls very steadfastly. He went up and saluted, soldier-fashion. [...] "Beg pardon, lieutenant," [...] he said.|$|R
2500|$|The six conspirators {{lined the}} route. They were spaced {{out along the}} Appel Quay, each one with {{instructions}} to try to kill Franz Ferdinand when the royal car reached his position. The first conspirator on the route to see the royal car was Muhamed Mehmedbašić. Standing by the Austro-Hungarian Bank, Mehmedbašić lost his nerve and allowed the car to pass without taking action. Mehmedbašić later said that a policeman was <b>standing</b> <b>behind</b> <b>him</b> and feared he would be arrested before {{he had a chance}} to throw his bomb. At 10:15, when the six-car procession passed the central police station, nineteen-year-old student Nedeljko Čabrinović hurled a hand grenade at the Archduke's car. The driver accelerated when he saw the object flying towards him, but the bomb had a 10-second delay and exploded under the wheel of the fourth car. Two of the occupants, Eric von Merizzi and Count Alexander von Boos-Waldeck, were seriously wounded. About a dozen spectators were also hit by bomb shrapnel. After Čabrinović's bomb missed the car, five other conspirators, including Princip, lost an opportunity to attack because of the heavy crowds and the car's high speed. To avoid capture, Čabrinović swallowed a cyanide capsule and jumped into the Miljacka river to make sure he died. However, the cyanide pill was decayed and only made him sick, and the river was only [...] deep. He was soon hauled out and detained by police.|$|E

60|$|The {{strain on}} Wheeler's arm became intolerable, but somehow he held fast, and just {{then there was}} an appalling crash and roar. He felt himself being dragged backwards, and in another moment fell heavily upon the shingle with Nasmyth across his feet. Blinking about him half dazed, he saw the logs drive by, rolling, grinding, smashing, and falling on one another. Then, as they whirled down the rapid, and the roar they made began to die away, he looked round, and saw several gasping men <b>standing</b> close <b>behind</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
