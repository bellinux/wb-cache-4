25|$|The {{position}} of women under Welsh law differed significantly {{to that of}} their Norman-English contemporaries. A marriage could be established in two basic ways. The normal way was that the woman would be given to a man by her kindred; the abnormal way was that the woman could elope with a man {{without the consent of}} her kindred. In this case her kindred could compel her to return if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>a</b> virgin, but if she was not she could not be compelled to return. If the relationship lasted for seven years she had the same entitlements {{as if she had been}} given by her kin.|$|E
