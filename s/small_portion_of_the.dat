5|$|Box {{huckleberry}} prefers dry, acidic soils, including duff, {{and partial}} shade. Locations on wooded slopes tend to face north; however, the New Bloomfield site faces west. At {{one of the}} Delaware sites, a <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colony extended to the wet margin of a marsh, but most was located on dry, sandy soil upslope.|$|E
5|$|Early {{suggestions}} were to show cutaways {{of just a}} <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> audience, but {{the full}} effect was achieved by only showing {{the back of the}} audience. To save time, most of the audience models were borrowed from the previous Pixar film, Ratatouille. Additionally, Presto's body (from the neck down) is Skinner's lawyer, and the carrot was one of the many food props from that film.|$|E

5|$|Tornadoes vary in {{intensity}} regardless of shape, size, and location, though strong tornadoes are typically larger than weak tornadoes. The association with track length and duration also varies, although longer track tornadoes {{tend to be}} stronger. In the case of violent tornadoes, only a <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> path is of violent intensity, most of the higher intensity from subvortices.|$|E
5|$|After it {{captured}} Kupres, the OG-11 turned south, in {{the direction}} of Gornji Malovan, Donji Malovan and Šuica. The attack, spearheaded by the 9th Armoured Battalion, reached Gornji Malovan on 10 April, the day Robert Zadro was killed. Fighting continued around Kupres until 11 April. Most of the Bosnian Croat TO troops, formally reorganised as the Croatian Defence Council (Hrvatsko vijeće obrane – HVO) on 8 April, withdrew from the Kupres Plateau towards Šuica, while a <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> troops was forced to retreat via the Mount Cincar towards Livno.|$|E

5|$|In 1979 Colalucci {{undertook}} {{a series of}} experiments to discover the right approach {{for the restoration of}} the frescoes of the Sistine Chapel. The investigation began by testing small areas of the wall fresco, Conflict over the Body of Moses by Matteo de Lecce, which had similar physical and chemical attributes to the painting techniques employed on Michelangelo's frescoes. Trials to find the right solvents were continued on a <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Eleazar and Matthan lunette.|$|E
5|$|NY45 runs {{parallel}} to the <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Garden State Parkway (GSP) that enters New York. Officially this portion is considered {{an extension of the}} New York State Thruway. While NY45 never intersects the GSP, it provides a link to the parkway. South of the New Jersey border in Bergen County, CR73 intersects the GSP, and in New York, NY45 intersects CR41, which intersects the parkway. Through Chestnut Ridge (where it is known as Chestnut Ridge Road, just as CR73, its southern extension, is in New Jersey), it crosses the New York State Thruway.|$|E
5|$|The Australian {{contribution}} to the Battle of Normandy involved more than 3,000 military personnel serving under British command. The majority of these personnel {{were members of the}} Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), though smaller numbers of Australians serving with the Royal Navy and British Army also participated in the fighting prior to and after the Allied landings on 6 June 1944. While all the RAAF units based in the United Kingdom (UK) took part in the battle, Australians made up only a <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Allied force.|$|E

5|$|The Court's {{caseload}} {{continued to}} grow over time. In 1881 the general assembly approved {{the creation of a}} five-member panel of commissioners to assist the justices in administrative tasks. Even this was not enough to handle the load. In 1891 the Appellate Court of Indiana was created to handle cases of lower importance. At first the appellate court only took a <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Supreme Court's caseload, but its responsibility gradually increased.|$|E
5|$|The ancient trade city of Phlan {{has fallen}} into impoverished ruin. Now only a <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city remains {{inhabited}} by humans, who {{are surrounded by}} evil creatures. To rebuild the city and clean up the Barren River, the city council of New Phlan has decided to recruit adventurers to drive the monsters from the neighboring ruins. Using bards and publications, they spread tales of the riches waiting to be recovered in Phlan, which draws the player's party to these shores by ship.|$|E
5|$|The forest {{contains}} {{four areas}} of pristine wilderness that have remained largely untouched by human {{activities such as}} mining, logging, and road and building construction. The four regions include the North Absaroka, Washakie, Fitzpatrick and Popo Agie Wildernesses. Additionally, a <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness extends into the extreme northwestern part of the forest, along the Montana border. In Shoshone National Forest, , constituting 56percent of the forest is designated wilderness. The wilderness designation provides a much higher level of land protection and prohibits any alterations by man to the resource.|$|E

5|$|This {{portion of}} the route of I-8 was {{originally}} part of the proposed state system of highways in 1921. By 1926, this section {{became part of the}} cross-country highway US80. The route was not paved at this time, but was a gravel road along the entire corridor. By 1928, the portion of I-8 between Gila Bend and Casa Grande was designated as SR84. A <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highway was paved near Yuma and SR84 was under construction by the next year. SR84 was completed by 1930, but not paved, and the segment of US80 between Aztec and Sentinel had been paved.|$|E
5|$|When Nintendo {{published}} {{the game in}} North America, the packaging design featured a <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> box cut away to reveal the unique gold-colored cartridge. In 1988, The Legend of Zelda sold two million copies. Nintendo of America sought to keep its strong base of fans; anyone who purchased a game and sent in a warranty card {{became a member of}} the Fun Club, whose members got a four-, eight- and eventually 32-page newsletter. Seven hundred copies of the first issue were sent out free of charge, but the number grew as the data bank of names got larger.|$|E
5|$|A transit of Venus {{across the}} Sun takes place when the planet Venus passes {{directly}} between the Sun and a superior planet, becoming visible against (and hence obscuring a <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of)</b> <b>the</b> solar disk. During a transit, Venus {{can be seen}} from Earth as a small black disk moving across the face of the Sun. The duration of such transits is usually several hours (the transit of 2012 lasted 6 hours and 40 minutes). A transit is similar to a solar eclipse by the Moon. While the diameter of Venus is more than 3 times that of the Moon, Venus appears smaller, and travels more slowly across the face of the Sun, because it is much farther away from Earth.|$|E

5|$|Admittedly, Diocletian's praetorian prefects—Afranius Hannibalianus, Julius Asclepiodotus, and Aurelius Hermogenianus—aided in {{regulating}} the flow and presentation of such paperwork, but the deep legalism of Roman culture kept the workload heavy. Emperors in the forty years preceding Diocletian's reign had not managed these duties so effectively, and their output in attested rescripts is low. Diocletian, by contrast, was prodigious in his affairs: there are around 1,200 rescripts {{in his name}} still surviving, and these probably represent only a <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total issue. The sharp {{increase in the number}} of edicts and rescripts produced under Diocletian's rule has been read as evidence of an ongoing effort to realign the whole Empire on terms dictated by the imperial center.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{nomenclature}} of Diet (Assembly or Parliament), {{this institution}} should {{in no way}} be construed as a broadly, or popularly, elected group of representatives. Many of the states did not have constitutions, and those that did, such as the Duchy of Baden, based suffrage on strict property requirements which effectively limited suffrage to a <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> male population. Furthermore, this impractical solution did not reflect the new status of Prussia in the overall scheme. Although the Prussian army had been dramatically defeated in the 1806 Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, it had made a spectacular comeback at Waterloo. Consequently, Prussian leaders expected to play {{a pivotal role in}} German politics.|$|E
5|$|However, Sterling Products did not market Panadol in the United States {{or other}} {{countries}} where Bayer Aspirin still dominated the aspirin market. Other firms began selling acetaminophen drugs, most significantly, McNeil Laboratories with liquid Tylenol in 1955, and Tylenol pills in 1958. By 1967, Tylenol was available without a prescription. Because {{it did not}} cause gastric irritation, acetaminophen rapidly displaced much of aspirin's sales. Another analgesic, anti-inflammatory drug was introduced in 1962: ibuprofen (sold as Brufen in the U.K. and Motrin in the U.S.). By the 1970s, aspirin had a relatively <b>small</b> <b>portion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pain reliever market, and in the 1980s sales decreased even more when ibuprofen became available without prescription.|$|E
