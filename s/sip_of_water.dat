The most famous quip about this issue was uttered by John Ritter, who told the New York Observer when they asked him about the controversy: [...] "I've requested that Nickelodeon air both versions, edited and unedited, because sometimes you feel like a nut, and sometimes you don't" [...] (quoting an advertising jingle for Almond Joy and Mounds candy bars). The incident was also brought up during a [...] "Celebrity Secrets" [...] comedy bit on Late Night with Conan O'Brien in the late 1990s, where a nervous-acting Ritter jokingly says [...] "Somebody asked me if I did that on purpose...", after taking a nervous <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> he responds [...] "You bet I did!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Bhagavata Purana, Ambarisha {{was a great}} {{devotee of}} Vishnu who adhered firmly to the truth. He {{performed}} a yajna with such great devotional fervour that Narayana was pleased to bless him with his Sudarshana Chakra("Sudarshana" [...] meaning [...] "good-looking" [...] or [...] "beautiful"), as a shield of protection over him. Once, Ambarisha performed a religious rite known as the Ekadashi and Dvadashi vrata, for 1 year(i.e. the king would fast on the 11th day of every lunar month and break his fast the next day). After observing this practice for a year, he took up a final fast of 3 days and nights to conclude the rite. As the moment for breaking this fast drew near, sage Durvasa arrived where Ambarisha was and the king received him with due respect. Durvasa agreed to the king's request to be his honoured guest and asked the king to wait until he had finished his bath in the river Yamuna. The auspicious moment soon arrived when the king had to break his fast to fulfill his vow, but Durvasa had not yet returned from his bath. Ambarisha was in a dilemma, as, on the one hand, it was impolite to take food before serving a guest, but on the other, {{the time had come}} for the fast to be broken. After consulting his priests, the king broke his fast by taking a <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and awaited Durvasa's arrival to offer him food.|$|E

2500|$|Of {{course he}} could not get the {{materials}} for his lengthy discourses [...] "all out of his own head" [...] but he knew whence there was a perfect mine of such matter, and thence he provided himself with supplies. He brought into the House from the Library bundles of parliamentary papers and Blue Books, and from these he proceeded to read copious extracts. Once when he had been at his work for more than two hours, without a pause – except to take an occasional <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> – the chairman (the House being in Committee), thought to get him to resume his seat by telling him that his observations had become almost inaudible and unintelligible to the chair. Mr. Biggar tendered respectful apologies, said he felt conscious that his voice was growing somewhat indistinct, remarked that he was at rather too great a distance from the chair, but said he would be happy to improve matters by drawing nearer. Thereupon he gathered up his books and papers and moved up, with all the ease and confidence in the world, to the front bench on the opposition side, facing the table of the house – a place reserved by immemorial custom for ex-ministers and their leading supporters. Then, before resuming the thread, or rather the chain-cable- of his discourse, he informed the astonished functionary that if there was any part of his argument which had not reached his ears, he was quite willing to go over it again.|$|E

50|$|St Moling {{performed}} many miracles. He was Archbishop of Ferns. He {{returned to}} Carlow to his father's royal homestead where {{he built a}} monastery. It was here he died and was buried in Tigh Moling in 646 AD. This well has been a place of pilgrimage over the years. People have paid visits to the well every Saturday in May.

50|$|Prolonged {{stay in a}} sauna {{may lead}} to the loss of {{electrolytes}} from the body, as after vigorous exercise. The risk of dehydration leading to heat stroke may be reduced by regular <b>sipping</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> or isotonic drinks, but not alcohol, during the sauna. Sauna bathing and heavy drinking of alcoholic beverages, and also sauna bathing during alcohol withdrawal phase can undoubtedly create real health risks. In essentially all cases of death associated with saunas in Finland, the victim had diabetes, a heart condition or other serious chronic disease. More than 50% were men over the age of 50, and 30% were over 70. Most were also intoxicated.|$|R
60|$|To {{pass the}} first day there was not difficult. The novelty of the {{position}} was great; {{the interest of the}} thing immense. Indefinite hopes of the future were strong, and they had plenty to say and speculate about during the passing hours. When night came, preparation was made for departure. The provision bags were slung, a moderate <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> indulged in, and they set forth, after a very brief prayer by Stevenson, that God would guide them safely on their way.

Indeed, once we did see it, green and shining, not more than three miles away, but when we got to the head of the hill beyond which it should lie we found that the vision was only a mirage, and our hearts nearly broke with disappointment. Oh! to men dying of thirst, that mirage was indeed a cruel mockery.|$|E

Physical examination revealed that the animal was dehydrated. Tenderness was appreciable on abdominal palpation while a firm, painful mass was felt in the mid-caudal abdomen. The clinical history and physical examination was suggestive of intestinal intussusception. Later on an ultrasound examination revealed a sausage-shaped mass with folded layers of intestinal wall. The intussusception was found to be ileocolic on laparotomy. Resection and end-to-end anastomosis was performed.

A nibble of grass, and she waded far out from shore to sip there; then back, with a nod to a lily pad, and a sip nearer the brook. Finally she meandered a long way up the shore out of sight, and when I picked up the paddle to go, she came back again. Truly a Wandergeist of the woods, like the plover of the coast, who never knows what he wants, nor why he circles about so, nor where he is going next.|$|E
60|$|In any case, how {{unsatisfactory}} is the mosquitoes' existence, {{and what}} a curious position they occupy in nature! Let us suppose that, owing to some great change in {{the conditions of the}} earth, rapacious birds were no longer able to capture prey, and that, by a corresponding change in their organizations, they were able to subsist on the air they breathed, with perhaps an occasional green leaf and a <b>sip</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> and yet retained the old craving for solid food, and the old predatory instincts and powers undiminished; they would be in the position of mosquitoes in the imago state. And if then fifty or a hundred individuals were to succeed every year in capturing something and making one hearty meal, these few fortunate diners would bear about the same proportion to all the raptors on the globe as the mosquitoes that succeed in sucking blood to their unsuccessful fellows. In the case of the hawks, the effect of the few meals on the entire rapacious family or order would certainly be nil; and it is impossible to believe for a moment that the comparatively infinitesimal amount of blood sucked by mosquitoes can. serve to invigorate the species. The wonder is that the machinery, which accomplishes nothing, should continue in such perfect working order.|$|E
