In order for SCEL to ‘support leadership development at all levels for education practitioners across Scotland’ (SCEL, online) an initial <b>scoping</b> <b>exercise</b> of the educational leadership development needs of the staff who meet the Standard for Childhood Practice Revised (SSSC, 2015) in the Early Years sector, now {{referred to as the}} Early Learning and Childcare sector (ELC) (Children and Young People (Scotland) Act 2014) 1, was commissioned in May 2015. This <b>scoping</b> <b>exercise</b> seeks to consider any adaptations and enhancements required to SCEL’s Framework for Educational Leadership (FEL), which is an online resource launched in September 2015 at the Scottish Learning Festival, {{to meet the needs of}} the Early Learning and Childcare workforce. The commissioning of the <b>scoping</b> <b>exercise</b> is an acknowledgement of the ongoing professionalisation and upskilling of the ELC workforce and demonstrates SCEL’s commitment to the incorporation of the ELC sector at the foundation stage of the FEL’s development. Further, SCEL is committed to cross sector involvement and acknowledges the important and crucial role of ELC in the lifelong learning agenda. This <b>scoping</b> <b>exercise</b> therefore is intended to identify issues which need to be addressed in order to meet the needs of this specific group and to identify gaps in SCEL’s work plans.

40|$|Background: Public sector {{organizations}} worldwide {{are engaging}} with social media {{as part of}} a growing e-Government agenda. These include government departments of health, public health agencies and state-funded healthcare and research organizations. Although examples of social media in health have been described in the literature, little is known about their overall scope or how they are achieving the objectives of e-Government. A systematic literature review is underway to capture and synthesize existing evidence on the adoption, use and impacts of social media in the public health sector. A series of parallel <b>scoping</b> <b>exercises</b> has taken place to examine (1) relevant existing systematic reviews, to assess their focus, breadth and fit with our review topic (2) existing concepts related to e-Government, public health and the public health sector, to assess how semantic complexity might influence the review process and (3) the results of pilot searches, to examine the fit of social media within the e-government and health literatures. The methods and observations of the <b>scoping</b> <b>exercises</b> are reported in this protocol, alongside the methods and interim results for the systematic review itself. Objectives: The systematic review has three main objectives: To capture the corpus of published studies on the uses of social media by public health organizations; to classify the objectives for which social media have been deployed in these contexts and the methods used; and to analyse and synthesize evidence of the uptake, use and impacts of social media on various outcomes. Methods: A set of <b>scoping</b> <b>exercises</b> were undertaken, to inform the search strategy and analytic framework. Searches have been carried out in Medline, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science and the Scopus international electronic databases, and appropriate grey literature sources. Articles published between 01 / 01 / 2004 and 12 / 07 / 2015 were included. There was no restriction by language. One reviewer has independently screened citations generated by the search terms and is extracting data from the selected articles. A second author is cross-checking the outputs to ensure the fit of selected articles with the inclusion criteria and appropriate data extraction. A PRISMA flow diagram will enable transparency and replicability. Results: Scoping work revealed that the literature on social media for e-government in the public health sector is complicated by heterogeneous terminologies and concepts, although studies at the intersection of these three topics exist. Not all types of e-government are evident in the healthcare literature. Interim results suggest that most relevant articles focus on usage alone. Conclusions: Public health organizations may be taking it for granted that social media deliver benefits, rather than attempting to evaluate their adoption or impacts. Published taxonomies of e-government hold promise for organizing and interpreting the review results. The systematic review is underway and completion is expected in the beginning of 2016...|$|R
40|$|Electrospinning is a {{relatively}} simple method of producing nanofibres. Currently there is no method to predict the characteristics of electrospun fibres produced {{from a wide range}} of polymer/solvent combinations and concentrations without first measuring a number of solution properties. This paper shows how artificial neural networks can be trained to make electrospinning predictions using only commonly available prior knowledge of the polymer and solvent. Firstly, a probabilistic neural network was trained to predict the classification of three possibilities: no fibres (electrospraying); beaded fibres; and smooth fibres with > 80 % correct predictions. Secondly, a generalised neural network was trained to predict fibre diameter with an average absolute percentage error of 22. 3 % for the validation data.

30|$|Resolving {{conflicts}} {{during the}} pre-assessment and assessment phase requires deliberation among knowledge holders. The formats listed {{in this category}} provide opportunities for experts (not necessarily scientists) to assess and discuss the main characteristics of the risk under investigation. The aim of an epistemic discourse {{is to find the}} most adequate description or explanation of a phenomenon (for example, which physical impacts are to be expected by the emission of specific substances?). Formats that promise to meet these requirements are expert hearings, expert workshops, science workshops, expert panels or advisory committees, or consensus conferences as practised in the medical field. If anecdotal knowledge is needed, one can refer to focus groups, panels of volunteers, and simple surveys. More sophisticated methods of reducing complexity for difficult risk issues include Delphi methods (explained below), group Delphi, meta-analytical workshops, and <b>scoping</b> <b>exercises.</b> The most frequently used formats for resolving conflicts about complex relationships are described in the following sections.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} individual choice {{in the theory of}} distribution. It is demonstrated that an empirically tractable model of earnings can be derived from learning theory {{in the absence of the}} rational choice or investment paradigm. The paper suggests that, in the context of an imperfectly competitive labour market, the primary role of learning on-the-job is as a labour augmenting input to the production process. In such a context therefore, there is little <b>scope</b> for <b>exercising</b> individual rational choice. Accordingly, the paper concludes that the human capital, post-school, 'self-investment' hypothesis has limited application to the theory of income distribution. ...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: This {{exploratory}} project {{aimed to}} provide an up-to-date list of global midwifery research priorities to inform the International Confederation of Midwives' (ICM) research strategy for development of its research agenda. DESIGN: An online survey conducted in 2014 asked ICM Research Advisory Networking members (who then disseminated it to a wider midwifery research interest group) to grade the importance of research priorities and provide further suggestions. Research priorities listed were based on those identified in previous <b>scoping</b> <b>exercises</b> and a recent literature review. FINDINGS: Two hundred seventy-one respondents from 37 countries completed the questionnaire including midwifery practitioners, researchers, lecturers, and service providers. Promotion of normal birth, prevention of maternal and fetal/neonatal morbidity and mortality, and psychosocial aspects of maternity care were identified by the respondents as the top three important themes. Subanalysis by country, region, and continent found promotion of normal birth the greatest priority in more resourced regions, whereas prevention of maternal and fetal/neonatal morbidity and mortality {{was the most important}} research priority in less resourced locations. CONCLUSION: This study provides a systematic global mapping of research priorities from midwives' perspectives which will inform the ICM research agenda. Geographical variation in key research priorities reflect midwives working in very different settings with specific local health and resource related challenges such as staff shortages, human immunodeficiency virus, or obesity. Future research should aim to address these priorities to improve maternal and infant health. Limited number of respondents from some geographical areas should be borne in mind when interpreting the global implications and further research with an optimized scoping for inclusion is required to ensure adequate representativeness from all countries...|$|R
