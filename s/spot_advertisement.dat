40|$|What is ‘legitimacy’? Is {{legitimation}} {{possible through}} non-linguistic modes? These {{are the key}} theoretical questions with which this study is concerned. It explores them in conjunction with an analysis of American political <b>spot</b> <b>advertisements.</b> These ads are situated at the nexus between legitimation and multimodality, and their relevance to contemporary politics {{on the world stage}} is reflected in the immense financial and skilled resources which have been — and continue to be — devoted to them. A historical perspective into legitimation, multimodality and the attendant concepts of rationality and irrationality is given, followed by a discussion challenging the assumed rational role accorded to language. So challenged, the discussion moves to looking at the pairing of multimodality and politics; first from a historical viewpoint, and then from a more contemporary one. The role of myth, {{in the form of the}} American Dream, is investigated, leading to discussion of political appropriation, branding, tangibility, affordances and the (im) possibility of restricting interpretation. Spot ads are analysed with a specific focus: first on modal salience, and secondly on how the semiotic richness of the concept of nature is exploited for purposes of legitimation...|$|R
