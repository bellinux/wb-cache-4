2500|$|The PDSA {{noted that}} she {{protected}} thousands of human lives {{as part of}} her assignments. On her last mission in 2012, when she was on patrol in Afghanistan, <b>she</b> <b>sniffed</b> out a 30-pound (13.6-kilogram) IED and was continuing her search when she lost one of her legs when another IED detonated underneath her. Cpl. Juan Rodriguez, her handler, thought she had been killed, but was able to rescue her. He administered first aid, and Lucca was then airlifted to Germany for medical treatment and rehabilitation. [...] Ten days after the explosion, she was walking again. Following her recovery from her injury, Lucca retired. She lives in California with Gunnery Sgt. Chris Willingham and his family.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sniffed</b> in {{her little}} way, pleased, but pretending to know better.|$|E
60|$|I {{bought her}} a handful, which <b>she</b> <b>sniffed</b> and held to her face with delight.|$|E
50|$|<b>She</b> {{begins to}} <b>sniff</b> the air, and her stomach distends, ready {{to swallow the}} stranger. <b>She</b> <b>sniffs</b> towards the south, then towards the east, and towards all the winds. When <b>she</b> <b>sniffs</b> towards the west she catches Tāwhaki's scent. She calls out 'Are you come with the wind that blows on my skin?' Tāwhaki grunts, and Matakerepō says, 'Oh, it is my {{grandson}} Tāwhaki.' As she says this, her stomach begins to shrink again. If {{he had not been}} from the west wind, she would have swallowed him whole.|$|R
50|$|Matakerepō, {{aware that}} someone is deceiving her, begins to sniff the air, and her stomach distends, ready to swallow the stranger. <b>She</b> <b>sniffs</b> towards the south, and towards all the winds. When <b>she</b> <b>sniffs</b> towards the west she catches Tāwhaki's scent and calls out 'Are you come with the wind that blows on my skin?' Tāwhaki grunts, and Matakerepō says, 'Oh, it is my {{grandson}} Tāwhaki.' Her stomach begins to shrink. Had he not been from the west wind, she would have swallowed him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now that cer'nly is a nice, sweet way {{to congratulate}} friend hubby. Oh, sure! Man lands a job, works {{his head off}} getting it, gets an advance for some new clothes he's simply got to have, and of course {{everybody}} else congratulates him--everybody but his own wife. <b>She</b> <b>sniffs</b> at him--not {{a word about the}} new job, of course. First crack outa the box, she gets busy suspecting him, and says, 'Who you been borrowing of now?' And this after always acting as though she was an abused little innocent that nobody appreciated--" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sniffed</b> in her quaint fashion. It {{was like}} a half-pleased shrug of the shoulders.|$|E
60|$|The ape drew closer, looking {{him over}} carefully. Finally <b>she</b> <b>sniffed</b> at him, {{as though to}} make {{assurance}} doubly sure.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sniffed,</b> {{closed her}} fan with a clatter, and sat down. Mr. Caryll resumed his long chair, and his lordship took the stool.|$|E
60|$|At {{the end of}} {{two minutes}} <b>she</b> rose, <b>sniffing</b> but courageous, herself again. In her misery an idea had come to her. It was quite a simple and obvious idea, but till now it had eluded her.|$|R
6000|$|... "How good!" [...] <b>she</b> cried, <b>sniffing</b> {{the cold}} air. [...] "I'm {{glad you did}} a lot." [...] And she {{stretched}} out her hands eagerly for her plate--"Come back to bed, quick--it's cold." [...] She rubbed her hands together sharply.|$|R
6000|$|... "It’s very {{sensible}} of you, John," [...] said Mr. Turnbull, [...] "and {{a sensible}} girl would appreciate it. Instead of that, <b>she</b> only <b>sniffed</b> when I {{told her how}} careful you always were to wear flannel next to your skin. She said she liked dare-devils." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sniffed</b> superciliously {{and gave}} me the change in small silver, and I had my revenge by biting and ringing every piece of it.|$|E
60|$|Occasionally some flame {{would come}} in pursuit of her errant swain. Mrs. Morel would find a strange girl at the door, and {{immediately}} <b>she</b> <b>sniffed</b> the air.|$|E
60|$|Josie's scorn was {{as funny}} as if a humming-bird scolded at an ostrich, and {{everyone}} laughed as <b>she</b> <b>sniffed</b> at the immortal poet and criticized the gods.|$|E
5000|$|The {{following}} morning, Mrs. Phillips {{says what}} Maddy did was wrong, but apologizes {{as it was}} her over-protection that started all the trouble in the first place. The press sympathizes with them, allowing them to hold a fundraiser the day after earning enough money for Maddy's father's surgery. Even a friend named Mr. Hartmann (John Carroll Lynch) gives a [...] "consultation fee" [...] of $50,000. As Brisbane's irresponsibility got him fired, Hartmann is now {{the president of the}} bank. At the go cart rally after the operation, Gus and Austin make Maddy decide who <b>she</b> loves. <b>She</b> <b>sniffs</b> both of them and causes a debate between them. While they do so, she backs away and they run after her, asking who is a better boyfriend and the movie ends.|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{men have}} learned another useless vice since I left the world, {{and one that}} is filthy also," [...] <b>she</b> said, <b>sniffing</b> at the smoke and waving her hand before her face, whereon I dropped the pipe into my pocket, where, being alight, it burnt a hole in my best {{remaining}} coat.|$|R
6000|$|... "You haven't a penny, Mart, and that's why you're walkin'. Exercise!" [...] <b>She</b> {{tried to}} <b>sniff</b> contemptuously, but succeeded in {{producing}} only a sniffle. [...] "Here, lemme see." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sniffed</b> and was still. The tattered ceiling-cloth {{hung down}} {{almost to the}} level of the table, and there was hardly room to move away from the discovery.|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sniffed,</b> at that, but {{picked up}} her darning and relapsed into silence. The little man was patient. He sat quietly {{in his chair and}} watched her work.|$|E
60|$|Her fair, small brother {{handed her}} the flower dutifully. <b>She</b> <b>sniffed</b> it and gave it without a word to her cousin, for his judgment. He smelled the {{dangling}} flower curiously.|$|E
5000|$|Violeta 'Macarena' Rosu: Aged 14, {{lived at}} the same orphanage as Cristina. Cristina protects Macarena who is quiet and submissive. She is {{addicted}} to Aurolac Paint {{more so than the}} other children. <b>She</b> prefers <b>sniffing</b> paint over food. Macarena doesn’t know her real name, her parents or her birthday. The nickname 'Macarena' derives from the song [...] "Macarena", her favourite, which she loves to dance to.|$|R
60|$|The Duchess {{suppressed}} a <b>sniff.</b> <b>She</b> {{was one of}} those people who regard the Church of England with patronising affection, as if it were something that had grown up in their kitchen garden.|$|R
5000|$|Fink (voiced by Lara Jill Miller) {{is a small}} baby mouse like {{creature}} that assists Professor Venomous. She first appears in [...] "We're Captured," [...] where she is shown to be obsessed with aiding her master {{to the point that}} she refuses to have anyone take his coat. When no one is looking <b>she</b> will <b>sniff</b> his clothes. It is implied that Venomous created her explaining her obsession.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sniffed</b> and was still. The {{broken and}} tattered ceiling-cloth hung down {{almost to the}} level of the table, and there was hardly room to move away from the discovery.|$|E
6000|$|... 'How de-licious this is!' {{cried the}} untravelled Matilda, as they stepped upon {{the deck of}} the 'Lafayette,' and <b>she</b> <b>sniffed</b> the shippy {{fragrance}} that caused Lavinia to gasp and answer darkly,-- ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>sniffed,</b> {{and turned}} scornfully to her glass. George grinned and looked conscious; as he {{swallowed}} a gulp of whiskey it crackled in his throat. The sound annoyed the old lady.|$|E
50|$|She is {{best known}} as the author of Syngress' Wireshark and Ethereal Network Protocol Analyzer Toolkit and Ethereal Packet <b>Sniffing.</b> <b>She</b> speaks at a variety of {{cybersecurity}} conferences and technology events including the SANS Institute and Institute for Applied Network Security.|$|R
50|$|The {{story is}} set in modern Korea. The Match Girl wanders the streets, trying to sell her matches. No one will buy any, and stores kick her out. Cold and hungry, she tries to warm her hands with the matches. A passersby tells her <b>she</b> should <b>sniff</b> the fumes instead, which she does. Feeling no more hunger or cold, she sees the snowflakes turn into cherry petals, {{and in the midst}} of the {{beautiful}} scenery she dies in the street.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sure!" [...] <b>she</b> exclaimed, <b>sniffing</b> with mock scepticism. But {{she felt}} it was so, and her heart quivered with brightness. For many hours she sat still, {{slightly}} conscious of him labouring away, whilst she worked or read her book. And he, with all his soul's intensity directing his pencil, could feel her warmth inside him like strength. They were both very happy so, and both unconscious of it. These times, that meant so much, and which were real living, they almost ignored.|$|R
6000|$|... "I mayn't {{be able to}} {{get away}} till after milking," [...] <b>she</b> <b>sniffed,</b> [...] "but I don't want to miss it. Even a cat's funeral is better than none at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Children together--young and old,' <b>she</b> <b>sniffed,</b> but forbore to {{make any}} new jokes. 'May this present {{hospitality}} restore ye! Hold awhile and I will come to gossip of the high good Hills.' ...|$|E
60|$|Half an hour passed; {{the visitor}} still sat grimly upright. Twice <b>she</b> <b>sniffed</b> slightly, and, with a {{delicate}} handkerchief, pushed up her veil and wiped away the faint {{beginnings of a}} tear.|$|E
50|$|The story {{appears in}} the form of a short anecdote in the {{collection}} of Phaedrus and concerns an old woman who comes across an empty wine jar, the lingering smell of which <b>she</b> appreciatively <b>sniffs</b> and praises, saying 'Oh sweet spirits, I do declare, how excellent you must once have been to have left behind such fine remains!' Phaedrus is playing with the comic stereotype of the drunken old woman, who was a stock figure of both Greek and Roman comedy, as illustrated in the statue here.|$|R
6000|$|... "They'll {{be through}} in a minute. <b>Sniff!</b> <b>She</b> smells good to-night. Dad ships {{a good cook}} ef he do suffer with his brother. It's a full catch today, ain't it?" [...] He pointed at the pens piled high with cod. [...] "What water did ye hev, Manuel?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> heard a <b>sniff</b> {{close behind}} her head as it seemed, and turning, was {{surprised}} to see Hall a dozen feet off on the topmost stair. But in another moment he was beside her. She bent forward and put her hand on the pillow and then under the clothes.|$|R
