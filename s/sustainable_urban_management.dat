40|$|<b>Sustainable</b> <b>urban</b> water <b>management</b> is an {{increasingly}} important socio-political objective, however implementation remains ad hoc. While numerous tools and technologies {{have been developed to}} achieve <b>sustainable</b> <b>urban</b> water <b>management,</b> significant socio-institutional barriers remain. These impediments include, among others, institutional fragmentation, poor political leadership and technological lock-in. Exacerbated by a lack of theory and conceptual frameworks to link <b>sustainable</b> <b>urban</b> water <b>management</b> principles with on-ground execution, these barriers contribute to low levels of system-wide implementation capacity. Institutional capacity building is advocated in the <b>sustainable</b> <b>urban</b> water literature as a strategy to facilitate implementation; however, institutional capacity building has limited ability to provide an overview of regime operation, considered critical for enabling system-wide change. Focusing on processes, actor agency and institutions, the field of governance studies provides a useful perspective for understanding holistic regime operation and change. Yet the environmental governance literature remains contested; many scholars support a network or market governance approach while others advocate for hybrid approaches. Moreover, the governance systems needed for enabling <b>sustainable</b> <b>urban</b> water <b>management</b> have been given limited attention. Therefore, the purpose of this thesis is to develop a guiding framework for <b>sustainable</b> <b>urban</b> water governance. Through an emergent research design, systematically drawing on the perspectives of scholars and leading Australian urban water sustainability practitioners, likely attributes of a <b>sustainable</b> <b>urban</b> water <b>management</b> regime were identified. The attributes were focused through the lens of individual, organisational, inter-organisational relationships, and administrative and regulatory regime components. A comparison of the scholarly and practitioner perspectives, together with governance, regime and institutional literatures, explored which governance modes are most likely to enable <b>sustainable</b> <b>urban</b> water <b>management.</b> Overall, this investigation revealed a suite of likely <b>sustainable</b> <b>urban</b> water <b>management</b> regime attributes that are substantially different from traditional and contemporary practice highlighting the considerable regime change required to enable <b>sustainable</b> <b>urban</b> water <b>management.</b> The scholars supported a network governance approach, similar to current adaptive governance and conceptual scholarly <b>urban</b> water <b>management</b> projections, with interdependent actor relations and largely informal administrative arrangements. In comparison, the practitioners advocated hybrid governance arrangements comprising hierarchical and network modes, including a formal administrative framework, with mutually dependent and interconnected actor relationships to facilitate implementation of site specific <b>sustainable</b> <b>urban</b> water <b>management</b> solutions. Both scholars and practitioners supported using a variety of policy instruments, including market governance instruments. The outcomes of this investigation suggest the hybrid governance approach supported by practitioners extends current scholarship by providing detailed information on regime attributes and operation, which can provide insight for practical implementation of network governance approaches which are supported in current <b>urban</b> water <b>management</b> and adaptive governance literature. Additionally, the hybrid approach offers suggestions for successfully integrating the three ideal governance modes and reducing potential tension among the modes. In practice, the proposed framework could be used to design capacity building programs and policy initiatives drawing on mixed governance approaches. To extend this research and improve insight into regime operation and governance dynamics, future research testing the tentative <b>sustainable</b> <b>urban</b> water governance framework in other locations is required...|$|R

By keeping the accessibility language out of the practice level, older paradigms resist the more informed and people-centred approaches.Focusing on the link between research and practice, the Cost Action TU1002 seeks to find out why accessibility instruments are not more often used in urban planning practice and reflects on how to reduce such implementation gap in planning practice. The existence of accessibility instruments is fairly acknowledged, but practitioners do not appear to have found them useful or usable enough for addressing the tasks of <b>sustainable</b> <b>urban</b> <b>management.</b> This Cost Action TU1002 is bringing together developers of accessibility instruments all over Europe and Australia to work with land use and transportation planning practitioners to explore how these instruments can play a more supportive role in enhancing accessibility in European cities and beyond. So far, 24 Accessibility Instruments have been gathered, analysed and described so as to understand in detail their characteristics, planning issues addressed and specific purposes, according to the developers’ view. In turn, these instruments are being tested in a series of workshops with multidisciplinary teams of practitioners around Europe addressing the issue of usability from the practitioners’ viewpoint. In doing so, it is expected that the additional knowledge on the potential of accessibility instruments for urban planning practice will have beneficial impacts on urban quality and decision making on urban land use patterns.|$|E

Urban forests responses to this change should be framed appropriately in our interpretation of urban forest sustainability and its management. While the usual approach to address climate change in the urban forest setting has concentrated in climate mitigation, chiefly greenhouse gas emission reduction, much is to be desired about climate adaptation. It is argued here that any <b>sustainable</b> <b>urban</b> forest <b>management</b> framework fails to address the deep implications of urban forest sustainability {{if it does not}} address the climate question. This paper demonstrates that climate mitigation and adaptation can be integrated in a <b>sustainable</b> <b>urban</b> forest <b>management</b> framework that is inclusive of climate considerations and strives to sustain a strong array of environmental, social and economic values. It is shown here that such a framework may contain management practices that consider the net effect of both decreasing vulnerability and emissions.

During dry weather this system will be handling only the greywater and making the latter available as reclaimed water for reuse in place of the fresh water supply. During wet weather, the system will be taking care of (collection and treatment) both the storm water and the greywater, and the excess of the treated water will be disposed off through groundwater recharging.

The objective of this research was to estimate fractional vegetation cover from a Landsat ETM+ image with sub-pixel classification, and to compare accuracies obtained with multiple stepwise regression analysis, linear spectral unmixing and multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) at the level of meaningful urban spatial entities. Despite the small, but nevertheless statistically significant differences at pixel level between the alternative approaches, the spatial pattern of vegetation cover and estimation errors is clearly distinctive at neighbourhood level. At this spatially aggregated level, a simple regression model appears to attain sufficient accuracy. For mapping at a spatially more detailed level, the MLP seems to be the most appropriate choice.
