40|$|Background & aims The {{effect of}} human milk storage in the {{refrigerator}} has been investigated with regard to sensory changes and modifications to the molecular composition of the milk odour-active volatiles. Methods In the present study, characteristic odorants from fat oxidation, known from previous studies, as well as free fatty acids were quantified as representative marker substances by means of stable isotope dilution assays of fresh milk samples and milk samples stored at + 4 °C for one and three days, respectively. Results Sensory evaluation showed that rancid and sweaty odour attributes were generated during storage, resulting in an unpleasant aroma profile for adults; however, odour changes were not as pronounced as those observed {{in our previous study}} for freeze storage. Fatty and buttery odour notes and a cooked milk-like smell were also generated. In total eight odorants from fat oxidation were determined and some potent odorants showed slight concentration increases. Moreover, five free fatty acids were determined and these all showed drastic concentration increases, even after storage for just one day.

40|$|Mycotoxins are {{metabolites}} of moulds {{that may}} be found in food and feed of plant and animal origin. This paper gives a short review of the agronomical methods and food and feed <b>storage</b> <b>recommendations</b> for the prevention of mould contamination. It describes the practical methods of feed decontamination and the use of feed additives where mycotoxin contamination prevention has failed. However, these methods should be avoided as much as possible because they may increase the cost of production, reduce the nutritional value of feed, and leave residues of mycotoxins or their toxic metabolites. Since there is no universal and reliable method of feed decontamination for all mycotoxins, the paper stresses the importance of preventive measures. KEY WORDS: aflatoxins, decontamination, ergot alkaloids, fumonisins, ochratoxins, trichothecenes According to the evaluation of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 25 % of the world cereal production is contaminated by mycotoxins (1). Food and feed are usually contaminated by more than one mycotoxin, because a certain strain of moulds may produce different mycotoxins. Residues of mycotoxins may also be found in food of animal origin (meat, milk, eggs, and cheese) as the consequence of feed contamination. Mycotoxins are toxic compounds, {{and some of them are}} also mutagenic, genotoxic, carcinogenic, or teratogenic. In mild climates, the most frequent toxicogenic moulds in food and feed are the species of genera Fusarium and Penicillium.

The increased consumption and consequently {{the need for}} greater consumer satisfaction {{have resulted in the}} introduction of supersweet sweetcorn. The present study, aimed to report on the effects of various postharvest factors on biochemical and texture-related characteristics of supersweet sweetcorn cultivars as current knowledge is still incomplete. Validation and optimisation of commonly used methods for the analysis of target compounds in sweetcorn was also an objective of the current work. The methods developed for the analysis of the target analytes (viz. ferulic acid, individual carotenoids, non-structural carbohydrates and vitamin C) were considered suitable. However, the Folin-Ciocalteu assay and the ferric ion reducing power assay, as methods for the {{determination of}} total phenolic content and total antioxidant capacity of sweetcorn, respectively, were shown as not appropriate for sweetcorn analysis. Documentation on firmness and biochemical compounds as affected by cooking and the interaction with various storage conditions is still limited. The current project was the first to extensively monitor quality changes in firmness, and other quality attributes under cooking conditions. Results revealed that increased cooking time resulted in greater ferulic acid content and a significant decline in firmness and qualityrelated target analytes such as L-ascorbic acid and carotenoids, yet no change in sugars was observed. The firmest kernels were reported to be those located in {{the central part of the}} cobs, which is also the preferred edible portion for consumers. Surprisingly, spatial sugar profiles indicated higher total sugar content in non-edible tissues (viz. core and shank), rather than kernels and the implications of this are discussed. Predictably, higher storage temperature and the longer storage period resulted in lower quality, yet genotype, controlled atmosphere and origin of the cobs were significant sources of variation for sugar content and firmness of kernels. The presence of husks (i. e. non-removal) on sweetcorn cobs promoted the retention of sugar content and colour over <b>storage.</b> <b>Recommendations</b> for improved methods for the measurement of target analytes leading to valid conclusions about optimum storage conditions are also included...|$|E
40|$|For the {{detection}} and identification of explosive residues, surfaces of interest are typically sampled by swabbing or solvent wash. The current use of sequential swabbing protocols that separately target organic and inorganic compounds is under threat {{due to the}} increased use of improvised organic/inorganic explosive mixtures. An optimised swabbing procedure, using commercially available skin cleansing alcohol wipes, was developed to maximize the collection of both organic and inorganic explosive residues in a single step. Using six representative compounds (TNT, RDX, PETN, TATP, ammonium nitrate, and sodium chlorate) and four different substrates (glass, plastic, aluminium foil and laminate), the collection efficiency of the alcohol wipes was compared to the results obtained using conventional cotton swabs, polyester swabs, and a direct solvent wash (used as a control). The alcohol wipes demonstrated better overall performance in the recovery of both the organic and inorganic compounds from all test surfaces. The compositions of a mixture of three organic solvents (acetone, acetonitrile and methanol) and water for a single-step solvent extraction of both organic and inorganic representative compounds from the alcohol wipes was investigated. In addition, the study included the evaluation and optimisation of a subsequent solid-phase extraction (SPE) clean-up procedure for the wipes extracts utilising several solid-phase extraction cartridges (both commercially available and prepared in-house). The application of a polyester alcohol wipe as a universal swab, followed by extraction with 60 % v/v methanol/water and clean-up with a Nexus SPE cartridge, was proposed as the final optimised protocol for the combined recovery and clean-up of organic and inorganic explosive residues. The stability of the six representative compounds on polyester wipes and in 60 % v/v methanol/water extracts, stored over 30 days in clear and amber glass vials at three different temperatures, was assessed in order to establish <b>storage</b> <b>recommendations</b> in conjunction with the final proposed protocol. The retention of all six target compounds on a glass surface at two different storage temperatures was included for an estimation of the maximum time that the explosive material could still be detected and recovered from a stored exhibit. The results from the stability study suggested that, after sampling, the wipes should be stored in a dark and low temperature environment. Also, after processing using the proposed protocol, the extracts should be stored in a similar fashion. The results from the retention study of the six target compounds on the glass substrate suggested that exhibits should be stored at the lowest temperature possible to minimise the loss of any TNT or TATP (or similar target compounds) that might be contained within the sample...|$|E

However, lack of existing research in secured ECG distribution forces patient privacy under serious threat. Moreover, without adopting secured ECG transmission and <b>storage,</b> HIFAA <b>recommendations</b> for patient privacy are being compromised. This paper presents a new ECG obfuscation method, which uses cross correlation based template matching approach to detect all ECG features followed by corruption of those features with added noises. Without {{the knowledge of the}} templates used for feature matching and the noise, the obfuscated features can not be reconstructed. Therefore, three templates and three noises for P wave, QRS Complex and T wave comprise the key, which is only 0. 4 %- 0. 9 % of the original ECG file size. Only authored doctors possessing this key can reconstruct the original signal. Key distribution is extremely efficient and fast due to small size. Moreover, if the obfuscated ECG reaches to the wrong hand (hacker), it would appear as regular ECG without encryption. Therefore, traditional decryption techniques including powerful brute force attack are useless against this obfuscation. Finally, with unimaginably high number of noise combinations the security strength of the presented method is very high...|$|R
40|$|Elevated {{atmospheric}} CO 2 concentration (eCO 2) has {{the potential}} to increase vegetation carbon storage if increased net primary production causes increased long-lived biomass. Model predictions of eCO 2 effects on vegetation carbon storage depend on how allocation and turnover processes are represented. We used data from two temperate forest free-air CO 2 enrichment (FACE) experiments to evaluate representations of allocation and turnover in 11 ecosystem models. Observed eCO 2 effects on allocation were dynamic. Allocation schemes based on functional relationships among biomass fractions that vary with resource availability were best able to capture the general features of the observations. Allocation schemes based on constant fractions or resource limitations performed less well, with some models having unintended outcomes. Few models represent turnover processes mechanistically and there was wide variation in predictions of tissue lifespan. Consequently, models did not perform well at predicting eCO 2 effects on vegetation carbon <b>storage.</b> Our <b>recommendations</b> to reduce uncertainty include: use of allocation schemes constrained by biomass fractions; careful testing of allocation schemes; and synthesis of allocation and turnover data in terms of model parameters.

2500|$|The {{treatment}} for permanent teeth consists of replantation, immediately if possible. Deciduous teeth {{should not be}} replanted due {{to the risk of}} damaging the permanent tooth germ. Immediate replantation ensures the best possible prognosis but is not always possible since more serious injuries may be present. Studies have shown that teeth that are protected in a physiologically ideal media can be replanted within 15 minutes to one hour after the accident with good prognosis. The success of delayed replantation depends on the vitality of the cells remaining on the root surface. In normal conditions, a tooth is connected to the socket by means of the periodontal ligament. When a tooth is knocked out, that ligament stretches and splits in half. Maintaining the vitality of the cells that remain attached to the root surface is the key to success following replantation. Years ago, it was thought that the key to maintaining root cell vitality was keeping the knocked-out tooth wet, thus giving rise to <b>storage</b> media <b>recommendations</b> such as water, the mouth and milk. Recent research has shown that one of the key elements for maintaining vitality is storing the tooth in an environment that closely resembles the original socket environment. This environment is one that has the proper [...] osmolality (cell pressure), pH, nutritional metabolites and glucose. There are scientifically designed storage media that provide this environment. These storage media are now available in retail products. Use of devices that incorporate the ideal storage media and protective apparatuses have increased the success rate of replanted knocked-out teeth to over 90% when used within sixty minutes of the accident.|$|R

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} the work performed under contract DE-FC 26 - 03 NT 41743. The primary {{objective of this}} study was to develop tools that would allow Underground Gas Storage (UGS) operators to use wellhead electronic flow measurement (EFM) data to quickly and efficiently identify trends in well damage over time, thus aiding in the identification of potential causes of the damage. Secondary objectives of this work included: (1) To assist UGS operators in the evaluation of hardware and software requirements for implementing an EFM system similar to the one described in this report, and (2) To provide a cost-benefit analysis framework UGS operators can use to evaluate economic benefits of installing wellhead EFM systems in their particular fields. Assessment of EFM data available for use, and selection of the specific study field are reviewed. The various EFM data processing tasks, including data collection, organization, extraction, processing, and interpretation are discussed. The process of damage assessment via pressure transient analysis of EFM data is outlined and demonstrated, including such tasks as quality control, semi-log analysis, and log-log analysis of pressure transient test data extracted from routinely collected EFM data. Output from pressure transient test analyses for 21 wells is presented, and the interpretation of these analyses to determine the timing of damage development is demonstrated using output from specific study wells. Development of processing and interpretation modules to handle EFM data interpretation in horizontal wells is also a presented and discussed. A spreadsheet application developed to aid underground gas storage operators in the selection of EFM equipment is presented, discussed, and used to determine the cost benefit of installing EFM equipment in a gas <b>storage</b> field. <b>Recommendations</b> for future work related to EFM in gas storage fields are presented and discussed...|$|R
