5|$|Following {{the arrival}} of the {{relieving}} force, Pyrrhus lifted the siege and prepared to winter in Laconia. However, he was approached by an Argive citizen who requested his assistance in overthrowing the government of Argos. Seeking {{to take advantage of the}} opportunity, Antigonus took his army to Argos, being harried along the way by the Spartans. Whilst attempting to seize Argos by night, Pyrrhus was <b>set</b> <b>upon</b> by his Argive opponents as well as the Spartans and Antigonus' Macedonians. In the ensuing mêlée, Pyrrhus was slain. His death prompted the capitulation of his army and the reestablishment of a Macedonian hegemony over Greece.|$|E

5|$|For {{the light}} attack role, the RAH-66 {{was to be}} {{furnished}} with various armaments. It was equipped with a single 20mm three-barrel XM301 Gatling gun, which was fixed underneath the nose section. In addition, the RAH-66 was capable of internally carrying a maximum of six AGM-114 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles or up to twelve AIM-92 Stinger air-to-air missiles, which would be evenly divided between a pair of retractable weapons pylons. Beyond the internal munitions stowage, the Comanche could also carry up to four Hellfire missiles or a maximum of eight Stinger missiles externally, <b>set</b> <b>upon</b> on each of its stub wings; however, operations performing with any armaments mounted externally would unavoidably resulted in a reduction {{of the effectiveness of}} the rotorcraft's stealth technologies.|$|E

5|$|Bligh {{hoped to}} find water and food on Tofua, then proceed to the nearby island of Tongatapu to seek help from King Poulaho (whom he knew from his visit with Cook) in {{provisioning}} the boat for a voyage to the Dutch East Indies. Ashore at Tofua, there were encounters with natives who were initially friendly but grew more menacing as time passed. On 2 May, four days after landing, Bligh realised that an attack was imminent. He directed his men back to the sea, shortly before the Tofuans seized the launch's stern rope and attempted to drag it ashore. Bligh coolly shepherded {{the last of his}} shore party and their supplies into the boat.

5|$|His {{retreating}} army were continuously harried by the Spartans {{under the}} command of Areus. By setting ambushes and occupying important positions along the Epiriote line of retreat, the Spartans were able to inflicted significant casualties on Pyrrhus' rearguard of Gauls and Molossians. In an attempt to counter the panic and crumbling morale of his rear which was engaging the Spartans, Pyrrhus sent his son Ptolemy to take command. By doing this, Pyrrhus' hope was that his son's presence would rally the rearguard and give him enough time to extricate the rest of his army from the narrow pass through which they were marching. The battle intensified around Ptolemy's position and he was <b>set</b> <b>upon</b> by a picked Spartan band led by Evaclus. In the fight that ensued, Ptolemy was slain and his remaining troops being overwhelmed by the triumphant Spartans. Upon hearing of his son's death and the disintegration of his rearguard, Pyrrhus charged the Spartans with his Molossian cavalry, killing Evaclus with his own hand before destroying the remainder of his picked Spartan troops. With the defeat of Evaclus' force, Pyrrhus was able to withdraw the rest of his army from Laconia.|$|E
5|$|Maple noted that, unusually—given {{his role}} as a cunning man—Pickingill did not charge for his services, but did receive some money from visitors, and that his {{recorded}} roles included restoring lost property and curing minor ailments, both of which were common practices amongst British cunning folk. According to one account, he cured a woman of rheumatism by transferring the ailment to her father. Maple wrote that Pickingill was known to use cursing and malevolent magic on occasion, something that the folklorist contrasted with the activities of other contemporary cunning folk that he had studied, such as James Murrell. At harvest time, Maple recorded, Pickingill was known to wander around the field threatening to bewitch farm machinery, with many farmers thus offering him beer so that he would leave them alone. He was also recorded as coercing local people to obtain water for him from the village pump by threatening to <b>set</b> <b>upon</b> them white mice, a rodent which in local folklore was associated with misfortune. Another tale that Maple recorded also associated Pickingill with white mice; according to this, a visitor travelled to the cunning man's cottage only to find him lying in bed, with the mice suckling from his nipples.|$|E
5|$|Olid treated González and Las Casas more as honoured guests than as prisoners. Pedro de Briones' {{abandonment}} of Honduras {{resulted in a}} significant weakening of Olid's forces. Las Casas and González Dávila took advantage of this opportunity, and of Olid's excessive trust in his prisoners, to attack Olid and escape from their confinement. Once free, they expected support from Briones. Seizing their opportunity, González and Las Casas <b>set</b> <b>upon</b> Olid one evening and seriously wounded him. Olid managed to escape and hid in an Indian hut, but he was quickly found, and subjected to a rapid trial. Olid was executed by having his throat cut in the plaza at Naco. After the death of Olid, Spanish relations with the natives of Naco deteriorated notably. The Indians were increasingly unwilling to provide the Spanish with food and other supplies, {{and most of the}} Spanish abandoned the settlement and either returned to Mexico or resettled in other parts of Honduras. A court in Mexico subsequently condemned Las Casas and González Dávila for their execution of Olid, but neither was ever punished.|$|E

5|$|According to Fitzgibbons, the rumours {{surrounding}} Cromwell's body {{immediately after}} his death are “merely good yarns born out of over-active imaginations”. One legend claims that he was conveyed secretly to Naseby, the site of his “greatest victory and glory”, for a midnight burial. The field was then ploughed over to hide evidence of the burial. Another legend, written in the 1730s by a John Oldmixon, claims that “a reliable Gentlewoman who attended Cromwell in his last sickness” had said the coffin was sunk in the deepest part of the River Thames the night following Cromwell's death. Fearful of royalists, “it was consulted how to dispose of his Corpse. They could not pretend to keep it for the Pomp of a publick burial...and to prevent its falling into barbarous hands, it was resolved {{to wrap it up}} in lead, to put it aboard a Barge, and sink it in the deepest part of the Thames, which was done the night following Cromwell's death.” In 1664, Samuel Pepys wrote of a story he had heard in which “Cromwell did, in his life, transpose many of the bodies of the Kings of England from one grave to another, and by that means it is not known certainly whether the head that is now <b>set</b> <b>upon</b> a post be that of Cromwell, or one of the Kings”. If this story had any accuracy, Fitzgibbons suggests the irony would be that the posthumous act was possibly carried out on an English monarch rather than Cromwell himself. Another story even suggested that Cromwell's body was substituted for Charles I, adding what Fitzgibbons describes as “an even greater mockery of the events of 30 January 1649”. This story is known to be false; Charles' tomb was opened in 1813, and his remains, including the cut that severed his head, remained as they were in 1649.|$|E
5|$|On 21 April 1914, President Woodrow Wilson {{ordered the}} {{occupation}} of Veracruz. MacArthur joined the headquarters staff that {{was sent to the}} area, arriving on 1 May 1914. He realized that the logistic support of an advance from Veracruz would require the use of the railroad. Finding plenty of railroad cars in Veracruz but no locomotives, MacArthur set out to verify a report that {{there were a number of}} locomotives in Alvarado, Veracruz. For $150 in gold, he acquired a handcar and the services of three Mexicans, whom he disarmed. MacArthur and his party located five engines in Alvarado, two of which were only switchers, but the other three locomotives were exactly what was required. On the way back to Veracruz, his party was <b>set</b> <b>upon</b> by five armed men. The party made a run for it and outdistanced all but two of the armed men, whom MacArthur shot. Soon after, they were attacked by a group of about fifteen horsemen. MacArthur took three bullet holes in his clothes but was unharmed. One of his companions was lightly wounded before the horsemen finally decided to retire after MacArthur shot four of them. Further on, the party was attacked a third time by three mounted men. MacArthur received another bullet hole in his shirt, but his men, using their handcar, managed to outrun all but one of their attackers. MacArthur shot both that man and his horse, and the party had to remove the horse's carcass from the track before proceeding.|$|E
5|$|The British had {{determined}} the Tug Argan gap {{the best possible}} place to make a stand out of the three roadways, and also the most likely invasion route, and thus positioned {{the bulk of the}} army around it. On the British right, to the north of Tug Argan, were three companies of the 3/15 Punjab Regiment, <b>set</b> <b>upon</b> a group of west-facing strongpoints overlooking the rough wilderness that lay beside the road. South of them lay the gap itself, manned by a contingent of Rhodesian troops. They sat upon a line of small hills, named from north to south Black, Knobbly, Mill, Observation, and Castle Hills. These hills, positioned in a row with 2,000–2,500 yard gaps in between, housed machine-gun nests surrounded with light rings of barbed wire and served as the Rhodesians' defensive strongholds and the main defense for the British of the pass. On the British left were another group of Indian troops, located upon the aptly named 'Punjab Ridge' facing directly to the south. Unfortunately for the British, the front was too wide for the troops available, and the gaps between hills too large, leaving the defenses prone to infiltration. Also, due to the hills being in a single line, the position lacked depth. Meanwhile, De Simone, arriving {{at the site of the}} impending battle on 10 August, set his forces directly opposite the British positions. On the left, II Brigade prepared to advance through the wilderness towards the Punjab troops in the north. In the Italian center, XIV Brigade faced the Rhodesian hilltop positions within the pass, and XV Brigade looked north towards Punjab Ridge on the Italian right. Behind them were XIII Brigade and the armored vehicles.|$|E
