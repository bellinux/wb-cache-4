50|$|The vagina is a fibromuscular (made up of fibrous {{and muscular}} tissue) canal {{leading from the}} outside of the body to the cervix of the uterus or womb. It is also {{referred}} to as the birth canal in the context of pregnancy. The vagina accommodates the male penis during sexual intercourse. Semen containing <b>spermatazoa</b> is ejaculated from the male at orgasm, into the vagina potentially enabling fertilization of the egg cell (ovum) to take place.|$|R
40|$|Objective To {{describe}} {{a new technique}} for freezing individ-ually isolated <b>spermatazoa</b> from testicular biopsies, epidid-ymal aspirates and oligospermic semen samples Methods Samples were evaluated {{for the presence of}} motile sperm before cryopreservation. Motile or twitching sperm were isolated with an ICSI needle for single sperm cryo-preservation. Selected sperm were loaded on the High Se-curity Straw (HSV; Irvine Scientific; Irvine,CA), in ~ 0. 5 µl of fluid to facilitate recovery. The sample was also frozen using conventional methodology in cryovials (100 – 1000 µl aliquots). In both freezing techniques, the samples were slow cooled. Test-yolk buffer-glycerol (Irvine) was used as the cryoprotectant. Test-thaws were performed to assess sperm recovery and motility...|$|R
50|$|Reproduction is {{seasonal}} in O. phosphorea, its timing {{related to}} the phases of the moon. Spawning takes place between June and October, at night at two-weekly intervals coinciding with neap tides. Shortly after sunset, worms begin {{to rise to the}} surface. Males usually appear first, the hind part of their body emitting a blue-green light, and periodically discharging a lingering secretion of luminous matter into the water. Females appear soon afterwards, emitting flashes of light, and swimming in small circles on the water surface. Both the body of the female and the secretions it produces are luminous and sometimes a male gyrates on the surface with a female. The display ceases within half an hour of its commencement. Water samples taken in the vicinity of males and females and their luminous secretions contain <b>spermatazoa</b> and eggs respectively.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} phenomena exhibited by swimming microorganisms is the coordination of their beating cilia. Cilia, sometimes called flagella, are the thin filaments used for propulsion by eukaryotic organisms. Figure 1 a shows a sketch of the beating pattern of the two flagella of the green alga Chlamydomonas. The flagella tend to beat in synchrony in a mirror-symmetric manner at a frequency of about 50 Hz, with the periods of synchrony interrupted occasionally by random bursts of asynchronous beating [1]. Coordinated beating occurs {{in a wide variety of}} geometries and organisms. It can occur among hundreds of cilia on a single organism, as in the case of Paramecia, which are covered in cilia that beat together to generate the so-called metachronal waves that sweep along the the surface of the cell and propel it along [2]. Coordinated beating can even occur between flagella on different cells, such as in the case of nearby swimming mammalian <b>spermatazoa</b> [3]...|$|R
40|$|The {{desire to}} have {{children}} {{is more and more}} common in HIV serodiscordant couples. The Academic Medical Centre Amsterdam has developed a new treatment protocol for couples in whom the man is HIV positive. Semen is processed to obtain HIV- 1 free spermatozoa. These spermatozoa are used for IUI treatment. Thus far, 20 serodiscordant couples underwent 76 IUI cycles. An insemination was performed in 50 cycles (66 %). The insemination was cancelled in 26 cycles, because of too many follicles (risk for multiple pregnancy), weekend (no possibilities for virological testing), not enough <b>spermatazoa</b> after preparation, a positive HIV- 1 RNA test and other reasons. 10 out of 20 women became pregnant (50 %), 8 women were on-going pregnant. The clinical and ongoing pregnancy rate per started cycle was 13 % and 11 % respectively. 7 babies have thus far been born and none of the mothers or babies seroconverted within this study period. Larger numbers of patients are necessary to support the safety of this progra...|$|R
40|$|The effedts of methyl {{parathion}} on spermatogenesis, testes and vas deferens in male mice were studied. Mice were administered {{methyl parathion}} intragastrically at the doses of 1. 2 and 4 mg/kg one daily for seven days. Total numbers of spermatozoa, in the cuada epididymis, and percentage showing foreword motility, were measured using a haemocy tometer. Numbers of <b>spermatazoa,</b> sperm motility and weights of testes and vas deferens were then determined at 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 weeks. Methyl parathion caused a significant (P< 0. 01) {{decrease in the}} number of spermatozoa in the epididymis only at the fifth week after the end of administration. Sperm mothility in the methyl parathion treated group was diminished significantly (P< 0. 01) in a concentration-dependent fashion (r= 0. 7) at all time points observed. In contrast to numbers of spermatozoa and sperm motility, weights of testes and vas deferens were apparently unaffected by methyl parathion. We conclude that spermatogenesis in mice was reduced by methyl parathion, which was most likely to act at the spermatocytic stage without changing the weights of testes and vas deferens...|$|R
40|$|Substances {{possessing}} {{various degrees}} of antibacterial activity in vitro have been isolated from host tissues and body fluids. It has been suspected for many years that these or related tissue substances might participate in the nonspecific resistance of host tissues to microbial infection. Early contributions in the field were summarized by Metchnikov (1) and Adam 1 (2). Subsequent work, summarized by Skarnes and Watson (4), has with few exceptions been concerned primarily with extraction and characterization of these antibacterial substances. Particular {{attention has been given}} to the basic proteins and polypeptides (these will be referred to collectively as cationic polypeptides), which are widely distributed among animal tissues and which possess antimicrobial (6 a, 6 b) activity in vitro. The in vitro antibacterial actions of histones (5 - 8, 10, 11), protamines 5, 6, 9, 12), and certain basic tissue polypeptides (13 - 17) have been extensively studied. These substances {{have been found to be}} toxic to a wide range of bacterial species in vitro, under suitable circumstances. They have been isolated from leukocytes, lymphoid tissues, <b>spermatazoa,</b> blood platelets, neoplastic tissues, and othe...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{investigations}} {{showed that}} VLA- 6 integrin present on boar sperm membrane can induce acrosome reaction upon exposure to laminin accumulated in expanded cumuli (Mattioli et al., 1998). To further investigate this novel sperm egg-recognition system, the authors studied {{the distribution of}} VLA- 6 integrin on the membrane of boar sperm throughout capacitation and following acrosome reaction, and analyzed intracellular Ca 2 + changes occurring in spermatozoa exposed to laminin. Immunofluorescent localisation of VLA- 6 revealed a low proportion (nearly 22 %) of positive cells in freshly ejaculated sperm, with integrin mainly concentrated in clustered spots. After 3 hr incubation most of the <b>spermatazoa</b> showed integrin molecules on the membrane, with three different labeling patterns: fluorescence localised {{on the edge of}} the acrosome (58. 2 +/- 14. 2 % of the cells); fluorescence uniformly spread over the whole sperm head (5. 0 +/- 1. 9 %) and finally fluorescence concentrated in clustered spots (7. 6 +/- 5. 6 %), as recorded in freshly ejaculated sperm. Twenty-nine percent of cells did not shaw any distinct fluorescence. Following acrosome reaction sperm with fluorescence on the acrosomal region virtually disappeared and the proportion of unstained cells rose from 29. 2 +/- 9. 2 to 69. 0 +/- 10. 1 %. Electron microscopy demonstrated that VLA- 6 integrin was exclusively located on the sperm membrane of intact spermatozoa. Confocal analysis showed that laminin triggers distinct Ca 2 + raises, and that sperm exposed and kept in the presence of laminin fully retained their ability to rise intracellular Ca 2 + in response to zona pellucida proteins. These data indicate that boar sperm accumulate VLA- 6 integrin on the membrane and concentrate it on the acrosomal region as capacitation progresses. Probably due to this compartmentalisation, sperm exposed to laminin experience a Ca 2 + raise that originates in the anterior sperm head where it is more adequate for the induction of acrosome reaction.

40|$|The aim of optimalization the {{insemination}} doses {{production is}} to provide the highest fertilization ability of spermatozoa during the demanding proces of processing fresh semen and its subsequent cryopreservation. Temperature changes causes spermatozoa damage during the cooling and freezing. Spermatozoa is exposed to cold shock and many others limiting factors, which leads to cell death and therefore to decline of fertilization ability of thawed insemination doses. For increasing spermatozoa resistance, exactly the plasma membrane resistance against cold shock was fraction of egg yolk LDL cholesterol (low density lipoprotein) at various concentrations into the comercially produced diluents added. It is believed that LDL acts possitively to plasma membrane and helps to maintain the fertilization ability of spermatozoa after thawing. Following step in the proces of insemination doses production is slow cooling of diluted semen and equilibration, when the straws are store at cooling box for 30 minutes to 240 hours. This period is necessary to penetrate of certain diluent components into the <b>spermatazoa</b> also maintain the balance between their intracellular and extracellular concentration. Also important is subsequent freezing temperature gradient of insemination doses. The most suitable freezing method is based on computer controlled temperature decline in freezing chamber which allows the precise control of ice crystals formation that could tear and kill the cell. During 2012 to 2016 was repeatedly collected semen from the group of breeding bulls (n = 27, Holstein and Czech Fleckvieh breed) at AI centre. Semen which fulfill the standard entrance conditions in first step was evenly into several parts divided. For dilution {{the three types of}} comercially diluents AndroMed, Bioxcell and Triladyl with and without LDL addition were used. Into the diluents AndroMed and Bioxcell the concentration of LDL 4 %, 6 % and 8 % into the dilent Triladyl 6 %, 8 % and 10 % was added. Diluted semen was filled into the glass capillares with volume 0, 1 ml and temperature + 4 °C. Subsequently the sample was placed to cold bath (0 °C) for 10 minutes. Then the volume of capillare with physiological solution (37 °C) was mixed and for next 120 minutes was incubate. The effect of cold shock to proportion of live spermatozoa was evaluated by using Eosin and Nigrosine staining technique during heat test of spermatozoa survivability after spermatozoa heating and after 120 minutes of incubation. The more suitable semen diluents which provide the higher spermatozoa resistance against cold shock were AndroMed and Bioxcell. Together the possitive effect of LDL addition into the diluents to lower decrease of proportion of live spermatozoa during heat test was found (P< 0. 05). The most suitable LDL concentration which had a favorable influence at spermatozoa resistance against cold shock was 6 % in diluent Bioxcell. Values of the proportion of live sperm were higher {{at the beginning of the}} heat test (+ 1. 31 % to + 3. 2 %) and after 120 minute incubation (+ 5. 82 % to + 8. 41 %) compared to other diluents with and without addition of LDL. In the next step the process of equilibration was optimized, is an important part of insemination doses production. The effect of the length of equilibration for subsequent fertilization ability of spermatozoa was evaluated using spermatozoa motility based of CASA and proportion of live spermatozoa after thawing and during heat survival test lasting 120 minutes (37 ° C). Suitable semen was diluted by comercially used diluent AndroMed based on soya lecithin, filled into the straws (0. 25 ml), cooled and equilibrated in cooling box for 30, 120 and 240 minutes and freezed in programmable freezing box applying four types of freezing curves differing in temperature rate decline. There was used standard and by producer recommended 3. phase freezing curve, then 2. phase freezing curve, and 3. phase freezing curve with slower as well as rapid decline of temperature rate in freezing chamber, compared with standard freezing curve. The highest spermatozoa motility was found using 240 minutes of equilibration by + 2. 72 % and + 4. 58 % compared to other lengths of equilibration (P < 0. 05 to 0. 01). The highest proportion of live spermatozoa was found using 120 minutes of equilibration (+ 6. 87 % and + 8. 68 %). The highest average spermatozoa motility during heat test after thawing was achieved by using 2. phase freezing curve (from + 2. 97 % to + 10. 37 %, P < 0. 05), also in the proportion of live spermatozoa (from + 4. 37 % to + 8. 82 %, P < 0. 01). When evaluating interaction between the length of equilibration and freezing curve (standard 3. phase and 2. phase freezing curve), the highest average spermatozoa motility and proportion of live spermatozoa using 240 minutes of equilibration by both freezing curves was reached, there was no statistically significant differences. As well as, in all evaluated parts of this study the individual differences between ejaculate of bulls and within semen from one bull (P < 0. 05) as secondary effect were found. To maintain good fertilization ability of semen during cryopreservation is necessary to increase the spermatozoa resistance against cold shock using addition of correct concentration of LDL into the commercially used diluents AndroMed and Bioxcell. Subsequently the fertilization ability of insemination dose is influenced by cooling, the length of equilibration and freezing. The length of equilibration 120 minutes and more as well as gentle way of freezing according to freezing curve, which ensures a gradual decrease of temperature in freezing chamber provided the higher average spermatozoa motility and proportion of live spermatozoa...|$|R
