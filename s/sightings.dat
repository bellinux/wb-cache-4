5|$|Historically, the hookbill {{was only}} {{recorded}} three times. All three <b>sightings</b> {{were made by}} George C. Munro; the first was when he collected a single bird on February 22, 1913, {{and the other two}} <b>sightings</b> came on March 16, 1916 and August 12, 1918. The only existing specimen is in the Bernice P. Bishop Museum in Honolulu. The species was not recorded by the native Hawaiians.|$|E
5|$|Whales again {{migrate off}} Japanese archipelagos {{and into the}} Sea of Japan. Connections between these stocks and whales seen in the Sea of Okhotsk, on Kamchatka coasts and around the Commander Islands have been studied. Historical {{wintering}} distributions could have been much wider and more southerly distributed, as whales were seen in areas along the Batanes, Sulu and Celebes Seas including off Palawan, Luzon, Malaysia and Mindanao, with higher densities around today's Cape Eluanbi and Kenting National Park. Unconfirmed <b>sightings</b> have been reported near Borneo in modern times. The first confirmation in modern Taiwan was of a pair off Hualien in 1994, followed by a successful escape from entanglement off Taitung in 1999, and continuous <b>sightings</b> around Orchid Island in 2000. Few/none regularly migrate into Kenting National Park. In addition, despite <b>sightings</b> reported almost annually off Green and Orchid Islands, relatively short stays in these waters indicate recoveries as winter foraging has not occurred. <b>Sightings,</b> including of a cow-calf pair, have occurred along {{the east coast of}} Taiwan. Around Hong Kong, two documented <b>sightings</b> were recorded in 2009 and in 2016. One of the first documented <b>sightings</b> within the Yellow Sea was of a group of 3 or 4 individuals, including a cow/calf pair in Changhai County in October, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{all of the}} 400 North Atlantic {{right whales}} live in the western North Atlantic Ocean. In {{northern}} spring, summer and autumn, they feed in areas off the Canadian and northeast U.S. coasts in a range stretching from New York to Newfoundland. Particularly popular feeding areas are the Bay of Fundy and Cape Cod Bay. In winter, they head south towards Georgia and Florida to give birth. There have been a smattering of <b>sightings</b> further east {{over the past few}} decades; several <b>sightings</b> were made close to Iceland in 2003. These are possibly the remains of a virtually extinct eastern Atlantic stock, but examination of old whalers' records suggests {{they are more likely to}} be strays. However, a few <b>sightings</b> are regular between Norway, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, the Canary Islands and even Italy and Sicily; at least the Norway individuals come from the Western stock.|$|E
5|$|Among Northern Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal, such as along Sri Lanka, India, and Malaysia, <b>sightings</b> {{and older}} records of fin whales exist.|$|E
5|$|Birchin Bower was {{eventually}} demolished {{to make way}} for a Ferranti factory, but <b>sightings</b> of the apparition were still reported.|$|E
5|$|In Washington, sea otters {{are found}} almost {{exclusively}} on the outer coasts. They can swim as close as six feet off shore along the Olympic coast. Reported <b>sightings</b> of sea otters in the San Juan Islands and Puget Sound almost always {{turn out to be}} North American river otters, which are commonly seen along the seashore. However, biologists have confirmed isolated <b>sightings</b> of sea otters in these areas since the mid-1990s.|$|E
5|$|Otters were {{observed}} twice in Southern California in 2011, once near Laguna Beach and once at Zuniga Point Jetty, near San Diego. These {{are the first}} documented <b>sightings</b> of otters this far south in 30 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{legend has}} now been largely forgotten, {{and there have been}} no {{reported}} <b>sightings</b> of the ghost in recent times.|$|E
5|$|Fin {{whales are}} {{regularly}} encountered on whale-watching excursions worldwide. In the Southern California Bight, fin whales are encountered year-round, {{with the best}} <b>sightings</b> between November and March. They can even be seen from land (for example, from Point Vicente, Palos Verdes, {{where they can be}} seen lunge feeding at the surface only a half mile to a few miles offshore). They are regularly sighted in the summer and fall in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Gulf of Maine, the Bay of Fundy, the Bay of Biscay, Strait of Gibraltar, the Mediterranean. In southern Ireland, they are seen inshore from June to February, with peak <b>sightings</b> in November and December. Cruise ships en route to and from the Antarctic Peninsula sometimes encounter fin whales in the Drake Passage.|$|E
5|$|Folklorist Campbell of Islay has {{speculated that}} {{descriptions}} of the boobrie may be based on <b>sightings</b> of the great auk. The bellowing sound made by the boobrie, more like a bull than a bird, may have its origin in the strange call of the common bittern, which was a rare visitor to Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, pygmy {{blue and}} Antarctic blue whales have been {{observed}} from various tours in almost all the coastlines of the continent. Among these, tours with <b>sightings</b> likely the highest rate are on west coast such as in Geographe Bay and in southern bight off Portland. For later, special tours to observe pygmy blues by helicopters are organized.|$|E
5|$|In his Natural History 9.4.9-11, Pliny the Elder {{describes}} numerous <b>sightings</b> of mermaids off {{the coast}} of Gaul, noting that their bodies were covered all over in scales and that their corpses frequently washed up on shore. He comments that the governor of Gaul even wrote a letter to Emperor Augustus to inform him.|$|E
5|$|In the North Atlantic, two {{stocks of}} B. m. musculus are recognised. The first is found off Greenland, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. This group is {{estimated}} to total about 500. The second, more easterly group is spotted from the Azores in spring to Iceland in July and August; it is presumed the whales follow the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between the two volcanic islands. Beyond Iceland, blue whales have been spotted {{as far north as}} Spitsbergen and Jan Mayen, though such <b>sightings</b> are rare. Scientists do not know where these whales spend their winters. The total North Atlantic population {{is estimated to}} be between 600 and 1,500. Off Ireland, the first confirmed <b>sightings</b> were made in 2008, since then Porcupine Seabight has been regarded as a prominent habitat for the species along with fin whales. One was sighted along Galicia, Spain, in 2017.|$|E
5|$|Many escapees from captivity {{can also}} be found in similar watery {{habitats}} around the world. <b>Sightings</b> are fairly common in Florida, although a breeding population has not yet been confirmed. In 2011, one specimen was spotted in the Central Coast of California.|$|E
5|$|Modern <b>sightings</b> {{around the}} Commander Islands have been annual {{but not in}} great numbers, and whales likely to migrate through the areas rather than summering, and {{possible}} mixing of western and eastern populations are expected to occur in this waters.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{mentions}} of fishers in literature occurred in The Audubon Book of True Nature Stories. Robert Snyder relates a tale of his encounter with fishers in the woods of the Adirondack Mountains of New York. He recounts three <b>sightings,</b> including one where he witnessed a fisher attacking a porcupine.|$|E
5|$|Since his death, {{there have}} been {{numerous}} alleged <b>sightings</b> of Presley. A long-standing conspiracy theory among some fans is that he faked his death. Fans have noted alleged discrepancies in the death certificate, reports of a wax dummy in his original coffin and numerous accounts of Presley planning a diversion so he could retire in peace.|$|E
5|$|Sixty-one {{species of}} mammals have been {{recorded}} in Grand Teton National Park. This includes the gray wolf, which had been extirpated from the region by the early 1900s but migrated into the Grand Teton National Park from adjacent Yellowstone National Park after the species had been reintroduced there. The re-establishment of the wolves has ensured that every indigenous mammal species now exists in the park. In addition to gray wolves, another 17 species of carnivores reside within Grand Teton National Park including grizzlies and the more commonly seen American black bear. Relatively common <b>sightings</b> of coyote, river otter, marten and badger and occasional <b>sightings</b> of cougar, Canadian lynx and wolverine are reported annually. A number of rodent species exist including yellow-bellied marmot, least chipmunk, muskrat, beaver, Uinta ground squirrel, pika, snowshoe hare, porcupine, and six species of bats.|$|E
5|$|The British Birds Rarities Committee (BBRC), {{established}} in 1959, {{is the national}} bird rarities committee for Britain. It assesses claimed <b>sightings</b> of bird species that are rarely seen in Britain, based on descriptions, photographs and video recordings submitted by observers. Its findings are published in an annual report in the journal British Birds.|$|E
5|$|The finless {{porpoise}} {{is known to}} also follow seasonal migrations. It is known that populations {{in the mouth of}} the Indus River migrate to the sea from April through October to feed on the annual spawning of prawns. In Japan, <b>sightings</b> of small pods of them herding sand lance onto shore are common year-round.|$|E
5|$|The more marine species, such as petrels, auks and gannets, {{are more}} {{restricted}} in their habits, but are occasionally seen inland as vagrants. This most commonly happens to young inexperienced birds, but {{can happen in}} great numbers to exhausted adults after large storms, an event known as a wreck, where they provide prized <b>sightings</b> for birders.|$|E
5|$|The {{turquoise}} parrot {{is found}} {{in the foothills of the}} Great Dividing Range and surrounding areas. The northern limit of its range is 26° south in southeastern Queensland, around Cooloola, Blackbutt and Chinchilla, extending westwards to the vicinity of St George. Before 1945, it had been recorded as far north as the Suttor River and Mackay. In New South Wales, it {{is found in}} a broad band across the central and eastern parts of the state, with its western limits delineated by Moree, Quambone, Hillston, Narrandera and Deniliquin. There have been unconfirmed <b>sightings</b> in the far west of the state. In Victoria it {{is found in the}} vicinity of Wangaratta as well as East Gippsland and around Mallacoota. <b>Sightings</b> in South Australia are likely to have been the scarlet-chested parrot, the similar appearance of the females leading to confusion and misidentification.|$|E
5|$|Within Britain, {{there has}} been {{continuing}} interest in Lucan's fate. Since Rivett's murder, hundreds of reported <b>sightings</b> {{have been made in}} various countries around the world; none have been substantiated. Despite a police investigation and huge press interest, Lucan has not been found and is presumed dead; a death certificate was issued in 2016.|$|E
5|$|Woodland caribou once {{inhabited}} the region but have disappeared due to predation by wolves, encroachment by deer, {{and the effects}} of a brainworm parasite carried by deer which is harmful to both caribou and moose populations. Very rare <b>sightings</b> have been reported in nearby areas.|$|E
5|$|A {{small ship}} travels to a {{rotating}} space station. Aboard the station, {{a group of}} starfish-like beings discuss how to warn humans of an impending disaster, deciding on contacting Japanese scientist Dr. Kumara. Meanwhile, flying saucers are spotted over the skies of Tokyo, baffling scientists. A journalist tries to get a statement from Dr. Kumara about the <b>sightings,</b> but Kumara replies {{that there is not}} enough evidence to formulate a hypothesis. At an observatory, Professor Isobe spots an object in his telescope apparently releasing smaller objects.|$|E
5|$|A.× cunninghamii (Albany Woollybush), {{a hybrid}} between A.cuneatus and A.sericeus, was first {{collected}} in 1827, and published as A.cunninghamii in 1845. Other than some dubious collections in the 1830s and 1840s, no further <b>sightings</b> {{are known to}} have been made until 1973, when Nelson rediscovered it. At the time it was regarded as a distinct species, but by 1995 it was thought to be a hybrid, and this was confirmed by genetic analysis in 2002. In appearance it is very similar to A.sericeus, but its leaf segments are flat rather than cylindrical.|$|E
5|$|Added in 1983, Jumpin' Jungle is an {{interactive}} play area for {{both children and}} adults. The area includes many attractions such as a ball pit, slides, climbing nets, and a suspension bridge. Added in 2008, Bigfoot's Mudslide gets its name from Westmoreland County's reputation for the most <b>sightings</b> in Pennsylvania of Bigfoot, an alleged ape-like creature said to inhabit remote forests.|$|E
5|$|After several <b>sightings,</b> the Fringe team {{move into}} some nearby storm drains to bait the chimera with its larvae. Feeling {{somewhat}} responsible, Walter locks himself {{in with the}} chimera and ingests some poison that will kill him within the hour, believing that if it kills him, the chimera will only be killing itself. He manages to shoot the chimera in time however, and they use its blood {{to find a cure}} for Charlie.|$|E
5|$|An astronomical text {{recovered}} from Tomb no.3 in Mawangdui contains images {{and descriptions of}} 29 different comets. The descriptions often include the comet's name, notes about its apparition, and its associated portent, usually military, but lack detailed dates of the comets' <b>sightings.</b> This text can be solidly dated as being prior to 168 BC, the date assigned to the tomb. It {{may be associated with}} a similar astronomical text from the same tomb, which details planetary motions for the seventy years ending 177 BC.|$|E
5|$|As Mikawa's force {{neared the}} Guadalcanal area, the Japanese ships {{launched}} three floatplanes for one final reconnaissance of the Allied ships, {{and to provide}} illumination by dropping flares during the upcoming battle. Although several of the Allied ships heard and/or observed {{one or more of}} these floatplanes, starting at 23:45 on August 8, none of them interpreted the presence of unknown aircraft in the area as an actionable threat, and no one reported the <b>sightings</b> to Crutchley or Turner.|$|E
5|$|As the One Point Five fleet {{enters the}} Solar System, the Nine Limbeds orbit and observe Earth in cigar-shaped craft, {{sparking}} numerous UFO <b>sightings.</b> A Grand Galactic member, {{who happens to}} be passing by, stops to observe the effects of Silent Thunder and returns to the Grand Galactic collective, who immediately suspend the One Point Fives's destruct orders pending further investigation.|$|E
5|$|Because the minelayers were {{operating}} {{within range of}} German surface raiders, the American battleships were detailed to provide an escort for them, along with other units of the Grand Fleet. For the most part, these expeditions proved uneventful, but on two occasions, on 30 June and again on 8 August, lookouts on the battleships reported seeing U-boats or torpedoes in the water, forcing the Division to maneuver accordingly. Like the previous <b>sightings</b> made while escorting the Scandinavian Convoy, subsequent review of German war records revealed that both cases were false alarms.|$|E
5|$|Before 1977, no {{expedition}} {{had been}} to Stewart Island/Rakiura {{to search for the}} bird. In 1977, <b>sightings</b> of kakapo were reported on Stewart Island. An expedition to the island found a track and bowl system on its first day; soon after, it located several dozen kakapo. The finding in an 8,000-hectare area of fire-modified scrubland and forest raised hope that the population would include females. The total population was estimated at 100 to 200 birds.|$|E
5|$|Despite many <b>sightings</b> and a {{seemingly}} large and diverse distribution, wood turtle numbers are in decline. A {{large number of}} deaths caused by humans result from: habitat destruction, farming accidents, and road traffic. Also, it is commonly collected illegally for the international pet trade. These combined threats have caused many areas where they live to enact laws protecting it. Despite legislation, enforcement of the laws and education of the public regarding the species are minimal.|$|E
5|$|During {{the chaotic}} {{days after the}} war, {{contradictory}} reports arose as to Bormann's whereabouts. <b>Sightings</b> were reported in Argentina, Spain, and elsewhere. Bormann's wife was placed under surveillance in case he tried to contact her. Jakob Glas, Bormann's long-time chauffeur, insisted that he saw Bormann in Munich in July 1946. In case Bormann was still alive, multiple public notices about the upcoming Nuremberg trials were placed in newspapers and on the radio in October and November 1945 to notify him of the proceedings against him.|$|E
5|$|Farthest South was {{the most}} southerly latitudes reached by explorers before the conquest of the South Pole in 1911. Significant steps {{on the road to}} the pole were the {{discovery}} of lands south of Cape Horn in 1619, Captain James Cook's crossing of the Antarctic Circle in 1773, and the earliest confirmed <b>sightings</b> of the Antarctic mainland in 1820. From the late 19th century onward, the quest for Farthest South latitudes became in effect a race to reach the pole, which culminated in Roald Amundsen's success in December 1911.|$|E
