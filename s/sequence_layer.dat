40|$|The main {{processes}} invoked {{to explain}} the demise of Homo neanderthalensis are the effects of adverse climatic conditions in the northern hemisphere during Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3) and {{the outcome of the}} interaction with Anatomically Modern Humans (AMHs). Evidence for the co-existence of these two hominins, however, is elusive and, therefore, verifying the role which these processes might have played in the extirpation of Neandertals remains a topic of heated debate. A site which can contribute to throw light on the replacement of H. neanderthalensis by AMHs is Riparo Mezzena, a rockshelter in northern Italy, where late Mousterian lithic industries were found in association with human remains. This paper reviews the results of recent investigations on the lithic assemblages and human bones recovered during excavation campaigns which took place in 1957 and 1977. The study of the physical anthropology of the skeletal remains, in conjunction with palaeogenetic analyses on mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, have proven that the occupiers of Riparo Mezzena were Neandertals. The first radiocarbon date for the site, obtained on collagen extracted from a bovid from the lowermost part of the stratigraphic <b>sequence</b> (<b>Layer</b> III) and presented here (34, 540 +/- 655 C- 14 uncal BP), attests that Riparo Mezzena was occupied during the Middle-to-Upper Palaeolithic transition period. The anthropogenic deposits at the site actually accumulated when the nearby site of Grotta di Fumane was occupied by humans who produced Proto-Aurignacian lithic industries. This suggests that Neandertals and AMHs probably co-existed {{for a short period of}} time in northern Italy, possibly competing for resources within the confined territory of the Monti Lessini. These findings arising from new research on the collections of Riparo Mezzena have important implications not only for the study of the Middle-to-Upper Palaeolithic transition in Italy, but also for the understanding of the process through which AMHs replaced H. neanderthalensis...|$|E

Pentlandite, nickel-iron and barrel-shaped olivine crystals, minerals typical of the matrix of Allende and found nowhere else in HAL, are found in layer V and increase in abundance toward its exterior, as if grains of these phases accreted together with the other minerals of layer V. This layer also contains alternating olivine-rich and garnet-, pyroxene-rich bands, resembling rhythmic layering. For these reasons, we conclude that each of the layers of the friable rim formed by the accretion of an assemblage of condensate grains rather than by complete reaction of a precursor to HAL with a nebular gas. Thus, the unusual isotopic characteristics of HAL are thought to have been inherited from a nebular reservoir which was isotopically distinct from that which gave rise to the bulk of the material in Allende. HAL's mineralogical peculiarities indicate that its formation reservoir was also chemically distinct from the latter one...|$|E

40|$|Located in {{southwest}} France, Roc de Marsal is a cave {{with a rich}} Mousterian stratigraphic sequence. The {{lower part of the}} <b>sequence</b> (<b>Layers</b> 9 – 5) are characterized by assemblages dominated by Levallois lithic technology associated with composite faunal spectra (including red deer, roe deer and reindeer) that shows a gradual increase in the frequency of reindeer. The top of the <b>sequence</b> (<b>Layers</b> 4 – 2) are characterised instead by Quina lithic technology (both in terms of technology and typology) with the faunal remains dominated by reindeer. Roc de Marsal thus provides a very interesting case study to place behavioural changes in a context of changing climates and environments in western Europe during the late Pleistocene. To link the occupations at Roc de Marsal with global and regional climatic conditions known independently, a robust chronology is needed. With this aim in mind, we applied three luminescence dating methods (TL, OSL and IRSL) on different minerals (flint, quartz and K-feldspar extracts). Here the results of two of these methods are presented in detail (TL and OSL) and compared with preliminary IRSL data. At Roc de Marsal, a comparison of methods was necessary to overcome a complex sedimentary history, with very heterogeneous dose rate distributions, both at the beta (mm) and gamma (dm) dose rate scales. The results indicate that the lower Levallois layers are dated to ∼ 65 – 70 ka, while overlying Quina layers are dated to ∼ 49 ka. These ages for the lower layers fit well with some models that place mixed faunal assemblages in the initial MIS 4; however, while the Quina ages overlap with several other Quina assemblages from the region, they place the reindeer dominated fauna well after the peak cold of MIS 4 and suggest a more extended and complex period of contemporaneous lithic techno-complexes than posited by some current models...|$|R

40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to the University Research Degree Committee in fulfillment ofthe requirements for the degree of DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY in RoboticsThis thesis addresses {{the problem of how}} to control an autonomous mobile robot navigation in indoor environments, in the face of sensor noise, imprecise information, uncertainty and limited response time. The thesis argues that the effective control of autonomous mobile robots can be achieved by organising low level and higher level control activities into a layered architecture. The low level reactive control allows the robot to respond to contingencies quickly. The higher level control allows the robot to make longer term decisions and arranges appropriate sequences for a task execution. The thesis describes the design and implementation of a two layer control architecture, a task template based <b>sequencing</b> <b>layer</b> and a fuzzy behaviour based low level control <b>layer.</b> The <b>sequencing</b> <b>layer</b> works at the pace of the higher level of abstraction, interprets a task plan, mediates and monitors the controlling activities. While the low level performs fast computation in response to dynamic changes in the real world and carries out robust control under uncertainty. The organisation and fusion of fuzzy behaviours are described extensively for the construction of a low level control system. A learning methodology is also developed to systematically learn fuzzy behaviours and the behaviour selection network and therefore solve the difficulties in configuring the low level control layer. A two layer control system has been implemented and used to control a simulated mobile robot performing two tasks in simulated indoor environments. The effectiveness of the layered control and learning methodology is demonstrated through the traces of controlling activities at the two different levels. The results also show a general design methodology that the high level should be used to guide the robot's actions while the low level takes care of detailed control in the face of sensor noise and environment uncertainty in real time...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{habitability}} {{of ancient}} Mars {{is a key}} goal in the exploration of that planet. Evidence for conditions favorable to early life must be sought in ancient sedimentary rocks, {{such as those of}} Arabia Terra and Meridiani Planum. Arabia Terra, the northernmost extension of the ancient highlands, is dominated by cratered plains and minor ridged units. These plains extend south into the adjacent Meridiani Planum. The Opportunity rover landed in northern Meridiani, close to the border with Arabia. High resolution MOC images reveal extensive <b>layered</b> <b>sequences</b> across much of the Arabia and Meridiani region. These layers have been interpreted as eroded remnants of sedimentary rock deposits (Edgett, 2005). The <b>layered</b> <b>sequences</b> are concentrated in the SW quadrant of Arabia and in northern Meridiani. Preliminary mapping by Edgett (2005) distinguished four large scale <b>layered</b> <b>sequences</b> in the Arabia and Meridiani region. These have dimensions of hundreds to more than 1, 000 km. MOLA altimetry shows that each of the sequences can attain a thickness of 200 to 400 m, with a total thickness greater than 1 km. The sequences are generally flat lying, with regional slopes of a few degrees. Much finer layering is evident within a number of craters. The plains and ridged units of the Arabia and Meridiani region were originally mapped as Noachian based on crater statistics, particularly the number of large craters (Scott and Carr, 1978). The <b>layered</b> <b>sequences</b> in the current study postdate many, but not all, of these large craters. The <b>layered</b> <b>sequences</b> have partially or totally filled a number of craters with diameters ranging from 20 to over 50 km. The topmost <b>layered</b> <b>sequence,</b> as well as the lower two sequences, have intermediate thermal inertia, as derived from THEMIS, indicative of moderate induration. The TES spectra from the lower sequences include features indicative of basalt. Some areas of the topmost sequence, which includes the Opportunity landing site, have TES spectra dominated by hematite. Just below this topmost sequence lies a sequence with higher thermal inertia, indicative of more indurated or coarser grained material. The TES spectra of this sequence lack distinctive mineral features, and the rocks may be obscured by a thin coating of dust. The layers have been extensively eroded. The uppermost sequences are characterized by deeply scalloped boundaries. Filled craters have been partially exhumed. Finely layered deposits within craters have been strongly dissected. Landforms uniquely attributable to wind erosion are rare, but erosive styles and geomorphology characteristic of water and possibly ice are present.
