5|$|Ralph Cipriano was The Philadelphia Inquirers {{religion}} {{reporter for}} about a year in 1993. During that time he was called several times by Tierney on behalf of Tierney's client, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia. After leaving the religion reporter position, Cipriano wrote articles for the Sunday paper, where in 1997 he wrote a profile on Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua. The profile turned into an investigative piece as Cipriano obtained documents detailing US$5 million in questionable spending and how the church was <b>spending</b> <b>millions</b> in the suburbs while cutting inner-city services.|$|E

In September 2012, Equatorial Guinea sued France in the International Criminal Court after French police raided a Paris mansion owned by Teodorin and found luxury goods worth millions of Euros. The complaint called on the ICC to prohibit France from interfering in its internal affairs and to order France to stop legal action against its representatives.|$|E

25|$|Oil, gas, {{and coal}} {{companies}} have been at odds with policy makers who have supported a wider implementation of renewable energy, with the former often <b>spending</b> <b>millions</b> of dollars to lobby against cleaner energy. The Washington Post reported on February 22, 2017 Scott Pruitt's potential special interests with the fossil fuel industry as he began his term as the appointed head of the EPA under the Trump administration. Fossil fuel emission disproportionately affects working class, poor and minority populations. The people most adversely affected also have the least political influence and least access to health care.|$|E
25|$|Korolev was {{keenly aware}} of the orbital {{possibilities}} of the rockets being designed as ICBMs. He conceptualized using the R-7 to launch Sputnik as early as 1953, and suggested to the Academy of Sciences of the USSR the concept for sending a dog into space. The Communist Party was uninterested until the United States press began discussing a possible satellite launch for the International Geophysical year. While the US government debated the idea of <b>spending</b> <b>millions</b> of dollars on this concept. Korolev's group suggested the international prestige of launching a satellite before the United States could act. The spirit of cold war competition was adequate to secure approval for the project.|$|E
25|$|The {{campaign}} {{was dominated by}} independent candidates, as the electorate completed the turn against the establishment parties begun in 1993. In the final poll {{of the year in}} December 1997 Irene Sáez, a former beauty queen (Miss Universe 1981) and mayor of the Caracas district of Chacao, reached almost 70% as an independent candidate. However, despite <b>spending</b> <b>millions</b> of dollars on publicity, she fell below 15% within six months, as the public became increasingly sceptical of her readiness for the Presidency, and as she lost credibility as an anti-establishment candidate after accepting the endorsement of COPEI. The other early leading candidate, the former Democratic Action leader Claudio Fermín, reached 35% in December 1997, but fell to 6% by April 1998.|$|E

25|$|There was {{excitement}} that The Philadelphia Inquirer and the Philadelphia Daily News {{would be under}} local ownership {{for the first time}} since Walter Annenberg sold the paper to Knight Newspapers in 1969. The buyout was met with skepticism, however, among the employees at The Inquirer, who feared the new owners might threaten the editorial independence of the newspaper. Concerns were especially directed to Brian Tierney, who in the past had criticized Inquirer reporters for doing negative stories about his clients during his time at Tierney Communications. Tierney allayed fears by having the members of Philadelphia Media Holdings sign a pledge not to interfere with the paper's editorial independence. Tierney said he would combat The Inquirers decreasing revenue and circulation by <b>spending</b> <b>millions</b> on advertisements and promotions and not by laying off staff.|$|E
500|$|For {{the last}} two years of his life, Hubbard lived in a luxury Blue Bird {{motorhome}} on Whispering Winds, a 160-acre ranch near Creston, California. He remained in deep hiding while controversy raged in the outside world about whether he was still alive and if so, where. He spent his time [...] "writing and researching", according to a spokesperson, and pursued photography and music, overseeing construction work and checking on his animals. He repeatedly redesigned the property, <b>spending</b> <b>millions</b> of dollars remodeling the ranch house—which went virtually uninhabited—and building a quarter-mile horse-racing track with an observation tower, which reportedly was never used.|$|E

She said the U.S. was also <b>spending</b> <b>millions</b> of dollars to aid Pakistan's capacity building through renovation and repair of the Tarbela dam and others that would add over 500MW to the national grid. [...] "There is no short-term solution to end the gap between electricity consumption and generation, which was currently around 5,000MW," [...] she said, adding that things would better during {{the years to come}} should Pakistan start work on power generation projects. Dismissing the notion that the U.S. was only giving all this assistance to change public perception in Pakistan as inaccurate, she stated that [...] "The US wants to help Pakistan meet its energy needs. The process of assistance was started years ago on public request. Before that the US had been providing only military assistance to Pakistan." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2005 Tierney {{attempted}} to buy magazines Inc. and Fast Company from Gruner + Jahr, but failed. [...] Tierney tried again {{to enter the}} media industry in March 2006 when he assembled a group of mostly former clients or people that are {{with him on the}} board of the Episcopal Academy to buy Philadelphia Newspapers Inc. He and other local businessman formed Philadelphia Media Holdings LLC and bought The Philadelphia Inquirer, Philadelphia Daily News and philly.com for US$515 million from The McClatchy Company which was selling off newspapers in unionized and low-growth markets after buying Philadelphia Newspapers Inc.'s parent company Knight Ridder. The buyout was met with skepticism by many at The Inquirer, especially by reporters who had been contacted in the past by Tierney on behalf of his clients. Tierney allayed fears with the members of Philadelphia Media Holdings signing a pledge not to interfere with the paper's editorial independence. Tierney said he would combat The Inquirers decreasing revenue by <b>spending</b> <b>millions</b> on advertisements and promotions and not by laying off staff. Tierney assumed the role as publisher of The Philadelphia Inquirer in August 2006 after former publisher Joe Natoli resigned for a job at the University of Miami.|$|E

Not that I blame that. It is necessary. Yes! but the hideous thing is, that it should be necessary. Does that state of things look much like progress of the human race?

6000|$|... 124. Now, I {{have given}} you my message, containing, as I know, offence enough, and itself, it may seem to many, {{unnecessary}} enough. But just in proportion to its apparent non-necessity, and to its certain offence, was its real need, and my real duty to speak it. The study {{of the fine arts}} could not be rightly associated with the grave work of English Universities, without due and clear protest against the misdirection of national energy, which for the present renders all good results of such study on a great scale, impossible. I can easily teach you, as any other moderately good draughtsman could, how to hold your pencils, and how to lay your colours; but it is little use my doing that, while the nation is <b>spending</b> <b>millions</b> of money in the destruction of all that pencil or colour has to represent, and in the promotion of false forms of art, which are only the costliest and the least enjoyable of follies. And therefore {{these are the things that}} I have first and last to tell you in this place;--that the fine arts are not to be learned by Locomotion, but by making the homes we live in lovely, and by staying in them;--that the fine arts are not to be learned by Competition, but by doing our quiet best in our own way;--that the fine arts are not to be learned by Exhibition, but by doing what is right, and making what is honest, whether it be exhibited or not;--and, for the sum of all, that men must paint and build neither for pride nor for money, but for love; for love of their art, for love of their neighbour, and whatever better love may be than these, founded on these. I know that I gave some pain, which I was most unwilling to give, in speaking of the possible abuses of religious art; but there can be no danger of any, so long as we remember that God inhabits cottages as well as churches, and ought to be well lodged there also. Begin with wooden floors; the tessellated ones will take care of themselves; begin with thatching roofs, and you shall end by splendidly vaulting them; begin by taking care that no old eyes fail over their Bibles, nor young ones over their needles, for want of rushlight, and then you may have whatever true good is to be got out of coloured glass or wax candles. And in thus putting the arts to universal use, you will find also their universal inspiration, their universal benediction. I told you there was no evidence of a special Divineness in any application of them; that they were always equally human and equally Divine; and in closing this inaugural series of lectures, into which I have endeavoured to compress the principles that are to be the foundations of your future work, it is my last duty to say some positive words as to the Divinity of all art, when it is truly fair, or truly serviceable.|$|E
