40|$|Popular microblogging {{service has}} {{attracted}} much attention around the world recently. With tremendous amount of tweets published each day, <b>social</b> <b>event</b> detection is becom-ing {{one of the most}} challenging research topics, especially for geographical <b>social</b> <b>event.</b> This paper proposes a nov-el geographical <b>social</b> <b>event</b> detection approach by mining geographical temporal pattern and analyzing the content of tweets. For the tweets published by users in the geographical area at each time unit, we first estimate its geographical tem-poral pattern based on the alternation regularity of tweets. Furthermore, we discovery the unusual geographical area by more frequent alternation of tweet count, and adopt adap-tive K-means clustering algorithm for the tweets published in the geographical area. Finally, the geographical <b>social</b> <b>event</b> is detected by the number of the tweets in the cluster. We implement and validate our approach on realistic data collected from real-world social media websites. Experimen-tal results show that our method can detect geographical <b>social</b> <b>event</b> with better performance than traditional meth-ods. In addition, vivid demonstration of geographical <b>social</b> <b>event</b> can be effectively performed by our method...|$|R
