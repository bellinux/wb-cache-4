The case was struck from the roll of the Pietermaritzburg High Court, after the prosecution's application for a postponement (petitioned in order to allow the NPA to secure admissible forms of documentation required as evidence) was dismissed. In dismissing the application for postponement, the Court rendered moot the defence's application for a permanent <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> which would prevent Zuma from being criminally prosecuted.|$|E
25|$|On 11 May 1990, Magistrate Gurry ordered Einem {{to stand}} trial for the two murders of Alan Barnes and Mark Langley. Einem's defence counsel appealed the decision, {{launching}} an abuse of process action in the Supreme Court of South Australia to achieve a permanent <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings,</b> as well as stating that the huge media interest in the charges would result in their client not getting a fair trial. Proceedings began on 19 June 1990 before Justice Kevin Duggan, and six months later on 17 December 1990, Justice Duggan released his findings. He ordered Einem {{to stand trial}}, however he expressed concerns {{with most of the}} prosecution's evidence.|$|E

25|$|Zuma's {{legal team}} {{continued}} to delay proceedings {{and in spite}} of Zuma's claim that he desired the matter to appear in court, succeeded in making critical evidence unavailable to the court resulting in the prosecution making an application for postponement on the set date. As the prosecution was not ready the case was struck from the roll after the prosecution's application for a postponement was dismissed, however Zuma's legal team was unsuccessful in its attempts to have the courts grant a permanent <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> (which would have rendered Zuma immune to prosecution on the charges). This left Zuma open to being recharged with corruption as soon as the NPA completed preparing its case.|$|E

In his ruling, Judge Beaulieu of the Quebec Superior Court agreed with Singh’s position that: [...] "... the bail conditions imposed on May 2001 have restrained his right to freedom, opinion, expression and the right of freedom of association as protected by article 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Federal Court {{ruled on}} 11 February 2015 in Ishaq's favour. Judge Keith Boswell opined the {{regulations}} require citizenship judges administer the oath [...] "allowing the greatest possible {{freedom in the}} religious solemnization or the solemn affirmation thereof" [...] and asked how that could be possible if a rule requires candidates to [...] "violate or renounce a basic tenet of their religion". Prime Minister Stephen Harper reacted by stating the following day that the Crown-in-Council would appeal the judgement. However, the Federal Court of Appeal upheld the earlier ruling and refused an application for a <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings,</b> prompting the Conservative Party to, during the ongoing federal election (in which the niqāb matter became a 'wedge' issue) craft a press release indicating the Cabinet would introduce to parliament [...] "in the days ahead" [...] legislation to ban niqāb at citizenship ceremonies. Ishaq recited the oath privately before a female citizenship judge and became a Canadian citizen on 9 October 2015, though the government pressed the issue to the supreme court. Following the election won by the Liberal Party, the new Cabinet withdrew the challenge.|$|E

As it was late, he would ask leave to defer the examination of his three witnesses until the next morning.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} Gina Rinehart’s numerous attempts to suppress information and stay proceedings in the extraordinary litigation in the Rinehart family trust dispute. The Rinehart litigation, while only at its pre-trial stage, has delivered significant judgments {{on the new}} legislative powers to depart from the principle of open justice and the law relating to <b>stays</b> <b>of</b> <b>proceedings</b> (<b>stays</b> <b>of</b> a substantive claim and stays pending {{an appeal to the}} High Court). The new legislation is the Court Suppression and Non-publication Orders Act 2010 (NSW), which has national significance as it is the model statute that aims to be implemented in all Australian jurisdictions and is a Federal Bill. The Rinehart litigation proves that the principle of open justice continues to be fundamental under the model statute and that the media has an important role in ensuring its protection. Possible future questions under the statute could be about the meaning of ‘suppression’ and the operational differences in seeking review under the Federal and NSW model. The Rinehart litigation is significant as it has redefined the test for seeking a <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> orders pending <b>proceedings</b> in the High Court. It has also considered whether a claim can be stayed due to an agreement to use alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. Further, it signals that future legal developments may occur on the issue of whether trustee disputes are arbitrable. 19 page(s...|$|R

5000|$|However, the Court {{found it}} {{premature}} {{to rule on}} the preclusive effect of either Judge Robinson’s or Judge Whyte’s decisions, and that a <b>stay</b> <b>of</b> all <b>proceedings</b> would be appropriate.

The Federal Circuit’s resolution of Judge Robinson’s decision in Micron and Judge Whyte’s conflicting decision in Hynix I will be relevant - and potentially dispositive - to these proceedings.
