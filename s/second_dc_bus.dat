40|$|This paper proposes an {{simplified}} {{instantaneous output}} power control {{to suppress the}} <b>second</b> harmonic <b>DC</b> <b>bus</b> voltage due to asymmetry in a three-phase PWM converter system without any sequential component decomposers. Normally, in the instantaneous output power control, {{the positive and negative}} output voltages and currents are required and they are usually decomposed by notch filters or dual second-order generalized integrals that are difficult to tune and complicated. While in the proposed method, the positive-sequence and negative-sequence currents are regulated by PI plus resonant (PI-R) controllers in dq-frame. Therefore, the sequential current decomposers can be avoided. Meanwhile, the positive and negative sequence output voltages, which are essential for calculating the positive-sequence and negative-sequence current references, are simply obtained from the outputs of the PI and resonant controllers, respectively. The proposed method is robust to any asymmetries and its effectiveness is verified on a prototype asymmetric three-phase permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) system with inherent and externally added asymmetries...|$|R

40|$|AC-DC {{power factor}} {{correction}} (PFC) single-stage converters are attractive because of their cost and their simplicity. In these converters, both PFC and power conversion are done {{at the same time}} using a single converter that regulates the output. Since they have only a single controller, these converters operate with an intermediate transformer primary-side <b>DC</b> <b>bus</b> voltage that is unregulated and is dependent on the converters’ operating conditions and component values. This means that the <b>DC</b> <b>bus</b> voltage can vary significantly as line and load conditions are changed. Such a variable <b>DC</b> <b>bus</b> voltage makes it difficult to optimally design the converter transformer as well as the <b>DC</b> <b>bus</b> capacitor. One previously proposed single-stage AC-DC converter, the Single-Stage Buck-Boost Direct Energy Transfer (SSBBDET) converter has a clamping mechanism that can clamp the <b>DC</b> <b>bus</b> voltage to a pre-set limit. The clamping mechanism, however, superimposes a low frequency 120 Hz AC component on the output DC voltage so that some means must be taken to reduce this component. These means, however, make the converter transient slow and sluggish. The main objective of this thesis is to minimize the 120 Hz output ripple component and to improve the dynamic response of the SSBBDET converter by using a new control scheme. In the thesis, the operation of the SSBBDET converter is reviewed and the proposed control method is introduced and explained in detail.

40|$|AC coupled {{dual active}} bridge (DAB) dc-dc {{converters}} typically use phase shifted square wave (PSSW) modulation {{to manage the}} power flow between two dc sources. With this scheme, the current flowing between the converter bridges injects high-magnitude current harmonics into each dc port at multiples of the primary switching frequency, which can excite resonances in the LC circuits created by parasitic second-order impedances such as wiring inductances in the dc-link connections. This can cause substantial <b>dc</b> <b>bus</b> voltage and current oscillations, particularly with the higher switching frequencies that are used with wide bandgap devices, leading to excessive electromagnetic interference, significant filter stress, and eventual component operational failure. Conventionally, a relatively large <b>dc</b> <b>bus</b> filter capacitor (or inductor) helps to suppress these <b>dc</b> <b>bus</b> harmonic dynamics. However, the use of adaptive three-level modulation for a single phase DAB provides a much greater solution space to achieve a desired power transfer condition, with the three PSSW control angles that are available.
