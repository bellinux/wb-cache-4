5|$|On {{the night}} of 2–3 May, General Hasso von Manteuffel, {{commander}} of the III Panzer Army along with General Kurt von Tippelskirch, commander of <b>the</b> XXI Army, <b>surrendered</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> US Army. Von Saucken's II Army, that had been fighting north-east of Berlin in <b>the</b> Vistula Delta, <b>surrendered</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Soviets on 9 May.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{destruction}} of food crops, many civilians were forced to leave the hills and <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> TNI. Often, when surviving villagers came down to lower-lying regions to surrender, the military would execute them. Those who were not killed outright by TNI troops were sent to receiving centers for vetting, which had been prepared in advance in the vicinity of local TNI bases. In these transit camps, the surrendered civilians were registered and interrogated. Those who were suspected of being members of the resistance were killed.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the battle}} was over, Hitler {{and several of his}} {{followers}} killed themselves. The city's garrison surrendered on 2 May but fighting continued to the north-west, west, and south-west of the city {{until the end of the}} war in Europe on 8 May (9 May in the Soviet Union) as some German units fought westward so that they could <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Western Allies rather than to the Soviets.|$|E
5|$|By late October, the German {{forces were}} worn out, {{with only a}} third of their motor {{vehicles}} still functioning, infantry divisions at third- to half-strength, and serious logistics issues preventing the delivery of warm clothing and other winter equipment to the front. Even Hitler seemed to <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> idea of a long struggle, since the prospect of sending tanks into such a large city without heavy infantry support seemed risky after the costly capture of Warsaw in 1939.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about Kanhopatra. According to most {{traditional}} accounts, Kanhopatra was a courtesan and dancing-girl. These accounts typically concentrate on her death when she chose to <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Hindu god Vithoba—the patron god of the Varkaris—rather than becoming a concubine of the Badshah (king) of Bidar. She died in the central shrine of Vithoba in Pandharpur. She {{is the only person}} whose samadhi (mausoleum) is within the precincts of the temple.|$|E
5|$|Missouri {{was active}} in the Pacific Theatre of World War II, escorting the Fast Carrier Task Forces and {{shelling}} beachheads for Allied Army and Marine Corps personnel involved in amphibious operations against the Imperial Japanese forces. After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki the Empire of Japan capitulated to Allied demands, signing the instrument of <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> allied powers aboard Missouri on 2 September 1945.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{was being}} {{pressured}} to leave French soil by the interim French government in Paris. If he delayed, he risked becoming {{a prisoner of}} the Bourbons, Prussians or Austrians. The alternative was to <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British and request political asylum. On 10 July Napoleon sent two emissaries, General Anne Jean Marie René Savary and the Comte de Las Cases, out to Bellerophon to meet Maitland and discuss the possibility of allowing Napoleon {{to travel to the}} United States. Maitland was under orders to prevent this, and instead offered to take Napoleon on board his ship and transport him and his retinue to Britain. Further discussions and negotiations took place over the next few days, but with his options running out, Napoleon had decided by 13 July to <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> British. On 14 July Maitland was given a letter informing him that Napoleon would come out to Bellerophon the following morning to surrender.|$|E

5|$|Power had {{suffered}} from clinical depression since childhood and confided her fugitive status to her therapist Linda Carroll. She developed {{the desire to}} stop living her life under her assumed name and, through therapy that included participation in the mock trial of a soldier charged with killing civilians during the Vietnam War, she began to prepare for her <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> authorities. This included her decision to marry Duncan in 1992 and reveal her background to her friends.|$|E
5|$|The Underground State's {{military}} arm, Armia Krajowa, officially disbanded on 19 January 1945 {{to avoid}} armed {{conflict with the}} Soviets and a civil war. Over {{the next few years}} the communists solidified their hold on Poland, falsifying elections, persecuting the opposition and eliminating it as a political power. Remnants of the armed resistance (NIE, Armed Forces Delegation for Poland, Freedom and Independence) that refused to lay down their weapons and <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> communist regime continued to hold out for several years as the cursed soldiers, fighting the Soviet-backed communist forces until eradicated.|$|E
5|$|The {{survivors}} of Marsyas fell {{back to a}} sacred grove of Zeus at Labraunda and deliberated whether to <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Persians or to flee Asia altogether. However, while deliberating, {{they were joined by}} a Milesian army, and with these reinforcements resolved instead to carry on fighting. The Persians then attacked the army at Labraunda, and inflicted an even heavier defeat, with the Milesians suffering particularly bad casualties.|$|E

5|$|After Roger and Alexander's arrests Nigel {{defied the}} king. The bishops' castles refused to <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> king, {{therefore}} Stephen threatened to starve Alexander and Roger until they did. Sleaford and Newark surrendered and were given into {{the custody of}} Robert, the Earl of Leicester. Earl Robert also seized some of Lincoln's episcopal estates that had been disputed between the earl and the bishop. Alexander subsequently excommunicated Earl Robert when the earl refused to return the castle to Alexander's custody. Alexander then successfully applied to Pope Innocent II in 1139 for support {{in his efforts to}} recover Newark castle from Earl Robert.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of rest, the 20th Armoured Regiment {{returned}} {{to the front lines}} in early April. It made a series of advances against the retreating German rearguard. On 2 May, the regiment's A Company was the leading element of the 2nd New Zealand Division and entered Trieste. While most of the German garrison quickly surrendered, it was necessary to deal with some diehard elements who refused to surrender to either the New Zealanders or the Yugoslav partisans also present in the city. In fact, the partisans were reluctant to allow Germans to <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> New Zealanders at all.|$|E
5|$|After the Battle of Bad Axe, Black Hawk, Wabokieshiek, {{and their}} {{followers}} traveled northeast to seek refuge with the Ojibwes. American officials offered a reward of $100 and forty horses for Black Hawk's capture. While camping near present-day Tomah, Wisconsin, Black Hawk's party {{was seen by}} a passing Ho-Chunk man, who alerted his village chief. The village council sent a delegation to Black Hawk's camp and convinced him to <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Americans. On August 27, 1832, Black Hawk and Wabokieshiek surrendered at Prairie du Chien to Indian agent Joseph Street. Colonel Zachary Taylor took custody of the prisoners, and sent them by steamboat to Jefferson Barracks, escorted by Lieutenants Jefferson Davis and Robert Anderson.|$|E

5|$|After the Boss rescues Kinzie {{from her}} nightmare, she devises {{a plan to}} crash the simulation, which will force the Zin to draw power from their ship to keep it running, thus {{weakening}} the ship itself and creating an opening for the Saints to enter. Working together, the remaining Saints manage to overload the simulation, shutting it down just as the Boss escapes. Assaulting Zinyak's ship, the Boss finds power armor emulating the powers {{they had in the}} simulation, and confronts Zinyak in his throne room. While the entire Zin Empire watches, Zinyak and the Boss battle each other. With help from the Saints, the Boss kills Zinyak by tearing his head off and emerges victorious. Impressed, the Zin forces <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Boss, who becomes the new head of the Zin Empire.|$|E
5|$|At midday on 16 August, von Kluge {{had refused}} {{an order from}} Hitler for another counter-attack, and in the {{afternoon}} Hitler agreed to a withdrawal but became suspicious that von Kluge intended to <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Allies. Late on 17 August, Hitler sacked von Kluge and recalled him to Germany; von Kluge then either killed himself or was executed by SS-officer Jürgen Stroop for {{his involvement in the}} 20 July plot. Von Kluge was succeeded by Field Marshal Walter Model, whose first act was to order the immediate retreat of the 7th Army and Fifth Panzer Army, while the II SS Panzer Corps—with the remnants of four Panzer divisions—held the north face of the escape route against the British and Canadians, and the XLVII Panzer Corps—with what was left of two Panzer divisions—held the southern face against the Third US Army.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Italian <b>surrender</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Allies in September 1943, Premuda was still docked in Genoa, and was seized by Germany. Plans to convert her into a radar picket for night fighters were abandoned. In August 1944, {{following}} the replacement of her armament, she was commissioned into the German Navy as a Torpedoboot Ausland (foreign torpedo boat) with the designation TA32. The ship saw action shelling Allied positions on the Italian coast and laying naval mines. In March 1945, she took part in the Battle of the Ligurian Sea against two Royal Navy destroyers, during which she was lightly damaged. She was scuttled the following month as the Germans retreated from Genoa.|$|E
