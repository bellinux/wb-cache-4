5|$|A toddler who is {{securely}} {{attached to his}} or her parent (or other familiar caregiver) will explore freely while the caregiver is present, typically engages with strangers, is often visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and is generally happy to see the caregiver return. The extent of exploration and of distress are affected, however, by the child's temperamental make-up and by situational factors as well as by attachment status. A child's attachment is largely influenced by their primary caregiver's sensitivity to their needs. Parents who consistently (or almost always) respond to their child's needs will create {{securely attached}} children. <b>Such</b> <b>children</b> are certain that their parents will be responsive to their needs and communications.|$|E
5|$|Children who {{discontinue}} {{the diet}} after achieving seizure freedom {{have about a}} 20% risk of seizures returning. The length of time until recurrence is highly variable but averages two years. This risk of recurrence compares with 10% for resective surgery (where {{part of the brain}} is removed) and 30–50% for anticonvulsant therapy. Of those that have a recurrence, just over half can regain freedom from seizures either with anticonvulsants or by returning to the ketogenic diet. Recurrence is more likely if, despite seizure freedom, an electroencephalogram (EEG) shows epileptiform spikes, which indicate epileptic activity in the brain but are below the level that will cause a seizure. Recurrence is also likely if an MRI scan shows focal abnormalities (for example, as in children with tuberous sclerosis). <b>Such</b> <b>children</b> may remain on the diet longer than average, and {{it has been suggested that}} children with tuberous sclerosis who achieve seizure freedom could remain on the ketogenic diet indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|Some {{authors have}} {{proposed}} a broader continuum of definitions of attachment disorders ranging from RAD through various attachment difficulties to the more problematic attachment styles. There is as yet no consensus, on this issue but {{a new set of}} practice parameters containing three categories of attachment disorder has been proposed by C.H. Zeanah and N. Boris. The first of these is disorder of attachment, in which a young child has no preferred adult caregiver. The proposed category of disordered attachment is parallel to RAD in its inhibited and disinhibited forms, as defined in DSM and ICD. The second category is secure base distortion, where the child has a preferred familiar caregiver, but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment. <b>Such</b> <b>children</b> may endanger themselves, cling to the adult, be excessively compliant, or show role reversals in which they care for or punish the adult. The third type is disrupted attachment. Disrupted attachment is not covered under ICD-10 and DSM criteria, and results from an abrupt separation or loss of a familiar caregiver to whom attachment has developed. This form of categorisation may demonstrate more clinical accuracy overall than the current DSM-IV-TR classification, but further research is required. The practice parameters would also provide the framework for a diagnostic protocol. Most recently, Daniel Schechter and Erica Willheim have shown a relationship between some maternal violence-related posttraumatic stress disorder and secure base distortion (see above) which is characterized by child recklessness, separation anxiety, hypervigilance, and role-reversal.|$|E

5|$|The dragon was {{regarded}} as a great lover and seducer of beautiful women, whom he visited by night, entering their houses down the chimney before turning into a man. The women who were visited by a dragon would after a while grow weak, pale and sunken-faced. There were magical methods to repel the dragon from them. It was believed that the children born out of such liaisons were physically and mentally ill, and that they would not live long. In another belief, the dragon would come for his son amidst thunder and lightning, and fly away with him. In the region of Bitola, it was told that <b>such</b> <b>children</b> were born with a tail. After they grew wings, they flew into the sky, from where they shot witches with thunderbolts. There was a belief in the region of Leskovac that the dragon boys, fighters against ale born with the little wings, were offspring of dragons. At the village of Kruševo, Macedonia, people told of an old shepherd named Trail who was a son of a dragon. He was allegedly so strong that he could shatter cliffs, and when he shouted, his voice could be heard from miles away.|$|E
25|$|Interventions include {{supporting}} {{foster parents}} {{to learn to}} help the child in regulating emotions, to learn to respond effectively to the child's distress and to understand the child's signals, especially 'miscues' as the signals of <b>such</b> <b>children</b> are often confusing {{as a consequence of}} their often frightening, inconsistent and confusing past relationships. Foster carers are taught to recognize what <b>such</b> <b>children</b> actually need rather than what they may appear to signal that they need. <b>Such</b> <b>children</b> often exhibit provocative and oppositional behaviors which may normally trigger feelings of rejection in caregivers. Withdrawn children may be overlooked and seemingly independent, indiscriminate children may be considered to be managing much better than they are. Foster carers are regularly contacted and visited to assess their needs and progress.|$|E

25|$|Children can {{experience}} grief {{as a result}} of losses due to causes other than death. For example, children who have been physically, psychologically and/or sexually abused often grieve over the damage to, or loss of, their ability to trust.

25|$|Adopting older {{children}} presents other parenting issues. Some children from foster care have histories of maltreatment, such as {{physical and psychological}} neglect, physical abuse, and sexual abuse, and {{are at risk of}} developing psychiatric problems. <b>Such</b> <b>children</b> are at risk of developing a disorganized attachment. Studies by Cicchetti et al. (1990, 1995) found that 80% of abused and maltreated infants in their sample exhibited disorganized attachment styles.|$|E
25|$|The {{difficulties}} Sidis {{encountered in}} dealing with the social structure of a collegiate setting may have shaped opinion against allowing <b>such</b> <b>children</b> to rapidly advance through higher education in his day. Research indicates that a challenging curriculum can relieve social and emotional difficulties commonly experienced by gifted children. Embracing these findings, several colleges now have procedures for early entrance. The Davidson Institute for Talent Development has developed a guidebook on the topic.|$|E
25|$|A {{study done}} by Frankel et al. showed that parental {{intervention}} and instruction {{plays an important}} role in <b>such</b> <b>children</b> developing friendships. Along with parental intervention, school professionals play an important role in teaching social skills and peer interaction. Paraprofessionals, specifically one-on-one aides and classroom aides, are often placed with children with autism spectrum disorders in order to facilitate friendships and guide the child in making and maintaining substantial friendships.|$|E

25|$|Kindergarten {{has been}} shown to improve school {{readiness}} in children at risk. Children attending a kindergarten were less likely to have impaired speech or impaired motor development. Only 50% of children whose parents did not graduate from school are ready for school at age six. If <b>such</b> <b>children</b> were enrolled in a high-quality three-year Kindergarten programme, 87% were ready for school at age six. Thus Kindergarten helps to overcome unequal opportunities.|$|E
25|$|Foster {{parents may}} also present {{barriers}} to forming healthy attachment relationships. Based on Bowlby, the caregiving system {{is seen as}} a biobehavioral system in adults that is complementary to the child's attachment system. Not all foster carers have this strong biological disposition as many fear becoming too 'attached' and suffering loss, many are effectively doing it to earn money and some perceive <b>such</b> <b>children</b> as 'damaged goods' and may remain emotionally distant and under involved.|$|E
25|$|Children who {{are born}} preterm have {{difficulty}} in initiating breast feeds immediately after birth.

25|$|Although {{lessons and}} {{training}} may help peers {{of children with}} autism, bullying is still a major concern in social situations. According to Anahad O'Connor of The New York Times, bullying {{is most likely to}} occur against autistic children who have the most potential to live independently, such as those with Asperger syndrome. <b>Such</b> <b>children</b> are more at risk because they have as many of the rituals and lack of social skills as children with full autism, but {{they are more likely to}} be mainstreamed in school, since they are on the higher-functioning end of the autism spectrum. Children with autism have more difficulty attending to social cues, and so may not always recognize when they are being bullied.|$|E

Congressional Democrats and many Republicans tried to expand the coverage of the program to other needy families, but they were opposed by President George W. Bush and other Republicans. In 2006, 5.4 million children were eligible but not enrolled in SCHIP or Medicaid, and 9.4 million total children were uninsured. <b>Such</b> <b>children</b> and their families are often treated in emergency rooms of hospitals, a much more expensive alternative for taxpayers than expanding the SCHIP and similar programs.|$|E
