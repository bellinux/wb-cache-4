25|$|In most cassettes, the {{magnetic}} tape {{is attached to}} each spool with a leader, usually made of strong plastic. This leader protected the weaker magnetic tape from the shock occurring when the tape reached the end. Leaders can be complex: a plastic slide-in wedge anchors a short fully opaque plastic tape to the take-up hub; one or more tinted semi-opaque plastic segments follow; the clear leader (a tintless semi-opaque plastic segment) follows, which wraps almost {{all the way around}} the <b>supply</b> <b>reel,</b> before splicing to {{the magnetic}} tape itself. The clear leader spreads the shock load to a long stretch of tape instead of to the microscopic splice. Various patents have been issued detailing leader construction and associated tape player mechanisms to detect leaders. Cassette tape users would also use spare leaders to repair broken tapes.|$|E
5000|$|The tape {{is pulled}} from the <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> by a capstan and pinch roller, {{similar to those used}} in audio tape recorders.|$|E
50|$|Early VHS-C {{cassettes}} did {{not have}} a mechanism to ratchet or lock the <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> when not in use, making them susceptible to spilling tape inside the shell. Consequently, manufacturers placed a label on their camcorders and adapters to warn the user to check that the tape is not slackened before inserting a cassette. The user could dissipate the slack by manually turning the take-up gear. Later cassettes corrected this problem by adding teeth to the <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> to lock it in place when no upward pressure is applied. The spindle of the camcorder or VCR supplies pressure to float the reel's turntable and teeth above the shell, allowing it to rotate freely when in use.|$|E
50|$|WARQ {{signed on}} the air as WXRY on February 6, 1971 in mono with a Beautiful/Easy Listening music format. Later, the station {{converted}} to FM stereo, still with a Beautiful/Easy Listening music format <b>supplied</b> on <b>reel</b> to reel tape by Schulke.|$|R
5000|$|A plastic {{filament}} is <b>supplied</b> from a <b>reel,</b> either {{commercially available}} or home made, and fed into a heated liquefier {{where it is}} melted. This melt is then extruded by a nozzle while the incoming filament, still in solid phase, acts as a ‘‘plunger.’’ ...|$|R
5|$|Joseph Sachs {{had also}} invented an {{electric}} fire engine vehicle {{consisting of a}} wagon on which a spring-supported platform held an electric motor which operated two rotary water pumps. The motor was <b>supplied</b> with a <b>reel</b> of electric cable {{and it could be}} regulated from either side of the vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|Lennon {{dubbed the}} {{technique}} [...] "flanging" [...] after producer George Martin jokingly {{told him it}} was produced using a [...] "double-bifurcated sploshing flange". Only years later did Martin learn that another technique, also called flanging, was already in use. The term referred to an engineer's alternately pressing and releasing his finger against the flange (rim) of the <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> on one of two synchronized tape machines as the same audio signal was combined and transferred to a third machine, slightly slowing the machine then allowing it to come back up to speed and in sync with the other, applying a [...] "swooshing" [...] comb filtering effect to the combined audio signal. Alternatively, the engineer could press the flange of one <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> then the other to achieve a fuller effect.|$|E
50|$|The EIAJ {{format is}} a {{standard}} half-inch format used by various manufacturers. EIAJ-1 is an open-reel format. EIAJ-2 uses a cartridge that contains a <b>supply</b> <b>reel,</b> but not the take-up reel. Since the take-up reel {{is part of the}} recorder, the tape has to be fully rewound before removing the cartridge, which is a relatively slow procedure.|$|E
50|$|The above {{describes}} a typical transport system; however, manufacturers engineered many alternative designs. For example, some designs used a horizontal transport deck where the operator simply set the tape reel in the <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> bay, {{closed the door}} and pressed the load button, then a vacuum system would draw the tape along the path and onto a take-up hub within the mechanism. Some designs eliminated the vacuum columns in favor of a microprocessor-controlled direct drive design.|$|E
5000|$|Where {{limited space}} is available, {{and a fresh}} water tank cannot be fitted, the machine will still retain its demand tank, {{but it will be}} fed from an outdoor [...] "garden" [...] water tap via a {{separate}} <b>supply</b> hose <b>reel.</b> This, of course, requires that the property has an external cold water tap, which can be hard to find on some commercial sites. However, by carrying a range of different fittings, a tap key (for taps that have their handle removed to avoid unwanted water usage), and enough hose on the reel, the cleaner will usually be able to handle this situation.|$|R
40|$|Magnetic tape {{recorder}} employs a single capstan for simultaneously driving the <b>supply</b> and take-up <b>reels</b> {{in such a}} manner that the tape passing between the reels is kept under a predetermined constant tension. This recorder operates with little power and is sufficiently rugged to withstand the severe stresses encountered in high-altitude balloon flight tests...|$|R
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of the RCA tape cartridge over reel-to-reel machines is convenience. The user {{is not required to}} handle unruly tape ends and thread the tape through the machine before use, making the medium of magnetic tape more friendly to casual users. In addition, since the cartridge carries both <b>supply</b> and take-up <b>reels,</b> the cartridge {{does not have to be}} rewound before the tape is removed from the machine and stored. Because of these conveniences, the RCA tape cartridge system did see some success in schools, particularly in student language learning labs.|$|R
5000|$|Historically, movie {{projectors}} {{prior to}} modern automation {{would include a}} bell, activated by centrifugal force when the <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> reached an appropriate speed. Two projectors would be used, requiring that the projectionist switch between the [...] "operating" [...] and [...] "ready" [...] projectors when a cue mark was visible on the screen in the upper right corner. The bell alerted the projectionist (who had likely viewed the movie too many times to ensure alertness) that attention was required.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} claimed that George Martin's pseudoscientific {{explanation}} of ADT ("We take the original image and we split {{it through a}} double-bifurcated sploshing flange") given to Lennon originated the phrase flanging in recording, as Lennon would refer to ADT as [...] "Ken's flanger", although other sources claim the term originated from pressing a finger on the tape recorder's tape <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> (the flange) to make small adjustments to the phase of the copy relative to the original.|$|E
50|$|Reel-to-reel or open-reel {{audio tape}} {{recording}} is {{the form of}} magnetic tape audio recording in which the recording medium is held on a reel, rather than being securely contained within a cassette. In use, the <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> or feed reel containing the tape is mounted on a spindle; {{the end of the}} tape is manually pulled out of the reel, threaded through mechanical guides and a tape head assembly, and attached by friction to the hub of a second, initially empty takeup reel.|$|E
50|$|The paper rolls were 120 ft long. A {{metal bar}} above the take-up reel allowed a {{finished}} plot {{to be torn}} off and removed. The drum would then be advanced using the manual controls and the fresh paper end taped to the take-up reel. The standard pen was a ball-point, but liquid ink pens were available, and typically used for higher quality plots intended for publication. Other paper stock could be taped to the drum if desired. A chart drive switch was provided {{to turn off the}} motorized paper <b>supply</b> and take-up <b>reels</b> for this purpose.|$|R
5000|$|A {{more recent}} {{development}} (which suits {{a small number}} of applications better) allows for induction sealing to be used to apply a foil seal to a container without the need for a closure. In this case, foil is supplied pre-cut or in a <b>reel.</b> Where <b>supplied</b> in a <b>reel,</b> it is die cut and transferred onto the container neck. When the foil is in place, it is pressed down by the seal head, the induction cycle is activated and the seal is bonded to the container. This process is known as direct application or sometimes [...] "capless" [...] induction sealing.|$|R
5000|$|Fly reels {{are often}} rated for a {{specific}} weight and type of fly line in combination with a specific strength and length of backing. For example, the documentation <b>supplied</b> with a <b>reel</b> may state that the reel can take 150 yd of 50 pound-test backing and 30 yd of fly line. An angler {{should be able to}} [...] "load" [...] the reel with the specified length of line and backing and still have sufficient room between the line and the spool's edge. As well, many modern reels are designed to take interchangeable spools. Such spools can be quickly switched, thus allowing an angler to change the type of line in a matter of minutes.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{the supply}} and take-up spools of the {{recording}} tape were no longer individually powered as in the UNITYPER 1, a mechanical solution consisting of a differential spring, ratching escapement and slip clutches was developed to overcome the problem of [...] "differential moment" [...] of accurately moving tape across the head. This was necessary because the <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> is always decreasing in effective diameter while the take up reel is increasing in effective diameter as the tape moves from one reel to the other during encoding, and again when backspacing or rewinding.|$|E
50|$|Frippertronics (a term {{coined by}} poet Joanna Walton, Fripp's girlfriend {{in the late}} 1970s) is an analog delay system {{consisting}} of two side-by-side reel-to-reel tape recorders. The machines are configured so that the tape travels from the <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> of the first machine to the take-up reel of the second, allowing sound recorded by the first machine to be played back later on the second. The audio of the second machine is routed back to the first, causing the delayed signal to repeat while new audio is mixed in with it. The amount of delay (usually three to five seconds) is controlled by increasing or reducing {{the distance between the}} machines.|$|E
5000|$|The capstan is a {{rotating}} spindle used to move recording tape through {{the mechanism of}} a tape recorder. The tape is threaded between the capstan and one or more rubber-covered wheels, called pinch rollers, which press against the capstan, thus providing friction necessary for the capstan to pull the tape. The capstan is always placed downstream (in the direction of tape motion) from the tape heads. To maintain the required tension against the tape heads and {{other part of the}} tape transport, a small amount of drag is placed on the <b>supply</b> <b>reel.</b> Tape recorder capstans have a function similar to nautical capstans, which however have no pinch rollers, the line simply being wound around them.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{professional}} recorders usually use a three-motor scheme. One motor with {{a constant}} rotational speed drives the capstan. This, usually {{combined with a}} rubber pinch roller, ensures that the tape speed does not fluctuate. The other two motors, which are called Torque Motors, apply equal and opposite torques to the supply and take up reels during recording and play back functions and maintain the tape's tension. During fast winding operations the pinch roller is disengaged and the take up <b>reel</b> motor is <b>supplied</b> with a higher voltage than the supply motor. The cheapest models use a single motor for all required functions; the motor drives the capstan directly and the <b>supply</b> and take-up <b>reels</b> are loosely coupled to the capstan motor with slipping belts or clutches. There are also variants with two motors, in which one motor is used for rewinding only.|$|R
50|$|The tape {{motion in}} the UNISERVO I was {{controlled}} by a single capstan connected to a synchronous motor. <b>Supply</b> and take-up <b>reel</b> motion was buffered via a complex pulley-string-spring arrangement, as the design was prior to {{the invention of the}} vacuum column buffer. The tape drive contained a permanent leader, and each tape reel had a connector link to the leader. The nickel-plated phosphor bronze tapes were very abrasive, and to counter this problem a thin plastic wear tape was slowly moved over the recording head, between the head and the tape, preventing the recording head from quickly wearing out. The metal tapes also were dirty, and a slowly renewed felt wiper collected tape debris. The UNISERVO I had a high-speed rewind capability, and multiple drives on the UNIVAC I could rewind while others continued with data processing reads or writes.|$|R
50|$|Single-8 cartridges, {{without a}} press plate, {{are of a}} {{different}} design from a Super 8 cartridge, resembling a cassette-style design (<b>supply</b> and take-up <b>reels</b> side by side) as opposed to Super 8's coaxial cartridge design (one reel {{on top of the}} other). Therefore, Single-8 film cartridges can only be used in Single-8 cameras. However, the film loaded in a Single-8 cartridge has exactly the same dimensions as Super 8 (though it is made of a thinner and stronger polyester base, rather than the acetate base of Super 8 film), and can be viewed in any Super 8 projector after processing. However, Fuji recommended that only tape splices be used when combining Single-8 footage with Super-8, as cement would cause damage to the Single-8 footage. Also, when jammed, Single-8 footage had a tendency to stretch in the projector, unlike the acetate-based Super-8 film, which simply broke.|$|R
5000|$|The three biggest {{problems}} with paper tape were: * Reliability. It was common practice to follow each mechanical copying of a tape with a manual hole-by-hole comparison.* Rewinding {{the tape was}} difficult and prone to problems. Great care was needed to avoid tearing the tape. Some systems used fanfold paper tape rather than rolled paper tape. In these systems, no rewinding was necessary nor were any fancy <b>supply</b> <b>reel,</b> takeup reel, or tension arm mechanisms required; the tape merely fed from the supply tank through the reader to the takeup tank, refolding itself back into exactly the same form as when it was fed into the reader.* Low information density. Datasets much larger than a few dozen kilobytes are impractical to handle in paper tape format.|$|E
50|$|In most cassettes, the {{magnetic}} tape {{is attached to}} each spool with a leader, usually made of strong plastic.

5000|$|In 1968, {{the record}} {{producer}} for The Litter, Warren Kendrick, devised {{a method to}} precisely control flanging by placing two 15 IPS (inches per second) stereo Ampex tape recorders side by side. The take-up reel of recorder A and <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> of B were disabled, as were channel 2 of recorder A, channel 1 of recorder B and the erase head of recorder B. The tape was fed left-to-right across both recorders and an identical signal was recorded on each channel of the tape, but displaced by approximately 18 inches {{along the length of}} the tape. During recording, an ordinary screwdriver was wedged between the recorders to make the tape run [...] "uphill" [...] and [...] "downhill." [...] The same configuration was employed during the playback/mixdown to a third recorder. The screwdriver was moved back and forth to cause the two signals to diverge, then converge. The latter technique permits zero point flanging; i.e., the lagging signal crosses over the leading signal and the signals change places.|$|E
5000|$|The tape {{transport}} {{used on the}} LINC {{is essentially}} the same as the Type 555 transport, with the same interface signals and the same physical tape medium. The LINC and DEC controllers, however, are incompatible, and the positions of the <b>supply</b> and take-up <b>reels</b> were reversed between the LINC and DEC tape formats. While LINCtape supports high-speed bidirectional block search, it only supports actual data read and write operations in the forward direction. DECtape uses a significantly different mark track format to provide for the possibility of read and write operations in either direction, although not all DECtape controllers support reverse read.DEC applied for a patent on the enhanced features incorporated into DECtape in late 1964. [...] It is notable that the inventor listed on this patent, Thomas Stockebrand, is also an author of the paper on the TX-2 tape system from which the LINC tape was derived.|$|R

More precisely I deal with particular tokamak that was brought from Culham to the Prague and its power supply, which became a problem. It is tokamak model COMPASS D. My work consists in power <b>supplying</b> of tokamak <b>reels</b> and power elements in its supply way.

50|$|U-matic is an {{analogue}} recording videocassette format first shown by Sony in prototype in October 1969, and {{introduced to the}} market in September 1971. It {{was among the first}} video formats to contain the videotape inside a cassette, as opposed to the various reel-to-reel or open-reel formats of the time. Unlike most other cassette-based tape formats, the <b>supply</b> and take-up <b>reels</b> in the cassette turn in opposite directions during playback, fast-forward, and rewind: one reel would run clockwise while the other would run counter-clockwise. A locking mechanism integral to each cassette case secures the tape hubs during transportation to keep the tape wound tightly on the hubs. Once the cassette is taken off the case, the hubs are free to spin. A spring-loaded tape cover door protects the tape from damage; when the cassette is inserted into the VCR, the door is released and is opened, enabling the VCR mechanism to spool the tape around the spinning video drum. Accidental recording is prevented by the absence of a red plastic button fitted to a hole on the bottom surface of the tape; removal of the button disabled recording.|$|R
50|$|The {{vacuum system}} {{provided}} a physical buffer between the precision {{movements of the}} capstan and the large movements of the reels by storing a short length of tape in the vacuum column under relatively low tension. The vacuum columns were chambers open at one end, the openings being {{in line with the}} tape path before and after the capstan and roller assemblies. The amount of tape in the column was controlled by four optical or vacuum sensors {{on the sides of the}} columns. The control electronics kept the curve of the tape loop between the two inner sensors, cueing the <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> to feed more or the take-up reel to take more as necessary. The outer two sensors, at the very top and bottom of the columns, served to sense malfunctions in the feed mechanism during operation, prompting the control electronics to shut off all operation of the tape transport and vacuum system to prevent damaging the tape. Because of the tension provided by the vacuum columns and the design of the tape path, tape was usually kept in sufficient contact with the relatively high-friction coating on the capstan that a pinch roller was not used.|$|E
50|$|The Teletype Model 28 RT Set is {{punched tape}} message and data relay set that receives, punches, prints, stores, reads and transmits five-level paper tape. The {{receiving}} unit accepts incoming electrical signals and punches and prints the intelligence on five-level paper tape. The sending unit reads and translates the taped intelligence into electrical impulses for transmission either cross-office or cross-country. The paper tape readers and punches can be geared at {{speeds up to}} 200 words-per-minute. Gears are also available for slower speed operation at 60, 75 or 100 words-per-minute. Optional three-speed gear-shift mechanisms are also available for manual speed change operation at speeds of 60, 75 and 100 words-per-minute. The tape handling unit contains a large capacity tape <b>supply</b> <b>reel</b> capable of storing up to 3000 feet of paper tape, an intermediate tape storage bin that handles approximately 100 feet of paper tape and a tape winder reel that will store 1000 feet of paper tape. The Model 28 RT Set, less cabinet, is 35 inches high, 8.5 inches wide and 20 inches deep and weighs 110 pounds. The Model 20 RT Set cabinet, which houses up to two RT Sets, is 60 inches high, 28 inches wide and 27 inches deep and weighs 300 pounds. The RT Set cabinets may be side mounted.|$|E

50|$|Because {{the data}} rate was 5.8 million bits-per-second (5.8mbp/s), {{significant}} error detection and correction was required. A custom designed Reed-Solomon block code, was used with additional CRC characters for error correction. Interleaving of odd and even audio samples {{was performed to}} protect against burst errors. Just as in audio tape machines, transport problems with tension, guides, and <b>supply</b> and take-up <b>reels</b> could result in vertical or horizontal weave, and as bit sizes were only 14μm, precise timing and tracking was essential, thus the CDS system required installation of special projector modifications to smooth the film path travel and steady the take-up speed. It was found later, however, that modifications to the projectors were not needed and that the CDS systems sensitivity to improper film speed was due to a diode installed incorrectly in the CDS decoder module. Horizontal tracking was provided by a 76-MHz digital servo, while vertical timing was accomplished with an algorithm written into the data format itself. Rows of data were scanned horizontally, thus a self-clocking run-length-limited code was used for this error correction. A 6-to-8-bit mapping was performed upon encoding to ensure that each 8-bit word contained exactly four ones. This form of parity worked well in correcting errors upon decoding.|$|R
5000|$|Telegraph trains were {{introduced}} by Myer to support telegraphy for mobile operations. The horse-drawn wagons carried the telegraph sets and <b>supplies</b> such as <b>reels</b> of {{insulated copper wire}} and iron lances, for stringing temporary field lines, a practice called [...] "flying telegraph lines." [...] Each train consisted of two wagons, equipped with 5 miles of wire and a telegraph instrument. The first model train was constructed by Henry J. Rogers, a telegraphic engineer from New York City {{who had worked with}} Samuel F.B. Morse in building the first commercial telegraph line between Washington and Baltimore in 1844. Rogers's original telegraph instrument for the train replaced the traditional sending key and sound receiver with a dial indicator, a circular index plate bearing the letters of the alphabet and a pointer that turned to the letter to be transmitted. A similar pointer spelled out the message at the receiving end. Rogers provided a galvanic battery that eliminated the danger of acid spills. This equipment eliminated the need for skilled operators who had to be trained in Morse code. Field trials in February 1862 found that it worked satisfactorily over a test circuit of 2 miles of wire. A board of three signal officers recommended that such a train would be of great use as an auxiliary to permanent telegraph lines.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to explore the {{different}} challenges facing start-ups that are engaged in intense competition to lead the commercialization of a complex technology that is initially unable {{to meet the demands}} of a market. Technology, intellectual property, and go-to market strategies are proposed with a particular focus on wireless power technology in the market for external power adapters. Wireless power technology is a revolutionary technology that promises to replace the two billion external power adapters that are sold every year. It is a seemingly attractive opportunity for a start-up company, but the technology is complicated, the intellectual property landscape is dense, and the competition is intense. The technology will be sold into the pre-existing market for external <b>supplies,</b> which is <b>reeling</b> from declining prices and margins. The market is in need of change, and is looking for innovations that will improve the situation. The commercialization of wireless power technology is a case example of how start-up technology companies can accelerate development times, reduce risk, and build sustainable competitive advantage by carefully planning their technology approach, fully understanding the intellectual property landscape, and leveraging the principles of open innovation. A technology strategy requires the selection of a technology vector which should be determined by weighing the importance of individual product features against the expected levels of technical risk. (cont.) Within its technology vector, a company must evaluate the strategic importance the various engineering activities based on whether they enable freedom to operate, contribute to the creation of blocking patents, and/or are outside the expertise of potential partner organizations. The start-up should intensely focus its engineering resources on the strategically important activities while farming the remainder of the development work to partner organizations within the greater value chain. A start-up entrenched in a competitive battle to serve a hungry market; with a green technology solution, faces a difficult choice: go to market niche by niche and face irrelevance in the greater market, or swing for the fences and risk bankruptcy. There are options beyond the traditional approaches, and in this case, a three track commercialization strategy is appropriate. by Ryan Tseng. Thesis (M. B. A.)
