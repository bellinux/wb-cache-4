500|$|On March 2012, critics {{speculated that}} Calvin Harris and Cheryl were collaborating {{on a track}} {{following}} a Twitter discussion between them both. When {{asked if he would}} like to work with Cheryl, Harris said, [...] "I'd love to work with <b>somebody</b> <b>like</b> Cheryl Cole, she would be great." [...] The following month, it was confirmed that the track was titled [...] "Call My Name", and it would be released as the lead single from Cheryl's third studio album, A Million Lights, on 10 June 2012. The song was written and produced by Harris, and was initially offered to singer Rita Ora, who reportedly turned it down after she decided it wasn't her style of music. The track had its radio premiere on Capital FM's breakfast show on 23 April 2012.|$|E
500|$|Journalists {{noted the}} tracks' {{instrumentations}} of guitars, bass guitar, drums, vocoded, robotic and female vocals, and synthesizers used to emulate orchestral instruments, and well as compositional {{elements of a}} variety of complex builds. Downes said that he used five synthesizers in making The Age of Plastic, which were used to [...] "fake up things and to provide effects we won’t use them in the manner that <b>somebody</b> <b>like</b> John Foxx does." [...] According to Horn: [...] "We used about three different drummers including one from Landscape and Johnny Richardson from The Rubettes, who’s really good. We also used the occasional session guitarist to play various bits and there were three or four girl singers involved. Apart from that, we did everything ourselves." [...] Downes claimed of using George Shearing's trick of doubling melody lines in block chords very heavily on some of the songs.|$|E
500|$|Ford {{sponsored}} legislation {{defining a}} hate crime [...] "as an assault, intimidation or threat based on 'actual or perceived' race, religion, color, sex, age, national origin and sexual orientation." [...] He also introduced several bills concerning gay rights in lodging, hospital visitation rights and partnerships. His partnership bill would provide for civil unions in South Carolina. The effort was judged by state senator Mike Fair as predetermined to fail, but Ford cited the Democratic National Committee's platform on the issue and argued that Barack Obama's election showed that a change should be attempted. Even if passed, the measure would be unenforceable, due to a constitutional amendment banning unions similar to marriage in South Carolina. Ford worked to outlaw profanity and saggy pants and to keep music from minors that is [...] "profane, vulgar, lewd, lascivious or indecent." [...] Ford argued he did not expect these proposals to be approved but {{wanted to start a}} discussion specifically targeting young African American men's fashion as well as rap music. He stated: [...] "You don't have to emulate prisoners no more. You can emulate <b>somebody</b> <b>like</b> Barack Obama." ...|$|E

But how about now, we got about eight dudes sitting around in the studio, and now everybody jumped up and yelled 'EVIL!!!' So I was like 'Cool' because I'm like, 'I wanna sing on this record somehow, that's how I can do it,' totally unplanned you know?! Sure enough they were like, 'Fuck we have the time, let's do it.'

500|$|MGM held open casting {{sessions}} in London, Los Angeles, and New York {{for the role}} of Tank Girl. According to Talalay, some were skeptical of the open casting, thinking that it was a publicity stunt. This was true to an extent, as she had been asking the studio to cast a well-known English actress, Emily Lloyd, who was replaced after she refused to cut her hair for the role. Talalay cast Lori Petty, an American, because [...] "she is crazy in her own life and [...] needed <b>somebody</b> <b>like</b> that." [...] MGM faxed Deadline asking them for an [...] "ideal cast" [...] list; they selected Malcolm McDowell for Kesslee, but never believed MGM would actually contact him. McDowell has spoken favorably of his experience working on the film, saying it had the [...] "same flavour" [...] as A Clockwork Orange, and praised Talalay and Petty. Talalay was approached by several people who wanted cameos in the film, but she did not want the film to be overshadowed by such appearances. Two cameos were settled on – Iggy Pop was given the role of Rat Face, and Björk was offered Sub Girl. She later dropped out, her character's scenes were re-written, and the role was then given to Ann Cusack.|$|E
500|$|Many Stanford alumni {{were upset}} with the {{decision}} to hire Shaughnessy. The most popular candidates for the vacant position were two Stanford alumni themselves: San Jose State coach Dudley DeGroot, and Santa Clara coach Buck Shaw. Some believed the Shaughnessy hiring was a ploy to eventually eliminate football at the school, as had happened at both Loyola and Chicago the year prior. The Bay Area media mocked the Shaughnessy hiring as comically inept. They believed that a prestigious academic school had foolishly hired an inveterate loser as its head coach. Prescott Sulivan of the San Francisco Examiner and Jack McDonald of the San Francisco Call-Bulletin coined the nickname [...] "Soup" [...] for Shaughnessy, which they sarcastically explained was a diminutive for the word [...] "super". Sullivan wrote, [...] "We have heard it said that Shaughnessy has developed the knack of losing to the point where, with him, it is an exact science. In light of his record, we aren't at all surprised at this." [...] The Stanford players were also skeptical of Shaughnessy's abilities. Center Milt Vucinich said, [...] "We'd been reading about all those beatings Shaughnessy's men had taken, so we were joking among ourselves that wasn't it just like Stanford to hire <b>somebody</b> <b>like</b> this to coach us." ...|$|E

500|$|Sullivan Stapleton plays Damien Scott, {{a former}} United States Delta Force {{operator}} who {{is familiar with}} the antagonists of the second series, and an acquaintance of John Porter. He is recruited by Section 20 to help Sergeant Michael Stonebridge find and rescue the kidnapped Porter. Stapleton describes Scott as cocky, rebellious and arrogant, and that it was good to have <b>somebody</b> <b>like</b> him in Section 20 because [...] "he is the one that usually goes in first and takes the bullets, whereas Stonebridge arrives at the last minute and saves the day." [...] The actor opined that Scott is chosen for the dangerous role because he is daring and does not have any immediate family members who rely on him. Of Scott and Stonebridge's working relationship, Stapleton said [...] "they have a professional respect for each other" [...] but start to annoy each other. When the actor first read the script for Project Dawn, he saw himself for the role as Scott. Because Stapleton is an Australian actor, he had to speak with an American accent throughout the series. He was wary whether he did it right because he barely worked with Americans on the show, but believed he did okay when HBO, the network that operated Cinemax, was satisfied with it. Stapleton has signed up for another Strike Back series should it be commissioned.|$|E
500|$|Contributing to psychedelia's {{emergence}} {{into the}} pop mainstream was {{the release of}} Beach Boys' Pet Sounds (May 1966) and the Beatles' Revolver (August 1966). Often {{considered one of the}} earliest albums in the canon of psychedelic rock, Pet Sounds contained many elements that would be incorporated into psychedelia, with its artful experiments, psychedelic lyrics based on emotional longings and self-doubts, elaborate sound effects and new sounds on both conventional and unconventional instruments. The album track [...] "I Just Wasn't Made for These Times" [...] contained the first use of theremin sounds on a rock record. Scholar Philip Auslander says that even though psychedelic music is not normally associated with the Beach Boys, the [...] "odd directions" [...] and experiments in Pet Sounds [...] "put it all on the map. ... basically that sort of opened the door — not for groups to be formed or to start to make music, but certainly to become as visible as say Jefferson Airplane or <b>somebody</b> <b>like</b> that." [...] Like Pet Sounds, Revolver explored musical soundscapes that could not be replicated in concert, even with the addition of an orchestra. The Beatles' May 1966 B-side [...] "Rain", recorded during the Revolver sessions, was the first pop recording to include reversed sounds. It makes full use of an assortment of studio tricks such as varispeed and backwards taping, combining them with a droning melody that further highlights a growing interest in non-Western musical form. Author Simon Philo believes the song to be [...] "the birth of British psychedelic rock". [...] Author Steve Turner recognises the Beatles' success in conveying an LSD-inspired worldview on Revolver, particularly on [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows", as having [...] "opened the doors to psychedelic rock (or acid rock)".|$|E
500|$|Writing [...] "The Sleeper" [...] {{sees the}} {{characters}} in a different light. Although they are the protagonists who work to prevent terrorist threats, the episode sees the MI5 team going {{to great lengths to}} get the sleeper agent, Fred Roberts, {{to do what they want}} him to do so that the producers can make the audience sympathise with the character, as well as despise the main characters on some level for their methods. There were other instances of the main character going through great lengths to solve the case, including Adam's interrogation methods, brinking on torture, in [...] "Frequently Asked Questions". [...] "Love and Death" [...] sees Danny and Zoe ordered to carry out an assassination. Wolstencroft did not want to do it lightly, as he wanted <b>somebody</b> <b>like</b> Danny going through [...] "something dreadful." [...] He previously did it before with the death of Helen Flynn in [...] "Looking After Our Own", but [...] "Love and Death" [...] did this in the point of view of the killer, not the victim. [...] "Celebrity" [...] introduces a new plot style, which does not involve terror threats. Brenton wrote it as a more light-hearted episode that saw the characters emmeshed in a world they cannot handle. Despite this, Collins stated that MI5 do other duties other than fighting terrorism, though they would not gain as much media attention. Penhale also stated MI5 in the episode are in a way protecting the country, as if a national icon is under threat, the country's morale could drop. [...] "Who Guards the Guards?" [...] and [...] "Frequently Asked Questions" [...] were considered for the second series, but because there was not room for them, the producers bumped the episodes back to the third series.|$|E

500|$|Ebert {{gave the}} film 3.5 stars out of 4, {{saying that there}} was [...] "a lot of craft and slyness lurking beneath the circa-1960s goofiness," [...] also stating that [...] "The point, however, is not the plot but the energy. Without <b>somebody</b> <b>like</b> Nikki Blonsky {{at the heart of}} the movie, it might fall flat, but {{everybody}} works at her level of happiness..." [...] Ebert also noted that this film is [...] "a little more innocent than Waters would have made it..." [...] Krishna Shenoi, of the Shenoi Chronicle, called the movie [...] "Shankman's masterpiece," [...] saying that it moved away from his previous works into a different direction, making a light comedy that deals with serious issues maturely. Shenoi also said that the film was everything he wanted Grease to be. Lou Lumenick of The New York Post hailed Hairspray as [...] "The best and most entertaining movie adaptation of a stage musical so far this century— and yes, I’m including the Oscar-winning Chicago," [...] calling it [...] "one of the best-cast movies in recent memory..." [...] New York Daily News critic Jack Matthews called the film [...] "A great big sloppy kiss of entertainment for audiences weary of explosions, CGI effects and sequels, sequels, sequels." [...] The Baltimore Sun review offered Michael Sragow's opinion that [...] "in its entirety, Hairspray has the funny tilt that only a director-choreographer like Shankman can give to a movie," [...] pointing out that Shankman skillfully [...] "puts a new-millennial zing behind exact re-creations of delirious period dances like the Mashed Potato." [...] Dana Stevens from Slate called Hairspray [...] "intermittently tasty, if a little too frantically eager to please." [...] Stevens noted that [...] "Despite its wholesomeness, this version stays remarkably true to the spirit of the original, with one size-60 exception: John Travolta as Edna Turnblad," [...] saying [...] "How you feel about Hairspray will depend entirely on your reaction to this performance..." ...|$|E
