Most of them had been sold by that time and another 50 were with Silvert in New York. Only three were at Orgonon. The FDA agents were not allowed to destroy them, only to <b>supervise</b> the destruction, so Reich's friends and his son, Peter, chopped them up with axes as the agents watched. Once they were destroyed, Reich placed an American flag on top of them.|$|E

5|$|The idea of {{a control}} system was {{inspired}} by Vladimir Lenin in The State and Revolution. Lenin argued that every communist vanguard party, at all levels, needed a system to <b>supervise</b> party-official elections, dismissals and performance. His writings led {{to the establishment of}} the Soviet Central Control Commission; the control system and the Communist Party of China (CPC) structure were imported to China. The importance of discipline and supervision was emphasised since the CPC's founding. The 2nd National Congress amended the party constitution, devoting a chapter to party discipline. However, no institution was established to safeguard party norms or <b>supervise</b> cadre behaviour. Until the establishment of the Central Control Commission (CCC) at the 5th National Congress in 1927, local party committees were responsible for supervising members and control commissions were established at the central and provincial level.|$|E

40|$|Hashing {{has been}} widely used for {{large-scale}} search due to its low storage cost and fast query speed. By using <b>supervised</b> information, <b>supervised</b> hashing can significantly outperform unsupervised hashing. Recently, discrete <b>supervised</b> hashing and deep hashing are two representative progresses in <b>supervised</b> hashing. On one hand, hashing is essentially a discrete optimization problem. Hence, utilizing <b>supervised</b> information to directly guide discrete (binary) coding procedure can avoid sub-optimal solution and improve the accuracy. On the other hand, deep hashing, which integrates deep feature learning and hash-code learning into an end-to-end architecture, can enhance the feedback between feature learning and hash-code learning. The key in discrete <b>supervised</b> hashing is to adopt <b>supervised</b> information to directly guide the discrete coding procedure in hashing. The key in deep hashing is to adopt the <b>supervised</b> information to directly guide the deep feature learning procedure. However, there have not existed works which can use the <b>supervised</b> information to directly guide both discrete coding procedure and deep feature learning procedure in the same framework. In this paper, we propose a novel deep hashing method, called deep discrete <b>supervised</b> hashing (DDSH), to address this problem. DDSH is the first deep hashing method which can utilize <b>supervised</b> information to directly guide both discrete coding procedure and deep feature learning procedure, and thus enhance the feedback between these two important procedures. Experiments on three real datasets show that DDSH can outperform other state-of-the-art baselines, including both discrete hashing and deep hashing baselines, for image retrieval...|$|R
