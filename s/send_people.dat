25|$|Considering the country's {{brain drain}} and its poor {{political}} {{relationship with the}} United States and some other Western countries, Iran's scientific community remains productive, even while economic sanctions {{make it difficult for}} universities to buy equipment or to <b>send</b> <b>people</b> to the United States to attend scientific meetings. Furthermore, Iran considers scientific backwardness, as one of the root causes of political and military bullying by developed countries over developing states. After the Iranian Revolution, there have been efforts by the religious scholars to assimilate Islam with modern science and this is seen by some as the reason behind the recent successes of Iran to augment its scientific output. Currently Iran aims for a national goal of self-sustainment in all scientific arenas. Many individual Iranian scientists, along with the Iranian Academy of Medical Sciences and Academy of Sciences of Iran, are involved in this revival. The Comprehensive Scientific Plan has been devised based on about 51,000 pages of documents and includes 224 scientific projects that must be implemented by the year 2025.|$|E
25|$|On April 20, Abkhazia {{reported}} that around 10 am of that day, it had shot down another spy plane over {{the village of}} Gagida in Gali district. Georgian television station Mze TV {{reported that}} this had been confirmed by Georgian State Minister for Reintegration Temur Iakobashvili, while Georgian agency InterPressNews reported that an eyewitness had seen how an unmanned aeroplane flew over the coastline {{near the village of}} Primorskoe, followed by a jet, which then shot down the unmanned plane. Still, that day the Georgian Ministry of Defence initially denied that its spy plane had been shot down, stating that it was not conducting any flights over Abkhazia, and that Abkhazian reports were misinformation. In an interview to Mze TV, State Minister for Reintegration Iakobashvili stated that Abkhazia did not possess the technical capability for shooting down unmanned aircraft. According to Iakobashvili there was information that an incident involving an explosion had taken place in the Gali district, and he confirmed that eyewitnesses had seen aircraft, but since Georgia could not <b>send</b> <b>people</b> to the site, it was impossible to determine what had happened. He denounced what had taken place as further attempts to stage a military provocation.|$|E

MacArthur had been dissatisfied with the performance of his air commander, Lieutenant General George Brett. Andrews, by then a major general, turned down the job, and, offered a choice between Kenney and Major General James Doolittle, MacArthur chose Kenney. Kenney reported to MacArthur in Brisbane on 28 July 1942, and was treated to [...] "a lecture for approximately an hour on the shortcomings of the Air Force in general, and the Allied Air Forces in the Southwest Pacific in particular." [...] Kenney felt that MacArthur did not understand air operations, but recognized that he somehow needed to establish a good working relationship with him. When he asked MacArthur for authority to <b>send</b> <b>people</b> he considered [...] "deadwood" [...] home, something that his superiors in Washington, D.C. had refused to give, MacArthur enthusiastically approved.|$|E

Police officer Eddie Thawne proposes to capture the Flash because he was at the crime scene, but is rejected by the captain. The police track Bivolo to a warehouse, where he uses his abilities on a cop to facilitate his escape. Barry Allen arrives in time to save Joe West, but is almost injured himself before Oliver Queen, as the [...] "Arrow", arrives to stop the cop. Later, Oliver informs Barry that he and his team are in Central City tracking a killer who uses lethal boomerangs. Barry suggests that they team-up to catch each other's targets and Oliver reluctantly agrees. Oliver tries to teach Barry to be more mindful of his surroundings, but Barry decides to go after Bivolo by himself. Bivolo uses his abilities on Barry; but because of Barry's powers it makes the effects last longer.|$|E

Tim Sendra of Allmusic selected {{it as one}} of the 'track picks' of When the Sun Goes Down, calling it a [...] "stomping jam" [...] and one of the surprises of the album. He stated that the song [...] "adds some welcome weirdness to an otherwise straightforward record." [...] In a positive review, Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post suggested that [...] "Whiplash" [...] was better than at least five songs from Spears's seventh studio album Femme Fatale (2011), saying [...] "what I can't figure out is {{why in the world would}} [...] give up this hot track". Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly commented that [...] "the top-shelf collaborators don't hurt — see: the grinding 'Whiplash,' co-penned by one Britney Spears."

While there is potential for the entire Beatles catalogue to be made available, this will be unlikely, according to John Drake of Harmonix. Drake identified the costly development process as a potentially prohibitive factor: [...] "Every time we do one song, it's not like Rock Band where {{we wait for the}} masters to come in and just author them... its like, <b>send</b> <b>people</b> to Abbey Road, use the original tape, separate them out... it costs thousands of dollars." [...] Drake asserted that Harmonix would take sales of the currently announced albums into consideration before continuing development of downloadable content. Harmonix's Foster stated that solo acts from the Beatles' members will not be included as downloadable content for The Beatles: Rock Band; however, he did not rule out the possibility of these acts appearing in other Rock Band games.

After the war, Yugoslavia, Greece and Ethiopia requested the extradition of 1,200 Italian war criminals for trial, but they never saw anything like the Nuremberg trials because the British government with the beginning of the Cold War saw in Pietro Badoglio a guarantee of an anti-communist post-war Italy. The repression of memory led to historical revisionism in Italy about the country's actions during the war. In 1963, anthology [...] "Notte sul'Europa", a photograph of an internee from Rab concentration camp, was included while claiming to be a photograph of an internee from a German Nazi camp when in fact the internee was a Slovene Janez Mihelčič, born 1885 in Babna Gorica and died at Rab in 1943.
