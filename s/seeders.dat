25|$|Fynbos shrublands {{occur in}} a small belt across South Africa. The plant species in this {{ecosystem}} are highly diverse, yet {{the majority of these}} species are obligate <b>seeders,</b> that is, a fire will cause germination of the seeds and the plants will begin a new life-cycle because of it. These plants may have coevolved into obligate <b>seeders</b> as a response to fire and nutrient-poor soils. Because fire is common in this ecosystem and the soil has limited nutrients, it is most efficient for plants to produce many seeds and then die in the next fire. Investing a lot of energy in roots to survive the next fire when those roots will be able to extract little extra benefit from the nutrient-poor soil would be less efficient. It is possible that the rapid generation time that these obligate <b>seeders</b> display has led to more rapid evolution and speciation in this ecosystem, resulting in its highly diverse plant community.|$|E

Since so much of this population is engaged in agriculture, these NGOs have addressed market gaps that enable small-scale (i.e., plots less than 2 hectares) farmers to increase their production and find markets for their harvests. This is done by increasing the availability of farming equipment (e.g., pumps, tillers, <b>seeders)</b> and better quality seed and fertilizer, as well as expanding access for training in farming best practices (e.g., crop rotation).|$|E

The <b>seeder</b> is suitable for the small farmers who have practice of direct seeding of onion under dry land cultivation. The <b>seeder</b> consists of a frame, a PVC drum, furrow openers, furrow closer, wheels and handle. In 2009 - 2010, the <b>seeder</b> was fabricated in FMP Engineering divisional workshop and tested in experimental plot, BARI, Gazipur. Seed rate of the <b>seeder</b> was 4 kg ha- 1 and field capacity was 0. 08 ha hr- 1. Weight and price of the <b>seeder</b> were 5. 5 kg and Tk 2500 per unit, respectively.

40|$|Germination is a {{key process}} in the {{dynamics}} of weed populations. In no-tillage systems, crop seeding is often found to induce seed germination in the seeding strip. In this research, experiments to investigate options for reducing weed seedling establishment were conducted in no-till soyabean fields located in two sites in south Brazil. A first experiment revealed that a reduction in emergence of some important weed species {{can be achieved by}} lowering seeding speed. Further experiments showed the ability of a modified <b>seeder</b> to contribute to an additional reduction in weed establishment. On the modified <b>seeder,</b> coulter discs were equipped with lateral blades, to diminish soil disturbance and to maintain a uniform soil cover by properly cutting the mulch layer. In a field {{with a high level of}} residues, the modified <b>seeder,</b> in contrast to the standard <b>seeder,</b> prevented the increase of soil exposure when seeding at high speed. The predominant weeds were annual species. Averaged over all seeding rates, the new equipment led to a 56 % reduction in within-row weed density, compared with the standard <b>seeder.</b> Regardless of <b>seeder</b> type, overall weed density increased with seeding speed, but with the modified <b>seeder,</b> this increase was only half that of the standard <b>seeder.</b> The modified <b>seeder</b> reduced weed biomass by 30 % and increased soyabean grain yield by 42 %. The research demonstrated that relatively simple changes, like a minor modification to a <b>seeder</b> and a lower seeding speed, can contribute to more diverse and sustainable alternatives to predominantly chemical-oriented weed management strategies...|$|R

40|$|Introduction Researchers {{frequently}} include multiple cultivars {{and fertility}} levels in field experiments. Therefore, the experiments sowing operation must represent a considerable saving {{in time and}} labor, compared to hand sowing. Greater flexibility in experimental design and setup could be achieved by equipment that enables quick changes in the cultivar and fertilizer rates from one plot to the next. A satisfactory seed drill must distribute a given quantity of seed evenly over a predetermined length of coulter row, the coulters must be spaced at exact intervals and depth of sowing must be uniform. In a self-propelled type of plot <b>seeder,</b> no coulter should run in a wheel track as the compaction of the soil can cause observable differences in vigor between plants in such a row and those in un-compacted rows. The machine should sow in succession from a try in which a series of seed pocket separated clearly and must be put into distributer funnel by an assistant operator. The length of gap being varied according to the nature and purpose of the plot. The objectives of this experiment were 1 - to design and construct a local self-propelled plot <b>seeder</b> and 2 - To compare it with the imported (Wintersteiger) plot <b>seeder</b> in cereal breeding programs. Materials and Methods A small-plot <b>seeder</b> was designed and constructed to meet this objective. The unit consists of the following basic components: a toolbar for pulling a set of six blade coulter, an air compressor for lifting and putting down the openers and metering transmission drive wheel, an operators chair and work rack, one belt seed distribution. A cone-celled and rotor seed distributor is used for seed distribution to the openers. The cone system {{is connected to the}} gearbox and allows for great flexibility in changing cultivars, crop species, and plot length. This is driven by the separate drive wheel. The cone-celled distributor sows all the seed of the sample in making one complete turn. The spinner can be equipped with a 4 or 6 outlet delivery head, depending on row spacing. The planter is fitted with hoe openers. Alternatively, spear-point openers have sometimes been used under conventional tillage systems. Seeding depth control was achieved by an adjustment screw handle. The plot <b>seeder</b> is being moved by a 9. 6 kW engine, and has been successfully used in applications. Field experiment established by using 4 plot length (2, 3, 4 and 6) with 4 replication by the constructed plot <b>seeder</b> and imported plot <b>seeder.</b> Crop measurements were planted height, spike m- 2, seeds/spike, Thousand kernel weight, Biological and grain yield, harvest index and drill measurements were seeding depth, uniformity of row spacing in action, seed counter performance, power requirement, slippage evenly of rows after planting. Results and Discussion Results showed that there were significant differences between the plant emergences. The emergencies were higher in plots, which planted by the new plot <b>seeder.</b> The differences between seed distribution of openers were insignificant, but the variances of new plot <b>seeder</b> and imported plot <b>seeder</b> were 0. 267 and 1. 05 respectively. Mean planting depth of plots planted by the Wintersteiger plot <b>seeder</b> was 0. 8 cm shallower than the adjusted planting depth while mean planting depth in plots planted by constructing machine had only 0. 01 cm variation. Results of variance analysis revealed that effect of treatments on wheat grain yield and yield components was significant. So that, highest grain yield (4216 kgha- 1), biological yield (8704 kgha- 1), number of spikes per square meter (649 spike), obtained from a plot which planted by constructed plot <b>seeder.</b> Increasing yield of treatments which planted by constructed plot <b>seeder</b> might be because of increasing the number of spikes per square meter in those treatments. The mean of spike per square meter in plots of new planter was 691 spikes which were 116 spike more than plots planted by imported plot <b>seeder.</b> Conclusions The constructed plot <b>seeder</b> had up to 18500 cost reduction. The <b>seeder</b> was able to distribute the different type of seed to the seed tubes uniformly in laboratory tests, nevertheless it is necessary to test the constructed plot <b>seeder</b> in field condition by using different seed type and conducting new research project. Advantages of this planter include less variation of seed fall down in different coulters, perfect planting depth control, separate wheel for adjusting planting length, minimize the slippage of planter driven wheel and proper utility in different field condition. According to effects on crop parameters the constructed plot <b>seeder</b> had relative priority to imported one.

40|$|High {{diversification}} of woody <b>seeder</b> lineages {{is characteristic of}} the south-western cape floristic region (CFR), South Africa, which has been explained {{as a consequence of}} its mild Mediterranean climate and reliable winter rainfall. Such climatic regime reduces the risk of post-fire recruitment failure, acting as an ecological filter that favours <b>seeder</b> populations, thus promoting genetic differentiation and diversification in <b>seeder</b> populations, as previously seen in the South African heath Erica coccinea. To explore this hypothesis further, genetic population structure was investigated in two Mediterranean Erica species, one <b>seeder</b> (Erica umbellata) and the other resprouter (Erica australis), using nuclear microsatellites. These two species are endemic to the western Mediterranean Basin and co-occur in heathlands of the Strait of Gibraltar region. Mean annual rainfall in this region is similar to that from the south-western CFR, but summer stress is more marked and winter rainfall is much less reliable. Contrary to what was found in E. coccinea, average genetic diversity levels were considerably lower in <b>seeder</b> populations (E. umbellata), regardless of an apparently higher gene flow among them. No differences in genetic differentiation among populations were found between the two species. The occurrence of less favourable climatic conditions for post-fire recruitment in the western Mediterranean compared to the south-western CFR may affect <b>seeder</b> populations more strongly than resprouter and may thus account for lower levels of within-population genetic diversity in the <b>seeder</b> E. umbellata. In addition, putatively higher migration rates in the <b>seeder</b> E. umbellata, may contribute to reduce its potential for genetic differentiation. This study provides evidence that high divergence of <b>seeder</b> populations is not a general rule in fire-prone, Mediterranean-type ecosystems. Â© 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B. V.
