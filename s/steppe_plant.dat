We compared vegetation recovery following cutting and prescribed fire on three sites in late Phase 2 (mid succession) and Phase 3 (late succession) western juniper (Juniperus occidentalis Hook.) woodlands in southeast Oregon. Treatments were partial cutting followed by fall broadcast burning (SEP); clear-cut and leave (CUT); and clear-cut and burn in early winter (JAN), late winter (MAR), and spring (APR); and untreated controls. Cover and density of herbaceous, shrub, and tree layers were measured. Five years after treatment, perennial bunchgrasses dominated two sites and co-dominated, with invasive annual grasses, at one site. Except for Sandberg blue-grass (Poa secunda J.

At each site, shrub, herbaceous, and ground cover response variables equalized or had begun to converge among treatments during {{the fourth or fifth}} year following application. SEP and APR treatments were mostly effective at reducing fuel sizes up to and including 1000 -hr fuels while JAN and MAR treatments only consumed 1 -hr and 10 -hr fuels.

Currently, we have little understanding of how the importance of the storage effect varies among ecosystems. We tested for the three conditions of the storage effect in a sagebrush <b>steppe</b> <b>plant</b> community in Idaho (USA) by combining long-term observational data with statistical models. The four sagebrush steppe species that we studied satisfied the first two conditions of the storage effect: a long-lived life stage and species-specific responses to the environment. But the critical third condition, environment-competition covariance, was very weak in this community. While the direction of the covariance was consistent with a stabilizing effect of variability (stronger competition in more favorable years), its magnitude was small, reflecting low temporal variability in both competition and species responses to the environment. Consistent with this result, simulations of species population growth rates when rare showed that climate variability had no consistent stabilizing effect on coexistence. This case study provides an important reminder that species-specific responses to the environment are not sufficient for coexistence via the storage effect. Instead, the magnitude of temporal variability in species performance also plays an important role. Comparison of our results with those from a similar study in Kansas mixed prairie suggests that temporal variability in species performance may reflect both the strength of environmental variability as well as life history strategies...|$|E

A long history of shrub management exists in the sagebrush steppe of the Intermountain West where shrub-removal treatments, a type of managed disturbance, have been implemented for over 50 years to reduce sagebrush cover. The assumption behind managed disturbances {{is that they will}} increase forage for domestic livestock and improve wildlife habitat. However, the long-term effects of managed disturbance on plant community composition and diversity are not well understood. We investigated the legacy effects of three common types of managed disturbance (chemical, fire, and mechanical treatments) on plant community diversity and composition. We also examined sagebrush steppe resilience to managed disturbance. Based on management assumptions and resilience theory, we expected within-state phase shifts characterized by an initial reduction in biodiversity followed by a return to prior state conditions. We also expected changes in species proportions, characteristic of within-state shifts in state-and-transition models. We also expected an increase in non-native contribution to overall diversity. We found that plant communities experienced a fundamental shift in composition following disturbance, and responded in a flat linear fashion, giving no indication of return to prior community composition or diversity. As expected, we found post-disturbance increases in the number of non-native grass species present. However, native forb species made the largest contribution to altered diversity. Disturbance modified functional group composition, so contrary to our expectations, within-state changes did not occur as a result of disturbance.

40|$|International audienceEcological {{restoration}} {{has been}} identified as one of the possible ways to replace biodiversity loss. While ecological engineering methods can successfully restore some ecosystem attributes, restoration is generally incomplete, mainly due to lack of target species propagule dispersal, unsuitable abiotic conditions and negative biotic interactions, especially after intensive cultivation. How best to restore reference ecosystems is therefore a vital research objective, not only on a small experimental scale but also on a large scale. This study aimed to determine which ecological engineering techniques are the most suitable for large-scale restoration of a low-productive species-rich ecosystem after intensive cultivation. Experiments were carried out at La Crau in southern France, within a 357 ha land rehabilitation project whose aim was to recreate a herbaceous sheep-grazed habitat. We investigated: (i) covering species seeding, (ii) topsoil removal, (iii) hay transfer, and (iv) soil transfer as methods to restore a <b>steppe</b> <b>plant</b> community in this rehabilitated area, using the last remaining French Mediterranean steppe as a reference ecosystem. Species-richness, diversity and composition of vascular plant communities were monitored over three years. The rehabilitation made it possible to recover a large area dominated by grasses but with vegetation {{different from that of the}} steppe. Hay transfer was successful in transferring some target species, but the number of target species did not significantly increase by the end of the third year. Covering species seeding seemed to provide a suitable area for target species colonization, but probable competition with grasses needs to be monitored. The greatest similarity in richness, diversity, and composition with the reference ecosystem was obtained with topsoil removal and soil transfer, which made it possible to recover the species-richness and, to some extent, the composition of the steppe. Our findings show that current ecological restoration and ecological engineering techniques can lead to at least partial restoration of some ecosystem attributes. However, they also underline the importance of in situ conservation of natural habitats rather than restoring them after their destruction...|$|E
40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDivision of BiologyCarolyn J. FergusonThe genus Lappula Moench is {{a diverse}} group of {{herbaceous}} plants in the large, cosmopolitan family Boraginaceae. Over sixty species are recognized in Eurasia; many are found in cold deserts, steppes, and semi-deserts of Central Asia. Fewer species were described from western North America, and compared with the Asian species they are poorly known. Various North American taxa have been placed into synonomy under Eurasian species, and complex patterns of variation have made species circumscription challenging. The goal of this dissertation was to explore phylogenetic relationships between North American and Eurasian species and to revise the taxonomy of the North American species. A molecular phylogenetic study was initiated in order to infer patterns of relationships among the North American species relative to Eurasian diversity. Samples were collected from throughout the western United States and from Siberia. Additional samples of Eurasian species were taken from herbarium specimens. Sequences were generated for three DNA regions (the ITS region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA, and chloroplast intergenic spacers trnS-trnG and rpl 32 -trnL) and phylogenies were generated using parsimony and Bayesian analyses. Results were in general agreement among all analyses. The genus Lappula was recovered as a monophyletic group, {{with the exception of the}} morphologically anomalous L. sessiliflora (Boiss.)
