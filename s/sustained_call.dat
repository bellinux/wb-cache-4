50|$|Territory {{size of the}} jacky winter {{has been}} {{recorded}} to be at 1.7 ha {{which is similar to}} other species of Petroicidae such as the flame robin and scarlet robin. The jacky winter seems to favour habitats for breeding which contain a eucalyptus box woodland or open box woodland which have patches of box trees and isolated live trees. Fallen logs and stumps are also favoured in habitat selection. The jacky winter holds these territories by perching on top of these eucalyptus trees and keeping a regular <b>sustained</b> <b>call.</b> The breeding density of jacky winters is about 17.2 ha for one pair. The jacky winter is known to defend their territory all year around.|$|E

These modernisations are increasingly being framed in terms of the role of emerging technologies and more specifically, e-government and c-government to transform the operations and effectiveness of governments. As small and developing states, the region is faced with unique institutional and structural challenges to the adoption and implementation of these measures. The results of various e-government strategies have been varied across the board. This paper offers a critical assessment of e-government strategies across the Caribbean focusing on the challenges, success factors and opportunities for implementation.

40|$|The {{number of}} online environments {{language}} teachers can employ is constantly growing, offering increased potential for L 2 interaction analysis. However, research cannot necessarily {{keep up with}} technology innovation. One danger is that CALL research will reinvent the wheel each time a new technology emerges. To better understand L 2 interaction across different environments, Reffay, Betbeder & Chanier (2012) underline the need to share research situations in formats that allow comparisons between interactions in different online environments to be made and that are open-access. In the language-learning domain, learner corpora (Granger, 2004; Meunier et al., 2012) are exploited for SLA research. Frequently comprising data from test situations (Reffay et al., 2008) and used in learner-native speaker comparative studies (Botlon, Carter-Thomas & Rowley-Jolivet, 2012), learner corpora focus on learners' productions and consider neither other course participants (tutors, native speakers) nor the learning context. A LEarning and TEaching Corpus (LETEC) links, following international standards, all elements resulting from an online learning situation (Chanier & Ciekanski, 2010). It comprises a XML "manifest" which describes the corpus' components: the learning design, the research protocol (questionnaires, interview data), the interaction data (audio, textchat, video), all participants' productions and licences relating to ethics and access rights. The XML schema allows interactions from different tools and environments (conceptual map editor, blogs, synthetic worlds [...] .) to be stored and described in a standardized way, facilitating data analysis. Interaction data is included in environment-independent formalisms. Our presentation will introduce the methodology for building a LETEC. Using data from a CLIL (Content and Language Integrated Learning) course which employed the synthetic world Second Life, and analyses into nonverbal and L 2 verbal interaction in this environment (Wigham & Chanier, in press; Wigham & Chanier, 2012), we will illustrate how LETEC methodology may help <b>sustain</b> <b>CALL</b> research beyond the hype of the latest online environment...|$|R
40|$|Examines the habitat, {{microhabitat}} and {{the calling}} behaviour of the Krombit tinkerfrog, {{which is a}} critically endangered myobatrachid frog endemic to the rainforest gullies of Kroombit Tops in south-east Queensland. Taudactylus pleione (the Kroombit tinkerfrog) is a critically endangered myobatrachid frog endemic to the rainforest gullies of Kroombit Tops, an elevated plateau in southeast Queensland, Australia. Its numbers have declined in recent times, particularly at the higher altitude plateau streams. Efforts to conserve the species, including a proposal to commence captive breeding, are hampered by inadequate knowledge of the species' habitat requirements and conditions required for reproduction. This project investigated the characteristics of occupied rainforest patches and streams, microhabitat and structure of male call sites and influence of climatic variables on male calling activity. Habitat characteristics of rainforestlwet sclerophyll patches and streams used by T. pleione were compared to randomly selected unoccupied patches and streams. Callsites and call-perches used by male T. pleione were compared to available potential callsites and perches. Daily calling activity of male T. pleione was analysed in relation to climatic and other variables. Patches of notophyll rainforest and adjacent wet sclerophyll forest were mapped from aerial photography. The habitat and spatial patterns of ten patches occupied by T pleione and ten randomly selected unoccupied patches were compared. Within these, habitat and microhabitat data were compared for seven occupied and eight unoccupied streams. The habitat of T. pleione {{can be described as}} first-order streams at Kroombit Tops originating above 825 m within patches of simple notophyll gully vine forest (Regional Ecosystem 12. 12. 1) spanning more than 168 m of elevation, that are generally greater than 20 ha in area with an area-perimeter ratio of 73 or higher and a catchment of over 56 ha, no more than 207 m from the nearest occupied patch. Patches of less than 20 ha may be occupied provided they have patch roundness index values of 0. 68 or higher. Streams have generally less than 7. 9 % crevice cover and 'large pebbles' (2. 1 - 6. 0 cm) occurred at a frequency of 30 % or more. Data were collected from call-sites used by male T. pleione for advertisement calling and from randomly selected paired locations within the same gully. Occupied call-sites had significantly higher rock and crevice cover, but significantly lower slope and direct summer radiation values. Males {{were significantly more likely to}} be found using rockpiles than other call-perch structures available at the site. Preliminary analysis of the acoustic reflectivity of the call-perches used by T. pleione males, based on the density of their component materials, showed they were significantly more reflective than potential call-perches. Daily male T. pleione calling activity was recorded at one escarpment stream over 1, 836 days. Associated daily temperature and rainfall data were collected at Kroombit Tops and long-term rainfall and temperature data obtained from Bureau of Meteorology stations within 50 km of the study site. Logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between male calling behaviour at this site and meteorological and astronomical variables. The resultant modelling identified two distinct periods within the calling season: the <b>calling</b> onset and <b>sustained</b> <b>calling</b> periods. The calling onset period model explained 85. 9 % of cases using five variables describing atmospheric moisture, temperature, rainfall and moon phase. The <b>sustained</b> <b>calling</b> period model explained 77. 8 % of cases using three variables describing atmospheric moisture and rainfall. This study has provided the first quantitative data on habitat and microhabitat use by T. pleione and the methodology developed has application for further research on the habitat requirements of the species. Further, this study has greatly increased knowledge of when male T. pleione call and the factors influencing calling. These results can improve the effectiveness of future surveys and monitoring as well as providing a application to any future attempts at translocation or captive breeding of this critically endangered species...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Saccadic {{oscillations}} threaten {{clear vision}} by causing image motion on the retina. They are either purely horizontal (ocular flutter) or multidi-mensional (opsoclonus). We propose that ion channel dysfunction in the burst cell membrane is the underlying abnormality.

This biologically realistic model mimics the physiologic properties and anatomic connections in the brainstem saccade generator. A rebound firing after <b>sustained</b> inhibition, <b>called</b> post-inhibitory rebound (PIR), and reciprocal inhibition between premotor saccadic burst neurons are the key features of this conceptual scheme. PIR and reciprocal inhibition make the circuits that generate the saccadic burst inherently unstable {{and can lead to}} oscillations unless stabilized by external inhibition. Our simulations suggest that alterations in membrane properties that lead to an increase in PIR, a reduction in external glycinergic inhibition, or both can cause saccadic oscillations...|$|R
