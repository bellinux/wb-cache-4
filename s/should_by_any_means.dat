60|$|And {{these are}} the critics from whom the {{commonwealth}} of learning has in all ages received such immense benefits, that the gratitude of their admirers placed their origin in heaven, among those of Hercules, Theseus, Perseus, and other great deservers of mankind. But heroic virtue itself hath not been exempt from the obloquy of evil tongues. For it hath been objected that those ancient heroes, famous for their combating so many giants, and dragons, and robbers, were in their own persons a greater nuisance to mankind than any of those monsters they subdued; and therefore, to render their obligations more complete, when all other vermin were destroyed, should in conscience have concluded with the same justice upon themselves, as Hercules most generously did, and hath upon that score procured for himself more temples and votaries than {{the best of his}} fellows. For these reasons I suppose it is why some have conceived it would be very expedient for the public good of learning that every true critic, as soon as he had finished his task assigned, should immediately deliver himself up to ratsbane or hemp, or from some convenient altitude, and that no man's pretensions to so illustrious a character <b>should</b> <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>means</b> be received before that operation was performed.|$|E
60|$|His {{cardinal}} {{belief and}} precept was, as with Socrates, that the βίος ἀνεξέταστος {bios anexetastos} {{is not to}} be lived by man. As we have seen, the freedom of the reason was so dear to him, that he counted it an abuse for a parent to instil his own convictions into the defenceless minds of his young children. This was the natural outcome of Condorcet's mode of viewing history as the record of intellectual emancipation, while to Comte its deepest interest was as a record of moral and emotional cultivation. If we value in one type of thinker the intellectual conscientiousness, which refrains from perplexing men by propounding problems unless the solution can be set forth also, perhaps we owe no less honour in the thinker of another type to that intellectual self-denial which makes him very careful lest the too rigid projection of his own specific conclusions <b>should</b> <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>means</b> obstruct the access of a single ray of fertilising light. This religious scrupulosity, which made him abhor all interference with the freedom and openness of the understanding as the worst kind of sacrilege, was Condorcet's eminent distinction. If, as some think, the world will gradually transform its fear or love of unknowable gods into a devout reverence for those who have stirred in men a sense of the dignity of their own nature and of its large and multitudinous possibilities, then will his name not fail of deep and perpetual recollection.|$|E

The reader will recollect, perhaps, that it has already been stated that a very renowned Crusader, named Godfrey of Bouillon, had penetrated, about a hundred years before this time, into the interior of the Holy Land, {{at the head of a}} large army, and there had taken possession of Jerusalem; that the earls, and barons, and other prominent knights in his army had chosen him king of the city, and fixed the crown and the royal title upon him and his descendants forever; that when Jerusalem was itself, after a time, lost, the title still remained in Godfrey's family, and that it descended to a princess named Sibylla; that a knight named Guy of Lusignan married Sibylla, and then claimed the title of King of Jerusalem in the right of his wife; that, in process of time, Sibylla died, and then one party claimed that the rights of her husband, Guy of Lusignan, ceased, since he held them only through his wife, and that thenceforward the title and the crown vested in Isabella, her sister, who was the next heir; that Isabella, however, was married to a man who was too feeble and timid to assert his claims; that, consequently, a more bold and unscrupulous knight, named Conrad of Montferrat, seized her and carried her off, and afterward procured a divorce for her from her former husband, and married her himself; and that then a great quarrel arose between Guy of Lusignan, the husband of Sibylla, and Conrad of Montferrat, the husband of Isabella. This quarrel had now been raging a long time, and all attempts to settle it or to compromise it had proved wholly unavailing.|$|E

60|$|One terrible {{circumstance}} in this Bill, is, that {{of turning}} the tithe of flax and hemp into what the lawyers call a Modus, or a certain sum {{in lieu of a}} tenth part of the product. And by this practice of claiming a Modus in many parishes by ancient custom, the Clergy in both kingdoms have been almost incredible sufferers. Thus, in the present case, the tithe of a tolerable acre of flax, which by a medium is worth twelve shillings, is by the present Bill reduced to four shillings. Neither is this the worst part in a Modus; every determinate sum must in process of time sink from a fourth to a four-and-twentieth part, or a great deal lower, by that necessary fall attending the value of money, which is now at least nine tenths lower all over Europe than it was four hundred years ago, by a gradual decline; and even a third part at least within our own memories, in purchasing almost everything required for the necessities or conveniencies of life; as any gentleman can attest, who hath kept house for twenty years past. And this will equally affect poor countries as well as rich. For, although, I look upon it as an impossibility that this kingdom should ever thrive under its present disadvantages, which without a miracle must still increase; yet, when the whole cash of the nation shall sink to fifty thousand pounds; we must in all our traffic abroad, either of import or export, go by the general rate at which money is valued in those countries that enjoy the common privileges of human kind. For this reason, no corporation, (if the Clergy may presume to call themselves one) <b>should</b> <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>means</b> grant away their properties in perpetuity upon any consideration whatsoever; Which is a rock that many corporations have split upon, to their great impoverishment, and sometimes to their utter undoing.

40|$|The {{process of}} vilification of Richard III {{started at the}} end of the fifteenth century, when a well-planned policy of Tudor {{propaganda}} was set in motion by Henry VII himself, who commissioned a series of historiographical writings, mainly aiming at the solidification of the newly founded dynasty. One of the strategies, probably the major one, consisted in the definitive annihilation of the last Plantagenet king of England, whose defeat and death on the battlefield <b>should</b> not <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>means</b> transform him into the York victimised hero of the Wars of the Roses. Thus, various historiographers delineated Richard of Gloucester as a vile, wicked, monstrous creature. But the hyperbolic process of vilification undoubtedly reached its highest climax with two major early modern authors. The Life written by Thomas More – The History of King Richard the Third (ca. 1514) – and the play written by William Shakespeare – King Richard III (ca. 1591) – may be considered the epitomes of the tradition that has forever shaped the king as a monster. In this text, I focus on the way More and Shakespeare exploit and amplify the vituperative historiographical tradition, though mostly based on rumour, uncertainties and legendary elements. Within this widely accepted tradition, both authors manage to shape a solid portrait of Richard III, an exemplum not to be imitated or followed, but whose performance, built through a set of powerful rhetorical devices, is masterful, both in the Life and in the play...|$|R

In addition to the load-sharing algorithm, we use the concept of grouped locks, along with transaction deadline information, in order to schedule the movement of data objects in the cluster in a more efficient manner.

The theo - centric ethics should also be included to these ethics approaches that are shaped within the sphere of positive sciences. The Abrahamic r eligions, particularly Islam’s human - nature relationship conception do not fall within the scope of these three approaches. T his study stands for the assumption that the theo - centric approach is applicable to explain the human - nature relationship of the r eligion of Islam. Within this framework, initially the core of environmental problems which is the transformation of human - nature relationship from organic to mechanic relationship will be touched upon whereas the mechanic world view will also be examined. Later on, around the main sources of religion of Islam, the content of human - nature relationship will be elaborated. In this context, a new paradigm will also be proposed for current global environmental issues...|$|R
5000|$|Thion {{worked as}} a {{researcher}} at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) from 1971 to 2000. Most of his research there focused on Cambodia and Vietnam. Thion was the subject of some controversy when he wrote that [...] "genocide" [...] was, technically, not a proper description of what happened in Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge rule, because it was not a type (or an attempt) of killing based on purely ethnic grounds. According to Thion:The reality is that genocide, massacres, wiping out entire peoples or cultures, and other inhuman atrocities, torture, massive corruption, and so on, are part and parcel of government policies, most usually applied to foreign countries. There is no other law than the law of the jungle. If we want to change this situation, we must reform our own laws first, strip the authorities of their political immunity, abolish the [...] "Reason of State" [...] and the system of official secrecy which covers up all these crimes. If we could reach a stage in which any official would be tried according to the same rules that apply to you and me, to any other ordinary human being, we would not need all these extraordinary concepts because common law is quite enough.I of course fully agree that Pol Pot <b>should</b> be prevented <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>means</b> from returning to power. I find it a bit paradoxical that so much blame was poured on the Vietnamese, who did just that, prevent Pol Pot fromcoming back, by people who did so much to promote the same Pol Pot and insisted he kept his seat in the United Nations. I am also fully in favour of a trial of Pol Pot and of his accomplices and his foreign associates, including American, Thai and Chinese officials who conspired to support him when he was in power and after his fall. I suggest the application of the ordinary Cambodian law for events which took place in Cambodia.Genocide is nothing else but a political label aiming at the exclusion of a political leader or party beyond the bonds of humanity. It leads us to believe we are good, that we {{have nothing to do with}} these monsters. This is entirely misleading. Pol Pot has been produced by our political world, is part of it, is using it and is getting strong from it. Before saying he is dirty - which is what he is without a doubt - we should clean our own house first.|$|R

40|$|U radu se navode invazivne biljne vrste koje se javljaju u šumama Kalnika. Također se navodi i stanje njihove rasprostranjenosti u Hrvatskoj i njihov utjecaj na šume Kalnika. Ukupno je zabilježeno 14 invazivnih vrsta koje u šumama Kalnika stvaraju probleme, a to su – Acer negundo L. (negundovac), Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle (pajasen), Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. (ambrozija), Amorpha fruticosa L. (čivitnjača), Asclepias syriaca L. (cigansko perje), Conyza canadensis (L.) Cronquist (kanadska hudoljetnica), Echinocystis lobata (Michx.) Torr. et Gray (divlji krastavac), Erigeron annuus (L.) Pers. (krasolika), Impatiens glandulifera Royle (žljezdasti nedirak), Juncus tenuis Willd. (nježni sit), Phytolacca {{americana}} L. (vinobojka), Reynoutria japonica Houtt. (japanski dvornik), Robinia pseudoacacia L. (bagrem), Solidago gigantea Aiton (velika zlatnica). Najviše problema u šumama Kalnika čini bagrem, i to na svim tipovima staništa i u sastojinama svih starosnih skupina, a posebno su štete značajne u mladim sastojinama te u sastojinama u fazi obnove. Na površinama nakon čistih sječa a prije pošumljavanja, u mladim sastojinama i osunčanim čistinama starih sastojina u fazi obnove, štetu čine i gusti sklopovi krasolike, ambrozije, žljezdastoga nedirka i vinobojke. Ostale navedene vrste za sada nalazimo uz rubove šuma, cesta, vlaka, obalama vodotoka te na šumskim čistinama, gdje dolaze u manjim skupinama ili pojedinačno te za sada ne čine ozbiljne štete, ali su stalna prijetnja autohtonim vrstama, kao i bioraznovrsnosti. This paper {{presents an}} invasive plant species {{that occur in}} the forests of Kalnik. It also presents the state of the distribution and their impact on forests of Kalnik. A total of 14 invasive species in the forests of Kalnik and these are – Acer negundo L., Ailanthus altissima (Mill.) Swingle, Ambrosia artemisiifolia L., Amorpha fruticosa L., Asclepias syriaca L., Conyza canadensis (L.) Cronquist, Echinocystis lobata (Michx.) Torr. et Gray, Erigeron annuus (L.) Pers., Impatiens glandulifera Royle, Juncus tenuis Willd.), Phytolacca americana L., Reynoutria japonica Houtt., Robinia pseudoacacia L., Solidago gigantea Aiton. Alochtonous vegetation is not only inevitable, but it also appears to be a constant future challenge in the globalizing world which communicates on all levels with every means possible. Its influence <b>should</b> not <b>by</b> <b>any</b> <b>means</b> be marginalized. Its importance and influence is not completely negative and there are possible benefits and dangers which <b>should</b> be controlled <b>by</b> the preventive measures and physical regulation. The most important species in Kalnik forest vegetation is definitely acacia. It is especially important for private forest lands where acacia tree has become very popular because of its characteristics as a fast growing tree species without any special requirements with relation to growth and it gives fast results concerning timber and firewood. Private lots are usually very small and fragmented. There is a growing need for timber, therefore the trees are grown extensively, from stumps and roots. Other woody species still do not pose a serious threat in economical or biological sense. The impact of herbaceous plants differs in various areas. The most problematic issues for the forestersare thick layers of unwanted specieswhich grow in young forest stands or in forests in the phase of restorationwhere these unwanted speciesinvasively compete with autochthonous species. In biological sense, invasive species pose a constant threat not only to domestic vegetation and biodiversity, but also to human health. We should also mention apiculture, a very important and well developed activity on Kalnik. Above mentioned species are very important and interesting for apiculture as a type of rich bee pasturage. Apiculture in this area depends on acacia pasturage and it is one of very important reasons for growing acacia tree. Other tree species are also valuable for bee pasturage, especially late in autumn when there is no other bee pasturage available and they are mostly species which blossom in autumn and represent a valuable source of pollen (Japanese Knotweed, Prickly cucumber  and European goldenrod). Generally speaking, the biggest responsibility for possible consequences of invasive plant species to the vegetation of Kalnik lies on foresters who have to recognize and monitor the appearance of invasive species, especially in state forest lands where they grow and directly influence their composition and state...|$|R
