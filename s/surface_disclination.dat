40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{interaction}} between a <b>surface</b> <b>disclination</b> and a bulk disclination placed symmetrically with respect to it has been considered {{on the basis of the}} continuum theory. It is found that at large distances the bulk disclination is attracted by the <b>surface</b> <b>disclination</b> with a force that is independent of the sign of the former. The force of attraction is found to be nearly the same for bulk disclinations of strength 1 / 2, 1 and 2. The theory appears to qualitatively account for the experimental observations of Kléman and Williams...|$|E
40|$|A topological {{study of}} the {{symmetry}} transformations on a surface inducing both tilted and homogeneous orientation in nematic liquid crystals is presented. It predicts the existence of two types of <b>surface</b> <b>disclination</b> lines, which have been observed experimentally. The evaluation of their strength (which does not satisfy the rule S = k × 1 / 2 where k is an integer) required a special definition of this quantity. Their relative positions and interactions are well interpreted in terms of grain boundaries on the surface considered as an ordered two-dimensional medium. The evaluation of the elastic energies of those lines can only be very approximate, due to our ignorance of the anchoring energies...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDisclinations in nematic liquid {{crystals}} usually adopt {{a straight}} shape {{in order to}} minimize their elastic energy. Once created {{in the course of a}} nonequilibrium process such as a temperature quench from the isotropic to the nematic phase, the topologically stable disclinations of half-integer strength either annihilate each other in pairs of opposite strength or form topologically unstable disclinations of integer strength. In this article, we demonstrate that the annihilation process can be inhibited and the defects can be deformed by an applied electric field. We study the disclination lines in the deep uniaxial nematic phase, located at the boundary between two different types of walls, the so-called π wall (a planar soliton stabilized by the surface anchoring) and the Brochard-Léger (BL) wall stabilized by the applied electric field. By changing the electric voltage, one can control the energy of director deformations associated with the two walls and thus control the deformation and dynamics of the disclination line. At small voltages, the disclinations are straight lines connecting the opposite plates of the cell, located at the two ends of the π walls. The π walls tend to shrink. When the voltage increases above EF, the Fréedericksz threshold, the BL walls appear and connect pairs of disclinations along a path complementary to the π wall. At E> 2 EF, the BL walls store sufficient energy to prevent shrinking of the π walls. Reconstruction of the three-dimensional director configuration using a fluorescent confocal polarizing microscopy demonstrates that the disclinations are strongly bent in the region between the π and the BL walls. The distortions and the related dynamics are associated with the transformation of the BL wall into two <b>surface</b> <b>disclination</b> lines; we characterize it experimentally as a function of the applied electric field, the cell thickness, and the sample temperature. A simple model captures the essential details of the experimental data...|$|E
40|$|We {{extend the}} Ericksen–Leslie theory for nematic liquid {{crystals}} {{to account for}} the presence of disclinations. To achieve this, we use Gurtin’s theory of configurational forces and obtain an evolution equation in which the resultant of the Eshelby stress at a disclination is proportional to the velocity of the disclination with respect to the material. Included among our results is a resolution of Eshelby’s paradox concerning the nature of the force acting on a disclination. As an application, we show how <b>surface</b> <b>disclinations</b> can be described using our theory, and how these defects act to curve the free surface of the fluid, in competition with surface tension, and, thus, to create cusps at the surface...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that in nematic liquid {{crystals}} the disclinations which {{are attached to}} the external boundaries of the specimens can be described by a Peierls-Nabarro type model known from the theory of crystal dislocations. Mathematically, dislocations with planar cores and <b>surface</b> <b>disclinations</b> are then completely analogous if the isotropic one-constant approximation and a planar distribution of the director are assumed. Solutions are first given for disclinations in a half-cylinder of large radius and the possibility of an asymmetry in the distribution of the director on the surfaces, which may be caused by an asymmetry in the anchoring forces, is discussed. Disclinations confined to one of the surfaces of a thin nematic layer are also studied. It is shown that the boundary conditions on the other surface may introduce an asymmetry into the distribution of the director in the bulk of the specimen. This long-range asymmetry should be distinguished from the intrinsic, short range asymmetry...|$|R
40|$|A self-consisting gauge-theory {{approach}} to describe Dirac fermions on flexible <b>surfaces</b> with a <b>disclination</b> is formulated. The elastic surfaces are considered as embeddings into R^ 3 and a disclination is incorporated through a topologically nontrivial gauge {{field of the}} local SO(3) group which generates the metric with conical singularity. A smoothing of the conical singularity on flexible surfaces is naturally accounted for by regarding {{the upper half of}} two-sheet hyperboloid as an elasticity-induced embedding. The availability of the zero-mode solution to the Dirac equation is analyzed. Comment: 6 page...|$|R
40|$|We study {{two-dimensional}} equilibrium {{configurations of}} nematic liquid crystal (NLC) director {{in a cell}} confined between two parallel surfaces: a planar surface and a spatially modulated one. The relief of the modulated surface is described by a smooth periodic sine-like function. The director easy axis orientation is homeotropic {{at one of the}} bounding surfaces and is planar at the other one. Strong NLC anchoring with both surfaces is assumed. We consider the case where disclination lines occur in the bulk of NLC strictly above local extrema of the modulated <b>surface.</b> These <b>disclination</b> lines run along the crests and troughs of the relief waves. In the approximation of planar director deformations we obtain analytical expressions describing a director distribution in the bulk of the cell. Equilibrium distances from disclination lines to the modulated surface are calculated and their dependences on the cell thickness and the period and depth of the surface relief are studied. It is shown that the distances from disclination lines to the modulated surface decrease as the depth of the relief increases. Comment: 11 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{general theory of}} liquid {{crystals}} under inhomogeneous electric field in a Ginzburg-Landau scheme. The molecular orientation can be deformed by electric field when the dielectric tensor is orientation-dependent. We then investigate {{the influence of a}} charged particle on the orientation order in a nematic state. The director is aligned either along or perpendicular to the local electric field around the charge, depending on the sign of the dielectric anisotropy. The deformation becomes stronger with increasing the ratio $Ze/R$, where $Ze$ is the charge and $R$ is the radius of the particle. Numerical analysis shows the presence of defects around the particle for large $Ze/R$. They are nanometer-scale defects for microscopic ions. If the dielectric anisotropy is positive, a Saturn ring defect appears. If it is negative, a pair of point defects appear apart from the particle surface, each being connected to the <b>surface</b> by a <b>disclination</b> line segment. Comment: 12 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{scattering}} of a spinless charged particle constrained {{to move on}} a curved surface {{in the presence of}} the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) potential is studied. The particle is confined on the surface using a thin-layer procedure, which gives rise to the well-known geometric potential. We begin with the equations of motion for the surface and transverse dynamics obtained in Ref. Phys. Rev. Lett. 100 (2008) 230403 and make a connection with the description of continuous distribution of dislocations and disclinations theories. In this description, the particle is bounded to a <b>surface</b> with a <b>disclination</b> located in the r= 0 region. We consider the metric tensor that allows us to study the dynamics on the surface of a cone or an anti-cone. By enabling us to study the scattering problem, we chose to study the dynamics of the cone. Expressions for the modified phase shift, scattering operator and the scattering amplitude are determined by applying appropriate boundary conditions at the origin, based on the self-adjoint extension method. Finally, we find that the dependence of the scattering amplitude with energy is only due to the effects of curvature. Comment: 7 page...|$|R
