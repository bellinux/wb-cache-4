40|$|The {{distribution}} of the average north-south magnetic field component Bz {{in the vicinity of}} the neutral sheet has been investigated. This component is crucial for mappings between the nightside polar ionosphere and the equatorial magnetosphere. Data sets consisting of about 0. 5 R(E) averages of magnetic field observations by the IMP/HEOS and ISEE spacecraft have been compared to the field predicted by the Tsyganenko (1987, 1989) models T 87 and T 89. It was found that both T 87 and T 89 underestimate Bz in the near tail region by as much as a factor of 2. Modified versions of the T 87 model, incorporating plasma <b>sheet</b> <b>warping,</b> were obtained by fitting the model parameters via nonlinear least squares to the ISEE data set and yielded Bz values in agreement with the ISEE data. The study reveals an enormous scatter among the observed baseline values of Bz (on a time scale of 10 - 20 min), as well as intrinsic biases imposed by the mathematical structure of tail models, and these two factors (especially the first one) greatly limit the accuracy of model predictions of tail Bz...|$|E

40|$|Using {{ab initio}} plane wave pseudopotential calculations, we study the {{energetics}} {{and structure of}} adsorbed linear arrays of oxygen and aziridine on carbon nanotubes, graphitic ribbons, and graphene sheets. Chemisorption of arrays of O or NH causes splitting of the CC bond and local deformation of the graphitic structures. The (3, 3) nanotube cross section assumes a teardrop-like shape, while graphene <b>sheets</b> <b>warp</b> into a new local geometry around the chemisorbed molecules. The interior of a (3, 3) nanotube is less prone to oxidation than the exterior because of steric effects. A zigzag (6, 0) nanotube is less reactive and thus chemically more stable than an armchair (3, 3) nanotube. The results suggest a partial explanation for the experimentally observed selective etching of metallic carbon nanotubes. I...|$|R

40|$|Handwriting {{recognition}} {{is difficult because}} of the high variability of handwriting and because of segmentation errors. We propose an approach that reduces this variability without requiring letter segmentation. We build an ink extrema classifier which labels local minima of ink as {bottom, baseline, other} and maxima as {midline, top, other}. Despite the high variability of ink, the classifier is 86 % accurate (with 0 % rejection). We use the classifier information to normalize the ink. This is done by applying a “rubber <b>sheet</b> ” <b>warping</b> followed by a “rubber rod ” warping. Both warpings are computed using conjugate gradient methods. We display the normalization results on a few examples. This paper illustrates the pitfalls of ink normalization and “beautification”, when solved independently of letter recognition. 1...|$|R

Based on elastic plate theory, we identify scaling laws for the amplitude and penetration depth of edge ripples as a function of wavelength. We also demonstrate that edge stresses can lead to twisting and scrolling of nanoribbons as seen in experiments.

40|$|Magnetic field {{measurements}} {{made by the}} vector helium magnetometers on board Pioneers- 10 and 11 reveal {{the existence of a}} current sheet (thickness of about 2 Jupiter radii) carrying an eastward current. Self-consistent studies of the current sheet show that the magnitude of the current is of the order of 0. 01 /Am and that the current is carried by a hot (T greater than 1 keV) plasma, the density of which varies between 1 cu cm at 30 Jupiter radii to 100 cu cm at 80 Jupiter radii. The current <b>sheet</b> is <b>warped</b> azimuthally and parallel to the magnetic dipole equator. The existence of an azimuthal field component indicates a poloidal plasma flow transporting some 10 to the 29 th ions per second from Jupiter into the outer magnetosphere. It is shown that, if the outer magnetosphere is in a steady state, this plasma must be transported outward within the current sheet by a diffusion process which is faster than the one responsible for particle transport in the inner magnetosphere but slower than Bohm diffusion...|$|R

40|$|Data {{obtained}} by the Pioneer 10 vector helium magnetometer are presented along with models of the intrinsic magnetic field of Jupiter and its magnetosphere. Data acquired between 2. 84 and 6. 0 Jupiter radii, where {{the intensity of the}} planetary field ranged between 1900 and 18, 400 gamma, were used to develop a six-parameter eccentric dipole model of the field. The dipole so derived has a moment of 4. 0 G (R sub J) cubed and a tilt angle with respect to Jupiter's rotation axis of 11 deg. A model of the Jovian magnetosphere is presented in which the essential feature is an eastward current sheet that forms an annulus with Jupiter at the center. At large distances from the planet the current sheet is nearly parallel to Jupiter's equator but, in general, does not lie in it. The current <b>sheet</b> is <b>warped,</b> so that it is above the equator on one side and below it on the other.

Niedner and Brandt (1978, 1979) have concluded that the plasma tail frequently disconnects from the cometary head, and that these disconnection events (DEs) are produced by magnetic reconnection at sector boundary passages. They proposed that the disconnections are a natural combination of Alfven's model and the solar-wind sector structure first discovered by Wilcox and Ness (1965). The DEs can be utilized as probes of interplanetary sector structure. Correlations between DEs and sector boundaries observed at earth are considered, and sector boundary properties deduced from DEs are discussed.

40|$|A tilt-dependent {{magnetic}} field {{model of the}} Earth's magnetosphere with variable magnetopause standoff distance is presented. Flexible analytic representations for the ring and cross-tail currents, each composed of the elements derived from the Tsyganenko and Usmanov (1982) model, are combined with the fully shielded vacuum dipole configurations of Voigt (1981). Although the current <b>sheet</b> does not <b>warp</b> in the y-z plane, changes in the shape and position of the neutral sheet with dipole tilt are consistent with both MHD equilibrium theory and observations. In addition, there is good agreement with observed Delta B profiles and the average equatorial contours of {{magnetic field}} magnitude. While the dipole field is rigorously shielded within the defined magnetopause, the ring and cross-tails currents are not similarly confined, consequently, the model's region of validity {{is limited to the}} inner magnetosphere. The model depends on four independent external parameters. We present a simple but limited method of simulating several substorm related magnetic field changes associated with the disrupion of the near-Earth cross-tail current sheet and collapse of the midnight magnetotail field region. This feature further facilitates the generation of magnetic field configuration time sequences useful in plasma convection simulations of real magnetospheric events...|$|R

40|$|The Sun's open {{magnetic}} field, {{magnetic flux}} dragged {{out into the}} heliosphere by the solar wind, varies by approximately a factor of 2 over the solar cycle. We consider the evolution of open solar flux {{in terms of a}} source and loss term. Open solar flux creation is likely to proceed at a rate dependent on the rate of photospheric flux emergence, which can be roughly parameterized by sunspot number or coronal mass ejection rate, when available. The open solar flux loss term is more difficult to relate to an observable parameter. The supersonic nature of the solar wind means open solar flux can only be removed by near-Sun magnetic reconnection between open solar magnetic field lines, be they open or closed heliospheric field lines. In this study we reconstruct open solar flux over the last three solar cycles and demonstrate that the loss term {{may be related to the}} degree to which the heliospheric current <b>sheet</b> (HCS) is <b>warped,</b> i. e., locally tilted from the solar rotation direction. This can account for both the large dip in open solar flux at the time of sunspot maximum as well as the asymmetry in open solar flux during the rising and declining phases of the solar cycle. The observed cycle-to-cycle variability is also well matched. Following Sheeley et al. (2001), we attribute modulation of open solar flux by the degree of warp of the HCS to the rate at which opposite polarity open solar flux is brought together by differential rotation...|$|R

40|$|The Horoman ultramafic massif, {{covering}} {{more than}} 8 × 10 km in the Hidaka Metamorphic Belt, is an "alpine-type" peridotite {{which is a}} gently <b>warped</b> <b>sheet</b> about 3, 000 m in thickness. The massif exhibits a conspicuous layered structure which consists of layers of dunite, lherzolite, plagioclase lherzolite, and {{a small amount of}} gabbro and pyroxenite. Coexisting minerals from all the rock types of the layered ultramafic to mafic sequence were analysed by EPMA. The ferromagnesian minerals show large compositional variations in accordance with lithological change in the series of dunite → lherzolite → plagioclase lherzolite → gabbro. Forsterite content of olivine varies successively from Fo 92. 5 to Fo 64. 5. Enstatite content of orthopyroxene also varies from En 93. 0 to En 85. 5. Large and continuous compositional variation was also obtained for clinopyroxenes, e. g. Ca 46 Mg 51 Fe 3 from dunite, Ca 48 Mg 48 Fe 4 from lherzolite, Ca 49 Mg 46 Fe 5 from plagioclase lherzolite, Ca 50 Mg 44 Fe 6 from the margin of gabbro, and Ca 38 Mg 39 Fe 23 from the center of gabbro. Al and Ti contents of clinopyroxcncs and pargasitic amphiboles increase with decrease of the Mg/ Mg + Fe ratio. The mineralogical characteristics indicate that the Horoman layered sequence represents a magmatic series formed by fractional crystallization. The gabbroic seams in the plagioclase lherzolite and the layers of gabbro were probably formed by crystallization of residual liquid which were slightly alkaline in chemical nature. The Horoman ultramafic rocks are strongly modified by deep-seated deformation and recrystallization, and additionally by mylonitization during the up-thrusting intrusion into the Earth's crust. The primary composition of minerals, obtained by step-scanning EPMA analyses are recognized as a distinct and uniform compositional plateaus at the cores of large, porphyroclastic, primary grains. The equilibration temperatures were calculated for the orthopyroxene-clinopyroxene pairs of primary porphyroclasts, using the Opx-Cpx geothermometer. The temperatures range from 900 ℃ to 1, 100 ℃. The estimates for the neoblastic pyroxene pairs are slightly lower, ranging between 850 ℃ and 1, 000 ℃. The rocks might have re-equilibrated under the subsolidus conditions in the upper mantle...|$|R

A novel method of shaping sheet glass is presented. This method reduces the surface waviness of a glass sheet and changes its shape while it is in its hot state and without contacting its surface. A sheet of glass is inserted between two parallel porous mandrels such that it is at a predefined distance from the two. A thin layer of pressurized gas flows through each mandrel and out against the glass surfaces. The resulting viscous flow against the heated soft glass sheet changes its surface topography. By using flat mandrels and controlled pressurized gas at temperatures close to 600 °C, the outcome is a flat sheet of glass with its original immaculate optical qualities. The flow in porous mandrels and the resulting pressure distribution along the surfaces of a glass sheet inserted between two porous mandrels is modeled. The design and manufacturing of an apparatus used to reduce the surface waviness of glass sheets at elevated temperatures is described. (cont.) The apparatus designed addresses individual sheets; however, guidelines on how to incorporate this method of shaping glass in a continuous glass sheet manufacturing facility are provided. A method of rigidly assembling stacks of glass and silicon sheets with precision for x-ray telescope mirrors and gratings is also presented. by Mireille Akilian. Thesis (Ph. D.)
