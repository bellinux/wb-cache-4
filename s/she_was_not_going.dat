5|$|After {{her return}} to London in early 1937, {{recognising}} that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> {{to be a success}} on the stage David abandoned thoughts of a theatrical career. Later in the year she took a post as a junior assistant at the fashion house of Worth, where smart young women from upper class backgrounds were sought after as recruits. She found the subservience of retail work irksome, and resigned in early 1938. Over the next few months she spent time holidaying in the south of France and on Corsica, where she was greatly taken with the outgoing nature of the people she stayed with and the simple excellence of their food. After returning to London, and disenchanted with life there, she joined Cowan in buying a boat, just big enough to suffice, with the intention of sailing it to Greece. They crossed the Channel in July 1939 and navigated the boat through the canal system of France to the Mediterranean coast.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} {{plans for the}} series, Jack {{was going to die}} midway through the first episode. The role of Jack was {{originally}} offered to Michael Keaton, but when the producers quickly changed their minds about Jack's death, making him the leader, Keaton gave up the job. After Matthew Fox's casting as Jack, the character was established as a leader, and the airplane pilot was introduced to take Jack's place as The Monster's first victim. The pilot wound up being played by Greg Grunberg, a childhood friend of Abrams who the producer brings into most of his projects. Around seventy-five women of different shapes, sizes, ethnicities and ages auditioned to be Kate. In the initial plans, Kate would emerge as the leader after Jack died. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to be a fugitive, instead her husband {{was going to go to}} the bathroom shortly before the plane split in mid air, and she would remain adamant on the Island that he was alive. This ended up being used for Rose's (L. Scott Caldwell) character instead. The producers were impressed with Canadian Evangeline Lilly's audition for Kate, as she displayed the confidence with vulnerability that they were looking for. As this was Lilly's first role, she had difficulty obtaining a visa to work in America. She was supposed to start on the first day of filming, but the schedule was rearranged to give her more time, and in the meantime, the producers began auditioning again in case the visa did not come through. However, during one of the auditions, they got an email confirming that she had obtained her visa and could start work on the show.|$|E
25|$|The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office prosecuted Simpson for {{the killings}} of Goldman and Simpson's ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, {{based on the}} theory that Simpson, who had had a history of {{domestic}} violence with her, had acted in a fit of rage upon realizing that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to return to him. Simpson himself, according to his lawyers, believed that the two had been killed over their involvement in drug dealing in the area, and that other murders at the time were carried out for the same reason. Brown, her former husband believed, had been planning to open a restaurant of her own using proceeds from cocaine sales. Mezzaluna Trattoria, where she ate her last meal, and where both Nigg and Goldman had worked, was reportedly a nexus for drug trafficking in Brentwood.|$|E

500|$|After {{releasing}} the book, John Lennon, My Brother—written with Giuliano, and a foreword by McCartney—Baird travelled to New York during 1989 {{to appear at}} a Beatlefest convention, and was {{asked if she could}} prove she was really Lennon's half-sister. Baird declined, saying <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to produce her passport, and the audience would just have to take her word for it. In 2000, Baird was present at the unveiling of six road signs, erected on major routes into Liverpool, saying, [...] "Liverpool welcomes you – to the birthplace of THE BEATLES", and in October she planted a tree in Liverpool's Peace Gardens to commemorate Lennon's birthday.|$|E
500|$|On {{the morning}} of Friday 19 May, Anne Boleyn was {{executed}} within the Tower precincts, not upon {{the site of the}} execution memorial, but rather, according to historian Eric Ives, on a scaffold erected {{on the north side of}} the White Tower, in front of what is now the Waterloo Barracks. She wore a red petticoat under a loose, dark grey gown of damask trimmed in fur and a mantle of ermine. Accompanied by two female attendants, Anne made her final walk from the Queen's House to the scaffold and she showed a [...] "devilish spirit" [...] and looked [...] "as gay as if <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to die". Anne climbed the scaffold and made a short speech to the crowd: ...|$|E
500|$|However, in an {{interview}} with Hard Knock TV, Hilson denied the claims that the remix was directed at dissing Knowles or Ciara. According to Hilson, Polow da Don gave her the idea to do a [...] "fiery" [...] record. Although she said she was not retracting anything in the song, calling her response a [...] "blanket statement" [...] she said <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to feel some sort of way about how other people interpret, and that blatantly dissing anyone was not the energy behind the record. Hilson commented she wanted to address the haters, and all the media speculation about the remarks was something they did not intend to accomplish with the song. She also addressed that the release of the song was not an intentional leak, stating most remixes are meant to be done when a record is hot, and although admitting that while [...] "Turnin Me On" [...] was not [...] "a number one record", the remix was done three months prior.|$|E

500|$|For the album, Carey {{covered the}} 1982 Journey song [...] "Open Arms". The song was of Carey's {{personal}} choice, {{as well as}} her own idea. Together with Afanasieff, they toned down the song's arrangement, making it a bit glossy, especially in comparison to the [...] "raw and powerful 'One Sweet Day.'" [...] Additionally, {{with the help of her}} background singers, Carey added a touch of gospel to the song. One of the more gospel-influenced songs on the album was [...] "I Am Free". The song was created by Carey, Afanasieff and Loris Holland, with whom she had worked previously on Merry Christmas. Carey began humming the melody with the lyrics she had already written, while Holland played the organ and Afanasieff worked on the song's programming., giving the song a genuine and unforced gospel feel. The chorus was sophisticated and natural, with each following line [...] "cascading onto one another", something that would have proved difficult for a [...] "less skilled vocalist". Carey started leaning away from the [...] "standard Celine Dion ballad" [...] and more towards R jams. However, <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to completely abandon the type of songs that made her famous. For this reason, Carey wrote [...] "When I Saw You" [...] with Afanasieff, a song that would truly embody some of her earlier work, as well as show off her powerful vocals. Returning to her R territory, Carey recorded [...] "Long Ago", the second song she wrote alongside Dupri and Seal which contains a strong hip hop background. Her vocals in the song were described as [...] "sliding over the insistent bassline like silk." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alaina Alexander [...] (born July 21, 1982) auditioned in Los Angeles. She is from West Hollywood, California. Before her American Idol 6 audition, Alexander {{revealed}} that after struggling {{for six years}} {{to make it in}} the music business in Los Angeles she had decided <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to sing anymore and had decided to go to college instead. [...] She considered American Idol to be her last chance to pursue a singing career. For her Los Angeles audition, [...] Alexander sang [...] "Feeling Good" [...] by Michael Bublé.|$|E
2500|$|After [...] "It All Belongs to Me" [...] was {{presented}} to Monica, the singer revealed {{that she wanted to}} record a duet with Brandy, following their first released in 1998. Brandy also had plans to record a new duet with Monica. After talking to RCA and Chameleon Records executives Peter Edge and Breyon Prescott, both singers agreed to record the song. Monica, however, stated that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to the studio without Clive Davis' permission. Brandy's team then contacted Davis, who authorized the duet. Brandy and Monica then recorded the song together in a recording studio located on Miami, Florida from January 6 to 8, 2012. Brandy said that the energy of the recording sessions was [...] "magical! I was just so excited to see her again, just to work with her again. The session was great. It was like it was meant to be. It was like we never missed a beat." [...] The singers also took pictures and talked about their current lives. Brandy also revealed that she and Monica wanted to [...] "give [...] best vocals ever on a song." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{was with}} her when she died. She left this world {{literally}} screaming {{at the top of her}} lungs. I {{was with her}} constantly, she lived not even 3 miles from my house, we were together practically every day. She was home for the last few weeks when the doctor told us there was nothing they could do any more. Up until the last two days, she was still moving around. The doctor told us she will leave very quickly and her body will just start to shut down. But when she left, she left the world with a bang, she left it how she lived it. She screamed her way out of here, literally. I truly believe her survival instincts were so part of her DNA that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to go quietly or willingly. It was just the two of us hanging out [...] she was very funny. We didn't have to [...] because I always knew how she felt about me. I was the love of her life, so the last part of her life we didn't have to have these heart to heart talks.|$|E
2500|$|Most of {{the editors}} of FIRE!! also contributed to Harlem. [...] They also {{approached}} other writers. [...] One such was Nella Larsen, a friend of Peterson. [...] Peterson had wanted no part in another magazine published by Thurman, and had been approached by Nugent and Scholley Alexander, to write a monthly theatrical column, under the pretext that Alexander was the editor. [...] Upon receiving a thank-you letter with Thurman's name as editor on the letterhead, she withdrew, despite pleas from Alexander acknowledging Thurman's [...] "selfish treatment {{of those who have}} helped him gain a place in the literary world" [...] and stating that he would not let Thurman run amok. [...] Alexander asked Peterson to ask her friends [...] "to forbear [...] to with-hold their criticism until they have the first issue at hand to criticize" [...] (original emphasis and underlining). [...] Larsen also declined, on the grounds that <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to be paid for her submissions, confessing that her ultimate goal in writing was [...] "money". [...] "I write so slowly and with such great reluctance that it seems a waste of time.", she also observed.|$|E
6000|$|Why {{should she}} give her {{allegiance}} to this world, {{and let it}} so dominate her, that her own world of warm sun and growing, sap-filled life was turned into nothing? <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to do it. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to be a prisoner in the dry, tyrannical man-world. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to care about it.
