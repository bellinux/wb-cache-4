The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the temperature at which degreening begins naturally in Verna lemon, noting the evo-lution of colorimetric parameter a and comparing the same with the equivalent measurements made in Eureka lemon, the most widely cultivated lemon worldwide. The influence of solar radiation on the colorimetric parameters in Verna was studied, and the influence of the minimum temperatures on the change from green to yellow, using the data collected over five growing seasons, was assessed. The results confirmed the relation between net solar radiation and degreening, a process that begins when net solar radiation reaches a value of between 2 and 4 MJ/m 2. day and when the mean temperature of the 14 days prior to sampling is 8. 8 °C or when the daily mean temperature reaches 5. 5 °C on two consecutive days.

I t shows that developments in this field are continuing and that specialisation of the transport chain {{in general and of}} ships in particular, frequently follow once bulking techniques are proved. It investigates the behaviour of the specialised charter markets and shows that there are many of these. I t demonstrates that they each have their own individual characteristics but that there is some interplay between them. The types of contract available, the preferences of charterers and the various contractual advantages and disadvantages are shown. Shipping is a highly cyclical industry and the effects of this are illustrated. Due to high capital intensity, shipowners wishing to <b>supply</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> with specialised tonnage are forced to raise finance from outside sources. There are a number of ways in which this can be done. These are set out and the rationale behind funding structures is discussed. Throughout the work, due cognisance is taken of the fact that in 1979 shipping is going through its biggest crisis of the twentieth century. This accentuates the problems of the shipowner and his source of finance alike. This situation demands new approaches in order that specialised shipping continues to be supplied, frequently on the strength of market expectations- The methods used to achieve this are shown. The final chapter presents a full assessment of the situation together with the conclusions drawn {{as a result of the}} research- Appropriate tables, figures and appendices are included to ensure a complete structure. The contribution to knowledge is made particularly with respect to the structure and behaviour of specialised ship charter markets and the financial packages which evolve to give the supply of ships to meet market demand...|$|E
40|$|Product {{development}} is a risky business; many products never yield profit, {{but it is also}} ne-cessary for a company’s survival in a competitive business where the costumers change their requests constantly. Consumer-led product {{development is}} developed from the wish to fill the consumer’s needs and expectations and thereby be more likely to succeed. Lindell’s Gårdsslakteri AB is a local slaughter and meat processor in Västergötland. They wish to ex-pand their meat product assortment with a new product that fits into their otherwise traditional and quality oriented <b>supply.</b> <b>A</b> <b>market</b> survey led into the idea of developing a fermented sausage. The manufacturing of fermented sausage is complex with many parameters to consider producing a tasteful, visually attractive and safe sausage. Typical for all fermented sausages are the combination of lactic acid, salting and drying. A "medvurst" is a type of fast fermented sausage that is produced and ready to be sold within a few days. The manufacturing process started with the mixing of pork and beef meat with seasonings, starter culture and curing salt. When a paste was formed frozen pork fat was mixed in. After filling into semipermeable casings the sausage was left for tempering. The fermentation started in the smoke chamber followed by smoking and heat treatment to 47 °C. The sausage was then left in the chilling room to mature for 2 days. After two test trials the desired sausage was created. Following was the labeling and part of a risk analysis concerning EHEC. After the end of the project Lindell´s continued with the risk analysis, durability tests and launching. The resulting product is a locally produced "medvurst". Consumer’s interest in extrinsic factors has created a whole new market with many new possibilities for product development. Meat product in-gredients have gained an extra interest from the consumers {{in the last couple of}} years, espe-cially the additives. Lindell´s like many other companies are getting more questions and phone calls about this and a deepened knowledge is desired to be able to fill the consumer needs...|$|E
40|$|In {{resource}} based economies, {{regulating the}} production and export activities have always been an important challenge. Examples in oil and gas show that different behaviors have been adopted ranging from the export monopoly to the complete opening of the export market. This paper tries to explain this multitude of solutions via strategic interactions. When modeling imperfect competition, players are separated in two categories: those who exert market power {{and those who are}} competitive and propose the good at their marginal supply cost. Letting a player freely choose whether it wants to exert market power or not when it optimizes its utility is not discussed in the literature. This paper addresses this issue by letting the players choose the level of competition they want to exert in the market. To do so, we analyze the behavior of two countries competing to <b>supply</b> <b>a</b> <b>market</b> with a homogeneous good in an imperfect competition setting. Each country decides the number of firms it authorizes to sell in the market. The interaction between the firms is of a Nash-Cournot type, where each one exerts market power and is in competition with all other firms allowed to sell, whether they belong to the same country or not. Each country optimizes its utility, that is the sum of the profits of its firms. We have studied four kinds of interaction between the countries. The first calculates the closed loop Nash equilibrium of the game between the countries. The second setup analyzes the cartel when the countries collude. The third focuses on the open loop Nash equilibrium and the fourth models a bi-level Stackelberg interaction where one country plays before the other. We demonstrate that in the closed loop Nash equilibrium, our setting leads to the prisoner’s dilemma: the equilibrium occurs when both countries authorize all their firms to sell in the market. In other words, countries willingly chose not to exert market power. This result is at first sight similar to the Allaz & Vila (1993) result but is driven by a completely different economic reasoning. In the Stackelberg and coordinated solutions, the market is on the contrary very concentrated and the countries strongly reduce the number of firms that enter the market in order to fully exert market power and increase the price. The open loop result lies in between: the countries let all their firms sell but market power remains strong. These results suggest that the prisoner’s dilemma outcome is due to the conjectural inconsistency of the Nash equilibrium. Finally, in the Stackelberg setting, we give countries the choice of being leader or follower and demonstrate that the counter-intuitive competitive outcome is very unlikely to occur in the market...|$|E

40|$|The oil-producing {{trees of}} the Sahel was the theme which drew 30 specialists to Bamako, Mali, in duly 1992 for a meeting {{organized}} by the French Ministry of Cooperation and Development. The aim was to decide which species could be marketed, and what research remained to be done. The shea butter tree, the physic nut tree, balanites, argan, neem, moringa are all Sahelian trees which produce a top-quality oil and flourish on poor, stony soil in areas of minimal rainfall. Africans have long {{been aware of the}} properties of these oils, from which the women make butter, cosmetic creams, cooking oils, insecticides and medicines. Across the Sahel the women gather in the nuts, roast or dry them in the sun, then pound and mix them for hours. Part of the oil extracted is for family consumption, and the rest is sold for cash. Multi-use species New uses for these tropical trees are being constantly discovered. Shea butter is used in the treatment of bronchitis and heals sprains and burns; neem kills insect pests; moringa seeds have properties which clarify muddy or cloudy water; balanites oil has amazing cosmetic properties; and oil from the physic nut can be used as engine fuel. The plants, however, are irregular in their growing and fruiting cycles: for example, the shea butter tree fruits only every two to three years, and the argan tree will grow only in the wild. In order to see which of the products of these plants could be marketed and what further research was called for, the French Ministry of Cooperation and Development organized a gathering of 30 experts on oil seed trees in the Sahelian regions. The meeting, called Oleasylva, was held in Bamako Mali in July 1992. At this meeting the delegates explored the concept of marketing, which was new to most of them. The organizer, Arthur Riedacker, sees signs of a new direction 'We have to adopt an entirely new approach at this meeting. Previously, we geared our research to one particular tree and then looked at how we might increase production, but now we must first find out whether it is marketable or not. If the answer is 'yes', then research can get under way. ' The gathering was attended by 30 delegates among whom 15 were African from 1 countries. Technicians, manufacturers, dealers, chemists and end-users were present One problem which occupied much of the time was that of processing kernels. '`The reason we are here is to decide on the action we are going to take, and to find the an swers to our questions from the facts at our disposal,' said Professor Dan Dicker, Director of the CRES (a regional centre for solar energy), who was hosting the work shop. Various views were exchanged among delegates: for example, Hieke Osterman, a neem specialist, suggested that leaving some of the neem shell mixed with the kernel in the press increases the pressure and allows more oil to be extracted. Many problems remain unsolved The processing is a mammoth task, requiring eight hours of manual labour to extract one litre of shea butter oil, and ten hours for one litre of argan oil. These domestic production techniques cannot keep up with current requirements and neither can the productivity of the trees themselves. Balanites and neem only bear fruit after rainfall and the unpredictability of the weather makes it extremely hard to have any confidence in the ability to <b>supply</b> <b>a</b> <b>market.</b> Furthermore, if processing is not carried out correctly the oils quickly go rancid and smell disgusting. There are also difficulties at pressing because some seeds contain a substance which blocks the filters, or because the shell does not come away from the kernel. Unhelpful legislation On the international market, especially in Europe, legislation causes difficulties. `'At present shea butter is banned in the manufacture of chocolate in most European countries,' explains Jean-Jacques Pesquet of APROMA (a French association for the promotion of raw materials). 'It can be used only for coating, and cocoa is used in preference because of its quality. Up till now this ban has been violated by many manufacturers because shea butter is much cheaper than cocoa. But that is no longer the case, and it is pointless continuing the fraud. ' Today 97 % of shea butter exports are used in the food manufacturing industry. The question now is whether legislation will change in the near future, or whether the brokers will direct these products towards the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries instead. 'We have to act quickly,' urges Arthur Riedacker; 'the chemical industry can substitute synthetic products for these natural ones, and it is far harder to halt the use of a substance once in production than to get it adopted. ' But neither the market nor the desert can wait for long. The organizer of the workshop, which was held as part of the 'Observatoire du Sahara et du Sahel' projects, reminded those present; 'the only way to stop desertification is to protect the vegetation.
