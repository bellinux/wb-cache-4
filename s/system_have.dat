The first exocomet system detected was around Beta Pictoris, a very young A-type main-sequence star, in 1987.

40|$|Abstract：For {{reduction}} {{of the amount of}} CO 2 emitted from ships, power generation characteristics of two power generation systems consisting of a high-efficiency permanent magnet synchronous generator and diode bridge rictifiers are discussed in this paper. One of the discussed <b>systems</b> <b>has</b> three-phase stator windings, and the other has two sets of three-phase (six-phase) stator windings to reduce pulsation in the electromagnetic torque and DC current. Experimental results reveal that the power generation efficiency of the <b>system</b> <b>having</b> six-phase stator windings is higher than that of the <b>system</b> <b>having</b> three-phase stator windings for a light load. The maximum power generation efficiency of the <b>system</b> <b>having</b> six-phase stator windings is almost {{the same as that of}} the <b>system</b> <b>having</b> three-phase stator windings.

5|$|The {{construction}} of large dams, {{especially in the}} mid and {{upper reaches of the}} <b>system</b> <b>have</b> significantly affected the ability of fish to migrate up and down the river, and into the Sea of Japan. There has also been {{a significant increase in the}} amount of fishing which takes place in the system which is associated with the introduction of invasive fish species and waterbirds into the system. The development of the river, and human settlement, has also resulted in the environmental degradation of key fish habitat. Changes in the <b>system</b> <b>have</b> affected its ability to support and maintain fish species which are endemic to the river. Some actions have been taken to overcome these issues, including prohibitions on fishing salmon during breeding and stocking certain areas for fishing, especially in areas where Tsukeba fish shacks (popup stores along the riverbank) are regularly set up.|$|E

Also in October 2011, the MTA announced a pilot program aimed at reducing levels of garbage in the subways by removing all garbage bins from the subway platforms. The initiative is being tested at the Eighth Street–New York University and Flushing–Main Street stations.

5|$|Flights from Earth {{to other}} planets in the Solar <b>System</b> <b>have</b> a high energy cost. It {{requires}} {{almost the same}} amount of energy for a spacecraft to reach Jupiter from Earth's orbit as it does to lift it into orbit in the first place. In astrodynamics, this energy expenditure is defined by the net change in the spacecraft's velocity, or delta-v. The energy needed to reach Jupiter from an Earth orbit requires a delta-v of about 9km/s, compared to the 9.0–9.5km/s to reach a low Earth orbit from the ground. Gravity assists through planetary flybys (such as by Earth or Venus) can be used to reduce the energetic requirement (i.e. the fuel) at launch, at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration to reach a target such as Jupiter when compared to the direct trajectory. Ion thrusters capable of a delta-v of more than 10 kilometers/s were used on the Dawn spacecraft. This is more than enough delta-v to do a Jupiter fly-by mission from a solar orbit of the same radius as that of Earth without gravity assist.|$|E

The Grorud and Lambertseter Lines serve the Groruddalen valley while the Østensjø and Lambertseter Line serve the southern areas of Nordstrand. These four lines have the highest ridership. In the west, the Kolsås, Røa, Holmenkoll and Sognsvann Lines serves less densely populated areas. The Ring Line serves the northern borough of Nordre Aker, while the Common Tunnel serves the city center.|$|E
