40|$|Abstract: This study {{presents}} the optimization design process of a <b>segment</b> ball <b>valve</b> {{that involves the}} reduction of the flow resistance coefficient and the satisfaction of the strength requirement. Numerical analysis of fluid flow and structural analysis have been performed to predict the flow resistance coefficient and the maximum stress of a <b>segment</b> ball <b>valve.</b> In this study, a <b>segment</b> ball <b>valve</b> incorporating the advantages of a ball valve and a butterfly valve has been devised. In general, ball valves are installed in a pipe system where tight shut off is required. Butterfly valves having smaller end-to-end dimension than ball valve can be installed in narrow spaces in a pipe system. The metamodels for the shape design of a <b>segment</b> ball <b>valve</b> are built by the response surface method and the Kriging interpolation model...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{the design of a}} <b>valve</b> <b>segment</b> for the Helios hybrid rocket engine, built by ExperimentalRaumfahrt-InteressenGemeinschaft e. V. (ERIG) for the Leonis project in {{cooperation}} with Institute of Aerospace Systems of Technische Universität Braunschweig. In the Leonis project ERIG will develope a supersonic rocket named Regulus for the Studentische Experimental-Raketen program (STERN), which is initiated by the German Aerospace Center (DLR). Helios is based on a liquid oxidizer and a solid fuel grain. A <b>valve</b> <b>segment</b> is needed to connect the oxidizer vessel with the combustion chamber. This <b>valve</b> <b>segment</b> is responsible for some crucial features of Helios such as regulation of the mass flow from oxidizer vessel to the combustion chamber. Especially because of the high mass flow per second, the requirement for a light design and the integration of several features a new <b>valve</b> <b>segment</b> is designed. Thus different concepts of switching are compared e. g. hybrid, electromagnetical and pyrotechnical. The results of this study and the final design of the <b>valve</b> <b>segment</b> are presented in this paper...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} whether tissue-engineered human allogeneic vein valves have a normal closure time (competency) and tolerate reflux pressure in vitro. MethodsFifteen human allogeneic femoral vein <b>segments</b> containing <b>valves</b> were harvested from cadavers. Valve closure time and resistance to reflux pressure (100  mm Hg) were assessed in an in vitro model to verify competency of the vein <b>valves.</b> The <b>segments</b> were tissue engineered using the technology of decellularization (DC) and recellularization (RC). The decellularized and recellularized vein segments were characterized biochemically, immunohistochemically, and biomechanically. ResultsFour of 15 veins with valves were found to be incompetent immediately after harvest. In total, 2 of 4 <b>segments</b> with incompetent <b>valves</b> and 10 of 11 <b>segments</b> with competent <b>valves</b> were further decellularized using detergents and DNAse. DC resulted in significant decrease in host DNA compared with controls. DC scaffolds, however, retained major extracellular matrix proteins and mechanical integrity. RC resulted in successful repopulation of the lumen and valves of the scaffold with endothelial and smooth muscle cells. Valve mechanical parameters were similar to the native tissue even after DC. Eight of 10 veins with competent valves remained competent even after DC and RC, whereas the two incompetent valves remained incompetent even after DC and RC. The valve closure time to reflux pressure of the tissue-engineered veins was < 0. 5  second. ConclusionsTissue-engineered veins with valves provide a valid template for future preclinical studies and eventual clinical applications. This technique may enable replacement of diseased incompetent or damaged deep veins to treat axial reflux and thus reduce ambulatory venous hypertension. Clinical RelevanceThe use of natural, human scaffolds to produce tissue-engineered venous <b>segments</b> containing functioning <b>valves</b> will revolutionize the surgical correction of deep venous reflux in patients with chronic venous insufficiency and leg ulcer. Reconstructive deep venous surgery in the form of valvuloplasty, transplantation, and neovalve construction has met limitations in the rare availability of valves to be repaired, lack of donor sites, and inadequate conditions to create new valves. This tissue-engineered procedure produces the functioning unit “valve-conduit,” and surgery will be used only to implant it...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveThe study {{objective}} {{was to examine the}} late results of mitral valve repair with chordal replacement with polytetrafluoroethylene sutures. MethodsFrom 1986 to 2004, 606 consecutive patients with degenerative mitral regurgitation had mitral valve repair with chordal replacement with polytetrafluoroethylene sutures. Patients' mean age was 57 years, and 73. 6 % were men. Isolated prolapse of the anterior leaflet was present in 17. 6 % of patients, isolated posterior leaflet prolapse was present in 29. 5 % of patients, and bileaflet prolapse was present in 52. 9 % of patients. Prolapse was corrected by creating 2 to 38 neochords of polytetrafluoroethylene sutures (mean, 13 ± 9 per patient). The mean follow-up was 10. 1 years, and 96 % of the patients had multiple echocardiographic studies over the years. ResultsThere were 5 early and 106 late deaths. Age, diabetes, hypertension, chronic obstructive lung disease, New York Heart Association functional classes III and IV, and ejection fraction less than 40 % were independent predictors of mortality. At 18 years, freedom from reoperation on the mitral valve was 90. 2 % ± 2. 4 %, freedom from recurrent severe mitral regurgitation was 91. 0 % ± 2. 7 %, and freedom from moderate or severe mitral regurgitation was 67. 5 % ± 4. 2 %. Cox regression analysis revealed that isolated prolapse of the anterior leaflet was predictive of reoperation, and that older age, hypertension, and left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40 % were predictive of recurrent moderate or severe mitral regurgitation. ConclusionsChordal replacement with polytetrafluoroethylene sutures expands the indication of repair to patients with prolapse of multiple <b>segments.</b> <b>Valve</b> function remains stable in most patients during the first 2 decades of follow-up...|$|R

60|$|General Appearance.--Capitulum oval, {{more or less}} produced, flat or gibbous; formed of three, five, {{or seven}} {{approximate}} valves; the lesser number arising from the abortion of the terga, and the greater number from the scuta being divided into two <b>segments.</b> <b>Valves</b> moderately thick, either white or reddish, smooth or striated, and sometimes partly covered by membrane, bearing minute spines. Scuta oval, of varying proportions; the basal margin is generally narrow, and blends into the carina-tergal margin; the internal basal rim generally is well developed, sometimes with, and sometimes without internal teeth beneath the umbones. In P. eburnea, and sometimes in P. crassa, there is a line of apparent fissure, and in P. fissa of actual disseverment, running from the umbo to the apex of each scutum, nearly in the line in which a ridge extends in Lepas: the primordial valves of the scuta in these three species, are seated at the basal angles of the lateral and larger segments. The positions of the primordial valves, and the direction {{of growth in the}} calcified valves, are, in all the species, the same as in Lepas. In several of the species attached to Crustacea, the two scuta are unequally convex, which is caused, as was pointed out to me by Mr. Gray, by that valve which lies close and nearly parallel to the body of the crab, being least developed. The Terga are either quite absent, or rudimentary as in P. crassa, or pretty well developed as in the other species: the occludent margin is single, and not double as generally in Lepas; the basal angle is either pointed or truncated. The Carina varies considerably in shape, but never extends up between the terga, nor ends downwards in a fork; in the first two species it is truncated; in the others, it terminates in a deeply-imbedded oblong disc, which in P. eburnea seems almost entirely (but of course not quite) to separate the inside of the capitulum from the peduncle; a similar separation is effected in P. fissa, where the imbedded disc is small, by two large teeth on the internal basal rims of the two scuta. The carina is always narrow, and either solid internally or very slightly concave.|$|R

Design:Prospective cohort study. Materials and methods:In a long term follow-up study the deep venous system of 24 patients (7 men, 17 women, mean age 51 years) of an initial group of 27 with phlebographically documented deep venous thrombosis were examined with Duplex scanning at two intervals (mean 34 and 86 months) after DVT. Results:All but one segments recanalised. Deep venous incompetence occurred exclusively in post-DVT segments. At first follow-up 48 % of the post-thrombotic <b>segments</b> showed <b>valve</b> incompetence, while at second follow-up this had increased to 60 % (p < 0. 001). Venous segments of the upper leg mainly contributed to this increase. Our group of 24 patients was too small to find any significant correlation between symptoms, thrombosis and valvular incompetence. Conclusions:The development of deep vein valve incompetence after deep vein thrombosis is a progressive process over more than 5 years...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{the development of}} a four-part needle prototype inspired by the ovipositor of parasitic wasps. In the wasp ovipositor, three longitudinal <b>segments</b> called <b>valves</b> move reciprocally to gain depth in the substrate. It has been suggested that serrations located along the wasp ovipositor induce a friction difference between moving and anchoring valves that is needed for this reciprocal motion. Such an anchoring mechanism may not be desired in a medical setting, as serrations can induce tissue damage. Our aim was to investigate whether a multipart needle can penetrate tissue phantom material with near-zero net push force while using needle parts devoid of surface gripping textures or serrations. Accordingly, a four-part needle prototype was developed and tested in gelatine substrates. The performance of the prototype was assessed in terms of the degree of slipping of the needle with respect to the gelatine, with less slip implying better performance. Slip decreased with decreasing gelatine concentration and increasing offset between the needle parts. Motion through gelatine was achieved with a maximum push force of 0. 035 N. This study indicates the possibility of needle propagation into a substrate with low net push force and without the need of serrations on the needle surface. </p...|$|R

However, using this machine requires a degree of skill in order to locate the heart valves. We propose the use of a trained neural network to locate the position of the aortic valve from an echocardiogram image as an assistive technology during echocardiogram examination.

After training the AlexNet, it was tested with 25 images and the resulted images were validated with a sonographer. Testing the AlexNet within the deep learning platform showed it was able to achieve an accuracy of 99. 87 % for aortic valve and 99. 69 % for background images. The qualitative comparison from the sonographer with the resulted image was that the trained neural network was able to localize the image accurately but {{may not be able to}} <b>segment</b> the <b>valve</b> precisely.

40|$|A {{detailed}} study of the cuticular structures of the oesophagus, crop, proventriculus, stomodaeal <b>valve,</b> first proctodaeal <b>segment,</b> enteric <b>valve,</b> paunch, colon, rectal valve and rectum of the lower termite genera belonging to the families Mastotermitidae, Kalotermitidae, Termopsidae, Hodotermitidae and Rhinotermitidae has been made. The cuticular structures lining the alimentary canal of termites provide a highly reliable character in identifying termite genera and higher taxa and in establishing their phylo genetic relationships. In some cases {{it is possible to}} identify even species. No single character has hitherto proved as useful as the cuticular ornamentation of the alimentary canal in the generic recognition of termites. The imago worker mandibles used by Ahmad (1950) for study of termite Phylogeny do not show such a wide array of size, shape, type and arrangement as do the cuticular structures of the alimentary canal. While it is possible to identify many genera on the basis of imago-worker mandibles, in some cases, however, only generic grouping can be done using this character (Ahmad, 1950). On the other hand all the genera included in the present study are recognizable {{on the basis of the}} cuticular structures lining the alimentary canal. The comparative study of the cuticular structures present in the oesophagus, crop, proventriculus, first proctodaeal <b>segment,</b> enteric <b>valve</b> and rectal valve shows that the ornamentation in each part of the alimentary canal has its own level of importance in termite taxonomy. The armature of the oesophagus, crop, proventriculus and rectal valve is of value in the recognition of families although in some cases it can also help in the identificat ion of lower taxa. The armature of the first proctodaeal <b>segment</b> and enteric <b>valve</b> is much important than the ornamentation of any other portion of the alimentary canal for study of taxonomy and phylogeny of termites. It provides a set of characters demarkating each genus and, in some cases, species also. On the basis of which a key to the families and genera is produced. The cuticular structures lining the alimentary canal of termites, particularly in the region of the first proctodaeal segment and enteric value, has been found to be very helpful in unstanding termite phylogeny (Grasse and Noirot, 1954; Ahmad, 1976. 1963,Sands, 1972; Ahmad and Akhter, 1981). Their conservative nature is further revealed by the present study. The phylogenetic relationships of lower termites established as a result of the present study generally lend support to most of the studies made by earlier workers. In some cases, however, new relationships are indicated. The position of the family Mastotermitidae in the Isoptera as determined by earlier workers is supported by the present study also. The phylogenetic scheme of the family Kalotermitidae worked out on the basis of the cuticular ornamentation of the alimentary canal, however, shows several important differences from the phylogenetic study of Krishna (1961). The findings of the present study are more in agreement with Grasse (1949) in regard to the status of the genera Hodotermes, Microhodotermes, Anacanthetermes, Archotermopsis, Zootermopsis, Porotermes and Stolotermes. Based on the cuticular ornamentation of the alimentary canal, these genera fall in two distinct groups, one represented by Archotermopsis, Zootermopsis, Stolotermes and Porotermes and the other by Hodotermes, Microhodotermes and Anacantho termes. According to the present study also, the two groups should have the status of families, Termopsidae and Hodotermitidae, as suggested by Grasse (1949). The origin of Rhinotermitidae from a stock which had imago worker mandibles conforming to Archotermopsis-Stolotermes type as suggested by Ahmad (1950), Emerson (1968, 1971) and Emerson and Krishna (1975) is also supported by the present study. According to the characteristics of the cuticular ornamentation of the alimentary canal also, the rhinotermitid genera can be put into two groups, representing the two main branches of the phylogenetic tree as suggested by Ahmad (1950), First group includes the genera of the Rhinotermitinae and the second the genera belonging to other subfamilies of Rhinotermitidae. The assignment of the genus Prorhinotermes to its proper place is still prob 1 ematic. The earlier worker (Ahmad 1950, Emerson 1971), Emerson and Krishna 1975 also reported that Prorhinotermes shared characters of the both groups but on the basis of then existing knowledge, they preferred to treat it as a member of the subfamily Rhinotermitinae. The present study, however, indicates its greater affinity with the second group, I am therefore putting it on the second main branch and assign to a new subfamily, Prorhinotermitinae. The present comparative study of the cuticular ornamentation lining the alimentary canal of termites shows that some of the characters have regressed while some have more advanced during the course of evolution...|$|R

40|$|SummaryAlthough {{mitral valve}} {{prolapse}} as a disease entity has been recognized for over 50 years, its precise definition has been elusive. Initial reports based the diagnosis on auscultatory findings (late systolic click – murmur), with left ventricular angiography as a confirmative test. Echocardiography, first the M-mode, and subsequently the two-dimensional, became the dominant diagnostic modality. However, the early reports did not distinguish between billowing valve and flail valve. The advent of surgical repair techniques provided a different perspective; the surgical definition of {{mitral valve prolapse}} is often {{different from that of}} cardiologists. Intraoperative echocardiography gained wide acceptance necessitating a common language to describe precise terminology of the leaflet anatomy and definition of valve prolapse. The present report proposes a terminology and definitions of valve prolapse with relevance to surgical mitral valve repair. The addition of real-time 3 D transesophageal echocardiography now provides highly accurate localization of lesions and the multi <b>segment</b> assessment of <b>valve</b> pathology.

The steady-state level of mRNA for selected extracellular matrix macromolecules and metalloproteinases was assessed by quantitative (internal standard controlled) reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Among the investigated gene products, the decorin mRNA expression was significantly increased in degenerative valve compared with normal tissue (211 +/- 48 vs. 100 +/- 70, p< 0. 02). The level of fibrillin 2 also tended to be increased (194 +/- 88 vs. 100 +/- 81, p= 0. 08). These results suggest that myxomatous valvar tissue is characterized by an overexpression of mRNA for decorin. Owing {{to the role of}} this small leucine-rich proteoglycan in the regulation of fibril assembly and stability, this alteration may account for or is a result of a defective organization of the collagen and elastic fibers in this disease and contribute to the intrinsic distensibility and fragility of the myxomatous tissue.

40|$|Poster Session: UltrasoundMitral valve repair {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} operations for various mitral valve conditions. Echocardiography, being famous for its low-cost, non-invasiveness and speediness, is the dominant imaging modality used for carrying out mitral valve condition analysis in both pre-operative and intra-operative examinations. In order to perform analysis on different phases of a cardiac cycle, it is necessary to first classify the echocardiograhic data into volumes corresponding to the systole and diastole phases. This often requires tedious manual work. This paper presents a fully-automatic method for systole-diastole classification of real-time three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (RT- 3 D-TEE) data. The proposed method first resamples the data with radial cutting planes, <b>segments</b> the mitral <b>valve</b> by thresholding, and removes noise by median filtering. Classification is then carried out based on the number of identified mitral valve regions. A multiresolution processing scheme is proposed to further improve the classification accuracy by aggregating classification results obtained from different image resolution scales. The proposed method was evaluated against the classification results produced by a cardiologist. Experimental results show that the proposed method, without the use of computationally intensive algorithms or the use of any training database, can achieve a classification accuracy of 91. 04 %. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|The flight {{version of}} the HYDRA III hybrid rocket engine was built by the ExperimentalRaumfahrt-InteressenGemeinschaft e. V. (ERIG) in {{cooperation}} with the Institute of Aerospace Systems of TU Braunschweig. The HYDRA III engine was improved to a thrust of about 1300 N for the supersonic rocket named FAUST of the Studentische Experimental-Raketen program (STERN), which is initiated by the German Aerospace center (DLR). The launch of the FAUST rocket is planned to be {{at the end of this}} year at the Esrange Space Center in Kiruna (North Sweden). The aim of the STERN program is to motivate and educate students for aerospace sciences by developing a rocket. The ERIG advanced therefore the hybrid rocket engine HYDRA III, which bases on a liquid oxidizer and a solid fuel grain as propellants. Therefore, liquid nitrous oxide is used as oxidizer and hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) with metal powder as solid fuel grain. For the flight version of this engine a carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) oxidizer vessel and the CFRP flight pressure vessel with helium were used. Also a new lightweight flight version <b>valve</b> <b>segment</b> was used to control the high amount of oxidizer mass flow into the combustion chamber. The latest test results of this flight engine from the horizontal test bench as well as the set-up of the vertical test bench are presented...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{study the}} growth of the {{oropharynx}} and hypopharynx in infants and young children by measuring the lengths of the <b>segments</b> between nasopharyngeal <b>valve</b> and tongue base, tongue base and arytenoids, and arytenoids and upper esophageal sphincter. These measurements will be used as references for developing manofluoroscopy to study deglutition in infants and young children. Patients and Methods: Twenty-three children (14 boys, 9 girls) between birth and 4 years of age were prospectively studied. All children had near normal growth parameters and were free of medical illnesses or other major medical conditions that are known to influence the pharyngeal cavity. Lateral videofluoroscopy was used to assess the pharyngeal structures during breathing. All images were digitally recorded and analyzed using a computer program designed specifically for this study. Results and Conclusions: Statistically significant correlations were found between the age or height of the patient and the distance from velopharyngeal valve to tongue base and the distance from tongue base to arytenoids, showing a linear increase of the length of the oro- and hypopharynx with age and patient height. There {{was no significant difference in}} the pharyngeal distances between boys and girls. On the basis of these results, a linear regression comparison could be established to define the length of each pharyngeal segment for any age until 4 years and for the 50 th percentile of height. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Polymer {{processing}} {{has been}} limited {{by the lack of}} direct flow and pressure control of the polymer melt at multiple points in space and time. Improved axial and radial valve designs are discussed that require negligible actuation force to control the flow of the pressurized melt. The forces resulting from pressure loads and shear stresses are first analyzed for an axial valve pin. Subsequently, a radial valve design is implemented and experimentally characterized using neat polycarbonate. A sigmoidal response surface is fit to the experimental data and found to very well model the observed pressure drop as a function of flow rate and valve pin position. The juncture loss at the valve port is then characterized by estimating and removing the pressure drops in the circular flow <b>segments</b> of the <b>valve.</b> Analysis indicated that the juncture loss is inversely proportional to the exposed area, or vesica piscis, formed between the circular flow channel in the valve body and the flow port on the moving valve pin. While applicable to many different polymer processing operations, the validated models are used to show the dynamic valve pin position {{as a function of the}} desired flow rate and desired cavity pressure in the hot runner of an injection mold. Finally, the impact of the designs on lower power, more compact mechanical and control system designs are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Venous ulcers are {{the most}} common ulcers of the lower limb. It has a high {{morbidity}} and results in economic strain both at a personal and at a state level. Chronic venous hypertension either due to primary or secondary venous disease with perforator paucity, destruction or incompetence resulting in reflux is the underlying pathology, but inflammatory reactions mediated through leucocytes, platelet adhesion, formation of pericapillary fibrin cuff, growth factors and macromolecules trapped in tissue result in tissue hypoxia, cell death and ulceration. Duplex scan with colour flow is the most useful investigation for venous disease supplying information about patency, reflux, effects of proximal and distal compression, Valsalva maneuver and effects of muscle contraction. Most venous disease can be managed conservatively by leg elevation and compression bandaging. Drugs of proven benefit in venous disease are pentoxifylline and aspirin, but they work best in conjunction with compression therapy. Once ulceration is chronic or the patient does not respond to or cannot maintain conservative regime, surgical intervention treating the underlying venous hypertension and cover for the ulcer is necessary. The different modalities like sclerotherapy, ligation and stripping of superficial varicose veins, endoscopic subfascial perforator ligation, endovenous laser or radiofrequency ablation have similar long-term results, although short-term recovery is best with radiofrequency and foam sclerotherapy. For deep venous reflux, surgical modalities include repair of incompetent venous valves or transplant or transposition of a competent vein <b>segment</b> with normal <b>valves</b> to replace a post-thrombotic destroyed portion of the deep vein...|$|R
