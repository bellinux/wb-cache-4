40|$|Purpose: This work {{is based}} on our earlier {{research}} of the Resonant Recognition Model (RRM), where we have proposed that protein activation is electromagnetic in its nature. In this study we investigated experimentally the possibility of modulating the protein activity by the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>radiation</b> of the specific frequency. The concept is studied here by applying a visible light radiation to example of l-Lactate Dehydrogenase enzyme (LDH). Materials and methods: The selected LDH example is radiated by monochromatic visible light in a frequency range predicted computationally by the RRM. The kinetics of the irradiated LDH is measured by continuous monitoring of the NADH absorption at 340 nm. Results: A comparative analysis of the LDH enzyme activity {{before and after the}} electromagnetic field (EMF) exposures is performed. It was found that the LDH activity is selectively increased only by the radiation at the particular wavelengths of 595 nm and 828 nm. These experimentally determined wavelengths of the applied EMF are within the range predicted by the RRM. Conclusions: Results reveal the LDH activity was modulated by the EMF exposures at the computationally predicted frequencies. The RRM concept presented provides new insights into proteins <b>susceptibility</b> <b>to</b> perturbation by <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>radiation</b> and possibility <b>to</b> program, predict, design and modify proteins and their bioactivity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract|This paper {{proposes a}} method to {{estimate}} human exposure <b>to</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> eld <b>radiation</b> in a variable and highly multiscale problem. The electromagnetic eld is computed {{using a combination of}} two methods: a rigorous time domain and multiscale method, the DG-FDTD (Dual Grid Finite Dierence Time Domain) and a fast substitution model based on the use of transfer functions. The association of these methods is applied to simulate a scenario involving an antenna placed on a vehicle and a human body model located around it. The purpose is <b>to</b> assess the <b>electromagnetic</b> eld in the left eye of the human body model. It is shown that this combination permits to analyse many dierent positions in a fast and accurate way. 1. INTRODUCTION.

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{study of}} the IMP- 6 and IMP- 8 plasma and radio wave data was performed {{to try to find}} electron plasma oscillations associated with type III radio noise bursts and low-energy solar electrons. It is shown that electron plasma oscillations are seldom observed in association with solar electron events and type III radio bursts at 1. 0 AU. For the one case in which electron plasma oscillations are definitely produced by the electrons ejected by the solar flare the electric field strength is relatively small. <b>Electromagnetic</b> <b>radiation,</b> believed <b>to</b> be similar to the type III radio emission, is observed coming from the region of the more intense electron plasma oscillations upstream. Quantitative calculations of the rate of conversion of the plasma oscillation energy <b>to</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>radiation</b> are presented for plasma oscillations excited by both solar electrons and electrons from the bow shock.
