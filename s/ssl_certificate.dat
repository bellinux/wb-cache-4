25|$|With {{the help}} of the {{computing}} power of over half a million PlayStation 3 consoles, the distributed computing project Folding@home has been recognized by Guinness World Records as the most powerful distributed network in the world. The first record was achieved on September 16, 2007, as the project surpassed one petaFLOPS, which had never previously been attained by a distributed computing network. Additionally, the collective efforts enabled PS3 alone to reach the petaFLOPS mark on September 23, 2007. In comparison, the world's second-most powerful supercomputer at the time, IBM's BlueGene/L, performed at around 478.2teraFLOPS, which means Folding@home's computing power is approximately twice BlueGene/L's (although the CPU interconnect in BlueGene/L is more than one million times faster than the mean network speed in Folding@home). As of May 7, 2011, Folding@home runs at about 9.3 x86 petaFLOPS, with 1.6petaFLOPS generated by 26,000 active PS3s alone. In late 2008, a cluster of 200 PlayStation 3 consoles was used to generate a rogue <b>SSL</b> <b>certificate,</b> effectively cracking its encryption.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a loss of {{confidence}} in the security provided by <b>SSL</b> <b>certificates</b> and browser interfaces in the face of various attacks. As one response, basic <b>SSL</b> server <b>certificates</b> are being demoted to second-class status in conjunction with the introduction of Extended Validation (EV) <b>SSL</b> <b>certificates.</b> Unfortunately, EV <b>SSL</b> <b>certificates</b> may complicate the already difficult design challenge of effectively conveying certificate information to the average user. This study explores the interfaces related to <b>SSL</b> <b>certificates</b> in the most widely deployed browser (Internet Explorer 7), proposes an alternative set of interface dialogs, and compares their effectiveness through a user study involving 40 participants. The alternative interface was found to offer statistically significant improvements in confidence, ease of finding information, and ease of understanding. Such results from a modest re-design effort suggest considerable room for improvement in the user interfaces of browsers today. This work motivates further study of whether EV <b>SSL</b> <b>certificates</b> offer a robust foundation for improving Internet trust, or a further compromise to usable security for ordinary users...|$|R
