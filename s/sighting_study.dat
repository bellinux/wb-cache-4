40|$|The fixed {{concentration}} procedure (FCP) {{has been}} proposed {{as an alternative to}} the median lethal concentration (LC 50) test (organisation for economic co-operation and development (OECD) test guideline [TG] 403) for the assessment of acute inhalation toxicity. The FCP tests animals of a single gender (usually females) at a number of fixed concentration levels in a sequential fashion. It begins with a <b>sighting</b> <b>study</b> that precedes the main FCP study and is used to determine the main study starting concentration. In this paper, we propose a modification to the <b>sighting</b> <b>study</b> and suggest that it should be conducted using both male and female animals, rather than just animals of a single gender. Statistical analysis demonstrates that, when females are more sensitive, the new procedure is likely to give the same classification as the original FCP, whereas, if males are more sensitive, the new procedure is much less likely to lead to incorrect classification into a less toxic category. If there is no difference in the LC 50 for females and males, the new procedure is slightly more likely to classify into a more stringent class than the original FCP. Overall, these results show that the revised <b>sighting</b> <b>study</b> ensures gender differences in sensitivity do not significantly impact on the performance of the FCP, supporting its use as an alternative test method for assessing acute inhalation toxicity...|$|E

Includes bibliographical references (page 58 - 61). Marbelus is an Unani Medicine of unique combination of Bael (Aegle marmelos) fruit and Connessi (Holarrhena antidysenterica) bark, which is highly effective in diarrhoea, dysentery (Amoebic & Bacillary dysentery), giardiasis and helminthiasis. However, toxicity study of the Marbelus syrup is still lacking. The present study is to investigate the acute toxicity of Marbelus Syrup extract on Sprague Dawley rats at a dose of 2000 mg/kg body weight (BW). <b>Sighting</b> <b>study</b> was conducted in a stepwise procedure using the fixed doses of 5, 50, 300 and 2000 mg/kg BW. No signs of toxicity and no deaths were observed. Based on the <b>sighting</b> <b>study,</b> we selected a dose of 2000 mg/kg BW and observed for 14 days. The study includes control and treatment group, each consisting of 5 female rats. The single oral dose of the Marbelus syrup did not produce mortality or {{significant changes in the}} body weight, food and water consumption. In the female rats there was significant (p= 0. 045) increase (16. 40 %) in total protein where albumin content was increased (1. 56 %) but not significantly (p= 0. 458) different from their corresponding control values. The decrease in urea content (0. 80 % decrease; p= 0. 691) & uric acid content was decreased by (12. 54 %; p= 0. 203) which was not statistically significant. The increase in both HDL cholesterol content (10. 13 % increase; p= 0. 46) & total cholesterol content (14. 89 % increase; p= 0. 23) was not statistically significant. It was observed that about 13. 44 % increase in triglyceride content of treated female rats in comparison to their control female rats which was statistically significant(p= 0. 030).

In the <b>sighting</b> <b>study,</b> the test substances were administered in sequential manner to one animal each at 2000 and 5000 mg kg - 1 body weight followed by four animals at 5000 mg kg - 1 body weight in the main study; whereas the test materials with well documented traditional use were evaluated at 5000 mg kg - 1 body weight. The treated animals were observed for mortality, untoward clinical/toxic signs, alterations in body weight gain and necropsy findings during the study. The treated animals survived throughout the study period and did not reveal any treatment related major abnormal clinical signs at the tested dose levels for all the products. The overall percent body weight gain in rats treated with the herbal products was found to be normal during the 14 day observation period. On necropsy, no abnormalities were observed.

This {{species have}} been used to facilitate deliverance and delivery and to treat stomach ailment. The aqueous extract of leaves was studied by conventional pharmacological methods. Twelve female rats were randomly assigned in two groups of 6 animals each designated as control and treated groups. After a <b>sighting</b> <b>study,</b> one group of the fasted animals for 12 h received a single oral dose of 2000 mg/kg body weight of aqueous solution of Brillantaisia vogeliana while control group received distilled water. Oral consumption of 2 g/kg of Brillantaisia vogeliana produced neither mortality nor significant differences in the body and relative organs weights except relative liver weight between control and treated animals. Moreover, no abnormality and no histopathological changes were detectable between both control and treated animals. Hematological analysis showed no difference in any of the parameters tested (WBC count, platelet, total leukocytes, RBC count, hematocrit and hemoglobin estimation) in either control or treated groups. No significant change occurred in the blood chemistry parameters, including creatinine, urea nitrogen (UN), alkaline phosphatase, aspartate amino transferase (ASAT), alanine aminotransferase (ALAT), calcium and phosphorus.

There is no particular scientific evidence for the toxicology regarding the hydrogenated curcuminoids, so the present work reports {{the results of the}} studies investigating the acute (single dose) and subchronic (repeatedly 90  days) oral toxicity of the CuroWhite in Sprague Dawley rats. For acute oral toxicity testing a <b>sighting</b> <b>study</b> was conducted on female rats in a sequential manner to allow selection of the appropriate starting dose for the main study. In acute toxicity, the dosage was 2000  mg/kg body weight for four female rats. In the sub-chronic study, rats of both sexes divided into three groups and each group were orally treated with CuroWhite daily at 200, 400 and 800  mg/kg for 90  days consecutively. No evidence of treatment related toxicity was detected during the study. Thus, data analysis of mortality, body weight gain, feed consumption, clinical observations, hematology, organ weights and histopathological findings did not show significant differences between control and treated groups. It is concluded that CuroWhite orally administered to rats was safe and no drug-related toxicity was detected even at the highest doses investigated in both acute (2000  mg/kg) and subchronic toxicity (200, 400 and 800  mg/kg) studies. Based on the study, the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) value could be considered as 800  mg/kg per day in both the sexes. These results indicate that CuroWhite can be generally regarded as safe for use as a food additive...|$|E

40|$|Beta-Lactamase is a {{bacterial}} protein that provides resistance against beta-lactam antibiotics. TEM- 1 beta-lactamase {{is the most}} prevalent plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase in gram-negative bacteria. Normally, this enzyme has high levels of hydrolytic activity for penicillins, but mutant beta-lactamases have evolved with activity toward a variety of beta-lactam antibiotics. It {{has been shown that}} active site substitutions are responsible for changes in the substrate specificity. Since mutant beta-lactamases pose a serious threat to antimicrobial therapy, the mechanisms by which mutations can alter the substrate specificity of TEM- 1 beta-lactamase are of interest. Previously, screens of random libraries encompassing 31 of 55 active site amino acid positions enabled the identification of the residues responsible for maintaining the substrate specificity of TEM- 1 beta-lactamase. In addition to substitutions found in clinical isolates, many other specificity-altering mutations were also identified. Interestingly, many nonspecific substitutions in the N-terminal half of the active site omega loop were found to increase ceftazidime hydrolytic activity and decrease ampicillin hydrolytic activity. To complete the active <b>sight</b> <b>study,</b> eight additional random libraries were constructed and screened for specificity-altering mutations. All additional substitutions found to alter the substrate specificity were located in the C-terminal half of the active site loop. These mutants, much like the N-terminal omega loop mutants, appear to be less stable than the wild-type enzyme. Further analysis of a 165 -YYG- 167 triple mutant, selected for high levels of ceftazidime hydrolytic activity, provides an example of the correlation which exists between enzyme instability and increased ceftazidime hydrolytic activity in the ceftazidime-selected omega loop mutants...|$|R

Both laboratory simulations and line of <b>sight</b> <b>studies</b> are essential. Examples are given for ice bands observed toward high mass protostars, fields stars and recent work on ices in disks surrounding low mass protostars. A number of clear trends have emerged in recent years. One prominent ice component consists of an intimate mixture between H 2 O, CH 3 OH and CO 2 molecules. Apparently a stable balance exists between low temperature hydrogenation and oxidation reactions on grain surfaces. In contrast, an equally prominent ice component, consisting almost entirely of CO, must have accreted directly from the gas phase. Thermal processing, i. e. evaporation and crystallization, proves to be readily traceable in both these ice components. The spectroscopic signatures of energetic processing by cosmic rays and high energy photons from nearby protostars are weaker and not as well understood.

40|$|The shuttle {{imaging radar}} C/X {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) radar on board the space shuttle Endeavor imaged Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii, in April and October 1994 {{for the purpose of}} measuring active surface deformation by the methods of repeat-pass differential radar interferometry. Observations at 24 cm (L band) and 5. 6 cm (C band) wavelengths were reduced to interferograms showing apparent surface deformation over the 6 -month interval and over a succession of 1 -day intervals in October. A statistically significant local phase signature in the 6 -month interferogram is coincident with the Pu'u O'o lava vent. Interpreted as deformation, the signal implies centimeter-scale deflation in an area several kilometers wide surrounding the vent. Peak deflation is roughly 14 cm if the deformation is purely vertical, centered southward of the Pu'u O'o caldera. Delays in the radar signal phase induced by atmospheric refractivity anomalies introduce spurious apparent deformation signatures, at the level of 12 cm peak-to-peak in the radar line-of-sight direction. Though the phase observations are suggestive of the wide-area deformation measured by Global Positioning System (GPS) methods, the atmospheric effects are large enough to limit the interpretation of the result. It is difficult to characterize centimeter-scale deformations spatially distributed over tens of kilometers using differential interferometry without supporting simultaneous, spatially distributed measurements of reactivity along the radar line of <b>sight.</b> <b>Studies</b> of the interferometric correlation of images acquired at different times show that L band is far superior to C band in the vegetated areas, even when the observations are separated by only 1 day.

We detect about 180 known DIBs, of which about 25 were listed as tentative and are now confirmed. A dozen new DIB candidates longwards of 6900 Å are identified. We show that the observed 5797 Å DIB strength is in line with the Galactic correlation with reddening, whereas the 5780 Å DIB strength is relatively weak. This indicates the contribution of denser regions, where the UV penetration is reduced. The presence of dense cloud cores is supported by the detection of C 2 rotational transitions. Members of one DIB family (5797, 6379 Å and 6196, 6613 Å) behave coherently, although one can make a distinction between the two correlated pairs. The broadened profiles of narrow DIBs are shown to be consistent with the premise that each of the main clouds in the line of sight discerned in the interstellar K I profile is contributing proportionally to the DIB profile. We complement and extend the relation of DIB strength with reddening {E} (B-V), as well as with neutral hydrogen column density N(H I), respectively, using strongly reddened sightlines towards another four distant HMXBs. The 5780 Å DIB, and tentatively also the 5797 and 6613 Å DIBs, are better correlated to the gas tracer H I than to the dust tracer {E} (B-V). The resulting relationship can be applied to any line of sight to obtain an estimate of the H I column density.

40|$|The {{experience}} of being “present” in a mediated environment, such that it appears real, {{is known to be}} affected by deficits in perception yet little research has been devoted to disabled audiences. People with a visual impairment access audiovisual media by means of Audio Description, which gives visual information in verbal form. The AD user plays an active role, engaging their own perceptual processing systems and bringing real-world experiences to the mediated environment. In exploring visual impairment and presence, this thesis concerns a question fundamental to psychology, whether propositional and experiential knowledge equate. It casts doubt on current models of sensory compensation in the blind and puts forward an alternative hypothesis of linguistic compensation. Qualitative evidence from Study 1 suggests that, in the absence of bimodal (audio-visual) cues, words can compensate for missing visual information. The role of vision in multisensory integration is explored experimentally in Studies 2 and 3. Crossmodal associations arising both from direct perception and imagery are shown to be altered by visual experience. Study 4 tests presence in an auditory environment. Non-verbal sound is shown to enhance presence in the sighted but not the blind. Both Studies 3 and 4 support neuroimaging evidence that words are processed differently in the absence of <b>sight.</b> <b>Study</b> 5, comparing mental spatial models, suggests this is explained by explicit verbal encoding by people with a visual impairment. Study 6 tests the effect of words on presence and emotion elicitation in an audiovisual environment. In the absence of coherent information from the dialogue, additional verbal information significantly improves understanding. Moreover, in certain circumstances, Audio Description significantly enhances presence and successfully elicits a target emotion. A model of Audio Description is presented. Implications are discussed for theoretical models of perceptual processing and presence in those with and without sight...|$|R
