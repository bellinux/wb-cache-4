25|$|There were {{a number}} of <b>stop</b> <b>gates</b> {{throughout}} the canal, e.g. between lock 16 and lock 17, on section 17. For some reason, the list Unrau has does not list that lock. The others are listed by section number along the canal, but he did not provide a list of where the section numbers correspond to mileage numbers along the canal. Note that the greatest number of <b>stop</b> <b>gates</b> were between Lock 50 and 51, that is the 14 mile level which includes Big Pool. There are <b>stop</b> <b>gates</b> both before and after Big pool.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the pound}} was many miles long, {{sometimes}} the canal would be designed with <b>stop</b> <b>gates,</b> {{so that if}} there was a break in the canal the whole pound would not lose all its water. Isolating the break would allow the company to make repairs sooner. For instance, on the 14 mile level of the Chesapeake and Ohio canal, there were <b>stop</b> <b>gates</b> put before and after Big Pool so that it (the Big Pool lake) would not have to be drained [...] in case of breaks or repairs.|$|R

50|$|In 1854, Bromley Lock {{was moved}} and rebuilt to {{accommodate}} the larger barges which were using the navigation. A report written in 1888 noted that the lock {{was so full of}} rubbish that it did not maintain the water levels when the adjacent section was drawn down and in 1899 the company stated that the lock was only used when levels were drawn down for maintenance. The southern gates were removed soon afterwards, with the northern gates retained as a <b>stop</b> <b>gate.</b> Some remains of one of these gates can still be seen beside the floating towpath (for details of which see under Today).|$|E
40|$|A {{releasable}} {{stop for}} releasably stopping a vehicle moving through a conduit. A <b>stop</b> <b>gate</b> is supported for pivotal movement {{into and out}} of the path of movement of the vehicle. First and second arms are pivotally connected together between the gate and a support and a pneumatic piston and cylinder assembly actuates one arm for moving the gate between a closed and opened position. The pivoting arms are moved into or slightly past a dead center position when the gate is in the closed position whereby the impact of a vehicle engaging the gate will be transmitted to the support instead of to the piston and cylinder assembly. When the gate is closed, the dead center position of the arm maintains the <b>stop</b> <b>gate</b> in a locked position. The <b>stop</b> <b>gate</b> may be sized and shaped to entirely block the conduit to provide a dead end air cushion stop assist. In addition, the gate, the arms and the piston and cylinder assembly may be mounted on a movable support and a shock absorber may be connected to the movable support for resisting movement when heavy loads engage the gate.

40|$|An interpretative {{earthwork}} survey, photographic {{survey and}} watching brief were undertaken on {{a section of}} the Grand Western Canal, Halberton, Devon in association with restoration work around a breach in the canal embankment. Detailed plans, elevations and sections as well as a photographic record of the exposed fabric of the canal and associated infrastructure were completed. Boundary markers on the northern side of the canal which marked the limit of GWR's property in the late 19 th century were recorded prior to their temporary removal. A milestone marker was also recorded along the embankment, but this was not subject to disturbance. The Swing Bridge was recorded and identified as an original structure with a range of repairs and slight alterations. An engineering note from the late 19 th century records the structure as it appears today, suggesting limited subsequent alterations. Prior to the restoration works, the embankment of the canal was observed to be a simple construction consistent with documentary evidence of its construction. The restoration works within the canal route partially exposed in situ remains of a <b>stop</b> <b>gate</b> potentially dating {{to the use of the}} canal in the late 19 th century. No further features or deposits of archaeological interest were observed during the groundworks and, despite visual scanning of spoil, no artefactual material pre-dating the modern period was recovered...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop a toll station layout optimisation methodology based on toll plaza circulation safety analysis. Then we propose a mathematical model assessing the expected level of traffic safety associated with the toll station layout, actual or planned, due to a given configuration for toll gate types and positions. The model has been conceived in order to let the planner be able to decide the proper sequence of gate types which minimises the risk of accidents. The decision variables are mainly related to the assignment of a gate type – manual gate with operator, ETC gate, semiautomatic or short <b>stop</b> <b>gate</b> – to each gate position in the station. The resulting multi-toll-type assignment model, or MTTA, takes into account the probability of interaction between pairs of traffic streams originated from the different lanes of the highway and directed to specific gate types; different severity and risk indices are associated both with vehicle types and with destination gate types. The computational tests have been performed on observed data collected during several hours of video-camera images recorded in five different motorway multi-type toll plazas located in Tuscany (Italy). Our results support the evidence that gates associated to higher risk traffic flows, e. g. traffic directed to ETC gates which approaches the toll station at speeds significantly above the average, should be locate in a central position with respect to other gate types. Moreover, the experimental results disagree with the general operations practice of many Italian motorway Agencies, which usually place ETC gates on the far side of the toll plaza...|$|E
40|$|In 2006, Waikato Regional Council (WRC) {{provided}} {{research funding}} for the Coastal Marine Group, Department of Earth and Ocean Sciences, University of Waikato, to undertake research on the impacts of tsunami inundation on Whitianga town and harbour. The main aims of the study are to: ● Identify potential tsunami sources; ● Establish an understanding of tsunami inundation impacts in Whitianga township and harbour – including the hydrodynamic processes and responses of Mercury Bay, Buffalo Bay, Whitianga Harbour and adjacent land to tsunami wave action; ● Develop tsunami inundation maps, showing depth and velocity (speed) of tsunami waves; and ● Provide sound evidence upon which to base community risk mitigation measures – including recommendations for evacuation planning, public education and awareness, protection of infrastructure, management of impacts to marine vessels and future land use planning. The numerical model {{used in this study}} is the 3 DD Suite-Computational Marine and Freshwater Laboratory model (Black, 2001). The model has demonstrated the ability to accurately reproduce tsunami hydrodynamics during propagation and run up on both laboratory and real-world scales. There are three primary tsunami sources that could potentially affect Whitianga from the Kermadec Trench, and beyond the New Zealand continental shelf, being: 1. Mt Healy undersea volcano eruptions (15 th Century event); 2. Large earthquakes along segments 1 and 2 of the Kermadec Trench subduction zone; and 3. A 1960 Chilean-type earthquake event. Each source is modelled, and the results that show the greatest risk and impacts to Whitianga are used {{as the basis for the}} hazard maps and hazard zones. Modelling results indicate that: • The Mt Healy type of eruption produced a minimal impact on Whitianga. The tsunami waves generated from this event did not inundate Whitianga. Despite this, strong currents of up to 2. 5 m/s were generated inside Buffalo Bay and at the Whitianga Harbour inlet. •The Kermadec Trench earthquake scenarios with both positive and negative leading waves, as a result of a subduction fault dislocation along segments 1 and 2, have a significant impact on Whitianga. The waves inundate the coastal area up to 2. 5 and 3 km inland for the subduction thrust fault and normal fault events respectively, and affect the entire area of Whitianga Harbour. The normal fault event that produces positive leading waves has more impact than the thrust fault event that produces negative leading waves. • The 1960 Chilean-type earthquake event produced tsunami waves that inundated Buffalo Beach Road and houses in Whitianga, as observed by eyewitnesses. Strong currents of up to 5 m/s are generated inside Buffalo Bay and the Whitianga Harbour inlet. The modelling indicates that: • Whitianga would be inundated five times by a Kermadec Trench earthquake scenario, and three times by a 1960 Chilean-type of tsunami • For the Kermadec Trench scenario (normal fault), the first waves penetrate Mercury Bay within 75 – 98 minutes after the fault rupture • Regardless of the tsunami source, it takes 11 – 18 minutes for waves to arrive at the Whitianga foreshore once they have entered Mercury Bay. The modelling indicates that the period between waves is 40 – 60 minutes, which is consistent with the 1960 Chilean event. The geometry of Buffalo Bay and Mercury Bay amplify the incoming tsunami waves, and the sea level inside the bay continues to oscillate, even after the sea level outside of Mercury Bay returns to normal. This situation is consistent with eyewitness accounts of the 1960 Chilean tsunami. Modelling also shows that strong currents are produced within Buffalo Bay and Whitianga Harbour, as well as during the overland flows - especially in areas adjacent to the Taputapuatea Stream and in the foreshore area between Albert Street and the wharf. The flow speed ranged from 1. 5 m/s to 8 m/s for overland flows, and above 8 m/s within the entrance of Whitianga Harbour and in the middle of Buffalo Bay. For the first time in New Zealand, a combination of non-ground striking and ground striking LIDAR data was used in modelling tsunami inundation, which increased the accuracy of the modelling results considerably. Inundation flow behaviour and the effect of topography, as well as land use, can be analysed more accurately, and a more precise hazard map can be produced accordingly. Mitigation measures suggested to protect the Whitianga waterfront include a combination of enhanced coastal sand dunes and planted forest belts, which could be done along both sides of the Taputapuatea Stream. A <b>stop</b> <b>gate</b> could also be constructed at the entrance of the Taputapuatea Stream to minimise the impact of the tsunami flows upstream. With respect to evacuation, it is concluded that due to the lag time between a local event from the Kermadec Trench and wave arrival at the Whitianga foreshore, there is enough time for residents to be evacuated to shelter sites using major roads. Three locations are identified as evacuation shelter sites. These are the marina parking area and Buffalo Beach scenic reserve (both of which are located on high ground adjacent to the high-risk zone), and further inland at the airfield. Vertical evacuation sites are needed inside the high-risk zone, and recommendations on potential locations are provided. It is important that vertical evacuation measures are integrated into community response plans, and that they be reviewed and revised regularly. Overland flow information derived from modelling using the ground-striking and non-ground striking LIDAR data provides a basis to influence new development that occurs within tsunami hazard risk zones. Overland flow information also indicates the areas of existing development that need protection from future tsunami events. Risk mitigation may be accomplished through redevelopment, retrofit, coastal defence measures, safety planning for ships and boats, land reuse plans, and also via public education and awareness programmes. A major challenge of risk mitigation is to maintain emergency preparedness programmes and procedures when the threat of tsunami is perceived as remote. Periodic exercises are essential to maintain awareness, and regular information should be provided for those occupying tsunami hazard areas. Tsunami are rare events, but their impacts on coastal communities can be devastating. It is quite dangerous to believe that the impacts of a tsunami can be completely prevented by man-made structures (Horikawa and Shuto, 1983). However, possible impacts may be minimised through careful design of solutions based on systematic research. An important consideration for risk mitigation works is that they may affect the quality of daily life, and risk mitigation involves choices and trade-offs between risk management and other uses. Video animations of each scenario are provided at regional, intermediate and local scales. The animations cover tsunami wave behaviour during generation, propagation, run up, and overland flows, and may be used to inform land use planning and public education and awareness programmes...|$|E

25|$|Floodgates, {{also called}} <b>stop</b> <b>gates,</b> are {{adjustable}} gates {{used to control}} water flow in flood barriers, reservoir, river, stream, or levee systems. They may be designed to set spillway crest heights in dams, to adjust flow rates in sluices and canals, {{or they may be}} designed to stop water flow entirely as part of a levee or storm surge system. Since most of these devices operate by controlling the water surface elevation being stored or routed, they are also known as crest gates. In the case of flood bypass systems, floodgates sometimes are also used to lower the water levels in a main river or canal channels by allowing more water to flow into a flood bypass or detention basin when the main river or canal is approaching a flood stage.|$|R
