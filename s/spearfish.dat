40|$|Although <b>spearfishing</b> is {{a popular}} method of {{capturing}} fish, its ecological effects on fish populations are poorly understood, which {{makes it difficult to}} assess the legitimacy and desirability of <b>spearfishing</b> in multi-use marine reserves. Recent management changes within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (GBRMP) fortuitously created a unique scenario by which to quantify the effects of <b>spearfishing</b> on fish populations. As such, we employed underwater visual surveys and a before-after-control-impact experimental design to investigate the effects of <b>spearfishing</b> on the density and size structure of target and non-target fishes in a multi-use conservation park zone (CPZ) within the GBRMP. Three years after <b>spearfishing</b> was first allowed in the CPZ, there was a 54 % reduction in density and a 27 % reduction in mean size of coral trout (Plectropomus spp.), the primary target species. These changes were attributed to <b>spearfishing</b> because benthic habitat characteristics and the density of non-target fishes were stable through time, and the density and mean size of coral trout in a nearby control zone (where <b>spearfishing</b> was prohibited) remained unchanged. We conclude that <b>spearfishing,</b> like other forms of fishing, can have rapid and substantial negative effects on target fish populations. Careful management of <b>spearfishing</b> is therefore needed to ensure that conservation obligations are achieved and that fishery resources are harvested sustainably. This is particularly important both for the GBRMP, due to its extraordinarily high conservation value and world heritage status, and for tropical island nations where people depend on <b>spearfishing</b> for food and income.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Spearfishing</b> was {{becoming}} {{an increasingly important}} economic activity in the Caribbean {{as a result of}} socioeconomic factors related to underemployment and the low capital outlay for equipment. For a year (2011) we surveyed <b>spearfishing</b> in 23 Jamaican beaches. <b>Spearfishing</b> has expanded from approximately 1 % of fishers in 1991 to about 10 % in 2011. The fishery is larger than expected and probably produced 4 000 tons per year. Though reef fishes dominated catches, other resources such as lobsters, conch and octopus were regularly taken. Many small juvenile fishes were observed in catches well below their adult or optimum sizes. A total of 58 % of spear-fishers reported they would have significant difficulty finding alternative employment if <b>spearfishing</b> was banned. Spearfishers reported exploiting the entire island shelf and also nearly all the offshore banks, especially Pedro Bank. Night <b>spearfishing</b> was common and targeted sleeping reef fishes. The activity is banned and should be enforced. Our recommendations include: register all spearfishers, actively man-age <b>spearfishing,</b> a partial ban for part of the year and a ban on using scuba and hookah gear for <b>spearfishing...</b>|$|R
25|$|The Formigas Bank is {{essentially}} a submarine volcano, inhabited by deep-dwelling marine species, coral and sponges. The cone is delimited approximately by the islets of the northwest and the Dollabarats reef to the southeast. In the ancient crater there is a rich community of species common to the Azores. Among the species typical of the area are wrasse (Mediterranean rainbow wrasse, ornate wrasse), damselfish, sergeant fish (yellow and black), grouper, Mediterranean parrotfish, and the emblematic Atlantic goliath grouper, Serranidae and barred hogfish. Alongside these are pelagic predators that also reside in the bank (African threadfish, longbill <b>spearfish)</b> and migratory species that travel between destinations (like the manta ray and whale shark).|$|E

40|$|In recent decades, <b>spearfishing</b> with SCUBA {{has emerged}} as an {{efficient}} method for targeting reef fish in deeper waters. However, deeper waters are increasingly recognised as a potential source of refuge that may help sustain fishery resources. We used a combination of historical catch data over a 20 -year time period and fishery-independent surveys to investigate the effects of SCUBA <b>spearfishing</b> on coral reef fish populations in the southern Mariana Islands. Two jurisdictions were studied; Guam, where SCUBA <b>spearfishing</b> is practiced, and the nearby Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), where SCUBA <b>spearfishing</b> has been banned since 2003. Fishery-independent data were collected using baited remote underwater stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) stratified by depth, marine protected area status and jurisdiction. Herbivores (primary consumers) dominated <b>spearfishing</b> catches, with parrotfish (scarines) and surgeonfish/unicornfish (acanthurids) the main groups harvested. However, the large, endangered humphead wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus) was the main species by weight landed by SCUBA spearfishers. SCUBA <b>spearfishing</b> was associated with declining size of scarines over time and catches shifting from a dominance of large parrotfishes to a mixed assemblage with increasing proportions of acanthurids. Comparisons between Guam and the nearby CNMI revealed differences in the assemblage of fished species and also greater size of scarines and acanthurids in deep water where SCUBA fishing is banned. These results suggest that SCUBA <b>spearfishing</b> impacts reef fish populations and that the restriction of this fishing method will ensure refuge for fis...|$|R
