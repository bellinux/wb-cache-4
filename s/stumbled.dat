5|$|The {{events of}} the Buffalo Grove ambush are closely interrelated {{with those of the}} St. Vrain massacre. A group of four men, {{including}} Aaron Hawley and John Fowler, both casualties of the St. Vrain massacre, was en route to Galena when they <b>stumbled</b> upon the body of Durley at Buffalo Grove. The group returned to Dixon's Ferry, reported their find and stayed there overnight.|$|E
40|$|The Ottawalk-Speed (OWS) {{orthosis}} prevents knee {{collapse in}} <b>stumble</b> situations. The {{purpose of this}} study was to develop a virtual <b>stumble</b> perturbation to measure OWS response to a knee collapse when walking. A new split speed perturbation was developed for the CAREN virtual reality system. This perturbation induced a <b>stumble</b> with increased knee flexion for five able-bodied participants, with either a hopping or stopping recovery strategy. Three knee-ankle-foot orthosis users were subjected to five <b>stumble</b> trials while wearing the OWS. OWS participants used a straight-legged recovery strategy, and extended the knee through recovery weight acceptance. Therefore, the split speed perturbation was not appropriate to measure OWS response to a <b>stumble</b> since knee collapse did not occur. The OWS allowed free knee motion during gait. Further study is required to measure OWS response during a <b>stumble</b> with a knee collapse event...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} (1) {{what kind}} of "role" students play in cooperative learning, and (2) {{what kind of}} "stumbles" they face in their learning in a students-centered education {{as part of the}} general education of a university. The role is one of the very important viewpoints in learning theory, and students cannot develop their learning without various <b>stumbles,</b> compromises, and even failures as well. In this case, students faced three stumbles“, Gap between students," "Making their activity autotelic", and "Downward revisions of their learning target". In these <b>stumbles,</b> to bring students' various opinions to a better conclusion, a student tried to explain his own opinion to make the other members consent, and another student tried to coordinate members' various ideas in discussion in class time or various schedules to meet for discussion outside the class time. It is thought that they tried to take a suitable role and to play it, but they could not do it well. In these <b>stumbles</b> they tried to change their role to make the idea of their group advanced in the class, or tried to acquire the ability to overcome the <b>stumbles</b> at other classes and internships after this class had ended, or evaluated the <b>stumbles</b> affirmatively and assumed the <b>stumbles</b> to be an index of their learning and life afterwards. Through this case, we can see that these <b>stumbles</b> offer opportunities for students to be autonomous and cooperative subjects on their learning. So, a <b>stumble</b> is not a "failure of learning" or "what the teacher should exclude". The <b>stumble</b> offers the possibility that the general education curriculum can be reconstructed from the viewpoint of students' learning...|$|R
5|$|The {{publisher}} {{was encouraged}} by the book's critical and financial success and, therefore, requested a sequel. As Tolkien's work progressed on the successor The Lord of the Rings, he made retrospective accommodations for it in The Hobbit. These few but significant changes were integrated into the second edition. Further editions followed with minor emendations, including those reflecting Tolkien's changing concept of the world into which Bilbo <b>stumbled.</b>|$|E
5|$|This {{meant that}} {{the fate of the}} Ashes would be {{determined}} by the final match at The Oval. Hassett warmed up with consecutive half-centuries against Surrey and Warwickshire. In the second innings of the latter match, he made 21 not out, holding the team together as Australia <b>stumbled</b> to 5/53 in pursuit of 166 for victory when time ran out.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech's first {{possession}} of the half was slightly more successful than Wake Forest's, as the Yellow Jackets drove inside the Deacons' 30-yard line on several passes from Reggie Ball. Again, however, the Tech defense <b>stumbled.</b> Facing a fourth down inside the Wake Forest red zone, Tech elected to attempt to convert the first down rather than punt the ball. Despite needing just one yard to gain another first down, Georgia Tech was stopped short of the line. The play {{was typical of the}} third quarter, which saw both teams fail to score.|$|E

40|$|Falling is {{a serious}} health problem for many elderly. To {{investigate}} whether the higher fall incidence in elderly {{is due to a}} higher probability of experiencing near falls in daily life, it is necessary to evaluate the <b>stumble</b> incidence of elderly in daily life. Accelerometers are already frequently used for in vivo activity monitoring. The current study investigates whether an ambulant and unobtrusive accelerometer can identify <b>stumbles</b> from treadmill walking using a wavelet based detection approach. Seventy nine healthy subjects walked on a treadmill with a triaxial accelerometer attached {{at the level of the}} sacrum. <b>Stumbles</b> were induced using a specially designed braking system (The TRiP). The TRiP evoked 30 <b>stumbles</b> at different phases of the swing phase.

The unit claimed an Auster reconnaissance aircraft shot down. The machine was probably a Stinson L-1 Vigilant of the 125th Liaison Squadron, U.S. Army. However, virtually the entire Gruppe of 17 Fw 190s was wiped out.|$|E

5|$|Adult giant otters {{living in}} family groups have no known serious natural predators, however {{there are some}} {{accounts}} of black caimans in Peru and yacare caimans in the Pantanal preying on giant otters. In addition, solitary animals and young may be vulnerable to attacks by the jaguar, cougar, and anaconda, but {{this is based on}} historical reports, not direct observation. Pups are more vulnerable, and may be taken by caiman and other large predators, although adults are constantly mindful of stray young, and will harass and fight off possible predators. When in the water, the giant otter faces danger from animals not strictly preying upon it: the electric eel and stingray are potentially deadly if <b>stumbled</b> upon, and piranha may be capable of at least taking bites out of a giant otter, as evidenced by scarring on individuals.|$|E

Andrew Kerr became head coach at Stanford during Warner's last two years at Pitt. Warner's final season was his worst at Pitt, as the Panthers <b>stumbled</b> to a 5–4 record in 1923.
