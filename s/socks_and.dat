5|$|The {{types of}} {{clothing}} worn and {{the materials used}} during the Han period depended upon social class.

Peasants commonly wore clothes made of hemp, wool, and ferret skins.|$|E
5|$|Pistorius {{has been}} using the same Össur blades since 2004. He was born without fibulae and with malformed feet, and his legs were amputated about halfway between knee and ankle so he could wear {{prosthetic}} legs. He wears <b>socks</b> <b>and</b> pads which are visible above the sockets to reduce chafing and to prevent blisters, and the sockets have straps in the front that can be tightened to make the prosthesis fit more snugly.|$|E

5|$|For the poor, hemp was {{the common}} item {{used to make}} clothing, while the rich could afford silk clothes. Silk clothes found in Han tombs include padded robes, {{double-layered}} robes, single-layered robes, single-layered skirts, shoes, <b>socks,</b> <b>and</b> mittens. The wealthy also wore fox and badger furs, wild duck plumes, and slippers with inlaid leather or silk lining; those of more modest means could wear wool and ferret skins. Large bamboo-matted suitcases found in Han tombs contained clothes and luxury items such as patterned fabric and embroidery, common silk, damask and brocade, and the leno (or gauze) weave, all with rich colors and designs. The Han also had tools for ironing clothes.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to get Chris into Morningwood Academy, Peter is forced by Carter Pewterschmidt to appear in a remake of the 1997 comedy film Liar Liar. After Chris is {{accepted}} to Morningwood Academy, he is asleep in his bed for the night, and is suddenly attacked by a group of classmates, who stuff wads of dollar bills into their <b>socks,</b> <b>and</b> quickly begin beating him with the weapons. This scene is a parody of that of the infamous sequence shown in director Stanley Kubrick's 1987 war film Full Metal Jacket, in which the Marine recruits take turns striking Private Pyle with bars of soap wrapped in towels as punishment for frequently getting them in trouble.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps the most-quoted anecdote {{concerning}} Hardee was that, on 9 October 1986 {{his house}} was searched by the police – who were looking for crumbs – two days after he and others stole Freddie Mercury's £4,000 40th birthday cake. No crumbs were found at the house as he had already by then donated the cake to a local nursing home. He used this incident {{as the title of}} his 1996 autobiography I Stole Freddie Mercury's Birthday Cake which he wrote with John Fleming. In another encounter with the police, Hardee was once questioned by Special Branch officers after being found on the balcony outside government minister Michael Heseltine's hotel room, wearing nothing but a pair of <b>socks</b> <b>and</b> a leather coat containing £5,200 in cash and a pack of pornographic playing cards. He had mistaken the room for that of a friend.|$|E
5|$|In the 1st and 2nd centuries, a Roman soldier's clothes {{consisted}} of a single-piece, short-sleeved tunic the hem of which reached the knees and special hobnailed sandals (caligae). This attire, which left the arms and legs bare, had evolved in a Mediterranean climate and was not suitable for northern Europe in cold weather. In northern Europe, long-sleeved tunics, trousers (bracae), socks (worn inside the caligae) and laced boots were commonly worn in winter from the 1st century. During the 3rd century, these items of clothing became much more widespread, apparently common in Mediterranean provinces also. However, {{it is likely that}} in warmer weather, trousers were dispensed with and caligae worn instead of <b>socks</b> <b>and</b> boots. Late Roman clothing was often highly decorated, with woven or embroidered strips, clavi, circular roundels, orbiculi, or square panels, tabulae, added to tunics and cloaks. These colourful decorative elements usually {{consisted of}} geometrical patterns and stylised plant motifs, but could include human or animal figures. A distinctive part of a soldier's costume, though it seems to have also been worn by non-military bureaucrats, was a type of round, brimless hat known as the pannonian cap (pileus pannonicus).|$|E
