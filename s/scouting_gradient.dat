40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{possibility}} of retention modeling in the HILIC mode was investigated, testing several different literature relationships {{over a wide range}} of different analytical conditions (column chemistries and mobile phase pH) and using analytes possessing diverse physico-chemical properties. Furthermore, it was investigated how the retention prediction depends on the number of isocratic or gradient trial or initial scouting runs. The most promising set of scouting runs seems to be a combination of three isocratic runs (95, 90 and 70 %ACN) and one gradient run (95 to 65 %ACN in 10 min), as the average prediction errors were lower than using six equally spaced isocratic runs and because it is common in Method development (MD) to perform at least one <b>scouting</b> <b>gradient</b> run in the screening step to find out the best column, temperature and pH conditions. Overall, the retention predictions were much less accurate in HILIC than what is usually experienced in RPLC. This has severe implications for MD, as it restricts the use of commercial software packages that require the simulation of the retention of every peak in the chromatogram. To overcome this problem, the recently proposed predictive elution window shifting and stretching (PEWS 2) approach can be used. In this computer-assisted MD strategy, only an (approximate) prediction of the retention of the first and the last peak in the chromatogram is required to conduct a well-targeted trial-and-error search, with suggested search conditions uniformly covering the entire possible search and elution space. This strategy was used to optimize the separation of three representative pharmaceutical mixtures possessing diverse physico-chemical properties (pteridins, saccharides and cocktail of drugs/metabolites). All problems could be successfully handled in less than 2. 5 h of instrument time (including equilibration) ...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the potential of non-linear gradients in hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC), to improve the separation between the different homologous species (drug-toantibody, DAR) of commercial antibody-drug conjugates (ADC). The selectivities between Brentuximab Vedotin species were measured using three different gradient profiles, namely linear, power function based and logarithmic ones. The logarithmic gradient provides the most equidistant retention distribution for the DAR species and offers the best overall separation of cysteine linked ADC in HIC. Another important advantage of the logarithmic gradient, is its peak focusing effect for the DAR 0 species, which is particularly useful to improve the quantitation limit of DAR 0. Finally, the logarithmic behavior of DAR species of ADC in HIC was modelled using two different approaches, based on i) the linear solvent strength theory (LSS) and two <b>scouting</b> linear <b>gradients</b> and ii) a new derived equation and two logarithmic <b>scouting</b> <b>gradients.</b> In both cases, the retention predictions were excellent and systematically below 3 % compared to the experimental values...|$|R
40|$|The {{applicability}} and predictive {{properties of}} the linear solvent strength model and two nonlinear retention-time models, i. e., the quadratic model and the Neue model, were assessed for the separation of small molecules (phenol derivatives), peptides, and intact proteins. Retention-time measurements were conducted in isocratic mode and gradient mode applying different gradient times and elution-strength combinations. The quadratic model provided the most accurate retention-factor predictions for small molecules (average absolute prediction error of 1. 5 %) and peptides separations (with a prediction error of 2. 3 %). An advantage of the Neue model {{is that it can}} provide accurate predictions based on only three <b>gradient</b> <b>scouting</b> runs, making tedious isocratic retention-time measurements obsolete. For peptides, the use of <b>gradient</b> <b>scouting</b> runs in combination with the Neue model resulted in better prediction errors (< 2. 2 %) compared to the use of isocratic runs. The applicability of the quadratic model is limited due to a complex combination of error and exponential functions. For protein separations, only a small elution window could be applied, which is due to the strong effect of the content of organic modifier on retention. Hence, the linear retention-time behavior of intact proteins is well described by the linear solvent strength model. Prediction errors using <b>gradient</b> <b>scouting</b> runs were significantly lower (2. 2 %) than when using isocratic scouting runs (3. 2 %). © 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.

40|$|The {{multi-modal}} retention {{mechanism in}} supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC) {{results in a}} non-linear dependency of log(k) on the fraction of organic solvent φ and log(φ). In the present study, the possibility of retention modeling for method development purposes in SFC was investigated, considering several non-linear isocratic relationships. Therefore, both isocratic and gradient runs were performed, involving different column chemistries and analytes possessing diverse physico-chemical properties. The isocratic retention data of these compounds could be described accurately using the non-linear retention models typically used in HILIC and reversed-phase LC. The interconversion between isocratic and gradient retention data {{was found to be}} less straightforward than in RPLC and HILIC because of pressure effects. The possibility of gradient predictions using <b>gradient</b> <b>scouting</b> runs to estimate the retention parameters was investigated as well, showing that predictions for other gradients with the same starting conditions were acceptable (always below 5 %), whereas prediction errors for gradients with a different starting condition were found to be highly dependent on the compound. The second part of the study consisted of the gradient optimization of two pharmaceutical mixtures (one involving atorvastatin and four related impurities, and one involving a 16 components mixture including eight drugs and their main phase I metabolites). This could be done via individual retention modeling based on <b>gradient</b> <b>scouting</b> runs. The best linear gradient was found via a grid search and the best multi-segment gradient via the previously published one-segment-per-component search. The latter improved the resolution between the critical pairs for both mixtures, while still giving accurate prediction errors (using the same starting concentrations as the <b>gradient</b> <b>scouting</b> runs used to build the model). The optimized separations were found in less than 3 h and 8 h of analysis time (including equilibration times), respectively...|$|R
