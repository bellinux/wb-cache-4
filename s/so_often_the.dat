5|$|Every <b>so</b> <b>often,</b> <b>the</b> player {{will come}} {{to a point where}} he or she is given the chance to choose from {{multiple}} options. The time between these points is variable and can occur anywhere from a minute to much longer. Gameplay pauses at these points and depending on which choice the player makes, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are four main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. The plot lines carry on from each other in a linear fashion. The game can end prematurely if the player makes the wrong decisions. When this occurs, the player must go back to a previously saved spot and choose different decisions.|$|E
5|$|There are six main plot {{lines that}} the player {{will have the}} chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Every <b>so</b> <b>often,</b> <b>the</b> player will come to a point where he or she is given the chance to choose from {{multiple}} options. Text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. Each scenario is divided into eight episodes, one interlude episode and an epilogue. At the end of an episode, an announcement of the next episode appears showing a preview of what is to consist in the next episode. Each episode takes place within the span of one month between June and March from episode one through the epilogue. The interlude episode is placed between the second and third episodes.|$|E
25|$|Turquoise {{is treated}} to enhance both its colour and {{durability}} (i.e., increased hardness and decreased porosity). As is <b>so</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> case with any precious stones, full disclosure about treatment is frequently not given. It is therefore left to gemologists to detect these treatments in suspect stones {{using a variety}} of testing methods—some of which are necessarily destructive. For example, the use of a heated probe applied to an inconspicuous spot will reveal oil, wax, or plastic treatment with certainty.|$|E

25|$|Despite Priscilla's {{affair and}} Elvis' on-and-off {{relationships}} with his co-stars and leading ladies, {{the first few}} years they were married seemed a happy time for the couple. However, when Elvis' career took off again after his 1968 television special, he was constantly touring and playing in Las Vegas. Elvis had also been seeing other women on and off, often leaving Priscilla at home with Lisa Marie. Due to Elvis' being away <b>so</b> <b>often,</b> <b>the</b> marriage soured.|$|E
25|$|This {{flexibility}} allows Catalan to use extraposition extensively, {{much more}} than French or Spanish. Thus, Catalan can have m'hi recomanaren ("they recommended me to him"), whereas in French one must say ils m'ont recommandé à lui, and Spanish me recomendaron a él. This allows the placement of almost any nominal term as a sentence topic, without having to use <b>so</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> passive voice (as in French or English), or identifying the direct object with a preposition (as in Spanish).|$|E
25|$|As well as {{the station}} buildings, signals and interlocking, the station was beautified. The {{ornamental}} planting proposed in the 1910 scheme was developed by George Wreidt and Bert Wickham, both station masters at Kuranda. The tropical vegetation in the platform's gardens and under the platform shelters helped to soften {{the lines of the}} station, which first won the Northern Division of the Railways' Annual Garden Competition in 1915 and was <b>so</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> winner in subsequent years that it became folklore that Kuranda won every year.|$|E

25|$|Magic and {{religion}} were {{an integral part}} of everyday life in ancient Egypt. Evil gods and demons were thought to be responsible for many ailments, <b>so</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> treatments involved a supernatural element, such as beginning treatment with an appeal to a deity. There {{does not appear to have}} existed a clear distinction between what nowadays one would consider the very distinct callings of priest and physician. The healers, many of them priests of Sekhmet, often used incantations and magic as part of treatment.|$|E
25|$|While {{the concept}} of Heaven (malkuth hashamaim מלכות השמים, the Kingdom of Heaven) is much {{discussed}} within the Christian and Islamic religions, the Jewish concept of the afterlife, sometimes known as olam haba, the World-to-come, is not discussed <b>so</b> <b>often.</b> <b>The</b> Torah has little {{to say on the}} subject of survival after death, but {{by the time of the}} rabbis two ideas had made inroads among the Jews: one, which is probably derived from Greek thought, is that of the immortal soul which returns to its creator after death; the other, which is thought to be of Persian origin, is that of resurrection of the dead.|$|E
25|$|Territorial {{males of}} this species perch upon {{prominent}} vegetation at high elevation (1500m or higher) and chase intruders away. There is never more than one individual in each territory {{for more than a}} few minutes. Every <b>so</b> <b>often,</b> <b>the</b> landowning male wasp will make short regular flights out from its perch. Intruding visitors are common among this species, as males jockey for the best territory. On occasion, the intruder engages in aerial combat with the territory owner over possession of the perch, a tree or bush. The two males will clash wings and spiral vertically upwards engaging in an aerial contest for the territory.|$|E

25|$|The name, Pitmilly or Pitmillie, {{has been}} used for centuries, but many {{variants}} occurred in earlier times. These include Petmullin, Pitmulin, Pethmolyn, and Pitmaulin. They probably reflect the P-Celtic, Scottish Gaelic, Scots and Latin languages, coupled with no great desire for consistency in spelling and the modification of place names that occurs <b>so</b> <b>often.</b> <b>The</b> prefix pit is derived from the P-Celtic word, pett, meaning a piece of land, and is very common in place-names in this part of Scotland. The second part of the name means mill, regardless of its various forms. Pitmilly means, therefore, a piece of land by the mill(s), and indeed, there are still ruined mills at Pitmilly.|$|E
25|$|The Copeland House is {{an example}} of Wright's {{remodeling}} design work. It is listed as a contributing property to the Frank Lloyd Wright-Prairie School of Architecture Historic District. The historic district joined the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The William Copeland House is one of three homes in Oak Park that Wright was commissioned to remodel. The other two are the 1906 Peter A. Beachy House and the Hills-DeCaro House, also on Forest Avenue. Wright also added a large brick fireplace to the library. However, as was <b>so</b> <b>often</b> <b>the,</b> (as evidenced by the sagging cantilevers at Falling Water and the sagging second floor of the Heurtley House) Wright's use of available materials exceeded their structural capacity. The mantle of the fireplace is a large stone that cracked {{under the weight of the}} bricks, as did steps in the front stairway. The center wall of the coach house also sank due to inadequacy of the center foundation.|$|E

Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone Magazine, in {{his review}} of the album, wrote: [...] "The fantastic piano ballad 'The Scientist'... a cataclysmic falsetto finale that could raise every {{hair on the back}} of your neck." [...] Nick Southall of Stylus magazine wrote: [...] "The piano that chimes through 'The Scientist' is captured perfectly, the warm depression of each individual key caught rather than a shrill ringing as is <b>so</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> case." [...] Ian Watson of NME wrote: [...] "'The Scientist' is a song inexorably linked with the endless night sky and the secret hopes and regrets of a hundred thousand strangers." ...|$|E

500|$|The game {{follows a}} {{branching}} plot line through eight chapters with five possible endings, {{and depending on}} the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. Every <b>so</b> <b>often,</b> <b>the</b> player will come {{to a point where}} he or she is given the chance to choose from multiple options. Text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. Sometimes during text progression, an [...] "active countdown" [...] minigame appears, which requires the player to press the game buttons in a specific order in a set time limit. Success or failure in these minigames influence which endings are viewed. During the turn-based battle sequences, the player assumes the role of Shana. The player uses a combination of fire, powers of unrestraint, and treasure tools to battle Crimson Denizens; and Shana is also able to use a special attack and defend.|$|E
500|$|... "The Man from Jupiter" [...] {{was widely}} lauded by {{television}} commentators. In his A- review, Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{felt that the}} episode contained many great moments and {{felt that it was}} a strong opening for the season. VanDerWerff wrote: [...] "Archer has always been a show I enjoyed more for the fast-paced dialogue and weird office plots, but every <b>so</b> <b>often,</b> <b>the</b> show does something pretty awesome, even on what's probably a fairly limited budget, and it turns out an action sequence that you just won't see on most other animated shows. FX has usually chosen to open seasons with these big action episodes, for fairly obvious reasons, and this one has the added benefit of Burt Reynolds hanging out as another potential ratings bump." [...] VanDerWerff noted that the storyline between Sterling Archer and his mother Malory Archer was the highlight of [...] "The Man from Jupiter"; [...] "Archer's so often at odds with her because he's unable to see her as a person and not just his mother, as Reynolds expresses while roaring down the highway at dangerously high speeds. Until Archer accepts that Malory has needs—some of them sexual—he’s always going to be trapped in a weird, co-dependent relationship with her. Archer isn't a show that tries to shove tons and tons of deep character moments into its episodes, which makes it all the better when it does do so. The show usually nails those little moments, and this was no exception." [...] Creative Loafing journalist Scott Harrel asserted, [...] "If the debut episode is any indication, you can expect another satisfying season from this intelligent, imaginative and button-pushing mix of high and low humor." [...] Ross Bonaime of Paste issued the installment an 8.8 out of ten rating, signifying a [...] "commendable" [...] rating. Bonaime affirmed that Reed adequately developed the characters, citing that [...] "The Man from Jupiter" [...] further established greater expectations for the series.|$|E
2500|$|As <b>so</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> case before, the {{editorial}} of the Jewish Chronicle captured {{the grave and}} foreboding mood of the moment.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1960s {{he began to}} {{incorporate}} contemporary soul and gospel phrasing into his music, still with a strong blues underlay, on albums such as Detroit and Hush'n'Thunder.

As is <b>so</b> <b>often</b> <b>the</b> case with such generalizations, {{the use of these}} terms do understate the breadth of his sound. For example, in the 1980s, Lateef experimented with new-age and spiritual elements.|$|E
