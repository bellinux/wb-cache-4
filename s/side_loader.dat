50|$|The WSI {{brand is}} a very big company for solid waste {{collection}} in Canada. The company predecessor was Capital Waste Services it was slowly absorbed into WSI just after the foundation of the company in 2001. The company has an enormous fleet of trucks in Canada and the U.S., the trucks are mostly front loader with some rear <b>loaders</b> and <b>side</b> <b>loaders</b> (mostly Labrie Expert 2000's). Today the company's website is still up but the company is defunct after merging in 2010.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two basic}} types: top-loading New England-style hot dog buns or lobster buns in some areas, and side-loading, common {{in the rest of}} the United States also called American Style Buns. The {{advantages}} to a top loader are that it holds the hot dog securely and fits nicely into little three-sided paper boxes. Top loaders are generally baked side by side and torn apart as needed, leaving a flat side surface for grilling; however it is debatable as to whether this is actually an advantage over the U-shaped underside (similar to a submarine hull) of <b>side</b> <b>loaders</b> which are able to fit snugly between grills, providing deep heating to the sausage.|$|R
5000|$|Lift-equipped {{trucks are}} {{referred}} to as automated side loaders, or ASL's. Similar to a front-end loader, the waste is compacted by an oscillating packer plate {{at the front of the}} loading hopper which forces the waste through an aperture into the main body and is therefore compacted towards the rear of the truck. [...] An Automated <b>Side</b> <b>Loader</b> only needs one operator, where a traditional rear load garbage truck may require two or three people, and has the additional advantage of reducing on the job injuries due to repetitive heavy lifting. Due to these advantages, ASL's have become more popular than traditional manual collection. Typically an Automated <b>Side</b> <b>Loader</b> uses standardized wheeled carts compatible with the truck's automated lift.|$|E
50|$|In Australia {{a modern}} similar type of bus or motorcoach, with two lateral doors for each row of seats, survived {{up to the}} 1970s and was {{referred}} to as <b>side</b> <b>loader</b> bus; but all or most of them were not open-topped. One such a bus based in Echuca Victoria has been restored and is used at the Port of Echuca on some public holidays and special events.|$|E
5000|$|Front loaders {{generally}} service {{commercial and}} industrial businesses using large waste containers with lids known as Dumpsters in the US. The truck is equipped with powered forks on the front which the driver carefully aligns with sleeves on the waste container using a joystick or a set of levers. The waste container is then lifted over the truck. Once {{it gets to the}} top the container is then flipped upside down and the waste or recyclable material is emptied into the vehicle's hopper. Once the waste is dumped, it is compacted by a hydraulically powered moving wall that oscillates backwards and forwards to push the waste {{to the rear of the}} vehicle. Most of the newer packing trucks have [...] "pack-on-the-go hydraulics" [...] which lets the driver pack loads while driving, allowing faster route times. [...] When the body is full, the compaction wall moves all the way to the rear of the body, ejecting it via an open tailgate. There is also a system called the Curotto Can which is an attachment for a front loader that has an automated arm that functions as an automated <b>side</b> <b>loader</b> that allows the driver to dump carts.|$|E

40|$|The present paper {{describes}} an innovative electro-hydraulic system developed for automated side loaders. The system {{is based on}} Intelligent Flow Control (IFC), a concept where open circuit electric displacement controlled pumps are coupled with EH directional control valves. IFC was selected {{in order to achieve}} the level of performance required, in terms of efficiency and productivity (i. e. cycle times), and also to provide the best possible control of the <b>side</b> <b>loader</b> arm. The paper describes the system layout and the basics of the controls: from the alghorithms of the arm actuators to the vehicle on board telemetry and diagnostic. The paper reports the comparison between the IFC system (implemented on the vehicle) and a more traditional approach based on a Load Sense Flow Sharing concept. The benefits of the IFC solution are highlighted focusing on the energy efficiency (very important {{especially in the case of}} CNG engines, where the torque available at idle is significantly lower than diesel engines), but also in terms of controlability and response (due to the lack of load sensing signal lines) ...|$|E
40|$|The study {{aim was to}} {{determine}} whether using automated <b>side</b> <b>loader</b> (ASL) trucks in higher proportions compared to other types of trucks for residential waste collection results in lower injury rates (from all causes). The primary hypothesis was that the risk of injury to workers was lower for those who work with ASL trucks than for workers who work with other types of trucks used in residential waste collection. To test this hypothesis, data were collected from one of the nation’s largest companies in the solid waste management industry. Different local operating units (i. e. facilities) in the company used different types of trucks to varying degrees, which created a special opportunity to examine refuse collection injuries and illnesses and the risk reduction potential of ASL trucks. ^ The study design was ecological and analyzed end-of-year data provided by the company for calendar year 2007. During 2007, there were a total of 345 facilities which provided residential services. Each facility represented one observation. ^ The dependent variable – injury and illness rate, was defined as a facility’s total case incidence rate (TCIR) recorded in accordance with federal OSHA requirements for the year 2007. The TCIR is the rate of total recordable injury and illness cases per 100 full-time workers. The independent variable, percent of ASL trucks, was calculated by dividing the number of ASL trucks {{by the total number of}} residential trucks at each facility. ^ Multiple linear regression models were estimated for the impact of the percent of ASL trucks on TCIR per facility. Adjusted analyses included three covariates: median number of hours worked per week for residential workers; median number of months of work experience for residential workers; and median age of residential workers. All analyses were performed with the statistical software, Stata IC (version 11. 0). ^ The analyses included three approaches to classifying exposure, percent of ASL trucks. The first approach included two levels of exposure: (1) 0...|$|E

40|$|AbstractImprovement of {{productivity}} {{has become an}} important goal for today's coal industry {{in the race to}} increase price competitiveness. The challenge now lying ahead for the coal industry is to identify areas of waste, meet the market price and maintain a healthy profit. The only way to achieve this is to reduce production costs by improving productivity, efficiency and the effectiveness of the equipment. This paper aims to identify the various factors and problems affecting the productivity of underground coal mines adopting the bord and pillar method of mining and to propose suitable measures for improving them. The various key factors affecting productivity, namely the cycle of operations, manpower deployment, machine efficiency, material handling and management of manpower are discussed. In addition, the problem of <b>side</b> discharge <b>loader</b> (SDL) cable handling resulting in the wastage of precious manpower resources and SDL breakdown have also been identified and resolved in this paper...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMOIL is {{producing}} annually around 1. 13 million tones of manganese ore. It operates 7 underground and 3 opencast mines {{in the state}} of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. The underground mines are operated at shallow to moderate depths. Asia's largest and oldest underground manganese mine is being operated by MOIL at Balaghat, Madhya Pradesh. Horizontal cut and fill mining with passive timber square set support has been replaced with advanced technique of pre-mining support by Cable bolting for reinforcement underground structures. The change in technology has enabled to transform the manual post filling of rock to hydraulic sand stowing operation in all the underground mines of the MOIL. With the available underground stopes, the panel working has been started with phased mechanization. The <b>Side</b> discharge <b>loaders</b> (SDL) has been introduced for mechanical handling of ROM in the stope and Load, haul and dump (LHD) machines for drivage development. These rapid mining operations have imposed the need for change in level interval for higher productivity. Presently below 12 th level, level interval has been changed from exiting 30 m to 45 m at Balaghat Mine. Moreover, Single boomer electro hydrostatic crawler mounted drill jumbo has been introduced for drivage development at Balaghat Mine. The paper describes the phased rock mechanics investigations and its application in the underground mining for mechanized stoping operations at Balaghat mine of MOIL for better safety and productivity...|$|R
50|$|The {{launcher}} {{was made}} in two parts that were joined in the middle, similar to the US 3.5” Rocket Launcher. It {{was designed to be}} fired by a soldier while prone. The weapon itself had a bipod similar to the one on the Type 99 LMG (Light Machine Gun). The gunner lay with his body at approximately a 45 degree angle to the bore on the left <b>side</b> while the <b>loader</b> was similarly positioned on the other side. The pistol grip and trigger mechanism were attached to the rear half of the launcher. A cable ran from the trigger {{to the rear of the}} launcher where the hammer was located. The hammer and firing pin was mounted on an arm. The arm was above the bore and out of the way of loading the rocket when it was in the cocked position. Pulling the trigger pulled the pin holding the arm in position and the arm swung around under spring pressure, striking the primer and igniting the rocket.|$|R
