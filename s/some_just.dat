5|$|However, {{during the}} 1980s, two Sun-observing {{satellites}} serendipitously discovered several {{new members of}} the Kreutz family, and since {{the launch of the}} SOHO Sun-observing satellite in 1995, it has been possible to observe comets very close to the Sun at any time of year. The satellite provides a constant view of the immediate solar vicinity, and SOHO has now discovered hundreds of new Sun-grazing comets, <b>some</b> <b>just</b> a few metres across. About 83% of the sungrazers found by SOHO are members of the Kreutz group, with the other being referred to as 'non-Kreutz' or 'sporadic' sungrazers (Meyer, Marsden, and Kracht1&2 families). On average, a new member of the Kreutz family is discovered every three days. Apart from Comet Lovejoy, none of the sungrazers seen by SOHO has survived its perihelion passage; some may have plunged into the Sun itself, but most are likely to have simply evaporated away completely.|$|E

25|$|After the war, {{the area}} {{west of the}} new eastern border of Germany was crowded with expellees, some of them living in camps, some looking for relatives, <b>some</b> <b>just</b> stranded. Between 16.5% and 19.3% of the total {{population}} were expellees in the Western occupation zones and 24.2% in the Soviet occupation zone. Expellees made up 45% of the population in Schleswig-Holstein and 40% in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern; similar percentages existed along the eastern border all the way to Bavaria, while in the westernmost German regions the numbers were significantly lower, especially in the French zone of occupation. Of the expellees initially stranded in East Germany, many migrated to West Germany, making up a disproportionally high number of post-war inner-German East-West migrants (close to one million of a three million total between 1949, when the West and East German states were created, and 1961, when the inner-German border was closed).|$|E

500|$|Before {{the book}} concludes, Gladwell {{writes about the}} unique roots of his Jamaican mother, Joyce, a {{descendant}} of African slaves. Joyce attended University College in London, where she met {{and fell in love}} with Graham Gladwell, a young mathematician. After moving together to Canada, Graham became a math professor and Joyce a writer and therapist. While Gladwell acknowledges his mother's ambition and intelligence, he also points out opportunities offered to his parents that helped them live a life better than those of other slave descendants in the West Indies. Gladwell also explains that, in the 18th century, a white plantation owner in Jamaica bought a female slave and made her his mistress. This act inadvertently saved the slave and her offspring from a life of brutal servitude. As one of the slave's descendants, this turn of luck led to Gladwell's relatively successful position in life. Summarizing the publication, Gladwell notes that success [...] "is not exceptional or mysterious. It is grounded in a web of advantages and inheritances, some deserved, some not, some earned, <b>some</b> <b>just</b> plain lucky", and at the end of the book, he remarks, [...] "Outliers wasn't intended as autobiography. But you could read it as an extended apology for my success." ...|$|E

[...] Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "It's beautiful to look at. The talking cars feel more alive than talking cars should." [...] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "Cars made me want to hop in my jalopy and to head out to Route 66, bypassing the boring interstate highways that made the Mother Road redundant." [...] Moira MacDonald of The Seattle Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Though the central idea of nostalgia for a quieter, small-town life may well be lost on this movie's young audience -- Cars finds a pleasant and often sparkling groove." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film two out of five stars, saying [...] "Cars might get us into car world as a gimmick, but it doesn't get us into car world as a state of mind. Thus, the animation, rather than seeming like an expression of the movie's deeper truth, becomes an impediment to it." [...] Derek Adams of Time Out gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "There are many other brilliant scenes, <b>some</b> <b>just</b> as funny but there are just as many occasions where you feel the film's struggling to fire on all cylinders. Still, it's a Pixar film, right? And they're always worth a gander no matter what anyone says." ...|$|E
