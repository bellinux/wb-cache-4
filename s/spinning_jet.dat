The fluid jet is studied under free fall and submerged discharge conditions. In the latter case, the jet was followed by dye-injection technique and image analyser was used {{to find out the}} effect of nozzle parameters on jet-spread angle, jet-discharge angle and the volume entrainment by the jet. All free-fall jets with nozzle port angle zero and upward are found to be spinning. Some of the free-fall jets with downward nozzle-port angle are found to be spinning and rest are smooth. The spinning direction of the jets are found to change with time. The well depth, port diameter and the inner diameter of the nozzle have a clear effect on the free-fall jets with downward port angle. The jet-spread angle is found to be about 17 -degrees for smooth jets. The spread angle for <b>spinning</b> <b>jet</b> increases as the nozzle-port angle is increased from downward 25 to upward 15 -degrees. The jet-discharge angle is always downward even when the nozzle-discharge ports are angled upward.

30|$|Surface {{tension is}} one of the most {{important}} parameters in the ejection of jets from the surface of polymeric solution. The lower the surface tension of the spinning solution, the stronger the force that prohibits <b>spinning</b> <b>jet</b> formation. After producing spinning solutions, it was specified that the 0.63  % w/w cellulose solution has less surface tension compared to the other spinning solution. The surface tension increases with the increasing cellulosic concentration. Results show negligible conductivity variation with changes in the cellulose content. In addition, the viscosity is an extremely influential parameter on electrospinning process which plays a vital role in determining the size and morphology of nanofibers during fiber spinning. The low viscosity causes inability to form continuous nanofibers; on the other hand, high viscosity causes hindrance to the ejection of jets from the spinneret surface. Hence, the viscosity optimization is critically important for efficient electrospinning [51]. Suitable viscosity for electrospinning solutions would be from 100 to 400  cp [52]. With the increasing cellulose concentration, the viscosity of cellulosic solution increases based on a quadratic (second-degree equation) model. According to these results, solution with 0.63  % w/w shows proper behavior for electrospinning compared to other solutions. However, the high surface tension and low conductivity make a powerful barrier against fiber jet formation. Hence, another strategy followed by adding Lithium chloride salt into cellulose/water solution.|$|E

This flexible 3 -D fibrous structure is ideal for packing into complex defects. It also has large inter-fiber spaces to promote vascularization, penetration of cells and transport of nutrients throughout the scaffold. The 3 -D fibrous structure was obtained by electrospinning, where the applied electric field and the instabilities exert tremendous force on the <b>spinning</b> <b>jet,</b> which is required to be viscoelastic to prevent jet break up. Previously, polymer binding agents were used with inorganic solutions to produce electrospun composite two-dimensional fibermats, requiring calcination to remove the polymer. This study presents novel reaction and processing conditions for producing a viscoelastic inorganic sol–gel solution that results in fibers by the entanglement of the intermolecularly overlapped nanosilica species in the solution, {{eliminating the need for}} a binder. Three-dimensional cotton-wool-like structures were only produced when solutions containing calcium nitrate were used, suggesting that the charge of the Ca 2 + ions had a significant effect. The resulting bioactive silica fibers had a narrow diameter range of 0. 5 – 2 μm and were nanoporous.

These precessing and <b>spinning</b> <b>jet</b> are originated by Inverse Compton and-or Synchrotron Radiation at pulsars or micro-quasars sources, by ultra-relativistic electrons. These Jets are most powerful at Supernova birth, blazing, once on axis, to us and flashing GRB detector. The trembling of the thin jet (spinning, precessing, bent by magnetic fields) explains naturally the observed erratic multi-explosive structure of different GRBs and its rare re-brightening. The jets are precessing (by binary companion or inner disk asymmetry) and decaying by power law on time scales to a few hours. GRB blazing occurs inside the observer cone of view only a seconds duration times; because relativistic synchrotron (or IC) laws the jet angle is thinner in gamma but wider in X band. Its apparent brightening is so well correlated with its hardness (The Amati correlation). This explain the wider and longer X GRB afterglow duration and the (not so much) rare presence of X-ray precursors well before the apparent main GRB explosion.

40|$|The present {{document}} {{summarizes the}} experimental {{efforts of a}} three-year study funded under the Laboratory Directed Research and Development program of Sandia National Laboratories. The Innovative Diagnostics LDRD project was designed to develop new measurement capabilities to examine the interaction of a propulsive <b>spin</b> <b>jet</b> in a transonic freestream for a model in a wind tunnel. The project motivation {{was the type of}} jet/fin interactions commonly occurring during deployment of weapon systems. In particular, the two phenomena of interest were the interaction of the propulsive <b>spin</b> <b>jet</b> with the freestream {{in the vicinity of the}} nozzle and the impact of the spin rocket plume and its vortices on the downstream fins. The main thrust of the technical developments was to incorporate small-size, Lagrangian sensors for pressure and roll-rate on a scale model and include data acquisition, transmission, and power circuitry onboard. FY 01 was the final year of the three-year LDRD project and the team accomplished much of the project goals including use of micron-scale pressure sensors, an onboard telemetry system for data acquisition and transfer, onboard jet exhaust, and roll-rate measurements. A new wind tunnel model was designed, fabricated, and tested for the program which incorporated the ability to house multiple MEMS-based pressure sensors, interchangeable vehicle fins with pressure instrumentation, an onboard multiple-channel telemetry data package, and a high-pressure jet exhaust simulating a spin rocket motor plume. Experiments were conducted for a variety of MEMS-based pressure sensors to determine performance and sensitivity in order to select pressure transducers for use. The data acquisition and analysis path was most successful by using multiple, 16 -channel data processors with telemetry capability to a receiver outside the wind tunnel. The development of the various instrumentation paths led to the fabrication and installation of a new wind tunnel model for baseline non-rotating experiments to validate the durability of the technologies and techniques. The program successfully investigated a wide variety of instrumentation and experimental techniques and ended with basic experiments for a non-rotating model with jet-on with the onboard jets operating and both rotating and non-rotating model conditions...|$|R

40|$|Every GRB model {{where the}} {{progenitor}} {{is assumed to}} be a highly relativistic hadronic jet whose pions, muons and electron pair secondaries are feeding the gamma jets engine, necessarily (except for very fine-tuned cases) leads to a high average neutrino over photon radiant exposure (radiance), a ratio well above unity, though the present observed average IceCube neutrino radiance is at most comparable to the gamma in the GRB one. Therefore no hadronic GRB, fireball or hadronic thin precessing jet, escaping exploding star in tunneled or penetrarting beam, can fit the actual observations. A new model is shown here, based on a purely electronic progenitor jet, fed by neutrons (and relics) stripped from a neutron star (NS) by tidal forces of a black hole or NS companion, showering into a gamma jet. Such thin precessing <b>spinning</b> <b>jets</b> explain unsolved puzzles such as the existence of the X-ray precursor in many GRBs.

40|$|A {{model for}} the {{relation}} between radio jet power and the product of central black hole (BH) mass and Eddington ratio of AGN is proposed, and the model is examined with data from the literature. We find that radio jet power positively correlates but not linearly with the product of BH mass (m in solar mass) and Eddington ratio (λ), and the power law indices (μ) are significantly less than unity for relatively low accretion (λ< 0. 1) AGN, P_j∝ (λ m) ^μ, in the radio galaxies and the Seyfert galaxies.

40|$|It has {{for long}} been {{an article of faith}} among astrophysicists that black hole spin energy is {{responsible}} for powering the relativistic jets seen in accreting black holes. Two recent advances have strengthened the case. First, numerical general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of accreting spinning black holes show that relativistic jets form spontaneously. In at least some cases, there is unambiguous evidence that much of the jet energy comes from the black hole, not the disk. Second, spin parameters of a number of accreting stellar-mass black holes have been measured.
