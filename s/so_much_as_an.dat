25|$|Part of this {{restructuring}} involves allowing {{men into}} the feminist movement, {{so that there}} is not a separationist ideology, <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> incorporating camaraderie. Additionally, she shows great appreciation for the movement away from feminist thought as led by bourgeois white women, and towards a multidimensional gathering of both genders to fight for the raising up of women. This shifts the original focus of feminism away from victimization, and towards harboring understanding, appreciation, and tolerance for all genders and sexes so that all are in control of their own destinies, uncontrolled by patriarchal, capitalist tyrants.|$|E
500|$|Ryan Bray, {{writer for}} Consequence of Sound, {{concluded}} So was an [...] "all-too-rare record that manages {{to have it}} both ways, earning its richly deserved critical and commercial respect without giving <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> artistic inch". He added that [...] "it still stands on its own two feet as one of the consensus best records of the 80s". Mark Blake of Q described the album as [...] "carbon-dated to 1986 thanks to those blaring saxes and Fairlight CMI digital sampling synths". He added that [...] "Gabriel crafted an album of user-friendly pop that was still reassuringly odd." [...] Terry Staunton of Classic Rock wrote [...] "Red Rain was familiarly pensive and politically charged, but the radio waves completely surrendered to the record's muscular dance rock and slower tempo eloquence." [...] Staunton concluded that Gabriel had displayed [...] "a masterful confidence, delivering a satisfyingly unified whole".|$|E

500|$|... "Time" [...] was {{received}} well online, with Cory Doctorow of Boing Boing {{saying it was}} [...] "coming along nicely" [...] during publishing with an [...] "astounding backstory" [...] upon its conclusion. Wireds Laura Hudson called the journey [...] "epic", and Glen Tickle of Geekosystem referred to the comic as Munroe's [...] "magnum opus". Tasha Robinson from The A.V. Club said of the comic, [...] "This is slow-paced entertainment for a fast-paced world, but it's also the kind of nifty experiment that keeps people coming back to XKCD, which at its best isn't a strip comic <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> idea factory and a shared experience." [...] "Time" [...] also got mentions from The Verge writer Jeff Blagdon and Washington Post blogger Andrea Peterson. In August 2014 the comic won the Hugo Award in the Best Graphic Story category.

2500|$|Bryan linked Darwinism {{to what he}} {{considered}} to be the might-makes-right philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche. [...] Bryan believed that such thinking served not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> explanation for injustice but more as an excuse for injustice, particularly in the areas of harming the weak and waging war. In contrast, Bryan was influenced by the social philosophy of Leo Tolstoy, Christian humanitarian and pacifist.|$|E

[...] Powell also refused to launch a public inquiry, resisted calls to issue a warning against any left-over thalidomide pills that might remain in people's medicine cabinets (as US President John F.

2500|$|In 1890, Native American {{historian}} Charles Alexander Eastman {{recorded his}} first meeting with Blue Horse at Pine Ridge Agency, South Dakota. Eastman reported Blue Horse was his “first caller” at the Pine Ridge Agency and Chief Emeritus of the Wágluȟe Band. “He softly opened the door and stepped in without knocking, in characteristic Indian fashion. After greeting me in Sioux, he promptly produced his credentials, which consisted of well-worn papers that had been given him by various high military officers, from General William Selby Harney to General George Crook, and were dated 1854 to 1877. The old man wanted nothing <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> audience, and the tales of his exploits served to pass the evening." [...] Eastman recorded that “Blue Horse had been, as he claimed, a friend to the white man, for {{he was one of the}} first Sioux U.S. Army Indian Scouts, and also one of the first to cross the ocean with Buffalo Bill." ...|$|E
2500|$|Grosvenor's major {{interest}} was in horse racing. [...] In 1875, {{he established a}} racing stable at Eaton, eventually employing 30grooms and boys, {{with two or three}} stallions and about 20breeding mares. [...] He regarded this, not <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> extravagance, but rather as an aristocratic duty. [...] He never gambled or placed a bet on any of his horses. [...] In 1880, one of his horses, Bend Or, ridden by Fred Archer, won the Derby, and he had more Derby successes in 1882, 1886, and 1899. [...] With his successes and sale of horses, it is considered possible that this enterprise was self-financing. [...] Grosvenor took an interest in the country pursuits of deer stalking and shooting, both in the Scottish Highlands and on his Cheshire estate and added to the family's art collection. [...] Grosvenor was teetotal and a supporter of temperance. [...] In his Mayfair estate he reduced the number of public houses and beerhouses from 47 to eight.|$|E
