5|$|Notts County's fate {{went in the}} {{opposite}} direction. They were relegated in bottom place the season after the 1996 play-off final defeat, only to win the 1997–98 Third Division title and gain instant promotion. However, they have <b>spent</b> <b>every</b> season since in the bottom two divisions. The two clubs did not meet again in league football until January 2008 after City's fall back down the league structure.|$|E
5|$|As Dean of Saint Patrick's Cathedral, Jonathan Swift <b>spent</b> <b>every</b> fifth Sunday preaching {{from the}} pulpit. Although {{many of his}} friends {{suggested}} that he should publish these sermons, Swift felt that he lacked the talent as a preacher to make his sermons worthy of publication. Instead, Swift spent his time working more on political works, such as Drapier's Letters, and justified this by his lacking in religions areas.|$|E
5|$|Finkelstein {{received}} his Master's degree {{in political science}} in 1980, and later his PhD in political studies, from Princeton. His doctoral thesis was on Zionism. Before gaining academic employment, Finkelstein was a part-time social worker with teenage dropouts in New York. He then taught successively at Rutgers University, New York University, Brooklyn College, and Hunter College and at DePaul University in Chicago. During the First Intifada, he <b>spent</b> <b>every</b> summer from 1988 in the West Bank, a guest of Palestinian families in Hebron and Beit Sahour.|$|E

The Rangers <b>spent</b> <b>every</b> day except one in first place for the division and ended the month of June tied with the Yankees for {{the best record in}} baseball.|$|E
25|$|According to Woolf's memoirs, {{her most}} vivid {{childhood}} memories were not of London but of St Ives, Cornwall, {{where the family}} <b>spent</b> <b>every</b> summer until 1895. The Stephens' summer home, Talland House, looked out over Porthminster Bay, and is still standing, though somewhat altered. Memories of these family holidays and impressions of the landscape, especially the Godrevy Lighthouse, informed the fiction Woolf wrote in later years, most notably To the Lighthouse. She describes why she felt so connected to Talland House in a diary entry dated March 22, 1921.|$|E
25|$|The use of German paratroopers in Rotterdam, where Fallschirmjäger {{landed in}} a {{football}} stadium and then hijacked private transport {{to make their way}} to the city centre, demonstrated that nowhere was safe. Worse still, the airborne abduction attempt on the Dutch royal family had failed only because the Dutch had possessed detailed plans of the operation well in advance. To counter the threat of an airborne assault, the Home Guard manned observation posts where soldiers <b>spent</b> <b>every</b> night until almost the end of the war continuously watching the skies, and initially armed with shotguns.|$|E
50|$|If {{expenses}} are $60 and revenue is $80 (perhaps net of interest revenue/expense) the efficiency ratio is 0.75 or 75% (60/80) - meaning that $0.75 are <b>spent</b> for <b>every</b> dollar earned in revenue.|$|R

25|$|Merman {{was born}} in her {{maternal}} grandmother's house located at 359 4th Avenue in Astoria, Queens in New York City in 1908, though she would later emphatically insist that it was actually 1912. Her father, Edward Zimmermann (1879–1977), was an accountant with James H. Dunham & Company, a Manhattan wholesale dry-goods company, and her mother, Agnes (Gardner) Zimmermann (1883–1974), was a teacher. Edward Zimmermann had been raised in the Dutch Reformed Church and his wife was Presbyterian. Shortly after they married, they joined the Episcopal congregation at Church of the Redeemer, where their daughter was baptized. Her parents were strict about church attendance, and she <b>spent</b> <b>every</b> Sunday there, at morning services, followed by Sunday school, an afternoon prayer meeting, and an evening study group for children. Her family was of German and Scottish ancestry.|$|E
25|$|In January 1886, the Duke was {{appointed}} commander-in-chief of the British Mediterranean Fleet, based in Malta. In October 1886, the family settled there. For {{the next three}} years, they <b>spent</b> <b>every</b> winter at the San Anton Palace in Malta. Life in the island was unexciting for the Duchess of Edinburgh, {{but it was a}} welcome respite from living in England. While in Malta, the Duchess proved to be an excellent hostess, entertaining naval officers and their wives. In 1887, the couple returned briefly to London to take part in Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. Her husband's career in the British navy and their many relations in the European courts allowed Maria Alexandrovna to travel extensively, something that she truly enjoyed. She visited most European countries, including Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Greece, and even Montenegro, making annual trips to Germany, England, and Russia.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{his more}} notable oddities {{included}} a diet to supplement his extreme fitness regime, which consisted largely of tea, biscuits, and baked beans. Like his mentor, Alan Knott, a heavy tea drinker, Russell would often get through 20 cups a day. He used to dip the tea bag in once, add plenty of milk, then hang it on a nail ready for subsequent use. In the final Test of the 1989 Ashes series (against Australia) at the Oval, Derek Randall counted that he used the same bag for all five days, which roughly equates to 100 cups. For lunch, Russell would eat two Weetabix, soaked for exactly eight minutes in milk, and a mashed banana. For dinner, steak and chips or chicken without skin was a favourite meal – Russell once <b>spent</b> <b>every</b> night of a Test at a Chinese restaurant in Perth, ordering cashew chicken: without the cashews.|$|E

25|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{military}} {{burden on the}} socii, though heavy, amounted to only around half that on Roman citizens, since the socii population outnumbered the Romans by roughly two to one, but normally provided roughly {{the same number of}} troops to the confederate levy. During the Samnite Wars, the burden on Romans was extremely onerous. The standard levy was raised from two to four legions and military operations took place every single year. This implies that c. 16% of all Roman adult males <b>spent</b> <b>every</b> campaigning season under arms in this period, rising to 25% during emergencies. Nevertheless, the socii were allowed to share the spoils of war, the main remuneration of Republican levy soldiers (since pay was minimal), on an equal basis with Roman citizens. This allowed socii soldiers to return {{home at the end of}} each campaigning season with substantial capital and was important in reconciling the socii to service outside Italy, especially in the 2nd century BC.|$|E
500|$|The Simpsons {{have dinner}} with Selma and her new boyfriend, Sideshow Bob, Bart's arch-enemy. According to Sideshow Bob, {{while he was in}} prison he <b>spent</b> <b>every</b> moment {{planning}} his revenge on Bart for exposing his plan to frame Krusty the Clown; after receiving Selma's response to his [...] "Prison Pen Pal" [...] ad, he was inspired to become a model prisoner and earned an early release.|$|E

He opened an exploratory committee on November 16, 2006 to test the waters, stating that [...] "The times are right for my ideas." [...] He hired Rodman P. Hise as the treasurer of the committee, and gained the assistance of former advisers from his previous campaigns, including fundraiser Phil Prange, and former press secretary Darrin Schmitz, who was eventually hired as political director. [...] A Washington Post-ABC News poll placed Thompson at 2% in December 2006. He fell to 1% in January 2007, but climbed back to 2% the following month.|$|E

500|$|In {{possession}} of these newly-bestowed honours, Luan Da <b>spent</b> <b>every</b> evening at home, attempting to summon spirits. According to the Shih ji, no spirits appeared, but only [...] "a multitude of ghosts who gathered around". These, the text claims, {{he was able}} to command. The Shih jis author, Sima Qian, was scornful of Luan Da, noting that [...] "Everyone on the seacoast of Yan and Qi began waving their arms about, declaring that they possessed secret arts and could summon spirits and immortal ones." [...] Indeed, Luan Da's dramatic growth in reputation and stature became a great topic of discussion in the Han capital of Chang'an, and mystics were eager to imitate his success.|$|E
500|$|It {{is known}} {{he was born in}} the fictitious Marin County town of Tewksbury, to parents Agnes (Rose Abdoo) and Jack Monk, Sr (Dan Hedaya). His parents were very strict and over-protective, {{although}} his mother was emotionally distant and seemed to have difficulty expressing affection. Adrian's father, Jack Monk, abandoned the family when Adrian was eight years old when he went out for Chinese food and did not return. Adrian has an agoraphobic brother named Ambrose (John Turturro), from whom he was estranged for seven years following Trudy's death. Monk states that his mother died in 1994. The episode [...] "Mr. Monk and the Marathon Man" [...] reveals that Monk ran track in high school, but quit when he entered college. The episode [...] "Mr. Monk and the Other Detective" [...] reveals that his alma mater is the University of California, Berkeley. In [...] "Mr. Monk and the Class Reunion", it is revealed that Monk had the nickname [...] "Captain Cool" [...] in college, and Natalie is amused to find that he got it from the fact he <b>spent</b> <b>every</b> weekend defrosting the student lounge refrigerator in his dormitory. His dorm room was number 303.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{revealed}} to Richie {{that he not}} only wanted to sing the song, but to participate in its writing as well. To begin with, [...] "We Are the World" [...] was to be written by Jackson, Richie, and Wonder. As Wonder had limited {{time to work on}} the project, Jackson and Richie proceeded to write [...] "We Are the World" [...] themselves. They began creating the song at Hayvenhurst, the Jackson family home in Encino. For a week, the two <b>spent</b> <b>every</b> night working on lyrics and melodies in the singer's bedroom. They knew that they wanted a song that would be easy to sing and memorable. The pair wanted to create an anthem. Jackson's older sister La Toya watched the two work on the song, and later contended that Richie only wrote a few lines for the track. She stated that her younger brother wrote 99 percent of the lyrics, [...] "but he's never felt it necessary to say that". La Toya further commented on the song's creation {{in an interview with the}} American celebrity news magazine People. [...] "I'd go into the room while they were writing and it would be very quiet, which is odd, since Michael's usually very cheery when he works. It was very emotional for them." ...|$|E
50|$|Puhtu was {{acquired}} by the professor of University of Hamburg biologist Jakob von Uexküll in 1927. 1929-1939 he <b>spent</b> nearly <b>every</b> summer some time in Puhtu.

2500|$|In the BBC science-fiction sitcom Red Dwarf, one of {{the main}} characters, Arnold Rimmer, tells of his family {{belonging}} to an obscure fundamentalist Christian sect, the [...] "Seventh Day Advent Hoppists". According to Rimmer – who is revealed in another episode to have the middle name Judas due to his parents' unconventional take on Christianity – the Hoppists' unique form of worship arose from a misprinted Bible wherein 1 Corinthians 13:13 reads [...] "Faith, hop and charity, and the greatest of these is hop." [...] The membership consequently <b>spent</b> <b>every</b> Sunday hopping. Rimmer says he never agreed with the faith, but claims to be liberal on religious matters.|$|E
