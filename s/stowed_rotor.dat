40|$|The {{results of}} a study of folding tilt rotor (<b>stowed</b> <b>rotor)</b> {{aircraft}} are presented. The effects of design cruise speed on the gross weight of a conceptual design <b>stowed</b> <b>rotor</b> aircraft are shown and a comparison is made with a conventional (non-folding) tilt rotor aircraft. A flight research <b>stowed</b> <b>rotor</b> design is presented. The program plans, including costs and schedules, are shown for the research aircraft development and a wind tunnel plan is presented for a full scale test of the aircraft...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} V/STOL {{aircraft}} designs pursued by industry from 1971 to 1978, {{with emphasis on}} the 1975 - 1978 period. Consideration is given to those designs pertaining to vertical-attitude and horizontal-attitude V/STOL types. These are divided into such concepts as tilting jet engine, lift/cruise engine, lift engine, lift/cruise fan, ejector augmentor, tilt rotor, <b>stowed</b> <b>rotor,</b> and rotor wing...|$|E
40|$|The AV- 95 Sun Devil must combine {{helicopter}} capabilities, such as vertical takeoff and landings (VTOL) and rotor-powered flight, {{along with}} long-duration cruise and high-speed dash capabilities unobtainable by conventional helicopters. To {{be able to}} perform both tasks, and perform them well, the AV- 95 Sun Devil design incorporates several unconventional devices; the AV- 95 uses two convertible turbofan engines, able to provide both shaft power for the main rotor and tall fan as well as jet thrust either separately or simultaneously. Other devices used for the AV- 95 include a variable diameter main rotor and a blown flap. In helicopter mode, the AV- 95 Sun Devil performs like a winged helicopter. The addition of wings to an attack helicopter results in two significant advantages. First, the addition of wings makes a helicopter more maneuverable than a wingless, but otherwise similar helicopter. Second, since the wings produce lift, rotor stall and compressibility effects can be significantly delayed at high tip velocities. In fixed-wing mode, the main rotor is completely off-loaded but slightly powered, and the rotor diameter has been minimized. The AV- 95 Sun Devil has many advantages over other VTOL aircraft. The conversion process is simple and fast; conversion does not make the AV- 95 vulnerable to enemy attack during conversion such as a tilt-wing or a tilt-rotor. Stop-rotor aircraft and a <b>stowed</b> <b>rotor</b> aircraft require heavy breaking of the rotor for conversion; this adds time for conversion and weight to the aircraft. Because the AV- 95 never stops the rotor in flight, much weight is spared, and conversion is much simpler and faster...|$|E
5000|$|The Flettner Fl 282A [...] "Kolibri" [...] reconnaissance-{{helicopter}} {{was also}} {{planned to be}} used from long range submarines.This single seat helicopter was manufactured of welded steel tubing and was sized {{so that it could}} be <b>stowed</b> with <b>rotor</b> blades and landing gear removed in a 5.9 ft diameter by 18 ft long pressured hangar on the U-boats deck. The Fl 282 [...] "Kolibri" [...] was never deployed on a German submarine.|$|R
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} design process started in 1935. The Experimental Development Section of the Bureau of Air Commerce contracted {{the building of}} a roadable aircraft based around an PA-22 autogyro from ACA's parent company, Pitcairn Autogiro Company. The vehicle could fly at high speed in the air, and drive at up to [...] on the ground with its <b>rotors</b> <b>stowed.</b> Six other companies were contracted to produce a roadable aircraft, but the AC-35 {{was the only one that}} met all the requirements.|$|R
