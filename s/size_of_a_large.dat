Star graphs are recognized as promising candidates for interconnection networks. This article addresses the <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>largest</b> connected component <b>of</b> <b>a</b> faulty star graph. We prove that, in an n-star graph (n >= 3) with up to 2 n- 4 faulty vertices, all fault-free vertices but at most two form a connected component. Moreover, all fault-free vertices but exactly two form a connected component if and only if the set of all faulty vertices is equal to the neighbourhood <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pair <b>of</b> fault-free adjacent vertices.
