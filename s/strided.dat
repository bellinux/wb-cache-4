40|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{statistical}} persistence in <b>stride</b> intervals characteristics exist during walking, running and cycling and were speed-dependent among healthy young adults. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if such statistical persistence in <b>stride</b> time interval, <b>stride</b> length and <b>stride</b> speed also exists during self-paced continuous stairmill climbing and if the strength is dependent on stepping rate. <b>Stride</b> time, <b>stride</b> length, and <b>stride</b> speed were collected from nine healthy participants during 3 min of stairmill climbing at 100, 110, and 120 % of their preferred stepping rate (PSR) and 5 min of treadmill walking at preferred walking speed (PWS). The amount of variability (assessed by standard deviation and coefficient of variation) and dynamics (assessed by detrended fluctuation analysis and sample entropy) of the <b>stride</b> time, <b>stride</b> length, and <b>stride</b> speed time series were investigated. The amounts of variability were significantly higher during stairmill climbing for the <b>stride</b> time, <b>stride</b> length, and <b>stride</b> speed and did only change with increased stepping rate for <b>stride</b> speed. In addition to a more irregular pattern during stairmill climbing, the detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) revealed that the <b>stride</b> length fluctuations were statistical anti-persistent for all subjects. On a group level both <b>stride</b> time and <b>stride</b> speed fluctuations were characterized by an uncorrelated pattern which was more irregular compared to that during treadmill walking.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{involvement}} {{of attention in}} {{the control of the}} walking-related rhythmic stepping mechanism remains unclear in contrast to control of balance phases in human walking. Concurrently to the dual-task related decrease in <b>stride</b> velocity, an increased stride-to-stride variability has been observed and interpreted as interference caused by competing demands for attention resources. It has been also shown that <b>stride</b> time variability depends on <b>stride</b> velocity, whereas the relationship between <b>stride</b> length variability and <b>stride</b> velocity remains controversial. It remains unknown whether dual-task related changes in <b>stride</b> time and <b>stride</b> length variability result from an effect of <b>stride</b> velocity and/or of the attention-demanding task. OBJECTIVE: To determine the respective roles of <b>stride</b> velocity and attention-demanding task on dual-task related changes in <b>stride</b> time and <b>stride</b> length variability. METHODS: Mean <b>stride</b> velocity, mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation of <b>stride</b> time and <b>stride</b> length were collected using the ambulatory device Physilog in 40 healthy young adults while walking at self-selected speed and while walking with enumerating animal names. RESULTS: Enumerating animal names while walking provoked significant changes in gait but not in cognitive task performance. Balanced analyses of covariance with a repeated measures design showed that <b>stride</b> time variability increased significantly under dual-task condition independently of dual-task related decrease in <b>stride</b> velocity, while <b>stride</b> length variability did not change under dual-task. CONCLUSION: These results show that the dual-task related increase in <b>stride</b> time variability depends on the attention-demanding task rather than <b>stride</b> velocity, suggesting that healthy young adults devote a part of their attention to the control of the rhythmic stepping mechanism at normal self-selected walking speed...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to {{investigate}} whether adaptations of <b>stride</b> length, <b>stride</b> frequency, and walking speed, independently influence local dynamic stability {{and the size of the}} medio-lateral and backward margins of stability during walking. Nine healthy subjects walked 25 trials on a treadmill at different combinations of <b>stride</b> frequency, <b>stride</b> length, and consequently at different walking speeds. Visual feedback about the required and the actual combination of <b>stride</b> frequency and <b>stride</b> length was given during the trials. Generalized Estimating Equations were used to investigate the independent contribution of <b>stride</b> length, <b>stride</b> frequency, and walking speed on the measures of gait stability. Increasing <b>stride</b> frequency was found to enhance medio-lateral margins of stability. Backward margins of stability became larger as <b>stride</b> length decreased or walking speed increased. For local dynamic stability no significant effects of <b>stride</b> frequency, <b>stride</b> length or walking speed were found. We conclude that adaptations in <b>stride</b> frequency, <b>stride</b> length and/or walking speed can result in an increase of the medio-lateral and backward margins of stability, while these adaptations do not seem to affect local dynamic stability. Gait training focusing on the observed stepping strategies to enhance margins of stability might be a useful contribution to programs aimed at fall prevention. © 2013 Hak et al...|$|R

40|$|Running {{speed is}} {{determined}} by <b>stride</b> frequency and <b>stride</b> length. As running speed is adjusted, runners make greater adjustments in <b>stride</b> length at slower speeds with a shift to <b>stride</b> frequency adjustments at the faster speeds. The relationship between <b>stride</b> frequency and <b>stride</b> length is largely based on overground research {{which leads to the}} purpose of this study to analyze whether the connection of <b>stride</b> frequency and <b>stride</b> length will adjust similar due to changes in running velocity during overground and treadmill running. The protocol was recently approved by The Institutional Review Board and data collection is currently in progress; - thus the following present abstract does not contain data.

Subjects will run at a variety of velocities overground and then on the treadmill with speeds ranging from slow, preferred, and fast. The main dependent variables will be <b>stride</b> frequency and <b>stride</b> length. The null hypothesis is: The relationship between <b>stride</b> length and <b>stride</b> frequency is similar while running overground and on a treadmill at different velocities. The results of this study will be helpful to runners as well as development of wearable technology used to quantify run metrics...|$|R

The resulting <b>stride</b> lengths represent the average <b>stride</b> length {{of each of}} the 9 user trials completed, calculated by the overall distance measured divided by number of steps detected, but not actually taken.

The personalized <b>stride</b> estimation generated 2.33 percent error, while the static <b>stride</b> estimation suffers 17.06 percent error.

A point of note is the extreme accuracy of the long <b>stride</b> under the personalized estimation scheme. The error bars are almost too small to be seen, averaging to 99.6 percent <b>stride</b> length accuracy for this <b>stride</b> type.

30|$|Kaneko et al. [166] {{suggested}} that the link between <b>stride</b> rate and economy {{may be associated with}} muscle fiber recruitment. At slower <b>stride</b> rates (and longer <b>stride</b> lengths), the muscles need to develop relatively high external power during propulsion to overcome large braking forces. Conversely at fast <b>strides</b> rates (short <b>stride</b> lengths), the mechanical power associated with moving the limbs increases due to increased frequency of reciprocal movements. They indicated that these extreme conditions may require a greater reliance on less economical Type II fibers than more intermediate <b>stride</b> rate/stride length combinations [166]. Consequently, efforts to improve RE via <b>stride</b> rate manipulation would be ineffective, unless the runner’s freely chosen <b>stride</b> rate is not economically optimal [69].
