5000|$|The {{knee jerk}} is the popularly known stretch reflex (involuntary kick {{of the lower}} leg) induced by tapping the knee with a rubber-headed hammer. The hammer strikes a tendon that inserts an {{extensor}} muscle {{in the front of}} the thigh into the lower leg. Tapping the tendon stretches the thigh muscle, which activates stretch receptors within the muscle called muscle spindles. Each muscle spindle consists of sensory nerve endings wrapped around special muscle fibers called spindle fibers (also called intrafusal fibers). Stretching a <b>spindle</b> <b>fiber</b> initiates a volley of impulses in the sensory neuron (a I-a neuron) attached to it.

40|$|The time {{course of}} {{chromosome}} movement and decay of half-spindle birefringence retardation in anaphase have been precisely determined in the endosperm cell {{of a plant}} Tilia americana and in the egg of an animal Asterias forbesi. For each species, the anaphase retardation decay rate constant and chromosome velocity are similar exponential functions of temperature. Over the temperature range at which these cells can complete anaphase, chromosome velocity and retardation rate constant yield a positive linear relationship when plotted against each other. At the higher temperatures where the chromosomes move faster, the spindle retardation decays faster, even though the absolute spindle retardation is greater. Chromosome velocity thus parallels the anaphase spindle retardation decay rate, or rate of spindle microtubule depolymerization, rather than absolute spindle retardation, or the amount of microtubules in the spindle. These observations suggest that a common mechanism exists for mitosis in plant and animal cells. The rate of anaphase chromosome movement is associated with an apparent first-order process of <b>spindle</b> <b>fiber</b> disassembly. This process irreversibly prevents <b>spindle</b> <b>fiber</b> subunits from participating in the polymerization equilibrium and removes microtubular subunits from chromosomal spindle fibers...|$|E

The actin in the spindle is confined to the fibers that connect the chromosomes with the centriolar region. Actin was not present in astral fibers, in the continuous <b>spindle</b> <b>fibers</b> that connect the poles, or in non-kinetochore regions of the chromosomes. The specific localization of actin in chromosomal <b>spindle</b> <b>fibers</b> suggests an actin-mvosin interaction as the force-producing mechanism for chromosomal movement...|$|R
40|$|Muscle spindle fibers are {{specialized}} stretch receptors {{that allow}} the perception and coordination of limb movement. Differentiation of muscle spindles is initiated by signals derived from the in growing Ia sensory neurons during development. The sensory neuron secretes neuregulin which binds and signals through the ErbB receptors to initiate a signaling cascade. This cascade results in {{the expression of a}} specific repertoire of genes, one of which is the transcription factor Egr 3, which is necessary in the development of muscle spindles. 	Signaling occurs efficiently when the postsynaptic receptors are clustered into large aggregates in apposition to an innervating nerve. Using what is known about acetylcholine receptor clustering at neuromuscular junctions as a model, this study shows the importance of the basal lamina proteins agrin and laminin and their shared receptor α-dystroglycan in aggregating ErbB receptors at sensory synapses. The study also shows that signaling through these receptors subsequently results in increased expression of Egr 3, the transcription factor critical to muscle <b>spindle</b> <b>fiber</b> differentiation. Using an α-dystroglycan silenced culture, it is shown that α-dystroglycan is necessary to induce neuregulin, laminin and agrin induced Egr 3. In these same myotube cultures there is also a reduced number of AChR-ErbB 3 colocalized aggregates and this is not rescued with the addition of laminin. Taken together, these results suggest an essential role for basal lamina components and α-dystroglycan, molecules that are crucial in acetylcholine receptor aggregation at neuromuscular junctions, in the induction of the transcription factor Egr 3, a critical transcription factor involved in muscle <b>spindle</b> <b>fiber</b> differentiation. 1 yea...|$|E

This technique routinely yields excellent quality cells, predominantly in prometaphase and prophase. Among other differences with the standard technique, this addltion does not use Colcemid, which, in addltion to Inhibiting <b>spindle</b> <b>fiber</b> formation, also increases chromosome contraction resulting in thicker and thus fewer bands. Consequently, horse prometaphase chromosomes, which have incorporated BrdU in the late-S-phase, are very long and display {{a large number of}} R-bands after the fluorescence-photolysis Glemsa method.

A differentiated region on the continuous spindle fibers, consisting of a localized increase in density, is observed at the equatorial plane. The mid-body seems to develop by the aggregation of such denser lengths of <b>spindle</b> <b>fiber.</b> Its appearance precedes that of the cleavage furrow. A plate-like arrangement of fibrillary material lies transversely across the telophase intercellular bridge. Later, this material becomes amorphous and assumes {{the form of a}} dense ring closely applied to a ridge in the plasma membrane encircling the middle of the bridge.

40|$|Irradiation of the {{mitotic spindle}} in living Nephrotoma suturalis (Loew) spermatocytes with an {{ultraviolet}} microbeam of controlled dose produced a localized area of reduced birefringence in the <b>spindle</b> <b>fibers.</b> The birefringence was reduced {{only at the}} site irradiated, and only on the <b>spindle</b> <b>fibers</b> irradiated. Areas of reduced birefringence, whether produced during metaphase or during anaphase, immediately began {{to move toward the}} pole {{in the direction of the}} chromosomal fiber, even though the associated chromosomes did not necessarily move poleward. Both the poleward and the chromosomal sides of the area of reduced birefringence on each chromosomal fiber moved poleward with about the same, constant, velocity. On the average, the areas of reduced birefringence moved poleward with about the same velocities as did the chromosomes during anaphase. The area of reduced birefringence was interpreted as a region in which most, though not necessarily all, of the previously oriented material was disoriented by the irradiation. The poleward movement of the areas of reduced birefringence indicates that the <b>spindle</b> <b>fibers</b> are not static, nonchangeable structures. The poleward movement possibly represents the manner in which the birefringent <b>spindle</b> <b>fibers</b> normally become organized. All the experiments reported were on primary spermatocytes which completed the second meiotic division subsequent to the experimentation.

40|$|Evidence {{from light}} {{microscopy}} (principally polarization microscopy) {{has demonstrated that}} hydrostatic pressure can reversibly inhibit mitosis by rapidly depolymerizing the <b>spindle</b> <b>fiber</b> microtubules. We have confirmed this finding in ultrastructural studies of mitotic HeLa cells incubated at 37 ~C and pressurized at 680 atm (10, 000 psi). Although there are many spindle microtubules in the cells at atmospheric pressure, electron micrographs of cells pressurized for 10 min (and fixed while under pressure in a Landau-Thibodeau chamber) show few microtubules. Pressure has a differential effect on {{the various types of}} spindle microtubules. Astral and interpolar MTs appear to be completely depolymerized in pressurized cells, but occasional groups of kinetochore fiber microtubules are seen. Surprisingly, the length and density of microtubules of the stem bodies and midbody of telophase cells appear unchanged by pressurization. In cells fixed 10 min after pressure was released, microtubules were again abundant, the density often appearing to be higher than in control cells. Reorganization seems incomplete...|$|E
40|$|Raf Kinase Inhibitor Protein (RKIP) {{has been}} {{identified}} as a phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein capable of inhibiting Raf- 1 kinase, an enzyme significant in cell proliferation and cancer development. When properly functioning, RKIP can mediate the expression of Raf- 1 kinase and help prevent uncontrolled cell division. RKIP also has suggested, but unclear, roles in <b>spindle</b> <b>fiber</b> formation during mitosis, regulation of apoptosis, and cell motility. The Fenteany laboratory in the Chemistry Department identified a new small molecule, named Locostatin, as a cell migration inhibitor in mammalian cells, with RKIP as its primary molecular target. Dictyostelium discoideum possess two RKIP proteins, RKIP-A and RKIP-B. In order to begin to study the function of RKIP in D. discoideum and its role in cell motility, I created a mutant cell line which lacks a functional RKIP-A gene. In this paper, we show that removal of RKIP-A does not affect vegetative motility, but impairs chemotaxis and development in the presence of drug. Interestingly, RKIP-A knockout mutants appear more resistant to drug effects on vegetative motility than wild-type cells. More research is needed to reconcile these seemingly contrasting results, and to better develop a model for RKIP-A’s role in cell motility...|$|E

40|$|We {{have known}} for decades that {{vertebrate}} kinetochores can nucleate microtubules. However, the role of such microtubules was unclear. Kitamura et al. investigated this issue by following a marked budding yeast centromere after its conditional reactivation to examine microtubule capture at unattached kinetochores. They found not only that yeast kinetochores can nucleate microtubules, but also that such microtubules facilitate attachment by decreasing the time required for spindle-pole-associated microtubules {{to make contact with}} unattached kinetochores. Historically, the fact that microtubules nucleated at kinetochores are opposite in polarity to those in mature spindle fibers was used to argue that they were not physiologically relevant for spindle assembly. Kitamura et al. have now shown that they, in fact, do play a role, and then rapidly depolymerize after <b>spindle</b> <b>fiber</b> attachments form. In sum, this paper provides a function for a previously mysterious microtubule population and outlines a surprising and dynamic mechanism through which kinetochore-originated microtubules assist spindle pole microtubules to efficiently “locate” unattached kinetochores. It also shows how this assistance mechanism is shut off to dim the “locator beacon” after correct attachments have been made.

One of methods to produce tetraploid bananas is inducing tetraploid plants usingchemicals that inhibit <b>spindle</b> <b>fiber</b> formation during mitosis such as oryzalin or colchicine. The present research is aimed toproduce and characterize tetraploid Pisang Mas Lumut (Musa acuminata, AAAA genome) induced by in-vitro oryzalintreatment from diploid Pisang Mas Lumut.

We investigated the occurrence of mitotic disturbances induced by asbestos (amosite, crocidolite, chrysotile) in an in vitro approach using Syrian hamster embryo (SHE) fibroblast cells. The following endpoints were investigated: micronucleus formation {{as a result of}} mitotic disturbances and characterization of the induced micronucleus population by kinetochore staining and visualization of the spindle apparatus. Supravital UV-microscopy was used to analyze changes in interphase chromatin structure, impaired chromatid separation, and blocked cytokinesis. All three asbestos fiber types induced a high frequency of micronucleus formation in SHE cells (> 200 / 2000 cells) in a dose-dependent manner (0. 1 - 5. 0 micrograms/cm 2), with a maximum between 48 hr and 66 hr exposure time. At higher concentrations (more than 5. 0 micrograms/cm 2) the micronucleus formation decreased again as a result of increased toxicity. Kinetochore staining of micronuclei revealed that 48 +/- 2 % of asbestos-induced micronuclei reacted positively with CREST (antikinetochore) serum. Furthermore, spindle apparatus deformations occurred in cells with disturbed metaphases and anaphases, while the <b>spindle</b> <b>fiber</b> morphology appeared unchanged.

40|$|G-quadruplex {{stabilizers}} such as telomestatin and HXDV bind with exquisite specificity to G-quadruplexes, {{but not to}} triplex, duplex, or single-stranded DNAs. Studies {{have suggested}} that the antiproliferative and possibly anti-tumor activities of these compounds are linked to their inhibitory effect on telomerase and/or telomere function. In the current studies, we show that HXDV, a synthetic analog of telomestatin, exhibits antiproliferative activity against both telomerase-positive and -negative cells and induces robust apoptosis within 16 h of treatment, suggesting a mode of action independent of telomerase. HXDV was also shown to inhibit cell cycle progression causing M-phase cell cycle arrest, as evidenced by accumulation of cells with 4 n DNA content, increased mitotic index, separated centrosomes, elevated histone H 3 phosphorylation at Ser- 10 (an M-phase marker), and defective chromosome alignment and <b>spindle</b> <b>fiber</b> assembly (revealed by time-lapse microscopy). The M-phase arrest caused by HXDV paralleled with reduction in the expression level of the major M-phase checkpoint regulator Aurora A. All these cellular effects appear to depend on the G-quadruplex binding activity of HXDV as its non-G-quadruplex binding analog, TXTLeu, is completely devoid of all these effects. In the aggregate, our results suggest that HXDV, which exhibits anti-proliferative and apoptotic activities, is also a novel M-phase blocker, with a mode of action dependent on its G-quadruplex binding activity...|$|E

These {{results are consistent with}} studies demonstrating that yeast cells contain sequence-specific centromere DNA-binding proteins. Our in vivo experiments on chromosomes with mutant centromeres show that some mutations which affect chromosome segregation also alter the footprint pattern caused by proteins bound to the centromere DNA. The results of this study provide the first fine-structure map of proteins bound to centromere DNA in living yeast cells and suggest a direct correlation between these protein-DNA interactions and centromere function.

An {{integral part of}} synapse formation, we have analyzed NRG-induced changes in gene expression over 48 h in primary human myotubes. We show {{that in addition to}} increasing the expression of acetylcholine receptors on the myotube surface, NRG treatment results in a transient increase of several members of the early growth response (Egr) family of transcription factors. Three Egrs, Egr 1, - 2, and - 3, are induced within the first hour of NRG treatment, with Egr 1 and - 3 RNA levels showing the most significant increases of ≈ 9 - and 16 -fold, respectively. Also noted was a corresponding increase in protein levels for both of these transcription factors. Previous literature indicates that Egr 3 expression is required for the formation of muscle spindle fibers, sensory organs that are distinct from skeletal muscle contractile fibers. At the molecular level, muscle spindle fibers express a unique subset of myosin heavy chains. Two isoforms of the myosin heavy chain, the slow development and neonatal, were found to be increased in our myotube cultures after 48 h of treatment with NRG.
