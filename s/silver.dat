5|$|Photochromic lenses include <b>silver</b> halides, so that {{ultraviolet}} light in natural daylight liberates metallic <b>silver,</b> darkening the lenses. The <b>silver</b> halides are reformed in lower light intensities. Colourless <b>silver</b> chloride films {{are used in}} radiation detectors. Zeolite sieves incorporating Ag+ ions are used to desalinate seawater during rescues, using <b>silver</b> ions to precipitate chloride as <b>silver</b> chloride. <b>Silver</b> is also used for its antibacterial properties for water sanitisation, but the application of this is limited by limits on <b>silver</b> consumption. Colloidal <b>silver</b> is similarly used to disinfect closed swimming pools; while it {{has the advantage of}} not giving off a smell like hypochlorite treatments do, colloidal <b>silver</b> is not effective enough for more contaminated open swimming pools. Small <b>silver</b> iodide crystals are used in cloud seeding to cause rain.|$|E
5|$|<b>Silver</b> {{compounds}} {{have low}} toxicity {{compared to those}} of most other heavy metals, as they are poorly absorbed by the human body when digested, and that which does get absorbed is rapidly converted to insoluble <b>silver</b> compounds or complexed by metallothionein. However, <b>silver</b> fluoride and <b>silver</b> nitrate are caustic and can cause tissue damage, resulting in gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, falling blood pressure, cramps, paralysis, and respiratory arrest. Animals repeatedly dosed with <b>silver</b> salts have been observed to experience anaemia, slowed growth, necrosis of the liver, and fatty degeneration of the liver and kidneys; rats implanted with <b>silver</b> foil or injected with colloidal <b>silver</b> have been observed to develop localised tumours. Parenterally admistered colloidal <b>silver</b> causes acute <b>silver</b> poisoning. Some waterborne species are particularly sensitive to <b>silver</b> salts {{and those of the}} other precious metals; in most situations, however, <b>silver</b> does not pose serious environmental hazards.|$|E
5|$|<b>Silver</b> fulminate, AgCNO, a powerful, touch-sensitive {{explosive}} used in percussion caps, {{is made by}} {{reaction of}} <b>silver</b> metal with nitric acid {{in the presence of}} ethanol. Other dangerously explosive <b>silver</b> compounds are <b>silver</b> azide, AgN3, formed by reaction of <b>silver</b> nitrate with sodium azide, and <b>silver</b> acetylide, Ag2C2, formed when <b>silver</b> reacts with acetylene gas in ammonia solution. In its most characteristic reaction, <b>silver</b> azide decomposes explosively, releasing nitrogen gas: given the photosensitivity of <b>silver</b> salts, this behaviour may be induced by shining a light on its crystals.|$|E

5|$|Some <b>silver</b> {{compounds}} {{are very}} explosive, {{such as the}} nitrogen compounds <b>silver</b> azide, <b>silver</b> amide, and <b>silver</b> fulminate, as well as <b>silver</b> acetylide, <b>silver</b> oxalate, and silver(II) oxide. They can explode on heating, force, drying, illumination, or sometimes spontaneously. To avoid the formation of such compounds, ammonia and acetylene should be kept away from <b>silver</b> equipment. Salts of <b>silver</b> with strongly oxidising acids such as <b>silver</b> chlorate and <b>silver</b> nitrate can explode on contact with materials that can be readily oxidised, such as organic compounds, sulfur and soot.|$|E

5|$|A <b>silver</b> boom {{occurred}} in England after {{the discovery of}} <b>silver</b> near Carlisle in 1133. Huge quantities of <b>silver</b> were produced from a semicircle of mines reaching across Cumberland, Durham and Northumberland – up to three to four tonnes of <b>silver</b> were mined each year, more than ten times the previous annual production across the whole of Europe. The result was a local economic boom and a major uplift to 12th-century royal finances. Tin mining was centred in Cornwall and Devon, exploiting alluvial deposits and governed by the special Stannary Courts and Parliaments. Tin formed a valuable export good, initially to Germany and then later in the 14th century to the Low Countries. Lead was usually mined as a by-product of mining for <b>silver,</b> with mines in Yorkshire, Durham and the north, {{as well as in}} Devon. Economically fragile, the lead mines usually survived as a result of being subsidised by <b>silver</b> production.|$|E

5|$|A {{total of}} 609 medals (202 gold, 199 <b>silver</b> and 208 bronze) were awarded. The {{total number of}} bronze medals {{is greater than the}} total number of gold or <b>silver</b> medals because two bronze medals were awarded per event in boxing (except men's light heavyweight and heavyweight categories). In +100kg {{category}} of freestyle wrestling, a tie for the first position in between the wrestlers of Iran and Japan meant that no <b>silver</b> medal was awarded. In gymnastics, a tie for second place in the parallel bars event resulted in two <b>silver</b> medals and thus no bronze was awarded, similarly a tie for first place in the uneven bars event meant that no <b>silver</b> medal was awarded.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of a report written by Newton on 21 September 1717 to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury the {{bimetallic}} relationship between gold coins and <b>silver</b> coins was changed by Royal proclamation on 22 December 1717, forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21 <b>silver</b> shillings. This inadvertently resulted in a <b>silver</b> shortage as <b>silver</b> coins were used to pay for imports, while exports were paid for in gold, effectively moving Britain from the <b>silver</b> standard to its first gold standard. It is a matter of debate as whether he intended to do this or not. It has been argued that Newton conceived of his work at the Mint as a continuation of his alchemical work.|$|E

5|$|Because pure <b>silver</b> is very soft, most <b>silver</b> {{used for}} these {{purposes}} is alloyed with copper, with finenesses of 925/1000, 835/1000, and 800/1000 being common. One drawback is the easy tarnishing of <b>silver</b> {{in the presence}} of hydrogen sulfide and its derivatives. Including precious metals such as palladium, platinum, and gold gives resistance to tarnishing but is quite costly; base metals like zinc, cadmium, silicon, and germanium do not totally prevent corrosion and tend to affect the lustre and colour of the alloy. Electrolytically refined pure <b>silver</b> plating is effective at increasing resistance to tarnishing. The usual solutions for restoring the lustre of tarnished <b>silver</b> are dipping baths that reduce the <b>silver</b> sulfide surface to metallic <b>silver,</b> and cleaning off the layer of tarnish with a paste; the latter approach also has the welcome side effect of polishing the <b>silver</b> concurrently.|$|E
5|$|Both Houses of Congress were majority-Republican, {{but their}} {{solutions}} differed. The House {{passed a bill}} in June 1890 requiring the government to purchase 4.5 million ounces of <b>silver</b> each month (in addition to the $2– $4 million required to be coined under Bland–Allison). The Senate passed a bill by Republican Preston B. Plumb of Kansas for free coinage of <b>silver</b> at the legal (16:1) ratio. Sherman voted against Plumb's bill, but {{was appointed to the}} conference committee to produce a compromise bill that, now called the Sherman <b>Silver</b> Purchase Act, passed that July. The Treasury would buy 4.5 million ounces of <b>silver</b> and would issue Treasury Notes to pay for it, which would be redeemable in gold or <b>silver.</b> The law also provided that the Treasury could coin more <b>silver</b> dollars if the Secretary believed it necessary to redeem the new notes. Sherman thought the bill was the least harmful option. Harrison believed it would end the controversy, and he signed it into law. The effect of the bill, however, was the increased depletion of the nation's gold supply.|$|E

25|$|<b>Silvers</b> {{was born}} in Mineola, New York, {{and grew up in}} Farmingdale and then Rockville Centre, New York, the son of James J. <b>Silvers</b> (1892–1986), a salesman, {{sometime}} farmer and small business owner, and Rose Roden <b>Silvers</b> (1895–1979), a music critic for The New York Globe {{and one of the first}} female radio hosts for RCA. He had one brother, Edwin D. <b>Silvers</b> (1927–2000), a civil engineer. His paternal grandparents were Romanian Jewish immigrants, and his maternal grandparents were Russian Jews. <b>Silvers</b> graduated from the University of Chicago in 1947 (at the age of 17) after completing an accelerated two-year program and attended Yale Law School for three semesters.|$|R
5|$|Central Europe {{became the}} centre of <b>silver</b> {{production}} during the Middle Ages, as the Mediterranean deposits exploited by the ancient civilisations had been exhausted. <b>Silver</b> mines were opened in Bohemia, Saxony, Erzgebirge, Alsace, the Lahn region, Siegerland, Silesia, Hungary, Norway, Steiermark, Salzburg, and the southern Black Forest. Most of these ores were quite rich in <b>silver</b> and could simply be separated by hand from the remaining rock and then smelted; some deposits of native <b>silver</b> were also encountered. Many of these mines were soon exhausted, {{but a few of}} them remained active until the Industrial Revolution, before which the world production of <b>silver</b> was around a meagre 50tonnes per year. In the Americas, high temperature silver-lead cupellation technology was developed by pre-Inca civilizations as early as AD 60–120; <b>silver</b> deposits in India, China, Japan, and pre-Columbian America continued to be mined during this time.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, the German {{government}} {{hoped to}} destabilize British rule over India by spreading {{rumors that the}} British were unable to redeem for <b>silver</b> all of the paper currency they had printed. These rumors, and hoarding of <b>silver,</b> caused the price of <b>silver</b> to rise and risked damaging the British war effort. The British turned to their war ally, the United States, asking to purchase <b>silver</b> to increase the supply and lower the price. In response, Congress passed the Pittman Act of April 23, 1918. This statute gave the United States authority to sell metal to the British government from up to 350,000,000 <b>silver</b> dollars at $1 per ounce of <b>silver</b> plus {{the value of the}} copper in the coins, and handling and transportation fees. Only 270,232,722 coins were melted for sale to the British, but this represented 47% of all Morgan dollars struck to that point. The Treasury was required by the terms of the Act to strike new <b>silver</b> dollars to replace the coins that were melted, and to strike them from <b>silver</b> purchased from American mining companies.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} years of the Wanli era and those of his two successors, an {{economic}} crisis developed that was centered on a sudden widespread lack of the empire's chief medium of exchange: <b>silver.</b> The Portuguese first established trade with China in 1516, trading Japanese <b>silver</b> for Chinese silk, and after some initial hostilities gained consent from the Ming court in 1557 to settle Macau as their permanent trade base in China. Their role in providing <b>silver</b> was gradually surpassed by the Spanish, while even the Dutch challenged them for control of this trade. Philip IV of Spain (reigned 1621–1665) began cracking down on illegal smuggling of <b>silver</b> from New Spain and Peru across the Pacific through the Philippines towards China, in favor of shipping American-mined <b>silver</b> through Spanish ports. In 1639 the new Tokugawa regime of Japan shut down most of its foreign trade with European powers, cutting off another source of <b>silver</b> coming into China. These events occurring at roughly the same time caused a dramatic spike in the value of <b>silver</b> and made paying taxes nearly impossible for most provinces. People began hoarding precious <b>silver</b> as there was progressively less of it, forcing the ratio of the value of copper to <b>silver</b> into a steep decline. In the 1630s a string of one thousand copper coins equaled an ounce of silver; by 1640 that sum could fetch half an ounce; and, by 1643 only one-third of an ounce. For peasants this meant economic disaster, since they paid taxes in <b>silver</b> while conducting local trade and crop sales in copper.|$|E
