Stalin shared information with Kosygin, {{such as how}} much money the families of Vyacheslav Molotov, Anastas Mikoyan, and Lazar Kaganovich possessed, <b>spent</b> <b>and</b> paid their staff.

5|$|By {{the end of}} the Marne-Rheims offensive, the German {{manpower}} advantage {{had been}} <b>spent</b> <b>and</b> their supplies and troops were exhausted. The Allied general, General Ferdinand Foch, ordered a counteroffensive which led to the Second Battle of the Marne, after which victory he was promoted to Marshal of France. The Germans, recognising their untenable position, withdrew from the Marne to the north. Foch now tried to move the Allies back onto the offensive.|$|E
5|$|Following a brief post-war downturn, boom times {{returned}} to Jerome in the 1920s. Copper prices rose to 24 {{cents a pound}} in 1929, and United Verde and UVX operated at near capacity. Wages rose, consumers <b>spent,</b> <b>and</b> the town's businesses—including five automobile dealerships—prospered. United Verde, seeking stable labor relations, added disability and life insurance benefits for its workers and built a baseball field, tennis courts, swimming pools, and a public park in Jerome. Both companies donated to the Jerome Public Library and helped finance projects for the town's schools, churches, and hospitals.|$|E

Funding of €91million was approved on November 20, 2006, consisting of a €58.8million loan from the World Bank, a €11.2million loan from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and a provision of €21million by Croatia.

5|$|In {{approximately}} 1200 a north aisle was added, {{with its}} width being {{determined by the}} projection of the north transept chapel, with the west and east walls taken down at the time.

5|$|The {{development}} of affordable, inexhaustible and clean solar energy technologies will have huge longer-term benefits.

These advantages are global. Hence the additional costs of the incentives for early deployment should be considered learning investments; they must be wisely <b>spent</b> <b>and</b> need to be widely shared.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1834, threepence (3d) {{pieces were}} struck for {{circulation}}, bearing the same design as the Maundy 3d. The circulation pieces were initially struck {{for use in}} the West Indies, but beginning in 1845, were coined for use in Britain as well. Many of the 3d pieces presented to impoverished Maundy recipients were <b>spent,</b> <b>and</b> these are rarer than the other values today. Maundy 3ds may sometimes be distinguished from currency 3ds as dies with a more polished field were used for the Maundy pieces. The design of the circulation 3d remained {{the same as that of}} the Maundy 3d until 1928, when a new design was introduced for the circulating coins. Twopence coins identical to Maundy pieces, intended for colonial use, were struck in 1838, 1843, and 1848.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the money}} for the first phase of Device works came from Henry's {{dissolution}} of the monasteries a few years before, and the revenues that flowed in from the Court of Augmentations and First Fruits and Tenths as a result. In addition, the dissolution had released ample supplies of building materials as the monastic buildings were pulled down, and much of this was recycled. Netley Castle, for example, was based on an old abbey and reused many of its stones, East Tilbury Blockhouse reused parts of St Margaret's Chantry, Calshot Castle took the lead from nearby Beaulieu Abbey, East and West Cowes castles stone from Beaulieu and Quarr, and Sandwich had the stone from the local Carmelite friary. Milton Blockhouse was constructed on land that had recently been confiscated from Milton Chantry. By {{the second phase of the}} programme, however, most {{of the money}} from the dissolution had been <b>spent,</b> <b>and</b> Henry instead had to borrow funds; government officials noted that at least £100,000 was needed for the work.|$|E

They also decided that no executive power existed over Australia, as although the sovereign monarch of Australia and the sovereign monarch of the United Kingdom are the same person, it had been accepted {{for a long time that}} the monarch acts in Australian matters on the advice of Australian ministers, and does not accept the advice of United Kingdom ministers in Australian matters at all.|$|E

5|$|The US forces made further {{attempts}} to secure Hill 206 on 13March, but several attacks were defeated after the American troops crested the South Knob. As casualties mounted, McCulloch resolved {{to abandon the}} direct approach, instead deciding that he would seek to wear down the defenders on the South Knob after patrols discovered that the Japanese had no reserves left to reinforce the position. From this it was assessed that their effort in the sector had been <b>spent</b> <b>and</b> {{regardless of whether they}} managed to hold the South Knob, they would be unable to exploit the position further. For their own part, the Japanese had also reached a similar conclusion and had begun transferring troops from this sector north to reinforce the Magata Unit around the northern perimeter in an effort to concentrate enough force in order to achieve a break in. Consequently, they had left only a small force on the South Knob. Over the following days this force was subjected to heavy bombardment and flame attacks, which lasted until the Japanese counterattack petered out on the northern perimeter and the Japanese withdrew from the position on 27March. Casualties in the Hill 206 sector amounted to 98 US servicemen killed, 24 missing, and 581 wounded. A total of 560 Japanese dead were found on top of the South Knob when the US forces reoccupied it on 28March.|$|E
5|$|Martin and {{the landlady}} at 3 Swaton Road, Elizabeth Haynes, {{described}} Bury as a violent drunk. On 7 April 1888, Haynes caught Bury kneeling on his bride of five days {{threatening to cut}} her throat with a knife. Haynes subsequently evicted them, and Ellen sold one of six £100 shares in a railway company that she had inherited from a maiden aunt, Margaret Barren, to pay William's debt to Martin. William was re-employed by Martin, and the couple moved to 11 Blackthorn Street, close to Swaton Road. According to Martin, William was then suffering from venereal disease. In June, Ellen sold the remaining shares, and in August they moved to 3 Spanby Road, adjacent to where William stabled his horse. With {{the money from the}} shares, the couple had a week's holiday in Wolverhampton with a drinking friend of William's and Ellen bought new jewellery. William continued to assault his wife throughout the latter half of 1888. By the first week of December, Ellen's windfall was nearly <b>spent,</b> <b>and</b> William sold his horse and cart. In January the following year, he told his landlord at 3 Spanby Road that he was thinking of emigrating to Brisbane, Australia, and asked him to make two wooden crates for the journey. Instead, William and Ellen moved to Dundee in Scotland. Ellen was not keen to go and only did so after William lied that he had obtained a position in a jute factory there.|$|E
