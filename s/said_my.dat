Bing Crosby - whose presence at a track guaranteed {{he would be}} met by song-publishers' touts offering him music - was said to pay the hospital bills of riders who fell. The actress Peggy Joyce - her wealth was such that Cole Porter wrote a lyric that <b>said</b> <b>My</b> string of Rolls-Royces, is longer than Peggy Joyce's - gave regular $200 bonus prizes, or primes. She was so delighted when a band in the track centre played Pretty Peggy with eyes of Blue that she put up $1,000.|$|E

500|$|Spin {{positioned}} it {{at number}} 46 {{on their list}} of the best 50 albums of 2013. They said, [...] "Push is in fighting form, incorporating a mature {{point of view on}} his drug-dealer past while rapping with the confidence of a man who knows the game is his to lose." [...] NME positioned it at number 48 on their list of the 50 best albums of year. They <b>said,</b> <b>My</b> Name Is My Name was the moment Clipse member Pusha T finally hit the home run he promised for so long. The beats snapped hard, the guests including Kendrick Lamar, Rick Ross and 2 Chainz glittered and the overall vibe was dirty but triumphant." [...] Paste ranked it number 34 on their list of the 50 best albums of 2013 saying, [...] "each bar has the ferociousness of a lion smelling the scent of fresh blood. Among his contemporaries, Pusha T is the sharp-witted wordsmith who makes you feel like you’re listening to a master at work, devilishly cooking up something as pure and addictive as he possibly can." [...] It was named the third best hip hop album of 2013 by PopMatters. They commented saying, [...] "My Name Is My Name is easily one of the most impressive displays of lyricism of the year and contains some of 2013's best verses, as Pusha shows off his versatility..... The production is minimalistic and intelligently doesn't overshadow Pusha's performance. The beats are big and full of bass, giving life to the album and forming a unique theme, with a reunion with Pharrell triggering a nice blast of nostalgia..... My Name Is My Name has substance, style, and passion, and no doubt is an album that will still be appreciated a decade from now. [...] " [...] Consequence of Sound positioned it at number 44 on their list of the 50 best albums of the year.|$|E

2500|$|Connecticut Republican {{voters were}} displeased {{to learn of}} McMahon's {{donations}} to Emanuel, a highly partisan figure who helped orchestrate the Democratic shift in the House in 2006 and Barack Obama's presidential win. McMahon explained to voters that her donations to Emanuel were on behalf of Rahm's brother, Ari Emanuel, who had represented WWE in Hollywood since 1992. According to McMahon, in 2002, [...] "He (Ari) called me one day and he <b>said,</b> <b>my</b> brother is running for Congress in Illinois. It happened to be Rahm. I didn't know Rahm." [...] McMahon made more donations {{over the course of}} the next several years, including one check she wrote when Rahm Emanuel came to WWE headquarters to meet her.

2500|$|Raja Petra {{was held}} without trial under the ISA at the Kamunting Detention Centre in {{northern}} Perak state, which had 60 ISA detainees, mostly suspected Islamic extremists. The ISA permits an initial detention of two months for investigation, {{followed by a}} two-year jail sentence which can be renewed indefinitely. The 1948 ISA is a holdover from British colonial rule, intended for use against communist insurgents. Raja Petra's wife Marina Lee Abdullah said: [...] "(Police) <b>said</b> <b>my</b> husband has been sent to Kamunting this morning {{and that he will}} remain there for two years with no trial. This is the worst news I can receive but we will keep fighting for his release. This is dirty foul play by the government as they know {{that we are in the}} process of fighting for his release in the court but I was expecting this. Raja Petra was detained for allegedly 'insulting Islam' and publishing articles on his website which has tarnished the country's leadership to the point of causing confusion among the people." [...] Raja Petra's lawyer sought his release in a court hearing but this was dismissed. Raja Petra's detention caused widespread protests by civil society groups, lawyers and other online commentators.|$|E
