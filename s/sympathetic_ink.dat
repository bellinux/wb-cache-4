60|$|Cavendish {{presently}} {{took his}} leave, {{and carried the}} unwilling Babington off with him, rightly divining that the family would wish to make their arrangements alone. To Richard's relief, Babington had brought him no private message, and to Cicely's disappointment, there was no addition in <b>sympathetic</b> <b>ink</b> to her letter, though she scorched the paper brown in trying to bring one out. The Scottish Queen was much too wary to waste and risk her secret expedients without necessity.|$|E

[...] You've heard what I confess: I don't unsay [...] A single word: I cheated when I could, [...] Rapped with my toe-joints, set sham hands at work, [...] Wrote down names weak in <b>sympathetic</b> <b>ink.</b> [...] Rubbed odic lights with ends of phosphor-match, [...] And all the rest; believe that: believe this, [...] By the same token, though {{it seem to}} set [...] The crooked {{straight}} again, unsay the said, [...] Stick up what I've knocked down; I can't help that, [...] It's truth! I somehow vomit truth to-day. [...] This trade of mine--I don't know, can't be sure [...] But {{there was something in}} it, tricks and all!" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{always had}} an inordinate passion for dress, and, as she was never thwarted in any whimsey she had of this kind (for I spared no money to gratify her, and among my debts are milliners' bills {{to the amount of}} many thousands), boxes used to pass {{continually}} to and fro from Dublin, with all sorts of dresses, caps, flounces, and furbelows, as her fancy dictated. With these would come letters from her milliner, in answer to numerous similar injunctions from my Lady; all of which passed through my hands, without the least suspicion, for some time. And yet in these very papers, by the easy means of <b>sympathetic</b> <b>ink,</b> were contained all her Ladyship's correspondence; and Heaven knows (for it was some time, as I have said, before I discovered the trick) what charges against me.|$|E
50|$|Hydrated cobalt(II) sulfate {{is used in}} the {{preparation}} of pigments, {{as well as in the}} manufacture of other cobalt salts. Cobalt pigment is used in porcelains and glass. Cobalt(II) sulfate is used in storage batteries and electroplating baths, <b>sympathetic</b> <b>inks,</b> and as an additive to soils and animal feeds. For these purposes, the cobalt sulfate is produced by treating cobalt oxide with sulfuric acid.|$|R

60|$|The {{whole book}} aims chiefly at {{satisfying}} {{the passion of}} curiosity. However unimportant a secret may be, it is pleasant to know what all Europe was once vainly anxious to discover. In the revelation of manners, too, and in tracing the relations of famous wits and beauties with a person then so celebrated as Prince Charles, {{there is a certain}} amount of entertainment which may excuse some labour of research. Our history is of next to no political value, but it revives as in a magic mirror somewhat dim, certain scenes of actual human life. Now and again the mist breaks, and real passionate faces, gestures of living men and women, are beheld in the clear- obscure. We see Lochgarry throw his dirk after his son, and pronounce his curse. We mark Pickle furtively scribbling after midnight in French inns. We note Charles hiding in the alcove of a lady's chamber in a convent. We admire the 'rich anger' of his Polish mistress, and the sullen rage of Lord Hyndford, baffled by 'the perfidious Court' of Frederick the Great. The old histories emerge into light, like the writing in <b>sympathetic</b> <b>ink</b> on the secret despatches of King James.|$|E
6000|$|Probably we do a {{good deal}} of {{reasoning}} in sleep. Professor Hilprecht, in 1882-83, was working at a translation of an inscription wherein came Nabu--Kudurru--usur, rendered by Professor Delitzsch [...] "Nebo protect my mortar-board". Professor Hilprecht accepted this, but woke one morning with his mind full of the thought that the words should be rendered [...] "Nebo protect my boundary," [...] which [...] "sounds a deal likelier," [...] and is now accepted. I myself, when working at the MSS. of the exiled Stuarts, was puzzled by the scorched appearance of the paper on which Prince Charlie's and the king's letters were often written and by the peculiarities of the ink. I woke one morning with a sudden flash of common-sense. <b>Sympathetic</b> <b>ink</b> had been used, and the papers had been toasted or treated with acids. This I had probably reasoned out in sleep, and, had I dreamed, my mind might have dramatised the idea. Old Mr. Edgar, the king's secretary, might have appeared and given me the explanation. Maury publishes tales in which a forgotten fact was revealed to him in a dream from the lips of a dream-character (Le Sommeil et les Reves, pp. 142-143. The curious may also consult, on all these things, The Philosophy of Mysticism, by Karl du Prel, translated by Mr. Massey. The Assyrian Priest is in Proceedings, S.P.R., vol. xii., p. 14).|$|E
60|$|What {{is really}} {{known of the}} {{movements}} of the Prince in 1749? Curiously enough, Mr. Ewald {{does not seem to have}} consulted the 'Stuart Papers' at Windsor, while the extracts in Browne's 'History of the Highland Clans' are meagre. To these papers then we turn for information. The most useful portions are NOT Charles's letters to James. These are brief and scanty. Thus he writes from Avignon (January 15, 1749), 'We are enjoying here the finest weather ever was seen.' He always remarks that his health 'is perfect.' He orders patterns for his servants' liveries and a button, blue and yellow, still remains in a letter from Edgar! The button outlasts the dynasty. Our intelligence must be extracted from ill-spelled, closely scrawled, and much erased sheets of brown paper, on which Charles has scribbled drafts for letters to his household, to Waters, his banker in Paris, to adherents in Paris or London, and to ladies. The notes are almost, and in places are quite, illegible. The Prince practised a disguised hand, and used pseudonyms instead of names. Many letters have been written in <b>sympathetic</b> <b>ink,</b> and then exposed to fire or the action of acids. However, something can be made out, but not why he concealed his movements even from his banker, even from his household, Oxburgh, Kelly, Harrington, and Graeme. It is certain that he started, with a marriage in his eye, from Avignon on February 28, 1749, accompanied by Henry Goring, of the Austrian service. There had already been a correspondence, vaguely hinted at by James's secretary, Edgar, between Charles and the Duke and a Princess of Hesse-Darmstadt. On February 24, 1749, Charles drafted, at Avignon, a proposal for the hand of the Duke's daughter. He also drafted (undated) a request to the King of Poland for leave to bring his wife, the Princess of Hesse-Darmstadt, into Polish territory. {69} We may imagine His Polish Majesty's answer. Of course, the marriage did not take place.|$|E
50|$|Giovanni Battista della Porta is {{credited}} with the first recipe for a <b>sympathetic</b> <b>ink,</b> derived from alum and vinegar, {{as well as the}} first book on secret writing and invisible inks, Magia Naturalis(1558, 1589). Since then, a wide variety of invisible inks have been used for all sorts of secretive purposes. A formula similar to oak gall ink was created by John Jay and used by George Washington and the Culper Spy Ring during the American Revolution and lemon juice was used by the Lemon Juice Spies during World War I.|$|E
