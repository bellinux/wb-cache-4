40|$|In {{the past}} decades, states have {{utilized}} weigh-in-motion (WIM) technology to reduce delay and increase enforcement of overweight vehicles. Usually a threshold value {{is used to}} filter and sort the trucks by weight. If the WIM reading of a truck is over the threshold, the truck {{would be sent to}} a static scale for further inspection. To fully utilize the WIM technology and enhance the operational efficiency at WIM sites, the authors devised a dynamic weight threshold (DWT) algorithm. The threshold value is increased when the queue at the weigh station is long so as to avoid the closure of the weigh station while still catch the worst weight limit offenders. The threshold value is lowered when the queue at the station is short to maximize the number of trucks inspected. This paper focuses on the evaluation of the design and operations of the dynamic weight threshold algorithm. A microscopic simulation model based on a real-world ramp WIM weigh station site was first developed and calibrated. Subsequently the dynamic threshold adjustment strategy was modeled and tested. The results show that under a wide range of conditions DWT algorithm always outperforms the traditional <b>static</b> threshold <b>operations.</b> Under heavy demand conditions, DWT catches 16 times more overweight trucks than the <b>static</b> <b>operations</b> while keeping the average delay per truck at only 30 % of the delay under <b>static</b> <b>operations.</b> In other words, DWT is both more effective in weight enforcement and more efficient for traffic flow...|$|R

This study investigates the hydroelectric supply of a one-reservoir system of Karoon 3 using nonlinear programming (NLP), genetic algorithm (GA), genetic programming (GP) and fixed length gen GP (FLGGP) in real-time operation of dam considering two approaches of static and dynamic operation rules. In <b>static</b> <b>operation</b> rule, only one rule curve is extracted for all months in a year whereas in dynamic operation rule, monthly rule curves (12 rules) are extracted for each month of a year. In addition, nonlinear decision rule (NLDR) curves are considered, and the total deficiency function as the target (objective) function {{have been used for}} evaluating the performance of each method and approach. Results show appropriate efficiency of GP and FLGGP methods in extracting operation rules in both approaches. Superiority of these methods to operation methods yielded by GA and NLP is 5 %.

40|$|International audienceIn {{ergonomics}} and biomechanics, {{muscle fatigue}} models based on maximum endurance time (MET) models {{are often used}} to integrate fatigue effect into ergonomic and biomechanical application. However, due to the empirical principle of those MET models, the disadvantages of this method are: 1) the MET models cannot reveal the muscle physiology background very well; 2) there is no general formation for those MET models to predict MET. In this paper, a theoretical MET model is extended from a simple muscle fatigue model with consideration of the external load and maximum voluntary contraction in passive static exertion cases. The universal availability of the extended MET model is analyzed in comparison to 24 existing empirical MET models. Using mathematical regression method, 21 of the 24 MET models have intraclass correlations over 0. 9, which means the extended MET model could replace the existing MET models in a general and computationally efficient way. In addition, an important parameter, fatigability (or fatigue resistance) of different muscle groups, could be calculated via the mathematical regression approach. Its mean value and its standard deviation are useful for predicting MET values of a given population during <b>static</b> <b>operations.</b> The possible reasons influencing the fatigue resistance were classified and discussed, {{and it is still}} a very challenging work to find out the quantitative relationship between the fatigue resistance and the influencing factors...|$|R
2500|$|The {{campaign}} season typically lasted through May to October; {{due to lack}} of fodder campaigns in winter were rare, but the French practice of storing food and provisions in magazines brought them considerable advantage, often enabling them to take to the field weeks before their foes. Nevertheless, military operations during the Nine Years' War did not produce decisive results. The war was dominated by what may be called 'positional warfare' – the construction, defence, and attack of fortresses and entrenched lines. Positional warfare played a wide variety of roles: fortresses controlled bridgeheads and passes, guarded supply routes, and served as storehouses and magazines. However, fortresses hampered the ability to follow success on the battlefield – defeated armies could flee to friendly fortifications, enabling them to recover and rebuild their numbers from less threatened fronts. Many lesser commanders welcomed these relatively predictable, <b>static</b> <b>operations</b> to mask their lack of military ability. As Daniel Defoe observed in 1697, [...] "Now it is frequent to have armies of 50,000 men of a side [...] spend the whole campaign in dodging – or, as it is genteelly called – observing one another, and then march off into winter quarters." [...] In fact, during the Nine Years' War field armies had waxed to nearly 100,000 men in 1695, the strain of which had reduced the Maritime Powers to a fiscal crisis while the French struggled under the weight of a shattered economy.|$|R
40|$|Object-Oriented Databases (OODBs) {{have gained}} wide {{attention}} {{in the past few}} decades because its greater modeling power on structurally complex data compared to relational database systems. These systems, benefited by the object-oriented approach, require also a high quality of performance on data manipula-tion. Indexing is one common technique to increase the performance of OODBs. Since most of these systems are static in nature, dynamic operations like class versioning and role-playing or intelligent operations like query relaxation and specification are not supported by traditional indexing schemes. In order to support these dynamic and intelligent query operations, a more sophisticated indexing scheme is needed. This thesis proposes the double signature indexing scheme (DSIS) for a dynamic object-oriented database programming language with role extension, called DOOR. The scheme supports retrievals of a large range of queries including class relation queries, nested queries as well as queries which only exist in dynamic environment like qualification and versioning queries. In this thesis, the types of queries supported by the indexing scheme are addressed. Besides, the index structure of the indexing scheme is described. The dynamic, intelligent as well as <b>static</b> <b>operations</b> which are supported by the indexing structure are also stated. In addition, the processes on how the new indexing mechanism handle different kinds of queries are demonstrated. The maintenance of the index structure in the dynamic environment is also presented.
