5|$|Mesoscale {{discussions are}} issued to provide {{information}} on certain individual regions where <b>severe</b> <b>weather</b> is becoming a threat and states whether a watch is likely and details thereof, particularly concerning conditions conducive {{for the development of}} severe thunderstorms in the short term, as well as situations of isolated <b>severe</b> <b>weather</b> when watches are not necessary. Watches are issued when forecasters are confident that <b>severe</b> <b>weather</b> will occur, and usually precede the onset of <b>severe</b> <b>weather</b> by one hour, although this sometimes varies depending on certain atmospheric conditions that may inhibit or accelerate convective development.|$|E
5|$|A {{major part}} of modern weather {{forecasting}} is the <b>severe</b> <b>weather</b> alerts and advisories that the national weather services issue in the case that severe or hazardous weather is expected. This is done to protect life and property. Some {{of the most commonly}} known of <b>severe</b> <b>weather</b> advisories are the severe thunderstorm and tornado warning, as well as the severe thunderstorm and tornado watch. Other forms of these advisories include winter weather, high wind, flood, tropical cyclone, and fog. <b>Severe</b> <b>weather</b> advisories and alerts are broadcast through the media, including radio, using emergency systems as the Emergency Alert System, which break into regular programming.|$|E
5|$|Local {{forecast}} {{offices of}} the National Weather Service, radio and television stations, and emergency planners often use the forecasts to gauge the potential <b>severe</b> <b>weather</b> threats to their areas. Even after the marginal and enhanced risk categories were added in October 2014, some television stations have continued to use the original three-category system to outline forecasted <b>severe</b> <b>weather</b> risks (though stations that do this may utilize in-house <b>severe</b> <b>weather</b> outlooks that vary to some degree from the SPC convective outlooks), while certain others that have switched to the current system {{have chosen not to}} outline marginal risk areas.|$|E

5|$|Day 4–8 outlooks are the longest-term {{official}} SPC Forecast Product, {{and often}} change significantly {{from day to}} day. This extended forecast for <b>severe</b> <b>weather</b> was an experimental product until March 22, 2007, when the Storm Prediction Center incorporated it as an official product. Areas are delineated in this forecast that have least a 15% or 30% chance of <b>severe</b> <b>weather</b> in the Day 4–8 period (equivalent to a slight risk and an enhanced risk, respectively); as forecaster confidence is not fully resolute on how <b>severe</b> <b>weather</b> will evolve more than three days out, the Day 4–8 outlook only outlines {{the areas in which}} severe thunderstorms are forecast to occur during the period at the 15% and 30% likelihood, and does not utilize other categorical risk areas or outline where general (non-severe) thunderstorm activity will occur.|$|E

5|$|In total, 56 <b>severe</b> <b>weather</b> watches {{were issued}} by the Storm Prediction Center (SPC) over those four days in the {{outbreak}} area, including 41 tornado watches (10 of which were PDS watches) and 15 severe thunderstorm watches.

5|$|On May 5, the SPC {{issued a}} high risk of <b>severe</b> <b>weather</b> for Central Kansas and central Nebraska, while {{moderate}} and slight risks for <b>severe</b> <b>weather</b> extended for areas far beyond. The low pressure system in place moved northward, but the extending front had barely moved. The storms were quick to develop. <b>Severe</b> <b>weather</b> reports were already coming in by late morning, and the first tornado reports came in during the early afternoon hours. The most intense activity took place during the late afternoon and evening hours as supercells developed along a long line from South Dakota to North Texas. Over 80 tornadoes were confirmed that day, along with hail as large as softballs and straightline winds as strong as 90mph (145km/h). The activity weakened in the late evening, but not before the last tornadoes were reported in Iowa in the overnight hours.|$|E

Pre-outbreak stands that were grown to 2013 in FVS sustained over 40 % BA mortality under moderate fire weather conditions, and resulted in a loss of all live BA under <b>severe</b> fire <b>weather</b> conditions. Torching indices were greater than moderate and <b>severe</b> fire <b>weather</b> condition wind speeds, indicating that torching is unlikely. Crowning indices were less than torching indices for pre-outbreak and outbreak stands, and pre-outbreak stands had lower crowning indices than outbreak stands (Table 5).|$|R

5|$|Significant <b>severe</b> <b>weather</b> was ongoing at {{the start}} of April 27 and {{continued}} for the entire day virtually unbroken. For the second day in a row, the SPC issued a high risk of <b>severe</b> <b>weather</b> for the Southern United States, and late that morning the SPC increased the probability for tornadoes to 45 percent along a corridor from Meridian, Mississippi, to Huntsville, Alabama, an extremely rare issuance exceeding the high risk standards. Conditions for tornadoes became increasingly favorable for an extreme tornado outbreak.|$|E
5|$|The Storm Prediction Center(SPC) {{began to}} note the {{possibility}} that a <b>severe</b> <b>weather</b> event could develop on December30 as early as December25, 2010. Nonetheless, the predictability of the event was too low as the event was several days out. As the anticipated event grew closer, confidence in the forecast slowly increased, though uncertainties in the timing and extent of the tornado outbreak still existed. These uncertainties remained through December29 with forecasts calling for only marginal hail and possibly damaging gusts. However, the SPC indicated that supercells and more <b>severe</b> <b>weather</b> could result from atmospheric conditions deviating slightly from the forecast. In contrast, forecasts were more confident in a widespread outbreak of <b>severe</b> <b>weather</b> for New Year's Eve; the SPC issued a slight risk outlook for much of the Lower Mississippi Valley and the Ozarks as a result.|$|E
5|$|The low {{gradually}} weakened {{and became}} less conducive for <b>severe</b> <b>weather</b> development on May 6. Nonetheless, the SPC issued a moderate risk for severe storms over parts of central Kansas and northern Oklahoma as the trough remained in place. The activity {{was far less}} than on the two previous days, however there were still several additional tornadoes across the Plains (all of them weak, mostly EF0). The system finally left the area on May 7 and did not produce any more significant <b>severe</b> <b>weather.</b>|$|E

5|$|The tornado {{outbreak}} of February 28 – March 2, 2007 was a deadly tornado outbreak across the southern United States {{that began in}} Kansas on February28, 2007. The <b>severe</b> <b>weather</b> spread eastward on March1 and left a deadly mark across the southern US, particularly in Alabama and Georgia. Twenty deaths were reported; one in Missouri, nine in Georgia, and 10 in Alabama. Scattered <b>severe</b> <b>weather</b> was also reported in North Carolina on March2, producing the final tornado of the outbreak before the storms moved offshore into the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{jet stream}} moved {{northeast}} across the Great Plains region {{and a strong}} surface low in western Kansas strengthened as it moved to the Nebraska-South Dakota border. Ahead of the low, very warm and moist air spread throughout the South Central United States into Nebraska, eastern sections of South Dakota and the upper Mississippi Valley. The combination of strong winds and warm and moist air created conditions favorable for strong thunderstorms. On June 5, {{a high risk of}} <b>severe</b> <b>weather</b> was issued for six different states in the Midwestern United States, with a moderate risk area surrounding the high risk area. Forecasters had warned of a potentially historic outbreak, as computer forecasting models for June 5resembled those on June 8, 1974, when 39tornadoes struck the southern Great Plains and killed 22people. Wichita State University canceled evening classes because of the weather predictions. <b>Severe</b> <b>weather</b> began developing across eastern Colorado and northwestern Kansas during the morning and into the early afternoon, producing several weak tornadoes in the process. An EF1tornado impacted a campground near Kellogg, Iowa and injured two people. Despite extremely favorable conditions, <b>severe</b> <b>weather</b> for the day was limited and the tornadoes generally caused minimal damage.|$|E
