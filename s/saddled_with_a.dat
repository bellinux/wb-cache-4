5|$|A horse tramway {{was built}} in 1880 by Wigan Corporation and leased to a {{succession}} of private companies to operate services to Pemberton, Aspull and towards Standish. Steam tram operation was introduced quickly, but the network always struggled to pay its way and just {{after the start of}} the 20th century Wigan Corporation gradually bought the operating leases and converted the network to electric tramcar operation. However, the network was <b>saddled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mix of 'standard' gauge and 'narrow' gauge lines, reducing efficiency and increasing costs, and the last of the Wigan Corporation Tramways were closed in 1931 to be replaced by buses which had begun as 'feeder' services to the trams but which had shown themselves to be faster and more flexible. Trolleybuses were operated on a single route from Wigan to Martland Mill from 1925 to 1931.|$|E

Though Holbein retained his position as King's Painter, Cromwell's death left a gap no other patron could fill. It was, ironically, Holbein's portrait of Anne of Cleves which largely led to Cromwell's downfall: furious at being <b>saddled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> wife he found entirely unattractive, the King directed all his anger at Cromwell, whereas {{there is no evidence}} that he blamed Holbein for supposedly flattering Anne's looks.|$|E

After the successors of the Republic (the Batavian Republic and the Kingdom of Holland) were forced to engage in policies of economic warfare against the French Empire, which proved disastrous for Dutch trade and industry; most of the gains of the previous two centuries were rapidly lost. The newly independent Kingdom of the Netherlands was faced in 1815 with an economy that was largely deindustrialized and deurbanized, but still <b>saddled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> crippling public debt, which it was forced to repudiate (the first time that the Dutch state defaulted since the dark pre-independence days of the Revolt).|$|E

500|$|After {{the failure}} of Kidnap and Luck, Khan {{received}} fewer film offers, until Karan Johar approached him for the lead role in I Hate Luv Storys (2010). Directed by Punit Malhotra, the romantic comedy saw him portray Jai Dhingra, a young Casanova who {{does not believe in}} the concept of love and romance. The film garnered mixed reviews from critics; Khan's performance was generally well received. Komal Nahta wrote, [...] "Imran Khan is endearing and does well for {{a good part of the}} film.

I Hate Luv Storys was a domestic and international box-office success, earning [...] Khan expressed his gratitude that Johar gave him the opportunity. His next appearance was in Danish Aslam's coming-of-age romantic comedy Break Ke Baad.

500|$|In 1967, Nunn again ran for governor. After {{defeating}} Marlow Cook in the Republican gubernatorial primary, he eked out {{a victory}} over Democrat Henry Ward. The state offices were split between Democrats and Republicans, and Nunn was <b>saddled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Democratic lieutenant governor, Wendell Ford. Despite a Democratic majority in the General Assembly, Nunn was able to enact most of his priorities, including tax increases that funded improvements to the state park system {{and the construction of}} a statewide network of mental health centers. He oversaw the transition of Northern Kentucky University from a community college to a senior institution and brought the University of Louisville into the state university system. The later years of his administration were marred by race riots in Louisville and a violent protest against the Vietnam War at the University of Kentucky. Following his term as governor, he lost to Walter [...] "Dee" [...] Huddleston in the 1972 senatorial election and John Y. Brown, Jr. in the 1979 gubernatorial contest.

500|$|In 2015, Vidya reteamed with Hashmi in the Mohit Suri-directed romantic drama Hamari Adhuri Kahani. Penned by Mahesh Bhatt, {{the film}} {{tells the story}} of Vasudha, a single mother trapped in an abusive marriage, who has an extra-marital affair. Shubha Shetty-Saha of Mid Day reviewed, [...] "Vidya Balan, a fine actress with {{thousand}} emotions fleeting across her lovely face, has shown us what she's capable of in her earlier movies. But here, <b>saddled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> boring, outdated, weepy character, there was nothing much even she could do". Vidya next took {{on the part of a}} police officer in Te3n (2016), a thriller inspired by the 2013 South Korean film Montage, co-starring Amitabh Bachchan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui. She was attracted to the idea of playing a [...] "no-nonsense police inspector who commands much respect" [...] and was particularly drawn to her character's [...] "silent aggression". NDTV's Saibal Chatterjee criticised the decision to bill Vidya's pivotal role as a special appearance and noted how much her presence benefited the film. Rajeev Masand was critical of the film's predictable denouement, but wrote that Vidya [...] "is reliably solid each time she’s on screen, raising her brow, curling her lip to effectively communicate more than words can". She then portrayed the actress Geeta Bali in multiple songs for Ekk Albela, a Marathi language biopic of the actor-director Bhagwan Dada.|$|E
500|$|In the meantime, the {{negotiations}} {{allowed time for}} loyalists to enter Saigon and rescue the president. Khanh used the remaining communication lines to message senior officers outside Saigon. The Fifth Division of Colonel Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, a future president, brought infantry forces from Biên Hòa, a town north of Saigon. The Seventh Division of Colonel Trần Thiện Khiêm brought in seven infantry battalions and tanks from the Second Armored Battalion from Mỹ Tho, a town in the Mekong Delta south of Saigon. Khiêm was a Catholic with ties to Diệm's older brother, Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục. Khanh also convinced Lê Nguyên Khang, the acting head of the Republic of Vietnam Marine Corps to send the 1st and 2nd Marine Battalions. Rangers were called into Saigon from the western town of Tây Ninh. Assistant Secretary of Defense Nguyễn Đình Thuận phoned Durbrow and discussed the impending standoff between the incoming loyalists and the rebels. Durbrow said [...] "I hope that the Revolutionary Committee and President Diệm can get together and agree to cooperate as a civil war could only benefit communists. If {{one side or the}} other has to make some concessions in order [...] reach an agreement, I believe that would be desirable to ensure unity against the communists."

Chopra, a fan of Disney films, had fun voicing the character saying [...] "The closest I could come to being a Disney princess, I think, was Ishani". The film was a commercial success, grossing approximately US$240 million worldwide. She played an NRI girl in the Apoorva Lakhia's bilingual action drama Zanjeer (Thoofan in Telugu), a remake of the 1973 Hindi film of the same name, which met with poor reactions from critics and was unsuccessful at the box office. Chopra next reprised her role of Priya in Rakesh Roshan's Krrish 3a sequel to the 2006 superhero film Krrishwith Hrithik Roshan, Vivek Oberoi and Kangana Ranaut. The film earned positive reviews though critics opined that Chopra's role in the film was small. Writing for Daily News and Analysis, Sarita A Tanwar commented that [...] "Priyanka is <b>saddled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> role that doesn't do her justice. She deserved a meatier role." [...] The feature became a box office success, earning over [...] worldwide, to become Chopra's biggest commercial success till date and her fourth major hit in the last two years.

500|$|After the Louisiana Purchase, Breckinridge {{focused on}} {{securing}} {{a vote to}} present the Twelfth Amendment to the states for ratification. He {{did not agree with}} all the changes effected by the amendment, the primary purpose of which was to direct presidential electors to vote separately for president and vice president; he supported abolishing the electoral college, electing both officials by popular vote. Democratic-Republicans wanted the amendment adopted before the 1804 election to avoid Jefferson's being <b>saddled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hostile vice president again, and Breckinridge announced his support for the amendment in late October. With several members of his party absent, {{he would not be able}} to secure the two-thirds majority needed to send the amendment to the states for ratification. Recognizing this fact, Federalists pushed for an immediate vote, putting Breckinridge in the position of trying to delay a vote on a measure both he and his constituents supported. Debate began on November 23 after several Democratic-Republicans had returned. South Carolina Federalist Pierce Butler contended that the amendment would allow large states to pick the president; James Jackson, a Democratic-Republican from Georgia, countered by taunting, [...] "Never will there be a Federal President or Vice-President again elected, to the end of time." [...] Federalists moved adjournment at 6:00p.m. on December 2, but Breckinridge, determined to hold a vote that night, blocked the move and took the floor for the first time in days. By 10:00p.m., senators clamored for a vote, and the measure was approved 22–10. State legislatures quickly acted on the amendment, and by September 23, 1804, it was declared in force for the upcoming election.|$|E

[...] At the end of 1779, Clinton and Cornwallis transported a large force south and initiated the second siege of Charleston during the spring of 1780, which resulted in the surrender of the Continental forces under Benjamin Lincoln. [...] Cornwallis and Clinton at first worked closely together during the siege, but their relationship deteriorated. [...] Cracks had formed between the two as early as October 1776, when Cornwallis reported to General Howe critical comments that Clinton made about Howe's conduct at White Plains. [...] Clinton also seemed to believe that one reason for Cornwallis's trips to England was to scheme for an independent command. [...] Cornwallis as second in command held a dormant commission and would replace Clinton as commander in chief. [...] He was aware that Clinton wanted to resign, but {{he did not want to}} be <b>saddled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> difficult command situation should that occur. [...] Cornwallis consequently avoided advising Clinton as much as possible, in order to avoid responsibility for poor outcomes. [...] The deterioration in their relationship set the stage for some of their communication difficulties that resulted in Cornwallis's eventual surrender at Yorktown. [...] In late April, Clinton detached a force under Cornwallis to ensure that the enemy's communications and supplies were interrupted around the city. [...] Because of this, Cornwallis missed most of the siege bombardment and the surrender in May; forces directed by Cornwallis and led by Banastre Tarleton completed the encirclement of Charleston, skirmishing with the Americans at Monck's Corner and Lenud's Ferry. [...] After the American surrender Clinton ordered Cornwallis to secure South Carolina's interior, while Clinton organized control of Charleston. [...] Not long after Tarleton defeated Abraham Buford's Virginia regiments at Waxhaw, Clinton {{returned to}} New York, leaving Cornwallis in command in the south.|$|E

500|$|Tierney in 2006 {{assembled}} {{a group of}} investors to form Philadelphia Media Holdings LLC, a group started with the purpose of buying The Philadelphia Inquirer and Philadelphia Daily News. Chief executive of Philadelphia Media Holdings, Mr. Tierney also became the publisher of the Philadelphia Inquirer shortly after Philadelphia Media Holdings bought the paper. Initially, there were concerns about Tierney's neutrality because of earlier roles he held working in Republican politics and clashes he had with some reporters. But Mr. Tierney calmed those fears by hiring respected journalist and two-time Pulitzer Prize winner William K. Marimow as editor of The Inquirer and by signing a pledge not to interfere with the editorial content of the two newspapers. Under Mr. Marimow, the editorial quality of The Inquirer improved as the paper returned to its roots by doing more investigative stories. Initially, circulation increased in 2007 and advertising sales improved. Meanwhile, the Daily News won the 2010 Pulitzer Prize for investigative journalism for a series of stories on corrupt Philadelphia cops. However, the 2008 financial crisis led to a steep drop in advertising revenue. At the same time, circulation dropped as more readers migrated to the Internet. Newspaper values across the country plummeted by 90 percent or more. Mr. Tierney's group bought the paper {{at the top of the}} market and was <b>saddled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> heavy debt burden. As a result, Philadelphia Media Holdings was forced to file for bankruptcy protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On April 28, 2010, the Philadelphia Inquirer, Daily News and philly.com were sold at a bankruptcy auction to a group of the original lenders, hedge funds and vulture investors led by Angelo Gordon & Company for $139 million.

Several news accounts of his tenure have called him an [...] "improbable savior" [...] and an [...] "unlikely warrior."
