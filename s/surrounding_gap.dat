For convenience we refer to cells encompassing the oocyte, before antrum and gap junction formation, as follicle cells. After the appearance of an antrum and gap junctions we call the cells granulosa cells. Maculae adherentes are found at the interfaces of oocyte-follicle-granuiosa cells throughout foiliculogenesis. Gap junctions are first detected in follicles when the antrum appears. In early antral follicles typical large gap junctions are randomly distributed between granulosa cells. In freeze-fracture replicas, they are characterized by polygonally packed 90 -A particles arranged in rows separated by nonparticulate A-face membrane.

40|$|The present paper {{reports the}} added-value of using SPH in the fluid-structure {{interaction}} {{occurring in the}} run-up and overtopping phenomena for a the rubble mound breakwater, where the seaward layer is made of grooved cubic blocks. The main goal {{is the study of}} the equivalent roughness of the outer layer, defined as the ratio of the maximum water level (run-up) on the armoured structure to the run-up on a smooth similar one. Run-up heights and overtopping rates have also been compared with empirical solutions. The complex geometry of the blocks and the <b>surrounding</b> <b>gaps</b> within breakwaters must be efficiently simulated to obtain {{a detailed description of the}} flow.

40|$|We {{study the}} effects of an annular gap induced by an {{embedded}} proto-planet on the hydrostatic structure of the protoplanetary disk. Previously, we found that such a gap produces a bright ring <b>surrounding</b> the dark <b>gap</b> in scattered light images (Varnière et al. 2005). This effect occurs because stellar radiation that would have been scattered (and absorbed) by material within in the gap is instead reprocessed by the disk wall at {{the outer edge of the}} gap, producing a bright ring <b>surrounding</b> the dark <b>gap</b> in the images. The light absorbed by the outer wall raises its temperature, which in turn increases the disk scale height at that location. As a result, the outer wall of the gap will shadow the outer region of the disk. In this paper, we investigate whether or not this self-shadowing will lead to a collapse of the outer disk as suggested by Dullemond (2002); Dullemond & Dominik (2004) ...|$|R

Generation of {{valuable}} {{information about the}} biphasic geometrical configuration of porcine stratum corneum from Very Small Angle Neutron Scattering (VSANS) data and investigation of {{its effect on the}} corresponding effective diffusivity. Methods, Spectra of porcine stratum corneum are mathematically transformed in order to obtain the: corresponding auto-correlation function (ACF).

40|$|Friction {{and wear}} are {{experienced}} {{both in terms}} of machine operation and finance. They impact, amongst other things, energy consumption and material loss, product manufacture and component maintenance. Liquid lubrication is widely used on machinery interfaces to separate the loaded surfaces, with the ultimate aim of reducing friction and wear from direct metallic contacts. However, in most engineering applications, the lubricant film thickness is not thick enough to fully separate matching surfaces because of too high loads or low speeds. Therefore, the interface contains isolated asperity contacts with the <b>surrounding</b> <b>gaps</b> filled by liquid, which is known as mixed lubrication. The aim of this project is to investigate engineering interfaces using both theoretical and experimental approaches. A statistical mixed lubrication model has been built in this study. The friction force, load sharing proportions, film formation and normal contact stiffness can be simulated for engineering interfaces under varying operating conditions. The model was applied to a greased contact of a landing gear articulating pin joint and an oil lubricated contact of a ball-on-disc. Friction forces, load sharing ratios, contact stiffness, and mean film thickness from asperity contact and lubricant layer have been predicted and compared with experimental measurements. The ultrasonic method was applied to the greased pin joint contact and the oil lubricated ball-on-disc contact. Reflection measurements have been linked to the interface characteristics, including contact pressure, lubricating film thickness and contact stiffness. A start-up process of a ball sliding on disc was studied to extract contributions from asperity interaction and trapped lubricant on the interface. Finally, a shear study on a dry Perspex contact was carried out using the ultrasonic technique. The shear stiffness in the stationary and stick-slip process was studied which presents the shear performance of contacting asperities under normal pressure. Results of these investigations show that the mixed lubrication model and the ultrasonic technique could be used to accurately determine the interfacial characteristics for real engineering contacts. Agreement between analytical model and ultrasonic measurement is found to be good, indicating the applicability of the technique for analysis of contact size, contact pressure and interfacial stiffness.

Samples of pure titanium and of this material coated with hydroxyapatite by plasma spraying were implanted in dogs.

5000|$|Endoexocytosis is a {{cellular}} process. It {{is a unique}} internalization {{process in which the}} two opposing gap junction plaque membranes are internalized into one of two contacting cells, to form pentilaminar-annular gap junction vesicles. In non-gap junctional membrane internalization, endocytosis can occur independent of the conditions in adjacent cells. However in the case of gap junction plaque internalization the membrane of the adjacent cell is internalized into its contacting cell pair, and is thus an “endoexocytic” process. It has been previously suggested that gap junction plaque internalization is mediated by clathrin and its associated proteins. This hypothesis was supported initially, by the presence of the bristle-like coat <b>surrounding</b> annular <b>gap</b> junction vesicles and later by the demonstration of the light microscopic immunocytochemical and transmission electron microscopic quantum dot colocalization of clathrin and Cx43-GFP structures. [...] The reports of a decreased number of annular gap junctions following treatments that disrupt clathrin activity provided additional support for a role of clathrin in gap junction plaque internalization and annular gap junction formation.|$|R
