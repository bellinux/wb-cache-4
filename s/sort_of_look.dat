2500|$|Billie Whitelaw {{worked with}} Beckett for 25 years on such plays as Not I, Eh Joe, Krapp's Last Tape, and Footfalls and Rockaby. She first met Beckett in 1963. In her {{autobiography}} she describes {{their first meeting}} in 1963 was [...] "trust at first sight". Beckett went on to write many of his experimental theatre works for her. She came {{to be regarded as}} his muse, the [...] "supreme interpreter of his work", perhaps most famous for her role as the mouth in Not I. She said of the play Rockaby: [...] "I put the tape in my head. And I <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>look</b> in a particular way, but not at the audience. Sometimes as a director Beckett comes out with absolute gems and I use them a lot in other areas. We were doing Happy Days and I just did not know where in the theatre to look during this particular section. And I asked, and he thought for a bit and then said, 'Inward' [...] ". She said of her role in Footfalls: [...] "I felt like a moving, musical Edvard Munch painting and, in fact, when Beckett was directing Footfalls he was not only using me to play the notes but I almost felt that he did have the paintbrush out and was painting." [...] "Sam knew that I would turn myself inside out to give him what he wanted", she explained. [...] "With all of Sam's work, the scream was there, my task was to try to get it out." [...] She stopped performing his plays in 1989 when he died.|$|E
60|$|Sir Isaac {{tried to}} give him a <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>look</b> one gives to an {{unsatisfactory}} clerk.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Clifford {{drew back}} with a horror-stricken face, darting across at her {{daughter}} the same stealthy <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>look</b> she had given her husband the night after Elma's adventure.|$|E
25|$|Handsome, {{with the}} <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>looks</b> {{that would have}} appealed to J. Arthur Rank, personable and polite, he looks ten years younger than his 49 years.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, poor child! He's {{only too}} suitable. I can't explain to you, Lydia; but {{at home he}} wouldn't have looked at a girl like you. What <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> person is he?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Imogene {{lifted her}} head at last, and softly dried her eyes. Then, as she pushed her {{handkerchief}} back {{into the pocket of}} her robe, [...] "What <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> girl was that other one?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>look</b> she had. A {{look as if}} {{she were}} {{naturally}} above him, and had somehow fascinated herself with him, and were worshipping him in some sort of illusion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll see to him, ma'am," [...] called Chris, as he hung on behind, {{and waved}} his old straw hat, with a steady, {{reliable}} <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>look,</b> {{that made the}} anxious lady feel more comfortable.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bennett sat down. He {{put away}} his handkerchief, which had {{certainly}} earned a rest. Then he fastened a baleful stare upon his newly-discovered son. It {{was not the}} <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>look</b> a proud and happy father-in-law-to-be ought to have directed at a prospective relative. It was not, {{as a matter of}} fact, the <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>look</b> which anyone ought to have directed at anybody except possibly an exceptionally prudish judge at a criminal in the dock, convicted of a more than usually atrocious murder. Billie, not being in the actual line of fire, only caught the tail end of it, but it was enough to create a misgiving.|$|E
6000|$|Campbell: [...] "I {{dare say}} you think so. But you'd better cast your eagle eye over this {{assemblage}} now, {{and see if}} she isn't here; though probably she's gone. What <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> woman is she?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are a man; {{you know}} him; {{you know all}} <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> things--all <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> ways <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> at things, I don't know. If you could go so far--as to be frank." ...|$|R
2500|$|In a 2002 {{interview}} with PBS, Martel said [...] "I was <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> for a story, {{not only with}} a small 's' but <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> with a capital 'S'– something that would direct my life." [...] He spoke of being lonely and needing direction in his life, and found that writing the novel met this need.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nelly, {{will you}} keep a secret for me?' she pursued, {{kneeling}} down by me, and lifting her winsome eyes to my face with that <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>look</b> which turns off bad temper, even when one has all the right {{in the world to}} indulge it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{thought so}} and think so still; his manner was changed to-day; before, {{he had that}} restless, nervous, excitable look that is the {{indication}} of one phase of insanity; to-day there was the gloomy, brooding <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>look</b> that is equally characteristic of another form of madness.|$|E
6000|$|... "My wife enjoys {{excellent}} health, Betts; {{and grateful}} am I to God {{that it is}} so. But I think all our women have a fresh and sea-air <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>look,</b> a cheerful freshness about them, that I ascribe to the salt and the sea-breezes. Then we have mountain air, in addition, on the Peak." ...|$|E
50|$|It {{is written}} {{from the point}} of view of a man who has passed on, and hes <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> down wishing that he had been a {{different}} person, and having a lot of regrets and wishing he hadnt had the negative effect on the people in his life and err... I dont know what I just said...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh yes, it has exactly {{recalled}} {{to me the}} <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> gracious <b>look</b> {{that he used to}} have--half sly, half sweet-and so very pretty!' ...|$|R
60|$|She {{regarded}} {{him with a}} <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> wonder--a <b>look</b> that put a fine edge of dignity and scorn to her words when they came.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no; I'd rather tramp and starve. He's awful hard {{to me and}} Sanch; and he'd be worse, now father's gone. Don't send me back! Let me stay here; {{folks are}} good to me; there's nowhere else to go." [...] And the head Ben had lifted up with a desperate <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>look,</b> went down again on Sancho's breast {{as if there were}} no other refuge left.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do not ask me {{to leave}} you, Mrs. Bold," [...] said he with an impassioned look, impassioned and sanctified as well, with that <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>look</b> which is not {{uncommon}} with gentlemen of Mr. Slope's school and which may perhaps be called the tender-pious. [...] "Do not {{ask me to}} leave you till I have spoken a few words with which my heart is full--which I have come hither purposely to say." ...|$|E
60|$|Then Peter told Unc' Billy {{all about}} Sammy Jay's {{troubles}} and {{all about the}} troubles of Sticky-toes the Tree Toad. It was the first Unc' Billy Possum had heard about it, for Unc' Billy had been away from the Green Forest and the Green Meadows for a visit and had just returned. He listened to all that Peter Rabbit had to say, and a funny, pleased <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>look</b> came into his eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘Wot <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a <b>looking</b> man he is?’ {{repeated}} Rowley. ‘Well, I don’t {{very well}} know wot you would say, Mr. Anne. He ain’t a beauty, any’ow.’ ...|$|R
60|$|Directly I {{managed to}} tear myself away {{that night and}} get home, I {{made up my mind}} that this was jolly well the last time that I went about with Motty. The only time I met him late at night after that was once when I passed the door of a fairly low-down <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> {{restaurant}} and had to step aside to dodge him as he sailed through the air en route for the opposite pavement, with a muscular <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> chappie peering out after him with a kind of gloomy satisfaction.|$|R
6000|$|... "Wot <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> a <b>looking</b> man he is?" [...] {{repeated}} Rowley. [...] "Well, I don't {{very well}} know wot you would say, Mr. Anne. He ain't a beauty, any'ow." ...|$|R
6000|$|But, at last, {{he turned}} to his comrade, with a final <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>look</b> about him,--"Captain Bildad--come, old shipmate, we must go. Back the mainyard there! Boat ahoy! Stand by to come close alongside, now! Careful, careful!--come, Bildad, boy-- say your last. Luck to ye, Starbuck--luck to ye, Mr. Stubb-- luck to ye, Mr. Flask--good-bye and good luck to ye all-- and this day three years I'll have a hot supper smoking for ye in old Nantucket. Hurrah and away!" ...|$|E
60|$|As he said this, with a despairing <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>look,</b> as if {{he could}} not spare even so humble a friend as myself, my heart was quite rent within me, and, {{regardless}} of several prim English ladies, I drew down his tall head and kissed him tenderly, feeling that in this world there were no more meetings for us. Then I ran away and buried myself in an empty railway carriage, hugging the little cologne bottle he had given me.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{here is to}} thee," [...] {{said the}} fashionable gallant whom we have described, [...] "honest Tom; {{and a cup of}} welcome to thee out of Looby-land. Why, thou hast been so long in the country, that thou hast got a bumpkinly clod-compelling <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>look</b> thyself. That greasy doublet fits thee as if it were thy {{reserved}} Sunday's apparel; and the points seem as if they were stay-laces bought for thy true-love Marjory. I marvel thou canst still relish a ragout. Methinks now, to a stomach bound in such a jacket, eggs and bacon were a diet more conforming." ...|$|E
60|$|They made a slow {{circuit of}} the room, passed through an ante-chamber {{and came out}} in a <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> winter-garden <b>looking</b> over the Park. Lady Caroom exclaimed with delight.|$|R
500|$|He {{was wearing}} a pink t-shirt, {{stonewashed}} jeans, he had a mullet haircut, and he was driving a 280Z, and had yellow drums. We were <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> {{each other in the}} eye thinking, 'This ain't gonna happen, this is not the guy.' [...] he'd learned all our songs, as only Jimmy can, off the top of his head, and, within one practice, we were ready to play. It was amazing. We just knew right away. He's that good.|$|R
2500|$|... "It's been {{a passionate}} goal of mine to ski off an 8,000 meter peak. I guess there's a lot <b>of</b> people <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> {{to do this}} and try to ski off Everest. But for me, it's got to be an {{aesthetic}} and quality run. And Shishapangma has the best ski line of any of the 8,000 meter peaks. It's just an absolutely straight shot right down the Southwest Face. That's {{going to be a good}} one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I took {{a suit of}} Freddie's clothes away {{to brush}} just now; and happening"--Mr. Judson paused and gave a little cough--"happening to glance at the {{contents}} of his pockets I come across a letter. I took a <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>look</b> at it before setting it aside, and it was from a fellow named Jones; and it said that this girl, Valentine, was sticking onto young Freddie's letters what he'd written her, and would see him blowed if she parted with them under another thousand. And, as I made it out, Freddie had already given her five hundred.|$|E
60|$|Slowly, as I {{compared}} these mental {{pictures of}} my first childhood one with the other, a strange fact seemed to loom forth, incomprehensible, incredible. When first it struck me, all unnerved as I was, my reason staggered before it. But it was true, none the less: quite true, I felt certain. Had I had two papas, then?--for the pictures differed so. Was one, clean-shaven, trim, and in a linen coat, {{the same as the}} other, older, graver, and sterner, with much hair on his face, and a rough <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>look,</b> whom I saw more persistently in my later childish memories? I could hardly believe it. One man couldn't alter so greatly in a few short years. Yet I thought of them both alike quite unquestioningly as papa: I thought of them too, I fancied, in a dim sort of way, as one and the same person.|$|E
60|$|Archie {{rose from}} his seat and spun round. This mean attack from the rear stung his {{fighting}} spirit. As he rose, a young man sitting immediately {{in front of him}} rose too and stared likewise. He was a square-built resolute-looking young man, who reminded Archie vaguely of somebody he had seen before. But Archie was too busy trying to locate the man at the back to pay much attention to him. He detected him at last, owing {{to the fact that the}} eyes of everybody in that part of the room were fixed upon him. He was a small man of middle age, with tortoise-shell-rimmed spectacles. He might have been a professor or something of the kind. Whatever he was, he was obviously a man to be reckoned with. He had a rich <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>look,</b> and his demeanour was the demeanour of a man who is prepared to fight it out on these lines if it takes all the summer.|$|E
50|$|He {{was wearing}} a pink t-shirt, {{stonewashed}} jeans, he had a mullet haircut, and he was driving a 280Z, and had yellow drums. We were <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> <b>looking</b> {{each other in the}} eye thinking, 'This ain't gonna happen, this is not the guy.' But he'd learned all our songs, as only Jimmy can, off the top of his head, and, within one practice, we were ready to play. It was amazing. We just knew right away. He's that good.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{where do}} you come in?" [...] says the old man, with a <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> hard <b>look.</b> He had a fine {{business}} head, the old man, at least in those days.|$|R
6000|$|Liquor had {{rendered}} Jumper's faculties somewhat obtuse, in general, {{though he}} was now perfectly sober. He gave a <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> dull <b>look</b> <b>of</b> recognition at the speaker, and muttered his answer in a low, sluggish tone: ...|$|R
