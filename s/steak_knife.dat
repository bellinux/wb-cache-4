500|$|One of the hawksbill's {{more easily}} {{distinguished}} characteristics is {{the pattern of}} thick scutes that make up its carapace. While its carapace has five central scutes and four pairs of lateral scutes like several members of its family, E. imbricatas posterior scutes overlap {{in such a way}} as to give the rear margin of its carapace a [...] look, similar to the edge of a saw or a <b>steak</b> <b>knife.</b> The turtle's carapace has been known to reach almost [...] in length. The hawksbill appears to frequently employ its sturdy shell to insert its body into tight spaces in reefs.|$|E
500|$|Steak {{has become}} a popular dish in many places around the world, cooked in {{domestic}} as well as professional kitchens, and is often a primary ingredient in a menu. It is used in small amounts in an hors d'oeuvre, in an entrée dish or more usually, in a larger amount as the main course. A <b>steak</b> <b>knife</b> is a specialized piece of cutlery to make cutting the steak easier. It is sharper than other knives and has a serrated edge. Steak has also been an important breakfast dish, especially for people undertaking hard outdoor work, such as farmers. [...] Diners ordering steak at a restaurant typically advise the chef or waiter of their preferences regarding the degree of cooking, using the terms [...] "rare", [...] "medium-rare", [...] "medium", [...] "medium-well", or [...] "well-done". [...] Print appearances of this use of [...] "rare" [...] are found as early as c. 1615.|$|E
500|$|Emanuel {{is known}} for his [...] "take-no-prisoners style" [...] that has earned him the {{nickname}} [...] "Rahmbo." [...] Emanuel sent a dead fish in a box to a pollster who was late delivering polling results. On the night after the 1992 election, angry at Democrats and Republicans who [...] "betrayed" [...] them in the 1992 election, Emanuel stood up at a celebratory dinner with colleagues from the campaign and began plunging a <b>steak</b> <b>knife</b> into the table and began rattling off names while shouting [...] "Dead! Dead! Dead!". Before Tony Blair gave a pro-Clinton speech during the impeachment crisis, Emanuel reportedly screamed at Blair [...] "Don't fuck this up!" [...] while Clinton was present. Blair and Clinton both burst into laughter. However, by 2007 friends of Emanuel were saying that he has [...] "mellowed out". Stories of his personal style have entered the popular culture, inspiring articles and websites that chronicle these and other quotes and incidents. The character Josh Lyman in The West Wing was said to be based on Emanuel, though executive producer Lawrence O'Donnell denied this.|$|E
50|$|Specialized <b>steak</b> <b>knives</b> {{emerged in}} America {{following}} World War II. Prior to World War I, all table knives were sharp, but required frequent upkeep—sharpening and polishing. With {{the decline in}} domestic workers (household servants), this upkeep became less feasible. Stainless steel became widespread following World War I, which did not require polishing, but did require sharpening due to manufacturing limits. Following World War II, serrated stainless steel <b>steak</b> <b>knives</b> were introduced which required neither polishing nor frequent sharpening, and proved an instant hit. In the 1950s heat treatment of stainless steel was introduced, allowing knives to remain sufficiently sharp without needing serrations, but by this point serrated <b>steak</b> <b>knives</b> had become well-established and continued to be used.|$|R

[...] In May 1987, Laurie accused Russell of placing an incendiary device in her home. No charges were filed against Russell for either alleged event. Laurie's parents believed her claims and supported and defended her throughout. By this time, Laurie Dann was being treated by another psychiatrist for obsessive-compulsive disorder and a [...] "chemical imbalance"; the psychiatrist told police {{that he did not}} think Laurie was suicidal or homicidal.|$|E

50|$|Serrations are not {{required}} to cut tomatoes - a sharp straight blade works - but the serrations allow the knife to cut tomatoes and other foods even when dull. The reason for this being most of the cutting takes place in the serrations themselves. Some knives have serrations on both sides allowing easy slicing for both left-handed and right-handed users. Bread <b>knives</b> and <b>steak</b> <b>knives</b> are similarly serrated.|$|R

[...] Doyle explained, [...] "Then we hunted around for knives. We picked out this bizarre-looking <b>steak</b> <b>knife,</b> we thought that this looked really cool, {{we thought it would}} look even cooler if we turned it over and used it upside down. We had to remove the back edge and put another edge on it, because we were actually using the knife upside down." [...] Later Doyle had three duplicates of the glove made, two of which were used as stunt gloves in long shots.|$|E
2500|$|In the Evanston police station, Coleman was strip-searched and a <b>steak</b> <b>knife</b> {{was found}} between two pairs of sweat socks he was wearing. When taken into custody, they had a {{shopping}} bag full of varied T-shirts and caps. Officers learned that the pair stopped every three to four blocks as they walked and changed shirts and caps. A week after they were arrested, more than 50 law enforcement officials from Illinois, Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio met to plan their strategy for prosecuting Coleman and Brown, as the two had committed crimes within each state. Desiring {{the death penalty for}} Coleman and Brown, Michigan was quickly ruled out because it did not employ capital punishment. Eventually it was decided to give Ohio the first attempt at sentencing, with U.S. Attorney Dan K. Webb stating, [...] "We are convinced that prosecution (in Ohio) can most quickly and most likely result in the swiftest imposition of the death penalty against Alton Coleman and Debra Brown".|$|E

50|$|Between 6:20 and 6:45 in {{the morning}} of September 28, 1901, the villagers made their move.

5000|$|Serrated blade knives have a wavy, {{scalloped}} or saw-like blade. Serrations {{help when}} cutting {{things that are}} hard {{on the outside and}} soft on the inside (such as bread or tomatoes); the saw-like action breaks the surface more easily than anything except the very sharpest smooth blade. They are also particularly good on fibrous foods such as celery or cabbage. Serrated knives cut much better than plain-edge blade knives when dull, so they do not require frequent sharpening (some serrated blades are claimed never to need sharpening), and are sometimes used to make <b>steak</b> <b>knives</b> which do not need frequent sharpening. However, they are not readily sharpened properly by a user, requiring specialized equipment, and may never be resharpened during their useful life. Serrations are often used to improve the cutting ability of a less-expensive blade not capable of taking and keeping a sharp edge, usually having a thin, polished blade designed to minimise friction. A serrated knife is more practical for a user who is not prepared to sharpen it frequently; a well-maintained and sharpened smooth edge is keener.|$|R
