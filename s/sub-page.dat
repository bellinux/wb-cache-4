40|$|Although NAND flash-based {{solid-state}} drives (SSDs) excel magnetic disks {{in several}} aspects, {{the costs of}} write operations have been limiting their performance. The overheads of write operations are exacerbated by the fixed write unit (page) of flash memory, which is {{much larger than the}} sector size in magnetic disks. A write request from a file system, with a data size smaller than a page, becomes a full page write in SSDs. With the page size hidden internally in SSDs, file systems and applications may not be optimized to a fixed page size. Furthermore, to increase the density and bandwidth of flash memory, page sizes in SSDs have been increasing. In this paper, we propose a sector-level data management mechanism for SSDs, called sector log. Sector log manages a small part of NAND flash memory in SSDs with sectorlevel mapping, and stores <b>sub-page</b> writes more efficiently than conventional SSDs. While current small DRAM buffers cannot absorb the working set of <b>sub-page</b> writes for certain applications, sector log uses ample persistent storage in flash memory. With the sector mapping mechanism, sector log provides a sector-accessible block device abstraction upon page-managed flash memory...|$|E
30|$|The {{problem of}} live gang {{migration}} (a group of co-located VM’s are migrated simultaneously) is addressed by Deshpande et al. [84]. Authors present the design, implementation, {{and evaluation of}} a de-duplication approach (at the page level and <b>sub-page</b> level) for concurrent VM’s migration. For detail, proof-of-concept prototype de-duplication strategies and a differential compression technique are implemented to exploit content similarity across VM’s. The identical memory pages of VM’s are transferred only once during the migration process. They implemented it by modifying an existing single-VM pre-copy migration in the QEMU/KVM environment. Offline implementation of de-duplication based gang migration is processed using Linux 2.6. 32 OS and QEMU/KVM- 0.12. 3 hypervisor at both source and destination machines. Their approach achieves a considerable improvement in both network traffic and total migration time.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. For more {{scalable}} mobile services, it {{is important}} to reduce the signaling cost for location management. In this paper, we propose a cost effective IP paging scheme utilizing explicit multicast (xcast). Xcast is a new kind of multicast scheme for small sized groups which uses unicast with low maintenance overhead. In terms of the paging algorithm, we use a selective paging scheme to minimize the paging cost, by dividing a paging area into several <b>sub-paging</b> areas. For the performance analysis, we develop an analytical model based on the random walk model in the mesh and hexagonal cell configurations. Using this model, we compared the paging cost between IP paging scheme using xcast and that using unicast or multicast. The results indicate that the proposed paging scheme reduces the paging cost by 44 - 84 % compared with traditional paging schemes using multicast. ...|$|R
