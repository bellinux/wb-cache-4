5|$|News of Chatwin's AIDS {{diagnosis}} first {{surfaced in}} September 1988. However, {{at the time}} of his death, obituaries referred to Chatwin's statements about a rare fungal infection. Following his death, members of the gay community criticised Chatwin for lacking the courage to reveal the true nature of his illness, which <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> would have raised public awareness of AIDS, as he was one of the first high-profile individuals in Great Britain known to have contracted HIV.|$|E
5|$|Salt {{has long}} held an {{important}} place in religion and culture. At {{the time of}} Brahmanic sacrifices, in Hittite rituals and during festivals held by Semites and Greeks {{at the time of}} the new moon, salt was thrown into a fire where it produced crackling noises. The ancient Egyptians, Greeks and Romans invoked their gods with offerings of salt and water and <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> this to be the origin of Holy Water in the Christian faith. In Aztec mythology, Huixtocihuatl was a fertility goddess who presided over salt and salt water.|$|E

50|$|In common {{language}} terms like Ciociaria and ciociari {{are used to}} denote both any movies set in southern Latium and many actors {{who was born in}} province of Frosinone or in province of Latina. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>thinks</b> the term ciociaro is an insult so they refuse to be called like that.|$|R

This is clear and that is why in the Church there are marriage groups, there are experts in this matter, there are pastors, one can search; and I know so many ways that are licit and that have helped this.|$|E
25|$|During the 16th and 17th centuries, Europeans, still {{fascinated by}} the New World, {{believed}} that a hidden city of immense wealth existed. Numerous expeditions were mounted to search for this treasure, all which ended in failure. The illustration of El Dorado's location on maps only made matters worse, as it made <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> that the city of El Dorado's existence had been confirmed. The mythical city of El Dorado on Lake Parime was marked on numerous maps until its existence was disproved by Alexander von Humboldt during his Latin America expedition (1799–1804).|$|E
25|$|Type 2: Antigenically A2B5+, GFAP+, FGFR3−, Ran 2−. These {{cells can}} develop in vitro from the either tripotential GRP (probably via O2A stage) or from bipotential O2A cells (which <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> may in turn have been {{derived from the}} GRP) or in vivo when these {{progenitor}} cells are transplanted into lesion sites (but probably not in normal development, {{at least not in}} the rat optic nerve). Type-2 astrocytes are the major astrocytic component in postnatal optic nerve cultures that are generated by O2A cells grown in the presence of fetal calf serum but are not thought to exist in vivo.|$|E

5|$|The film {{discusses}} why <b>some</b> <b>people</b> enjoy underground horror films involving fetishes. Although {{the film}} is classified as a documentary, there is a fictional subplot which helps advance the film's theme by showing what <b>some</b> <b>people</b> really <b>think</b> about the genre.|$|R
25|$|Sagan wrote {{frequently}} {{about religion}} {{and the relationship between}} religion and science, expressing his skepticism about the conventional conceptualization of God as a sapient being. For example: <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> God is an outsized, light-skinned male with a long white beard, sitting on a throne somewhere up there in the sky, busily tallying the fall of every sparrow. Others—for example Baruch Spinoza and Albert Einstein—considered God to be essentially the sum total of the physical laws which describe the universe. I do not know of any compelling evidence for anthropomorphic patriarchs controlling human destiny from some hidden celestial vantage point, but it would be madness to deny the existence of physical laws.|$|E
500|$|When The Smile Sessions box set was {{released}} in 2011, co-producer Mark Linett acknowledged that [...] "there's things that <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> – should Smiley Smile sessions be there – [...] 'Can't Wait Too Long', we get into a very fuzzy area." [...] In 2017, additional session highlights from the album were released on the rarities compilation 1967 – Sunshine Tomorrow.|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} Guitar Solos spawned two {{follow-up}} albums, Guitar Solos 2 (1976) and Guitar Solos 3 (1979), which featured Frith and other improvising guitarists, including Derek Bailey and Hans Reichel. Frith coordinated and produced these albums, and employed {{many of the}} same [...] "unorthodox techniques" [...] he had used on Guitar Solos. When a remastered edition of the original Guitar Solos was released 28 years later on Frith's own Fred Records label, it attracted further praise from critics. Westergaard wrote that [...] "Guitar Solos lasting legacy is that it radically redefined the way <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> about the guitar." ...|$|E

50|$|In <b>some</b> sources, <b>people</b> <b>think</b> Huang and Minlon are two {{different}} people. It's in fact a mistake, Huang is his family name and Minlon is his first name. Huang Minglon is the Wade-Giles spelling, and Huang Minglong is its Pinyin romanization of the Chinese characters in his name.|$|R
500|$|Even {{with close}} friends, I don't believe in letting your hair down, confiding {{this and that}} and the other thing—saying, 'Gee, I couldn't sleep'... I believe you should keep your {{troubles}} to yourself. That's just the way I am. Some people are different. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> it's good therapy to sit with a close friend and, you know, just spill your guts... reveal their inner psyche—whether they were breast-fed or bottle-fed. Not me. No way. When told that most Americans, even {{at the end of his}} career, did not feel they knew him, Nixon replied, [...] "Yeah, it's true. And it's not necessary for them to know." ...|$|E
500|$|Bass {{found himself}} in the midst of further {{controversy}} later that year when he, along with then-boyfriend Reichen Lehmkuhl, was awarded the 2006 Human Rights Campaign Visibility Award on October 7, 2006. The Washington Blade printed a guest editorial from a long-time HRC supporter who claimed that neither recipient had done enough to deserve the award and that The Human Rights Campaign was simply capitalizing on Bass's fame to sell tickets. The Human Rights Campaign stood by Bass and defended his award, responding to critics by saying, [...] "Bass is the biggest music star since Melissa Etheridge to come out, and maybe <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> HRC should just ignore these moments of cultural significance, but his declaration did initiate a positive, national conversation that continues today." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{their native}} Oregon, the Daddies {{have been called}} [...] "a Northwest institution", having been {{inducted}} into the Oregon Music Hall of Fame in 2009. The Register-Guard has credited the band with shaping Eugene's alternative musical culture in the 1990s, while Eugene Weekly added likewise, [...] "when <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> of the Northwest music scene, they think of grunge. If you’re a Eugenean, however, you might think of swing, thanks to [...] Cherry Poppin' Daddies". Seattle's The Rocket commented on the band's influence in 1997, stating [...] "he Daddies were busting out the swing before the Squirrel Nut Zippers, stirring cocktails before Combustible Edison and skating the ska before Sublime...the band shakes out an incredible variety of sounds with peerless verve and polish." ...|$|E

50|$|In 1993 the U.S. Army {{bought a}} small number of GP16s from CSX, which led <b>some</b> <b>people</b> to <b>think</b> the Army built it.

2500|$|The Iranian {{government}} {{responded that}} [...] "the Western media empire {{is trying to}} portray Iran as an anti-Semitic country". In addition, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said that [...] "Jews are respected by everyone, by all human beings... <b>some</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> if they accuse me of being anti-Jew they can solve the problem.

50|$|Justice Holmes dissented, {{arguing that}} the law of unfair {{competition}} requires a misrepresentation.

2500|$|Currently, most specialists think migraines {{are due to}} {{a primary}} problem with the nerves in the brain. Auras {{are thought to be}} caused by a wave of {{increased}} activity of neurons in the cerebral cortex (a part of the brain) known as cortical spreading depression followed by a period of depressed activity. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> <b>think</b> headaches are caused by the activation of sensory nerves which release peptides, such as serotonin, causing inflammation in arteries, dura and [...] meninges and also cause some vasodilation. Triptans, medications which treat migraines, block serotonin receptors and constrict blood vessels.|$|E
50|$|Systems {{thinking}} is {{a style of}} thinking/reasoning and problem solving. It starts from the recognition of system properties in a given problem. It can be a leadership competency. <b>Some</b> <b>people</b> can <b>think</b> globally while acting locally. Such people consider the potential consequences of their decisions on other parts of larger systems. This is also a basis of systemic coaching in psychology.|$|R
5000|$|The meaning {{behind the}} image was also lost on <b>some</b> <b>people,</b> which Parker went into detail, saying, [...] "I didn't know whether {{people were going to}} get what the picture was getting at.
