For the microscopic identification of the tongue, the optical microscopy and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques were used.

Finally, we investigated whether sound symbolic associations for first names would be observed for other abstract properties; in particular, personality traits (Experiment 2). We found that adjectives previously judged to be either descriptive of a figuratively 'round' or a 'sharp' personality were associated with names containing either round- or sharp-sounding phonemes, respectively.

When subjected to heat fluxes in the order of 7 MW/m 2, the surface temperature of the UHTC wedge increased up to 2450 °C near the leading edge.

40|$|International audienceSince {{the arrival}} of Rosetta at comet 67 P, {{numerous}} pictures have been delivered by the cameras onboard both the main spacecraft and the Philae lander. They revealed, at the nucleus' surface and inside {{the walls of the}} deep pits, few-meters scale repeating structures, thus providing hints about the internal structure of the nucleus, and suggesting that primordial 'cometesimals' may be objects around 3 m in size. The CONSERT (Comet Nucleus Sounding Experiment by Radiowave Transmission) experiment is a radar that has been designed to specifically sound the interior of the nucleus and to provide information on the nucleus internal structure. The work presented here is based on the CONSERT data collected during the First Science Sequence (FSS) and marginally during Philae’s Separation Descent and Landing (SDL) for comparison. During FFS, the smaller lobe of the nucleus in the vicinity of Abydos has been actually sounded by CONSERT’s electromagnetic waves at 90 MHz with a spatial resolution around 10 m. The propagation delays measured during FSS are consistent with a very low bulk permittivity value for the investigated cometary material, which confirms the high porosity of the nucleus. The <b>sharp</b> <b>shape</b> of the received pulses indicates that the electromagnetic waves suffered weak scattering when propagating through the nucleus. This suggests that the sounded part nucleus is thus fairly homogeneous on a spatial scale of tens of meters. We will present further results on the variation of the CONSERT’s pulse shape transmitted through the small lobe of the nucleus. For a more accurate analysis and interpretation of the data, we split the FSS data into two distinct sets corresponding to soundings performed West and East of Philae in order to investigate potential differences. Tentative interpretation in terms of nucleus internal structure based on propagation simulations performed in non-homogeneous nucleus numerical models will be presented...|$|E

40|$|<b>Sharp</b> <b>shapes</b> in the {{inflaton}} potentials {{often lead}} to short departures from slow roll which, in turn, result in deviations from scale invariance in the scalar power spectrum. Typically, in such situations, the scalar power spectrum exhibits a burst of features associated with modes that leave the Hubble radius either immediately before or during the epoch of fast roll. Moreover, one also finds that the power spectrum turns scale invariant at smaller scales corresponding to modes that leave the Hubble radius at later stages, when slow roll has been restored. In other words, the imprints of brief departures from slow roll, arising out of <b>sharp</b> <b>shapes</b> in the inflaton potential, are usually of a finite width in the scalar power spectrum. Intuitively, one may imagine that the scalar bi-spectrum too may exhibit a similar behavior, i. e. a restoration of scale invariance at small scales, when slow roll has been reestablished. However, {{in the case of}} the Starobinsky model (viz. the model described by a linear inflaton potential with a sudden change in its slope) involving the canonical scalar field, it has been found that, a rather sharp, though short, departure from slow roll can leave a lasting and significant imprint on the bi-spectrum. The bi-spectrum in this case is found to grow linearly with the wavenumber at small scales, a behavior which is clearly unphysical. In this work, we study the effects of smoothening the discontinuity in the Starobinsky model on the scalar bi-spectrum. Focusing on the equilateral limit, we analytically show that, for smoother potentials, the bi-spectrum indeed turns scale invariant at suitably large wavenumbers. We also confirm the analytical results numerically using our newly developed code BINGO. We conclude with a few comments on certain related points.

40|$|AbstractIn {{an attempt}} to improve {{understanding}} between pinning behaviour and underlying microstructures, {{results of the investigation}} on multifilamentary Cu/Nb- 47 w%Ti alloy are presented. Wire was drawn to final size without intermediate stage thermomechanical treatments. Cold worked structure was subjected to isothermal annealing at 648 K for various annealing times between 2 minutes to 100 hours. Microstructural and compositional features were studied by transmission electron microscopy, TEM, and analytical TEM equipped with EDS analyzer. The pinning behavior was monitored by the maximum volume pinning force determined using transport current measurements at 4. 2 K up to 9 T. According to the present results, the average grain boundary spacing remained rather constant at 45 nm throughout all annealing times while the average grain boundary width increased from the initial dimension of 1 nm to 1. 8 nm after 100 hours as a result of precipitation processes at grain boundaries. Further, distributions of the grain boundary widths changed from a <b>sharp</b> <b>shape</b> to a wider spectrum of widths. The precipitation process created titanium concentration gradients {{in the vicinity of the}} grain boundaries. As the annealing time increased, the sharp gradients became shallower and Ti concentrations as low as 35 w% Ti were observed after 40 hours. High field pinning at 9 T was associated with structures having a mean grain boundary width of 1. 2 nm and titanium concentration gradients on a scale of 2. 5 to 5 nm from the grain boundaries. Mid magnetic field pinning was favored by microstructures having titanium gradients on a scale of 5 - 10 nm and the mean width of 1. 5 nm while improved low field pinning at 3 T was associated with microstructures having the mean width of 1. 8 nm, shallow gradients and titanium concentrations as low as 35 w% inside of the grains...|$|E

Since then the aerodynamic control system that using moveable flaps {{to increase the}} aerodynamic stability of bridge {{has been an important}} aspect in bridge aerodynamic designs. In last two decades, the record of longest bridge in the world is refreshed frequently, which means the size of current bridges is much bigger than previous bridge. Basically, aerodynamic control system is an indispensable part of a super long bridge, and the active control system seems the only solution to improve the aerodynamic stability when the main span exceeds 3000 m. The purpose of this thesis is to study the effect of active aerodynamic control system with two <b>sharp</b> <b>shape</b> control devices installed on the edges of deck by FEM simulation. Here, the Tatara Bridge is analyzed via FEM software ABAQUS and SOLIDWORKS. This study consists of FEM modal analysis of the bridge, wind tunnel test simulation and wind effect test modeling for the entire bridge under the wind from different directions. In the bridge modal analysis, first 400 vibration mode shapes and their corresponding frequencies are calculated through Lanczos method solver in ABAQUS and the first order mode shape is found to be lateral bending of the deck. Therefore, the target is to optimize the deck shape to reduce the lateral aerodynamic force. To achieve this goal, 9 deck shapes are designed and tested under wind load from 15 different directions in the wind tunnel test simulation through SOLIDWORKS. The result of this test shows the optimized deck shapes can significantly reduce the lateral aerodynamic force. Then the wind effect tests of the entire bridge before and after optimization are performed in ABAQUS. As shown in the results, the displacement of midspan is decreased, especially in lateral direction. The results {{of this study indicate that}} this actively transformable sharp control surface can significantly reduce the response of the bridge under lateral aerodynamic force...|$|E

Various plasmonic dimers have been investigated, including nanosphere dimers [31], nanodisk dimers [32], and nanorod dimers [33]. In particular, nanorod dimers provide a strongly coupled mode to achieve a large field enhancement in the gap because the rod-shaped structure possesses a <b>sharper</b> <b>shape</b> that allows more charges to be accumulated at the rod tip, i.e., the lightning-rod effect [34].
