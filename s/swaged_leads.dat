50|$|High pressures, such {{as those}} {{commonly}} encountered in maximum loadings of magnum revolver cartridges or rifle cartridges, often result in significant problems when coupled with cast or <b>swaged</b> <b>lead</b> bullets. It was long thought that the high temperatures melted {{the base of the}} bullet, but this is no longer thought to be the case. Instead, the high pressures allow propellant gas to escape past the bullet, causing gas cutting, which increases lead deposits in the barrel and unbalances the bullet. A gas check provides a thin layer of harder but still malleable metal on the base of the bullet that obturates to provide a seal and prevents the propellant gas leakage that causes gas cutting, and help the bullet grip the rifling.|$|R
40|$|Thermocouple {{continuously}} measures {{a flowing}} gas up to 4500 degrees F in a hazardous environment. The thermocouple combines rhenium and tungsten in the probe, housing, and <b>swaged</b> extension <b>lead.</b> The wires extend continuously {{from the cold}} junction to the probe tip to eliminate errors from secondary thermocouple effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{extrusion}} {{and cold}} <b>swaging</b> processes <b>lead</b> to the elongation of grains. This micrograph shows a longitudinal section with the working direction lying horizontal. Since the material {{has only been}} annealed for 1 h at 350 degrees C, recrystallisation has only just started. Nucleation occurs at the reinforcement particles {{but there is no}} clear preference for nucleation at highly angular particles or particles with high aspect ratios. It was also noted that recrystallisation occurs preferentially at the surface of cold swaged specimens, probably due to strain localisation. ...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{innovative}} feature, more {{usually associated}} with 20th-century guns, was what Armstrong called its [...] "grip", which was essentially a squeeze bore; the 6 inches of the bore at the muzzle end was of slightly smaller diameter, which centered the shell before it left the barrel {{and at the same}} time slightly <b>swaged</b> down its <b>lead</b> coating, reducing its diameter and slightly improving its ballistic qualities.|$|R
40|$|An {{advanced}} {{thin film}} sensor system instrumented on silicon carbide (SiC) fiber reinforced SiC matrix ceramic matrix composites (SiC/SiC CMCs), was evaluated in a Mach 0. 3 burner rig {{in order to}} determine its durability to monitor material/component surface temperature in harsh environments. The sensor system included thermocouples in a thin film form (5 microns thick), fine lead wires (75 microns diameter), and the bonds between these wires and the thin films. Other critical components of the overall system were the heavy, <b>swaged</b> <b>lead</b> wire cable (500 microns diameter) that contained the fine lead wires and was connected to the temperature readout, and ceramic attachments which were bonded onto the CMCs for the purpose of securing the lead wire cables, The newly developed ceramic attachment features a combination of hoops made of monolithic SiC or SiC/SiC CMC (which are joined to the test article) and high temperature ceramic cement. Two instrumented CMC panels were tested in a burner rig for a total of 40 cycles to 1150 C (2100 F). A cycle consisted of rapid heating to 1150 C (2100 F), a 5 minute hold at 1150 C (2100 F), and then cooling down to room temperature in 2 minutes. The thin film sensor systems provided repeatable temperature measurements for a maximum of 25 thermal cycles. Two of the monolithic SiC hoops debonded during the sensor fabrication process and two of the SiC/SiC CMC hoops failed during testing. The hoops filled with ceramic cement, however, showed no sign of detachment after 40 thermal cycle test. The primary failure mechanism of this sensor system was the loss of the fine lead wire-to-thin film connection, which either due to detachment of the fine lead wires from the thin film thermocouples or breakage of the fine wire...|$|R
2500|$|In piano technology, swaging {{happens in}} several areas: key leads, underlever leads, and bass strings. Key leads which, in the piano's {{earliest}} history, were actually made using lead, are soft, round chunks that are inserted into holes drilled {{into the side}} of piano keys as a means of balancing actions. Key leads vary in size, generally small, medium, and large. Basically, key leads help to make a keyboard's touch light enough to play. Over time, due to fluctuations in humidity and as the wood ages in piano key-sticks and underlevers, space develops around leads causing them to rattle, tick, or knock. Loose leads in underlevers tend to be the most annoying to pianists because it's difficult to pinpoint where the noise (often a [...] "tick" [...] sound) is coming from. The remedy for the noise is swaging—squashing the leads with a short steel rod. <b>Swaging</b> the <b>lead</b> fills the void and eliminates the noise.|$|R
2500|$|Other {{advantages}} of casting or <b>swaging</b> bullets from <b>lead</b> wire (which is pricier but avoids many quality-control issues of casting) {{is the ability}} to precisely control many attributes of the resulting bullet. [...] Custom bullet molds are available from a number of sources, allowing the handloader to pick the exact weight, shape, and diameter of the bullet to fit the cartridge, firearm, and intended use. [...] A good example of where this is useful is for shooters of older military surplus firearms, which often exhibit widely varying bore and groove diameters; by making bullets specifically intended for the firearm in question, accuracy of the resulting cartridges can be significantly increased.|$|R
40|$|The work of {{deformation}} {{or energy}} consumption during shearing of two plain carbon steels with 0. 1 wt% and 0. 45 wt% carbon was determined {{as a function}} of strain rate. The steel with 0. 1 wt% carbon was predeformed by <b>swaging.</b> A predeformation <b>leads</b> to minor energy consumption. The grain size of the steel with 0. 45 wt% carbon was varied by different annealing treatments. The work of deformation increase with rising grain size. This effect seems to be initiated by Lüders strain. In the steel Ck 10 only homogeneous shearing or deformation shear zones could be observed, while in the steel Ck 45 transformation shear zones occured additionally...|$|R

5000|$|The gun {{was also}} a breech-loader. Although {{attempts}} at breech-loading mechanisms had been made since medieval times, the essential engineering {{problem was that the}} mechanism couldn't withstand the explosive charge. It was only with the advances in metallurgy and precision engineering capabilities during the Industrial Revolution that Armstrong was able to construct a viable solution. Another innovative feature was what Armstrong called its [...] "grip", which was essentially a squeeze bore; the 6 inches of the bore at the muzzle end was of slightly smaller diameter, which centered the shell before it left the barrel {{and at the same time}} slightly <b>swaged</b> down its <b>lead</b> coating, reducing its diameter and slightly improving its ballistic qualities.|$|R
25|$|In {{ammunition}} manufacture, swaged bullets are bullets {{manufactured by}} compressing metal {{at room temperature}} into a die to form it {{into the shape of}} a bullet. The other common manufacturing method is casting, which uses molten metals poured into a mold. Since metals expand when heated and contract when cooled, cast bullets must be cast with a mold slightly larger than the desired finish size, so that as the molten metal cools, it will harden at just the right point to shrink to the desired size. In contrast, swaged bullets, since they are formed at the temperature at which they will be used, can be formed in molds of the exact desired size. This means that swaged bullets are generally more precise than cast bullets. The <b>swaging</b> process also <b>leads</b> to fewer imperfections, since voids commonly found in casting would be pressed out in the swaging process. The swaging process in reference to cold flow of metals into bullets is the process not of squeezing the metals into smaller forms but rather pressing smaller thinner items to form into shorter and slightly wider shapes.|$|R
