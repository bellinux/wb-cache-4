40|$|Mechanisms that {{suppress}} recombination {{are known}} to help maintain <b>species</b> <b>barriers</b> by preventing the breakup of coadapted gene combinations. The sympatric butterfly species Heliconius melpomene and Heliconius cydno are separated by many strong <b>barriers,</b> but the <b>species</b> still hybridize infrequently in the wild, and around 40 % of the genome is influenced by introgression. We tested the hypothesis that genetic <b>barriers</b> between the <b>species</b> are maintained by inversions or other mechanisms that reduce between-species recombination rate. We constructed fine-scale recombination maps for Panamanian populations of both species and their hybrids to directly measure recombination rate within and between species, and generated long sequence reads to detect inversions. We find no evidence for a systematic reduction in recombination rates in F 1 hybrids, and also no evidence for inversions longer than 50 kb that might be involved in generating or maintaining <b>species</b> <b>barriers.</b> This suggests that mechanisms leading to global or local reduction in recombination do not {{play a significant role}} in the maintenance of <b>species</b> <b>barriers</b> between H. melpomene and H. cydno...|$|R

25|$|Swine {{influenza}} {{was first}} proposed to be a disease related to human flu during the 1918 flu pandemic, when pigs became ill {{at the same}} time as humans. The first identification of an influenza virus as a cause of disease in pigs occurred about ten years later, in 1930. For the following 60 years, swine influenza strains were almost exclusively H1N1. Then, between 1997 and 2002, new strains of three different subtypes and five different genotypes emerged as causes of influenza among pigs in North America. In 1997–1998, H3N2 strains emerged. These strains, which include genes derived by reassortment from human, swine and avian viruses, have become a major cause of swine influenza in North America. Reassortment between H1N1 and H3N2 produced H1N2. In 1999 in Canada, a strain of H4N6 crossed the <b>species</b> <b>barrier</b> from birds to pigs, but was contained on a single farm.|$|E

Humans have developed a tolerance to these viruses, and most are infected {{with at least one}} species. Records of these milder virus infections are [...] rare, but it is likely that early hominids suffered from colds, influenza and diarrhoea caused by viruses just as humans do today. More recently evolved viruses cause epidemics and pandemics– and it is these that history records. [...] The influenza virus is one that seems to have crossed the <b>species</b> <b>barrier</b> from pigs to ducks and water fowl and hence to humans.

500|$|HIV {{crossed the}} <b>species</b> <b>barrier</b> between {{chimpanzees}} and humans in Africa {{in the early}} decades of the 20th century. During the years that followed there were enormous social changes and turmoil in Africa. Population shifts were unprecedented as vast numbers of people moved from rural farms to the expanding cities, and the virus was spread from remote regions to densely populated urban conurbations. The incubation period for AIDS is around 10 years, so a global epidemic starting in the early 1980s is credible. At this time there was much scapegoating and stigmatisation. The [...] "out of Africa" [...] theory for the origin of the HIV pandemic was not well received by Africans, who felt that the [...] "blame" [...] was misplaced. This led the World Health Assembly to pass a 1987 resolution, which stated that HIV is [...] "a naturally occurring [...] of undetermined geographic origin".|$|E

40|$|Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are {{neurological}} {{diseases that}} are associated with the conversion of the normal host-encoded prion protein (PrP-sen) to an abnormal protease-resistant form, PrP-res. Transmission of the TSE agent from one species to another is usually inefficient and accompanied by a prolonged incubation time. <b>Species</b> <b>barriers</b> to infection by the TSE agent are of particular importance given the apparent transmission of bovine spongiform encephalopathy to humans. Among the few animal species that appear to be resistant to infection by the TSE agent are rabbits. They survive challenge with the human kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jakob agents as well as with scrapie agent isolated from sheep or mice. <b>Species</b> <b>barriers</b> to the TSE agent are strongly influenced by the PrP amino acid sequence of both the donor and recipient animals. Here we show that rabbit PrP-sen does not form PrP-res in murine tissue culture cells persistently infected with the mouse-adapted scrapie agent. Unlike other TSE <b>species</b> <b>barriers</b> that have been studied, critical amino acid residues that inhibit PrP-res formation are located throughout the rabbit PrP sequence. Our results suggest that the resistance of rabbits to infection by the TSE agent is due to multiple rabbit PrP-specific amino acid residues that result in a PrP structure that is unable to refold to the abnormal isoform associated with disease...|$|R

40|$|It is {{believed}} that a novel coronavirus, {{severe acute respiratory syndrome}} coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was passed from palm civets to humans and caused the epidemic of SARS in 2002 to 2003. The major <b>species</b> <b>barriers</b> between humans and civets for SARS-CoV infections are the specific interactions between a defined receptor-binding domain (RBD) on a viral spike protein and its host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE 2). In this study a chimeric ACE 2 bearing the critical N-terminal helix from civet and the remaining peptidase domain from human was constructed, and it was shown that this construct has the same receptor activity as civet ACE 2. In addition, crystal structures of the chimeric ACE 2 complexed with RBDs from various human and civet SARS-CoV strains were determined. These structures, combined with a previously determined structure of human ACE 2 complexed with the RBD from a human SARS-CoV strain, have revealed a structural basis for understanding the major <b>species</b> <b>barriers</b> between humans and civets for SARS-CoV infections. They show that the major <b>species</b> <b>barriers</b> are determined by interactions between four ACE 2 residues (residues 31, 35, 38, and 353) and two RBD residues (residues 479 and 487), that early civet SARS-CoV isolates were prevented from infecting human cells due to imbalanced salt bridges at the hydrophobic virus/receptor interface, and that SARS-CoV has evolved to gain sustained infectivity for human cells by eliminating unfavorable free charges at the interface through stepwise mutations at positions 479 and 487.

40|$|The {{epidemics}} of bovine {{spongiform encephalopathy}} (BSE) several decades ago and present epidemics of chronic wasting disease (CWD) among cervids posed a threat of cross-species infections to humans or other animals. Therefore, {{the question as to}} the molecular nature of the <b>species</b> <b>barriers</b> to transmissibility of prion diseases is very important. We approached this problem theoretically, first developing a model of template-monomer interaction based on logical and topological grounds and on experimental data about cross-seeding of PrP 23 - 144 protein orthologs. Further, we propose that the strength of the cross-seeding barriers is proportional to dissimilarity of key amyloidogenic regions of the proteins. This dissimilarity can be measured by dissimilarity function we propose. Scaled on experimental data, this function predicts if cross-seeding can occur between different variants of PrP 23 - 144. The resemblance of PrP 23 - 144 cross-seeding barriers to the barriers of cross-species transmissibility of prion diseases is discussed.
