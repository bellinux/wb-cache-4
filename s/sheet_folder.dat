2500|$|The first Canadian {{passports}} {{were issued}} in 1862, following {{the outbreak of}} the American Civil War, when the United States demanded more secure identification from Canadians wishing to cross the border. They took the form of a [...] "Letter of Request" [...] from the Governor General of Canada. These documents remained in use until, in 1915, Canadian passports were first issued in the British format, a ten section single <b>sheet</b> <b>folder.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1934, {{the first}} {{official}} associate store opened in Hamilton, Ontario. In 1937, Canadian Tire moved into the new Main store at 837 Yonge Street, after completing extensive alterations to what once was the Grand Central Market. This location remains as an associate store in the chain today. The first Canadian Tire catalogue consisted of a price list in the format of a 24" [...] × 10" [...] folder. Sent in 1926 to car owners in Southern Ontario, this initial price <b>sheet</b> <b>folder</b> heralded {{the beginning of the}} Mail Order Department at Canadian Tire. Since then, the company has grown to over 487 stores. The company is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.|$|E

50|$|The reason WIMP {{interfaces}} {{have become}} so prevalent since their conception at Xerox PARC {{is that they are}} very good at abstracting work-spaces, documents, and their actions. Their analogous paradigm to documents as paper <b>sheets</b> or <b>folders</b> makes WIMP interfaces easy to introduce to other users. Furthermore their basic representations as rectangular regions on a 2D flat screen make them a good fit for system programmers, thus favoring the abundance of commercial widget toolkits in this style.|$|R
50|$|Indexing {{involves}} associating relevant keywords {{to files}} {{so that they}} can be retrieved by content. This process can sometimes be automated to some extent, but it often requires manual labour performed by data-entry clerks. One common practice is the use of barcode-recognition technology: during preparation, barcode <b>sheets</b> with <b>folder</b> names or index information are inserted into the document files, folders, and document groups. Using automatic batch scanning, the documents are saved into appropriate folders, and an index is created for integration into document-management systems.|$|R
5000|$|Photographic {{materials}} {{should always}} be covered when not in use. Storing film-based materials in containers and boxes will keep light away from the materials. When exhibiting or using these materials, a low light level should be used. The installation of low-UV-emitting bulbs or UV-absorbing fluorescent bulb sleeves can help eliminate this problem. UV filtering window glazing or the installation of window shades may also help. Low- UV-emitting bulbs and sleeves are available from several manufacturers. Light levels in storage areas can also be controlled {{by the use of}} timed shut-off switches. Dark cloths or <b>sheets</b> of <b>folder</b> stock (heavyweight paper) or mat board should be available in reading rooms for covering objects when not in use by readers.|$|R

5000|$|Employer hostility was not {{the only}} obstacle: The fact that some {{branches}} of the trade were falling while others were rising also complicated the early union’s plans. In the late 19th century assortment work - tinware that included household goods, cutlery, and cans, for instance - moved from shop to factory, and machine operators replaced apprentice-trained journeymen on the job. At the same time, though, the increasing use of galvanized sheet iron was creating opportunities for journeymen employed in furnace or architectural shops - demand for metal roofs, cornices, skylights, and ceilings, along with warm air furnaces and ventilation pipe, was on the rise by the late 19th century. In their case, labor-saving machinery, including <b>sheet</b> iron <b>folders,</b> or brakes, and cutting, rolling, and seaming machines, did not replace skill. But it did give rise to a new class of workmen that the Tin, Sheet Iron and Cornice Workers could not ignore: Semi-skilled specialists who produced materials for the trade. Although many local unions feared that admitting lower-waged members would undercut journeymen’s wages, a referendum vote in 1896 moved the organization forward. “The constitution of the tinners has been changed so as to admit all who work at sheet metal work into their unions,” the IA reported.” Henceforth, the Tin, Sheet Iron, and Cornice Workers’ International Association will be known as the Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers’ International Association.” ...|$|R

40|$|Studying up on {{septic systems}} often ranks last in {{importance}} with homeowners - until an emergency strikes. This cleverly designed fact sheet set not only describes {{what to do}} if your septic system fails, but also contains all the necessary information to understand how a septic system works, how to properly maintain a septic system [...] to prevent emergencies, and how to keep maintenance records [...] all in a tidy, clearly marked and easy to find, tabbed folder that fits in a filing cabinet or notebook. This resource is inexpensive, informative, practical, and it supports the concept and value of clean water quality standards and human health. A septic system is a critical component of a home, treating liquid waste in order to prevent contamination of drinking water and nearby lakes and streams. The folder itself not only acts as an organizational device to hold vital septic system information, but also doubles as a quick-tip guide, and a maintenance record worksheet. Each of the five fact <b>sheets</b> inside the <b>folder</b> speaks to a unique topic revolving around septic systems. Fact Sheet # 1, titled "What to Do if Your Septic System Fails", describes what a failure is, why failures happen, symptoms of a failure, immediate steps to take in case of a failure, long-term options, and prevention tips. Fact Sheet # 2, "Maintaining Your Septic System: Special Considerations for Shoreline Property Owners" addresses unique issues associated with homes built near lakes, streams, or ponds, including how to identify signs that contaminants are reaching the water, and how to prevent problems. Fact Sheet # 3, "How to Conserve Water in Your Home and Yard" offers 17 water saving tips that help reduce the risk of damaging your septic system, while saving money and protecting your health. Fact Sheet # 4, "What You Need to Know When Buying or Selling a House" provides a list and description of minimum evaluation criteria, as well as an easy-to-use worksheet to aid in your home-buying or selling decision. Fact Sheet # 5, "Considerations When Building or Remodeling a Home" covers siting your septic system, codes and permits, percolation tests, design and installation, and also includes a handy table for determining minimum septic tank capacities. "Your Septic System" was developed by Cornell Cooperative Extension Project Team members Martha G. Shortlidge, Westchester County; Jo Ellen Saumier, Rockland County; Marjorie L. Nichols Keith, Putnam County; and A. Meyer, Dutchess County; and {{supported by a grant from}} the Water Resources Institute at Cornell University, with funds provided from the NYS Department of Agriculture and Markets.

40|$|This {{collection}} contains mainly correspondence between {{staff of the}} JDC Landsmanshaftn Department and members of various landsmanshaftn, benevolent organizations of immigrants originally from the same communities, {{as well as between}} the Landsmanshaftn Department and the interest-free loan associations (gmilas khesed societies) and heads of the various Jewish communities, mostly in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The majority of the collection consists of correspondence with some newspaper clippings, photographs, committee meeting minutes, bank reports and receipts from the interest-free loan associations and from individual donors, official documentation about immigration and displaced persons, and a few programs and invitations from various events held by the landsmanshaftn. The materials date from 1926 to 1950 with the bulk dating from 1937 - 1939 and 1945 - 1949. Over 800 communities and countries are represented. Most of the documents for an individual community are in a single folder, however some communities have several folders. The majority of the collection is in English and Yiddish, although various official documents are in Polish, German, Russian, Spanish, French, and Arabic on the documents from various governmental and JDC offices around the world. Folders 41, 43, 117, 155, 234, 246, 307, and 353 contain some information about the activities of TOZ, the Society for the Protection of the Health of the Jewish Population in Poland, including some photographs. Many of the towns have several different names and different ways of spelling these names, depending upon what language is used and what system of transliteration, if any, is used. Most town names are listed by their Polish name and spelling in the container lists, although some folders have information about landsmanshaftn using a transliterated spelling, such as folder 43, labeled Brzesc and containing information about the Brisker Relief Society. Alternate names and spellings are in parentheses following the town name. Some of the folders are labeled according to the name of the landsmanshaft, although they are represented by the town name in the container list, such as folder 824, listed as Satanow but labeled as Satanover Sisterhood Bronx, for Child Transportation to Palestine. Some folders of towns that were known by different names or were so small that former occupants were part of the landsmanshaft of the closest larger town contain only a cross-reference <b>sheet,</b> such as <b>folder</b> 241, Lubar, directing the researcher to folder 378, Rowne. When one landsmanshaft serves multiple towns, the town names are divided by slash marks, such as folder 14, Bendzin (Bedzin) / Sosnowiec, which contains information about the landsmanshaft that serves both Bedzin and Sosnowiec. The materials are arranged chronologically in each folder. The sub-group consists of inter-office memoranda, general correspondence, correspondence with landsmanshaftn, reports from JDC regional offices, acknowledgements of contributions and other materials relating to the operation of the Landsmanshaftn Department (LD). The following series are included: 1. Records of the Landsmanshaftn Fraternal Division, 1937 - 40. Under this name the LD was re-established in 1937 to enlist the cooperation of the landsmanshaftn in the AJDC reconstruction program in Eastern Europe. Consists of LD-Landsmanshaftn correspondence; inter-office memoranda of Mrs. Henrietta Buchman, AJDC Assistant Exec. Secretary and Norman V. Gilimowsky, LD head; communications from local Loan Kassas in Poland and other Eastern European countries. 2. LD Post-World War II records, 1945 - 50 : Relate to generating aid for Holocaust survivors in Eastern Europe and DP camps; accepting earmarked contributions from the Landsmanshaftn for their landslayt abroad; locating relatives; aiding immigrants. Consists of: a. general correspondence and inter-office memoranda of Louis H.
