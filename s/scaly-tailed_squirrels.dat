5|$|<b>Scaly-tailed</b> <b>squirrels</b> {{and flying}} squirrels, {{although}} not closely related, can both glide {{from tree to}} tree using parachute-like membranes that stretch from the fore to the hind limbs. The agouti is fleet-footed and antelope-like, being digitigrade and having hoof-like nails. The majority of rodents have tails, which can be of many shapes and sizes. Some tails are prehensile, as in the Eurasian harvest mouse, and the fur on the tails can vary from bushy to completely bald. The tail is sometimes used for communication, as when beavers slap their tails on the water surface or house mice rattle their tails to indicate alarm. Some species have vestigial tails or no tails at all. In some species, the tail is capable of regeneration if a part is broken off.|$|E

50|$|Cyclops roundleaf bats {{spend the}} day {{roosting}} in hollow trees, often in cavities {{as far from the}} ground as possible. Roosting colonies are generally small, with no more than twelve individuals, including one to three males and a number of females, although a number of male bats roost alone. Roosting cavities are often shared with other animals, such as <b>scaly-tailed</b> <b>squirrels.</b>|$|E
50|$|The long-tailed hawk {{primarily}} eats squirrels, especially <b>scaly-tailed</b> <b>squirrels,</b> {{and small}} birds; {{it can also}} hunt chickens in the villages close to the forest. It kills prey by breaking the neck. Its strong legs and feet suggest its main prey are mammals. The mating season occurs in July and August, when the pair build a nest on a high tree. Little is known regarding nesting and breeding the young, an adult was seen feeding a fledged juvenile in Sierra Leone in August.|$|E
50|$|The {{tropical}} forests of Africa were little explored by Europeans before the nineteenth century. Colugos and flying squirrels {{had been known}} from south eastern Asia and gliding marsupials from Australia earlier than this, but {{the discovery of the}} <b>scaly-tailed</b> <b>squirrels</b> of equatorial Africa was not made till the 1840s. British zoologist and collector Louis Fraser exploring the Niger basin brought a specimen of Lord Derby's scaly-tailed squirrel (Anomalurus derbianus) back to Britain. Compared to the previously known flying squirrels, this had two rows of large scales {{on the underside of the}} basal part of its tail. The flying membrane stretched from wrist to ankle and was supported by a cartilaginous strip which had its origin at the elbow. (The east Asian flying squirrels have a similar cartilage strip, but it terminates at the wrist.) The scaly tailed squirrels had an additional membrane extending from the ankle to part-way along the tail, and when extended, the membrane formed a straight line from heel to heel.|$|E
50|$|Pel's flying <b>squirrel</b> or Pel's <b>scaly-tailed</b> <b>squirrel</b> (Anomalurus pelii) is {{a species}} of rodent in the family Anomaluridae. It is found in Liberia, Ivory Coast, and Ghana, where it lives in lowland {{tropical}} rainforests.|$|R
50|$|Lord Derby's <b>scaly-tailed</b> <b>squirrel</b> is nocturnal, {{and will}} sleep in nests in holes in trees. They live either {{alone or in}} pairs. They move around by {{extending}} their membrane and gliding from tree to tree. Flights of up to 250 meters (820 feet) have been recorded. They will use the scales {{on the bottom of}} their tails to help themselves climb in the trees. Lord Derby's <b>scaly-tailed</b> flying <b>squirrels</b> are mainly herbivorous, eating plant matter such as leaves, bark, green nuts, fruit and flowers.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} the nuclear {{organization of the}} cholinergic, catecholaminergic, serotonergic and orexinergic systems in the brains of the springhare and Beecroft's <b>scaly-tailed</b> <b>squirrel</b> following immunohistochemical labelling. We aimed to investigate any differences in the nuclear organization of these neural systems when compared to previous data on other species of rodents, as these two rodent species have relatively large brains − 1. 2 to 1. 4 times larger than would be expected for mammals of their body mass and 1. 7 – 1. 9 times larger than would be expected for rodents of their body mass. A series of coronal sections were taken through two brains of each species and immunohistochemically labelled with antibodies against choline acetyltransferase, tyrosine hydroxylase, serotonin and orexin-A. Generally, the nuclear complement of these systems revealed extensive similarities between both species and to previously studied rodents. While no differences were observed in the nuclear complement of the serotonergic and orexinergic systems, some differences were observed in the nuclear complement of the cholinergic and catecholaminergic systems. These include the presence of cholinergic neurons in the cerebral cortex and nucleus of the trapezoid body in the springhare; while the Beecroft's <b>scaly-tailed</b> <b>squirrel</b> exhibited cholinergic neurons in the pretectal area of the midbrain. For the catecholaminergic system {{it was observed that}} Beecroft's <b>scaly-tailed</b> <b>squirrel</b> possessed immunoreactive neurons in the accessory olfactory bulb. Despite these four differences, most not previously observed in rodents, the remaining complement of cholinergic and catecholaminergic nuclei were identical to that observed in other rodents, including the presence of the rodent specific catecholaminergic rostral dorsal midline medullary (C 3) nucleus in the medulla oblongata. Thus, even with a significant increase in relative brain size, the overall complement of nuclei forming these systems shows minimal changes in complexity within a specific mammalian order.

50|$|The dwarf <b>scaly-tailed</b> <b>squirrel</b> is {{native to}} {{tropical}} western and central Africa. As far as is known, there are two or more separate populations; one is in West Africa in Liberia, where one specimen was collected in the Du River Valley in {{the west of the}} country and two other specimens from Mount Richard-Molard in the north of the country; the other population is in Central Africa, the range including southern Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, northern Gabon, the Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, southwestern Central African Republic and eastern Uganda. It is possible that this rather unobtrusive species occurs in the intervening countries, with a single larger population. Although generally an animal of lowland primary rainforest, one specimen was collected at 2,200 m in Mugaba {{in the eastern part of}} the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is generally found in the interior of forests and not around the edges or in mosaic woodland.|$|R
25|$|Anomalures or <b>scaly-tailed</b> flying <b>squirrels</b> (family Anomaluridae) (gliding). These brightly {{coloured}} African rodents are not squirrels {{but have}} evolved to a resemble flying squirrels by convergent evolution. There are seven species, divided in three genera.

40|$|Bats were sampled {{in three}} forest {{reserves}} in Liberia using mist nets, a harp trap, and roost searches. Terrestrial small mammals were captured opportunistically {{and were not}} used in the final assessment of the forests. A total of 182 bats of 22 species were captured, representing 37 % of the bat species known to occur in Liberia. Species richness was highest at Gola and Grebo, possibly because secondary forest and forest edge was sampled there. North Lorma, where only forest interior was surveyed, had both the lowest capture success and the lowest species richness. Three IUCN Red List species were recorded: Rhinolophus hillorum (Vulnerable) in Gola, Scotonycteris zenkeri (Near Threatened) in Grebo, and Hipposideros fuliginosus (Near Threatened) in North Lorma. Bat assemblages {{in each of the}} surveyed areas were characterized by forest-dependent species. Not a single species typical of savanna habitats was recorded, indicating high habitat integrity of the reserves. Three species are reported for the first time from Liberia (Rhinolophus landeri, Neoromicia guineensis, Neoromicia aff. grandidieri), raising the species total for the country to 59. An updated checklist with corrected species identifications is presented for the bats of Liberia. Two species of shrews, one murid rodent, five squirrels and one anomalure (<b>scaly-tailed</b> <b>squirrel)</b> were also recorded, including the rarely reported Western Palm Squirrel Epixerus ebii and the Lesser Anomalure Anomalurus cf. pusillus...|$|R
50|$|Gliding {{has evolved}} {{independently}} {{in a variety}} of arboreal animals. Among mammals, there are the marsupial gliding possums of Australia, the colugos of SE Asia, and the <b>scaly-tailed</b> flying <b>squirrels</b> of Africa. Each group glides in a slightly different way, with their patagia being controlled by different morphological adaptations. In some marsupial gliders for example, the patagium attaches at the elbows, whereas in colugos it extends into webbed digits. The fact that all flying squirrels are “wrist gliders” with shared wrist anatomy suggests that they are all descended from a common ancestor, presumably some sort of primitive tree squirrel. Non-mammalian arboreal gliders include frogs, geckos, snakes, lizards, and even ants.|$|R
50|$|This {{is a small}} flying {{squirrel}}, {{with adults}} having a head-and-body length of 185 to 255 mm with a tail length of 120 to 200 mm. This flying squirrel weighs between 170 and 300 g. The head is grey, {{and there is no}} contrasting colour on the edges of the ears. The fur on the upper parts is very variable in colour, ranging from black, grizzled grey or olive brown to mottled tan. The upper side of the membranes are dark grey, with the membranes near the tail tinged with yellow. The underparts are creamy white or yellowish, without any hint of rufous. The tufts of bristles surrounding the hind claws are also white. As with other <b>scaly-tailed</b> flying <b>squirrels</b> in the genus Anomalurus, a membrane is attached between the thighs and the more basal part of the tail. This part of the tail bears a patch of large cornified scales on the underside, the rest of the tail being plume-like.|$|R
5000|$|To achieve gliding flight, it uses two {{membranes}} (patagia) which fold up {{when not}} in use. When the limbs are stretched wide in a star-shape, the membranes become taut and allow the rodent to glide from tree to tree. Being arboreal, Idiurus spends all of its time in the trees, living in hollow trunks in groups of 2 to 40. Limit information {{suggests that it is}} mainly frugivorous. [...] It has a long tail in proportion to its body, sporting two lines of raised scales, and patches of scaly skin to help it grip trees, but the rest of its body is furry. The tail is longer than the body and is also used to balance, like a primate's tail. Long-eared <b>scaly-tailed</b> flying <b>squirrels</b> are about 20 cm long and weigh 30g. In comparison, the body of a common household mouse is approximately 10 cm long and its tail is approximately 5 cm.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Phylogenetic {{relationships}} between Lagomorpha, Rodentia and Primates {{and their allies}} (Euarchontoglires) have long been debated. While it is now generally agreed that Rodentia constitutes a monophyletic sister-group of Lagomorpha and that this clade (Glires) is sister to Primates and Dermoptera, higher-level relationships within Rodentia remain contentious. Results We have sequenced and performed extensive evolutionary analyses on the mitochondrial genome of the <b>scaly-tailed</b> flying <b>squirrel</b> Anomalurus sp., an enigmatic rodent whose phylogenetic affinities have been obscure and extensively debated. Our phylogenetic analyses of the coding regions of available complete mitochondrial genome sequences from Euarchontoglires suggest that Anomalurus is a sister taxon to the Hystricognathi, and that this clade represents the most basal divergence among sampled Rodentia. Bayesian dating methods incorporating a relaxed molecular clock provide divergence-time estimates which are consistently {{in agreement with the}} fossil record and which indicate a rapid radiation within Glires around 60 million years ago. Conclusion Taken together, the data presented provide a working hypothesis as to the phylogenetic placement of Anomalurus, underline the utility of mitochondrial sequences in the resolution of even relatively deep divergences and go some way to explaining the difficulty of conclusively resolving higher-level relationships within Glires with available data and methodologies. </p...|$|R
