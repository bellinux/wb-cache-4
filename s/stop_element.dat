40|$|This paper {{develops}} a locomotive dynamic model {{to study the}} coupler compressed stability and locomotive running safety under severe longitudinal compressive forces, taking into account {{a new model of}} the flattened pin coupler and buffer system employed by heavy-haul locomotives. In this new model, the arc surface contact friction element is built up {{for the first time to}} simulate the compressed contact friction process between the arc surfaces of the coupler tail and the following plate. An improved nonlinear mathematical model of buffers and a coupler rotation angle <b>stop</b> <b>element</b> are also included. After validating the presented locomotive dynamic model by comparing its calculated results with test data, simulations are carried out to analyse the influences of the coupler-tail arc surface and locomotive secondary suspension parameters on the coupler compressed stability and locomotive running safety. Results indicate that the friction coefficient and the arc radius of the coupler-tail arc surfaces have a remarkable influence, and that the locomotive secondary lateral stop and lateral stiffness also have a significant effect. Optimising these parameters could significantly improve the coupler compressed stability and locomotive running safety. Finally, a real example of Chinese heavy-haul trains is shown to confirm the importance of the coupler-tail contact friction action...|$|E
40|$|The Mdm 2 and Mdm 4 oncoproteins are key {{negative}} regulators of the p 53 tumor suppressor. However, their physiological {{contributions to}} the regulation of p 53 stability and activity remain highly controversial. Here, we combined a p 53 knock-in allele, in which p 53 is silenced by a transcriptional <b>stop</b> <b>element</b> flanked by loxP sites, with the Mdm 2 - and Mdm 4 -null alleles. This approach allows Cre-mediated conditional p 53 expression in tissues in vivo and cells in vitro lacking Mdm 2, Mdm 4, or both. Using this strategy, we show that Mdm 2 and Mdm 4 are essential in a nonredundant manner for preventing p 53 activity in the same cell type (Mouse Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs), neuronal progenitor cells and postmitotic neurons) and irrespective of the proliferation/differentiation status of the cells. Although Mdm 2 prevents accumulation of the p 53 protein, Mdm 4 contributes to the overall inhibition of p 53 activity independent of Mdm 2. We propose a model in which Mdm 2 is critical for the regulation of p 53 levels and Mdm 4 is critical for the fine-tuning of p 53 transcriptional activity, both proteins acting synergistically to keep p 53 in check. Finally, we show that neither Mdm 2 nor Mdm 4 regulate cell cycle progression independently {{of its ability to}} modulate p 53 function.

40|$|The CB 1 {{cannabinoid}} receptor {{is the most}} abundant G-protein coupled receptor {{in the brain and}} a key regulator of neuronal excitability. There is strong evidence that CB 1 receptor on glutamatergic hippocampal neurons is beneficial to alleviate epileptiform seizures in mouse and man. Therefore, we hypothesized that experimentally increased CB 1 gene dosage in principal neurons would have therapeutic effects in kainic acid (KA) -induced hippocampal pathogenesis. Here, we show that virus-mediated conditional overexpression of CB 1 receptor in pyramidal and mossy cells of the hippocampus is neuroprotective and moderates convulsions in the acute KA seizure model in mice. We introduce a recombinant adenoassociated virus (AAV) genome with a short <b>stop</b> <b>element</b> flanked by loxP sites, for highly efficient attenuation of transgene expression on the transcriptional level. The presence of Cre-recombinase is strictly necessary for expression of reporter proteins or CB 1 receptor in vitro and in vivo. Transgenic CB 1 receptor immunoreactivity is targeted to glutamatergic neurons after stereotaxic delivery of AAV to the dorsal hippocampus of the driver mice NEX-cre. Increased CB 1 receptor protein levels in hippocampal lysates of AAV-treated Cre-mice is paralleled by enhanced cannabinoid-induced G-protein activation. KA-induced seizure severity and mortality is reduced in CB 1 receptor overexpressors compared with AAV-treated control animals. Neuronal damage in the hippocampal CA 3 field is specifically absent from AAV-treated Cre-transgenics, but evident throughout cortical areas of both treatment groups.

40|$|The high-affinity {{siderophore}} salicylate is {{an intermediate}} in the biosynthetic pathway of pyochelin, another siderophore and chelator of transition metal ions, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The 2. 5 -kb region upstream of the salicylate biosynthetic genes pchBA was sequenced {{and found to}} contain two additional, contiguous genes, pchD and pchC, having the same orientation. The deduced amino acid sequence of the 60 -kDa PchD protein was {{similar to those of}} the EntE protein (2, 3 -dihydroxybenzoate-AMP ligase) of Escherichia coli and other adenylate-forming enzymes, suggesting that salicylate might be adenylated at the carboxyl group by PchD. The 28 -kDa PchC protein showed similarities to thioesterases of prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin and might participate in the release of the product(s) formed from activated salicylate. One potential product, dihydroaeruginoate (Dha), was identified in culture supernatants of iron-limited P. aeruginosa cells. The antifungal antibiotic Dha is thought to arise from the reaction of salicylate with cysteine, followed by cyclization of cysteine. Inactivation of the chromosomal pchD gene by insertion of the transcription and translation <b>stop</b> <b>element</b> omega Sm/Sp abolished the production of Dha and pyochelin, implying that PchD-mediated activation of salicylate may be a common first step in the synthesis of both metabolites. Furthermore, the pchD::omega Sm/Sp mutation had a strong polar effect on the expression of the pchBA genes, i. e., on salicylate synthesis, indicating that the pchDCBA genes constitute a transcriptional unit. A full-length pchDCBA transcript of ca. 4. 4 kb could be detected in iron-deprived, growing cells of P. aeruginosa. Transcription of pchD started at tandemly arranged promoters, which overlapped with two Fur boxes (binding sites for the ferric uptake regulator) and the promoter of the divergently transcribed pchR gene encoding an activator of pyochelin biosynthesis. This promoter arrangement allows tight iron-mediated repression of the pchDCBA operon...|$|E
40|$|Mast {{cells are}} well known {{effector}} cells in allergic disorders. In the recent years, however, mast cells were demonstrated to play pivotal roles in initiating and modulating innate and adaptive immune responses. The animal models available until today for the investigation of mast cell functions are primarily the Kit-mutant KitW/Wv and KitWsh/Wsh mouse strains. These mice are devoid of mast cells and can be reconstituted with mast cells from gene deficient mice. The phenotypic abnormalities, apart from mast cell deficiency, e. g. the profound perturbation of the hematopoietic system, however, limit the utility of these strains. Aiming at new models of mast cell-specific gene inactivation in vivo and of mast cell-deficiency, the Cre/loxP system was applied to allow Cre-mediated mutagenesis selectively in mast cells. BAC (bacterial artificial chromosome) transgenic animals were successfully generated that display Cre expression {{under the control of}} either the Mcpt 5 or Mcpt 6 promoter. Cre-mediated recombination as assessed by reporter gene expression in Mcpt 5 -Cre or Mcpt 6 -Cre R 26 R-EYFP double positive mice was found to be highly efficient in peritoneal and skin mast cells, but was not found in hematopoietic cell populations other than mast cells. Thus, the new mast cell-specific Cre transgenic mouse lines will provide useful tools for the investigation of mast cell-specific functions of individual genes. Furthermore, the Mcpt 5 -Cre strain was used to establish a new model for inducible ablation of mast cells in adult mice. By crossing this line to the iDTR strain, which expresses the high affinity diphtheria toxin receptor (DTR) after Cre-mediated deletion of a <b>stop</b> <b>element,</b> mast cells were rendered diphtheria toxin (DT) sensitive. DT treatment of Mcpt 5 -Cre iDTR double positive mice resulted in successful ablation of connective tissue type mast cells (CTMC), but not of mucosal mast cells (MMC). The depletion of CTMC resulted in significant reduction of a passive, systemic anaphylactic response demonstrating that this system for mast cell ablation represents a useful model for the investigation of mast cell functions during immune responses. Interestingly, the repopulation of the peritoneal cavity and the skin with mast cells after DT-mediated mast cell depletion followed a very slow kinetic with a noteworthy recurrence of peritoneal mast cells three months after DT treatment. Skin mast cells do not return significantly within a period of four months. Thus, the long persistence of the mast cell-depleted state allows the application of this system for long-term experiments and should provide new insights into the mechanisms of mast cell homeostasis and recruitment...|$|E

40|$|Mdm 2 and Mdm 4 are {{critical}} negative regulators of the p 53 tumor suppressor. Mdm 4 -null mutants are severely anemic and exhibit impaired proliferation of the fetal liver erythroid lineage cells. This phenotype may indicate a cell-intrinsic function of Mdm 4 in erythropoiesis. In contrast, {{red blood cell}} count was nearly normal in mice engineered to express low levels of Mdm 2, suggesting that Mdm 2 might be dispensable for red cell production. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, we further explore the tissue-specific functions of Mdm 2 and Mdm 4 in the erythroid lineage by crossing the conditional Mdm 4 and Mdm 2 alleles to an erythroid-specific-cre (EpoRGFP-Cre) knock-in allele. Our data show that Mdm 2 is required for rescuing erythroid progenitors from p 53 -mediated apoptosis during primitive erythropoiesis. In contrast, Mdm 4 is only required for the high erythropoietic rate during embryonic definitive erythropoiesis. Thus, in this particular cellular context, interestingly, Mdm 4 only contributes to p 53 regulation at a specific phase of the differientation program. Moreover, a large body of evidence indicates that aberrant expression of either MDM 2 or MDM 4 impairs p 53 tumor suppression function and consequently favors tumor formation. Overexpression of MDM 2 was observed in 10 % of 8000 human cancers from various sites, including lung or stomach, and MDM 4 was found amplified and/or overexpressed in 10 - 20 % of over 800 diverse tumors including lung, colon, stomach and breast cancers. Remarkably, selective MDM 4 amplification occurs in about 65 % of human retinoblastomas. In contrast, MDM 2 amplifications are relatively rare (about 5 %) in retinoblastomas, indicating that depending on the tumor context (cell type, initiating oncogene, …), MDM 4, rather than MDM 2, overexpression might be selected for as a more efficient mean of suppression of p 53 function. As part of a large effort to better understand why different cell types require distinct combinations of mutations to form tumours, we will examine the molecular basis for selective up-regulation of Mdm 4 in retinoblastomas. In this context, we have successfully generated 2 conditional transgenic mouse lines expressing either mycMdm 2 or mycMdm 4 driven by the PCAGGs promoters in the ROSA 26 locus. Since a cassette containing a floxed transcriptional <b>stop</b> <b>element</b> is inserted upstream of the transgenes, we can achieve tissue-specific expression and spatio-temporal regulation of the transgenes by using different Cre and CreER. By the use of N-terminal myc-tag fused with the transgenes, we are able to compare the expression levels of the transgenes. Finally, due to C-terminal IRES-GFP element, we can easily identify transgene expressing cells. One of our aims is to use this Mdm 4 conditional transgenic mouse line as the first, non-chimeric, mouse model of retinoblastoma that can be used as an appropriate preclinical model to improve treatment of this disease.

They employ the Vapotron effect, a two phase complex heat transfer mechanism. The physics of operation of the device are not well understood and {{are believed to be}} strongly linked to the evolution of the flow fields of coolant flowing inside the grooves that form part of the design. An experimental study of the spatial and temporal behaviour of the flow field under isothermal conditions has been carried out on two replicas of HyperVapotron geometries taken from the Mega Amp Spherical Tokamak (MAST) and the Joint European Torus (JET) experiments. The models were tested under three isothermal operating conditions to collect coolant flow data and assess how the design and operational conditions might affect the thermal performance of the devices for single phase heat transfer. It was discovered that the in-groove speeds of MAST are lower and the flow structures less stable but less sensitive to free stream speed perturbations compared to the JET geometry. The MAST geometry was found to suffer from hydrodynamic end effects. A wake formation was discovered {{at the top of the}} groove entrance for the JET geometry, while this is absent from the MAST geometry.
