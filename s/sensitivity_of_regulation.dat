40|$|This paper {{develops}} a rational expectations framework to analyze how rating agencies’ incentives are altered when ratings {{are used for}} regulatory purposes such as bank capital requirements. <b>Regulations</b> <b>of</b> this kind imply that the AAA label of a security is valuable to a regulated investor independent of the information it provides about the riskiness of the security’s underlying cash flows. Our model predicts that a profit maximizing rating agency responds to this regulatory environment by partially inflating the AAA rating class and by reducing information acquisition relative to a (counter-factual) situation without regulation. The equilibrium precision of a rating trades-off two conflicting purposes: (a) the reduction of information asymmetries between issuers and investors, and (b) the support of "regulatory arbitrage". Rating inflation {{can be related to}} regulatory changes that increase the <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> <b>regulations</b> to ratings.

We have examined the thermal <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> intracellular pH <b>regulation</b> in the heart. To do this we determined the temperature <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> pHi, intracellular buffering capacity, and the activity of sarcolemmal acid-extrusion proteins, Na+-H+ exchange (NHE) and Na+-HCO 3 − co-transport (NBC) in guinea-pig isolated ventricular myocytes. pHi was recorded fluorimetrically with acetoxymethyl (AM) -loaded carboxy-SNARF- 1 at either 27 or 37 °C. At 27 °C, intrinsic (non-CO 2 -dependent) buffering power (βi) was ˜ 60 % of that at 37 °C. Acid-extrusion (Je) through NHE was ˜ 50 % slower than at 37 °C, consistent with a Q 10 of ˜ 2. In 5 % CO 2 /HCO 3 −-buffered conditions, {{in the presence of}} 30 μm cariporide to inhibit NHE, acid extrusion via NBC was also slowed at 27 °C, suggestive of a comparable Q 10. Resting pHi at 27 °C was similar in Hepes- or 5 % CO 2 /HCO 3 −-buffered superfusates but, in both cases, was ˜ 0. 1 pH units lower at 37 °C. The higher the starting pHi, the larger was the thermally induced fall of pHi, consistent with a mathematical model where intrinsic buffers with a low principal pKa (e. g. close to 6. 0) are less temperature-sensitive than those with a higher pKa.

40|$|Adaptation {{to stress}} in {{vertebrates}} occurs via activation of hormonal and neuronal signaling cascades in which corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) plays a central role. Expression of brain CRH {{is subject to}} strong, brain-region specific regulation by glucocorticoid hormones and neurogenic intracellular signals. We hypothesized that Steroid Receptor Coactivator 1 (SRC- 1), a transcriptional coregulator of the glucocorticoid receptor, {{is involved in the}} <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> CRH <b>regulation</b> by stress-related factors. In the brains of SRC- 1 knockout mice we found basal CRH mRNA levels to be lower in the central nucleus of the amygdala. Hypothalamic CRH up-regulation after chronic (but not acute) stress, as well as region-dependent up- and down-regulation induced by synthetic glucocorticoids, were significantly attenuated compared with wild type. The impaired induction of the crh gene by neurogenic signals was corroborated in AtT- 20 cells, where siRNA and overexpression experiments showed that SRC- 1 is necessary for full induction of a CRH promoter reporter gene by forskolin, suggestive of involvement of transcription factor CREB. In conclusion, SRC- 1 is involved in positive and negative <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> the crh gene, and an important factor for the adaptive capacity of stress...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{the marked}} {{influence}} on neuronal physiology of the low-voltage activated T-type Ca(2 +) currents, {{little is known}} about the intracellular pathways and neurotransmitters involved in their regulations. Here, we report that in thalamocortical neurons a phosphorylation mechanism induces an increase both in the current amplitude (1. 5 +/- 0. 27 -fold in the ventrobasal nucleus) and its inactivation kinetics. Dialysis of the neuron with an ATP-free solution suppresses the T-current potentiation, whereas it becomes irreversible in the presence of ATPgammaS. Phosphorylation occurs when the channels are inactivated and is slowly removed when they recover from inactivation and remain in closed states (time constants of the induction and removal of the potentiation: 579 +/- 143 msec and 4. 9 +/- 1. 1 sec, respectively, at 25 degrees C). The resulting apparent voltage <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> this <b>regulation</b> follows the voltage dependence of the current steady-state inactivation. Thus, the current is paradoxically inhibited when the preceding hyperpolarization is lengthened, and maximal currents are generated after transient hyperpolarizations with a duration (0. 7 - 1. 5 sec) that is defined by the balance between the kinetics of the dephosphorylation and deinactivation. In addition, the phosphorylation will facilitate the generation of T current at resting membrane potential. This potentiation, which is specific to sensory thalamocortical neurons, would markedly influence the electroresponsiveness of these neurons and represent the first evidence <b>of</b> a <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> native Cav 3. 1 channels...|$|R
40|$|Rationale: AMP-activated {{protein kinase}} (AMPK) is an {{important}} regulator of energy balance and signaling in the heart. Mutations affecting the regulatory γ 2 subunit {{have been shown to}} cause an essentially cardiac-restricted phenotype of hypertrophy and conduction disease, suggesting a specific role for this subunit in the heart. Objective: The γ isoforms are highly conserved at their C-termini but have unique N-terminal sequences, and we hypothesized that the N-terminus of γ 2 may be involved in conferring substrate specificity or in determining intracellular localization. Methods and Results: A yeast 2 -hybrid screen of a human heart cDNA library using the N-terminal 273 residues of γ 2 as bait identified cardiac troponin I (cTnI) as a putative interactor. In vitro studies showed that cTnI is a good AMPK substrate and that Ser 150 is the principal residue phosphorylated. Furthermore, on AMPK activation during ischemia, Ser 150 is phosphorylated in whole hearts. Using phosphomimics, measurements of actomyosin ATPase in vitro and force generation in demembraneated trabeculae showed that modification at Ser 150 resulted in increased Ca <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> contractile <b>regulation.</b> Treatment <b>of</b> cardiomyocytes with the AMPK activator 5 -aminoimidazole- 4 -carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) resulted in increased myocyte contractility without changing the amplitude of Ca transient and prolonged relaxation despite shortening the time constant of Ca transient decay (tau). Compound C prevented the effect of AICAR on myocyte function. These results suggest that AMPK activation increases myocyte contraction and prolongs relaxation by increasing myofilament Ca sensitivity.

40|$|Cardiac {{troponin}} I (cTnI) is the inhibitory {{component of}} the troponin complex and {{is involved in the}} calcium control of heart muscle contraction. Recently, specific missense mutations of the cTnI gene (TNNI 3) have been shown to cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). We have analyzed the functional effects of two HCM mutations (R 145 G and R 162 W) using purified recombinant cTnI. Both mutations gave reduced inhibition of actin-tropomyosin-activated myosin ATPase, both in experiments using cTnI alone and in those using reconstituted human cardiac troponin under relaxing conditions. Both mutant troponin complexes also conferred increased calcium <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> ATPase <b>regulation.</b> Studies on wild type/R 145 G mutant mixtures showed that the wild type phenotype was dominant in that the inhibition and the calcium sensitivity conferred by a 50 : 50 mixture was more similar to wild type than expected. Surface plasmon resonance-based assays showed that R 162 W mutant had an increased affinity for troponin C in the presence of calcium. This observation may contribute to the increased calcium sensitivity found with this mutant and also corroborates recent structural data. The observed decreased inhibition and increased calcium sensitivity suggest that these mutations may cause HCM via impaired relaxation rather than the impaired contraction seen with some other classes of HCM mutants...|$|R

40|$|Aim: Posttraumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD), {{major depressive disorder}} (MDD), and severe fatigue may develop in response to severe stress and trauma. These conditions have all {{been shown to be}} associated with altered <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> leukocytes for <b>regulation</b> by glucocorticoids (GCs). However, it remains unknown whether <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> leukocytes for GCs is a pre-existing vulnerability factor, or whether GC-sensitivity of leukocytes alters as a consequence of stress and stress-related conditions. Our aim was to investigate whether <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> T-cells and monocytes for regulation by GCs (i. e. dexamethasone: DEX) assessed before military deployment predicts high levels of PTSD, depressive, and/or fatigue symptoms 6 months after return from deployment. Methods: We included 526 male military personnel before deployment to Afghanistan. Logistic regression analysis was performed to predict fatigue, depressive, and PTSD symptoms 6 months after deployment based on <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> LPS-induced TNF-alpha production and PHA-induced T-cell proliferation to DEX-inhibition before deployment. Results: Severe fatigue 6 months after deployment was independently associated with low DEX-sensitivity of monocyte TNF-alpha production before deployment. A high level of depressive symptoms after deployment was independently associated with a low DEX-sensitivity of T-cell proliferation. In contrast, a high level of PTSD symptoms after deployment was independently associated with a high DEX-sensitivity of T-cell proliferation before deployment, but only in individuals who reported PTSD symptoms without depressive symptoms. The predictive value of DEX-sensitivity was independent of childhood trauma and GR number, GR subtype and GR target gene mRNA expression in leukocytes. Conclusions: We present {{here for the first time}} that the <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> leukocytes for GCs prior to deployment is a predictive factor for the development of PTSD, depressive and fatigue symptomatology in response to deployment. Notably, PTSD, depressive and fatigue symptoms were differentially associated with GC-sensitivity of monocytes and T-cells and therefore may have different biological underpinnings.

The hetero-octameric complex of a sulphonylurea receptor (SUR 2 B) and an inwardly rectifying Kþ channel (Kir 6. 1) and the corresponding native channel in smooth muscle are relatively insensitive to variations in intracellular ATP. Activation of these channels in blood vessels during hypoxia/ischaemia {{is thought to be}} mediated via hormonal regu-lation such as cellular adenosine release or the release of mediators from the endothelium. In contrast, intracellular ATP prominently inhibits Kir 6. 2 containing complexes, such as those present in cardiac myocytes.

It is the aim of this work to explore whether the subunit composition of the Slick/Slack heteromeric channel affects the response to osmotic challenges.

Indeed, the sound and playing characteristics of historical instruments are often very {{different from those of}} the instruments we are used to. For example, in the case of the Viennese piano actions used by Mozart and his contemporaries, the so-called “escapement height” largely conditions the response of the instrument to the pianist’s touch. In this contribution, we aim to define how the Viennese action behaves when the escapement height, usually tuned by piano technicians, is changed. To do this, a multibody model containing the frame, the key, the hammer, the pawl, and the string has been developed. This paper describes how the model has been carried out; a special focus is put on the detection of the intermittent contacts between bodies, which may look easy in the real action, but is rather complex to model. The model is compared with high-speed imaging data and a parametric study of the escapemen height is performed by adjusting the rest position of the pawl.

40|$|Background: Arterial baroreceptor reflex is an {{important}} mechanism of short-term blood pressure regulation. Arterial baroreceptors {{are located in the}} carotid artery and aortic arch walls. After afferent baroreceptor signal is processed in medulla oblongata, efferent signals are transmitted to heart and blood vessels by sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. Baroreflex <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> heart rate <b>regulation</b> indicates the degree of change in heart rate (or R – R interval) for a given unit change of systolic blood pressure. It can be measured by traditional laboratory methods which are invasive. Modern noninvasive techniques for baroreflex sensitivity assessment are based on spontaneous baroreflex modulation of heart rate. Conclusions: Baroreflex sensitivity decreases with aging, increasing heart rate, increased body mass index, after prolonged bed rest and under conditions of weightlessness. Conversely, it increases during sleep and after regular physical training. Moreover, baroreflex sensitivity is decreased in arterial hypertension, heart failure and in the post-myocardial infarction phase. Decreased baroreflex sensitivity represents an independent risk factor for sudden cardiac death in heart failure patients and after myocardial infarction. </p...|$|R

Development of such therapeutic strategies relies on a comprehensive understanding <b>of</b> the underlying <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> the neurogenic process. To this end, I show, in this thesis, that cultured post-natal hippocampal neural progenitor cells (NPCs) express a specific repertoire of connexins (Cx), a family of channel forming proteins critical for communication prior to the development of functional chemical synapses. I show that this pattern of Cx expression, specifically Cx 43 and Cx 45, is modulated by interaction with the extracellular matrix component laminin providing evidence of extracellular matrix-cell interaction in the <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> intrinsic Cx expression and function in postnatal NPCs. In adult brain, I show, for the first time, that Cx 45 localizes to all cell types of the neuronal lineage {{with the exception of the}} type 3 doublecortin (DCX) -positive NPCs. Using a loss of function approach, I show that this expression is required for the normal proliferation of type 1 nestin and glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive stem like NPCs but not for the differentiation or survival of their progeny in the adult hippocampus. With respect to exogenous pharmacological cues that influence hippocampal neurogenesis, this thesis also demonstrates that chronic treatment with a sub-set of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, fluoxetine and escitalopram, increases the proliferation but not the survival of adult NPCs in healthy, non-depressed mice. Further, standard post-operative analgesia with the opiate buprenorphine inhibits the proliferation of DCX-positive adult NPCs and increases the survival of their progeny. Finally, over the course of the research for this thesis, it became clear that exposing research animals to even very subtle environmental changes can influence the basal neurogenic process. Ultimately this work further highlights the exquisite <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> what is already recognized to be a highly dynamic process and provides important insight into the neurogenic process that can be used to inform future therapeutic development and application...|$|R

For cells isolated {{in the absence of}} IGF- 1, pH(i) recovery following acidification was predominantly mediated by NHE 1.

NHE 3 activity was not detected in IGF- 1 -treated cells that had been incubated with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, although NHE 1 activity was unaffected. In the absence of IGF- 1, suspension in hyperosmotic solutions or raised hydrostatic pressure enhanced pH(i) recovery of acidified cells. This response was missing in cells incubated with IGF- 1. Unresponsiveness to hyperosmotic shock represented inhibition of NHE 3 activity, and was prevented using the protein kinase A inhibitor KT 5720.

40|$|Posttraumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that may develop {{in response to}} a traumatic event. Approximately 10 % of trauma-exposed individuals subsequently develop PTSD. It is hypothesized that the development of PTSD is associated with biological vulnerability factors, which are already present prior to the onset of symptoms. In this review we present an overview of currently identified vulnerability factors in the glucocorticoid (GC) signaling pathway for the development of PTSD. In addition, the implications of the identified vulnerability factors for potential preventive intervention strategies, including glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonists and oxytocin, are discussed. Summarized, the findings of these studies indicate that individuals vulnerable for development of PTSD have dysregulations on various levels of the GC-signaling cascade: i. e. low levels of circulating levels of cortisol shortly after trauma, high GR number in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), high GILZ mRNA expression and low FKBP 5 expression in PBMCs prior to trauma, and high <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> T-cells for <b>regulation</b> by GCs prior to trauma.

Methods : We included a cohort of 1, 032 Dutch soldiers prior to deployment to Afghanistan. GR pathway components were assessed in blood collected prior to deployment. PTSD symptoms were assessed 6 months after return. Results : A high GR number, high GILZ mRNA expression, and low FKBP 5 mRNA expression in leukocytes prior to deployment were independently associated with development of high levels of PTSD symptoms. In addition, <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> T-cells for <b>regulation</b> by the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone was associated with development of high levels of PTSD symptoms. However, the direction of the association between dexamethasone-sensitivity and PTSD depended on the presence of co-morbid depressive symptoms. Conclusions : Altered functioning of the GR pathway in leukocytes is a vulnerability factor for development of high levels of PTSD symptoms. The identification of such biological vulnerability factors for PTSD could facilitate the selection of individuals for preventive treatment within groups at risk for trauma-exposure...|$|R
40|$|The {{lifespan}} of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans {{is regulated}} by sensory signals detected by the amphid neurons. In these neurons, C. elegans expresses at least 14 Galpha subunits and a Ggamma subunit. We have identified seven sensory Galpha subunits that modulate lifespan. Genetic experiments suggest that multiple sensory signaling pathways exist that modulate lifespan {{and that some}} G proteins function in multiple pathways, most of which, but probably not all, involve insulin/IGF- 1 like signaling. Interestingly, of the sensory G proteins involved in regulating lifespan, only one Galpha probably functions directly in the detection of sensory cues. The other G proteins seem to function in modulating the <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> the sensory neurons. We hypothesize {{that in addition to}} the mere detection <b>of</b> sensory cues, <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> sensory neurons also plays a role in the <b>regulation</b> <b>of</b> lifespan...|$|R

Theoretical {{framework}} for monetary transmission mechanism and hence for bank lending channel provides straightforward impacts of monetary policy on aggregate output, however {{there is a}} problem of identification for these impacts with aggregate data. Using a two-staged approach, the thesis studies the loan growth <b>sensitivities</b> <b>of</b> banks in the new regulatory system in Turkey and tries to identify a relationship between loan growth sensitivity and monetary tightening. There are six alternative sensitivities tested in the thesis: (1) Liquidity <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> bank loan growth, (2) Income <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> bank loan growth, (3) Liquidity <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> bank loan growth with ownership type of banks controlled, (4) Liquidity <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> large banks loan growth, (5) Liquidity <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> small banks loan growth. (6) Liquidity <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> bank loan growth with foreign affiliation of banks controlled. Results confirm that there exists a positive relationship between liquidity <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> loan growth of Turkish banks and monetary policy shocks. Results also show that small banks are more liquidity dependent during contradictionary monetary policy periods than large banks. Besides the results parallel to empirical findings in the literature, characteristics of Turkish banking sector are included in the discussion such as the influence of BRSA on banks and the impacts <b>of</b> its <b>regulations.</b> Robustness <b>of</b> the tests are checked with additional econometric models. Hence, the findings suggest that there are evidences on bank lending channel in Turkey for the period 1998 - 2009. Kuşakcıoğlu, Zeynep GözdeM. S...|$|R

The analysis examines the <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> the results to specification issues {{that have not been}} investigated previously. In the best-fitting models that survive an extensive set of specification tests, group size and child-staff ratio have small impacts on the quality of care provided. The effects of staff education and training are typically small as well. The results raise questions about the knowledge base on which to make policy recommendations concerning the benefits <b>of</b> <b>regulations</b> and subsidies intended {{to improve the quality of}} child care. ...|$|R

The surveillance aims at detecting the parasite, if present, in mainland Norway. The Norwegian surveillance reports were assessed by checking {{the description of the}} surveillance system for completeness against the relevant elements {{that need to be addressed}} in assessing the quality of E. multilocularis surveillance reports in the context <b>of</b> <b>Regulation</b> (EU) No 1152 / 2011. The data reported on individual samples were assessed using the raw data submitted by Norway via the EFSA Data Collection Framework (DCF). Descriptive statistics were calculated to check whether the requirements <b>of</b> <b>Regulation</b> (EU) No 1152 / 2011 had been fulfilled. The E. multilocularis-specific surveillance programme aimed at detecting the parasite, if present in mainland Norway, has not detected E. multilocularis through the surveillance activities performed in 2012 and 2013. Under the assumption of unbiased representative sampling and considering the <b>sensitivity</b> <b>of</b> the tests applied, Norway has fulfilled the requirement <b>of</b> <b>Regulation</b> (EU) No 1152 / 2011 to the effect that the surveillance activities should detect a prevalence of E. multilocularis of 1 % or less at a confidence level of at least 0. 95 in 2012, but not in 2013...|$|R
