25|$|Reactor R2 went {{critical}} in 1960. In 1963, FOA halted criticality experiments, and by July 1972, even theoretical research using its acquired plutonium was shut down. Earlier, {{primarily due to}} cost, Sweden opted to use U.S.-designed light water reactors using imported enriched uranium in lieu of heavy water reactors operating on indigenous uranium. Also, the Swedish supreme commander announced that the country abandoned the nuclear option in 1965. Another key event was an electrical problem at the Ågesta that jeopardized the reactor’s cooling system. Although a meltdown was averted, the Swedish government was informed. The public, however, was {{kept in the dark}} until 1993, as the government was afraid that such a disclosure would endanger public support for nuclear energy. The year 1974 also marked the final disassembly of all plutonium facilities and a reorganization of FOA that dispersed its nuclear expertise. The Ågesta reactor was permanently shut down. Vattenfall, the contractor responsible for the Marviken reactor, became increasingly skeptical of the project’s chances for success. Two key areas were mentioned: the idea of using superheated water and the reshuffling machine. Additionally, it became apparent that the plant would not satisfy the safety standards established by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission in the late 1960s. By 1969, the plans to build a <b>superheated</b> <b>reactor</b> were scrapped.|$|R

40|$|The {{conceptual}} {{design of the}} Coupled Breeding <b>Superheating</b> <b>Reactor,</b> CBSR, for achieving a positive breeding gain and for producing 65 Mw of electric power is presented. The design combines a steam-cooled fast region and a nonboiling pressurized light-water-cooled thermal region. The advantage offered by this arrangement as compared with that using a solid moderator in the thermal zone is that, if a power excursion occurs, the water will increase the void content and tend to limit the excursion. The total reactor power is 216 Mwt, of which 163 Mwt is used to superheat steam as it passes through the fast regions of the reactor and 53 Mwt is transferred to the pressurized water. For this power split the fast core is 4 % subcritical without the reactivity contribution of the thermal region. A breeding ratio of 1. 4 is calculated for an oxide-fueled fast and thermal core and a high-density, metal-fueled radial blanket. The steam throttle conditions produced are 75 atm and 453 deg C for an average fast-core power density of 500 Mw/l. The original goal of 565 deg C throttle steam temperature and 1 Mw/l power density was compromised because of the surface temperature limitation of currently available cladding materials. The system {{does not require a}} large external power source for producing the steam introduced into the fast core. This is possible {{through the use of a}} steam compressor that increases the pressure of a portion of the superheated steam and thus permits its use to generate the required saturated-steam flow rate by vaporizing the feedwater from the steam cycle. The design includes a pressure-balance system that equalizes the static pressure in both the pressurized-water and steam systems. The pressure-balance system provides a means of cooling the steam regions in an emergency by allowing the pressurized water to flash. These features are intended to permit easier startup, operation, and shutdown of the en tire system. A summary of the reactor design characteristics is tabulated. (auth...|$|R
40|$|A novel fully passive small modular <b>superheated</b> water <b>reactor</b> (SWR) for {{underwater}} deployment {{is designed}} to produce 160 MWe with steam at 500 ºC to increase the thermodynamic efficiency compared with standard light water reactors. The SWR design {{is based on a}} conceptual 400 -MWe integral SWR using the internally and externally cooled annular fuel (IXAF). The coolant boils in the external channels throughout the core to approximately the same quality as a conventional boiling water reactor and then the steam, instead of exiting the reactor pressure vessel, turns around and flows downward in the central channel of some IXAF fuel rods within each assembly and then flows upward {{through the rest of the}} IXAF pins in the assembly and exits the reactor pressure vessel as superheated steam. In this study, new cladding material to withstand high temperature steam in addition to the fuel mechanical and safety behavior is investigated. The steam temperature was found to depend on the thermal and mechanical characteristics of the fuel. The SWR showed a very different transient behavior compared with a boiling water reactor. The inter-play between the inner and outer channels of the IXAF was mainly beneficial except in the case of sudden reactivity insertion transients where additional control consideration is required...|$|R
40|$|The {{conceptual}} design of an annular-fueled <b>superheat</b> boiling water <b>reactor</b> (ASBWR) is outlined. The proposed design, ASBWR, combines the boiler and superheater regions into one fuel assembly. This ensures good neutron moderation throughout the reactor core. A single fuel design {{is used in}} the core. Each annular fuel element, or fuel tube, is cooled externally by boiling water and internally by steam. Fuel pellets are made of low enrichment U 0 2, somewhat higher than the traditional BWR fuel enrichment. T 91 and Inconel 718 are selected as candidates for the cladding material in view of their excellent physical properties and corrosion resistance. The fuel-cladding gap is filled with pressurized helium gas, like the existing lighter water reactor fuels. The ASBWR fuel assembly contains sixty annular fuel elements and one square water rod (occupying a space of four fuel elements) in an 8 by 8 square array. Annular separators and steam dryers are utilized and located above the core in the reactor vessel. Reactor internal pumps are used to adjust the core flow rate. Cruciform control rods are used to control the reactivity of the core, but more of them may be needed than a traditional BWR in view of the harder spectrum. The major design constraints have been identified and evaluated in this work. The ASBWR is found promising to achieve a power density of 50 kW/L and meet all the main safety requirements. This includes a limit on the minimum critical heat flux ratio, maximum fuel and cladding operating temperatures, and appropriate stability margin against density wave oscillations. At the expected superheated steam of 520 °C, the plant efficiency is above 40 %, which is substantially greater than the efficiency of 33 to 35 % that today's generation of LWRs can achieve. In addition to generating electricity, the ASBWR may also be useful for liquid fuel production or other applications that require high temperature superheated steam. The uncertainties about this design include the performance of cladding materials under irradiation, the attainment of desirable heat transfer ratio between the external and internal coolant channels throughout the fuel cycle, and the response to the traditional transients prescribed as design basis events. by Yu-Chih Ko.
