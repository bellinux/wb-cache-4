25|$|The PRC's revised Criminal Law of 1997 {{retains its}} {{abolitionist}} focus {{in that it}} is primarily concerned with criminalising third-party involvement in prostitution. For the first time the death penalty may be used, but only in exceptional cases of organising prostitution activities, involving additional circumstances such as repeated offences, rape, causing <b>serious</b> <b>bodily</b> <b>injury,</b> etc. The activities of first-party participants continue to be regulated in practice according to administrative law, with the exceptions of anyone who sells or buys prostitutional sex in the full knowledge that they are infected with an STD; and anyone who has prostitutional sex with a child under 14 years of age. Since 2003, male homosexual prostitution has also been prosecuted under the law.|$|E
25|$|Use {{of deadly}} force is often granted to law {{enforcement}} officers when the person or persons in question {{are believed to be}} an immediate danger to people around them, or when a person poses a significant threat to a law enforcement officer, usually when the officer is at risk of <b>serious</b> <b>bodily</b> <b>injury</b> or death. Most law enforcement agencies establish a use of force continuum and list deadly force as a force of last resort. With this model, agencies try to control excessive use of force. Nonetheless, some question the number of killings by law enforcement officers, including killings of people who are unarmed, raising questions about widespread and ongoing excessive use of force. Other non-fatal incidents and arrests have raised similar concerns.|$|E

In Naidoo v Birchwood Hotel 2012 6 SA 170 (GSJ) the Court refused to uphold the exemption clauses {{based on the fact}} that it would have been unfair and unjust to the plaintiff who had sustained <b>serious</b> <b>bodily</b> <b>injuries</b> during his stay at the hotel.

50|$|The term BDSM is {{commonly}} used to describe consensual activities that contain sadistic and masochistic elements. Masochists {{tend to be very}} specific about the types of pain they enjoy, preferring some and disliking others. Many behaviors such as spanking, tickling, and love-bites contain elements of sado-masochism. Even if both parties legally consent to such acts this may not be accepted as a defense against criminal charges. Very few jurisdictions will permit consent as a legitimate defense if <b>serious</b> <b>bodily</b> <b>injuries</b> are caused. It has been argued that the law disregards the sexual nature of sadomasochism - or the fact that participants enter these relationships voluntarily because they enjoy the experience. Instead, the criminal justice system focuses on what it views as dangerous or violent behaviour. What this essentially means is that instead of attempting to understand and accommodate for voluntary sadomasochism, the law typically views these incidences as cases of assault. This can be seen with the well-known case in Britain, where 15 men were trialed for a range of offences relating to sadomasochism.|$|R
50|$|A spinal lock is a {{multiple}} joint lock {{applied to the}} spinal column, which is performed by forcing the spine beyond its normal ranges of motion. This is typically done by bending or twisting the head or upper body into abnormal positions. Commonly, spinal locks might strain the spinal musculature or result in a mild spinal sprain, while a forcefully and/or suddenly applied spinal lock may cause severe ligament damage or damage to the vertebrae, and possibly result in serious spinal cord injury, strokes, or death. Spinal locks and cervical locks are completely forbidden from Gi Jiu Jitsu, amateur MMA, multiple forms of No Gi Jiu Jitsu, Judo, and other martial arts. Due to its illegal nature and express purpose to cause <b>serious,</b> irrevocable <b>bodily</b> <b>injury,</b> paralysis, and death, its use {{both inside and outside}} of the gym can constitute aggravated assault.|$|R
2500|$|A presentence {{investigation}} report recommended that Jones receive a 25-year sentence {{because one of}} the victims had suffered [...] "serious bodily injury". Jones objected that this sentence was not authorized because the <b>serious</b> <b>bodily</b> <b>injury</b> component was not charged in the indictment. The district court overruled this objection, found that there had been <b>serious</b> <b>bodily</b> <b>injury</b> by a preponderance of the evidence, and imposed a 25-year sentence. [...] On appeal, the Ninth Circuit took the view that the enhanced provisions were merely sentencing factors that {{did not need to be}} set forth in the indictment or submitted to the jury. It therefore affirmed this aspect of Jones's conviction. The U.S. Supreme Court then agreed to review the case.|$|E
2500|$|In Almendarez-Torres v. United States, , Congress's nearly uniform {{history of}} {{treating}} recidivism as a sentencing factor led the Court {{to conclude that}} the aggravating fact therea prior conviction for certain crimeswas merely a sentencing factor exempt from the jury-trial requirement of the Sixth Amendment. [...] By contrast, Congress has made [...] "serious bodily injury" [...] an element of many crimes, such as assault {{by a member of the}} armed forces, violence at international airports, and genocide, [...] [...] Furthermore, carjacking is a species of robbery, and hence both Congress and state legislatures have traditionally treated <b>serious</b> <b>bodily</b> <b>injury</b> as an element of a more serious robbery crime.|$|E
2500|$|On June 1, 2007, the California Supreme Court {{rejected}} the Court of Appeal's decision and ruled that implied malice murder required proof that a defendant acted with [...] "conscious disregard" [...] {{of the danger}} to human life. [...] The Supreme Court held that the trial court's standard for implied malice murder (which required a high probabily of death) was too strict and the appellate court's standard (which required only <b>serious</b> <b>bodily</b> <b>injury</b> rather than a danger to human life) was too broad. The Supreme Court remanded {{the case to the}} trial court to reconsider whether to allow the second-degree murder conviction to stand in light of this new reasoning. The San Francisco Superior Court reinstated the conviction for second-degree murder, and on September 22, 2008, the court sentenced Knoller to 15 years to life.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{number of}} fatalities, <b>serious</b> <b>bodily</b> <b>injuries</b> and high {{potential}} injuries is unsatisfactory according to community standards; {{people are still}} being killed and seriously injured on mine sites due to human behaviour factors, such as not complying with rules, procedures and management failings. This research aims to conduct {{an analysis of the}} Australian Mining Industry safety performance and make comparisons with international mining operations, examine the mine safety environment and determine the effects that culture, risk management, prosecution policies, fly in fly out, fatigue and mental health are having on safety improvement. In this regard, as a major part of this research, a field survey has been conducted in the Qld and NSW coal mining industry. A total of 37 mines participated in manual and electronic surveys and responses were received from over 1200 questionnaires. A statistical comparison of the two surveys has been conducted using the Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test. This research has found that fatigue and awareness issues as well as travel times to work are having a major impact on safety at work, which is particularly evident when employees are working 12 hour shifts. The survey results show that {{there is a lack of}} experienced personnel in the industry and that the effective management of contractors continues to cause concern. This research has demonstrated that the current approach to prosecution is counter-productive, as it inhibits thorough safety investigation and creates a defensive rather than a no blame culture. It also prevents the sharing of safety information and heeding the lessons learned. It has been found that there is a lack of training in safety management systems, management influence effects the outcomes of risk assessments, accident investigation would be better without legal people’s involvement and an official inquiry would produce better outcomes if there was no fear of prosecution. This research has demonstrated that the safety performance in the Australian Mining Industry has not improved and may even be deteriorating and that in order to improve safety performance the mining industry needs to adopt the recommendations which have been made regarding culture, prosecution policies, training, risk assessments, shift lengths and fly in fly out operations...|$|R
40|$|The {{theme of}} the thesis is to {{investigate}} the current safety paradigm in the Australian coal mining industry and establish if the safety performance is improving. The number of fatalities, <b>serious</b> <b>bodily</b> <b>injuries</b> and high potential injuries is unsatisfactory according to community standards. People are still being killed {{and there is little}} evidence of a sustained improvement trend over the last decade. Lost time injuries have reduced dramatically, but are now plateauing and {{over the last few years}} along with high potential injuries and other safety indicators are trending upwards. This research has found that hundreds of serious injuries are not being reported which would have a significant effect on safety indicators in the Industry. Fatigue and awareness issues as well as travel times to work are having a major impact on safety at work, which is particularly evident when employees are working 12 -hour shifts. The rapid expansion of the mining industry has required the growing use of contractors, hence creating a more inexperienced workforce. Another significant finding is that there is a close association between the level of fatalities recorded and the growing use of contract labour in the industry. This research has demonstrated that the current approach to prosecution is counter productive, as it inhibits thorough safety investigation and creates a defensive rather than a proactive safety culture. This approach has resulted in unwillingness by companies to examine the root causes of accidents and incidents for the fear of being prosecuted. This research has shown there is a lack of trust between mining companies, the unions and the inspectorate. It has been stated that miners lives are at risk because of the shortage of Inspectors in Queensland and that the inspectorate was not meeting its compliance obligations. There is a "disconnect" between what mining companies aspire to achieve at the corporate level with their safety management systems and what is achieved at the coal face. The thesis has demonstrated that safety performance is deteriorating and in order to improve this situation recommendations have been made regarding prosecution, contractors, fatigue, safety and health management systems, hours of work, audits and remuneration for inspectors...|$|R
5000|$|It {{has been}} argued that the {{fundamental}} aim of this law was not to protect individual governmental officers, but to guard against the victimization of [...] "government and its functions." [...] However, the courts have found that sparse legislative history makes it equally plausible that the statute was designed to protect individual officers. The offense has a base offense level of 10, and the official victim enhancement does not apply because [...] "the base offense level incorporates the fact that the victim was a governmental officer performing official duties." [...] Enhancements do apply, however, if the offense involved physical contact; or if a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed and its use was threatened; or if the victim sustained <b>bodily</b> <b>injury.</b> Harsher penalties, under a separate guideline, apply to aggravated assault (i.e. a felonious assault that involved (A) a dangerous weapon with intent to cause <b>bodily</b> <b>injury</b> (i.e., not merely to frighten) with that weapon; (B) <b>serious</b> <b>bodily</b> injury; or (C) an intent to commit another felony.)
