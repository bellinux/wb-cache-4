40|$|Mandatory minimum quality <b>standards</b> <b>for</b> size, grade, or {{maturity}} are {{a controversial}} provision included in many U. S. {{fruit and vegetable}} marketing order programs. These mandatory rules, which apply to all producers of the regulated fruit or vegetable, prevent the sale of any product that does not meet minimum specified standards. California kiwifruit growers approved a federal marketing order in 1985 with a provision establishing minimum quality standards in grade, size, and maturity that were first used <b>for</b> <b>kiwifruit</b> during the 1987 - 88 marketing year. This paper examines the effects of minimum maturity standards (MMS) on the average price differentials between kiwifruit from California and from New Zealand. The analysis of terminal market data found evidence of a “lemon ” type problem for eight out of 20 cases for which data sets were available. Results {{are consistent with the}} proposition that minimum maturity standards corrected a lemon problem of asymmetric information on sweetness of California kiwifruit in the Boston, Los Angeles and Philadelphia terminal markets.

40|$|California kiwifruit is one {{of several}} {{commodities}} with a federal marketing order covering both conventional and organic products. Organic kiwifruit handlers were asked for their views on marketing issues <b>for</b> organic <b>kiwifruit</b> and how they differ from those <b>for</b> conventional <b>kiwifruit.</b> Organically produced <b>kiwifruit</b> accounted <b>for</b> 6. 1 % of total 2001 - 2002 California kiwifruit production. There are several differences between organic and conventional kiwifruit. The average size of organic kiwifruit is smaller than conventional kiwifruit; sales tend to occur later in the marketing year; there are more intermediaries (middlemen) in the marketing channel; and a larger proportion of organic product is packed in smaller shipping containers. The traditional price premium for organic product is decreasing as organic production increases, and it is not unusual <b>for</b> organically produced <b>kiwifruit</b> to be sold as conventional fruit in conventional marketing channels. Product appearance is becoming more important to consumers of organic fruit, who are now less willing to pay premium prices for cosmetically challenged product...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Flower {{development}} in kiwifruit (Actinidia spp.) is initiated {{in the first}} growing season, when undifferentiated primordia are established in latent shoot buds. These primordia can differentiate into flowers in the second growing season, after the winter dormancy period and upon accumulation of adequate winter chilling. Kiwifruit is an important horticultural crop, yet {{little is known about}} the molecular regulation of flower development. Results To study kiwifruit flower development, nine MADS-box genes were identified and functionally characterized. Protein sequence alignment, phenotypes obtained upon overexpression in Arabidopsis and expression patterns suggest that the identified genes are required for floral meristem and floral organ specification. Their role during budbreak and flower development was studied. A spontaneous kiwifruit mutant was utilized to correlate the extended expression domains of these flowering genes with abnormal floral development. Conclusions This study provides a description of flower {{development in}} kiwifruit at the molecular level. It has identified markers for flower development, and candidates <b>for</b> manipulation of <b>kiwifruit</b> growth, phase change and time of flowering. The expression in normal and aberrant flowers provided a model <b>for</b> <b>kiwifruit</b> flower development. </p...|$|R

40|$|Fenhexamid is a new-generation {{agrochemical}} extensively {{used nowadays}} to protect high valuable crops and fruits from fungus attacks. In this paper, {{the development of}} an indirect competitive immunoassay for the determination of fenhexamid residues in fruit samples is described. After optimisation of immunoreagent concentrations, the assay, based on monoclonal antibody FHo 4 # 27, showed high sensitivity, and selectivity, with a limit of detection <b>for</b> fenhexamid <b>standards</b> in buffer of 0. 04 μg/L. The influence of several physico-chemical factors, including pH, ionic strength, solvent tolerance, and matrix interferences on the analytical parameters of the standard curve was studied. For spiked liquid food samples like grape must, just a direct 1 : 50 dilution in water was sufficient to attain recoveries between 100 % and 110 %. <b>For</b> <b>kiwifruit</b> and strawberry samples, a double extraction procedure with methanol is proposed in this study, which afforded recovery values that ranged between 103 % and 116 %. The limit of quantification of the developed assay was 5 μg/kg for grape must, 10 μg/kg <b>for</b> <b>kiwifruits,</b> and 25 μg/kg for strawberries. The optimised assay was compared with a reference procedure based on liquid chromatography using incurred samples from the market, and an excellent correlation between both methods was found. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa) is a {{climacteric}} fruit {{sensitive to}} low concentrations of ethylene. To investigate the transcriptional mechanisms underlying kiwifruit ethylene response, transcription factors encoding four EIN 3 -Like (EILs) and 14 Ethylene Response Factors (ERFs) were cloned from kiwifruit. Expression of these transcription factors was examined during fruit development. The expression of transcripts of most AdERFs was higher during early fruit development, {{with the exception}} of AdERF 3, which increased with maturity. Several AdERFs were apparently down-regulated by ethylene, as they were affected by the ethylene inhibitor 1 -methylcyclopropene and by antisense suppression of ACO (for 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid oxidase) in the fruit. In contrast, AdEILs were constitutively expressed during fruit development and ripening. The transcription factors AdEIL 2 and AdEIL 3 activated transcription of the ripening-related genes AdACO 1 and AdXET 5 (xyloglucan endotransglycosylase gene) and, when overexpressed in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), stimulated ethylene production. The potential repressor AdERF 9 suppressed this promoter activity. These results support a role <b>for</b> <b>kiwifruit</b> EILs and ERFs in transcriptional regulation of ripening-related genes and in the regulation of kiwifruit fruit-ripening processes...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This study {{identifies}} the developmental processes contributing to variation in green-fleshed kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa (A. Chev.) C. F. Liang et A. R. Ferguson var. deliciosa) fruit {{dry matter content}} (DM) and fresh weight (FW) by comparing genotypes with either high or low final DM. Results are compared with the model for fruit development, the tomato (Solanum lycopersicumL.). Differences infinal compositionwere attributable to {{a higher rate of}} starch accumulation from 70 days after anthesis in high DM genotypes, with no other consistent differences in accumulation of soluble sugars or organic acids. High DM genotypes had 70 % higher starch content and differed from lowDM genotypes in the allocation of carbonbetween storage andother components. DMwasnegatively correlatedwithfinal fruit FWonly in highDMgenotypes, whereas starchwas a constant proportion of dryweight (DW), suggesting a dilution effect rather than an interaction between fruit size and carbohydratemetabolism. Comparedwith tomato, the organic acids, particularly quinic acid, contributedmore to estimated osmotic pressure during growth in FW than the soluble sugars, regardless of final composition or size. Seed mass per unit FW was highest in high DM genotypes, suggesting a previously unrecognised role <b>for</b> <b>kiwifruit</b> seeds i...|$|R
40|$|Farm and Orchard Management, in ARGOS, is studied from a {{management}} systems approach with three main areas of study; economic, social and the environment. Economics includes production (both financial and non-financial) through to socio economics of production systems. Social studies the ‘people’ {{implications of the}} systems, motivational drivers, life cycles, whilst the environment objective looks at the impact/implications of the farming system on the environment. Boundaries of the three objectives overlap, leading to overarching research that is a transdisciplinary study of farming systems. It was recognised that generic descriptors, of the farms under study, need to be supplied to the three objectives and {{this led to a}} fourth ‘sub’ objective, the farm/orchard management objective. The role of the management objective includes collecting physical and managerial style data and, where suitable, the preliminary analysis of this data. The main purpose of this synthesis report is to provide an overview of the type of management and production data that have been collected and key differences between production systems (also referred to as ‘panels’) within each sector. <b>For</b> <b>kiwifruit</b> and dairy, data up to the 2007 / 08 season is reported...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} a model, termed D-PSA-K, {{to estimate the}} accumulated potential damage on kiwifruit canes caused by bacterial canker during the growing and overwintering seasons. The model consisted of three parts including estimation {{of the amount of}} necrotic lesion in a non-frozen environment, the rate of necrosis increase in a freezing environment during the overwintering season, and the amount of necrotic lesion on kiwifruit canes caused by bacterial canker during the overwintering and growing seasons. We evaluated the model’s accuracy by comparing the observed maximum disease incidence on kiwifruit canes against the damage estimated using weather and disease data collected at Wando during 1994 – 1997 and at Seogwipo during 2014 – 2015. For the Hayward cultivar, D-PSA-K estimated the accumulated damage as approximately nine times the observed maximum disease incidence. For the Hort 16 A cultivar, the accumulated damage estimated by D-PSA-K was high when the observed disease incidence was high. D-PSA-K could assist kiwifruit growers in selecting optimal sites <b>for</b> <b>kiwifruit</b> cultivation and establishing improved production plans by predicting the loss in kiwifruit production due to bacterial canker, using past weather or future climate change data...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{wind and}} bees in kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa (A. Chev.) C. F. Liang et A. R. Ferguson) {{pollination}} was investigated using large cages enclosing 80 mature vines and assembled so as to prevent insects entering without reducing wind flow within the cages. Monitoring wind speed within the cage and in the open orchard showed that the cages were suitable for such experimentation. Cages without hives, cages with hives, open pollination with hives, and hand pollination were compared during 1990 and 1991. Wind pollination led to an appreciable fruit set (81 and 98 % {{in the first and}} second year respectively) but fruit weight was low, averaging 61 and 66 g. The use of hives resulted in 98 - 100 % fruit set, but fruit size did not improve significantly, remaining far below that achieved by hand pollination (66 g versus 108 g, the first year; 78 g versus 119 g, the second year). The short flowering period, the frequent adverse weather conditions, and the unpredictable foraging efficiency of bee colonies, made both wind and honey bees inadequate <b>for</b> <b>kiwifruit</b> pollination.

40|$|Researchers {{from various}} {{countries}} have proposed using dry matter at harvest as a worldwide quality index <b>for</b> Hay-ward <b>kiwifruit,</b> because it includes both soluble (sugars and acids) and insoluble (structural carbohydrates and starch) solids and doesn’t change during post-harvest handling. Our consumer tests in 1999 and 2008 indicated that dry matter and ripe titratable acidity {{are related to}} in-store consumer acceptance of kiwi-fruit. In most California seasons, when ripe titratable acidity was less than 1. 2 %, only a dry matter {{greater than or equal}} to 15. 1 % was required for consumer ac-ceptability. Our 6 -year quality attribute survey of California kiwifruit at harvest and from cold storage demonstrated that dry matter and ripe soluble solids concentration were highly variable among vineyards and seasons, but ripe titratable acidity values varied more among seasons than between vineyards. Our results provide strong evidence that dry matter would be a reliable quality index candidate <b>for</b> California <b>kiwifruit,</b> especially if ripe titratable acidity were factored in.
