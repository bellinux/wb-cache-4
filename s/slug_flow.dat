There are various regimes: Single phase water or air flow, Bubbly flow, Bubbly-slug flow, <b>Slug</b> <b>flow,</b> Slug-churn flow, Churn flow, Churn-annular flow, and Annular flow. The simplest and most common method {{used to identify}} the ﬂow regime is visual observation. This approach is, however, subjective and unsuitable for relatively high gas and liquid ﬂow rates. Therefore, the machine learning methods are proposed by many authors. The methods are applied to differential pressure data collected during a calibration process. The method of elastic maps provided a 2D map, where the area of each regime is represented.

A two-phase flow experiment was flown aboard the NASA KC- 135 zero gravity aircraft to test void fraction sensors and collect void fraction data under the unique conditions of microgravity. Void fraction measurements were made by two capacitance void fraction sensors and trapped liquid between two quick closing valves. A statistical method involving a probability density function and moments of a distribution were developed to analyze the void fraction fluctuations for uses as a possible flow regime identifier. Results show that <b>slug</b> <b>flows</b> exhibit both unimodal distribution and multi-modal distribution in the probability density function while annular flows have unimodal distribution with a peak at high void fractions. It was found that the variance of void fluctuations for <b>slug</b> <b>flows</b> tended to be larger than annular flows.

5000|$|Annular mist flow {{occurs at}} high gas velocities. A thin film of liquid is present around the annulus of the pipe. Typically {{most of the}} liquid is entrained {{in the form of}} {{droplets}} in the gas core. As a result of gravity, there is usually a thicker film of liquid {{on the bottom of the}} pipe as opposed to the top of the pipe. [...] Stratified (smooth) flow exists when the gravitational separation is complete. The liquid flows along the bottom of the pipe as gas flows over the top. Liquid holdup in this regime can be large but the gas velocities are low. [...] Stratified wave flow is similar to stratified smooth flow, but with a higher gas velocity. The higher gas velocity produces waves on the liquid surface. These waves may become large enough to break off liquid droplet at the peaks of the waves and become entrained in the gas. These droplets are distributed further down the pipe. [...] <b>Slug</b> <b>flow</b> is where large frothy waves of liquid form a slug that can fill the pipe completely. These slugs may also be in the form of a surge wave that exists upon a thick film of liquid on the bottom of the pipe.

To form stable <b>slug</b> <b>flow,</b> the throughput of order of μL min− 1 has been employed. To use <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> in industrial scale, however, controlled and high throughput mass transfer and an index for design of a channel with <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> are required. To address this requirement, we examined the influences of operating conditions such as the channel size and the flow rate on flow patterns and the mass transfer rate. Based on the experimental results, we derived an index to represent the mass transfer rate in <b>slug</b> <b>flow.</b> For further improvement of mass transfer in <b>slug</b> <b>flow,</b> we also verified that the channel including a sudden expansion improves the mass transfer efficiency...|$|E
40|$|In {{two-phase}} <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> pattern, {{the bulk}} of the gas is trapped inside large bubbles that are separated by liquid slugs, which may contain small dispersed bubbles. The unsteady nature of <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> makes the prediction of pressure drop and heat and mass transfer a difficult task. Earlier models that deal with steady <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> assume constant lengths and shapes of liquid slugs and elongated bubbles, as well as a constant elongated bubble propagation velocity. However, due to the intrinsically irregular character of <b>slug</b> <b>flow,</b> statistical means are required for its proper description. Variation of the flow parameters along the pipes of various diameters and inclinations may strongly affect the resulting flow pattern and should thus be taken into account in modeling the flow. The development of <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> along the pipe is mainly governed by the interaction between consecutive elongated bubbles. To gain a better insight into the mechanisms that govern <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> evolution along pipes, experiments with controlled injection of consecutive elongated bubbles were performed in recent years. Due to the complexity of both the continuous <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> and the liquid flow around injected bubbles, sophisticated experimental methods are required. The latest works regarding the hydrodynamic and statistics of naturally occurring continuous <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> in pipes, as well as the results of experiments with controlled injection of elongated bubbles are reviewed.

Severe <b>slugging</b> <b>flow</b> brings major threat to production and flow assurance in {{oil and gas industry}} due to periodical pressure oscillation and large liquid volume. Currently many researchers pay much more attention on L-shaped riser, catenaries, and S-shaped riser; little research has been made on hybrid riser, which is applied in the Africa West and Gulf of Mexico oil fields. Flow characteristics simulation for hybrid riser is made in this paper, using the one-dimensional and quasi-equilibrium model to simulate not only the riser-base pressure, severe slugging period, and the liquid slug length of the whole system but also base-pressure in the flexible pipe section.

Besides, the influence of flexible pipe to the severe slugging characteristics of hybrid riser system is analyzed, which are significant for the determination of riser structure...|$|R
40|$|The {{pressure}} drop of <b>slug</b> <b>flows</b> in capillary tubes is mostly {{resulted from the}} pressure gradient of liquid slugs in the capillary tubes, which {{can be related to}} the radius of the Taylorbubbles behind the liquid slugs. The paper proposes a theoretical relation between the pressure gradient in a liquid slug and the radius of the following Taylor bubble in capillary tubes. The present relation is derived by assuming that the flow taking place around a Taylor bubble is incompressible laminar flow. Verification of the present relation is done by comparing the results predicted from the present relation with the results from empirical formulas. The present relation showed not only that it could predict additional pressure gradients, resulted from the presence of the Taylor bubbles. It also agreed well with the empirical results, and also it gave more insights about <b>slug</b> <b>flows,</b> for instance, the critical bubble-to-tube radius ratio and the velocity profiles in liquid slugs...|$|R
40|$|Solids {{deposition}} in the horizontal pipeline of a pneumatic conveying system was studied both mathematically and experimentally.

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{influence}} of unsteady <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> on the dynamic response of flexible risers is analysed using a computational tool consisting of one program for prediction of <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> development, and another program for calculation of dynamic response of the riser. Both programs apply a time integration method, and since <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> leads to dynamic response of the riser, and riser dynamics influences <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> behaviour, the two codes exchange feedback of information during the integration process. Information exchange is established by building a computer federation of programs based on High Level Architecture (HLA). The federation is composed of two standalone in-house computer codes. The first one is a two-phase flow code which simulates unsteady <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> through pipes and risers using a Lagrangian tracking model. The second one is a program for static and dynamic global riser analysis based on a two dimensional nonlinear finite element formulation. Using the HLA rules, a communication interface was built, so the two programs are able to perform synchronized time integration with mutual feedback of information for each time step. The <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> – riser dynamics interaction is a complex problem. The riser response depends on the <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> behaviour, and the <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> development {{is influenced by the}} riser configuration. Displacement response of the riser and {{the influence of}} them on the <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> development have been studied for different flexible riser configurations carrying different liquid and gas flow rates. Results have shown the importance of using complete mathematical models for each phenomena and the importance of a strong interface of communication in order to predict a realistic behaviour of the <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> - riser dynamics interaction. Analysis on the influence of the <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> on the effective tension and bending moment of a flexible riser was studied showing increment of axial and bending stresses. Moreover, the simulations have demonstrated the importance to use a full non-linear finite element model for the riser dynamics, because the riser response influence strongly on the <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> behaviour. Finally, the numerical results were validated against experimental data showing a reasonable agreement...|$|E

The Probability Density Function, the Power Spectral Density of the time series of cross sectionally averaged void fractions and the cross-correlation of time series from adjacent probes have been obtained {{to determine the effect}} of the orifice on the flow characteristics. The diameter area ratio and the thickness of the orifice have a higher influence on bubbly than on <b>slug</b> and churn <b>flows.</b> The recovery length is about 20, 10 and 7 pipe diameter downstream the orifice for these three flow patterns respectively. Homogenization effect needs a minimum liquid superficial velocity. Its position occurs depends on the value of this velocity and on the orifice fractional open area.

40|$|Electrostatic charge {{generation}} in gas-solid fluidized beds {{is a significant}} industrial problem. Associated problems include particle agglomeration and particle wall fouling. In the polymerization industry this may result in "sheets" of fused polymer, due to exothermic reaction causing the melting of the polymer, which can fall off and block the distributor plate disrupting fluidizing gas flow. Additionally, blockage of the catalyst feed or the polymer removal system can take place or the product can become non-uniform. All of these problems require shut-down of the reactor which results in lost production time. While this phenomena has been identified for many years, the mechanisms involved are not well understood, especially wall fouling {{and the distribution of}} charge within the bed. Isolation of individual parameters such as hydrodynamics, operating conditions, and material involved is necessary to evaluate how each parameter impacts charge generation during fluidization. In this thesis, the fluidization system consisted of a stainless steel column, two online Faraday cups, and a retractable distributor plate. This system allowed for the simultaneous measurement of charge within different regions of the bed: the entrained fine particles, the particles adhered to the column wall, and the bulk of the bed. Additionally, mass and particle size distributions were measured and images of the layer of particles adhered to the column wall were taken for comparison. This allowed for a charge distribution comparison and evaluation of wall fouling. Three different parameters were investigated: duration of fluidization, column wall material, and relative humidity of fluidizing gas. Fluidization time was studied for 15, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 360 min; relative humidity was investigated for 0 %, 20 %, 40 %, 60 %, and 80 % relative humidity. Both fluidization time and relative humidity were evaluated at four different fluidization gas velocities, two each in the bubbling and <b>slugging</b> <b>flow</b> regimes. Column wall material was evaluated for a stainless steel and carbon steel column at two gas velocities, one each in the bubbling and <b>slugging</b> <b>flow</b> regimes. Fluidization time was found to influence wall fouling in the bubbling flow regime as the particle layer continued to build as fluidization progressed. In the <b>slugging</b> <b>flow</b> regime, the particle layer developed within 15 minutes of the onset of fluidization. The bubbling flow regime was shown to have a greater capacity for charge generation than the <b>slugging</b> <b>flow</b> regime. This was due to the vigorous mixing in the bubbling flow regime resulting in more particle-particle interactions. Column wall material was shown to influence wall fouling in the <b>slugging</b> <b>flow</b> regime due to the differences in surface roughness of the columns. This was due to the particle-wall contacts resulting in frictional charging which is the predominant charging mechanism in this flow regime. Charge was also impacted in the bubbling flow regime in those particles that were adhered to the column wall. Relative humidity was found to influence wall fouling at the lowest gas velocity tested. However, variations in generation of charge occurred at all fluidization gas velocities tested; the charge-to-mass ratios for the particles adhered to the column wall in the <b>slugging</b> <b>flow</b> regime decreased with high relative humidities. This was due to either the formation of a water film layer on the column wall or instantaneous surface water films on the particles throughout fluidization...|$|R

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> characteristics is very important when designing pipelines and process equipment. When the intermittences typical in <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> occurs, the fluctuations of the flow variables bring additional concern to the designer. Focusing on this subject the present work discloses the experimental data on <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> characteristics occurring in a large-size, large-scale facility.

40|$|The {{use of a}} gas–liquid <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> in a microreactor {{has several}} {{advantages}} such as a large surface area for contacting gas and liquid phases and circulation flow inside slugs. These advantages accelerate the mass transfer between the two phases, resulting in {{a high concentration of}} dissolved gas. The enhanced mass transfer is useful in carrying out liquid phase oxidation that uses oxygen gas as the oxidizing agent. The gas–liquid <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> in a microreactor system is applied to the oxidation of ethyl lactate using an oxy-vanadium species for producing ethyl pyruvate. The reactor system includes two T-shaped micromixers: one for mixing the substrate with a catalyst solution and the other for generating <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> by the addition of oxygen. The oxidation reaction proceeds right after the <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> is generated in the second mixer, because the substrate and the catalyst mix rapidly in the first micromixer. Moreover, a high concentration of dissolved oxygen due to improved mass transfer in <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> increases the oxidation reaction rate. Therefore, compared to a batch reaction, the synthesis using <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> provides high yields of ethyl pyruvate per unit time and achieves satisfactory productivity at the reaction temperature of 323 K, which is lower than that employed in conventional syntheses. The proposed system enables the production of ethyl pyruvate using a simple reactor setup with reduced energy consumption...|$|E

Use of non-boiling two phase flows {{in the form of}} segmented flows {{has become one of the}} interesting methods for achieving higher cooling (or mass transfer) capacities. Segmented flows (also known as <b>slug</b> <b>flows,</b> plug flows, or Taylor flows) is a series of moving liquid segments which are separated by gas bubbles or another liquid <b>slugs.</b> These <b>flows</b> are known as gas-liquid or liquid-liquid two phase flows, respectively. The effective phenomenon in {{heat transfer}} enhancement is internal circulations inside the liquid slugs, which helps to mix the liquid. The main focus of the present thesis is on heat transfer of gas-liquid segmented ows, using numerical simulations based on the concepts of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). As shown in the literature review, large gaps exist in research which need further studies. The target of this research is providing details on hydrodynamics and heat transfer in gas-liquid two phase flows, which can be helpful in understanding the whole process better. Based on the literature reviewed, the numerical modeling can be conducted using single phase or two phase simulations. Both single phase and two phase numerical simulations have been performed in this research. The research has also been conducted using fixed and moving frames of reference. It has been shown that <b>slug</b> <b>flows</b> with shorter <b>slugs</b> provide greater cooling ca- pacities compared with long slugs. Furthermore, it has been shown that liquid film around bubbles reduces the intensity of circulations in liquid slugs and hence reduces the cooling capacity. Therefore, using hydrophobic wall materials has been suggested.

The three-phase <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> pattern {{is characterized by a}} flow of decane droplets containing single elongated nitrogen bubbles, which are separated by water slugs. This flow pattern was observed at a superficial velocity of decane (in the range from about 0. 6 to 10 mm/s) typically lower than that of water for a given superficial gas velocity in the range of 30 to 91 mm/s. The parallel-slug flow pattern is characterized by a continuous water flow {{in one part of the}} channel cross section and a parallel flow of decane with dispersed nitrogen bubbles in the adjacent part of the channel cross section, which was observed at a superficial velocity of decane (in the range from about 2. 5 to 40 mm/s) typically higher than that of water for each given superficial gas velocity. Three-phase <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> can be seen as a superimposition of both decane-water and nitrogen-decane slug flows observed in the chip when the flow of the third phase (viz. nitrogen or water, respectively) was set at zero. Parallel-slug flow can be seen as a superimposition of the decane-water parallel flow and the nitrogen-decane <b>slug</b> <b>flow</b> observed in the chip under the corresponding two-phase flow conditions.

An experiment was operated onboard NASA aircraft capable of producing short periods of microgravity. In addition to high speed photographs of the flows, electronic measurements of void fraction, liquid film thickness, bubble and wave velocity, pressure drop and wall shear stress were made {{for a wide range of}} liquid and gas flow rates. The effects of liquid viscosity, surface tension and tube diameter on the behavior of these flows were also assessed. From the data collected, maps showing the occurrence of various flow patterns as a function of gas and liquid flow rates were constructed. Earth gravity two-phase flow models were compared to the results of the microgravity experiments and in some cases modified. Models were developed to predict the transitions on the flow pattern maps. Three <b>flow</b> patterns, bubble, <b>slug</b> and annular <b>flow,</b> were observed in microgravity. These patterns were found to occur in distinct regions of the gas-liquid flow rate parameter space. The effect of liquid viscosity, surface tension and tube diameter on the location of the boundaries of these regions was small. Void fraction and Weber number transition criteria both produced reasonable transition models. Void fraction and bubble velocity for bubble and <b>slug</b> <b>flows</b> were found to be well described by the Drift-Flux model used to describe such flows in earth gravity. Pressure drop modeling by the homogeneous flow model was inconclusive for bubble and <b>slug</b> <b>flows.</b> Annular flows were found to be complex systems of ring-like waves and a substrate film. Pressure drop was best fitted with the Lockhart- Martinelli model. Force balances suggest that droplet entrainment may be a large component of the total pressure drop...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{mechanisms}} leading to enhanced heat and/or mass transfer rates in two-phase non-boiling <b>slug</b> <b>flows.</b> The problem is analyzed in a minichannel geometry {{subjected to a}} constant heat flux boundary. Local Nusselt numbers, obtained using Infrared thermography are analyzed in both entrance and fully developed flow regions. These novel measurements highlight the physics governing slug-flow heat transfer and results indicate that optimized slug geometries can yield up to {{an order of magnitude}} heat transfer enhancement. Finally, based on the physics identified, a heat transfer model is developed which is also applicable to similar mass transfer problems. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
