5000|$|Fascinated by the {{creation}} of the Gadget, Gian and Suneo unknowingly passed through the <b>shrinking</b> <b>tunnel,</b> resulting in shrinking to small size while Nobita, Doraemon and Shizuka get lost into the tunnel leading them to [...] "Natural Man Made Solar Sun" [...] from which the whole museum works. Due to Dr. Pepura Hasake (which is been shown the reason why he secretly lives inside the secret room along with his grand daughter Ginger) negligence, causing a freak accident which result to the solar sun going mad and endangering the world leading him to get dismissed from his post and leaving the museum. However, due to this incident, Dr. Harutoman (Kurt's grandfather) discovered the metal named as [...] "Fullmetal" [...] which enable him to stabilize the core of the sun and made him famous.|$|E
50|$|Some heat <b>shrink</b> <b>tunnels</b> {{have two}} or more zones for heating and {{controlled}} cooling.|$|R
50|$|Shrink wrap {{is applied}} over {{or around the}} {{intended}} item, often by automated equipment. It is then heated by a heat gun or sent through a <b>shrink</b> <b>tunnel</b> or oven for shrinking.|$|R
50|$|A <b>shrink</b> <b>tunnel</b> or heat tunnel is {{a heated}} tunnel mounted over or around a {{conveyor}} system. Items (such as packaging) have shrink film loosely applied; with heat, the film shrinks to fit snugly around the wrapped object.|$|R
50|$|PLA {{can also}} be used as a decomposable {{packaging}} material, either cast, injection-molded, or spun. Cups and bags have been made from this material. In the form of a film, it shrinks upon heating, allowing it to be used in <b>shrink</b> <b>tunnels.</b> It is useful for producing loose-fill packaging, compost bags, food packaging, and disposable tableware. In the form of fibers and nonwoven fabrics, PLA also has many potential uses, for example as upholstery, disposable garments, awnings, feminine hygiene products, and diapers.|$|R
5000|$|Tunnels are {{available}} {{with or without a}} conveyor system. Some are built into a production line or are integral with machinery that also applies the shrink film. Others are movable by hand or by castors. A <b>shrink</b> <b>tunnel,</b> referred to as an oven, may be equipped with an integrated conveyor of two different kinds: the roller conveyor or the belt conveyor. Roller conveyors can be used with polyolefin, PVC, and shrink polyethylene films. The space in between the rollers is filled with hot air {{from the bottom of the}} <b>tunnel</b> to <b>shrink</b> the film layer around the object, creating a sealed package. When used with polyolefin and PVC based films the rollers are called [...] "live" [...] or spinning. When used with polyethylene films the rollers are called [...] "dead" [...] or not spinning. The tunnels with Teflon mesh belts and polymer mesh belts are used for smaller packages, or when the package may have an instability and need a stable platform.|$|R
