Unpowered gliders are lighter and, {{as they do}} not need a <b>safety</b> <b>margin</b> for {{starting}} the engine, they can safely thermal at lower altitudes in weaker conditions. Consequently, pilots in unpowered gliders may complete competition flights when some powered competitors cannot. Conversely, motor glider pilots can start the engine if conditions will no longer support soaring flight, while unpowered gliders will have to land out, away from the home airfield, requiring retrieval by road using the glider's trailer.|$|E

In order to minimize the overhead of <b>safety</b> <b>margins,</b> there is an increasing interest for adaptive techniques.

This thesis work is a case study of implementation and evaluation of the Razor approach on a processor which executes a subset of the AVR 32 instruction set. ATMEL 150 nm low leakage library is used for synthesize and evaluations. A methodology is explained to introduce the Razor approach to the pipeline with one-cycle error recovery.

We also provide estimates of <b>safety</b> <b>margins</b> by using a complementary approach based on stochastic simulations of a macroeconomic model. The findings are qualitatively very similar to those obtained with the other method. Moreover, we lend empirical support to the view that a fiscal structure with lower budget sensitivity to cyclical fluctuations is conducive to less ambitious <b>safety</b> <b>margins.</b> ...|$|R

25|$|The {{dielectric}} {{layer thickness}} {{generated by the}} forming voltage is directly proportional to the voltage proof of electrolytic capacitors.

25|$|A {{system with}} an {{intermediate}} quality factor (Qnbsp&=nbsp&) {{is said to}} be critically damped. Like an overdamped system, the output does not oscillate, and does not overshoot its steady-state output (i.e., it approaches a steady-state asymptote). Like an underdamped response, the output of such a system responds quickly to a unit step input. Critical damping results in the fastest response (approach to the final value) possible without overshoot. Real system specifications usually allow some overshoot for a faster initial response or require a slower initial response to provide a <b>safety</b> <b>margin</b> against overshoot.|$|E

25|$|Avermectins {{belong to}} the family of macrocyclic lactones and are the major drugs used as in-feed {{treatments}} to kill sea lice. The first avermectin used was ivermectin at doses close to the therapeutic level and was not submitted for legal approval for use on fish by its manufacturer. Ivermectin was toxic to some fish, causing sedation and central nervous system depression due to the drug’s ability to cross the blood–brain barrier. Emamectin benzoate, which is the active agent in the formulation SLICE, has been used since 1999 and has a greater <b>safety</b> <b>margin</b> on fish. It is administered at 50µg/kg/day for 7 days and is effective for two months, killing both chalimus and mobile stages. Withdrawal times vary with jurisdiction from 68 days in Canada to 175 degree days in Norway. Avermectins act by opening glutamate-gated chloride channels in arthropod neuromuscular tissues, causing hyperpolarization and flaccid paralysis leading to death. Resistance has been noted in Chalimus rogercresseyi in Chile and L. salmonis on North Atlantic fish farms. The resistance is likely due to prolonged use of the drug leading to up-regulation of P-glycoprotein, similar to what has been seen in nematode resistance to macrocyclic lactones.|$|E
500|$|The demon core was a [...] {{subcritical}} mass {{of plutonium}} measuring [...] in diameter, which {{was involved in}} two criticality accidents. The core was slated {{for use in a}} third World War II nuclear bomb, but remained in use for testing after Japan's surrender. It was designed with a small <b>safety</b> <b>margin</b> to ensure a successful explosion of the bomb. The device briefly went supercritical when it was accidentally placed in supercritical configurations during two separate experiments intended to guarantee the core was indeed close to the critical point. The incidents happened at the Los Alamos laboratory in 1945 and 1946, and resulted in the acute radiation poisoning and subsequent deaths of scientists Harry Daghlian and Louis Slotin. After these incidents the spherical plutonium core was referred to as the [...] "demon core".|$|E

In this state there is only a small <b>safety</b> <b>margin</b> against extraneous factors that might increase criticality, causing the core to become supercritical, and then prompt critical, a brief state of rapid power increase. [...] These factors are not common in the environment; they are circumstances like the compression of the solid metallic core – which would eventually be the method used to explode the bomb, the addition of more nuclear material or provision of an external reflector which would reflect outbound neutrons back into the core. The experiments conducted at Los Alamos leading to the two fatal accidents were designed to guarantee that the core was indeed close to the critical point by arranging such reflectors and seeing how much neutron reflection was required to approach supercriticality.|$|E

40|$|Haptic {{steering}} guidance is {{an advanced}} driving assistance system which provides guidance torques {{on the steering}} wheel to assist a human driver. Improvements in performance, <b>safety</b> <b>margins</b> and workload have been reported for lane-keeping and curve negotiation tasks. On the other hand, the guidance system instigates increased driver torques, indicating the occurrence of a mismatch between driver and automation intention. A novel, criticality-based control structure was developed, capable of adapting to different driving conditions by using <b>safety</b> <b>margins</b> (operationalized as time-to-line crossing, TLC) as input. Twenty-four participants drove through a single-lane, 10. 8 km long road, with as independent variables the road width (normal road width of 3 m, wide road width of 5 m) and the type of guidance received: no guidance (manual), haptic steering guidance based on lateral deviation from the center-line (performance-based guidance, PBG) and criticality-based guidance (CBG). On the normal road, results show similar benefits for both guidance systems compared to manual control, in terms of performance and <b>safety</b> <b>margins.</b> Workload was reduced by PBG, but both guidance systems yielded increased driver torques. On the wide road, participants drove closer to the center-line with PBG, but at the cost of significantly more guidance torques than CBG. Interestingly, this reduction in lateral deviation did not result in a significant improvement for lowest <b>safety</b> <b>margins</b> encountered. No subjective preference was found for either feedback condition. It can be concluded that criticality-based guidance is capable of adjusting to different driving conditions, without compromising <b>safety</b> <b>margins,</b> whilst greatly reducing guidance torques in situations where they are unneeded. <br/...|$|R

In consequence, calculating <b>safety</b> <b>margins</b> based on AUC represents the more conservative approach compared to <b>safety</b> <b>margins</b> calculated with Cmax.|$|R
40|$|The {{life cycle}} of complex {{products}} is subject to multiple uncertainties. Designers include margins into the product to cater for these uncertainties: <b>safety</b> <b>margins,</b> which is typically included in the requirements against the uncertainties of use and design margins against the uncertainties of design, such as changing requirements or engineering change. In practise the terms design <b>margins</b> and <b>safety</b> <b>margins</b> are sometimes used interchangeably. At {{the end of the}} design process, a product might include considerable overdesign, which can increase the initial cost as well as the running cost of many complex systems. Late discovery of both overdesign and lack of <b>safety</b> <b>margins</b> are also expensive to deal with in late phases. This paper explore the role of <b>safety</b> <b>margins</b> and design margins in the design process based on two case studies in truck design and jet engine component design. The paper shows that margins are added both to the requirements and the design parameters, so that companies run the risk of duplicating margins throughout the process without different teams being aware of it. This paper argues that a clearer and common description of design margins can reduce undesired iteration in development processes arising from misconceptions and aggregation effects in the development of complex systems...|$|R
