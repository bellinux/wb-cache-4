5|$|Ganymede's surface has an albedo {{of about}} 43%. Water ice {{seems to be}} {{ubiquitous}} on its surface, with a mass fraction of 50–90 %, significantly more than in Ganymede as a whole. Near-infrared spectroscopy has revealed the presence of strong water ice absorption bands at wavelengths of 1.04, 1.25, 1.5, 2.0 and 3.0 μm. The grooved terrain is brighter and has a more icy composition than the dark terrain. The analysis of high-resolution, near-infrared and UV spectra obtained by the Galileo spacecraft and from Earth observations has revealed various non-water materials: carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and, possibly, cyanogen, hydrogen sulfate and various organic compounds. Galileo results have also shown magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) and, possibly, <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> (Na2SO4) on Ganymede's surface. These salts may originate from the subsurface ocean.|$|E
25|$|Anhydrous <b>sodium</b> <b>sulfate</b> {{occurs in}} arid environments as the mineral thenardite.

40|$|<b>Sodium</b> cetearyl <b>sulfate</b> is the <b>sodium</b> salt of {{a mixture}} of cetyl and stearyl sulfate. The other {{ingredients}} in this safety assessment are also alkyl salts, including ammonium coco-sulfate, ammonium myristyl <b>sulfate,</b> magnesium coco-sulfate, <b>sodium</b> cetyl <b>sulfate,</b> <b>sodium</b> coco/hydrogenated tallow <b>sulfate,</b> <b>sodium</b> coco-sulfate, <b>sodium</b> decyl <b>sulfate,</b> <b>sodium</b> ethylhexyl <b>sulfate,</b> <b>sodium</b> myristyl <b>sulfate,</b> <b>sodium</b> oleyl <b>sulfate,</b> <b>sodium</b> stearyl <b>sulfate,</b> <b>sodium</b> tallow <b>sulfate,</b> <b>sodium</b> tridecyl <b>sulfate,</b> and zinc coco-sulfate.

50|$|Premarin {{consists}} of conjugated equine estrogens (CEEs), or, more exactly, the sodium salts of the sulfate esters of equine estrogens. The exact composition of Premarin is as follows: <b>sodium</b> estrone <b>sulfate</b> (49.3%), <b>sodium</b> equilin <b>sulfate</b> (22.4%), <b>sodium</b> 17α-dihydroequilin <b>sulfate</b> (13.8%), <b>sodium</b> 17α-estradiol <b>sulfate</b> (4.5%), <b>sodium</b> 8,9-dehydroestrone <b>sulfate</b> (3.5%), <b>sodium</b> equilenin <b>sulfate</b> (2.2%), <b>sodium</b> 17β-dihydroequilin <b>sulfate</b> (1.7%), <b>sodium</b> 17α-dihydroequilenin <b>sulfate</b> (1.2%), <b>sodium</b> 17β-estradiol <b>sulfate</b> (0.9%), <b>sodium</b> 17β-dihydroequilenin <b>sulfate</b> (0.5%), and <b>sodium</b> 8,9-dehydroestradiol <b>sulfate</b> (small amounts), {{as well as}} hippulin (also small amounts). There are many different steroids in Premarin, even androgens and progestogens, but only the above-mentioned estrogens are present in sufficient amounts to produce clinically-relevant effects.|$|R
50|$|EEs consist {{primarily}} of <b>sodium</b> estrone <b>sulfate</b> and <b>sodium</b> equilin <b>sulfate,</b> {{and are very}} similar to conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) preparations such as Premarin. However, EEs and CEEs differ in the sources of their contents and in the percentages of their constituents; CEEs consist of approximately 53% <b>sodium</b> estrone <b>sulfate</b> and 25% <b>sodium</b> equilin <b>sulfate,</b> while EEs contain approximately 80% <b>sodium</b> estrone <b>sulfate</b> and 11% <b>sodium</b> equilin <b>sulfate.</b> EEs and CEEs have been found to produce similar serum levels of estrone and estradiol. One study found that the risk of venous thrombosis may be less with EEs relative to CEEs.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Sodium</b> laureth <b>sulfate,</b> or <b>sodium</b> lauryl ether <b>sulfate</b> (SLES), is a {{detergent}} and surfactant {{found in}} many personal care products (soaps, shampoos, toothpastes, etc.).

40|$|The {{long-term}} capacity-time {{dependence of}} the systems decanol, <b>sodium</b> decyl <b>sulfate,</b> <b>sodium</b> dodecyl <b>sulfate</b> and <b>sodium</b> dodecane sulfonate were measured at the mercury / electrolyte interface in the temperature range from 20 °C to 50 °C at the potential of maximal adsorption. All surfactants used were of surface-chemical purity. The capacity-time dependences exhibited a slow increase of the capacity. The corresponding long-term time dependence could be well described theoretically with a first-order surface reaction in which surface micelles are formed from a complete adsorption layer. For decanol the initial state {{was assumed to be}} a monolayer of perpendicularly adsorbed molecules, for <b>sodium</b> decyl <b>sulfate,</b> <b>sodium</b> dodecyl <b>sulfate</b> and <b>sodium</b> dodecane sulfonate to be an "interdigitated" adsorption layer. The ratio of final equilibrium capacity to initial minimal capacity could be explained by the formation of hemispherical surface micelles in the case of decanol, <b>sodium</b> decyl <b>sulfate</b> and <b>sodium</b> dodecyl <b>sulfate</b> and by the formation of hemicylindrical surface micelles in the case of sodium dodecane sulfonate. A generalized packing parameter was introduced which involves the increase of the effective surface area of the head-groups due to penetration of the electrolyte ions into the head-groups layer. In {{the second part of the}} dissertation the concentration {{dependence of the}} surface tension at the interface air / water was investigated for the following surfactants of surface-chemical purity: dimethyldecylphosphine oxide, <b>sodium</b> decyl <b>sulfate,</b> <b>sodium</b> dodecyl <b>sulfate</b> and <b>sodium</b> dodecane sulfonate. The corresponding degree of coverage-concentration isotherms could be theoretically well described by the Frumkin model. The following relevant adsorption parameters were obtained: adsorption energy and lateral interaction energy as well as the surface area per adsorbed molecule. These parameters will be involved into the first database of surfactants of surface-chemical purity...|$|R
