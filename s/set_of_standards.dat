For example, the Society of Automotive Engineers has a series of grades defining many types of steel. The American Society for Testing and Materials has a separate <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>standards,</b> which define alloys such as A36 steel, {{the most commonly used}} structural steel in the United States. The JIS also define series of steel grades that are being used extensively in Japan as well as in third world countries.|$|E
5|$|USB {{implements}} {{connections to}} storage devices using a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>standards</b> called the USB mass storage device class (MSC or UMS). This {{was at first}} intended for traditional magnetic and optical drives and has been extended to support flash drives. It has also been extended to support {{a wide variety of}} novel devices as many systems can be controlled with the familiar metaphor of file manipulation within directories. The process of making a novel device look like a familiar device is also known as extension. The ability to boot a write-locked SD card with a USB adapter is particularly advantageous for maintaining the integrity and non-corruptible, pristine state of the booting medium.|$|E
5|$|Turkey is {{a charter}} {{member of the}} UN, an early member of NATO, the IMF and the World Bank, and a {{founding}} member of the OECD, OSCE, BSEC, OIC and G-20. After becoming one of the first members of the Council of Europe in 1949, Turkey became an associate member of the EEC in 1963, joined the EU Customs Union in 1995 and started accession negotiations with the European Union in 2005. Turkey's economy and diplomatic initiatives led to its recognition as a regional power while its location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history. Turkey's current administration headed by president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has reversed many of the country's earlier reforms which had been in place since the founding of the modern republic of Turkey, such as Freedom of the Press, and a Legislative System of Checks and Balances. A <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>standards</b> for secularism in government, as first enacted by Atatürk have also diminished in favour of conservative religionist governance, to the grievance of much of the Turkish public.|$|E
40|$|Let be a {{commutative}} ring, and [...] two -linear categories with {{an action}} {{of a group}} G. We introduce the notion <b>of</b> a <b>standard</b> G-equivalence from to.

25|$|However, Mayer {{has written}} that it was {{precisely}} unions' opposition to NAFTA overall that jeopardized organized labor's ability to influence the debate on labor standards in a significant way. During Clinton's presidential campaign, labor unions wanted NAFTA to include a side deal to provide {{for a kind of}} international social charter, a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>standards</b> that would be enforceable both in domestic courts and through international institutions. Mickey Kantor, then U.S. trade representative, had strong ties to organized labor and believed that he could get unions to come along with the agreement, particularly if they were given a strong voice in the negotiation process.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the native computer software, there are online JavaScript IDEs, debugging aids that are themselves written in JavaScript and built to run on the Web. An example is the program JSLint, developed by Douglas Crockford {{who has written extensively}} on the language. JSLint scans JavaScript code for conformance to a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>standards</b> and guidelines. Many libraries for JavaScript, such as three.js, provide links to demonstration code that can be edited by users. They are also used as a pedagogical tool by institutions such as Khan Academy to allow students to experience writing code in an environment where they can see the output of their programs, without needing any setup beyond a Web browser.|$|E

The renovated Tate Student Center became the sixth building on a university campus in the state of Georgia to be certified at the gold level and the second to be so designated in Athens. Following Tate's certification, Building 1516, a University housing complex constructed in 2010, is seeking Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification. The certification would mark the first LEED certified housing complex at the University of Georgia. The LEED Green Building Rating System provides a <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>standards</b> for environmentally sustainable construction and maintenance. Features of the building include; locations on each floor for students to recycle materials, increased levels of fresh air in the building, Energy Star qualified products, bioretention systems located near the building to filter pollutants from and treat stormwater runoff, a rainwater catchment system for water recycling among other installments.|$|E

25|$|On October 25, 1951, ODM even {{ordered a}} halt to the mass {{production}} of color television sets by CBS. CBS had developed a color system which was partly mechanical and partly electronic in nature. RCA had already developed a purely electronic color television system, and was engaged in a long and bitter legal battle with CBS before the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) over which system would be adopted. Although ODM had determined that research on color TV occupied the time of critically needed scientists and technicians, the research also had defense applications and could therefore proceed. However, production of the CBS color TV sets was not essential, and was banned. The ban on mass production of the CBS color television set led the FCC to choose the RCA system by default in 1953. That system was used in the US until June 12, 2009, when it was succeeded by the ATSC <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>standards.</b>|$|E
