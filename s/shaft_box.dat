40|$|This study {{focus on}} <b>shaft</b> <b>box</b> facade, special form of box window construction. It {{consists}} {{of a system of}} box window with continuous vertical shafts that extend over a number of stories to create a stack effect. The subject building was decided by analyzing various types of exiting apartments. <b>Shaft</b> <b>box</b> type balcony was devised by setting up shaft space at a part of balcony. Air flow and indoor air temperature were simulated, performance of <b>shaft</b> <b>box</b> type balcony was compared with existing types using VE computer simulation program. Research consequence can be summarized as follow: 1) In the case of existing types, the change of window opening rate has only a little effect on the improvement of indoor temperature. But, air flow rate increased two times in the case that changed opening rate 20 % to 40 % 2) In the case of existing types, the growth of air flow rate has little effect on the improvement of indoor temperature. But, <b>shaft</b> <b>box</b> type represented the remarkable effect on the improvement of indoor temperature as well as the growth of air flow rate...|$|E
40|$|As {{climate change}} and global warming have become {{two of the most}} {{significant}} environmental issues today, the double-skin façade (DSF) is getting considerable attention as an energy-efficient passive design. This study is aimed at assessing the seasonal energy efficiency strategies of a DSF targeting library facilities in the climate region with hot summers and cold winters. Toward this end, this study was conducted in four steps: (i) establishment of seasonal energy-efficient strategies; (ii) application of seasonal energy-efficient strategies; (iii) analysis of energy saving effect by season; and (iv) life cycle cost and life cycle CO 2 analyses for selecting an optimal DSF. Results show that a <b>shaft</b> <b>box</b> DSF energy model (EMS) # 2, which applied winter strategies, was optimal with an energy saving rate of 4. 13 %, while a multi-story DSF energy model (EMM) # 5, which applied summer strategies, was optimal with an energy saving rate of 12. 67 %. In terms of savings to investment ratio (SIR 40) and breakeven point (BEP 40), the multi-story DSF (3. 20; 9 years) was superior. The results of this study can be used for (i) seasonal energy efficiency strategies of a DSF in East Asian monsoon climates, and (ii) as a guideline for the application of a DSF both in existing and new buildings...|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  48, {{the effect of}} the water cooler after {{optimization}} on the temperature rise of the ranging arm is significant. Without the water cooler, the acceleration speed of temperature increase is very large. Figure  49 shows the distribution of the ranging arm temperature field without the water cooler under working conditions. Without the water cooler, the temperature gradient generated between transmission <b>shaft</b> and <b>box</b> is very large. It indicates that the water cooler of ranging arm design has solved the overheating problem with the 750  kW ranging arm. In addition, it provides a reference for the study on the heat balance of large power ranging arms, and the optimization of cooler design.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Vibration {{and noise}} {{problems}} of the gear system have been widely concerned in recent years. A study of transmission error is conducted to verify {{the sources of the}} vibration and noise. The tooth meshing process is analyzed with consideration of the <b>shaft,</b> bearing, <b>box,</b> tooth deformation, and tooth micro-modification in this paper. The transmission error of a two-stage gearbox is discussed based on a theoretical calculation model of gear transmission error. Then the transmission error is measured in different conditions on a test system of two-stage gearbox. By comparing to the test data, the theoretical model of the two-stage transmission error has been refined and a more reasonable model is presented. The study {{plays an important role in}} reducing vibration and noise of the gear system...|$|R

Windturbine {{braking systems}} improved by system {{consisting of two}} large steel-alloy disks mounted on high-speed <b>shaft</b> of gear <b>box,</b> and brakepad assembly mounted on bracket fastened to top of gear box. Lever arms (with brake pads) actuated by spring-powered, pneumatic cylinders connected to these arms. Springs give specific spring-loading constant and exert predetermined load onto brake pads through lever arms. Pneumatic cylinders actuated positively to compress springs and disengage brake pads from disks.

40|$|PID control; fuzzy control. Abstract. The paper {{presents}} {{concept and}} application of mathematical and simulation model of variable-speed drives (hereafter VSD or VSDs). The models were/are used in rolling mills engineering, commissioning and maintenance. The VSDs are the main actuators there. In order to reach optimal performance in terms of material tolerances, wear and tear, and reliability {{it is necessary to}} have good VSD control which meets not only technology targets but also properties of the VSD mechanical train (set of motor rotors, <b>shafts,</b> gear <b>boxes,</b> couplings, clutches, spindles, working and backup rolls, etc.). Only the optimal VSD control and appropriate operation and maintenance can ensure trouble-free operation and long lifetime of the VSDs. We have been dealing with the VSDs models since 1990. Since then we have used the models in many practical applications. Currently, we concentrate mainly on an optimal and advanced interstand section control. Apart from various PID control strategies, also Fuzzy control has been tested and analyzed. The paper mentions some of our experiences we have achieved in this area...|$|R
40|$|The {{excellent}} {{performance of}} a ship is assured by the accurate evaluation of its construction quality. For a long time, research into the construction quality of ships has mainly focused on qualitative analysis due to a shortage of process data, which results from limited samples, varied process types and non-standardized processes. Aiming at predicting and controlling {{the influence of the}} construction process on the construction quality of ships, this article proposes a reliability quantitative analysis flow path for the ship construction process and fuzzy calculation method. Based on the process-quality factor model proposed by the Function-Oriented Quality Control (FOQC) method, we combine fuzzy mathematics with the expert grading method to deduce formulations calculating the fuzzy process reliability of the ordinal connection model, series connection model and mixed connection model. The quantitative analysis method is applied in analyzing the process reliability of a ship's <b>shaft</b> gear <b>box</b> installation, which proves the applicability and effectiveness of the method. The analysis results can be a useful reference for setting key quality inspection points and optimizing key processes...|$|R
5000|$|The final pre-war {{model was}} the 1938 Minx. There {{were no more}} factory-built tourers but some were made by Carbodies. The car was {{visually}} similar to the Magnificent, with a different grille, {{and access to the}} luggage boot (trunk) was external (that on the predecessor was accessed by folding down the rear seat). There were two saloon models in the range, the basic [...] "Safety" [...] model with simple rexine trim instead of leather, no opening front quarterlights, and less luxurious trim levels. The De Luxe model had leather trim, opening quarterlights, extra trim pads, and various other comfort benefits. The 1938 model was not the final iteration before the outbreak of war, however, as the 1939 model was considerably different mechanically, with virtually the entire drivetrain improved to the extent that few parts are interchangeable with the 1938 model. This includes gearbox, differential, half <b>shafts,</b> steering <b>box,</b> and a great many other mechanical and cosmetic changes. Even the front grille, which to the casual eye looks almost identical to the 1938 model, became a pressed alloy component rather than a composite.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the dynamic {{response}} of rotors made of anisotropic, laminated composite materials. It is a sequel to the authors' previous work, which was devoted to the rotordynamics of metallic structures. The used variable kinematic one-dimensional models describe any cross-sectional deformation of the rotor and go beyond the plane strain assumptions of classical Euler-Bernoulli and Timoskenko beam theories. Refined theories are obtained by applying the Carrera unified formulation, which is extended here to the rotordynamics of multilayered composites. The displacement variables over the rotor cross section x-z plane are approximated by x, z polynomials of any order N. Thin-walled cylindrical <b>shafts</b> and <b>boxes</b> are analyzed. These structures are made of unidirectional layers, whose fiber orientation can vary {{with respect to the}} rotor-axis {{as well as in the}} x-z plane. Several analyses have been carried out to determine the vibrational response as a function of the rotating speed. Classical beam theories are obtained as particular cases and results available in the literature, including shell results, are used to assess the presented theory. The proposed refined models are very effective in investigating the dynamic behavior of laminated composite rotor...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} {{for the application of}} a magnetic gear (MG) box to a contra- rotating tidal turbine. The contra-rotating tidal turbine is a novel design comprising two sets of rotors placed axially: the upstream rotor rotates in a clockwise direction whilst the downstream rotor rotates in an anti-clockwise direction. The tidal turbine is a low speed mechanical system similar to a wind turbine, hence the use of a gearbox is considered to permit a standard 4 or 6 pole induction generator to be used. The magnetic gearbox magnetically combines the output of both contra-rotating shafts into a single high speed rotating <b>shaft.</b> A gear <b>box</b> has been designed using 3 D Finite Element Analysis and experimentally tested...|$|R

Owing to the restricted area of the tunnels and galleries, the work of excavation was almost exclusively that denominated heading, without the advantage of enlargement. The rock, after being blasted, was lifted by hand into a box resting on a truck-car, which was run down to a point upon a rail-track, and thence drawn by a mule to the <b>shaft,</b> where the <b>box</b> was hoisted by a derrick, and its contents emptied into dump-cars, to be rolled away, and deposited in the pile.

5000|$|After the Second World War, {{the company}} sought to capture what it {{saw as a}} {{developing}} need for personal transport and created the LE model [...] (for [...] "Little Engine").

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the failure {{analysis}} and redesign of shaft of overhead crane having capacity 25 tonne. There is problem of failure of the <b>shaft</b> in gear <b>box</b> which is mounted on the crane. The shaft breakage occurred due to dynamic, alternating low tensile– compressive stresses and simultaneous torsional load. An overhead crane is mechanical equipment for lifting and lowering a load and moving it horizontally, with the hoisting mechanism which {{is an integral part}} of the machine. To carry out the failure analysis of shaft it is necessary to model the shaft in any modelling software like PRO-E, CATIA etc. Then analysis of existing shaft is done analytically and with ANSYS 11. The shaft is then redesigned with suitable material available in data book of machine design and then analysis of new design of shaft is done with the help of ANSYS- 11 software...|$|R
5000|$|On 31 January 2008 {{she struck}} {{the wreck of}} [...] while {{manoeuvering}} into The Downs off the Kent coast during heavy weather. The collision caused the loss {{of one of her}} propellers and damaged the prop <b>shaft</b> and gear <b>box.</b> Although she was able to sail to Dover unaided, the ferry required assistance berthing. Following emergency repairs in Falmouth she returned to service operating with only 1 propeller. As a result, she was unable to operate in rough weather and was frequently laid up in Dover or sheltering off the Kent coast waiting for the wind to drop. The ferry was due to be drydocked at a European repair yard in November 2008 to be fitted with a new propeller with a view to being back in service for the Christmas 2008 period. The vessel is now back in service again on the Dover to Calais route.|$|R
50|$|The armored citadel can be visualized as an open-bottomed (closed top) {{rectangular}} armored raft with sloped sides sitting {{within the}} hull of the ship. From the <b>box,</b> <b>shafts</b> known as barbettes would lead upwards to the ship's main gun turrets and conning tower. Although it was desirable for the citadel to be as small as possible, the space enclosed was {{an important source of}} reserve buoyancy and helped prevent the ship from foundering when other compartments had flooded. Through compartmentalization and the redundancy of key systems, any damage done to the ship outside this armored box would likely be survivable. As long as those systems within the box remained intact, the ship could continue to fight. In effect, the scheme accepted vulnerability to medium-caliber and high-explosive shells striking the unarmored sections of the hull, in order to improve resistance against large-caliber armor-piercing shells without increasing the overall weight of armor. The unarmored parts of the ship would not offer enough resistance to armor-piercing shells to trigger their firing mechanisms (designed to explode after penetrating armor) so the shells would pass through without exploding, while the vital parts could have armor thick enough to resist the heaviest shells.|$|R
5000|$|Although the {{proposal}} made by Myers {{was adopted by}} Parliament in 1767, and £5,000 granted towards its cost, it was superseded by a plan submitted by Daviso Du Arcort, a Sardinian, otherwise known as Davis Dukart, after a second opinion on the engineering aspects {{of the project was}} sought. Dukart's plan was probably influenced by the Bridgewater Canal, which had reached Manchester in 1765. James Brindley, the engineer for that scheme, had used tub boats, capable of carrying 12 tons, and at the Castlefield terminus in Manchester, had constructed a vertical <b>shaft,</b> so that <b>boxes</b> of coal could be raised from the boats to a higher level. Dukart also planned to use 12-ton tub boats. The canal would be built on two levels, the first starting from Coalisland, and running into a tunnel, which would be used to provide drainage for Derry Colliery. A shaft would rise for 148 ft above the end of the tunnel, and coal would be lowered down it in boxes, either from the colliery workings, or from boats arriving {{at the top of the}} shaft on the upper level. The upper level would cross the River Torrent on a 3-arched aqueduct, and would again end in a tunnel.|$|R
40|$|Engineering {{machines}} {{being in}} operational service with military units of  engineer troops are fit to their purpose and their application is relevant in modern conditions. Maintenance of operating conditions in engineering equipment which was produced earlier by the USSR enterprises is {{considered as a}} rather complicated task {{due to lack of}} spare parts because their production has been discontinued. One of the approaches used for maintenance of engineering equipment combat capabilities is modernization of operating drive systems that presupposes replacement of mechanical systems in working element drives by hydrostatic drives which are realized while using modern element base. Usage of hydraulic units in drive systems being in mass production for replacement of mechanical systems manufactured earlier in small batches makes it possible to reduce labour inputs for maintenance and repair of machines. The paper presents some possibilities for development of operating drive systems in engineering equipment. The proposed approach is given through an example of  engineering obstacle-clearing vehicle (IMR- 2 M) and excavation machines (MDK- 3 and MDK- 2 M). Application of a hydraulic drive in working elements of the excavation machines permits to withdraw from cardan  <b>shafts,</b> a gear <b>box,</b> a rotary gear and an overload clutch. A hydraulic motor of the cutter and thrower drive is mounted  on a working element gearbox. While executing modernization of hydraulic systems in excavation machines a pump unit has been proposed for the cutter and thrower drive which consists of a controlled pump and a system for automatic maintenance of the pump operational parameters. While developing the operating drive systems in engineering equipment in accordance with the proposed requirements it is possible to simplify drive systems of working elements and  ensure reliable machinery operation in the units of engineer troops.  </p...|$|R
