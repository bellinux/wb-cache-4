5|$|At 10:52am on 26 March 1907, {{an express}} {{passenger}} train travelling from Heworth signal box derailed on {{the approach to}} Felling station. The cause {{was a combination of}} a sharp frost in the morning and unseasonal heat later in the day which saw the track expand and kink. The derailment, which saw all bar two carriages rolled over entirely, cost two passengers their lives, with eight more <b>seriously</b> <b>hurt</b> and a further 34 suffering minor injuries such as shock.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{lasted about}} two hours and Harrison lost 62 men (37 killed in action and 25 mortally wounded); about 126 were less <b>seriously</b> <b>hurt.</b> The Yellow Jackets {{suffered}} the highest casualties of the battle, with 30% of their numbers killed or wounded. The number of Native American casualties is still the subject of debate, but it was certainly {{lower than that of}} the United States forces. Historians estimate that as many as 50 were killed and about 70–80 were wounded.|$|E
5|$|Mario and Aldo were {{surprised}} to find a half-mile dirt racing track when they moved to Nazareth. The twins worked on a 1948 Hudson Commodore modified funded by money that they earned in their uncle's garage in 1959. They took turns racing the old Hudson on oval dirt tracks near Nazareth in 1959. They did not tell their parents that they were racing. The twins each had two wins after their first four races. Aldo was <b>seriously</b> <b>hurt</b> {{near the end of}} the season, and their parents were unhappy to find out that the twins were racing. Mario had 21 modified stockcar wins in 46 races in 1960 and 1961.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} of release Testament had not done a music video since 1994's Low and was looking at {{possibly}} using live footage as a music video to promote The Gathering. Demonic, the band's previous 1997 release, had been handled by a distribution company that went bankrupt {{to the tune of}} $44 million which had stranded most retail supply in locked warehouses and off the shelves, <b>seriously</b> <b>hurting</b> the album release.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes this {{darker side}} comes out when Vimes loses {{control of his}} anger and he {{effectively}} 'goes spare'. In Men at Arms, he temporarily gains possession of the Gonne, a malevolent firearm which drives him to violence, but he restrains the urge to [...] "make things right", enough to eventually let it go without <b>seriously</b> <b>hurting</b> anyone. In Feet of Clay, Corporal Nobby Nobbs refuses the position of King of Ankh-Morpork, primarily due to the fear of incurring Vimes's general wrath and hatred of royalty.|$|R
5000|$|Schleck {{started his}} season slowly {{as a member}} of the [...] team. He decided to ride the Giro d'Italia but withdrew on stage 15. Schleck then showed his form when he {{finished}} third in the Tour de Luxembourg and then finished second in the Tour de Suisse. He was then selected to ride the Tour de France. On the 6th stage of the race, Schleck crashed with about 25 km left, and lost just over 2 minutes, <b>seriously</b> <b>hurting</b> his chances of possibly winning the race.|$|R
5|$|The {{police have}} little success with street-level arrests or with {{securing}} informants beyond Bubbles, a well known West Side drug addict. Eventually the investigation takes {{the direction of}} electronic surveillance, with wiretaps and pager clones to infiltrate the security measures taken by the Barksdale organization. This leads the investigation to areas the commanding officers had hoped to avoid, including political contributions. When an associate of Avon Barksdale is arrested by State Police and offers to cooperate, the commanding officers order the detail to undertake a sting operation to wrap up the case. Detective Kima Greggs is <b>seriously</b> <b>hurt</b> in the operation, triggering an overzealous response {{from the rest of}} the department. This causes the detail's targets to suspect that they are under investigation.|$|E
5|$|Earp {{was named}} deputy sheriff {{in the area}} {{including}} newly incorporated Kootenai County, Idaho, which was disputing jurisdiction of Eagle City with Shoshone County. There were {{a considerable number of}} disagreements over mining claims and property rights, which Earp had a part in. On March 28, several feet of snow were still on the ground. Bill Buzzard, a miner of dubious reputation, began constructing a building when one of Wyatt's partners, Jack Enright, tried to stop the construction. Enright claimed the building was on part of his property. Words were exchanged and Buzzard reached for his Winchester. He fired several shots at Enright and a skirmish developed. Allies of both sides quickly took defensive positions between snowbanks and began shooting at one another. Deputy Sheriff Wyatt Earp and his brother James stepped {{into the middle of the}} fray and helped peacefully resolve the dispute before anyone was <b>seriously</b> <b>hurt.</b> Shoshone County Deputy W. E. Hunt then arrived and ordered the parties to turn over their weapons.|$|E
5|$|Alumni Hall was {{constructed}} by the Benedictine monks and local contractors from 1891 through the winter of 1892; the building was designed by Patrick W. Ford, an Irish-American architect from Boston. Nearing completion in February 1892, {{all that remained was}} for workers to continue to plaster the interior walls; sadly, a fire which was most likely caused by a heating stove's gate not closed completely, sparked an ember and destroyed the entire structure. Thankfully, no one was <b>seriously</b> <b>hurt</b> because of the fire. The monks were forced to rebuild the college, spending considerably less money on the construction, as they had only received $55,000 from the Insurance Commissioner of the State of New Hampshire. In an effort to save money, many bricks were salvaged from the previous structure and pieces of granite were cut from large granite rocks still visible on the current quad. In 1893, the current building that remains the center of campus was completed; the fire delayed the first academic semester by one year. To avoid the possibility of another fire, a power house {{was constructed}} separately from the building. Farmland complete with livestock, beanpoles and tomato plants lined the present-day quad and adjacent fields, as the monks were completely self-sufficient. In 1912, the bell tower (the inside is pictured to the right) and ivy were added to the building; in 1923, the college's second chapel (the first being located on the second floor at the present-day business office) was constructed as a connecting wing. Today this second chapel is the college's Chapel Arts Center, which hosts art exhibits and other cultural events. It still boasts ornate stained glass windows and painted ceilings.|$|E
40|$|The {{proliferation}} of online information resources increases {{the importance of}} effective and efficient distributed searching. However, the problem of word mismatch <b>seriously</b> <b>hurts</b> the effectiveness of distributed information retrieval. Automatic query expansion has been suggested as a technique {{for dealing with the}} fundamental issue of word mismatch. In this paper, we propose a method - query expansion with Naive Bayes to address the problem, discuss its implementation in IISS system, and present experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness. Such technique not only enhances the discriminatory power of typical queries for choosing the right collections but also hence significantly improves retrieval results...|$|R
5000|$|Prior to {{the launch}} of Sputnik in 1957, Carlisle read {{an article in the}} February 1957 issue of Popular Mechanics by G. Harry Stine, then an {{engineer}} working at White Sands Missile Range. The article remarked on the danger that individuals (mostly teenage boys), inspired by the birth of the Space Age, might experiment with rockets of their own design and end up <b>seriously</b> <b>hurting</b> themselves or even dying. Carlisle realized that he had a solution to this problem with his [...] "Rock-A-Chute" [...] models and engines, a few of which he boxed up and shipped to Stine.|$|R
50|$|In the epilogue, Walter {{determines that}} the only way to stop seeing visions of Peter is to perform his own lobotomy. Olivia arrives in the lab in time to prevent Walter from <b>seriously</b> <b>hurting</b> himself and learns that he has been seeing an unknown man for several weeks. Olivia pulls out a sketch that she drew of a man, the same person that Walter has been seeing, and Walter realizes that he is not insane. Olivia admits she does not know who the man is, as he does not appear in the FBI database. The two agree they need to figure out his {{identity}} together.|$|R
5|$|The first {{bishop of}} Manchester, Denis Mary Bradley, invited the Benedictine monks of St. Mary's Abbey in Newark, New Jersey, {{to form a}} college and preparatory school in his diocese. The monks that came to Manchester from Saint Mary's were {{primarily}} of German descent. This {{is due to the}} fact that Manchester was heavily populated with French Canadian and Irish immigrant mill workers, and Bradley was unable to find a suitable religious community that would not stir up ethnic tensions. The German monks accepted, and founded the third Catholic college in New England. On August 1, 1889, the New Hampshire legislature approved the incorporation of the Order of Saint Benedict of New Hampshire “for religious and charitable purposes, for the education of youth, for establishing churches and conducting services therein.” This historic date marked the founding of Saint Anselm College. A six-year curriculum in philosophy and theology was developed. In 1892, as Alumni Hall neared completion, a fire destroyed the college on a cold winter night in February. The fire was most likely caused from an ember from the heating stove's gate as it was not closed properly. Thankfully, no one was <b>seriously</b> <b>hurt</b> because of the fire. The monks were forced to rebuild the college, spending considerably less money on the construction, as they had received only $55,000 from the Insurance Commissioner of the State of New Hampshire. To save money, many bricks were salvaged from the previous structure and pieces of granite were cut from large granite rocks still visible on the current quad. In 1893, the current building that remains the center of campus was completed; the fire delayed the first academic semester by one year. The monks rebuilt the college, and on October 11, 1893 the college was officially rededicated. To avoid the possibility of another fire, a power house, which today serves as the college print shop, was constructed separately from the building. Two years later, in 1895, the New Hampshire legislature granted Saint Anselm College the right to bestow standard academic degrees upon its graduates. In 1912, the bell tower and ivy were added to the building; in 1923, the college's second chapel (the first being located on the second floor at the present-day business office) was constructed as a connecting wing. The second chapel serves today as the Alva deMars Megan Chapel Arts Center.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discussed}} {{the most striking}} recent research claims indicating that growing income inequality is <b>seriously</b> <b>hurting</b> the U. S. economy, challenging a long-standing consensus that inequality is the price America pays for a dynamic, efficient economy. The Gini Coefficient, an indicator of income inequality, suggested {{that by the year}} 2021, the US is on track to reach as much income inequality as Mexico experienced in 2000. There are growing indications that it is virtually impossible for people {{at the bottom of the}} pyramid to propel themselves out of poverty. The data suggested the US is becoming more of a caste-like society in which individuals that are born poor will likely remain poor, while individuals born wealthy will very likely remain so...|$|R

A 15 -year-old also asks, “Is it bad?” A 16 -year-old asks, “How do I stop feeling guilty after I do it?” Another 16 -year-old asks, ”Will people {{be able to tell}} that I do it?” And another asks, “Can masturbating hurt you in any way?” And another asks, “Is {{there such a thing as}} too much masturbation?...|$|R
50|$|Cyril {{starts off}} this season {{working in the}} kitchen and {{essentially}} shadowing his brother. The Aryan inmates, especially Schillinger and James Robson, taunt Cyril and Ryan continuously over the rape he suffered at Schillinger's hands. Ryan wants to kill Schillinger, but does not get a chance. Cyril goes to work early one day, against Ryan's wishes, and Robson tries to rape him. Cyril fights back, <b>seriously</b> <b>hurting</b> his would-be assailant. McManus wants to put Cyril in isolation, but new head CO Sean Murphy suggests that Cyril be let off with a warning. Murphy is Black Irish like the O'Reily brothers and understands that Ryan is trying to protect him. Murphy also helps McManus start the prison boxing tournament where each competitor represents one prison group. Ryan enrolls Cyril, who used to box before his injury, in the tournament to show everyone in Oz that Cyril is physically powerful.|$|R

50|$|In {{the tenth}} round Tyson pushed forward to fight, {{but he was}} still <b>seriously</b> <b>hurting</b> from the {{accumulation}} of punishment given throughout the match. As Tyson walked forward, Douglas measured him with a few jabs before landing a devastating uppercut that snapped Tyson's head upward, stopping Tyson in his tracks. As Tyson began to reel back from the uppercut, Douglas immediately followed with four punches to the head, knocking Tyson down {{for the first time in}} his career. In a famous scene, Tyson fumbled for his mouthpiece on the canvas before sticking one end in his mouth with the other end hanging out. The champion attempted to make it back to his feet to continue fighting but referee Octavio Meyran counted him out. Buster Douglas thus became the new undisputed heavyweight champion and the fight became one of the biggest upsets in boxing history.|$|R
5000|$|After being {{rescued from}} an anti-Apocalypse cult {{by the new}} team, Polaris agreed to join Professor X, Darwin, Havok, Marvel Girl, Nightcrawler, and Warpath on their mission to stop Vulcan.

Polaris seemed to finally show concrete signs of forgiving Havok, telling him to [...] "just shut up and kiss me" [...] after the team won their first battle against the entire regiment of Shi'ar soldiers in their beginning struggle against D'Ken and in support of Lilandra. Although Havok initially rebuffs her advances, hesitant to [...] "start up again after" [...] everything that happened between them, Lorna says {{that he needs to}} [...] "blow off some steam" [...] and the scene ends with them kissing.

It quite reminds me of old tree-cutting days at Feniton; only here I see no oaks, nor elms, nor beeches, nor firs, only bread-fruit trees and almond trees, and many fruit-bearing trees--oranges, &c., and guavas and custard-apples--growing up (all being introduced by us), and the two gigantic banyan trees, north and south of my little place.

60|$|The more Bartley dwelt {{upon his}} hard case, {{during the week}} that followed, the more it {{appeared}} {{to him that he}} was punished out of all proportion to his offence. He was in no mood to consider such mercies as that he had been spared from <b>seriously</b> <b>hurting</b> Bird; and that Squire Gaylord and Doctor Wills had united with Henry's mother in saving him from open disgrace. The physician, indeed, had perhaps indulged a professional passion for hushing the matter up, rather than any pity for Bartley. He probably had the scientific way of looking at such questions; and saw much physical cause for moral effects. He refrained, with the physician's reticence, from inquiring into the affair; but he would not have thought Bartley without excuse under the circumstances. In regard to the relative culpability in matters of the kind, his knowledge of women enabled him to take much the view of the woman's share that other women take.|$|R

Nor must I omit the helm itself, which was one of a new construction, and a particular favorite of the captain. It was a complex system of cogs and wheels and spindles, all of polished brass, and looked something like a printing-press, or power-loom. The sailors, however, did not like it much, owing to the casualties that happened to their imprudent fingers, by catching in among the cogs and other intricate contrivances. Then, sometimes in a calm, when the sudden swells would lift the ship, the helm would fetch a lurch, and send the helmsman revolving round like Ixion, often <b>seriously</b> <b>hurting</b> him; a sort of breaking on the wheel.|$|R
