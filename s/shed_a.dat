5|$|Some prey {{species are}} capable of {{fighting}} back against predators, whether with chemicals, through communal defence, or by ejecting noxious materials. Many animals can escape by fleeing rapidly, outrunning or outmanoeuvring their attacker. Finally, some species are able to escape even when caught by sacrificing certain body parts: crabs can <b>shed</b> <b>a</b> claw, while lizards can shed their tails, often distracting predators long enough to permit the prey to escape.|$|E
5|$|Razer's next {{appearance}} {{came in a}} Robot Wars Christmas special {{called the}} Southern Annihilator. Six robots fought {{at the same time}} until one was eliminated, either through immobilisation or judges' decision. The remaining five robots then fought again, eliminating another, and so on until one robot remained and was declared the winner. Razer outlasted Vercingetorix, SpawnofScutter, Behemoth and AttilatheDrum to set up a final against Onslaught. An attack by Razer's arm on one of Onslaught's rear wheels saw its adversary <b>shed</b> <b>a</b> tyre, lose grip, and drive into an area patrolled by Matilda. The house robot flipped Onslaught onto its side, rendering it immobile. Assured of victory, Razer attacked and badly damaged Matilda's bodywork and rear shell.|$|E

40|$|Optimal load <b>shedding</b> is <b>a</b> very {{critical}} issue in power systems. It plays a vital role, especially {{in third world}} countries. A {{sudden increase in load}} can affect the important parameters of the power system like voltage, frequency and phase angle. This paper presents a case study of Pakistan’s power system, where the generated power, the load demand, frequency deviation and load <b>shedding</b> during <b>a</b> 24 -hour period have been provided. An artificial neural network ensemble is aimed for optimal load shedding. The objective {{of this paper is to}} maintain power system frequency stability by <b>shedding</b> <b>an</b> accurate amount of load. Due to its fast convergence and improved generalization ability, the proposed algorithm helps to deal with load <b>shedding</b> in <b>an</b> efficient manner...|$|R
