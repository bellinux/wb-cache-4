5|$|Although figs flower asynchronously as a population, in {{most species}} {{flowering}} is synchronised within an individual. Newly emerged female wasps must {{move away from}} their natal tree {{in order to find}} figs in which to lay their eggs. This is to the advantage of the fig, since it prevents <b>self-pollination.</b> In Florida, individual F. aurea trees flower and fruit asynchronously. Within-tree asynchrony in flowering is likely to raise the probability of <b>self-pollination,</b> but it may be an adaptation that allows the species to maintain an adequate population of wasps at low population densities or in strongly seasonal climates.|$|E
5|$|Erythranthe guttata is pollinated by bees, such as Bombus impatiens. Inbreeding reduces flower {{quantity}} and size and pollen quality and quantity. E. guttata also displays {{a high degree}} of <b>self-pollination.</b> Erythranthe nasuta evolved from E. guttata in central California between 200,000 and 500,000 years ago and since then has become primarily a self-pollinator.|$|E
5|$|Sycamore {{trees are}} very {{variable}} across their wide range and have strategies to prevent <b>self-pollination,</b> which is undesirable because it limits the genetic {{variation of the}} progeny and may depress their vigour. Most inflorescences are formed of a mixture of functionally male and functionally female flowers. On any one tree, one or other of these flower types opens first and the other type opens later. Some trees may be male-starters in one year and female-starters in another. The change from one sex to the other may take place on different dates {{in different parts of}} the crown, and different trees in any one population may come into bloom over the course of several weeks, so that cross-pollination is encouraged, although <b>self-pollination</b> may not be completely prevented.|$|E
40|$|DNA {{methylation}} is an epigenetic mark {{important for}} heterochromatin silencing and regulation of gene expression. In plants, DNA methylation is observed in cytosines {{in all of}} contexts, CG, CHG, and CHH. DNA methylation in all contexts of cytosines depends on a SWI 2 /SNF 2 chromatin remodeling factor called DDM 1 (decrease in DNA methylation 1). In the ddm 1 mutant, DNA methylation was reduced globally, and silent repetitive elements were de-repressed. Although ddm 1 mutant initially grows normally, various developmental abnormalities were induced during repeated <b>self-pollinations.</b> Most of the abnormalities were induced by de-repression of silent element caused by the DNA hypomethylation. However, one abnormal phenotype named bonsai (bns) was associated with DNA hyper-methylation and silencing of the responsible gene, BNS, which encodes a protein similar to Anaphase Promoting Complex 13 (APC 13). BNS locus is hyper-methylated locally {{in the background of}} global hypomethylation. To understand this enigmatic phenomenon, here I examined the factors involved in the BNS hyper-methylation. In addition, I analyzed effect of the ddm 1 -induced DNA hyper-methylation in genome-wide level. 　　　To understand the factors required for this phenomenon, I first generated double mutants between ddm 1 and various factors involved in the epigenetic modifications. After repeated <b>self-pollinations,</b> I examined DNA methylation states in BNS locus. Previously-characterized components of RdDM pathway were dispensable for ddm 1 -induced BNS methylation. On the other hand, mutation in plant-specific DNA methyltransferase, CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT 3) suppressed the induction of DNA hyper-methylation. CMT 3 was considered as a DNA methyltransferase for maintenance of non-CG methylation. The mutation in KRYPTONITE (KYP), a histone H 3 K 9 methyltransferase which directs non-CG methylation by CMT 3, also suppressed the induction of BNS methylation. These results indicate that ddm 1 -induced BNS methylation was mediated by KYP and CMT 3, rather than RdDM pathway. 　　　Next, to understand the genome-wide effect of ddm 1 -induced DNA hyper-methylation, I examined global states of DNA methylation in ddm 1 mutant by MeDIP-chip analysis. Consistent with previous reports, drastic reduction of DNA methylation in transposable elements was observed as a rapid effect in ddm 1 mutant. During <b>self-pollinations,</b> DNA methylation states changed in many loci. Some loci kept decreasing DNA methylation during <b>self-pollinations.</b> I also found numerous loci which behave in BNS -like manner. Induction of DNA methylation was observed in both genes and transposable elements. The slow DNA hyper-methylation was induced in all the three contexts, but it was generally most frequent at CHG sites. Compared to genic regions, induction of DNA hyper-methylation in transposable elements tend to be moderate. In most loci, as was the case for the BNS locus, induction of DNA hyper-methylation was suppressed in the ddm 1 kyp double mutant. 　　　In this study, I showed KYP and CMT 3 mediated induction of DNA methylation in ddm 1 mutant. Interestingly, although KYP and CMT 3 were considered as components required for the maintenance of DNA methylation in non-CG contexts, this study revealed that they are also involved in induction of DNA methylation including CG context in ddm 1 background. KYP has a SRA domain, which can bind to methylated DNA, and CMT 3 has a chromo-domain, which can bind to methylated histone, so they could be recruited to epigenetic modifications catalyzed by the other factor. This self-reinforcement mechanism may be involved in the spreading of DNA methylation in ddm 1 mutant...|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} studies, we {{have investigated}} the strength of self-incompatibility (SI) in Solanum carolinense, a highly successful weed with a fully functional SI system that inhabits early successional and other disturbed habitats. We {{have found that the}} SI response in S. carolinense is a plastic trait—its strength being affected by the age of the flowers, and the presence of developing fruits and that there are genetic differences among families in their self-fertility. However, in species with a fully functional SI response, selfing would not be that common. As a result, deleterious recessives scattered though the genome of horsenettle are only occasionally exposed to selection. It has been suggested that deleterious recessives accumulate near S-alleles in strong SI species because the S-locus is located in a non-recombining region of the genome and because strong S-alleles are never in the homozygous state, thus sheltering some of the genetic load near the S-locus from selection. We performed a series of laboratory and greenhouse experiments {{to determine the extent to}} which sheltered load adds to the overall magnitude of inbreeding depression in horsenettle. Specifically, we amplified and sequenced the S-alleles from 16 genets collected from a large population in Pennsylvania and performed a series of controlled <b>self-pollinations.</b> We then grew the selfed progeny in the greenhouse; recorded various measures of growth and reproductive output; and amplified and sequenced their S-allele(s). We found that the heterozygous progeny of <b>self-pollinations</b> produce more flowers and have a greater ability to set both self and cross seed than S-homozygous progeny. We also found evidence of variation in the magnitude of load among S-alleles. These results suggest that sheltered load might slow the fixation of weak (partially compatible) S-alleles in this population, thus adding to the maintenance of a mixed mating system rather than leading to the fixation of the selfing allele...|$|R

Heredity, 94 (3), 356 - 363. Sponsorship: BBSRCThe two-locus gametophytic {{incompatibility}} system in perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) is not always fully effective: obligate selfing of plants sieves self-compatible pollen mutants, and self-fertility becomes fixed in subsequent generations. Self-compatibility (SC) was investigated in an F 2 family. In vitro <b>self-pollinations</b> were analysed and recorded and plants were classified as being either partially or fully compatible. Distorted segregation ratios of markers on linkage group (LG) 5 were found, which indicate the possible presence of a gametophytic SC locus. Interval linkage analysis of pollen compatibility after selfing confirmed that this distortion was due to a locus (T) analogous to the S 5 locus of rye. However, even though markers in this region were, on average, less than 1 cM apart, the minimum number of plants possessing the unfavoured allele was never less than 6 % for any marker locus. We proved that this {{was because of the}} presence of another SC locus, exhibiting gametophytic selection, segregating in this population and identified by interval mapping analysis of compatibility classes of in vitro <b>self-pollinations.</b> This locus was located on LG 1, and probably corresponds to the S locus. We show that the T locus, a relic of a multilocus system, functions through interaction with the S locus: F 2 segregation of incompatibility phenotypes and linked markers demonstrated that the S/t pollen genotype combination, expected to be compatible on selfing, was sometimes incompatible. Further evidence is presented to show that this interaction must be dependent on yet another locus located on LG 2. A prime candidate would be the Z incompatibility locus. Peer reviewe...|$|R
5|$|In Nicotiana attenuata HypSys {{is known}} to not be {{involved}} in defence against insect herbivores. Silencing and over-expression of HypSys {{does not affect the}} feeding performance of larvae compared to normal plants. Berger silenced HypSys and found that it caused changes in flower morphology which reduced the efficiency of <b>self-pollination.</b> The flowers had pistils that protruded beyond their anthers, a similar phenotype to CORONATINE-INSENSITIVE1-silenced plants which lack a jasmonate receptor. Measurement of jasmonate levels in the flowers revealed that they were lower than in normal plants. The authors suggested that HypSys peptides in N. attenuata have diversified from their function as defence related peptides to being involved in controlling flower morphology. The signalling processes remain similar however, being mediated through jasmonates.|$|E
5|$|Some species, {{such as the}} Uruguayan Hippeastrum petiolatum, are sterile {{and unable}} to produce seeds. H. petiolatum is a sterile {{triploid}} that reproduces asexually, producing many bulbils around the mother bulb. These are light, and easily carried {{on the surface of}} water ensuring distribution of the species during the rainy season. Other species such as Hippeastrum reticulatum are self-pollinating, reproducing by distributing seed. Although this does not guarantee genetic diversity in natural populations, it is widely used by colonising species. These two examples are not however typical of the genus, which commonly reproduces through allogamy. One mechanism that limits <b>self-pollination</b> is that of self-incompatibility by which seeds are only produced by pollination from other plants. Furthermore, the plant generally releases its pollen about two days before its stigma is receptive, making cross-pollination more likely. Pollinators include Humming birds in subtropical areas, and moths.|$|E
25|$|Since most plants carry {{both male}} and female {{reproductive}} organs in their flowers, there is a high risk of <b>self-pollination</b> and thus inbreeding. Some plants use the control of pollen germination as a way to prevent this <b>self-pollination.</b> Germination and growth of the pollen tube involve molecular signaling between stigma and pollen. In self-incompatibility in plants, the stigma of certain plants can molecularly recognize pollen from the same plant and prevent it from germinating.|$|E
40|$|The {{inheritance}} {{of resistance to}} Meloidogyne chitwoodi and M. fallax in Solanum fendleri, S. hougassii and S. stoloniferum was studied assuming disomic behaviour of these polyploid Solanum species. Various populations were produced from crosses within the wild Solanum species; resistant x susceptible and reciprocal crosses (F 1), <b>self-pollinations</b> (S(1)), testcrosses (TC) and <b>self-pollinations</b> (F 2) of resistant hybrids, if possible. For the test crosses with S. houyasii, susceptible genotypes of S. iopetalum were used. In seedling tests, numbers of egg masses were counted after inoculation with M. chitwoodi or M. fallax. Almost all seedlings of the F 1 and S 1 populations of S. fendleri appeared to be resistant, whereas the TC and F 2 populations of three different resistant hybrid genotypes segregated into resistant (having 1 or no egg mass) and susceptible plants (having more than 1 egg mass) at ratios of 1 : 1 and 3 : 1, respectively. The results clearly indicate the action of a single dominantly inherited gene, and the symbol R(M 02) is proposed for this gene. In the case of S. hougasii, F 1 and S 1 seedlings appeared to be mostly resistant. Difficulties were met in producing TC and F 2 populations, and only four TC populations were obtained, which segregated at a 1 : 1 ratio. These results also indicate {{the presence of a}} simple dominant factor. For both S. fendleri and S. hougasii no differences were observed between M. chitwoodi and M. fallax, indicating that resistance genes are the same for both nematode species. The F 1, S 1 and TC populations of S. stoloniferum segregated for the square root number of egg masses into normal-like distributions, which deviated between the Meloidogyne species used. The patterns indicate the presence of several additive genes and one or more genes effective to M. fallax but not to M. chitwoodi.

In terms of cytological analysis, for both kinds of plants, WCF and PCF, the meiotic behavior was considered regular, considering the high meiotic index estimated for both of them, 96. 3 % and 97. 7 %, and pollen viability, 98 % and 99. 5 %, respectively.

This protein reacts with a monoclonal antibody specific to the wheat 1 Dx 5 subunit and was not detected in nontransgenic controls or in pollen, anthers, leaves or embryos of plants grown from seeds expressing this protein in endosperm. Genomic Southern-blot analysis is consistent with results from SDS-PAGE and indicates that the transgene integration sites are complex and are different in the four events studied.

Preliminary observations have indicated that these new clones have differing growth patterns and agronomic traits in the field. Assessing their compatibility is of paramount importance since these clones will be made available to the farmers in the near future. This study was conducted in Soubré, southwest of Côte d’Ivoire, to evaluate the compatibility of ten new cocoa clones (coded as C 1, C 8, C 9, C 14, C 15, C 16, C 17, C 18, C 20, and C 21). A half diallel design consisting of 10 <b>self-pollinations</b> and 45 inter-crosses, replicated three times, was used. Results showed significant differences among clones for pollination success. Out of the ten clones evaluated, six (C 1, C 8, C 9, C 15, C 17 and C 21) were self-compatible. With a 39 % mean pollination success, C 9 was quite interesting because it has been reported to be among the highest yielding clones.

There is, however, limited evidence for the applicability of Baker 2 ̆ 7 s Rule to invasive plants. We determined the breeding systems of three invasive milkweed species-Asclepias curassavica, Gomphocarpus fruticosus and G. physocarpus-in their invaded range in south-east Queensland, Australia. Although dependent on pollinators for reproduction, hand-pollinations revealed that all three species are self-compatible {{which is consistent with}} Baker 2 ̆ 7 s Rule and notable because milkweeds are generally self-incompatible. In progeny performance trials, seedlings from <b>self-pollinations</b> generally did not perform as well as those from cross-pollinations, but the differences were minor. Evidence for self-compatibility in G. physocarpus is a particularly noteworthy feature of this study, as this species has been reported to be self-incompatible in its native range and may thus have evolved self-compatibility during the invasion process. Furthermore, potential for hybridization between the two Gomphocarpus species was observed. Hybridization may have assisted the invasion of these species through providing additional sources of pollen and/or broadening genetic variation. Our study adds to the growing evidence that breeding systems are significant for the process of plant invasion...|$|R

This study aimed to investigate the phenology, features of distyly, reproductive biology, and floral visitors of Psychotria goyazensis Mull. Arg. (Rubiaceae), an intramorph self-compatible species, in a tropical semideciduous forest in the municipality of Catalão, located {{in the state of}} Goiás, Brazil. The phenology was recorded for a sample of individuals, the floral morphology being described using fresh and fixed material. The incompatibility system was tested using controlled hand pollinations. Floral visitors were collected and identified. Blooming began in November 2009 and ended in April 2010. Fruits developed from December 2009 to March 2010. The population presented atypical distyly, because only plants with pin flowers were found. The intramorph and open pollinations set more fruits than did spontaneous <b>self-pollinations.</b> The main flower visitors were Systropus sp. (Diptera), as well as Hymenoptera and Lepidoptera species. Morphological variations in distyly can occur by breakdown/permutation of the gene that controls the polymorphism.

40|$|In {{the present}} {{investigation}} of Brassica cretica, a wild relative of the cultivated cabbage, B. oleracea, we performed an extensive crossing experiment, involving <b>self-pollinations,</b> random outcrosses within populations and hybridizations between populations or species, to evaluate the relationship between crossing distance and developmental stability, estimated as the absolute difference between {{the right and left}} lobe of the cotyledons. The frequency distribution of the right-minus-left scores had a narrower peak than expected for normally-distributed data, but there was no directional asymmetry or antisymmetry. Despite evidence for inbreeding depression in seedling biomass and cotyledon size, the type of cross had negligible influence on cotyledon asymmetry. Separate analyses of between-population hybrids revealed differences among progenies from different pairs of populations and a tendency for the F 1 hybrid means to decrease with the geographic distance separating the parent populations, but only for the two size variables. Based on these and other observations, we propose that the degree of cotyledon asymmetry is unrelated to genome-wide characteristics, such as the level of heterozygosity and genomic co-adaptation, and that cotyledon asymmetry is unrelated to the level of genetic stress experienced by each individual. Hence, {{there is no reason to}} consider measures of asymmetry as more sensitive indicators of genetic health than conventional fitness variables...|$|R

In this environment, local adaptation of populations is expected to lead to greater endemism and outbreeding depression. Anthropogenic fragmentation has further isolated populations, however, which paradoxically could result in inbreeding depression. One of these plants, Erysimum teretifolium (Ben Lomond wallflower) is an endangered endemic herb in the Brassicaceae family. This study assessed genetic mixing across remnant patches of E. teretifolium in order to estimate the effects of fragmentation and the reliance on pollinators. A captive breeding colony was established from seeds collected from four locations across the Zayante sandhills and used in 161 pollinations. Individual allele frequencies were measured using microsatellites, and pollination potential was evaluated through insect camera trapping. <b>Self-pollinations</b> produced 6. 5 times fewer seeds than outcrosses. There is no evidence of outbreeding depression. Results suggest that there is a potential for inbreeding depression; however, it is possible that self-incompatibility and reliance on pollinators for outcrosses across geographic divides may be buffering effects. Implications for managers include evidence that geographic origin of individuals may not be critical for reintroduction; however, conservation of the pollinator community should remain a priority...|$|R

This maintenance of copy number can be accounted for by an extremely high rate of transposition of the Mu elements (10 – 15 transpositions per gamete per generation). When Mutator plants are self-pollinated, the progeny double their Mu copy number in the first generation, but maintain a constant number of Mu sequences with subsequent <b>self-pollinations.</b> Transposition of Mu and the events that lead to copy number maintenance occur very late {{in the development of the}} germ cells but before fertilization.

40|$|Plants of the {{partially}} self-incompatible perennial herb Brassica cretica, derived from contralled cross- and <b>self-pollinations</b> {{within each of}} seven populations, were raised under uniform conditions and scored for two measures of developmental stability, flower asymmetry (quantified as the difference in length and width between opposite petals) and cotyledon asymmetry (quantified as {{the difference in the}} area of the two lobes of each cotyledon). The primary goals were to assess the level of heritable variation in asymmetry, the effect of selling on mean asymmetry, and the relationship between asymmetry and components of fitness. A paternal half-sibling analysis of data an flower asymmetry failed to detect significant levels of genetic variation at the within-population levee, whereas the between-population component reached significance for all measures of asymmetry. Analysis of family-structured data from another crossing experiment revealed significant between-population variation in cotyledon asymmetry and a tendency for inbred progeny to produce more asymmetric cotyledons than outbred progeny. However, the response to inbreeding was weak and differed in magnitude between populations. Judging from the ranking of populations, we found no support for the hypothesis that the mean expression of developmental stability is controlled by genomewide characteristics such as the level of inbreeding. Correlations between measures of asymmetry and fitness were too low to be declared statistically or biologically significant. The present study provides little evidence that flower and cotyledon asymmetry serve as more appropriate predictors of genetic health than conventional (direct) measures of fitness...|$|R
25|$|Flowers are {{produced}} early in spring, with or slightly {{ahead of the}} first pitchers. They are held singly on long stems, generally well above the pitcher traps to avoid the trapping of potential pollinators. The flowers, which depending on species are 3–10 centimeters in diameter, are dramatic and have an elaborate design which prevents <b>self-pollination.</b> It consists of five sepals superintended by three bracts, numerous anthers, and an umbrella-like five-pointed style, over which five long yellow or red petals dangle.

The primary pollinators are bees. Bees searching for nectar must force their way past one of the stigmas to enter the chamber formed by the style. Inside, they will inevitably come in contact with a lot of pollen, both from the hanging anthers and from the pollen collected by the style. Upon exiting, the bees must force their way under one of the flap-like petals.

However, as opposed to 'complete' or 'absolute' SI, in CSI, <b>self-pollination</b> without the presence of competing cross pollen, results in successive fertilization and seed set; in this way, reproduction is assured, {{even in the absence of}} cross-pollination. CSI acts, at least in some species, at the stage of pollen tube elongation, and leads to faster elongation of cross pollen tubes, relative to self pollen tubes. The cellular and molecular mechanisms of CSI have not been described.|$|E
40|$|Several {{ecological}} {{characteristics in}} tetraploid F_ 1 hybrids of snapdragon (2 n= 32), Antirrhinam majus, raised artificially had been studied from 1951 through 1960. The author also carried out some trials on the breeding features of these F_ 1 forms {{in order to}} make their intensive use to be practicable. Results obtained are summarized as follows: 1. On the flowering time of F_ 1 hybrids definite heterosis was uniformly obtained in the earliness of blooming. 2. A positive heterotic phenomenon in the plant height of F_ 1 hybrids could not be observed. However, on the number of leaves developed distinctive heterosis was observed in several F_ 1 hybrids. 3. The grade of fertility through cross-pollinations was somewhat lower than that through <b>self-pollinations</b> as well as diploid snapdragon, and mother strains showing higher fertility by selfing could produce higher yield of seeds. Though the seedfertility of 4 x snapdragon usually showed low degree, their F_ 1 hybrids had, in general, a good yield of seeds. And 4 x F_ 1 hybrids had higher regularity of mitosis as compared with their mother strains. From such results, the further progress of introducing superior 4 x forms will become available by utilizing F_ 2 generations. 人工交配によるキンギョソウ 4 x F_ 1,雑種のしめす生態的諸特性について 1951 年から 1960 年まで行なつた研究の概要について報告する. 1) 4 x F_ 1 雑種はその親系統に比較して到花日数は少なく,早生性においてヘテローシス現象をしめした. 2) 草丈においてはF_ 1 雑種にはヘテローシスは引きおこされなかつたが,葉数に関しては明確なヘテローシスを確察した. 3) 2 xキンギョソウにおいて見られたと同様,交雑授粉よりも,自花授粉による種子稔性が優れており, 4 xの場合も,自家授粉によつてより高い種子稔性をしめす系統を供用することによつてより高い種子稔性でF_ 1 雑種が得られた. 一般に 4 xキンギョソウは極めて低い種子稔性をしめすが,F_ 1 雑種は高い種子稔性をしめした. また,その減数分裂は,F_ 1 雑種世代は,その母系統に比して規則正しいことが観察された. これらの結果から,F_ 2 利用によつて 4 xキンギョソウのすぐれたものが実際に利用されるようになると考えられる...|$|R
40|$|The {{pollination}} {{biology and}} breeding system of Couepia uiti was studied. In this species, flowers opened at 06 : 00 AM anthesis, and nectar production began at around 0800 h, reached a maximum volume from 09 : 30 AM to 10 : 30 AM, and decreased thereafter. The nectar sugar concentration increased continuously, but showed an abrupt increase from 10 : 00 AM to 12 : 00 AM. Pollen release occurred at about 09 : 30 AM and was quickly collected. The stigmas became receptive at around 12 : 00 AM. The pollinators of C. uiti included the bees Apis mellifera, Xylocopa sp. and Bombus sp., and three species of wasps. This conclusion {{was based on}} the observation that these hymenopterans had C. uiti pollen on their bodies, visited the receptive flowers, and touched the anthers and stigmas, thereby promoting pollination. Of these floral visitors, A. mellifera was considered to be the most efficient pollinator. However, mixed pollination also occurred. The number of C. uiti flowers visited in the morning (n = 52) was three times smaller than in the afternoon (n = 62), and the species richness of floral visitors was also bigger in the afternoon (eight in the afternoon versus five in the morning). This finding indicated that these floral visitors preferred to exploit nectar rather than pollen. Controlled pollination experiments showed that C. uiti was a self-incompatible species that produced fruits only by cross-pollination. Treatments such as agamospermy and spontaneous and <b>self-pollinations</b> did not produce fruits...|$|R
40|$|Cosmos atrosanguineus, {{exhibits}} strong sporophytic self-incompatibility (SSI), {{does not}} set seed, {{and must be}} propagated vegetatively, a factor that {{has contributed to the}} proliferation of closely related or identical genotypes. Microsporogenesis within the species appears normal, with no discernible differences between microsporogenesis in C. atrosanguineus and two seed-producing Cosmos species. The C. atrosanguineus karyotype and chromosome associations at meiosis identify the species as an allotetraploid that produces viable gametes with ~ 30 % pollen viability. Self- and cross-pollinations of C. atrosanguineus are strongly incompatible with an average of zero pollen grains germinating per stigma. In contrast, cross and <b>self-pollinations</b> in C. bipinnatus and C. sulphurous produced three compatibility groups; incompatible (-), compatible (+) and semi-compatible (±) and four categories of pollen-stigma interaction that putatively identify a gametophytic-sporophytic (G-S) incompatibility system in Cosmos. Dominance interactions of S-alleles are prevalent in the genus and pseudo-self-compatibility was observed in C. bipinnatus but not C. atrosanguineus. The Cosmos stigma is dry, papillate and becomes receptive only after stigmas become reflexed. Prior to this period, the stigmas do not respond to pollination and selfed bud pollinations and crossed bud pollinations are incompatible. Degenerate S-specific primers identified 41 S-domain-encoding sequences from Cosmos and four other genera of Asteraceae. These 41 Asteraceae sequences encoded S-domains related to Brassica S-domain proteins, but none identified as a putative self-incompatible molecule, indicating the control of SI in Cosmos is probably different to that in Brassica. Genetic fingerprinting (AFLP) of various European sources of C. atrosanguineus showed no genetic variation. In conclusion, Cosmos atrosanguineus is a strongly self-compatible species with a reduced genome. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
