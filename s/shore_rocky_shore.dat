40|$|The {{biodiversity}} of Gulf of Kutch is studied {{well with}} special reference to scleretinia and mollusca but the brachyuran crab taxa are rather neglected. Gulf of Kutch is very rich in floral and faunal diversity and comprises {{different types of}} communities and habitats like very unique coral reefs, mangroves, sandy <b>shores,</b> <b>rocky</b> <b>shores</b> and mudflats. Brachyuran crabs are the most diverse group among marine fauna having 5000 species world wide.

Present work on Gulf of Kutch is an initiative to scan the entire coastal Gujarat and establish directory of brachyuran crab diversity. Since the Gulf habitat is diverse and distinct, eight different stations (16 sample sites) were sampled. The selection of the sample site was done on the basis of habitat type which included mangrove mudflats, open mudflats and <b>rocky</b> <b>shores.</b> A total of 19 species belonging to 8 families and 15 genera were recorded.

40|$|The {{effect of}} sand is a poorly {{understood}} {{factor in the}} intertidal. Sand inundation has been hypothesised to increase species diversity in comparison to <b>rocky</b> <b>shores</b> by increasing habitat heterogeneity. However, previous studies contrast in their findings of fauna! species richness along sand inundated <b>rocky</b> <b>shores.</b> The present study sampled fauna! and algal species composition and diversity along three transects of varying levels of sand inundation at six sites around the Cape Peninsula. Similar species richness was found between sand inundated <b>rocky</b> <b>shores</b> and <b>rocky</b> <b>shores</b> within all sites sampled. A number of environmental variables were found to control species composition, primarily zonation. Species composition at Muizenberg differed from other sites sampled due to biogeographical distance. Differing species composition at Noordhoek was attributed to the site being on granite, {{in comparison to the}} Table Mountain Sandstone substrate of all other sites sampled. Despite these factors, species composition was similar at all sites sampled. The finding that sand affected <b>rocky</b> <b>shores</b> are as species rich as <b>rocky</b> <b>shores</b> of contrasts with those of previous studies, and emphasises the need for further research into the ecology of sand affected <b>rocky</b> <b>shores...</b>|$|R

30|$|Mauritius (20 ^∘ 10 'S, 57 ^∘ 30 'E), {{located in}} the south western Indian Ocean near the {{southern}} end of the Mascarene Ridge, has an approximated surface area of 1859 km^ 2 (Fig. 1). The island has an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of about 2.3 million km^ 2 (including approx. 400, 000 km^ 2 jointly managed with the Seychelles) that extends over the islands of Rodrigues, Agalega, Cargados Carajos shoals, Chagos Archipelago and Tromelin. Of volcanic origin, starting with the Breccia Series 10 – 7.8 million years (my) B.P., the geomorphological features of the island comprise an elevated central plateau (about 500 m above sea level) surrounded by a chain of mountains and some isolated peaks. The elevation of the terrain decreases gently from the central plateau towards the coastal edge. The coastline measures about 200 km long and is composed of different shore types (categorized as sandy <b>shores,</b> <b>rocky</b> <b>shores,</b> muddy shores, mixed shores, calcareous limestone shores, cliffs and coastal wetlands) whose landforms are related to the coastal geomorphologic features. The shoreline is ringed by fringing coral reefs which enclose a lagoon having an approximated area of 243 km^ 2 [11]. With an annual growth rate of about 2 mm, living coral reef formations resist destruction from sea action by constantly growing due to the preference for light and sediment-free waters [11].|$|R

40|$|Although sand {{deposits}} {{are present}} on many intertidal <b>rocky</b> <b>shores,</b> {{their effects on}} species richness, zonation and trophic structure have often been overlooked. This study {{is the first to}} recognise sand as an important abiotic factor on South African <b>rocky</b> <b>shores.</b> <b>Rocky</b> <b>shores</b> in the eastern Cape Province of South Africa are subject to extensive sand inundation and are composed of two hard substrata of differing topographies. Four sites on one substratum and six on the other were sampled quantitatively using quadrats. The biota were identified, counted and/ or weighed to provide a matrix of species biomass and numbers in separate zones. This matrix was then analysed using ordination and classification. A total of 321 species were identified which is more than local <b>rocky</b> or sandy <b>shores.</b> While the intermediate disturbance hypothesis would predict high species richness on these shores, it does not fully explain this richness nor the distribution of species assemblages. Habitat heterogeneity, including the dynamics of sand deposits, is strongly influenced by substratum topography and is the most important factor generating species richness. Abrasion by sand (sand scour) causes local reductions in richness but the presence of semi-permanent sand deposits allows habitation by psammophilic and sand-dependent species. As a result the biota of a sand inundated <b>rocky</b> <b>shore</b> includes both a full <b>rocky</b> <b>shore</b> and a large sandy beach component. Substratum topography controls patterns of sand deposition and retention and community analysis showed that samples were clustered primarily according to species richness and secondarily according to substratum type. Ordination of species identified an arc of species assemblages of decreasing levels of sand tolerance. These corresponded to sample groupings so that th assemblages found in various habitats were characterised by particular levels of sand tolerance. The presence of sand has a negative effect on the biomass of primary producers and filter feeders but a positive effect on the biomass of deposit feeders. Because sand is retained to different degrees in different zones, trophic structure varies between zones and to a lesser extent, between rock types. In general, however, the trophic structure of sand inundated <b>rocky</b> <b>shores</b> {{is similar to that of}} non-inundated shores...|$|R

40|$|Understanding the {{ecological}} role of artificial structures, such as seawalls, in shallow coastal waters {{is necessary in}} order to plan sound strategies of conservation and management of natural habitats. In Sydney Harbour (NSW, Australia), about 50 % of the foreshore is made of retaining seawalls This study evaluates the changes caused to natural assemblages of organisms by these structures, by comparing intertidal assemblages between seawalls and vertical <b>rocky</b> <b>shores.</b> The following hypotheses were tested: that assemblages on seawalls would differ from those on <b>rocky</b> <b>shores</b> at mid-, but not at low-shore levels; where assemblages differ between habitats, there would be differences in cover/abundances of widespread species; patterns would be consistent among locations and through time; the variability of assemblages at the scales of 10 s of cm and metres would differ between seawalls and <b>rocky</b> <b>shores</b> at mid- and low-shore levels. To test these hypotheses, assemblages on seawalls and <b>rocky</b> <b>shores</b> were sampled at three locations, at roughly 4 -monthly intervals, over a period of about 18 months. Results indicated that mid-shore assemblages on seawalls were different from those on <b>rocky</b> <b>shores,</b> but {{this was not the case}} at low-shore levels. Few taxa were unique to either habitat. Cover of common species of algae and sessile animals and abundances of mobile grazers were variable with few consistent patterns. Variability at the scales sampled differed between habitats and heights on the <b>shore.</b> Seawalls and <b>rocky</b> <b>shores,</b> in general, supported a similar suite of species, but patterns of abundance and variation differed among locations and from height to height in each habitat.

40|$|Sandy {{beaches in}} some areas of the São Sebastião Channel in southeastern Brazil have unremittingly {{undergone}} a variety of impacts, including the deposition of rock fragments in the intertidal region. Consequently, these environments support a rich fauna comprising both sandy beach and <b>rocky</b> <b>shore</b> organisms. Two <b>rocky</b> <b>shore</b> gastropods, Tegula viridula and Morula nodulosa, are particularly abundant in such environments. An evaluation of the use of microhabitats by these two species revealed that they occupy the available microhabitats in different proportions and the presence of one species is associated with the absence of the other. Morula nodulosa is randomly dispersed, occupying mostly areas with rock fragments covered with sediment and branching brown algae. Tegula viridula shows a clumped dispersion associated with the patchiness of the microhabitats used: the presence of encrusting green algae and absence of sediment and branching brown algae covering the rocks. These findings suggest T. viridula has a lower tolerance than M. nodulosa to sand inundation of the rocky fragments, a stochastic event common to the environment in question...|$|R

An increase in human activities in river basins may alter the natural riverine nutrients and carbon export to coastal ecosystems. Along a wide latitudinal range (32 ° 55 'S- 40 ° 10 'S), this study explores the role of climate and land use in determining the nutrient and carbon concentrations in the river mouth and fluxes to adjacent coastal areas. Between winter 2011 and fall 2012, we collected monthly samples in five river mouths in central southern Chile and at <b>rocky</b> <b>shore</b> sites affected by river plumes. Basins were characterized by different land uses and meteorological conditions along this latitudinal range. Water samples were collected for pH measurements, nutrients, dissolved organic and inorganic carbon, particulate organic carbon, and isotopic signatures (δ¹³C). Our results show a north-south gradient in concentrations of nutrients and carbon. The highest concentrations were observed in the Maipo basin, which presents the highest percentage of urban-industrial activities. Nutrients and carbon contributions, in most cases, were lowest in the southern Valdivia basin, which has the least human intervention and a greater percentage of vegetation. The Biobio River had the highest nutrient and carbon fluxes, in most cases, due to its high river discharge. Our results show the influence of river plume effects on carbon and nitrogen concentrations in river-influenced <b>rocky</b> <b>shore</b> sites. Moreover, our study suggests that land use might influence some parameters of carbonate system in rivers and river-influenced <b>rocky</b> <b>shore</b> environments.
