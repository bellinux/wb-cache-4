40|$|Binocular rivalry {{occurs when}} an {{observer}} looks at two different monocular images. One {{of the images}} is alternately suppressed, invisible, while the other is dominant, visible. Models of binocular rivalry hold adaptation responsible for these changes in visual consciousness. Alais et al. (2010, Current Biology) showed psychophysically that depth of rivalry suppression declines within an episode of suppression, consistent {{with the effects of}} adaptation. Our aim was to find a neural marker for this decline in suppression depth. We used electroencephalography (EEG) to search for this neural marker. We induced binocular rivalry with dichoptically orthogonal sine-wave gratings. Participants pressed keys to record their perception of orientation. On each trial, we changed one of the gratings to be the same as the other, either to the currently suppressed or to the currently dominant stimulus. On different trials, we made the change at an individually adjusted short time (about 200 ms), medium time (about 700 ms), or long time (about 1200 ms) after the participant signalled a new percept. We found the earliest neural correlate of suppression about 100 ms after the stimulus change, with invisible changes yielding a smaller positive deflection (P 1) than visible changes. The P 1 difference was pronounced for the short and medium times, and almost abolished for the long time. The decline from short and medium times to the long time is consistent with the expected reduction in suppression depth with time in the <b>suppression</b> <b>interval,</b> and consistent with the psychophysical results. We conclude that we have shown a neural correlate of the adaptation leading to changes in visibility during binocular rivalry...|$|E

To {{determine the extent of}} bilateral neural responses in awake animals, we recorded S 1 multi- and single-unit activity in head-immobilized rats while stimulating groups of 4 whiskers from the same column {{on both sides of the}} head. Results from these experiments confirm the widespread presence of single units responding to tactile stimuli on either side of the face in S 1 of awake animals. Quantification of bilateral integration by multiunits revealed both facilitative and suppressive integration of bilateral inputs. Varying the interval between left and right whisker stimuli between 0 and 120 ms showed the temporal integration of bilateral stimuli to be dominated on average by <b>suppression</b> at <b>intervals</b> around 30 ms, in agreement with comparable recordings in anesthetized animals. Contrary to the anesthetized data, in th...|$|R
40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at link. springer. comInterval protection or partial cell suppression was introduced in “M. Fischetti, J. -J. Salazar, Partial cell suppression: A new methodology for statistical disclosure control, Statistics and Computing, 13, 13 – 21, 2003 ” as a “linearization” of the difficult cell <b>suppression</b> problem. <b>Interval</b> protection replaces some cells by intervals containing the original cell value, unlike in cell suppression where the values are suppressed. Although the resulting optimization problem is still huge—as in cell suppression, it is linear, thus allowing the application of efficient procedures. In this work we present preliminary results with a prototype implementation of Benders decomposition for interval protection. Although the above seminal publication about partial cell suppression applied a similar methodology, our approach differs in two aspects: (i) {{the boundaries of the}} intervals are completely independent in our implementation, whereas the one of 2003 solved a simpler variant where boundaries must satisfy a certain ratio; (ii) our prototype is applied to a set of seven general and hierarchical tables, whereas only three two-dimensional tables were solved with the implementation of 2003.

40|$|Cross-sectional {{studies have}} shown a {{positive}} association between expres-sive suppression and depressive symptoms. These results have been inter-preted as reflecting the impact of emotion regulation efforts on depression. However, {{it is also possible}} that depression may alter emotion regulation tendencies.

30|$|The {{statistical}} {{results in}} Table[*] 1 {{show that the}} simulated spectral distributions of SOAEs in human ears lead to a variation between small adjacent intervals that does not differ significantly from that in the measured data. This result indicates that two factors may be sufficient to cause the observed phenomena: a stochastic occurrence of emission generators along the cochlea plus a graded probability of close-range suppression of an emitter by an adjacent stronger one. The large-scale group simulations (Figure[*] 3) further show that a simple linear increase of <b>suppression</b> probability for <b>intervals</b> from 95 to 55 Cent {{would be consistent with}} the measured data from high-multiple SOAEs. The physical basis of graded close-range suppression may lie in the tissue between OHC, such as the reticular lamina and the tectorial membrane. If the amount of tissue between two vibrating OHC decreases, the probability increases that the oscillator with the higher amplitude suppresses its neighbor.|$|R
40|$|Changes to fire regimes {{associated}} with European colonisation are implicated in declines in biodiversity and productivity in rangelands globally. However, for many areas there is incomplete knowledge of historical fire regimes and purported changes can become accepted wisdom with little empirical evidence. In the Mulga Lands of south-western Queensland, the dominant narrative implicates reduced fire frequency {{as a cause}} of woody vegetation thickening. We present a fire history of the Mulga Lands since pastoral exploration in the 1840 s based on a review of explorer and early pastoralist journals, newspaper articles, interviews with long-term landholders and collation of satellite imagery. Fires in mulga communities are infrequent and only occur after at least two years of above-average summer rainfall. The assumption of regular pre-pastoral fires is not supported by available evidence. Since pastoral settlement in the 1860 s, fire events affecting > 1000 km 2 have occurred seven times (1891 – 1892, 1904, 1918, 1950 – 1951, 1956 – 1957, 1976 – 1979 and 2011 – 2013), with only the 1950 s fires affecting a > 10 % of the total area of mulga-dominated vegetation. We argue that fire is limited by fuel loads, which are in turn limited by rainfall events occurring only a few times a century. Even in the absence of grazing and active fire <b>suppression</b> fire <b>intervals</b> would be extremely long, perhaps 30 – 50 years in relatively fire-prone communities and much longer throughout most of the region. Combined with quantitative studies of fire and tree and shrub population dynamics, detailed fire histories will allow for more informed and nuanced debates about the role of fire in rangelands subject to abrupt management upheavals...|$|R
40|$|Cell {{suppression}} {{has been}} a commonly used method at the Census Bureau and at other agencies for protecting sensitive cells in statistical tables whose cells contain magnitude data. In this method, the sensitivity of each cell depends {{on the distribution of}} the respondent values which are summed to form the cell value. Those cells determined to be sensitive are suppressed and then a cell suppression program is run to determine which additional cells (called secondary suppressions) need to be suppressed {{in order to protect the}} sensitive ones. In this study, we compare two ways of protecting sensitive cells and their effects on the suppression patterns, i. e., the set of secondary ones. These ways are (1) fixed interval protection and (2) sliding protection. In studies done over a decade ago by researchers at the University of Maryland, it was shown that sliding protection often leads to fewer secondary <b>suppressions</b> than fixed <b>interval</b> protection. Here we show that this result does not hold when the cell suppression program incorporates the following assumption: if v is any respondent value, then any table user knows, from publicly available information, that the value lies in the interval [0, 2 *v]. In other words, respondent values are known by interested parties to within 100 % of their actual value...|$|R
40|$|SummaryBackgroundUnderstanding {{speech in}} the {{presence}} of background noise often becomes increasingly difficult with age. These age-related speech processing deficits reflect impairments in temporal acuity. Gap detection is a model for temporal acuity in speech processing in which a gap inserted in white noise acts as a cue that attenuates subsequent startle responses. Lesion studies have shown that auditory cortex is necessary for the detection of brief gaps, and auditory cortical neurons respond {{to the end of the}} gap with a characteristic burst of spikes called the gap termination response (GTR). However, it remains unknown whether and how the GTR plays a causal role in gap detection. We tested this by optogenetically suppressing the activity of somatostatin- or parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory interneurons, or CaMKII-expressing excitatory neurons, in auditory cortex of behaving mice during specific epochs of a gap detection protocol. ResultsSuppressing interneuron activity during the postgap interval enhanced gap detection. Suppressing excitatory cells during this interval attenuated gap detection. Suppressing activity preceding the gap had the opposite behavioral effects, whereas prolonged <b>suppression</b> across both <b>intervals</b> had no effect on gap detection. ConclusionsIn addition to confirming cortical involvement, we demonstrate here for the first time a causal relationship between postgap neural activity and perceptual gap detection. Furthermore, our results suggest that gap detection involves an ongoing comparison of pre- and postgap spiking activity. Finally, we propose a simple yet biologically plausible neural circuit that reproduces each of these neural and behavioral results...|$|R
40|$|To study {{integration}} of converging sensory inputs on single cortical neurons, we performed intracellular recordings in vivo in the barrel cortex of the barbiturate-anesthetized rat. We deflected the principal whisker (PW) for each cell either alone or preceded (at 20, 50, and 100 msec) by the deflection {{of a small}} number of remote whiskers (RWs) far from the PW. The synaptic responses to both the PW and the RW were similar qualitatively and consisted of excitation followed by inhibition that comprised an early and a late component. The RW response was of smaller amplitude and more often subthreshold for action potential generation. The main effect of the RW deflection was a suppression of the subsequent response to the PW that was most pronounced at the 20 msec interval and decreased progressively at the 50 and 100 msec <b>intervals.</b> <b>Suppression</b> of the spike output of the cell was not caused by hyperpolarization (subtractive inhibition) but by a reduction in the EPSP amplitude (divisive inhibition), resulting in a highly sublinear summation of the two responses. The small decrease in input resistance caused by the RW responses is not consistent with synaptic shunting as the main cause of the reduction of the EPSP amplitude. Instead, our results suggest that suppression results from a decrease in the amount of synaptic input triggered by the PW, particularly the early excitation. We suggest that this process involves a reduction in reverberant granular cell excitation that is induced by PW deflection.

As plantas foram cultivadas em potes com suprimento hídrico normal, até os 15 dias após o plantio, quando houve diferenciação do tratamento hídrico. Para um grupo de plantas, as regas continuaram normalmente, enquanto para outro foram suspensas por 45 dias e, após este período, procedeu-se à reirrigação. A cada 15 dias e após 48 h da irrigação, foram avaliados o potencial da água da folha (&# 968;w), a transpiração (E) e a resistência difusiva (Rs) em folhas adultas completamente expandidas, situadas no terço {{superior}} da haste principal. Observaram-se diferenças entre as cultivares nas características de tolerância ao estresse hídrico. A cv.

40|$|Changing disturbance-climate {{interactions}} {{will drive}} shifts in plant communities: these effects are not adequately quantified by environmental niche models {{used to predict}} future species distributions. We quantified the effects of more frequent fire and lower rainfall - as projected to occur under a warming and drying climate - on population responses of shrub species in biodiverse Mediterranean-climate type shrublands near Eneabba, southwestern Australia. Using experimental fires, we measured the density of all shrub species for four dominant plant functional groups (resprouter/non-sprouter × serotinous/soil seed bank) before and after fire in 33 shrubland sites, covering four post-fire rainfall years and fire intervals from 3 - 24 years. Generalized linear mixed effects models were used to test our a priori hypotheses of rainfall, fire interval and plant functional type effects on post-fire survival and recruitment. At shortened fire intervals, species solely dependent on seedling recruitment for persistence were more vulnerable to local extinction than were species with both seedling recruitment and vegetative regrowth. Nevertheless, seedling recruitment was essential for population maintenance of resprouting species. Serotinous species were less resilient than soil seed storage species regardless of regeneration mode. Critically, in relation to changing climate, a 20 % reduction in post-fire winter rainfall (essential for seedling recruitment) is predicted to increase the minimum inter-fire interval required for self-replacement by 50 %, placing many species at risk of decline. Synthesis. Our results highlight the potentially deleterious biodiversity impacts of climate and fire regime change, and underscore weaknesses inherent in studies considering single impact factors in isolation. In fire-prone ecosystems characterized by a projected warming and drying climate, and increasing fire hazard, adaptive approaches to fire management may need to include heightened wildfire <b>suppression</b> and lengthened <b>intervals</b> for prescribed fire to best support the in situ persistence of perennial plant species and of plant biodiversity. This conclusion {{is at odds with}} the view that more managed fire may be needed to mitigate wildfire risk as climate warms...|$|R
