5|$|When Brian advises Stewie to “wait and see” {{whether or}} not he has cancer, Stewie says “Jim Henson had a wait and see attitude, and look what {{happened}} to him. Now we’ve got wrong-sounding Muppets,” a reference to Henson’s deadly Streptococcus pneumoniae infection that was discovered too late which led to his death in 1990. The scene then cuts to Kermit the Frog and the Swedish Chef in a dialogue sequence, with much different voice tones. The two would later appear {{at the end of the}} show, discussing the preceding events, when Fozzie Bear walks in, and <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> deep voice (supplied by actor Michael Clarke Duncan): “Wocka wocka.

25|$|In August 1703, {{he again}} {{settled in the}} Netherlands, in the air of which he seems, like Locke, to have had great faith. At Rotterdam he lived, he <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> letter to his steward Wheelock, {{at the rate of}} less than £200 a year, and yet had much to dispose of and spend beyond {{convenient}} living. He returned to England, much improved in health, in August 1704. Although he had received immediate benefit from his stay abroad, he was showing symptoms of consumption, and gradually became a confirmed invalid. His occupations were now almost exclusively literary, and from this time forward he was engaged in writing, completing or revising the treatises which were afterwards included in the Characteristics. He continued, however, to take a warm interest in politics, both home and foreign, and especially in the war against France, of which he was an enthusiastic supporter.|$|E
500|$|Until the 1990s, {{literary}} critic William Zinsser says, memoir writers tended to conceal their most personal and embarrassing memories. [...] In the 1970s Satin {{wrote a book}} revealing many such memories as a neopacifist activist during the years 1964–66, Confessions of a Young Exile, published by Gage, a Toronto publishing house soon to merge with Macmillan of Canada. [...] Confessions is [...] "a remarkable exercise in self-exposure", playwright John Lazarus <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> review.

The text by an anonymous author, who possibly supplied texts {{of two of the}} Christmas cantatas as well, combines the prescribed readings for the feast day, the prophecy from the Book of Isaiah and the gospel of Matthew about the Wise Men from the East. The librettist begins with a quotation from the prophecy, comments it by a stanza of the early anonymous Christmas carol [...] "", <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sequence of recitatives and arias that the prophecy was fulfilled in Bethlehem, concluding that the Christian should bring his heart as a gift.

500|$|In 1940 Tunis {{received}} $200 {{from his}} publisher {{to visit the}} Dodgers' spring training camp in Clearwater, Florida. He then began work on his first baseball novel. The Kid from Tomkinsville became {{the first in a}} series of eight books about the Brooklyn Dodgers. In it, Tunis introduced rookie pitcher Roy Tucker and his teammates: [...] "Bones" [...] Hathaway, [...] "Razzle" [...] Nugent and [...] "Fat Stuff" [...] Foster. Tunis <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> note at the beginning of the book that [...] "all the characters in this book were drawn from real life." [...] Though his papers only list Tucker as [...] "Number 36", they do say that, among others, [...] "Gabby" [...] Gus was based on Leo Durocher and Tucker's Rabbi was inspired by Luke Sewell. Kirkus gave it another starred review, saying it [...] "struck a new note". Tucker's story continues in 1941's World Series.|$|E
500|$|Spears' {{cover of}} [...] "My Prerogative" [...] is musically {{different}} {{from its original}} version, with the bass and new jack swing sound replaced with a synthpop sound, synthesizers and elements typical of Bloodshy & Avant productions. It was noted by Christy Lemire of msnbc.com that the cover also contains elements of Bollywood music. At {{the beginning of the}} song, Spears <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> breathy voice the lines [...] "People can take everything away from you / But they can never take away your truth / But the question is, can you handle mine?". The rest of the lyrics do not deviate much from the original version, instead they are changed to fit a woman's perspective. Jennifer Vineyard of MTV commented the cover could be interpreted as a statement on Spears's life and the media reaction to some of her decisions at the time, including her engagement to American dancer Kevin Federline.|$|E

500|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{comes into}} the office, wearing shabby clothing, and walks {{straight}} into manager Nellie Bertram's (Catherine Tate) office and pleads for a job. She eventually caves and makes him janitor for the day. Later, Andy <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> talking head interview that he has actually convinced former CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) to buy Dunder Mifflin from Sabre and then make him the regional manager yet again; Andy is wearing the shabby clothing and making himself smell of alcohol {{in order to make}} everyone believe that he is doing poorly. [...] Andy becomes very dependent on David arriving at the office until Andy calls him to say that he cannot make it until the next Friday. Andy then announces the plan and upon hearing this everyone assumes that Andy's conversations with David are hallucinations because none of them have seen Andy talking with David. However, David surprisingly shows up to the office and assures everyone that he is indeed buying Dunder Mifflin from Sabre with the $20 million that he got from selling a toy-vacuum invention to the United States Military. He also reveals that Jo Bennett is planning on liquidating the rest of Sabre. Upon hearing this news, Sabre CEO Robert California (James Spader) approaches David in an oddly excitable tone, introducing himself as [...] "Bob Kazamakis" [...] and takes him to the conference room to negotiate. Meanwhile, when Andy is reinstated as manager, Nellie begs him by reciting Shakespeare's quality of mercy quote from The Merchant of Venice. Out of pity, Andy gives Nellie a new job as special projects manager. Robert later tells the office that he will be leaving {{for the next three years}} and going to [...] "help" [...] undereducated Eastern European high school gymnasts with matching funds of one million dollars, which he convinces David to donate, disgusting the rest of the office. He then exits the office once and for all by giving Andy a kiss, possibly as a symbol of his power being regained, puts his arm around Andy and says to the office, [...] "It's been a great year." ...|$|E

2500|$|When John F. Kennedy, a Catholic, ran for President in 1960, Rev.

[...] as a chapter {{in one of his}} Prophecies for the Times books, published in the summer of 1960, saying: [...] "Each person has the right to their own religious belief. This is one of our precious freedoms and every denomination should have the right in every country to operate and not be hindered. A Roman Catholic is a member of an ecclesiastical system ... that demands the first allegiance of every true member ... and <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> conflict between church and state, the church must prevail." [...] A Roman Catholic President, he said, would be subject to the absolute authority of the Pope according to church teachings. As archived in the Presidential Campaign Papers at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, Kennedy's campaign team had Pastor Lowman's book and the candidate responded to the controversy by declaring his belief in {{the separation of church and}} state.|$|E
2500|$|Gloria in Excelsis. Toward {{the end of}} the Kyrie, {{the sacred}} ministers walk (still staying in a line) {{to the center of the}} altar.

The three sacred ministers genuflect at the foot of the altar steps, then ascend and form a line. (The deacon and subdeacon usually lift the ends of the celebrant's alb whenever they ascend the steps together, and place their closest hand under his elbows when they descend together.) The celebrant intones, i.e. sings the first few words of, the Gloria, after which the choir sings the rest and the deacon and subdeacon ascend the steps to stand at either side of the celebrant, while he <b>says</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> low voice the remainder of the Gloria independently of the choir. When they are finished they remain in this position until the singing is nearly done or, if it is a long musical setting, they may go down and sit (first genuflecting), as mentioned above at the Kyrie.
