5|$|After a <b>slow</b> <b>start,</b> {{in early}} 1942, Cascade {{began to take}} effect. As early as May, Axis {{intelligence}} began to overestimate Allied strength by nearly 30%.

By 1944, when the operation was superseded, it had completely fooled the enemy. Cascade was a major success for Clarke; it supported most of the subsequent major deceptions for the remainder of the war (by providing established fictional units) and proved that deception on a grand scale was a realistic strategy.|$|E
