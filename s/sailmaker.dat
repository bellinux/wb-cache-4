The new Parish Church was completed in 1748 with a mix of perpendicular Gothic and Classical Revival styles. All that remains of the Medieval church is the west tower, 90 feet high, and housing eight bells. A monument to Richard Rollett, master <b>sailmaker</b> on Captain James Cook's second voyage, is located in the porch.|$|E

At about 4;00 p.m., {{the three men}} went into the store room to procure grog. Captain Frazer pulled the plug from a cask, thinking it contained molasses, but it contained rum, whicb began to spill into the room. The men struck matches {{to find their way}} in the darkness, and one of the matches fell onto the spilled onto the spilled rum, which caught fire. The fire spread quickly; Hampshire and Barron escaped, but Frazer was trapped in the store room and died in the fire. Iserbrooke was scuttled in the harbor in an attempt to control the fire, but this was only partly successful, and the portion of the ship above water level continued to burn for some time until the local fire department could extinguish. Captain Frazer′s remains eventually were recovered after the ship was pumped out and raised early in 1879. Iserbrook′s damaged hulk remained afloat in the harbor until 30 January 1880, when it sank again. Deemed not worth further salvage efforts in July 1880, the wreck was destroyed with explosives in October 1880.|$|E

500|$|Driven by {{the needs}} of the fishing and {{commercial}} sailing industry, in 1795 Arbroath-based <b>sailmaker</b> Francis Webster Ltd had perfected the art of adding linseed oil to flax sails, creating an oiled flax. This developed in the late-19th century into waxed cotton, which drove Arbroath as a manufacturing centre, until the early 1970s manufacturing began to decline. A major employer, Keith & Blackman, closed in 1985 and Giddings and Lewis-Fraser wound down its operations at about the same time, with the entire plant eventually demolished {{to make way for a}} Safeway (now Morrisons) supermarket. Alps Electric Co. was a large employer in Arbroath from 1990 to 2001, employing 180 staff. Following the closure of the plant, all 180 staff were made redundant ...|$|E

Nelson's assistant William Brown was a former midshipman who had seen naval action against the French. Banks also helped to secure the official midshipmen's berths for two of his protégés, Thomas Hayward and John Hallett. Overall, Bountys crew was relatively youthful, the majority being under 30; {{at the time of}} departure, Bligh was 33 years old. Among the older crew members were the 39-year-old Peckover, who had sailed on all three of Cook's voyages, and Lawrence Lebogue, a year older and formerly <b>sailmaker</b> on the Britannia. The youngest aboard were Hallett and Heywood, both 15 when they left England.|$|E

The distinction between prisoner of war and slave is not clear-cut, but Jewitt lost his liberty and had to work for Maquinna. Jewitt uses the word [...] "slave" [...] to describe his position and asserts that Maquinna had about 50 others, consisting of half his household. Thompson (the <b>sailmaker)</b> and Jewitt were taunted, out of Maquinna's hearing, as [...] "white slaves", with explosive results, including a death.|$|E

At a signal, the Nootka attacked, and all but two of the white men were killed. Jewitt suffered a serious head injury but his life was saved by Maquinna, who saw how useful it would be to have an armourer to repair weapons. (One other man—the Boston's <b>sailmaker,</b> John Thompson—was in hiding until the next day, when Jewitt pretended to be his son and begged Maquinna to spare his [...] "father".) Maquinna asked Jewitt if he would be his slave and Jewitt assented under duress, as the alternative was immediate death (p.31). This was the beginning of his three years among the Nootka.|$|E

2500|$|Harriet Davy Forten, born in Philadelphia in 1810, was one {{of eight}} {{children}} of James Forten and Charlotte Vandine Forten, who lived at 92 Lombard Street. James Forten was a wealthy inventor, businessman and abolitionist who was born free. Forten, born in 1766, was a powder boy and was taken prisoner from the Royal Lewis during the Revolutionary War. Her father was given a start in business by Robert Bridges, a white <b>sailmaker.</b> Harriet was named for one of Bridge's daughters. The Fortens, the most well-known black family in the city, were noted for their gentility and hospitality. William Lloyd Garrison wrote of the family [...] "who have few superiors in refinement, in moral worth, in all that makes the human character worthy of admiration and praise."

2500|$|The Dutch {{style was}} {{exported}} to other nations by various artists who emigrated, {{as well as}} mere emulation by foreign artists. [...] The most important emigrants were the leading Amsterdam marine artists, {{the father and son}} Willem van de Velde. [...] Having spent decades chronicling Dutch naval victories over the English, {{after the collapse of the}} art market in the disastrous rampjaar of 1672, they accepted an invitation from the English court to move to London, and spent the rest of their lives painting the wars from the other side. [...] Artists loosely said to have [...] "followed" [...] their style include Isaac <b>Sailmaker,</b> although he was a much earlier Dutch emigrant who had preceded their arrival in England by at least 20 years, and whose style is very different from theirs; as well as Peter Monamy, whose style derives from numerous marine painters besides the van de Veldes, such as Nooms, Peeters and Bakhuizen; and several others, such as Thomas Baston and the Vale brothers, who painted in the native English tradition.|$|E

The vessel's Letter of Marque (from the US Government), Registry Certificate and Muster Roll were found on board and are now held by the UK National Archives. These name Ordronaux {{as one of the}} owners and Captain Nicholas Millin as master of the vessel since 12 December 1814. These records suggest that Ordronaux was not on board when Prince de Neufchatel was captured, and cannot be held responsible for its loss.

2500|$|Meigs {{intended}} for an awning of sorts {{to cover the}} amphitheater bowl to provide protection from hot sun or rain. Canvas awnings (whose description, method of erection, and use are not known) were employed on Decoration Day in 1874, but came loose {{in the wind and}} were greatly disliked by people attending the ceremonies. A second set of awnings were constructed for use in time for the 1875 Decoration Day. Manufactured by M.G. Copeland (who both cut and fit them to the pergola), these blue-and-white striped awnings (made of an unidentified material) were attached to the trellis above the dais and sections of the trellis around the amphitheater. But these, too, proved difficult to control in wind, which blew them around when not properly tied down. The striped awnings were replaced in 1877 by a tent-like canopy. Manufactured by <b>sailmaker</b> Charles Lawrence of Philadelphia, the new covering was made of duck canvas and covered both the dais and the amphitheater's grassy bowl. Designed by Meigs, this tent-like structure was supported by two poles erected inside the ellipse. [...] Long ropes passed over and through the trellises and were attached to stakes driven into the earth outside the amphitheater. Lawrence supplied the tent, while the federal government supplied the rope, stakes, and poles. The canopy was first used on Decoration Day 1878, and on many occasions thereafter.|$|E
