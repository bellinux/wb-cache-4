5|$|On 4 November 2010, Stabæk Holding <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{were near}} a bankruptcy, {{and that they}} {{intended}} to throw out Stabæk as a tenant, remove the turf and instead use the venue exclusively for events. Chair Diderik Schnitler in Stabæk Holding stated that the business model was not sustainable. The football schedule was not made until early in the year, while in the event business, bookings were common {{one to two years}} in advance. It was therefore difficult to secure lucrative events, as large parts of the year had to be held in reserve in case the venue was needed for yet-to-be scheduled matches. The holding company <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might have to file for bankruptcy. Stabæk Fotball <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had a 40-year contract to use the venue.|$|E

5|$|In July, {{the master}} plan {{was passed by}} the Council of State. On 10 December 1992, Parliament {{approved}} advanced payment of tolls on the ferry, which were made effective from 1 January 1993. Ticket prices increased with between NOK10 and 12. This resulted in protests from the ferry employees who <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> would have to collect the tolls which would remove their jobs; Norwegian Seafarers' Union representatives <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> considered suing the state. Work on the development plan started in 1992. It included safety and environmental improvements which increased the project's cost by NOK200 million.

5|$|In November, Lyn <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{wanted to}} {{purchases}} the shares in Ullevaal from NFF, who <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were now worth NOK10 million. NFF also raised questions {{if it was}} actually Lyn or the newly created limited company who were actually going to buy the shares. NFF <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were opposed to anyone but the federation and clubs owning the national stadium {{and that they were}} opposed to private investors. The federation hoped to use the high incomes generated from the recent success of the national team, including from participation in the 1994 FIFA World Cup, to allow the stadium company to charge high rent for the international matches and Cup Finals, thus quickly eliminating the stadium's debt. NFF felt it was unfair that they were in practice subsidizing Lyn by not having similar rent increases for the club, and that this should be reflected in the share value. In March 1994, Lyn sued NFF for the right to purchase the shares for NOK4.4 million plus interest.|$|E

5|$|According to the Mexican authorities, {{the murder}} plot was {{possibly}} {{carried out with}} the collaboration of the Tijuana Cartel because no security measures were taken during the party and because the entrances were {{open to the public}} (when they are usually closed for private events).

Out of the 80 to 100 attendees, only 20 of them stayed, many of them family members and employees of the banquet hall. When the authorities interrogated those who stayed and asked them whether they had recognized the assassin or any other physical features, none of them were able to give any details. Some <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did not even pay attention to the clown when he entered the crime scene, while others <b>stated</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did not even recall exactly what the clown was wearing, remembering only that the assassin was wearing a blue-stripped or purple shirt, a multicolored wig, and a red clown nose.|$|E
