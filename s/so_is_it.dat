500|$|Raoul Berger, in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, disagrees; {{the words}} of the statute were clear, and the only {{application}} that it could have was unjust. Statutory interpretation allows for the ignoring of unjust extraneous meanings, but what Coke did was nullify the statute as a whole, along with its main intention. John V. Orth, writing in the Constitutional Commentary, concurs: [...] "If that were so, why did they not say <b>so?</b> <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> likely that the royal judges, confronting a case involving a statute that had necessarily passed both houses of parliament and received the royal assent, would lightly use the word 'void'?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Just as it {{is crazy}} to squander in a few decades much of the rich {{biological}} diversity that has evolved over billions of years, <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> equally crazy to permit the disappearance of much of human cultural diversity, which has evolved in a somewhat analogous way over many {{tens of thousands of}} years… The erosion of local cultural patterns around the world is not, however, entirely or even principally the result of contact with the universalizing effect of scientific enlightenment. Popular culture is in most cases far more effective at erasing distinctions between one place or society and another. Blue jeans, fast food, rock music, and American television serials have been sweeping the world for years. (1994: 338-343) ...|$|E
2500|$|Rab at Sura and Mar Samuel at Nehardea {{established}} the intellectual independence of Babylonian Jewry. Young men {{taking up the}} study of the Law there were no longer obliged to go to Palestine, since they had the foremost teachers at home. Babylon now came to be regarded, in a sense, as a second Holy Land. Samuel taught, [...] "As it is forbidden to migrate from Palestine to Babylon, <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> forbidden to migrate from Babylon to other countries" [...] (Ket. 111a). After Rab's death no new director was elected, and Rab's greatest pupil, R. Huna, who became president of the court of Sura, subordinated himself to Mar Samuel in every respect, asking his decision in every difficult religio-legal question (Giṭ. 66b, 89b; comp. Sanh. 17b; Tos. ib., s.v., the phrase [...] "be Rab" [...] referring to R. Huna).|$|E

In the article [...] "The Protestant Interest" [...] he pointed to the efforts of the Whig leaders to win support in Ireland by the promise of {{gratuity}} and places. [...] "But, Protestants of Ireland, shall it be <b>so?</b> <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> not time for all to rise above such vile influences as these? Does not our national interest, our national honour (for, after all, we are a nation), demand that we spurn the mean practice of both these foreign factions! that we shuffle off the coil of filthy place-hunting politics, that has kept us so long grovelling in the dust!... Ah! if you would hearken to us – and a hope dawns upon us that you will – if the Protestant magnates of the land would even now place themselves at the head of our national Confederacy, and, in this inter-regnum of foreign rule, would meet us as brothers." ...|$|E

"This {{national}} {{characteristic of}} the English to shout: 'Help, they are killing us!' when nobody even thinks of touching them, is disgusting… But if this trait is notable even in England, how much more <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> in India? Here suspicion has become a monomania. Anglo-Indians see Russian spies even in their own shoes, and this drives them to madness… They watch every new arrival from one province to another, even should he be an Englishman. People have been deprived not only of every weapon, but of all knives and axes. The peasant can hardly chop his wood, or protect himself from a tiger. But the English are still afraid. It is true that here there are but 60,000 of them, while the native population numbers 245 million. And their system which they took over from successful animal-tamers, is good only until the animal senses his tamer is fearful in his turn… Then his hour has come! At all events, such a manifestation of chronic fear merely admits a recognition of one's own weakness." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reading [...] “If a woman conceives,” Rabbi Levi {{said three}} things: [...] It is {{only natural that}} if a person has given into another’s keeping an ounce of silver in private, and the latter returns a pound of gold in public, the former will surely be {{grateful}} to the latter; and <b>so</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> with God. [...] Human beings entrust to God a drop of fluid in privacy, and God openly returns to them completed and perfected human beings. [...] Rabbi Levi said a second thing: [...] It is natural that, {{if a person is}} confined without attention to a chamber, and someone comes and kindles a light for the person there, the former should feel gratitude towards the latter. [...] So too is it with God. [...] When the embryo is in its mother’s womb, God causes a light to shine for it there with which it can see {{from one end of the}} world to the other. [...] Rabbi Levi said a third thing: [...] It is natural that, if a person is confined without attention to a chamber, and someone comes and releases the person and takes the person out from there, the former should feel gratitude to the latter. [...] Even so when the embryo is in its mother’s womb, God comes and releases it and brings it forth into the world.|$|E
