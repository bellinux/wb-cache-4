40|$|In 1934, Max Born and Leopold Infeld {{suggested}} {{and developed}} a nonlinear modification of Maxwell electrodynamics, in which the electrostatic self-energy of an electron was a finite value. In this paper, after a brief introduction to Lagrangian formulation of Born-Infeld electrodynamics with an external source, the explicit forms of Gauss's law and the electrostatic energy density in Born-Infeld theory are obtained. The capacitance and the <b>stored</b> <b>electrostatic</b> <b>energy</b> for a parallel-plate and spherical capacitors are computed {{in the framework of}} Born-Infeld electrostatics. We show that the usual relations U= 1 / 2 C__Maxwell(ϕ) ^ 2 and U=q^ 2 / 2 C__Maxwell are not valid for a capacitor in Born-Infeld electrostatics. Numerical estimations in this research show that the nonlinear corrections to the capacitance and the <b>stored</b> <b>electrostatic</b> <b>energy</b> for a capacitor in Born-Infeld electrostatics are considerable when the potential difference between the plates of a capacitor is very large.

A time-varying breakdown probability is obtained by applying a constant field stress to a statistically {{sufficient number of}} MOS capacitors.

40|$|More than 80 years ago, Born-Infeld electrodynamics was {{proposed}} {{in order to}} remove the point charge singularity in Maxwell electrodynamics. In this work, after a brief introduction to Lagrangian formulation of Abelian Born-Infeld model {{in the presence of}} an external source, we obtain the explicit forms of Gauss’s law and the energy density of an electrostatic field for Born-Infeld electrostatics. The electric field and the <b>stored</b> <b>electrostatic</b> <b>energy</b> per unit length for an infinite charged line and an infinitely long cylinder in Born-Infeld electrostatics are calculated. Numerical estimations in this paper show that the nonlinear corrections to Maxwell electrodynamics are considerable only for strong electric fields. We present an action functional for Abelian Born-Infeld model with an auxiliary scalar field in the presence of an external source. This action functional is a generalization of the action functional which was presented by Tseytlin in his studies on low energy dynamics of D-branes (Nucl. Phys. B 469, 51 (1996); Int. J. Mod. Phys.

40|$|There are {{striking}} phenomenological similarities between Fast Radio Bursts and lightning in the Earth's and planetary atmospheres. Both have very low duty factors, ≲ 10 ^- 8 [...] 10 ^- 5 for FRB and (very roughly) ∼ 10 ^- 4 {{for the main}} return strokes in an active thundercloud. Lightning occurs in an electrified insulating atmosphere when a conducting path is created by and permits current flow. FRB may occur in neutron star magnetospheres whose plasma {{is believed to be}} divided by vacuum gaps. Vacuum is a perfect insulator unless electric fields are sufficient for electron-positron pair production by curvature radiation, a high-energy analogue of electrostatic breakdown in an insulating gas.

40|$|We {{would like}} to point out here that {{although}} the idea expressed in the above mentioned paper [1] that the bare surface of a hot strange star may be a strong source of e + e − pairs of luminosity L e ± ∼ 3 × 10 51 ergs s − 1 for a duration of ∼ 10 s appears to be novel and exciting, it is, unfortunately unlikely to work because of several reasons. It is true that, it has already been hypothesesized by previous authors [2] that the bare surface of a strange star may be endowded with a superstrong electrostatic field of magnitude E ∼ 5 × 10 17 V cm − 1 ∼ 1. 5 × 10 13 statvolt cm − 1. Although such estimates, in general, could be fairly uncertain, let us momentarily assume that there is indeed such a field {{on the surface of the}} strange star over a height of ∆R ∼ 10 − 10 cm. As correctly envisaged in ref. 1, such a strong value of E>> Ecr = 1. 3 × 10 16 V cm − 1 is likely to convert the virtual pairs of the QED vacuum into real ones, i. e, create real e + e − pairs. For the sake of illustration, let us consider the region of the electric field as a parallel plate capacitor where the electrons comprise the negatively charged plate sitting on top of the positively charged stellar surface. If the number of electrons on the top plate is Ne, the vacuum discharge will be quenched after the generation of Ne real pairs- the Ne positrons thus created will move upward and tend to neutralize the preexisting negative charge whereas the freshly produced Ne electrons will move downward to neutralize the stellar surface and eventually the field would cease to exist. The maximum value of the total energy liberated by the discharge of the capacitor, in the form of pairs and photons, would be the <b>stored</b> <b>electrostatic</b> <b>energy</b> of the capacitor...|$|E
40|$|In {{a lot of}} oxide materials, when {{irradiated}} with high-energy heavy ions, continuous linear defects {{are produced}} along the ion paths. The defect production is attributed to the highdensity electronic excitation. The electronic stopping power, Se, has been considered as a parameter that determines the electronic excitation effects [1][2][3]. However, in some ionirradiated oxide materials such as Y 3 Fe 5 O 12, although the electronic stopping power is the same, larger electronic excitation effects have been found for irradiation with slower ions (v ≤ 2. 6 x 10 9 cm/s) than with faster ions [4]. This velocity dependence has been often called “velocity effect”. The electronic stopping power {{can be divided into}} two parts: the energy that is carried as the kinetic energy of secondary electrons and the energy that is <b>stored</b> as the <b>electrostatic</b> <b>energy</b> of target atoms ionized by passing ions.

40|$|Prediction and {{analysis}} of types of protein-protein interactions (PPI) is an important problem in molecular biology because of its key role in many biological processes in living cells. In this thesis, I propose a model called PPIEE (Protein-protein interaction using <b>electrostatic</b> <b>energies)</b> to predict and analyze protein interaction types using <b>electrostatic</b> <b>energies</b> as properties to distinguish between these types of interactions.
