5|$|Born February 26, 1957, in New York, New York, Mullen {{grew up in}} the Hell's Kitchen {{neighborhood}} of Manhattan when it was controlled by the Gambino crime family. It was a rough neighborhood; Mullen later <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of the people he grew up with fell into gangs and drug use, and several died before turning 21. He has three brothers, Ken, Tom Jr. and Brian, and a sister, Debbie.|$|E
5|$|On Speechless, Frith {{continued}} his exploration of world folk and dance music {{that he had}} begun on Gravity, but unlike Gravity, Speechless included extensive use of found sounds and field recordings. Frith <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of the tapes were made while walking the streets of New York City, and include street fairs and demonstrations. Recordings were also made while visiting friends: the title song's rhythm track is provided by a malfunctioning water pipe in Tim Hodgkinson's kitchen.|$|E
5|$|At the 2004 Square Enix E3 Press conference, {{producer}} Shinji Hashimoto <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> {{mysteries of}} the first game would be answered. Square Enix launched the official Japanese website in May 2005, followed by the English website in December 2005. The websites featured videos and information regarding characters and worlds. Commercials were aired in Japan which highlighted the numerous Disney characters in the game. Although the game was announced in September 2003, a release date for the game was not set until two years later. Nomura admitted that the game was announced too early and information regarding the game was not released until a debut period was in sight.|$|E

5|$|IGN {{said that}} the {{difference}} between character classes such as Thief and Jew were disappointingly minimal, offering little variety or incentive to replay as another class. IGN also said some missions and side quests were tedious, and were elevated by their setting rather than their quality, while the reviewer thought the environmental puzzles were a clever option for avoiding combat and were rare enough to be enjoyable when available. However, GameSpot said the puzzles felt scripted and simple. Reviewers <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of the gameplay functions and controls were poorly explained, making them difficult to activate; others were critical of excessive loading times upon entering new locations and slow menus such as the Facebook panel.|$|E
5|$|Mustaine is the band's primary songwriter. He {{develops}} songs {{starting with}} a particular riff that, with modifications, becomes {{the central part of}} the song. He has said that song fragments are composed separately, and then the band makes a compact structure from them. Drummer Shawn Drover stated that Mustaine had saved many riffs over the years and that some recent material is based on those demo recordings. Ellefson stated that the band constantly creates new material, and that making a recording begins with exchanging ideas after which the band enters the studio and discusses the concept, direction, artwork, and song titles. The lyrics are usually written after the music is arranged. Discussing the band's lyrics, Mustaine <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of the themes are derived from literature, such as the novels of George Orwell.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann's {{results have}} been viewed as a special case of linear programming, where von Neumann's model uses only nonnegative matrices. The study of von Neumann's model of an {{expanding}} economy continues to interest mathematical economists with interests in computational economics. This paper {{has been called the}} greatest paper in mathematical economics by several authors, who recognized its introduction of fixed-point theorems, linear inequalities, complementary slackness, and saddlepoint duality. In the proceedings of a conference on von Neumann's growth model, Paul Samuelson <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> mathematicians had developed methods useful to economists, but that von Neumann was unique in having made significant contributions to economic theory itself.|$|E

5000|$|In psychotherapy, the transtheoretical model posits five {{stages of}} {{intentional}} change (Precontemplation-Contemplation-Preparation-Action-Maintenance). These stages were initially conceived as linear, but John C.

5|$|Denise Wong, the Calgarian {{actor who}} portrayed Number 18 in the premiere, {{said that the}} play was about the human condition. Evelyn Chew, the Vancouverite actor {{who took over the}} role for the 2012 tour, said that the play is intense because it unabashedly deals with human trafficking, and that builds in {{intensity}} to its climax. Sienna Howell-Holden, who played Mama in the premiere and the 2012 tour, <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> audience members had not been previously familiar with 21st-century human trafficking. The character of Mama calls {{attention to the fact that}} poverty in the Third World fuels sex trafficking. Stephen Waldschmidt said he hoped that the play will educate Canadians about human trafficking and motivate them to act on what they learn, thereby turning them into anti-sexual slavery activists. He also said he hoped that the play will put a face on the million women and children sold into sexual slavery each year worldwide. Because of the play's heavy themes, producers of the first performances issued an advisory for parents. Waldschmidt also stressed the amount of action in the play and said that, if the play was a film, it would receive a PG-13 rating and would be billed a thriller. He also said it was difficult to stage a play that is inherently sexual and extremely violent in nature without making it feel pornographic. Waldschmidt said that he wanted to stage She Has a Name partially to show how horrible human trafficking is and partially because the play is so theatrically gripping.|$|E
25|$|Critics of Griffin's thesis, such as Chip Berlet, have <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of {{the claims}} in the book are refutable. Griffin has {{rejected}} these criticisms and debated Berlet.|$|E
25|$|Settlers {{also have}} {{disrupted}} schooling of children. In 2002 {{there was one}} attempted and two actual bombings of Palestinian schools by Jewish vigilante groups. In 2011 United Nations Special Rapporteur Richard A. Falk <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> Palestinian children have stopped attending school because of frequent settler harassment.|$|E
50|$|Before the race, Hinault {{had promised}} to help LeMond win the Tour. After the race, when he was {{reminded}} of <b>that</b> promise, Hinault <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the <b>many</b> attacks <b>that</b> he made were not against LeMond, but against his competitors.|$|R
50|$|Dwijendranath was {{a highly}} talented poet but a disorganised person. Rabindranath <b>said</b> <b>that</b> so <b>many</b> pages of Swapnaprayan used to float around the Jorasanko Thakur Bari that {{if it could be}} {{collected}} and published {{it would have been a}} valuable volume.|$|R
50|$|It is <b>said</b> <b>that</b> so <b>many</b> people {{claim to}} {{have been at the}} 2008 Junior Club Hurling Championship that if {{everyone}} who claims to have been there actually attended; Croke Park would have to have had double the current seating capacity.|$|R
25|$|The crew {{also helped}} several {{passengers}} who {{were unable to}} escape on their own; a pilot carried out one passenger with an injured leg.

25|$|The Monk's or Mack's Well water {{runs into}} the Carmel beneath Kilmaurs Place. It is <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> years ago the local lord tried to prevent the local people from using the well. It dried up until the lord changed his mind, but has run {{continuously}} ever since.|$|E
25|$|Again, in October 2012, a Supreme Court bench of Chief Justice Altamas Kabir and Justices Surinder Singh Nijjar and Jasti Chelameswar {{asked all}} state governments and Union territories to inform about {{compliance}} of its September 2006 judgement. The order was passed when Prakash Singh through his lawyer Prashant Bhushan <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> {{of the reforms}} (ordered by the Supreme Court) have yet not been implemented by many state governments.|$|E

25|$|The show {{is said to}} be a semi-fictional {{account of}} the ESPN SportsCenter team of Keith Olbermann and Dan Patrick, with Rydell {{representing}} Olbermann and McCall representing Patrick. Patrick has confirmed this on his syndicated radio program The Dan Patrick Show. It has also been <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of the story lines for Casey McCall were inspired by Craig Kilborn, who was an anchor on SportsCenter during the mid 1990s.|$|E
25|$|By the 1980s, Houston's {{economy had}} {{collapsed}} and occupancy rates declined. Many apartment complexes faced foreclosure, bankruptcy, {{and changes in}} ownership. Bill Zermeno, a city electrical inspector, said in a 1988 Houston Chronicle article {{that many of the}} apartments with some of the strongest violations against maintenance-related city laws were in Spring Branch. Kim Cobb, the author of the 1988 Houston Chronicle article, <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of the poorly maintained complexes were located next to well-maintained single family subdivisions.|$|E
25|$|After {{producer}} Brian Grazer {{first read}} an excerpt of Sylvia Nasar's book A Beautiful Mind in Vanity Fair magazine, he immediately purchased {{the rights to the}} film. He eventually brought the project to director Ron Howard, who had scheduling conflicts and was forced to pass. Grazer later <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> A-list directors were calling with their point of view on the project. He eventually focused on a particular director, who coincidentally was available only when Howard was also available. Grazer chose Howard.|$|E

25|$|Francis Spellman, Cardinal Archbishop of New York (died 1967) {{was long}} {{rumored to have}} been gay, {{according}} to a book by John Cooney, who <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> whom he interviewed took his homosexuality for granted. In addition, a book published in 1998 claims that during World War II, Spellman was carrying on {{a relationship with a}} chorus boy in the Broadway revue One Touch of Venus. Spellman defended Senator Joseph McCarthy's 1953 investigations of subversives and homosexuals in the federal government.|$|E
25|$|The EMS {{division}} was rocked by leadership scandals in 2004 and 2005. In August 2004, D.C. {{emergency medical services}} officials breached confidential patient records by taking them home, a blatant violation of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. EMS Medical Director Dr. Fernando Daniels III was terminated, and city investigators <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> {{or most of the}} EMS division's 35 managers could be fired. Daniels' successor, Dr. Clifford H. Turen, resigned on March 1, 2005, after it was learned that he had not yet received a license to practice medicine in the District of Columbia and his speciality was not in emergency medicine.|$|E
25|$|In 1898 Alex Manly of Wilmington, North Carolina, {{directly}} challenged popular {{ideas about}} lynching {{in an editorial}} in his newspaper The Daily Record, {{believed to be the}} only black-owned newspaper in the nation. He noted that consensual relationships took place between white women and black men, and <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>many</b> of the latter had white fathers (as he did). His references to miscegenation lifted the veil of denial. Whites were outraged. A mob destroyed his printing press and business, ran black leaders out of town and killed many others, and overturned the biracial Populist-Republican city government, headed by a white mayor and majority-white council. Manly escaped, eventually settling in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.|$|E
