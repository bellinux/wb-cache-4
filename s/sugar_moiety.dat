In this process, polypeptides that have a unique stretch of 3 amino acids (asparagine - X - serine/threonine, where X {{represents}} any amino acid except proline) are modified with a complex <b>sugar</b> <b>moiety</b> on the amide group of asparagine. Other types of glycosylations include S-linked (via cysteine residues), C-linked (via tryptophan) and O-linked (via serine or threonine).

50|$|Despite {{flexibility}} {{for different}} nucleoside analogs, UCK is unique among other nucleic acid kinsases in its specificity for ribose analogs over 2’-deoxyribose forms; whereas other proteins in the NMP kinase family will indiscriminately phosphorylate both deoxyribonucleosides and ribonucleosides, UCK2 only accepts ribonucleosides. This unique selectivity can be induced fit mechanisms {{and structural features}} that are unique to UCK2 among the NMP kinase family. Studies {{have shown that the}} binding of the cytidine/uridine <b>sugar</b> <b>moiety</b> results in the conformational change to reduce the distance between the His-117 and Arg-176 residues. Without the 2’-hydroxyl group on the <b>sugar</b> <b>moiety,</b> hydrogen bonding with Asp-84 and Arg-166 will be greatly reduced, resulting in diminished conformational change and weakened substrate binding.|$|E

40|$|Recently {{the number}} of studies {{investigating}} triterpenoid saponins has drastically increased due to their diverse and potentially attractive biological activities. Currently the literature contains chemical structures of few hundreds of triterpenoid saponins {{of plant and animal}} origin. Triterpenoid saponins consist of a triterpene aglycone with one or more <b>sugar</b> <b>moieties</b> attached to it. However, due to similar physico-chemical properties, isolation and identification of a large diversity of triterpenoid saponins remain challenging. This study demonstrates a methodology to screen saponins using hyphenated analytical platforms, GC-MS, LC-MS/MS, and LC-SPE-NMR/MS, in the example of two different phenotypes of the model plant Barbarea vulgaris (winter cress), glabrous (G) and pubescent (P) type that are known to differ by their insect resistance. The proposed methodology allows for detailed comparison of saponin profiles from intact plant extracts as well as saponin aglycone profiles from hydrolysed samples. Continuously measured 1 D proton NMR data during LC separation along with mass spectrometry data revealed significant differences, including contents of saponins, types of aglycones and numbers of <b>sugar</b> <b>moieties</b> attached to the aglycone. A total of 49 peaks were tentatively identified as saponins from both plants; they are derived from eight types of aglycones and with 2 – 5 <b>sugar</b> <b>moieties.</b> Identification of two previously known insect-deterrent saponins, hederagenin cellobioside and oleanolic acid cellobioside, demonstrated the applicability of the methodology for relatively rapid screening of bioactive compounds...|$|R

50|$|The main {{function}} of glycolipids {{in the body}} is to serve as recognition sites for cell-cell interactions.

30|$|APPT is a final {{metabolite}} of PPT-type ginsenosides {{by human}} intestinal bacteria {{that is not}} present in nature (Bae et al. 2005). The production of APPT is relatively difficult because it requires the complete hydrolysis of all the <b>sugar</b> <b>moieties</b> linked to the skeleton of PPT-type ginsenosides. Although APPT is currently produced via alkaline hydrolysis, alkaline treatment cannot exceed a yield of 80 %, shows low productivity, and produces a variety of by-products (Cui et al. 1993). In contrast, enzymatic hydrolysis can hydrolyze specific <b>sugar</b> <b>moieties</b> with high productivity and no by-products. Recently, β-glycosidase from Dictyoglomus turgidum (DT-bgl) {{was reported to be}} the most efficient APPT producer. However, this enzyme cannot hydrolyze the outer rhamnose residue at C- 6 in PPT (Lee et al. 2014). Thus, DT-bgl does not produce APPT from Re, Rg 2, and F 3.|$|R

50|$|Lincomycin is an {{antibiotic}} {{classified as a}} constituent of the lincosamide group, which typically feature a 6,8-dideoxy-6-aminooctose lincosamine. In Lincomycin A, this <b>sugar</b> <b>moiety</b> (referred to as methylthiolincosamide) is linked via an amide bond to an amino acid derivative (referred to as propylhygric acid). Lincomycin biosynthesis occurs via a biphasic pathway. Propylproline and methylthiolincosamide are each synthesized separately, which are then condensed to form N-demethyllincomycin and finally methylated by S-adenosyl methionine to give lincomycin.|$|E

Analogues of c-di-GMP have the potential to be used as chemical probes to study c-di-GMP signaling and could even become drug leads for the development of anti-biofilm compounds. Herein we report the synthesis and biophysical studies of a series of c-di-GMP analogues, which have both phosphate and <b>sugar</b> <b>moieties</b> simultaneously modified (called endo-S-c-di-GMP analogues). We used computational methods to predict the relative orientation of the guanine nucleobases in c-di-GMP and analogues. DOSY NMR of the endo-S-c-di-GMP series showed that the polymorphism of c-di-GMP can be tuned with conservative modifications to the phosphate and <b>sugar</b> <b>moieties</b> (conformational steering). Binding studies with Vc 2 RNA (a class I c-di-GMP riboswitch) revealed that conservative modifications to the phosphate and 2 &# 039;-positions of c-di-GMP dramatically affected binding to class I riboswitch...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} in large-scale production of biomass is the susceptibility to infections, especially when the growth medium is poor in nutrients- enabling the growth of various fungi and foreign algae.

In Prof. Boussiba’s lab this fungus has been researched and isolated and defined as a new species (Paraphyzoderma Sedebokerensis). This fungi is a specific parasite for Haematococci cells.
