5|$|The IAPT's {{primary purpose}} is the {{promotion}} {{and understanding of}} biodiversity—the discovery, naming, classification, and <b>systematics</b> of plants—for both living and fossil plants. Additionally, it promotes the study and conservation of plant biodiversity, and works {{to raise awareness of}} the general public to this issue. The organization also facilitates international cooperation among botanists working in the fields of plant <b>systematics,</b> taxonomy, and nomenclature. This is accomplished in part through sponsorship of meetings and publication of resources, such as reference publications and journals.|$|E
5|$|By the 1980s, protein {{sequencing}} had already transformed methods of scientific classification of organisms (especially cladistics) but biologists {{soon began to}} use RNA and DNA sequences as characters; this expanded the significance of molecular evolution within evolutionary biology, as the results of molecular <b>systematics</b> could be compared with traditional evolutionary trees based on morphology. Following the pioneering ideas of Lynn Margulis on endosymbiotic theory, which holds {{that some of the}} organelles of eukaryotic cells originated from free living prokaryotic organisms through symbiotic relationships, even the overall division of the tree of life was revised. Into the 1990s, the five domains (Plants, Animals, Fungi, Protists, and Monerans) became three (the Archaea, the Bacteria, and the Eukarya) based on Carl Woese's pioneering molecular <b>systematics</b> work with 16S rRNA sequencing.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{speciation}} events {{create a}} tree structured system {{of relationships between}} species. The role of <b>systematics</b> is to study these relationships and thus the differences and similarities between species and groups of species.|$|E
5|$|Rasmussen’s {{early work}} was largely focused on {{studies of the}} <b>systematics,</b> ecology and {{behaviour}} of Patagonian seabirds, notably cormorants. She studied plumage variations in juvenile blue-eyed, king and red-legged cormorants, and used plumage and behavioural patterns to establish relationships between king and blue-eyed shags. She also reviewed the fishing activity of olivaceous cormorants.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{studies have}} found some {{traditional}} Russulaceae species to comprise several cryptic species (see <b>Systematics</b> and taxonomy: Species diversity). This may imply that distribution range and population size for each of such distinct species are smaller than previously thought.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of such fields of study as phylogenetics, cladistics, and <b>systematics,</b> the Linnaean system has progressed {{to a system of}} modern {{biological}} classification based on the evolutionary relationships between organisms, both living and extinct.|$|E
5|$|Columbia University's Jesup Lectures {{were the}} {{starting}} point for many of the most important works of the modern evolutionary synthesis. The presenters introduced the connection between two important discoveriesthe units of evolution (genes) with selection as the primary mechanism of evolution. In 1941, Edgar Anderson (whose work on hybridization in the genus Iris had interested Stebbins since they met in 1930) and Ernst Mayr co-presented the lecture series and Mayr later published his lectures as <b>Systematics</b> and the Origin of Species. In 1946, Stebbins was invited on Dobzhansky's recommendation to present the prestigious lectures. Stebbins' lectures drew together the otherwise disparate fields of genetics, ecology, <b>systematics,</b> cytology, and paleontology. In 1950, these lectures were published as Variation and Evolution in Plants, which proved {{to be one of the}} most important books in 20th-century botany. The book brought botanical science into the new synthesis of evolutionary theory, and became part of the canon of biological works written between 1936 and 1950 that formed the modern synthesis of evolution.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{biology is}} partly based on paleontology, which uses {{the fossil record}} to answer {{questions}} about the mode and tempo of evolution, and partly on the developments in areas such as population genetics. In the 1980s, developmental biology re-entered evolutionary biology after its initial exclusion from the modern synthesis through the study of evolutionary developmental biology. Phylogenetics, <b>systematics,</b> and taxonomy are related fields often considered part of evolutionary biology.|$|E
5|$|Over 2,400 {{species of}} mantis in about 430 genera are recognized. They are {{predominantly}} found in tropical regions, but some live in temperate areas. The <b>systematics</b> of mantises {{have long been}} disputed. Mantises, along with stick insects (Phasmatodea), were once placed in the order Orthoptera with the cockroaches (now Blattodea) and rock crawlers (now Grylloblattodea). Kristensen (1991) combined the Mantodea with the cockroaches and termites into the order Dictyoptera, suborder Mantodea.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphological}} {{characteristics of}} caterpillars and pupae used for classification are {{completely different from}} that of adults; different classification schemes are sometimes provided separately for classifying adults, larvae and pupae. The characteristics of immature stages are increasingly used for taxonomic purposes as they provide insights into <b>systematics</b> and phylogenies of Lepidoptera that are not apparent from examination of adults.|$|E
5|$|While the <b>systematics</b> (evolutionary relationships) of nodosaurids {{have not}} been firmly established, the genera Sauropelta, Silvisaurus and Pawpawsaurus are {{sometimes}} considered to be basal to geologically younger nodosaurids like Panoplosaurus, Edmontonia, and Animantarx. In a 2001 analysis, Carpenter included the former three genera in a sister clade to a group containing the latter three, although he found that Panoplosaurus could belong to either clade, depending which taxa and characters were chosen.|$|E
5|$|After the war finished, Rogerson {{continued}} studying fungal <b>systematics</b> {{and started}} a doctoral program with Harry Morton Fitzpatrick at Cornell University; noted mycologist Richard Korf was another of Fitzpatrick's graduate students at the time. Under Fitzpatrick, Rogerson studied Hypomyces fungi and their anamorphs. Fitzpatrick committed suicide in 1950, and Donald S. Welch replaced him as Rogerson's advisor {{for the last few}} months of his doctoral program. Rogerson received his doctorate from Cornell in 1950. That year, he joined the faculty of Kansas State University as an assistant professor, but he would ultimately advance to associate professor. While at Kansas, he worked on the identification of fungi, and published nearly 20 papers on fungal taxonomic novelties, aeromycology (the fungal flora of air), and plant diseases caused by fungi.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} dinosaur families, the <b>systematics</b> (evolutionary relationships) {{within the family}} Abelisauridae are confused. Several {{cladistic}} {{studies have indicated that}} Majungasaurus shares a close relationship with Carnotaurus from South America, while others were unable to firmly place it in the phylogeny. The most recent analysis, using the most complete information, instead recovered Majungasaurus in a clade with Rajasaurus and Indosaurus from India, but excluding South American genera like Carnotaurus, Ilokelesia, Ekrixinatosaurus, Aucasaurus and Abelisaurus, as well as Rugops from mainland Africa. This leaves open the possibility of separate clades of abelisaurids in western and eastern Gondwana.|$|E
5|$|Before DNA analysis, the {{taxonomy}} of the widow spider genus Latrodectus had been unclear—changes {{in the number}} of species reflect the difficulty of using morphology to determine subdivisions within the genus. Substantial interest in their <b>systematics</b> was most likely prompted by the medical importance of these venomous spiders. Swedish arachnologist Tamerlan Thorell described the redback spider in 1870 from specimens collected in Rockhampton and Bowen in central Queensland. He named it Latrodectus hasseltii in honour of colleague A.W.M. van Hasselt. In the same paper, he named a female from Cape York with an all-black abdomen L. scelio, now regarded as the same species. These specimens are in the Naturhistoriska Riksmuseet in Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|Daspletosaurus {{is usually}} {{considered}} to be closely related to Tyrannosaurus rex, or even a direct ancestor through anagenesis. Gregory Paul reassigned D. torosus to the genus Tyrannosaurus, creating the new combination Tyrannosaurus torosus, but {{this has not been}} generally accepted. Many researchers believe Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus to be sister taxa or even to be the same genus, with Daspletosaurus a more basal relative. On the other hand, Phil Currie and colleagues find Daspletosaurus to be more closely related to Tarbosaurus and other Asian tyrannosaurids like Alioramus than to the North American Tyrannosaurus. The <b>systematics</b> (evolutionary relationships) of Daspletosaurus may become clearer once all the species have been described.|$|E
5|$|Feathers are {{a feature}} {{characteristic}} of birds (though {{also present in}} some dinosaurs not currently considered to be true birds). They facilitate flight, provide insulation that aids in thermoregulation, and are used in display, camouflage, and signalling. There are several types of feathers, each serving {{its own set of}} purposes. Feathers are epidermal growths attached to the skin and arise only in specific tracts of skin called pterylae. The distribution pattern of these feather tracts (pterylosis) is used in taxonomy and <b>systematics.</b> The arrangement and appearance of feathers on the body, called plumage, may vary within species by age, social status, and sex.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, the mammals were {{comprehensively}} revised by Malcolm C. McKenna and Susan K. Bell, {{which has}} resulted in the McKenna/Bell classification. Their 1997 book, Classification of Mammals above the Species Level, is a comprehensive work on the <b>systematics,</b> relationships and occurrences of all mammal taxa, living and extinct, down through the rank of genus, though molecular genetic data challenge several of the higher level groupings. The authors worked together as paleontologists at the American Museum of Natural History, New York. McKenna inherited the project from Simpson and, with Bell, constructed a completely updated hierarchical system, covering living and extinct taxa that reflects the historical genealogy of Mammalia.|$|E
5|$|Modern botany is a broad, {{multidisciplinary}} {{subject with}} inputs from most {{other areas of}} science and technology. Research topics include the study of plant structure, growth and differentiation, reproduction, biochemistry and primary metabolism, chemical products, development, diseases, evolutionary relationships, <b>systematics,</b> and plant taxonomy. Dominant themes in 21st century plant science are molecular genetics and epigenetics, which are the mechanisms and control of gene expression during differentiation of plant cells and tissues. Botanical research has diverse applications in providing staple foods, materials such as timber, oil, rubber, fibre and drugs, in modern horticulture, agriculture and forestry, plant propagation, breeding and genetic modification, in the synthesis of chemicals and raw materials for construction and energy production, in environmental management, {{and the maintenance of}} biodiversity.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{morphology}} recognises {{a continuum}} between the major morphological categories of root, stem (caulome), leaf (phyllome) and trichome. Furthermore, it emphasises structural dynamics. Modern <b>systematics</b> {{aims to reflect}} and discover phylogenetic relationships between plants. Modern Molecular phylogenetics largely ignores morphological characters, relying on DNA sequences as data. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants enabled the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group to publish in 1998 a phylogeny of flowering plants, answering {{many of the questions}} about relationships among angiosperm families and species. The theoretical possibility of a practical method for identification of plant species and commercial varieties by DNA barcoding is the subject of active current research.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys dimidiatus is now {{recognized}} as one of eight species in the genus Oryzomys. O.dimidiatus is further part of the O.couesi section, which is centered on the widespread Central American O.couesi and also includes six other species with more limited and peripheral distributions. O.couesi occurs with O.dimidiatus in southeastern Nicaragua. Many aspects of the <b>systematics</b> of the O.couesi section remain unclear and {{it is likely that the}} current classification underestimates the true diversity of the group. Oryzomys is classified in the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.|$|E
5|$|Oryzomys gorgasi is the southeasternmost {{representative}} of the genus Oryzomys, which extends north into the eastern United States (marsh rice rat, O.palustris). O.gorgasi is further part of the O.couesi section, which is centered on the widespread Central American O.couesi and also includes six other species with more limited and peripheral distributions. Many aspects of the <b>systematics</b> of the O.couesi section remain unclear {{and it is likely}} that the current classification underestimates the true diversity of the group. Oryzomys is classified in the tribe Oryzomyini, a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.|$|E
5|$|Research by Matthew Baron, David B. Norman, and Paul M. Barrett in 2017 {{suggested}} a radical revision of dinosaurian <b>systematics.</b> Phylogenetic analysis by Baron et al. recovered the Ornithischia as being {{closer to the}} Theropoda than the Sauropodomorpha, {{as opposed to the}} traditional union of theropods with sauropodomorphs. They resurrected the clade Ornithoscelida to refer to the group containing Ornithischia and Theropoda. Dinosauria itself was re-defined as the last common ancestor of Triceratops horridus, Passer domesticus, Diplodocus carnegii, and all of its descendants, to ensure that sauropods and kin remain included as dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolutionary}} biologist Ernst Mayr {{was influenced}} by the work of the German biologist Bernhard Rensch showing the influence of local environmental factors on the geographic distribution of sub-species and closely related species. Mayr followed up on Dobzhansky's work with the 1942 book <b>Systematics</b> and the Origin of Species, which emphasized the importance of allopatric speciation in the formation of new species. This form of speciation occurs when the geographical isolation of a sub-population is followed by the development of mechanisms for reproductive isolation. Mayr also formulated the biological species concept that defined a species as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that were reproductively isolated from all other populations.|$|E
5|$|The type {{species is}} M. carinatus; seven other {{species have been}} named during the past 150years, but only M. kaalae among these is still {{considered}} valid. Early sauropodomorphs <b>systematics</b> have undergone numerous revisions during the last several years, and many scientists disagree where exactly Massospondylus lies on the dinosaur evolutionary tree. The family name Massospondylidae was once coined for the genus, but because knowledge of early sauropodomorph relationships {{is in a state}} of flux, it is unclear which other dinosaurs—if any—belong in a natural grouping of massospondylids; several 2007 papers support the family's validity.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{classification}} by Carleton and Arroyo-Cabrales, Oryzomys antillarum {{is one of}} eight species in the genus Oryzomys, which occurs from the eastern United States (O.palustris) into northwestern South America (O.gorgasi). O.antillarum is further part of the O.couesi section, which is centered on the widespread Central American O.couesi and also includes various other species with more limited and peripheral distributions. Many aspects of the <b>systematics</b> of the O.couesi section remain unclear {{and it is likely}} that the current classification underestimates the true diversity of the group. Oryzomys previously included many other species, which were progressively removed in various studies culminating in the 2006 paper by Weksler and colleagues, which excluded more than forty species from the genus. All are classified in the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.|$|E
5|$|O.albiventer {{is part of}} {{the genus}} Oryzomys, which {{currently}} includes about eight species distributed from the eastern United States (O.palustris) into northwestern South America (O.gorgasi). O.albiventer is further part of the O.couesi section, which is centered on the widespread Central American O.couesi and also includes various other species with more limited and peripheral distributions. Many aspects of the <b>systematics</b> of the O.couesi section remain unclear and {{it is likely that the}} current classification underestimates the true diversity of the group. Oryzomys previously included many other species, which were progressively removed in various studies culminating in a contribution by Marcelo Weksler and coworkers in 2006 that removed more than forty species from the genus. All are classified in the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.|$|E
5|$|The IAPT {{established}} two Engler Medals {{in honour of}} Adolf Engler in 1986: the Engler Medal in Gold awarded {{every six}} years for outstanding lifetime contributions to plant taxonomy and presented since 1987 at each International Botanical Congress (IBC), and the Engler Medal in Silver (medal sensu lato) awarded from 1987 to 2001 for a monograph or other work in systematic botany and presented from 1990 to 2002 at various meetings, congresses, symposia, etc. In 2002 the latter medal was divided into three awards for outstanding publications in these areas: the Engler Medal in Silver (medal sensu stricto) awarded for monographic or floristic plant systematics; the Stafleu Medal awarded for historical, bibliographic, and/or nomenclatural aspects of plant systematics; and the Stebbins Medal awarded for phylogenetic plant <b>systematics</b> and/or plant evolution. The medals honor Adolf Engler (24 Mar. 1844-10 Oct. 1930), Frans Antonie Stafleu (8 Sep. 1921-16 Dec. 1997), and George Ledyard Stebbins, Jr. (6 Jan. 1906-19 Jan. 2000).|$|E
5|$|The antbird family {{contains}} over 200 species, variously called antwrens, antvireos, antbirds and antshrikes. The names {{refer to}} the relative sizes of the birds (increasing in the order given, though with exceptions) rather than any particular resemblance to the true wrens, vireos or shrikes. In addition, members of the genus Phlegopsis are known as bare-eyes, Pyriglena as fire-eyes and Neoctantes and Clytoctantes as bushbirds. Although the <b>systematics</b> of the Thamnophilidae is based on studies from the mid-19th century, when fewer than half the present species were known, comparison of the myoglobin intron 2, GAPDH intron 11 and the mtDNA cytochrome b DNA sequences has largely confirmed it. There are two major clades – most antshrikes and other larger, strong-billed species as well as Herpsilochmus, versus the classical antwrens and other more slender, longer-billed species – and the monophyly of most genera was confirmed.|$|E
5|$|The genus Oryzomys {{currently}} includes {{about eight}} species distributed {{from the eastern}} United States (O.palustris) into northwestern South America (O.gorgasi). O.peninsulae {{is part of the}} O.couesi section, which is centered on the widespread Central American O.couesi and also includes various other species with more limited and peripheral distributions. Many aspects of the <b>systematics</b> of this section remain unclear and {{it is likely that the}} current classification underestimates the group's true diversity. Oryzomys was previously a much larger genus, but most species were progressively removed in various studies, culminating in contributions by Marcelo Weksler and coworkers in 2006 that excluded more than forty species from the genus. Oryzomys and many of the species removed from it are classified in the tribe Oryzomyini ("rice rats"), a diverse assemblage of American rodents of over a hundred species, and on higher taxonomic levels in the subfamily Sigmodontinae of family Cricetidae, along with hundreds of other species of mainly small rodents.|$|E
5|$|Traditional morphology-based or appearance-based <b>systematics</b> {{have usually}} given the Hexapoda {{the rank of}} superclass, and {{identified}} four groups within it: insects (Ectognatha), springtails (Collembola), Protura, and Diplura, the latter three being grouped together as the Entognatha {{on the basis of}} internalized mouth parts. Supraordinal relationships have undergone numerous changes with the advent of methods based on evolutionary history and genetic data. A recent theory is that the Hexapoda are polyphyletic (where the last common ancestor was {{not a member of the}} group), with the entognath classes having separate evolutionary histories from the Insecta. Many of the traditional appearance-based taxa have been shown to be paraphyletic, so rather than using ranks like subclass, superorder, and infraorder, it has proved better to use monophyletic groupings (in which the last common ancestor is a member of the group). The following represents the best-supported monophyletic groupings for the Insecta.|$|E
5|$|Classification {{seeks to}} {{describe}} the diversity of bacterial species by naming and grouping organisms based on similarities. Bacteria can be classified {{on the basis of}} cell structure, cellular metabolism or on differences in cell components, such as DNA, fatty acids, pigments, antigens and quinones. While these schemes allowed the identification and classification of bacterial strains, it was unclear whether these differences represented variation between distinct species or between strains of the same species. This uncertainty was {{due to the lack of}} distinctive structures in most bacteria, as well as lateral gene transfer between unrelated species. Due to lateral gene transfer, some closely related bacteria can have very different morphologies and metabolisms. To overcome this uncertainty, modern bacterial classification emphasises molecular <b>systematics,</b> using genetic techniques such as guanine cytosine ratio determination, genome-genome hybridisation, as well as sequencing genes that have not undergone extensive lateral gene transfer, such as the rRNA gene. Classification of bacteria is determined by publication in the International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology, and Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. The International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology (ICSB) maintains international rules for the naming of bacteria and taxonomic categories and for the ranking of them in the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{establishment}} of evolutionary biology, studies of mutation and genetic diversity in natural populations, combined with biogeography and <b>systematics,</b> led to sophisticated mathematical and causal models of evolution. Paleontology and comparative anatomy allowed more detailed reconstructions of the evolutionary history of life. After the rise of molecular genetics in the 1950s, the field of molecular evolution developed, based on protein sequences and immunological tests, and later incorporating RNA and DNA studies. The gene-centered view of evolution rose to prominence in the 1960s, followed by the neutral theory of molecular evolution, sparking debates over adaptationism, the unit of selection, and {{the relative importance of}} genetic drift versus natural selection as causes of evolution. In the late 20th-century, DNA sequencing led to molecular phylogenetics and the reorganization of the tree of life into the three-domain system by Carl Woese. In addition, the newly recognized factors of symbiogenesis and horizontal gene transfer introduced yet more complexity into evolutionary theory. Discoveries in evolutionary biology have made a significant impact not just within the traditional branches of biology, but also in other academic disciplines (for example: anthropology and psychology) and on society at large.|$|E
