5000|$|The pistol is {{disassembled}} {{by removing}} the magazine, cocking the hammer and putting the safety in the [...] "safe" [...] position.

The barrel can now be removed from <b>the</b> <b>slide.</b> To reassemble <b>the</b> pistol, insert the barrel back in <b>the</b> <b>slide.</b> Place <b>the</b> <b>slide</b> into <b>the</b> guides in the frame.

25|$|The reach method, (or hose trace method), is {{the most}} {{reliable}} as it will work in all cases where the DV is not snagged somewhere. The diver reaches back over the right shoulder to the low pressure hose feeding the DV, and loops thumb and fingers round the hose, then <b>slides</b> <b>the</b> hand along the hose, pulling it forward and over the shoulder until the DV is in the right hand, at which stage it can be turned the right way round and replaced in the mouth.|$|E

25|$|One of the first-generation Secret Service copies was lent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington, {{which made}} a second-generation copy on November 25. After study of that copy in January 1964, the Warren Commission judged the quality to be inadequate, and {{requested}} the original.

25|$|On 5 February 2010, {{heavy rains}} and hail caused {{flooding}} and mudslides in the region, with Angangueo being hard hit. Landslides {{on two of}} the hills surrounding the town buried sections and blocked roads. The week prior a smaller slide had killed three miners. The slides forced the evacuation of hundreds, due to the danger of more <b>slides.</b> <b>The</b> Topos de Tlatelolco assisted with the search for survivors and bodies. At least 1,000 persons were made homeless and moved to a shelter in San José del Rincón, Mexico State. Many houses built on the riverbanks were swept away. At least thirty were killed by the event in the town alone. Bodies were found in the municipal seat and in smaller communities such as Salitre. 2,500 people lost everything in the disaster.|$|E
25|$|Twelve {{persons are}} known to have perished – some carried away by the waves of the lake, others crushed beneath their {{collapsing}} houses. Thus the beautiful town of Taal remains a deserted wilderness and reduced to the utmost misery, while once {{it was one of the}} richest and most flourishing places. In the villages to the west of the lake, which were the greater and better part, all the houses have either collapsed under the load of material which had been piled upon them or have disappeared completely, swept away by the waves which in these places were so violent that they dug three ditches or channels, too wide and deep to be forded, and thus rendered impassable the road which joins the town with Balayan. In other parts of the lake shore have likewise opened many cracks and occurred very extensive <b>slides.</b> <b>The</b> worst of all is, that, the mouth of the river Pansipit having been blocked, the lake is rising and invading the towns of Lipa and Tanauan, both being on the lowest level, and inundating their buildings. All the animals of whatever kind have perished, some by being buried, others by drowning, the rest by starving, as not a green blade remained anywhere.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, KTVU {{obtained}} the local broadcast {{rights to the}} Warner Bros. Pictures library; the films it broadcast from the studio primarily consisted of those released during the 1950s, most being presented in color, which aired at 7:00p.m. on Sundays. Channel 2 was the first television station in the Bay Area to air such films as A Star Is Born, East of Eden and Rebel Without a Cause. KTVU exercised discretion and limited the amount of commercial break interruptions during the movie telecasts, often airing the films uncensored and with commentary, either by a studio host or via <b>slides.</b> <b>The</b> station even televised the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film Hollywood Revue of 1929 {{with some of the}} original two-strip Technicolor sequences. During the early 1970s, the station began employing a different programming strategy to stand out from the other independents in the market, acquiring first-run syndicated sitcoms and drama series, several comedies and dramas from the United Kingdom (such as Upstairs, Downstairs and The Benny Hill Show, the latter of which had some episodes re-edited by the station to remove scenes of frontal nudity accidentally left in the broadcast prints), and various nature series (including National Geographic specials) as alternative offerings.|$|E

40|$|The Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) {{technique}} {{with high}} precision and spatial resolution is a suitable sensor for flow field experiments.

500|$|The slide {{tower in}} the {{southeast}} corner of the park contains five slides designed for those who desire a mild thrill. Some of the slides on this tower interact with Dreamworld's Cyclone roller coaster. The Little Rippers are two ProSlide duelling cannon bowl <b>slides.</b> <b>The</b> slides can accommodate guests riding in either one or two person tubes. Riders begin in one of two parallel chutes before entering tunnels and splitting off in opposite directions. Each tunnel has a steep drop into the bowl element of the ride, after which the raft drops down through the centre and into a run-out chute. The other three slides on this tower are collectively known as The Temple of Huey. Guests can ride in a single or double tube. All three slides are ProSlide Pipelines. The three slides are individually named Broken Headz, Cut Snake and Screamin Right Handers and are [...] long respectively. Broken Headz and Cut Snake are enclosed and Screamin Right Handers is an open flume.|$|E
500|$|The slide tower {{near the}} {{entrance}} contains the park's main thrill <b>slides.</b> <b>The</b> Wedgie is a body slide featuring a trap-door release into a near-vertical [...] drop. Riders then enter a fast, downward-spiralling turn and reach speeds of nearly [...] before they are slowed in a run-out chute. The ride was the first ProSlide SuperLOOP in the world. The Green Room consists of four people boarding a cloverleaf-shaped tube in which they traverse a [...] long tunnel followed by a [...] drop into a funnel. Within the funnel, riders oscillate back and forth up the walls at the side and drop into a splash pool. Since its opening, The Green Room has been Australia's largest ProSlide Tornado beating Wet'n'Wild Water World's Tornado in height and tunnel length. On the Super Tubes Hydrocoaster, three people sit on a [...] raft, whose weight is mainly attributable to a large magnet on its underside. Riders experience several steep drops followed by magnet-powered inclines, ending with a splashdown in a small pool. The Super Tubes Hydrocoaster was the second ProSlide Hydro Magnetic Rocket Slide {{in the world and}} continues to be Australia's only water coaster.|$|E
