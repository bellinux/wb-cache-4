60|$|My <b>son</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had a quiet hour {{together}} on that happy night before we retired to rest. The little love-plot invented in George's interests now required one last stroke of diplomacy to complete it before we all threw off our masks and assumed our true characters for the future. When my <b>son</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> parted for the night, {{we had planned}} the necessary stratagem for taking our lovely guest by surprise {{as soon as she}} was out of her bed in the morning.|$|E

2500|$|The murder gained greater {{attention}} in the Capital District as Joan Porco, emerging from a medically induced coma, maintained that Christopher {{had nothing to do}} with her husband's murder. During videotaped testimony submitted to the grand jury in December 2004, Joan testified about her family, but did not identify her son as an attacker. Nine months later, she wrote a letter for publication in the Albany Times Union about Christopher: [...] "I implore the Bethlehem Police and the District Attorney's Office to leave my <b>son</b> alone, <b>and</b> to search for Peter's real killer or killers, so that he can rest in peace <b>and</b> my <b>sons</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can live in safety." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Ay, lass," [...] {{the captain}} {{answered}} for him. [...] "I am the boy's father, {{and a happy}} father, too, as you may guess, at finding I have such a <b>son.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> hear {{he has been a}} good friend to you, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Myouk <b>and</b> his <b>son</b> Meetek <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{have had}} a most {{exciting}} bear-hunt since we returned.

6000|$|... "So am I. I {{ought to}} have been a good <b>son,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think I meant to have been one. But I wasn't. I was a thundering bad son, that's the long and the short of it, and never was a credit to anybody." ...|$|E
60|$|I am so far {{a believer}} in a {{biological}} backbone for the college phase of education that I have secured it for my <b>sons</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have done all I can to extend it in England. Nevertheless, important as that formal college work was to me, it still {{seems to me that}} the informal part of our college life--the talk, the debates, the discussion, the scampering about London to attend great political meetings, to hear William Morris on Socialism, Auberon Herbert on Individualism, Gladstone on Home Rule, or Bradlaugh on Atheism--for those were the lights of my remote student days--was about equally important.|$|R
