40|$|The {{contribution}} of subterranean <b>drain</b> <b>sumps</b> to pupal and adult populations of Aedes aegypti is {{reported for the}} 1 st time in Cairns, Australia. Pupal surveys were used to quantify the relative {{contribution of}} <b>drain</b> <b>sumps</b> to {{the total population of}} Ae. aegypti by concurrent survey of sump and water-bearing containers in yards of inner-city premises. A total of 854 mosquito pupae were collected, predominantly Ae. aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus (26. 3 and 69. 8 %, respectively). <b>Drain</b> <b>sumps</b> provided a relatively uncommon (n = 4) but productive source for pupal Ae. aegypti, producing 14. 7 % of the combined yard and <b>drain</b> <b>sump</b> population. <b>Drain</b> <b>sumps</b> in inner-city Cairns most commonly occurred in parking lots (52. 6 %). Subsequently, a sticky emergent adult trap (SEAT) was developed to provide a pragmatic method to assess production of Ae. aegypti by <b>drain</b> <b>sumps.</b> A total of 866 adult mosquitoes were trapped from 162 <b>drain</b> <b>sumps</b> over a 48 -h exposure period, comprising Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus (21 and 79 %, respectively). Advantages of the SEAT are an ability to rapidly count, identify, and sex mosquitoes and to provide specimens for molecular analysis where necessary. The treatment of water-bearing <b>drain</b> <b>sumps</b> is a critical element of control campaigns against Ae. aegypti...|$|R

50|$|In {{preparation}} for freezing temperatures, an in-ground swimming pool's pipes must be emptied. An above-ground pool {{should also be}} closed, so that ice does not drag down the pool wall, collapsing its structure. The plumbing is sealed with air, typically with rubber plugs, to prevent cracking from freezing water. The pool is typically covered to prevent leaves and other debris from falling in. The cover {{is attached to the}} pool typically using a stretch cord, similar to a bungee cord and hooks fitted into the pool surround. The skimmer is closed off or a floating device is placed into it to prevent it from completely freezing and cracking. Floating objects such as life rings or basketballs can be placed in the pool to avoid its freezing under the cover. Sand or DE filters must be backwashed, with the main <b>drain</b> <b>plug</b> removed and all water <b>drained</b> out. <b>Drain</b> <b>plugs</b> on the pool filter are removed after the filter has been cleaned. The pool pump motor is taken under cover. Winter chemicals are added to keep the pool clean.

50|$|Magnetic filters use a {{permanent}} magnet or an electromagnet to capture ferromagnetic particles. An advantage of magnetic filtration is that maintaining the filter simply requires cleaning the particles {{from the surface}} of the magnet.

Some companies are manufacturing magnets that attach to the outside of an oil filter or magnetic <b>drain</b> <b>plugs</b> -- first invented and offered for cars and motorcycles in the mid-1930s -- to aid in capturing these metallic particles, though there is ongoing debate as to the effectiveness of such devices.|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} case of a bronchobiliary fistula {{following}} an intrahepatic abscess {{as a result of a}} bile leak after an elective open cholecystectomy. CASE REPORT A 64 year old woman with history of scleroderma had an elective open cholecystectomy. One week later she developed a subhepatic bile collection. A subhepatic drain was inserted but she developed a persistent bile fistula. Endoscopy revealed a leak from the cystic duct. A 10 French gauge stent was inserted into the common bile duct beyond the level of the cystic duct. The bile leak resolved, but two months following discharge she developed right upper quadrant pain, rigors and bilioptysis (a cough productive of bile). Chest radiograph showed a right sided pleural effusion and CT scan demonstrated a large abscess in the right lobe of the liver (Fig). Percutaneous drainage was unsuccessful so a laparotomy was performed. A large area of the right lobe of the liver (most of segments VII and VIII) was found to be necrotic, and a defect was noted in the dome of the diaphragm, which appeared to communicate with the right chest cavity. The necrotic parenchyma was excised and two large <b>sump</b> <b>drains</b> were inserted, one int...|$|R
40|$|Developmental radon {{reduction}} {{techniques have}} been installed in 16 houses near Dayton. Sub-slab suction and <b>sump</b> (<b>drain</b> tile) suction have reduced radon levels in five basement houses below 4 picocuries per liter (pCi/L) -or 148 Becquerels {{per cubic meter}} (B~/I$) [...] based upon short-term radon measurements. In one of these houses, soil gas flow in the system was only 4 ft^/min (2 L/sec). In two houses which had a basement plus an adjoining slab on grade, sub-slab suction in the basement alone adequately reduced radon levels in the entire house. Radon was reduced by over 90 percent in each of four slab-ongrade houses using sub-slab suction from outdoors, even though forced-air heating supply ducts under the slabs appeared to prevent effective extension of. ke suction field under the slab. Forced-air exhaust of the crawl space in four crawl space houses proved more effective in reducing radon in the living area than did natural ventilation of the crawl space.

40|$|To remove body fluids, {{preventing}} {{an accumulation}} of fluid and assist wound healing. BACKGROUND INFORMATION A drain describes any material or equipment used to prevent {{the formation of a}} haematoma or to carry fluid from inside the body to the surface. Allowing unwanted fluid or blood to remain in a wound may be a potential source of infection and may also impede healing, or result in wound breakdown and dehiscence. Wound drains are classified as closed or open drainage systems. 1. Closed drains do not expose the contents to the atmosphere. They include vacuum drains which apply negative pressure such as the Redivac®, or non-vacuum systems such as the T-tube drain. 1 The drain is often secured with a suture. The use of a closed drain system lowers the risk of potential infection for patients and reduces staff contact with body fluids. 2. Open drains allow communication with the atmosphere. These drains include corrugated drains, the Penrose <b>drain</b> and <b>sump</b> <b>drains.</b> 1 Open drains are inserted directly into the wound bed and they drain into a dressing. As they have an open end there is the potential for infection. Open drains are usually secured by a suture and may have a safety pin attache...|$|R
