25|$|A third {{stimulus}} was {{the changes}} in the criteria for University examinations in the early 1970s.

Thus the government decided that Tamil students had to achieve a higher score than the <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> the exam in Sinhala to enter the universities.

25|$|In 2007, a study {{ordered by}} Congress found that middle school <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> part in abstinence-only sex {{education}} programs {{were just as}} likely to have sex in their teenage years as those who did not. From 1999 to 2006, the study tracked more than 2,000 students from age 11 or 12 to age 16; the study included students who had participated in one of four abstinence education programs, as well as a control group who had not participated in such a program. By age 16, about half of each group students in the abstinence-only program as well as students in the control group were still abstinent. Abstinence program participants who became sexually active during the 7-year study period reported having similar numbers of sexual partners as their peers of the same age; moreover, they had sex {{for the first time at}} about the same age as other students. The study also found that <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> part in the abstinence-only programs were {{just as likely to}} use contraception when they did have sex as those who did not participate. Abstinence-only education advocates claim the study was too narrow, began when abstinence-only curricula were in their infancy, and ignored other studies that have shown positive effects.|$|E
25|$|Indian {{influences}} {{came first}} with Shaivism and Buddhism penetrating deeply into society, blending with indigenous tradition and culture.

Resi's authorities were merely ceremonial. At the courts, Brahmin clerics and pudjangga (sacred literati) legitimised rulers and linked Hindu cosmology to their political needs.

25|$|In 2013, Blackhawk High School offered 15 Advanced Placement (AP) courses, at {{a higher}} cost than regular courses. The student pays the fee for the exam, which was $89 per test per pupil in 2012. Students {{have the option of}} taking College Board-approved courses and then taking the board's {{examination}} in the spring. Students who achieve a 3 or better on the exam may be awarded college credits at US universities and colleges. Each higher education institution sets its own standards about what level of credits are awarded to a student based on their AP exam score. Most give credits for scores of 4 or 5. Some also give credits for scores of 3. High schools give credits towards graduation to students who take the school's AP class. At Blackhawk High School 66% of <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> an AP course earned a 3 or better on the exam.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in fall 2002, smaller {{high schools}} were {{established}} within the JFK campus, co-existing with Kennedy High School. Marble Hill High School was opened in September 2002. The Bronx School of Law and Finance and Bronx Theatre High School were opened in September 2003. The Bronx School for Law & Finance was opened in September 2004. The enrollment of John F. Kennedy High School began shrinking in 2004 as the small schools grew, with a target cap of 2,500 students. Results from the 2010-11 NYC School Survey were abysmally low. Over half of <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>took</b> the survey {{reported that their}} peers did not respect teachers or other students; over 70 percent of teachers reported the same; meanwhile the school became increasingly plagued by crime and poor academic results. In late-2010, the Department of Education decided to shut John F. Kennedy by eliminating one grade per year until it graduated its last class in 2014. Crucial to the decision to close the school was the DOE’s assertion that the school was under performing, earning an overall D on its 2009-10 progress report, with a F grade for student performance. According to the DOE, four-year graduation rate at Kennedy High School was 46%, {{as opposed to a}} 63% average for the city. JFK High School graduated its final class in June 2014.|$|E

40|$|In many {{education}} and work environments, economic agents must perform several mental tasks {{in a short}} period of time. As with physical fatigue, it is likely that cognitive fatigue can occur and affect performance if a series of mental tasks are scheduled close together. In this paper, we identify the impact of time between cognitive tasks on performance in a particular context: the taking of Advanced Placement (AP) exams by high-school students. We exploit the fact that AP exam dates change from year to year, so that <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>take</b> two subject exams in one year may have a different number of days between the exams than <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>take</b> the same two exams in a different year. We find strong evidence that a shorter amount of time between exams is associated with lower scores, particularly on the second exam. Our estimates suggest that <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>take</b> exams with 10 days of separation are 8 % more likely to pass both exams than <b>students</b> <b>who</b> <b>take</b> the same two exams with only 1 day of separation...|$|R
