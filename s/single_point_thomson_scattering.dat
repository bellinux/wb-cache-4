The method is a direct and unambiguous one, widely used for the localised and simulta-neous measurements of the above parameters. In <b>Thomson</b> <b>scattering</b> experiment, the light scattered by the plasma electrons {{is used for the}} measurements.

40|$|The Current Drive Experiment-Upgrade (CDX-U) is {{the first}} spherical torus (ST) to {{investigate}} radio frequency (RF) heating and current drive. To address the concern that large magnetic field line pitch at the outboard midplane of STâ€™s could inhibit successful coupling to the high harmonic fast wave (HHFW), a rotatable, two strap antenna was installed on CDX-U. Parasitic loading and impurity generation were discovered to be weak and nearly independent of antenna phasing and angle over a wide range, and fast wave electron heating has been observed. Plasma densities up to about 1012 cm- 3 were obtained with noninductive startup solely with HHFW. New ST diagnostics under development on CDX-U include a multilayer mirror (MLM) detector to measure ultrasoft X-rays, a twelve spatial <b>point</b> <b>Thomson</b> <b>scattering</b> (TS) system, and an Electron Bernstein Wave (EBW) system for both electron heating and electron temperature measurements.

The rapid development of the machine has led to very exciting physics results during the first full year of physics operation. Pulse lengths in excess of 0. 5 s have been obtained with inductive current drive. Up to 4 MW of High Harmonic Fast Wave (HHFW) heating power has been applied with 6 MW planned.

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{problems}} in performing <b>Thomson</b> <b>scattering</b> experiments in low-density plasmas is the very high stray light intensity in comparison with the <b>Thomson</b> <b>scattering</b> intensity.

The beam is then guided in the fluorescent lamp, where the <b>Thomson</b> <b>scattering</b> process takes place.

The shape change of the <b>Thomson</b> <b>scattered</b> spectrum of an argon plasma with power and pressure variation was demonstrated, and the corresponding changes in electron parameters mapped. Trends shown were in good agreement with other TS measurements in inductively coupled argon plasmas, although absolute electron parameter values appeared somewhat higher; {{this may be due to}} differing power deposition and system geometry. TS measurements in the capacitive and inductive modes of the GEC cell demonstrated a rise in electron density, mainly in the higher-temperature electron population, produced by the switch to inductive heating; possible mechanisms behind this were discussed. The <b>Thomson</b> <b>scattering</b> results from argon plasmas were compared with Langmuir probe measurements from the same system. The low-temperature electron population evidenced by TS measurements was not apparent from the probe eedf's; this is likely due to the problematic nature of probe operation at very low energies. Parameter trends were in good agreement with the Langmuir probe results, but electron densities measured by <b>Thomson</b> <b>scattering</b> were consistently higher. This corresponds with the results of other probe:TS comparisons, and may be due to plasma perturbation by the probe. The first <b>Thomson</b> <b>scattering</b> measurements reported in gas mixtures were performed in Ar:N_ 2 plasmas at 100 mTorr and 300 W. Increasing nitrogen content changed the spectrum from Maxwellian to bi-Maxwellian.

40|$|<b>Thomson</b> <b>scattering</b> has {{recently}} been introduced as a fundamental diagnostic of plasma conditions and basic physical processes in dense, inertial confinement fusion plasmas. Experiments at the Nova laser facility [E. M. Campbell et al., Laser Part.

In addition, observations of fast and slow ion acous- tic waves in two-ion species plasmas have also allowed an independent measurement of the ion temperature.

For this purpose a high energy 4 {omega} probe laser was implemented recently allowing ultraviolet <b>Thomson</b> <b>scattering</b> at various locations in high-density gas-filled hohlraum plasmas. In partic- ular, the observation of steep electron temperature gradients indicates that electron thermal transport is inhibited in these gas-filled hohlraums.
