5|$|<b>Social</b> <b>{{anthropology}}</b> is {{the branch}} of anthropology that studies how contemporary living human beings behave in social groups. Practitioners of <b>social</b> <b>anthropology,</b> like sociologists, investigate various facets of social organization. Traditionally, social anthropologists analysed non-industrial and non-Western societies, whereas sociologists focused on industrialized societies in the Western world. In recent years, however, <b>social</b> <b>anthropology</b> has expanded its focus to modern Western societies, meaning that the two disciplines increasingly converge.|$|E

5|$|Aronofsky {{attended}} Harvard University, {{where he}} studied film and <b>social</b> <b>anthropology,</b> and the American Film Institute {{where he studied}} directing. He won several film awards after completing his senior thesis film, Supermarket Sweep, which {{went on to become}} a National Student Academy Award finalist. Aronofsky's feature debut, the surrealist psychological thriller Pi, was shot in November 1997. The low-budget, $60,000 production, starring Sean Gullette, was sold to Artisan Entertainment for $1 million, and grossed over $3 million; Aronofsky won the Directing Award at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival and an Independent Spirit Award for best first screenplay.|$|E

5|$|Between 1935 and 1937, Kenyatta was {{employed}} as a linguistic informant for the Phonetics Department at University College London (UCL); his voice recordings of the Kikuyu language assisted Lilias Armstrong in her production of The Phonetic and Tonal Structure of Kikuyu. The book was posthumously published under Armstrong's name, although Kenyatta claimed {{that he should have}} been recognised as co-author. He enrolled at UCL as a student, studying an English course between January and July 1935 and then a course in phonetics from October 1935 to June 1936. Enabled {{by a grant from the}} International African Institute, he also took a <b>social</b> <b>anthropology</b> course under Bronisław Malinowski at the London School of Economics (LSE). Kenyatta lacked the qualifications normally required to join the course, but Malinowski was keen to support the participation of indigenous peoples in anthropological research. For Kenyatta, acquiring an advanced degree would bolster his status among Kenyans and display his intellectual equality with white Europeans.|$|E

50|$|Economic {{anthropology}} as {{influenced by}} Karl Polanyi and practiced by Marshall Sahlins and George Dalton challenged standard neoclassical economics {{to take account}} of cultural and social factors, and employed Marxian analysis into anthropological study. In England, British <b>Social</b> <b>Anthropology's</b> paradigm began to fragment as Max Gluckman and Peter Worsley experimented with Marxism and authors such as Rodney Needham and Edmund Leach incorporated Lévi-Strauss's structuralism into their work. Structuralism also influenced a number of developments in 1960s and 1970s, including cognitive anthropology and componential analysis.|$|R

Despite his father's concern that he was in danger of losing his already weak eyesight, Eliade read passionately. One of his favorite authors was Honoré de Balzac, whose work he studied carefully. Eliade also became acquainted with the modernist short stories of Giovanni Papini and <b>social</b> <b>anthropology</b> studies by James George Frazer.|$|E
25|$|As {{the course}} {{outlines}} of his Sorbonne lectures indicate, {{during this period}} he continues a dialogue between phenomenology and the diverse work carried out in psychology, all in order {{to return to the}} study of the acquisition of language in children, as well as to broadly take advantage of the contribution of Ferdinand de Saussure to linguistics, and to work on the notion of structure through a discussion of work in psychology, linguistics and <b>social</b> <b>anthropology.</b>|$|E
25|$|Scientific racism fell {{strongly}} out {{of favor}} in the early 20th Century, but the origins of fundamental human and societal differences are still researched within academia, in fields such as human genetics including paleogenetics, <b>social</b> <b>anthropology,</b> comparative politics, history of religions, history of ideas, prehistory, history, ethics, and psychiatry. There is widespread rejection of any methodology based on anything similar to Blumenbach's races. It is more unclear to which extent and when ethnic and national stereotypes are accepted.|$|E
