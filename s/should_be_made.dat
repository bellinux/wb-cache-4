On April 8, Gen. Creighton Abrams was briefed on the high losses in the several failed attempts to rescue Hambleton and Clark. He ordered that no further air CSAR would be attempted, but that given Hambleton's Top Secret clearance and knowledge of missiles and counter-measure technology, that every effort <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> to bring him out.|$|E
5|$|Communication plans <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> {{beforehand}} {{to inform}} of mitigation actions being undertaken. Spare parts and back-up systems should be in place prior to ash fall events to reduce service disruption and return functionality as quickly as possible. Good preparedness also includes the identification of ash disposal sites, before ash fall occurs, to avoid further movement of ash and to aid clean-up. Protective equipment such as eye protection and dust masks should be deployed for clean-up teams in advance of ash fall events.|$|E
5|$|Deep dives <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> {{only after}} a gradual {{training}} to test the individual diver's sensitivity to increasing depths, with careful supervision and logging of reactions.

Scientific evidence does not show that a diver can train to overcome any measure of narcosis at a given depth or become tolerant of it.|$|E

5|$|It is {{beneficial}} to give fluids, as this helps reduce dehydration.

In the past, both the Trendelenburg position and the left lateral decubitus position (Durant's maneuver) have been suggested as beneficial where air emboli are suspected, but are no longer recommended for extended periods, owing to concerns regarding cerebral edema.|$|E

A Thessalian delegate proposed that Philip <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>made</b> leader of the Amphictyonic forces, which therefore gave Philip a pretext to {{campaign in}} Greece; it is, however, probable that Philip would have gone ahead with his campaign anyway.|$|E
