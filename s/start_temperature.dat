50|$|Composition {{control of}} weld metal is often {{performed}} to maximise the volume fraction of acicular ferrite {{due to the}} toughness it imparts.

5000|$|At high temperatures, nitinol assumes an interpenetrating simple cubic {{structure}} {{referred to}} as austenite (also known as the parent phase). At low temperatures, nitinol spontaneously transforms to a more complicated monoclinic crystal structure known as martensite (daughter phase). [...] There are four transition temperatures associated to the austenite-to-martensite and martensite-to-austenite transformations. Starting from full austenite, martensite begins to form as the alloy is cooled to the so-called martensite <b>start</b> <b>temperature,</b> or Ms, and the temperature at which the transformation is complete is called the martensite finish temperature, or Mf.

50|$|In the {{martempering}} process, austenitized {{metal part}} is {{immersed in a}} bath at a temperature just above the martensite <b>start</b> <b>temperature</b> (Ms). By using interrupted quenching, the cooling is stopped at a point above the martensite transformation region to ensure sufficient time for the center to cool to the same temperature as the surface.

Martempering is a method by which the stresses and strains generated during the quenching of a steel component can be controlled.|$|E

5000|$|The {{annealing}} process for dual -phase steels consists of first holding the steel in the alpha + gamma temperature region {{for a set}} period of time. During that time C and Mn diffuse into the austenite leaving a ferrite of greater purity. The steel is then quenched so that the austenite is transformed into martensite, and the ferrite remains on cooling. The steel is then subjected to a temper cycle to allow some level of marten-site decomposition. By controlling the amount of martensite in the steel, {{as well as the}} degree of temper, the strength level can be controlled. Depending on processing and chemistry, the strength level can range from 350 to 960 MPa. [...] TRIP steels also use C and Mn, along with heat treatment, in order to retain small amounts of Austen and bainite in a ferrite matrix. Thermal processing for TRIP steels again involves annealing the steel in the a + g region {{for a period of time}} sufficient to allow C and Mn to diffuse into austenite. The steel is then quenched to a point above the martensite <b>start</b> <b>temperature</b> and held there. This allows the formation of bainite, an austenite decomposition product. While at this temperature, more C is allowed to enrich the retained austenite. This, in turn, lowers the martensite <b>start</b> <b>temperature</b> to below room temperature. Upon final quenching a metastable austenite is retained in the predominantly ferrite matrix along with small amounts of bainite (and other forms of decomposed austenite). This combination of micro-structures has the added benefits of higher strengths and resistance to necking during forming. This offers great improvements in formability over other high-strength steels. Essentially, as the TRIP steel is being formed, it becomes much stronger. Tensile strengths of TRIP steels are in the range of 600-960 MPa. Martensitic steels are also high in C and Mn. These are fully quenched to martensite during processing. The martensite structure is then tempered back to the appropriate strength level, adding toughness to the steel. Tensile strengths for these steels range as high as 1500 MPa.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1920s Davenport and Bain {{discovered}} a new steel microstructure which they provisionally called martensite-troostite, due to it being intermediate between the already known low-temperature martensite phase and what was then known as troostite (now fine-pearlite). This microstructure was subsequently named bainite by Bain's colleagues at the United States Steel Corporation [...] although {{it took some time}} for the name to be taken up by the scientific community with books as late as 1947 failing to mention bainite by name. Bain and Davenport also noted the existence of two distinct forms: 'upper-range' bainite which formed at higher temperatures and 'lower-range' bainite which formed near the martensite <b>start</b> <b>temperature</b> (these forms are now known as upper- and lower-bainite respectively). The early terminology was further confused by the overlap, in some alloys, of the lower-range of the pearlite reaction and the upper-range of the bainite with the additional possibility of proeutectoid ferrite.|$|E
50|$|Bainite {{occupies}} a region {{between these two}} process in a temperature range where iron self-diffusion is limited but there is insufficient driving force to form martensite. In contrast to pearlite, where the ferrite and cementite grow cooperatively, bainite forms by the transformation of carbon-supersaturated ferrite with the subsequent diffusion of carbon and the precipitation of carbides. A further distinction is often made between so-called lower-bainite, which forms at temperatures closer to the martensite <b>start</b> <b>temperature,</b> and upper-bainite which forms at higher temperatures. This distinction arises from the diffusion rates of carbon at the temperature at which the bainite is forming. If the temperature is high then the carbon will diffuse rapidly away from the newly formed ferrite and form carbides in the carbon-enriched residual austenite between the ferritic plates leaving them carbide-free. At low temperatures the carbon will diffuse more sluggishly and may precipitate before it can leave the bainitic ferrite. There is some controversy over the specifics of bainite's transformation mechanism; both theories are represented below.|$|E

50|$|Martempering {{is similar}} to austempering, in that the steel is {{quenched}} in a bath of molten metal or salts to quickly cool it past the pearlite-forming range. However, in martempering, {{the goal is to}} create martensite rather than bainite. The steel is quenched to a much lower temperature than is used for austempering; to just above the martensite <b>start</b> <b>temperature.</b> The metal is then held at this temperature until the temperature of the steel reaches an equilibrium. The steel is then removed from the bath before any bainite can form, and then is allowed to air-cool, turning it into martensite. The interruption in cooling allows much of the internal stresses to relax before the martensite forms, decreasing the brittleness of the steel. However, the martempered steel will usually need to undergo further tempering to adjust the hardness and toughness, except in rare cases where maximum hardness is needed but the accompanying brittleness is not. Modern files are often martempered.|$|E
