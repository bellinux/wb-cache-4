Further research published in 2012 by Robin Cuthbertson and colleagues found the motions required for Weishampel's model to be unlikely, and favored a model in which movements of the lower jaw produced grinding action. The lower jaw's joint with the upper jaw would permit anterior–posterior motion along with the usual rotation, and the anterior joint of the two halves of the lower jaw would also permit motion; in combination, the two halves of the lower jaw could move slightly back and forth as well as rotating slightly along their long axes. These motions would account for the observed tooth wear and a more solidly constructed skull than modeled by Weishampel.|$|E

50|$|Uninflected lexical {{signs in}} German Sign Language have at most two syllables. Syllables consist of two syllabic positions, {{described}} as Hold (H) and Movement (M). Holds consist of the handshape {{together with the}} hand orientation (together {{referred to as the}} hand configuration) at a specific location in signing space. Holds do not contain any change of location (movement from one location to another). Movements, on the other hand, involve a change of location and may involve <b>secondary</b> <b>movements</b> such as wiggling of the fingers. Syllables may then be grouped into the following types: M (the minimal syllable), HM, MH, HMH (the maximal syllable). In the case of HM syllables, for example, the hand configuration of the Movement moves away from the location of the Hold. A syllable of type M can consist of the following specifications: a path movement (from one location to another), a path movement with secondary movement (such as wiggling or twisting), or a secondary movement without path movement. The syllable type H (a segment without a Movement) is not allowed for phonotactical reasons.|$|E

Methods exist to estimate the magnitude of slowing and variability coefficients, but attempts to apply them in motor tasks have been scarce. In the present experiment we combined movement kinematic analysis, efficiency functions and Brinley plot to assess age-related slowing and variability of sensorimotor processes in a discrete Fitts' aiming task. Objectives: (1) Quantifying slowing and variability for the different sensorimotor processes involved in aiming movements, and (2) determining whether changes occurred continuously over time by comparing different age groups. Methods: 29 participants (24 - 90 years) divided into four age groups were tested. Target size manipulation resulted in three levels of difficulty. Total movement time, durations {{of the first and}} <b>secondary</b> <b>movement</b> phases and related variability were analyzed. Fitts and Brinley regression functions were calculated {{on the basis of the}} different movement variables. Results: Only older participants were slower than the three younger age groups. For this group, age-difficulty effect was observed for total movement times, but analyses showed that only the <b>secondary</b> <b>movement</b> phase slowed multiplicatively. Additive and proportional increases in variability were also observed in older participants for the first and <b>secondary</b> <b>movement</b> phases, respectively. For the <b>secondary</b> <b>movement</b> phase, estimated slowing coefficients were comparable to those reported in cognitive literature. In addition, Brinley analyses showed that variability increased more than movement time in the <b>secondary</b> <b>movement</b> phase. Discussion: Combination of the different methods of analysis allowed a precise assessment of the locus of slowing and variability of sensorimotor processes in the different movement phases. Results showed that significant changes in both slowing and variability of the different processes occurred late in life. Our findings also suggest that slowing could result from age-induced increase in noise produced by the neural system. Finally, the present results raise the question of whether age-related slowing and increase in variability observed in both cognitive and sensorimotor domains share common causes in the central nervous system.

50|$|Before the 1960s and 1970s, the {{prevailing}} interpretation of hadrosaurids like Edmontosaurus {{was that they}} were aquatic and fed on aquatic plants. An example of this is William Morris's 1970 interpretation of an edmontosaur skull with nonbony beak remnants. He proposed that the animal had a diet much like that of some modern ducks, filtering plants and aquatic invertebrates like mollusks and crustaceans from the water and discharging water via V-shaped furrows along the inner face of the upper beak. This interpretation of the beak has been rejected, as the furrows and ridges are more like those of herbivorous turtle beaks than the flexible structures seen in filter-feeding birds. Between the mid-1980s and {{the first decade of the}} 2000s, {{the prevailing}} interpretation of how hadrosaurids processed their food followed the model put forward in 1984 by David B. Weishampel. He proposed that the structure of the skull permitted motion between bones that resulted in backward and forward motion of the lower jaw, and outward bowing of the tooth-bearing bones of the upper jaw when the mouth was closed. The teeth of the upper jaw would grind against the teeth of the lower jaw like rasps, processing plant material trapped between them. Such a motion would parallel the effects of mastication in mammals, although accomplishing the effects in a completely different way. Work in the early 2000s has challenged the Weishampel model. A study published in 2008 by Casey Holliday and Lawrence Witmer found that ornithopods like Edmontosaurus lacked the types of skull joints seen in those modern animals that are known to have kinetic skulls (skulls that permit motion between their constituent bones), such as squamates and birds. They proposed that joints that had been interpreted as permitting movement in dinosaur skulls were actually cartilaginous growth zones. An important piece of evidence for Weishampel's model is the orientation of scratches on the teeth, showing the direction of jaw action. Other movements could produce similar scratches though, such as movement of the bones of the two halves of the lower jaw. Not all models have been scrutinized under present techniques. Vincent Williams and colleagues (2009) published additional work on hadrosaurid tooth microwear. They found four classes of scratches on Edmontosaurus teeth. The most common class was interpreted as resulting from an oblique motion, not a simple up-down or front-back motion, which is consistent with the Weishampel model. This motion is thought to have been the primary motion for grinding food. Two scratch classes were interpreted as resulting from forward or backward movement of the jaws. The other class was variable and probably resulted from opening the jaws. The combination of movements is more complex than had been previously predicted.Weishampel developed his model with the aid of a computer simulation. Natalia Rybczynski and colleagues have updated this work with a much more sophisticated three-dimensional animation model, scanning a skull of E. regalis with lasers.

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in sensor technology provide {{new opportunities for}} applications that utilize the user's movement as an input source. This thesis focuses on movement analysis, which is a sub-area of a larger field concerned with the interpretation of sensor signals of human movement. Movement analysis {{can be used to}} provide feedback for training motor tasks, which is of interest for application areas such as rehabilitation, sports, and ergonomics. Consciously controllable, goal-directed movements, which we call primary movements, lead to slight movements {{in other parts of the}} body that are beyond conscious control (<b>secondary</b> <b>movements).</b> <b>Secondary</b> <b>movements</b> are generated due to the mechanical interaction with the environment and physiological dependencies of the body. This thesis contributes methods to distinguish between primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>movements.</b> This is necessary in order to provide high-quality feedback for motor tasks that show a significant amount of secondary movement. This can be the case when the <b>secondary</b> <b>movements</b> are large because of large reaction forces (e. g., when shooting a ball) or when the primary movements to execute the task are small (e. g., in various forms of handcraft or musical instrument performance). Furthermore, a precise distinction between primary and secondary movement can be necessary to check whether the user keeps a part of the body still (e. g., as required by a gymnastic exercise). Apart from sensor-based feedback, our results can also be used to improve current gesture recognition methods by ignoring secondary movement in the sensor signal to avoid that a secondary movement is misinterpreted as an execution of a gesture. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is shown in the context of pianist arm movements, which are particularly challenging to analyze. The distinction between primary and secondary movement in one joint of the arm is based on the measured movement in that particular joint, an estimation of key reaction force from MIDI data, and the movement in the other joints of the arm. In order to know on which arm the estimated key reaction force acts, it is necessary to determine which hand has played a note. For that purpose two methods are introduced: One method is based on MIDI; the other one uses data from inertial sensors in combination to MIDI. A third method based on Computer Vision, which was originally developed for sign language recognition, is evaluated here for tracking pianist hands. Based on the analysis methods, two pedagogical applications were developed: One application supports an existing piano pedagogical movement notation and checks whether the player's movement conforms to the indicated movement. A user study with piano students of a music university shows that potential users judge that the system is useful for the training of technique. The second application visualizes the sensor data and allows synchronizing different performances of the same piece, making it easy to spot differences where a closer examination may be beneficial...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Three {{individuals}} {{lacking a}} corpus callosum, two due to callosotomy and one agenesis, and three age-matched healthy controls were tested on a bimanual task {{in which a}} discrete or rhythmic arm movement was ini-tiated following a visual signal while the other arm produced continuous, rhythmic movements. The control participants initiated the secondary, rhythmic move-ment in phase with the ongoing rhythmic base move-ment and the two limbs were coupled in an inphase mode across {{the duration of the}} trial. In contrast, the acallosal individuals failed to show phase entrainment at the ini-tiation of the <b>secondary,</b> rhythmic <b>movements.</b> More-over, the callosotomy patients exhibited weak coupling between the rhythmically moving limbs while the indi-vidual with callosal agenesis consistently synchronized in an antiphase mode. The control participants exhibited increased perturbation of the ongoing base movement when initiating a discrete movement; for the acallosal participants, the base movement was similarly perturbed in both <b>secondary</b> <b>movement</b> conditions. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that intermanual interactions observed during bimanual movements arise from various levels of control, and that these are distinct for discrete and rhythmic movements. Temporal cou-pling during rhythmic movements arises in large part from transcallosal interactions between the two hemi-spheres. The imposition of a <b>secondary</b> <b>movement</b> may transiently disrupt an ongoing rhythmic movement {{even in the absence of}} the corpus callosum.

Samples for exposure dating using the cosmogenic nuclide 36 Cl were collected from head scarps and blocks located within two long-term monitored landslides characterised by extensive block slides. The results indicate the oldest dated block detachment occurring in a subaerial environment at ca. 21 ka, when the sea level was about 130 m lower than at present. Mass movement possibly accelerated when sea level reached the landslide toe during the post-glacial marine transgression. Considering the timing of block movement, the landslide deposits observed today appear to be related to a first-time failure involving a large part of the slope, though and alternative hypothesis is also taken here into account. This main event is likely to have been followed by <b>secondary</b> <b>movements</b> influenced by toe undercutting and clay saturation due to rising sea level.

40|$|Visual {{information}} {{is vital for}} fast and accurate hand movements. It has been demonstrated that allowing free eye movements results in greater accuracy than when the eyes maintain centrally fixed. Three explanations as to why free gaze improves accuracy are: shifting gaze to a target allows visual feedback in guiding the hand to the target (feedback loop), shifting gaze generates ocular-proprioception {{which can be used}} to update a movement (feedback-feedforward), or efference copy could be used to direct hand movements (feedforward). In this experiment we used a double-step task and manipulated the utility of ocular-proprioceptive feedback from eye to head position by removing the second target during the saccade. We confirm the advantage of free gaze for sequential movements with a double-step pointing task and document eye-hand lead times of approximately 200 ms for both initial movements and <b>secondary</b> <b>movements.</b> The observation that participants move gaze well ahead of the current hand target dismisses foveal feedback as a major contribution. We argue for a feedforward model based on eye movement efference as the major factor in enabling accurate hand movements. The results with the double-step target task also suggest the need for some buffering of efference and ocular-proprioceptive signals to cope with the situation where the eye has moved to a location ahead of the current target for the hand movement. We estimate that this buffer period may range between 120 and 200 ms without significant impact on hand movement accuracy...|$|E

Findings showed that, when participants were startled, the secondary component was triggered despite incongruent kinesthetic information. However, this only occurred when the startle was presented late in the primary movement. This suggests that the <b>secondary</b> <b>movement</b> was not prepared prior to task initiation, but was "loaded" into lower brain structures {{at some point during the}} movement in preparation to be triggered by the CNS. This occurred late in the movement sequence, but >= 400 ms prior to reaching the target. These findings indicate that, in addition to ballistic RT tasks, a startle can be used to probe response preparation in ongoing compound movement tasks...|$|R
