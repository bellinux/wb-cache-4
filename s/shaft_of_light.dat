5|$|Early in December 1900, we {{received}} from Lowell Observatory in Arizona a telegram that a <b>shaft</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> {{had been seen}} to project from Mars (the Lowell observatory makes a specialty of Mars) lasting seventy minutes. I wired these facts to Europe and sent out neostyle copies through this country. The observer there is a careful, reliable man {{and there is no}} reason to doubt that the light existed. It was given as from a well-known geographical point on Mars. That was all. Now the story has gone the world over. In Europe it is stated that I have been in communication with Mars, and all sorts of exaggerations have spring up. Whatever the light was, we have no means of knowing. Whether it had intelligence or not, no one can say. It is absolutely inexplicable.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Tony follows Chastity into a cave in {{the woods}} and stumbles upon a bizarre <b>shaft</b> <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> Once Tony steps into the light, he is possessed with the same {{abilities}} that Max and Chastity have, the ability to vibrate at high frequencies, allowing Tony to move faster than normal vision can detect. At the same time, however, Max collapses and is sent to the hospital where it is found he is suffering from exhaustion, withdrawal, a concussion, muscular tears and skeletal fractures - basically, his abilities are killing him. Mulder eventually deduces that he possesses superhuman speed. Chastity sneaks Max out of the hospital where he returns to the cave (even though she suggested they go somewhere else for help but Max refused). Later, the sheriff finds the flashlight in Max's room and confronts his son about the murders. Max confesses and then attempts to kill his father, but Tony intervenes, taking the sheriff's gun; the sheriff is promptly taken to the hospital. That night, Tony and Chastity head to the cave so that Max won't use up any more of the remaining power. Once there, Chastity has been knocked unconscious by Max, who then confronts Tony, using his abilities to take back the gun before throwing it away. However, Chastity (having come to and using her abilities) takes the gun and shoots Max from behind, then allows herself to be shot by the same bullet; she tells Tony that she can't go back to the way things were before. Afterwards, Tony is seen in the hospital recuperating while numerous geological experts examined the cave, but were unable to identify anything unusual. The city then fills the cave with concrete, sealing it forever, leaving the question as to what caused the teenager-related ability a mystery.|$|E
40|$|Realistic {{rendering}} {{methods of}} natural phenomena in real-time {{have a variety}} of applications, such as flight simulators or computer games. The scattering effect due to atmospheric particles {{is one of the most}} important elements in creating realistic outdoor images. <b>Shafts</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> are caused by objects which shut out the sunlight, such as clouds and mountains. This paper proposes a method for creating outdoor images including <b>shafts</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> caused by mountains and clouds.

25|$|A beam {{projector}} is a lensless instrument {{with very}} little beam spread. It uses two reflectors. The primary reflector is a parabolic reflector and the secondary reflector is a spherical reflector. The parabolic reflector directs the light into nearly parallel beams, and the spherical reflector is {{placed in front of}} the lamp to reflect light from the lamp back to the parabolic reflector, which reduces spill. The result is an intense <b>shaft</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> that cannot be easily controlled or modified. The beam projector no longer is used {{to the extent that it}} once was, as newer fixtures and PAR lamps have created easier ways to produce the effect.|$|E

As the lights flicker on, they illuminate a massive boulder rolling toward the transport. The transport seems to back up as the boulder threatens to crush Jones and the tourists. At the last possible second, the transport accelerates and suddenly the floor seems to give way, sending the transport into the chamber below. An impact resonates through the chamber, as if the boulder has crashed down, nearly striking the transport.|$|E

[...] Kennedy expressed hope that the test ban would be the first step towards broader rapprochement, limit nuclear fallout, restrict nuclear proliferation, and slow the arms race {{in such a way that}} fortifies US security. Kennedy concluded his address in reference to a Chinese proverb that he had used with Khrushchev in Vienna two years prior. [...] "'A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step,'" [...] Kennedy said.

500|$|Spielberg {{devised the}} three trials that guard the Grail. For the first, the blades under which Indiana ducks like a {{penitent}} man were {{a mix of}} practical and miniature blades created by Gibbs and ILM. For the second trial, in which Indiana spells [...] "Iehova" [...] on stable stepping stones, {{it was intended to}} have a tarantula crawl up Indiana after he mistakenly steps on [...] "J". This was filmed and deemed unsatisfactory, so ILM filmed a stuntman hanging through a hole that appears in the floor, 30 feet above a cavern. As this was dark, it did not matter that the matte painting and models were rushed late in production. The third trial, the leap of faith that Indiana makes over an apparently impassable ravine after discovering a bridge hidden by forced perspective, was created with a model bridge and painted backgrounds. This was cheaper than building a full-size set. A puppet of Ford was used to create a shadow on the [...] by [...] model because Ford had filmed the scene against bluescreen, which did not incorporate the <b>shaft</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> from the entrance.|$|E
500|$|Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson: Cameron said {{he needed}} the cast to {{feel as though they}} were really on the Titanic, to relive its liveliness, and [...] "to take that energy and give it to Jack, [...] an artist who is able to have his heart soar". Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has toured {{numerous}} places in the world, including Paris. He wins two tickets onto the RMS Titanic in a poker game and travels as a third-class passenger with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight and meets her when she contemplates throwing herself off the stern of the ship. Her fiance's [...] "reward", an invitation to dine with them the next evening, enables Jack to mix with the first-class passengers for a night. When casting the role, various established actors, including Matthew McConaughey, Chris O'Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff, were considered, but Cameron felt that a few of the actors were too old for the part of a 20-year-old. Tom Cruise was interested in portraying the character, but his asking price was too much for the studio to consider. Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition. DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director Mali Finn. Initially, {{he did not want to}} portray the character and refused to read his first romantic scene on the set (see below). Cameron said, [...] "He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. But for one split second, a <b>shaft</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> came down from the heavens and lit up the forest." [...] Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability and told him, [...] "Look, I'm not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want." [...] Cameron rather envisioned the character as a James Stewart type. Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled [...] "J. Dawson". The real J. Dawson was Joseph Dawson, who shoveled coal in the bowels of the ship. [...] "It wasn't until after the movie came out that we found out that there was a J. Dawson gravestone," [...] said the film's producer, Jon Landau, in an interview.|$|E

He played {{the lead in}} Secret of the Incas, which was shot on location at the archeological site Machu Picchu and had numerous similarities to Raiders of the Lost Ark. Filmed a quarter-century before the latter film, [...] "Incas" [...] included a tomb scene with the revelatory <b>shaft</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> pointing out a clue on a map and featured Heston's roguish antiquities thief's costume and light beard; Raiders costume designer Deborah Nadoolman Landis noted that it was [...] "almost a shot for shot similar" [...] to the film on which she worked.|$|E
40|$|The {{display of}} {{realistic}} natural scenes {{is one of}} the most important research areas in computer graphics. The rendering of water {{is one of the}} essential components. This paper proposes an efficient method for rendering images of scenes within water. For underwater scenery, the <b>shafts</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> and caustics are attractive and important elements. However, computing these effects is difficult and time-consuming since light refracts when passing through waves. To address the problem, our method makes use of graphics hardware to accelerate the computation. Our method displays the <b>shafts</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> by accumulating the intensities <b>of</b> streaks <b>of</b> <b>light</b> by using hardware color blending functions. Making use of a Z-buffer and a stencil buffer accelerates the rendering of caustics. Moreover, by using a shadow mapping technique, our method can display <b>shafts</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> and caustics taking account of shadows due to objects...|$|R

A <b>shaft</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> focused on the Duke reading the King's proclamation also provides some colour; this phenomenon was remarked upon by contemporary newspaper reports. Artistic licence was taken with the dais shown as much higher that it actually was and some other architectural features of the building either downplayed or ignored. Roberts also honoured the [...] "Father of Federation", Henry Parkes, who had died five years previous.

2500|$|Hopper's Room in New York (1932) and Cape Cod Evening (1939) {{are prime}} {{examples}} of his [...] "couple" [...] paintings. In the first, {{a young couple}} appear alienated and uncommunicative—he reading the newspaper while she idles by the piano. The viewer takes {{on the role of}} a voyeur, as if looking with a telescope through the window of the apartment to spy on the couple's lack of intimacy. In the latter painting, an older couple with little to say to each other, are playing with their dog, whose own attention is drawn away from his masters. Hopper takes the couple theme to a more ambitious level with Excursion into Philosophy [...] (1959). A middle-aged man sits dejectedly {{on the edge of a}} bed.

[...] After his birth evil demons tried to destroy him, but with Ahura Mazda's protection, he survived all attempts on his life. [...] The Zoroastrian tradition differs from the Christian one because the divine only assists in the preservation of Zoroaster’s seed. [...] "The central scripture, the Avesta and also the Pahlavi texts include the tradition that the 'kingly glory' is handed onward from ruler to ruler and from saint to saint for the purpose of illuminating ultimately the soul of the Zarathushtra." [...] Also the scriptures clearly allude to conjugal relations between his parents, during which evil spirits try to prevent his conception. [...] But according to later tradition, Zoroaster's mother, Dughdova, was a virgin when she conceived Zoroaster by a <b>shaft</b> <b>of</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E
