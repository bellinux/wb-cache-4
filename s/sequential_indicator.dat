AIMS:: To compare cross-sectional and <b>sequential</b> quality <b>indicators</b> for risk factor management in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS:: The study population consisted of 1912 patients who received diabetes care from one of 40 general practitioners in The Netherlands. Clinical outcomes, prescriptions, and demographic {{data were collected from}} electronic medical records. Quality was assessed for glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control using indicators focusing on clinical outcomes, and treatment in relation to outcomes. Indicator results were compared with a reference method based on national guidelines for general practice. RESULTS:: According to the reference method, 76 % of the patients received management as recommended for glycemic control, 58 % for blood pressure control, and 67 % for lipid control. Cross-sectional indicators looking at patients adequately controlled gave estimates that were 10 - 25 % lower than the reference method. Estimates from indicators focusing on uncontrolled patients receiving treatment were 10 - 40 % higher than the reference method for blood pressure and glycemic control. <b>Sequential</b> <b>indicators</b> focusing on improvement in clinical outcomes or assessing treatment modifications in response to poor control gave results closer to the reference method.

First, methods are developed for collecting data related to diabetes care from electronic medical records. Important elements include a uniform procedure for patient selection and the extraction of relevant data from records without burdening practices with extra registration requirements. These methods were successfully implemented in the Groningen Initiative to Analyse Type 2 diabetes Treatment (GIANTT) project to build a longitudinal observational database for monitoring diabetes care. The second part concerns quality indicators for diabetes management. A comparison is made between commonly used cross-sectional indicators and newly developed “sequential” indicators which shows {{the value of these}} new indicators. A systematic review on prescribing indicators is presented, describing different types of existing indicators and their validity. Furthermore, an overview of the quality of cardiometabolic risk factor management is given, showing contrasting results for the various indicators. The third part focuses on factors mentioned as reasons not to modify cardiometabolic treatment when indicated. Some of these, e. g. using higher thresholds than recommended, waiting for the next risk factor measurement, competing demands, and medication non-adherence were found to be related to treatment decisions for hypertension and hyperglycaemia. Polypharmacy, however, was not a factor of influence. This dissertation provides new methods of obtaining information from medical records for quality assessment and scientific research. Furthermore, the usefulness of <b>sequential</b> <b>indicators</b> for quality assessment is shown.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Spatially {{explicit}} error {{budgets are}} being developed for a process gap-phase forest dynamics model. An error budget is a comprehensive catalog of the different error sources in both surveys and models. When there are errors, it is not intuitive how all these errors propagating through the modeling system will influence final predictions and their uncertainties. The uncertainties due to these errors can also be quite different for small and large areas. Error budgets can help in assessing how various errors propagate through a monitoring/modeling system. They also provide a means for the systematic improvement of a model and its inputs. Practical uses of error-budgets include data correction, model evaluation, quality control, and decision-making with uncertainty, error management, etc. As {{the first part of}} developing the spatial error budgets, the spatial inputs for a gap model need to be properly represented in terms of input uncertainty.

Observations {{in the vicinity}} of wildland fires are needed to better understand fire-atmosphere interactions and to provide data for the evaluation of coupled fire-atmosphere models. An observational study was conducted during a low-intensity prescribed fire in an area of complex terrain with grass fuels east of San José, California. A ground-based scanning Doppler lidar acquired radial wind velocities and backscatter intensity in and around the fire plume from multiple horizontal and vertical scans. The development of a convergence zone was consistently observed to exist downwind of the plume and was indicated by a decrease in radial velocity of 3 – 5 m s− 1. Divergence calculations made from the lidar radial velocities showed that the magnitude of convergence ranged between − 0. 06 and − 0. 08 s− 1 downwind of the plumes, while a maximum of − 0. 14 s− 1 occurred within the plume near the fire front. Increased radial velocities were observed at the plume boundary, indicating fire-induced acceleration of the wind into the base of the convection column above the fire front.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} tiled map {{procedure}} enabling <b>sequential</b> <b>indicator</b> simulation on grids consisting of several {{tens of millions}} of cells, without putting excessive memory requirements. Spatial continuity across map tiles is handled by conditioning adjacent tiles on their shared boundaries. Tiles across the area can be characterized by dissimilar models of spatial continuity (semi-variograms) thus relieving the requirement of a global stationarity decision. Additionally, the approach provides a simple mechanism for reseeding the pseudo random number generator. Implementation of the algorithm involved small modifications to a GSLIB program and Bash and awk scripting. The software was stable on several platforms, including 32 -bit systems with a 4 Gb memory addressing limit. In an experiment we simulated 25 realizations of a 11, 274 × 13, 000 grid representing local uncertainty in the Dutch land cover at 25 m resolution. With the objective of mimicking the typical absence of well-distributed hard reference data, the simulations were only conditioned on local prior class probabilities and semi-variograms.

40|$|The {{problem of}} the current stage of public service field {{reforming}} {{is defined as the}} inadequate quality of their provision. Works by V. Rach and T. Mamatova are dedicated to solving the tasks of public administration, where a conceptual model of defining the development vector for the social and economic system is proposed as a methodological tool for academic research. V. Kyzyma proposed to consider the Worldwide Governance Indicators as an international indicator for the information support of the quality assessment of public services in countries as part of the Government Effectiveness index (Good Governance indicator). The aim of the article is to define the development vector for the public service provision system in Ukraine using the WGI international rating system with the involvement of the conceptual model of defining the development vector for the social and economic system proposed by V. Rach and T. Mamatova. The aggregate and individual good governance indicators of countries for the period of 1996 to 2013 are grouped based on the findings of the study conducted by the authors of the article using the information system presented on the Worldwide Governance Indicator website as the WGI Project. The analysis of the change in the rating position of Ukraine showed the interdependence of good governance indicators with the Regulatory Quality, Control of Corruption and Government Effectiveness indicators proving to be the most influential. Moreover, stages where this interdependence can be traced were singled out. The <b>sequential</b> dependence of <b>indicators</b> manifested itself most evidently in the IV period (2005 to 2009). The results for other periods do not run contrary to the hypothesis either. The peculiarities of defining the development vector of public administration in Ukraine are defined using the conceptual model proposed by V. Rach and T. Mamatova as an approach to defining the movement vector of a social and economic system, which consists of five stages: - predicting the state of the benchmarking system: the public administration system of the European Union countries, 2020. Characteristic features (the service provision  function of public administration); the basic success indicator of public administration is good governance); - determining the borderline figures of the future state of the united system: the results of the Worldwide Governance Indicator (WGI) global international studies using the methods of The World Bank; - outlining the reference area: the figures of the European Union member countries. The Governance Matters indicator, particularly {{in the form of a}} rating by the Government Effectiveness index; - assessing the current state of the system: the Governance Matters indicator determined by the ratings of Ukraine in 2013 by the Government Effectiveness index (the 30 th position); - directing the movement vector of the system: to define the basic provisions of the political direction of development concerning the direction of the movement vector of Ukraine, the task of studying the compliance of the implementation of the public administration function in Ukraine with international norms and established practices. It is proven in the article that the premises of the basic function of public administration being that of service provision and that it will characterize the economic and administrative space in 2010 to 2015 as well still remain topical. A study concerning good governance assessment (according to the figures of WGI) allowed to put forward a hypothesis that the calculation indexes of good governance assessment have a distinct sequential dependence for Ukraine, thus it is appropriate to study them as a whole. The peculiarities of defining the development vector of the public service provision system in Ukraine using the WGI international rating system with the involvement of the conceptual model of defining the development vector of the social and economic system are also characterized...|$|R
40|$|Forecasting coal {{resources}} and reserves {{is critical for}} coal mine development. Thickness maps are commonly used for assessing coal {{resources and}} reserves; however they are limited for capturing coal splitting effects in thick and heterogeneous coal zones. As an alternative, three-dimensional geostatistical methods are used to populate facies distributionwithin a densely drilled heterogeneous coal zone in the As Pontes Basin (NWSpain). Coal distribution in this zone is mainly characterized by coal-dominated areas in the central parts of the basin interfingering with terrigenous-dominated alluvial fan zones at the margins. The three-dimensional models obtained are applied to forecast coal resources and reserves. Predictions using subsets of the entire dataset are also generated to understand the performance of methods under limited data constraints. Three-dimensional facies interpolation methods tend to overestimate coal resources and reserves due to interpolation smoothing. Facies simulation methods yield similar resource predictions than conventional thickness map approximations. Reserves predicted by facies simulation methods are mainly influenced by: a) the specific coal proportion threshold used {{to determine if a}} block can be recovered or not, and b) the capability of the modelling strategy to reproduce areal trends in coal proportions and splitting between coal-dominated and terrigenousdominated areas of the basin. Reserves predictions differ between the simulation methods, even with dense conditioning datasets. Simulation methods can be ranked according to the correlation of their outputs with predictions from the directly interpolated coal proportion maps: a) with low-density datasets <b>sequential</b> <b>indicator</b> simulation with trends yields the best correlation, b) with high-density datasets <b>sequential</b> <b>indicator</b> simulation with post-processing yields the best correlation, because the areal trends are provided implicitly by the dense conditioning data...|$|E
