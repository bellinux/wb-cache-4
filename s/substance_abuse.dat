The results show that there are differences in experiences and reasons for <b>substances</b> <b>abuse</b> by students from different study years. Fourth-year students do not use ecstasy, but they have tried it because they wanted to experiment or out of boredom. They do not use heroin and they have not tried marijuana unlike students from other years. Such indicators show a relatively favourable situation of <b>substances</b> <b>abuse</b> among students from the oldest group of examinees, especially when it is the first-year students who have the furthest experiences and reasons from the ones mentioned.

40|$|Herpes simplex virus {{infection}} is mostly spread and occurs more commonly among <b>substance</b> <b>abusing</b> adolescents {{as compared to}} the nonsubstance abusing. In this paper, a mathematical model for the spread of HSV- 2 within a community with <b>substance</b> <b>abusing</b> adolescents is developed and analysed. The impacts of condom use and educational campaigns are examined. The study suggests that condom use is highly effective among adolescents, when we have more of them quitting than becoming substance abusers. Measures such as educational campaigns can be put in place to try and reduce adolescents from becoming substance abusers. Further, we applied optimal control theory to the proposed model. The controls represent condom use and educational campaigns. The objective is based on maximising the susceptible nonsubstance abusing adolescents, while minimising the susceptible <b>substance</b> <b>abusing</b> adolescents, the infectious nonsubstance abusing adolescents, and the infectious <b>substance</b> <b>abusing</b> adolescents. We used Pontrygin’s maximum principle to characterise the optimal levels of the two controls. The resulting optimality system is solved numerically. Overall, the application of the optimal control theory suggests that more effort should be devoted to condom use as compared to educational campaigns...|$|R

40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this {{research}} study was to fill large gaps in the knowledge base of social workers concerning <b>substance</b> <b>abusing</b> hospitalized teenagers.

The targeted population for the study included adolescents ages ranging from 13 to 17 years old, who experiences all of the psychosocial and ecological factors related to adolescent drug use. The type of research employed was an exploratory descriptive study, designed to investigate two issues: (1) peer pressure and (2) self-esteem of the adolescents hospitalize and not hospitalized. A questionnaire was administered to 10 males and 10 females, each from a treatment facility and community church. The researcher hypothesized that there is {{no significant difference in the}} self-esteem of adolescents who are hospitalized and not hospitalized and that there 2 ̆ 7 s no significant difference in peer pressure among hospitalized <b>substance</b> <b>abusing</b> teenagers and non-hospitalized teenagers.

40|$|Children {{raised in}} <b>substance</b> <b>abusing</b> {{families}} show {{high rates of}} behavioural and emotional problems, in particular oppositional, defiant and non-compliant behaviours. While a range of social and individual factors correlate with poor parenting, it is often {{the quality of the}} parent-child relationship that mediates the effects of most other risk factors on child development. By addressing this relationship using behavioural family interventions, child behaviour problems have been reduced in multiple problem families. However, there has been little attempt to systematically evaluate such programs in <b>substance</b> <b>abusing</b> families. It is argued that methadone replacement programs provide a window of opportunity to deliver well-validated parent training programs that enhance the quality of parent-child relations. However, it is likely that such programs would need to be medium to long term and address issues beyond parent child relationships. How such interventions may be delivered and evaluated is discussed.
