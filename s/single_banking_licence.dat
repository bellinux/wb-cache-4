50|$|National Australia Bank {{acquired}} Clydesdale Bank in 1987 and Yorkshire Bank in 1995. Fred Goodwin, {{an accountant}} working for Touche Ross, {{worked on the}} acquisition of Clydesdale Bank. In 1995 Goodwin, with little direct banking experience, was appointed deputy CEO of the Clydesdale Bank. Clydesdale and Yorkshire began operating under a <b>single</b> <b>banking</b> <b>licence</b> in the UK in 2005: Yorkshire became a division of Clydesdale but retained its own name for trading purposes.|$|E
50|$|The new {{generation}} pan-European bank concept {{is based on}} the <b>single</b> <b>banking</b> <b>licence</b> rule (single EU passport), which authorizes a credit institution to offer services in other EU member states. The full expansion plan envisaged launching mBank in eight countries in two years {{on the basis of the}} single EU passport. In the following months after the launch, mBank grew quicker in the Czech Republic than it had ever done in Poland. The new bank was recognized by experts and customers alike who awarded it the highest distinctions of Zlata Koruna in the Czech Republic and Zlata Minca in Slovakia in recognition of the mKonto (personal account). In the years to come, mBank was regarded as the most dynamically growing bank in those countries. mBank now is Top5 bank in both countries in terms of number of customers.|$|E
40|$|The {{theme of}} the thesis is {{entering}} the banking industry in the Czech Republic, fulfilling the basic requirements for obtaining a bank licence and the issues of its cancelling {{as well as the}} options of entering the industry via the <b>single</b> <b>banking</b> <b>licence.</b> Since the Czech Republic joined the European Union as of 1 st May 2004, the foreign credit institutions are allowed to operate via the <b>single</b> <b>banking</b> <b>licence</b> in the Czech Republic. The Czech National Bank deals with a number of foreign institutions aspiring to enter the Czech financial market every year. The Czech financial subjects, that intend to run their business in other countries of the European Union, can also make use of <b>single</b> <b>banking</b> <b>licence...</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{deregulation}} of financial {{services in the}} European Union (EU), together {{with the establishment of}} the Economic and Monetary Union, aimed at the creation of a level playing-field in the provision of banking services across the EU. The plan was to remove entry barriers and to foster both competition and efficiency in national banking markets. However, one {{of the effects of the}} regulatory changes was to spur a trend towards consolidation, resulting in the recent wave of mergers and acquisitions. To investigate the impact of increased consolidation on the competitive conditions of the EU banking markets, we employ both structural (concentration ratios) and non-structural (Panzar-Rosse statistic) concentration measures. Using bank-level balance sheet data for the major EU banking markets, in a period following the introduction of the <b>Single</b> <b>Banking</b> <b>Licence</b> (1997 - 2003), this paper also investigates the factors that may influence the competitive conditions. Specifically, we control for differences in efficiency estimates, structural conditions and institutional characteristics. The results seem to suggest that the degree of concentration is not necessarily related to the degree of competition. We also find little evidence that more efficient banking systems are also more competitive. The relationship between competition and efficiency is not a straightforward one: increased competition has forced banks to become more efficient but increased efficiency does not seem to be fostering more competitive EU banking systems.
