5000|$|Another set of {{quadrilateral}} {{roots in}} modern Hebrew is {{the set of}} secondary roots. A <b>secondary</b> <b>root</b> is a root derived from word that was derived from another root.

50|$|Normally the {{seedling}} radicle (root) emerges {{first from}} the seed, and the shoot appears as the root becomes established. Later, with {{growth of the}} shoot (particularly when it emerges into the light) there is increased <b>secondary</b> <b>root</b> formation and branching. In this coordinated progression of developmental responses are early manifestations of correlative growth phenomena where the root affects {{the growth of the}} shoot and vice versa. To a large degree, the growth responses are hormone mediated.|$|E
50|$|Root {{symptoms}} {{are similar to}} those caused by all nematodes including a reduction in number of feeder roots and root stunting, but root knot nematodes cause unique symptoms on roots and pods. Nematodes cause galls (knots) to form on both roots and pods of the peanut, and these galls are highly diagnostic for root-knot nematode presence compared to other nematodes affecting peanut. The presence of galls on roots, pegs and pods appears as single or multiple wart-like growths {{that may or may not}} be discolored. As root knot nematode infection progresses, and generally later in the season, <b>secondary</b> <b>root</b> and pod rots cause further damage and eventual death of the plants.|$|E

50|$|Herbchronology is the {{analysis}} of annual growth rings (or simply annual rings) in the <b>secondary</b> <b>root</b> xylem of perennial herbaceous plants. While leaves and stems of perennial herbs die {{down at the end}} of the growing season the root often persists for many years or even the entire life. Perennial herb species belonging to the dicotyledon group (also known as perennial forbs) are characterized by secondary growth, which shows as a new growth ring added each year to persistent roots. About two thirds of all perennial dicotyledonous herb species with a persistent root that grow in the strongly seasonal zone of the northern hemisphere show at least fairly clear annual growth rings.|$|E
50|$|Root canal anatomy {{consists}} of the pulp chamber and root canals. Both contain the dental pulp. The smaller branches, referred to as accessory canals, are most frequently found near the root end (apex), but may be encountered anywhere along the root length. The total number of root canals per tooth depends {{on the number of}} the tooth roots ranging from one to four, five or more in some cases. Sometimes there are more than one root canal per root. Some teeth have a more variable internal anatomy than others. An unusual root canal shape, complex branching (especially the existence of horizontal branches), and multiple root canals are considered as the main causes of root canal treatment failures. (e.g. If a <b>secondary</b> <b>root</b> canal goes unnoticed by the dentist and is not cleaned and sealed, it will remain infected, causing the root canal therapy to fail).|$|E
50|$|When the {{immature}} female penetrates the root, {{a feeding}} tube forms from stylet secretions. Nematode infestation can cause symptoms in the plant that resemble those of moisture and nutrient deficiencies. It causes hypertrophy in the pericycle cells of seedling roots and in the periderm cells of the roots of older plants. Root growth slows and <b>secondary</b> <b>root</b> development is limited. Root necrosis has been observed in pineapple and banana. Shoot growth suppression and reduction of fruit quality has been observed in crops such as pineapple. Infested plants can become stunted and chlorotic. Wilt disease can follow when opportunistic fungi such as Fusarium and Verticillium infect the plants, a process observed in cotton. Secondary fungal infection can also cause root decay. Damage from R. reniformis {{is directly related to}} the number of nematodes present when the crop is planted. Variation among nematode populations, hosts, environmental conditions, and soil types may alter the threshold or economic injury level across the geographic distribution of the nematode.|$|E

This study was aimed to select and estimate genetic parameters of cocoa seedling on the half sibs families of DR 1, DR 2, ICS 60, DRC 15, BLC 4, DRC 16, KEE 2, ICS 13, KW 162, KW 163, PA 300, RCC 70, TSH 858, Sca 6 and Sca 12. Research {{was carried out in}} Kaliwining Experimental Station of Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute. Genetic parameter were estimated based on variance and covariance component of the variables of the number of leaf, stem height, stem girth, leaf acreage, the volume of fresh root, the length of <b>secondary</b> <b>root</b> and the length of primary root which assessed along seed growth till 90 day after planting. The result showed that most of the recorded variables perform high category of narrow sense heritability (h 2 > 0. 5). Stem girth, leaf acreage, volume of fresh root, length of <b>secondary</b> <b>root</b> and the length of primary root were assessed as the broad category of genetic variability (d 2 A > 2 Sed 2 A). Therefore, length of primary root and length of <b>secondary</b> <b>root</b> would be the main criterion for rootstock selection as their performance on broad category of genetic variability and high category of narrow sense heritability. Length of <b>secondary</b> <b>root</b> can be estimated based on the performance of stem girth (r = 0. 5 *) and leaf acreage (r = 0. 23 *) and the primary root can be stimated based on the performance of stem height (r = 0. 81 *) and leaf acreage (r = 0. 72 *). Based on positive selection of primary root lenght and negative selection of <b>secondary</b> <b>root</b> lenght it was identified that the families of KEE 2 and Sca 12 potentially would be good rootstock due to their long category of the primary root and short category of the <b>secondary</b> <b>root</b> that having characteristics of high water uptake and low vigor.

40|$|Harpagophytum procumbens DC [family: Pedaliaceae] {{is widely}} used in South African {{traditional}} medicine for the treatment, management and/or control {{of a variety of}} human ailments. Some traditional health practitioners of South Africa have claimed that H. procumbens <b>secondary</b> <b>root</b> is a useful obstetric remedy for induction or acceleration of labour, as well as for expulsion of retained placentas in pregnant women.

40|$|Plant soil {{compaction}} poses {{a serious problem}} to agriculture because it produces different types of changes in plant characteristics. No method has been implemented to date to use root morphological changes as indicators of {{soil compaction}} levels. Therefore, {{the aim of the}} present study was to evaluate whether or not the morphological changes in root apexes of soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) can be used as indicators of soil compaction levels. To this end, a silt-loamy soil material (from a Typic Argiudoll, Esperanza series), sieved through a 2 mm mesh was used and the following soil bulk density levels were determined: 1. 1, 1. 3 and 1. 5 g cm³ for which the corresponding mechanical resistances were < 0. 1, 0. 5 and 3. 5 MPa, respectively. The distance from the apex to the first tertiary root and the root diameter at 1. 5 cm from the apex were measured on the <b>secondary</b> <b>root</b> apexes. A form factor equal to the quotient between these two variables was subsequently calculated. An inverse relationship between soil mechanical impedance and <b>secondary</b> <b>root</b> length and form factor as well as a direct relationship with the <b>secondary</b> <b>root</b> diameter were observed. Changes in rhizodermis cells were also recorded. The following morphological characteristics were found to evidence the highest sensitivity to soil compaction: i) the form factor, ii) rhizodermis papillose cells, iii) apical malformations in root hairs, and iv) root diameter in expansion areas. Taken together, the morphological characteristics of root apexes could be considered to be indicative of soil compaction...|$|E

40|$|En pruebas preliminares de germinación con semillas de Garcinia {{intermedia}} (Clusiaceae) se observó que ésta producía dos tipos de raíces: la primaria y una secundaria embrional que atraviesa longitudinalmente la semilla. Para determinar su posible papel en la supervivencia y crecimiento de esta especie, se analizaron 90 plántulas con {{al menos}} seis meses de germinadas en bolsas plásticas con suelo orgánico ubicadas en un invernadero, a las que se les aplicó uno de los siguientes tratamientos: corte de la raíz primaria o la secundaria embrional, además de un grupo control con ambas raíces (30 repeticiones de cada uno). Luego de tres meses se empezaron a extraer 10 plántulas/mes/tratamiento a los que se les midió la altura total, diámetro basal, longitud de la raíz primaria y secundaria, y la biomasa del vástago, raíz y semilla sin la cubierta seminal. Las plántulas que obtuvieron el mayor crecimiento fueron las del control, seguidas por aquéllas sin la raíz secundaria. Sin embargo, más del 90 % de las plántulas a las que se les cortó la raíz primaria, sobrevivieron después de cinco meses de haberse aplicado el tratamiento, en parte debido a una muy alta capacidad de recuperación de su sistema radical, ya sea produciendo rebrotes de la principal (20 %), aumentando el crecimiento de la raíz secundaria (13. 3 %), o ambos (26. 7 %), y a las reservas de la semilla. La longitud de los rebrotes de la raíz principal fue estadísticamente significativa en las primeras dos extracciones mensuales de plantas, comparado con las del control (F 6 = 18. 6, F 7 = 16. 0, p Secondary embryonary root associated with seed germination in Garcinia intermedia (Clusiaceae) and its possible role in seedling survival. Germination tests on Garcinia intermedia (Clusiaceae) seeds showed {{the growth of}} two types of roots: additionally to the primary root, a <b>secondary</b> <b>root</b> crosses the seed lengthwise. To determine its possible role on the survival and growth of this species, 90 seedlings {{at least six months}} old (collected in Central Costa Rica) were planted in plastic bags with organic soil, and placed in a greenhouse. The seedlings were treated as follows: treatments in which the primary or <b>secondary</b> <b>root</b> was cut off, and a control group with both roots intact (30 replicates each). After three months 10 seedlings/month/treatment were extracted to measure their height, basal diameter, root length (main and <b>secondary</b> <b>root),</b> and biomass of the stem, roots and seed (without its coat). Control seedlings had the highest growth, followed by those without secondary roots. Nonetheless, more than 90 % of the seedlings whose primary roots were cut off, survived after five months of the excision treatment, in part due to the capacity of this species to regenerate its radical system through the seed reserves, sprouting of a primary-like root, and/or the growth stimulus of the <b>secondary</b> <b>root</b> (60 % of the total: 20 % with sprouts from the primary root stump, 13. 3 % with a growth stimulus of the <b>secondary</b> <b>root,</b> and 26. 7 % with both conditions).
