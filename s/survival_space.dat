40|$|December 2006. "Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. Today transit buses are an {{integral}} part of the national transportation system. According to National Transportation Statistics from 1990 to 2002, the number of transit motor buses in the U. S. has increased 30 percent. Although buses are one of the safest means of transportation, occupant injuries and fatalities in bus crashes do occur. Rollover strength has become an important issue for bus and coach manufacturers. Today European regulation “ECE-R 66 ” is in force to prevent catastrophic rollover accidents. The Standard Bus Procurement Guidelines (SBPG) of the American Public Transit Association (APTA) also mentions the roof crush test for the assessment of bus superstructure and roof. This thesis discusses the development of a finite element (FE) model of a bus, and the analysis of its roof crush and rollover in LS-DYNA. The FE model was validated for the roof crush test carried according to the standard bus procurement guidelines (SBPG). ADAMS-View software was used to simulate the rollover of the bus. Bus accelerations, velocities, and its angle with the ground just before impact were measured in ADAMS and then used as input for the LSDYNA analysis. According to the ECE-R 66 regulation, a passenger’s <b>survival</b> <b>space</b> is defined in the bus model to check whether there is any intrusion into the <b>survival</b> <b>space</b> during or after the rollover. This ensures that the bus structure has sufficient strength to avoid intrusions into the <b>survival</b> <b>space.</b> The effect of passengers’ weight on energy absorbed by the bus structures during rollover is also discussed. Development of the MADYMO bus model and its rollover simulations were also included in this research. Dummy kinematics and injuries sustained during rollover for various seated and standing positions were studied as well...|$|E

40|$|International audienceOriginating {{in rural}} areas, the popular {{uprising}} {{that led to}} the Tunisian revolution of 14 January 2011 has shed light on the growing social and regional disparities that have characterized development dynamics in Tunisia. While favouring the reallocation of resources to coastal areas to the detriment of interior and agricultural regions, liberalization processes since the late 1980 s also fostered export-oriented agricultural development strategies, based on the promotion of large-scale agricultural enterprises and irrigated farming. As a result, imports of grains and animal feed have come to represent a growing source of commercial balance deficit and of financial pressure on public budgets, particularly since the food crisis of 2008. On the other hand, decreasing farm subsidies, higher production costs, growing farmers' indebtedness, have importantly reduced the reproduction capacity of a large fraction of farms, particularly in the rain-fed agriculture sector. As rural outmigration and non-farm employment opportunities have been declining, small farms have become <b>survival</b> <b>spaces</b> for jobless household members, increasing the pressure on family resources and exacerbating social frustrations. While rising food prices were not the only cause of recent uprisings in Tunisia, processes of agricultural restructuring during the past 20 years contributed importantly to fuel the revolutionary dynamics, thus giving a political dimension to food issues. As demonstrated by the rise of farmers' protest movement (land occupations, contestation of farmers unions, refusal to pay for irrigation water), structural change allowing for an increased control of economic resources by local farm producers is needed, but will fundamentally depend on the effectiveness of current process of 'democratic' transition in Tunisia...|$|R

Nairne et al. found that processing words in terms of survival relevance yielded the best memory retention compared to other deep processing conditions. The {{purpose of the present}} research was to investigate whether factors including a feeling of isolation or novelty could explain the adaptive memory advantage observed in previous adaptive memory research. In two incidental learning experiments, participants rated word relevance in one of four conditions: grasslands <b>survival,</b> <b>space</b> mission, alien abduction, or moving. In Experiment 1, participants rated 32 unrelated words. In Experiment 2, participants rated 60 words from six DRM lists. In Experiment 1 there was one incidental free recall test whereas in Experiment 2 three successive free recall tests were employed. As hypothesized, results from Experiment 1 indicated that the grasslands survival scenario, space mission, and alien conditions had similar rates in recall. The typical adaptive memory effect was also found in which participants in the grasslands survival scenario condition had significantly higher recall compared to participants who received the moving scenario condition. Experiment 2 found that all of the conditions did not significantly differ from each in terms of true or false recall. Across both experiments, the grasslands <b>survival,</b> <b>space</b> mission, and alien abduction scenarios were rated similarly in terms of isolation and novelty. These findings suggest that novelty and isolation can be contributing factors in the memory advantage observed with the grasslands survival scenario in previous adaptive memory studies...|$|E

The model considers discrete space and continuous time. Work also summarizes the necessary theory of individually oriented models Poisson processes. The results show that in terms of survival populations is good that individuals move slowly, and only a short distance. Easily clump together and the population survives on less initial numbers of males and females.

(2011), competition for <b>survival</b> <b>space</b> in the host’s hemocoel and food resources was evident revealing that Xenorhabdus bovienii and B. bassiana are antagonistic; this interaction occurs because the nematode is considered more virulent. The nematode achieves faster colonization because of its active dispersion; it enters the larvae within 24  h, whereas the fungi take 2 – 3  days. It should be noted that, once the fungus penetrates the host, the bacterial symbiont is in its exponential phase producing primary and secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activity (Molina et al. 2007; Tarasco et al. 2011).
