60|$|Several boats hurtled {{past them}} in the next half-hour,--small boats, boats of their own size, boats afraid, unable to do aught but run madly on. Then a ten-ton barge, at {{imminent}} risk of destruction, lowered <b>sail</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward</b> and lumbered down upon them.|$|E
60|$|Still, {{the work}} roused and warmed him, and he toiled on, {{battered}} and almost blinded by flying brine, while {{he wondered how}} long the boat would stand the pressure of her largely reduced sail. He did not think they could tie another reef in, because it seemed certain that something must burst or break the moment a rope was started. Besides, even had it been possible, reefing {{was out of the}} question. Their harbor lay to weather, and a boat will not <b>sail</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward</b> in a vicious breeze unless she is driven at a speed which is greater than the resistance of the opposing seas.|$|E
60|$|He {{sat down}} to rest a minute, and looked about for the dory. He made her out indistinctly, but she seemed a long {{distance}} off, and as the breeze was freshening {{he did not know}} whether she could overtake the sloop. By setting some canvas he could pick her up, and the foresail would not be hard to hoist; but the Cetacea would not <b>sail</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward</b> with the heavy cable hanging from her bows. Jimmy remembered that there was a good length of it below; indeed, there might be scope enough to allow him to drop several fathoms on the bottom. The weight of this would act as a drag, and might, perhaps, bring her up. It depended on the depth of water.|$|E
5000|$|The stiff junk battens disturb laminar wind flow {{over the}} sail -especially {{important}} when <b>sailing</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward,</b> or a point free.|$|R
50|$|Centre board - (also dagger board) an {{elongated}} underwater appendage that fits vertically {{in the slot}} of a centre case and extends below the hull. It can be retracted so the boat can float in very shallow water. The board has a length to breadth ratio of about 4;1. The board is tapered to a hydrodynamic (teardrop) shape in plan section to promote laminar flow of the water. This shape prevents stalling or eddying when <b>sailing</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward.</b> Together with the sails it lifts the hull in the windward direction. Common materials are wood often reinforced with fibreglass or carbon to obtain more stiffness and abrasion resistance. When <b>sailing</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward</b> the board is fully down but is retracted about half way when sailing directly down wind. When <b>sailing</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward</b> an efficient board prevents most leeway (sideways movement).|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A 19'6" [...] Phil Bolger-designed bald-headed knockabout {{schooner}} Shrike <b>sailing</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward</b> on port tack, near Kingston Ontario. The specific {{design is}} known as the [...] "His and Her" [...] or [...] "Singlehanded" [...] schooner.|$|R
60|$|We were, however, pretty long in resolving, and hankered {{about the}} Rio de la Plata a long time. At last we spied a <b>sail</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward,</b> {{and it was}} such a sail as I believe had not been seen {{in that part of the}} world a great while. It wanted not that we should give it chase, for it stood {{directly}} towards us, as well as they that steered could make it; and even that was more accident of weather than anything else, for if the wind had chopped about anywhere they must have gone with it. I leave any man that is a sailor, or understands anything of a ship, to judge what a figure this ship made when we first saw her, and what we could imagine was the matter with her. Her maintop-mast was come by the board about six foot above the cap, and fell forward, the head of the topgallant-mast hanging in the fore-shrouds by the stay; at the same time the parrel of the mizzen-topsail-yard by some accident giving way, the mizzen-topsail-braces (the standing part of which being fast to the main-topsail shrouds) brought the mizzen-topsail, yard and all, down with it, which spread over part of the quarter-deck like an awning; the fore-topsail was hoisted up two-thirds of the mast, but the sheets were flown; the fore-yard was lowered down upon the forecastle, the sail loose, and part of it hanging overboard. In this manner she came down upon us with the wind quartering. In a word, the figure the whole ship made was the most confounding to men that understood the sea that ever was seen. She had no boat, neither had she any colours out.|$|E
50|$|Many of {{the cabin}} {{interiors}} are designed to flexy-space principles, the concept being multi-purpose space on a human scale, in which less is more and the simpler the construction, the better. The slim v-shaped hulls {{have a very good}} speed/length ratio and all have canoe sterns, giving minimum drag, even when loaded. This hullshape requires no keels or boards to <b>sail</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward,</b> giving hulls with little draft and easy beachability. Wharram also keeps freeboards low for minimum windage.|$|E
5000|$|... the schooner, {{characterized}} by a two or three mast configuration, with the smallest mast forward and the main mast aft. The schooner rig is suitable for larger boats because it breaks down the sail into smaller canvas which is easier to handle. Some hybrid schooner rigs exist, for example the Colvin rig, which combine a fore-and-aft jib sail with junk-rigged main and fore sails. It is sometimes asserted that this improves the rig's ability to <b>sail</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward.</b>|$|E
25|$|Under Bowers' command Esther <b>sailed</b> <b>to</b> the <b>Windward</b> Coast <b>to</b> gather slaves, {{and then}} {{delivered}} her slaves to Jamaica.|$|R
50|$|Settees had two lateen-rigged masts, like xebecs or galleys, but {{carrying}} settee sails. They <b>sailed</b> well <b>to</b> <b>windward</b> {{and could}} <b>sail</b> downwind. Some polaccas carried a settee <b>sail,</b> giving rise <b>to</b> the polacca-settee (or polacre-settee).|$|R
50|$|Tell-tales are {{pieces of}} yarn, thread or tape that are affixed <b>to</b> <b>sails</b> <b>to</b> help {{visualize}} airflow over their surfaces. Typically, they are mounted near the luff of sails, {{but they are}} also found on the leach on some <b>sails.</b> <b>To</b> <b>windward,</b> a sagging tell-tale indicates still air, either from stalling (indicated on the leeward side, when the sail is sheeted in too far, compared to the apparent wind) or pinching (indicated on the windward side, when the sail isn't sheeted in far enough, compared to the apparent wind).|$|R
50|$|When a sloop is hove to, the jib is backed. This {{means that}} its {{windward}} sheet is tight holding the <b>sail</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward.</b> The mainsail sheet is often eased, or the mainsail reefed, to reduce forward movement, or 'fore-reaching'. The rudder is placed so that, should the boat make any forward movement, {{it will be}} turned into the wind, so as to prevent forward momentum building up. In a centerboard boat the centerboard will be partially raised and the tiller held down hard.|$|E
50|$|Nicholson did {{not receive}} his {{cruising}} orders until the following spring. Late in May 1780, Trumbull sailed for her first foray into the Atlantic. Action was not long in coming. At 1030 on 1 June 1780, Trumbulls masthead lookout sighted a <b>sail</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward.</b> In order to remain undetected {{for as long as}} possible, the frigate furled her sails until 1130. Then, upon ascertaining the strange ship's size, Trumbull then made sail and tacked towards, what soon proved to be the British letter-of-marque Watt, of 32 guns.|$|E
50|$|These boats sailed {{best with}} the wind on the quarter or just aft of the beam. Since the sails are fully battened and may be set almost at a right angle to the boat, {{they were able to}} set the Topan <b>sail</b> <b>to</b> <b>{{windward}},</b> sailing wing to wing as soon as the wind was well aft of the beam. Going to windward was not the strong point of those junk rigged vessels, since the junk rig performs not as efficiently to windward as the modern Bermuda sail or the Gaff sail and the hulls of the cargo freighters were well rounded and offered not much lateral resistance.|$|E
50|$|The {{race between}} Ariel and Anglona was about 40 mi., from Macao Roads around Lintin and back, for stakes of $1,000 and Forbesâ€™ {{agreement}} to take half-interest in Ariel if she won. Anglona was much stronger <b>sailing</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward,</b> due <b>to</b> the shallow draft of Ariel, {{and took the}} lead until rounding the island. At that point, Ariel set a large flying square sail and topsail. Anglona had no ballooning sails for running downwind, and was beaten by 17 minutes.|$|R
60|$|The {{remainder}} of the day, and {{the whole of the}} succeeding night, were passed with much anxiety, by the governor and his friends. Time was given to receive an answer to the messages sent across to the Reef, but nothing was seen of the strangers, when day returned. The boat that came in from the Reef, reported that the coast was clear to the northward. It also brought a letter, stating that notices had been sent to all the different settlements, and that the Anne had <b>sailed</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward,</b> <b>to</b> call in all the fishermen, and to go off to the nearest whaling-ground, in order to communicate the state of things in the colony to Captain Betts and his companions, who were out. The Dragon and the Jonas, when last heard from, were cruising only about a hundred miles <b>to</b> <b>windward</b> of the group, and it was thought important, on various accounts, that they should be at once apprised of the arrival of the strangers.|$|R
50|$|Use of the {{centerboard}} {{is optional}} at all points of <b>sail,</b> but <b>to</b> <b>windward</b> putting the centerboard down {{will improve the}} steering balance. With the centerboard up, the Wanderer {{is one of the}} shallowest-draft keel boats in its size range.|$|R
25|$|Cunninghams, which {{tighten the}} luff of a boom-footed sail by pulling {{downward}} on a cringle in the luff of a mainsail above the tack. The {{idea is to}} flatten the main sail in heavier weather or when <b>sailing</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward.</b> In its simplest form a stainless steel hook that goes through the cringle. From the hook a cordage tail passes through a turnblock on the deck {{at the base of}} the mast and back to a cleat on the deck. Often the tail is split so the cunningham can be operated from either sidedeck in a racing dinghy.|$|R
60|$|But {{all this}} {{had nothing to}} do with her sailing; at that, brave Little Jule, plump Little Jule, was a witch. Blow high, or blow low, she was always ready for the breeze; and when she dashed the waves from her prow, and pranced, and pawed the sea, you never thought of her patched sails and {{blistered}} hull. How the fleet creature would fly before the wind! rolling, now and then, to be sure, but in very playfulness. <b>Sailing</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward,</b> no gale could bow her over: with spars erect, she looked right up into the wind's eye, and so she went.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will throw}} her {{up into the}} wind," [...] Ben said. [...] "Haul on the weather fore-sheet as I do, and belay it with {{the foot of the}} <b>sail</b> just <b>to</b> <b>windward</b> of the mast. Now rouse in the main-sheet. That is right." ...|$|R
50|$|Drua, {{also known}} as Na Drua, N'drua, Ndrua or Vaka Tepu (sacred canoe), is a double-hull sailing boat that {{originated}} in the south-western Pacific islands. Druas do not tack but rather shunt (stern becomes the bow and vice versa). Both ends of each hull are identical, but the hulls are of different sizes and the smaller one is always <b>sailed</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward.</b> The main differences compared to other Pacific proas, are that the hulls have a symmetric U-form profile, and a second hull is used instead of an outrigger. When a float (cama) is used {{in place of the}} smaller hull, the craft is called a Camakau (or Tamakau).|$|R
50|$|Though {{the first}} race was raced in light airs, {{thought to be}} Kookaburra's best conditions, Stars & Stripes 87 reached the first mark ahead. She led {{throughout}} the race, never being seriously threatened. This first test between the two boats was a harbinger of more to come. It was clear Stars & Stripes 87 had the edge in <b>sailing</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward,</b> even in light air, and could hold her own on the downwind legs. The Fremantle Doctor returned after the first match, and with the heavy winds came an even greater difference in boat speeds. The Aussies gave a great effort, but they simply lacked the boat speed to stay with Stars & Stripes 87, which showed a consistent twenty second advantage on each beat <b>to</b> <b>windward.</b> She won the series four races to nil.|$|R
5000|$|Stars & Stripes 87 {{was not a}} light weather boat, nor was she {{as quick}} in stays as either Kiwi Magic or Kookaburra III, but in the heavier winds off Fremantle she could outpace any {{challenger}} in straight-line <b>sailing</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward.</b> She was equally able to foot for pace <b>to</b> escape a <b>windward</b> cover, or point higher to power away from an opponent on her windward quarter. [...] Though both Kiwi Magic in the challenger finals and Kookaburra III in the Americaâ€™s Cup were sailed aggressively, the edge in boat speed held by Conner allowed him to overpower his competitors {{in a series of}} long drag races <b>to</b> the first <b>windward</b> mark. The challenger finalists and cup defenders were unable to engage him in a tactical race, where the quicker Kiwis and Kookaburras held the advantage. Said Conner: ...|$|R
40|$|The {{experimental}} {{evaluation of}} yacht performance with model yachts {{has been carried}} out in two different ways over the last sixty years. The physical modelling of a <b>sailing</b> vessel <b>sailing</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward</b> with a wuasi-static balance between aerodynamic and hydrodynamic forces {{has been carried out}} with either a free running model towed from a mast or with a captive model. In the former the physical modelling is perhaps more realistic, but it creates problems of measurement accuracy. In the later more precise measurements are possible even though the sailing condition is not rigorously modelled. The different approaches that have been used in each technique are reviewed and a comparison of {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the two techniques are discussed. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
5000|$|All boats {{competing}} underwent {{changes during}} the challenger and defender series, some successful, some not. [...] Changes made on Stars & Stripes 87 consistently resulted in steps forward in boat speed. This was largely thanks to Marshall, whose technical, sailmaking and organizational skills {{enabled him to}} coordinate {{a great deal of}} technical information. [...] The greatest increase occurred with the re-working of the boat's keel between the second and third round robins. [...] Close competitor Tom Blackaller felt the boat had found a 2/10 kn increase in Velocity made good when <b>sailing</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward</b> as she entered the third round robin. The final tweak was the application of a drag reducing shark skin like riblet covering, applied to the hull just prior to the challenger finals.|$|R
5000|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 28 April, several <b>sail</b> were sighted <b>to</b> <b>windward.</b> They belonged <b>to</b> a small convoy that had sailed from Havana on 23 April, escorted by the Epervier. When the convoy sighted Peacock the {{merchant}} ships made all <b>sail</b> <b>to</b> escape, while Epervier prepared to engage.|$|R
50|$|The scow in particular, in {{the form}} of the scow schooner, was the first {{significant}} example of a hard chine sailing vessel. While the squared off scow hulls were ugly to sailors accustomed to the sleek, rounded hulls of the time, a scow could carry far more cargo, and while a laden scow was slow and difficult <b>to</b> <b>sail,</b> when not heavily laden it would keep up with the traditional schooners <b>sailing</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward.</b> While <b>sailing</b> scows had a poor safety reputation, that was due more to their typical cheap construction and tendency to founder in storms. As long as it sailed in the protected inland and coastal waters it was designed to operate in, however, the sailing scow was an efficient and cost effective solution to transporting goods from inland sources to the coast. A good example of this is the gundalow.|$|R
5000|$|Fore-and-aft rig - A {{fore-and-aft sail}} {{is set for}} the wind on one side for a given tack. As the wind changes across the stern and reaches {{the other side of}} the sail, the sail may be blown to the other side suddenlyâ€”unless it is {{shielded}} by other <b>sails</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward.</b> If the <b>sail</b> is supported with a boom, gaff or sprit the change may be violentâ€”unless the sheets are tightâ€”as the <b>sail</b> is blown <b>to</b> the other side. For a jib, the old leeward sheet is loosened as the stern turns through the wind and the old windward sheet is tightened as the new leeward sheet <b>to</b> allow the <b>sail</b> <b>to</b> draw wind. A jib is usually shielded by the mainsail in this process. The mainsail sheet is tightened to limit the sudden movement from one side to the other and then eased out, once the boat is safely on the opposite tack. On smaller craft, the boom may be controlled by hand.|$|R
5000|$|Original Bermuda Dinghies were roundbottomed {{and fitted}} with long, shallow keels {{so they would}} be easy to beach or could run over reefs without damage. During the first {{recorded}} race, held in St. George's Harbour in 1853, the existing boats were fitted with deep keel extensions fastened in place temporarily to give them the bite <b>to</b> <b>sail</b> better <b>to</b> <b>windward.</b> These metal keels (called fans) differentiated these racing boats from the [...] "unfitted" [...] working dinghies and gave the class its name.|$|R
25|$|Commander the Honorable John Gore took {{command in}} April 1810 and {{returned}} Scorpion to the Leeward Islands. While she was <b>sailing</b> <b>to</b> the <b>windward</b> of Martinique, she encountered a heavy squall. The squall broke {{some of her}} masts and swept three seamen overboard. Gore saw them struggling and jumped into the sea to rescue them. He succeeded in rescuing two; the third man was exhausted from battling the waves and drowned.|$|R
50|$|Cutters {{were widely}} used by several navies in the 17th and 18th centuries and were usually the {{smallest}} commissioned {{ships in the}} fleet. As with cutters in general they were distinguished by their large fore-aft sail plans with multiple headsails, usually carried on a very long bowsprit, which was sometimes as long as half {{the length of the}} boat's hull. The rig gave the cutter excellent maneuverability and they were much better at <b>sailing</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward</b> than a larger square rigged ship. Larger naval cutters often had the ability to hoist two or three square-rigged sails from their mast to improve their downwind sailing performance as well. Navies used cutters for coastal patrol, customs duties, escort, carrying personnel and dispatches, and for small 'cutting out' raids. As befitted their size and intended role naval cutters, such as those of the Royal Navy), were lightly armed, often with between six and ten small cannon (or carronades).|$|R
40|$|Abstract A {{study of}} a boat's motion is carried out in order to analyze the {{aerodynamic}} properties of the optimal sail for obtaining the maximum velocity when <b>sailing</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward.</b> The mechanics study shows the optimal CL and CQ for a given sail and how {{the shape of the}} aerodynamic polar of the sail should be. A parametrical analysis of the aerodynamics of a sail is then carried out varying the maximum camber, position of the maximum camber in the chord direction and position of the maximum camber in the mast direction. The parametric analysis is done numerically with a vortex lattice method (VLM) and experimentally in a wind tunnel. The results show that the influence of the relevant parameters studied can be reduced to the variation of two parameters, A and B, defining the polar of the sail, Co = B + A 2 C^; and the influence of parameters A and B on the maximum VMG obtainable are calculated...|$|R
50|$|Two nights later, the French troops reembarked on the transports, and {{the fleet}} <b>sailed</b> off <b>to</b> the <b>windward</b> {{for several days}} before {{returning}} to Martinique on May 15. Troops numbering 3,000 were then embarked, and the fleet sailed for Tobago on May 25.|$|R
50|$|With {{the advent}} of steam-powered ships in the mid-19th century, {{conventions}} for sailing vessel navigation had to be supplemented with conventions for power-driven vessel navigation. Sailing vessels are limited as to their manoeuvrability in that they cannot <b>sail</b> directly <b>to</b> <b>windward</b> or into {{the eye of the}} wind and cannot be readily navigated in the absence of wind. On the other hand, steamships can manoeuvre in all 360 degrees of direction and can be manoeuvred irrespective of {{the presence or absence of}} wind.|$|R
50|$|Initially {{designs were}} heavy displacement, with a fine, often V shaped stern {{as well as}} a fine bow. These were {{powerful}} boats for <b>sailing</b> <b>to</b> <b>windward,</b> but had limited performance offwind as well as often having an alarming tendency to broach - designers included Sparkman & Stephens and Dick Carter. Then Ron Holland's quarter-tonner Eygthene began the next phase of increasingly lightweight boats with fuller sterns giving more of a wedge shape, and a change from masthead rig to a fractional rig. This dinghy influence gave much faster performance reaching and downwind, and although windward performance was not as good it improved as the designs developed. The ultimate in this stage was the various lightweight centerboard designs with internal ballast, but these were not sufficiently seaworthy for offshore racing and so were penalised so heavily that they were effectively banned. Designs then moved to a more moderate displacement, and as race courses moved from offshore racing with plenty of reaching towards windward/leeward round the cans racing designs became narrower and less powerful but more easily driven.|$|R
