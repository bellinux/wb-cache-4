40|$|Lanthanum cuprate(La 2 CuO 4) is an antiferromagnetic insulator, {{which becomes}} superconducting after {{introducing}} interstitial oxygen by high-pressure, chemical or electrochemical oxidation We report here the flux growth of superconducting single crystal in an ambient atmosphere, which the morphology is remarkably {{different from that}} of insulating crystal. The behavior of superconductivity is studied by AC-susceptibility measurement. A phase separation makes a strong effect on the superconductivity. The phase separation mainly occurs at the temperature range of 270 to 190 K and the separation is reversible in the solid state. Superconducting transition temperature (Tc) depends on the temperature, the time and the cooling process. Te reaches an equilibrium value after several hour treatment at constant temperature, which indicates the completion of the phase separation It increases to a higher value level only by 30 minute cooling from 260 to 230 K, which suggests the <b>stripe</b> <b>nucleation</b> and growth. A mechanism of the stripe formation is discussed based on the staging phase diagram of La 2 CuO 4 +delta. Parallel intergrowth of the oxygen-rich phase and the oxygen-poor phase takes place alternatively in the miscibility gap, in result of self-assembling a composite structure in the duplex single crystal...|$|E
40|$|The p-n {{junctions}} {{dynamics in}} graphene channel induced by <b>stripe</b> domains <b>nucleation,</b> motion and reversal in a ferroelectric substrate is explored using self-consistent approach based on Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire phenomenology combined with classical electrostatics. We revealed the extrinsic size {{effect in the}} dependence of the graphene channel conductivity on its length. For the case of perfect electric contact between the ferroelectric and graphene, relatively low gate voltages are required to induce the pronounced hysteresis of ferroelectric polarization and graphene charge {{in response to the}} periodic gate voltage. Pronounced nonlinear hysteresis of graphene conductance with a wide memory window corresponds to high amplitudes of gate voltage. We predict that the considered nano-structure "top gate/dielectric layer/graphene channel/ferroelectric substrate" can be a promising candidate for the fabrication of new generation of modulators and rectifiers based on the graphene p-n junctions.

40|$|Pendeoepitaxy on {{patterned}} templates {{has been}} proven to be efficient for reducing threading dislocation densities in GaN thin films. In this letter, we report on in situ crack-assisted pendeoepitaxy of GaN using spontaneously formed cracks in AlGaN∕GaNheterostructures. Our approach involves the growth of an AlGaN∕GaNtemplate followed by in situ thermal etching and deposition of an amorphous silicon nitride mask in a low pressure metal organic chemical vapor deposition system. Microwirelike GaN seeds are then formed along the crack lines during the initial stage of GaN overgrowth, which act as <b>nucleation</b> <b>stripes</b> for epitaxial lateral overgrowth. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that the lateral overgrowth of the wirelike GaN seeds effectively bends threading dislocations toward ⟨ 11 ¯ 00 ⟩ directions on the amorphous silicon nitride mask. The threading dislocation density by this method has been reduced from 2 × 109 cm− 2 in control samples to 2 × 108 cm− 2 in some parts and 5 × 107 cm− 2 {{in other parts of}} the GaN layer as determined by plan-view transmission electron microscopy which is very encouraging...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamical}} {{behavior of a}} square lattice Ising model with exchange and dipolar interactions by means of Monte Carlo simulations. After a sudden quench to low temperatures {{we find that the}} system may undergo a coarsening process where stripe phases with different orientations compete or alternatively it can relax initially to a metastable nematic phase and then decay to the equilibrium <b>stripe</b> phase through <b>nucleation.</b> We measure the distribution of equilibration times for both processes and compute their relative probability of occurrence as a function of temperature and system size. This peculiar relaxation mechanism is due to the strong metastability of the nematic phase, which goes deep in the low temperature stripe phase. We also measure quasi-equilibrium autocorrelations {{in a wide range of}} temperatures. They show a distinct decay to a plateau that we identify as due to a finite fraction of frozen spins in the nematic phase. We find indications that the plateau is a finite size effect. Relaxation times as a function of temperature in the metastable region show super-Arrhenius behavior, suggesting a possible glassy behavior of the system at low temperatures...|$|R
