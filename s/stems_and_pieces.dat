50|$|The {{success of}} the {{uprising}} in Bacolod was attributed to the low morale of the local Spanish detachment, due to its defeat in Panay and Luzon and to the psychological warfare waged by Generals Aniceto Lacson and Juan Araneta. In 1897, a battle in Bacolod was fought at Matab-ang River. A year later, on November 5, 1898, the Negrense Revolucionarios (Negrense Revolutionary Army), armed with knives, bolos, spears, and rifle-like nipa palm <b>stems,</b> <b>and</b> <b>pieces</b> of sawali or amakan mounted on carts, captured the convento (convent), presently Palacio Episcopal (Bishop's Palace), where Coronel (Colonel) Isidro de Castro y Cisneros, well-armed cazadores (hunters) and platoons of Guardias Civiles (Civil Guards), surrendered.|$|E
40|$|Canning {{tests were}} carried out on 5 {{mushroom}} strains from 2 flushes of 4 separate crops. Particular attention {{was given to the}} ratio of whole closed canned mushrooms to that of whole closed canned mushrooms plus canned <b>stems</b> <b>and</b> <b>pieces</b> - i. e. total yield. Factors considered in the tests included grading prior to processing, blanching and retort losses, shrinkage in size and mushroom whiteness. Cream and off-white strains had the highest level of open and misshapen mushrooms prior to processing and a brown strain the lowest. Blanching losses, which comprised shrinkage and mushrooms that opened during blanching, ranged from 37. 8 % for the cream strain to 22. 7 % for the brown strain. Values for shrinkage during blanching were similar for the 5 strains with a mean of 19. 2 % loss in weight. Shrinkage during retorting ranged from 15. 0 % for the off-white- 2 strain to 11. 4 % for the cream strain. Strains which showed a relatively low level of shrinkage during blanching had a relatively high shrinkage during retorting and combined shrinkage values for blanching and retorting were similar, ranging from 31. 5 to 34. 0 %. The brown strain gave the highest yield of whole closed canned mushrooms at 54. 8 % and the cream strain the lowest at 45. 0 %. Corresponding yields of canned <b>stems</b> <b>and</b> <b>pieces</b> were 16. 0 and 24. 8 % respectively. Total yield values for all strains were similar, ranging from 69. 7 % to 70. 8 %. Most shrinkage in mushroom size took place during blanching. Colour of the canned mushrooms of the 5 strains was considered acceptable by a sensory panel...|$|E
40|$|Induction {{and growth}} of callus from seeds, <b>stems</b> <b>and</b> <b>pieces</b> of leaf of Arabidopsis thaliana were {{successful}} on a Gamborg B 5 medium and on a modified B 5 medium (PG 2). Actively growing calluses have been obtained on agar and in liquid cultures. Cell suspension cultures were establiched on the same culture media, with cell densities up to 1. 6 · 106 cells/ml. A culture system is described which enables us to use large cell aggregates as a continuous source of single cells and small cell aggregates (containing up to 10 cells) for mutagenesis, plating and protoplast production. Arabidopsis plants were regenerated from young calluses grown in solid or liquid cultures, by a sequential transfer from a medium (PG 3), where shoot initiation takes place, to a PG 4 medium which induces root formation. The morphogenetic potential appeared {{to depend on the}} age of the callus in culture. A wide range of heteroploidy has been observed in tissue cultures. The influence of factors such as the age of the callus, the type of organ used to induce calluses, the hormone ratio and the composition of the medium was determined. A procedure for the isolation of protoplasts from leaves and cell cultures is described. © 1975. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|English ivy (Hedera helix) is {{a member}} of the ginseng family of plants (Araliaceae). It grows as a vine for up to ten years {{producing}} deeply lobed, alternating, waxy leaves with three to five points. When the plant is mature and ready to bear fruit, the leaves are only slightly lobed, if at all. Leaves are thick, waxy, shiny dark green and have distinct pale colored veins. Mature plants produce umbels (umbrella –shaped clusters) of greenish white flowers in the fall resulting in a deep purple, soft skinned, berry-like fruit in the spring. Each berry may contain up to three seeds that can be widely dispersed by birds. Vine stems begin pale green and slender when growing along the ground and quickly become woody and stout on climbing vines. Stems produce rootlets that give the vine a hairy appearance and produce a sticky substance that allows the vine to cling to vertical surfaces. Vines can produce roots from each node, allowing it to re-establish itself from cut <b>stems</b> <b>and</b> <b>pieces</b> of stems left on the ground. Impacts: English ivy is an invasive vine in the Pacific Northwest. It grows so rapidly that it surrounds and covers many native plants so that sunlight doesn’t reach them and they die. Once the vines create a thick mat across the ground, other plants have little chance to get reestablished. On trees, the vines can cling to the trunk and branches and grow up and over a 90 foot tree. If left uncontrolled, the ivy will make the tree top-heavy, block out sunlight, and gradually branche...|$|E

Instead, it mostly reproduces vegetatively, by underground rhizomes. The rhizomes are tough and fibrous and form knotty, spreading mats that penetrate deep into the soil up to 1 m deep (Alden et al., 1998; Mackenzie, 2004). <b>Stem</b> <b>and</b> rhizome <b>pieces</b> less than 5 cm long and containing a single node readily sprouted {{under a variety of}} conditions (Boose and Holt, 1999). This vegetative growth appears to be well adapted to floods, which may break up individual A. donax clumps, spreading the pieces, which may sprout and colonise further downstream (Mackenzie 2004).|$|R

25|$|Initial hip {{designs were}} made of a {{one-piece}} femoral component and a one-piece acetabular component. Current designs have a femoral <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> separate head <b>piece.</b> Using an independent head allows the surgeon to adjust leg length (some heads seat more or less onto the <b>stem)</b> <b>and</b> to select from various materials from which the head is formed. A modern acetabulum component is also made up of two parts: a metal shell with a coating for bone attachment and a separate liner. First the shell is placed. Its position can be adjusted, unlike the original cemented cup design which are fixed in place once the cement sets. When proper positioning of the metal shell is obtained, the surgeon may select a liner made from various materials.|$|R

50|$|Most plant {{cuttings}} are <b>stem</b> <b>pieces,</b> <b>and</b> have no {{root system}} of their own, {{they are likely}} to die from dehydration if the proper conditions are not met. They require a moist medium, which, however, cannot be too wet lest the cutting rot. A number of media are used in this process, including but not limited to soil, perlite, vermiculite, coir, rock wool, expanded clay pellets, and even water given the right conditions. Most succulent cuttings can be left in open air until the cut surface dries, which may improve root formation when the cutting is later planted.|$|R
40|$|Experiments are {{presented}} which show that Botrytis cinerea, {{the cause of}} gray mould disease, is often present in symptomless lettuce plants as a systemic, endophytic, infection which may arise from seed. The fungus was isolated on selective media from surface sterilized sections of roots, <b>stem</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>and</b> leaf discs from symptomless plants grown in a conventional glasshouse and in a spore-free air-flow provided by an isolation propagator. The presence of B. cinerea was confirmed by immuno-labelling the tissues with the Botrytis-specific monoclonal antibody BC- 12. CA 4. As plants grew, infection spread from the roots to <b>stems</b> <b>and</b> leaves. Surface sterilization of seeds {{reduced the number of}} infected symptomless plants. Artificial infection of seedlings with dry conidia increased the rate of infection in some experiments. Selected isolates were genetically finger-printed using microsatellite loci. This confirmed systemic spread of the inoculating isolates but showed that other isolates were also present and that single plants hosted multiple isolates. This shows that B. cinerea commonly grows in lettuce plants as an endophyte, as has already been shown for Primula. If true for other hosts, the endophytic phase may be as important a component of the species population as the aggressive necrotrophic phase...|$|R
40|$|The {{host range}} of M. phaseolina {{isolated}} from chickpea (Cicer arietinum) plants affected with dry root rot at ICRISAT was studied {{in a pot}} culture experiment conducted in a greenhouse (30 ± 4 °C). Seeds of 46 plant species were sown in 20 cm plastic pots containing 10 % (w/w) fungus inoculum multiplied on 1 % peptone-treated chickpea <b>stem</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>and</b> black soil mixture. Of the 44 that showed infection, 11 were new hosts: Celosia argentea, Corchorus trilocularis, Cyanotis axillaris, Dactyloctenium aegyptium, Digera muricata. Digitaria ciliaris, Echinochloa colonum, Eclipta prostrata, Indigofera glandulosa, Trianthema portulacastrum and Tridax procumbens.

40|$|Soil {{moisture}} {{and the type}} of organic matter colonised by Phylophlhora cinnamomi significantly affected long-term survival of the pathogen. Banksia grandis <b>stem</b> <b>pieces,</b> <b>and</b> root tips of Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah) colonised with P. cinnamomi were placed into pots filled with soil from the jarrah forest or an adjacent rehabilitated bauxite mine site in the south west of Western Australia. The soil was either maintained at container capacity, or allowed to dry-out slowly from container capacity. Samples were harvested over a 210 -day period and assessed for P. cinnamomi survival. P. cinnamomi was recovered after 210 days from banksia stems (98 % colonisation) and eucalypt root tips (45 % colonisation) from both soil types when the soil was maintained at container capacity. However when the soils were allowed to dry, the pathogen was not recovered after 112 days from either banksia stems or eucalypt roots. Soil origin did not influence P. cinnamomi survival for either inoculum type. These findings indicate that under moist conditions the pathogen can survive in small pieces of organic matter for extended periods of time...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Pannexin 1 forms ion and {{metabolite}} permeable hexameric {{channels and}} is abundantly {{expressed in the}} brain. After discovering pannexin 1 expression in postnatal neural <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> progenitor cells we sought to elucidate its functional role in neuronal development. Results We detected pannexin 1 in neural <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> progenitor cells in vitro and in vivo. We manipulated pannexin 1 expression and activity in Neuro 2 a neuroblastoma cells and primary postnatal neurosphere cultures to demonstrate that pannexin 1 regulates neural <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> progenitor cell proliferation likely through the release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Conclusions Permeable to ATP, a potent autocrine/paracine signaling metabolite, pannexin 1 channels are ideally suited to influence the behavior of neural <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> progenitor cells. Here we demonstrate they play a robust role in the regulation of neural <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> progenitor cell proliferation. Endogenous postnatal neural <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> progenitor cells are crucial for normal brain health, and their numbers decline with age. Furthermore, these special cells are highly responsive to neurological injury and disease, and are gaining attention as putative targets for brain repair. Therefore, understanding the fundamental role of pannexin 1 channels in neural <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> progenitor cells is of critical importance for brain health and disease. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{field of}} <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> {{progenitor}} cell biology is expanding. Much of the enthusiasm {{is based on}} the potential of using <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> progenitor cells as a cellular therapy for the treatment of human disease. Although the concept of using human embryonic stem cells for therapeutic indications is intriguing, significant challenges face investigators pursuing research in this area. Therefore, renewed scientific energy is focusing on the molecular pathways that differentiate a pluripotent embryonic stem cell from more-committed tissue-specific cells. Molecular mechanisms that govern tissue-specific <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> progenitor cell function are also topics of intense investigation, given that altered function of these cells may promote a variety of human pathologies including aging, vascular disease, and cancer. Considerable progress has been made, but a clear identification of the molecular signatures of <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> progenitor cells remains elusive.
