5|$|Most of {{the special}} edition's footage was first seen when the film made its {{broadcast}} television debut on CBS in 1989, but two additional sequences concerning Burke's transmission to the colony about the derelict, and the Jorden family's subsequent discovery of the same, {{were added to the}} initial Laserdisc release. According to Cameron, the visual effects for the scene were incomplete, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> back to the Skotak brothers and had them finish the sequences. All currently available versions {{of the special}} edition contain these scenes.|$|E
5|$|Visits to one {{hospital}} that was experienced {{in addressing the}} health problems of drug addicts left Hope {{feeling that he was}} being experimented on, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> to another, St. Clare's. Here, according to his wife, the treatment was not adjusted for the methadone program he was on, putting added strain on his heart. Hope was hospitalized with pneumonia in 1967 and died a few weeks later, on May 19, of heart failure. His wife was aged 31 {{at the time of his}} death. They had three children; their daughter, Monica Hope, became a singer.|$|E
5|$|Although {{by the end}} of 1837 the Arms Company {{had made}} over 1,000 weapons, there were no sales. Following the Panic of 1837, the company's {{underwriters}} were reluctant to fund the new machinery that Colt needed to make interchangeable parts, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> on the road to raise money. Demonstrating his gun to people in general stores did not generate the sales volume he needed, so with another loan from his cousin, Selden, he went to Washington, D.C., and demonstrated it to President Andrew Jackson. Jackson approved of the gun and wrote Colt a note saying so. Presidential approval in hand, Colt pushed a bill through Congress endorsing a demonstration for the military, but failed to obtain an appropriation for military purchase of the weapon. A promising order from the state of South Carolina for fifty to seventy-five pistols was canceled when the company did not produce them quickly enough.|$|E

5|$|Beckett {{struggled}} {{in the early}} part of the 2013 season with an 0–5 record and 5.19 ERA in eight starts. He was placed on the disabled list with a groin strain on May 15. While on the disabled list he began to experience numbness and tingling in his hand <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> to see a nerve specialist and expressed doubt as to whether he would be able to pitch again. The Dodgers shut him down from pitching for a month while he underwent a rigorous rehabilitation program in an effort to avoid season-ending surgery. However, the tingling sensation returned when he attempted to resume his throwing program in late June. He was diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome, which required him to undergo surgery on July 10, 2013 that ended his 2013 season.|$|E
5|$|The film {{is based}} on the real life of Ron Woodroof, a patient of HIV and AIDS, who {{was the subject of a}} lengthy 1992 article in The Dallas Morning News written by {{journalist}} and author Bill Minutaglio. A month before Woodroof died in September 1992, screenwriter Craig Borten was told about the story by his friend, <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> and interviewed him to create the screenplay; Borten recorded many hours of interviews with Woodroof and had access to his personal journals. Borten wrote a script for what he believed would make a great movie and attempted to attract interest in making the film in mid 1996, with Dennis Hopper attached to direct. Columbia Pictures was set to buy the script but the film was unable to secure financial backing.|$|E

The Queen was impressed by his humility and pleaded for his life so Alexander was imprisoned again, this time in Tantallon Castle.|$|E

He remained at Brockville for four years gaining more league appearances than he had elsewhere; {{in light of his}} experience he was promoted to player-coach, but when John Prentice became manager he removed Ferguson's coaching responsibilities.

25|$|The troops proclaimed Julian Augustus in Paris, {{and this}} in turn led to a very swift {{military}} effort to secure or win the allegiance of others. Although the full details are unclear, {{there is evidence to}} suggest that Julian may have at least partially stimulated the insurrection. If <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> back to business as usual in Gaul, for, from June to August of that year, Julian led a successful campaign against the Attuarian Franks. In November, Julian began openly using the title Augustus, even issuing coins with the title, sometimes with Constantius, sometimes without. He celebrated his fifth year in Gaul with a big show of games.|$|E
25|$|His basic {{assumptions}} {{were very}} similar to those of Le Sage and Preston, but he gave a more detailed application of the kinetic theory. However, by asserting that the velocity of the corpuscles after collision was reduced without any corresponding increase in the energy of any other object, his model violated the conservation of energy. He noted that there is a connection between the weight of a body and its density (because any decrease in the density of an object reduces the internal shielding) <b>so</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> on to assert that warm bodies should be heavier than colder ones (related to the effect of thermal expansion).|$|E

When, in 1835, the theological opinions of his father prevented him to transfer to Oxford University he decided to complete his medical education in Continental Europe. <b>So,</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> to study in Bonn, then in Paris and finally in Berlin where he earned his Medical Degree in September 1837. Then, between 1838 and 1839, he spent almost a year in Dublin working at the Rotunda Hospital and at the Meath Hospital, highly renowned at {{the time for the}} clinical glamour of Robert Graves and William Stokes.|$|E

In order to do <b>so,</b> <b>he</b> <b>went</b> on a building campaign to establish religious Jewish day schools and yeshivas for boys and girls, women and men. He established printing houses for the voluminous writings and publications of his movement, and started the process of spreading Jewish observance to the Jewish masses worldwide.|$|E
