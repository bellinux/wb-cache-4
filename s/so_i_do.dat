25|$|In {{the whole}} of the ten years I have been working on radio and television, I have been working to a {{majority}} of women. I think women prefer men to be well-mannered, so I always try to watch my manners. They like men to be well dressed, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> my best to observe this. Others bring to my notice the fact that I sometimes make grammatical errors in my speech; so, because of this, I try to watch my grammar – {{but at the same time}} I bear in mind that it's more profitable for me to be entertaining than to be perfect in my use of English.|$|E

500|$|As the Scientific Phenomentalist, Lovering {{performs}} {{science and}} physics experiments {{in a lab}} coat while on stage. He shuns traditional magic tricks, and prefers [...] "things that are more mental, using mental powers". He later explained: [...] "It's all kind of upbeat, really weird physics experiments that you'll never see. [...] I'd rather have them [...] going 'Is it [...] or isn't it?' rather than 'It's all science' or 'It's all magic'. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> kinda weird things that other magicians don't do". Lovering cites sleight-of-hand artist Ricky Jay, mind reader Max Maven and Eugene Burger as influences on his technique. His performances often involve intricate self-built machines.|$|E

500|$|Actor John Noble {{called the}} {{beginning}} scene with Olivia and Walter naked [...] "the funniest thing" [...] yet, explaining [...] "The writers keep throwing challenges at me, because I never say no. They said, 'Okay, John, you’ll do a scene naked.' I said 'Okay.' And {{so that was}} a big surprise. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> this scene, this strange scene with Anna Torv, without any clothes on. Anna’s staying at the Bishop house with Walter running around with no clothes on except for a pair of slippers, getting breakfast. She comes round the corner and catches him in the full monty, going, 'Oh no!' Didn’t know where to look. That {{was probably one of the}} most fun things we ever did. Anna’s reaction was priceless to that. I haven’t seen the scene yet, but it was hilarious to do it." ...|$|E
500|$|Reflecting on Arsenal's defeat, Wenger {{felt that}} [...] " [...] {{is not too}} important. We have won four Community Shields and no-one regards it as a trophy <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not mind anymore." [...] He felt Chelsea's game plan was [...] "very direct" [...] and {{admitted}} Drogba gave his team [...] "a hard time on the long balls". Wenger absolved Senderos of any blame for the two goals – [...] "it would be unfair" [...] – and believed Fàbregas showed why he was a capable replacement for Patrick Vieira, who left in the summer: [...] "He controlled the game and for me was outstanding." [...] When {{asked if he was}} worried about Chelsea, Wenger retorted: [...] "Did you see the game today? You can be worried if you are a Chelsea supporter," [...] an indirect reference to their style of football.|$|E

They're just very {{involved in the project}} as far as bringing the music, playing songs, just giving their input. [...] I really want to pick the perfect single though. It's been a second since I've been out musically, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not want to fail and I don't believe in failure, so I just try new things and figure out the pieces. That's one thing that's great about Wayne. He's like, 'Work with different producers, take your time, but at the same time, try new things. Don't be stuck on one thing.'" [...] In July 2013, it was discovered that her contract with The Voice would be ended.|$|E
500|$|As Morrison began live {{performances}} of the 40-year-old album Astral Weeks in 2008, there were comparisons to his youthful voice of 1968. His early voice was described as [...] "flinty and tender, beseeching and plaintive". Forty years later, the difference in his vocal range and power were noticeable but reviewers and critic's comments were favourable: [...] "Morrison's voice has expanded to fill his frame; a deeper, louder roar than the blue-eyed soul voice of his youth – softer on the diction – but none the less impressively powerful." [...] Morrison also commented on the changes in his approach to singing: [...] "The approach now is to sing from lower down [...] <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not ruin my voice. Before, I sang in the upper area of my throat, which tends to wreck the vocal cords over time. Singing from lower in the belly allows my resonance to carry far. I can stand four feet from a mic and be heard quite resonantly." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Since U Been Gone" [...] was {{directed}} by Alex De Rakoff in early November 2004.

She added, [...] "You know, 'Why don't I just go trash her house? [...] And <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> it in the video. All I do is break stuff. It's a cool job. I could get used to this." [...] Clarkson expressed that in the music video, viewers would get to see her act out of character. She explained, [...] "In the beginning, I'm like tipping things over and smearing mud all over the walls and it seems like my apartment, but it ends up being the other girl's that he's with, so it's a humorous video." [...] The music video premiered on Total Request Live on November 16, 2004.|$|E

500|$|In May 2010, Cooper {{felt that}} she had been sidelined by former {{producer}} Lucy Allan and that Jacqui had lost her identity. New executive producer Paul Marquess also felt that Cooper had been under used. He decided to split Jacqui away {{from the rest of the}} McQueens, his reason for which being that there was so much [...] "talent" [...] in terms of acting within the family, he felt Cooper or Jacqui didn't need that [...] "support system". He increased her role in storylines. This made Cooper delighted, of the changes she stated: [...] "he seemed to like what I did and he's worked on it and developed it. Paul has really taken me under his wing, he's worked me so hard and he's given me opportunities that I could only have dreamt of." [...] Speaking of her approach to playing Jacqui, Cooper has said: [...] "I try to tame Claire back because I'm a really emotional, sensitive person and very different from Jacqui, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> work hard and I feel very privileged." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band has}} named the group Melvins as an {{influence}} on its development, but the most-publicized influence is progressive rock pioneer group King Crimson. Longtime King Crimson member Robert Fripp has downplayed any influence his band had on Tool. In an interview, Fripp touched on how the two bands relate to each other, stating [...] "Do you hear the influence? There's just one figure where I hear an influence, just one. It was a piece we were developing that we dropped. And it's {{almost exactly the same}} figure: three note arpeggio with a particular accent from the guitar. <b>So</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think you could have heard it. That's the only thing." [...] He also said, [...] "I happen to be a Tool fan. The members of Tool have been generous enough to suggest that Crimson has been {{an influence on}} them. Adam Jones asked me if I could detect it in their music, and I said I couldn’t. I can detect more Tool influence in King Crimson, than I can hear King Crimson in Tool." [...] In describing their wide range of styles, critics have noted that they are [...] "influenced as much by Pink Floyd as by the Sex Pistols". Other reported influences of the band include Rush, Helmet, Faith No More and Jane's Addiction.|$|E
500|$|After {{spending}} some {{months in the}} United States, Stan began working on the track in October 2013 at the two-weeks inaugural international songwriting FonoCamp in 2013, held in Azuga, Romania, where she met various Romanian and international artists. [...] "Thanks for Leaving" [...] was written by Lee Anna James, Naz Tokio, Sebastian Jacome and Alexandru Cotoi, while being solely produced by Jacome and Cotoi. When interviewed by Direct Lyrics, she stated that, [...] "This might sound like a cliché, but I expressed myself best through my work. 'Thanks For Leaving' is a song that I had to do and had to sing, it carries such a strong emotional message for me. It talks about {{how important it is}} sometimes to just let go of things and move on. I feel like I've done that. I know others relate to the song's message too, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> hope it has helped them do the same." [...] The single portrays a [...] "modern" [...] electropop song and a pop ballad, which acts as a departure from her previous dance styles. It also serves as the first ballad released in her career. Lyrically, the recording delves on themes of new beginnings, choices that can be made in difficult situations in order to move forward, and discovering the joy of being yourself. In interviews, Stan expressed that the content of [...] "Thanks for Leaving" [...] is personal and refers to her recovery following her alleged violent incident previously mentioned with Prodan. Florin Grozea of newspaper Adevărul felt the line [...] "I won't spend another day with you inside my head... How could you be so cruel? Turned me into a liar." [...] was directly addressed to Prodan.|$|E

500|$|Unhappy {{with the}} quality of 1980's Live at Last, the band {{recorded}} another live album—titled Live Evil—during the Mob Rules world tour, across the United States in Dallas, San Antonio, and Seattle, in 1982. During the mixing process for the album, Iommi and Butler had a falling out with Dio. Misinformed by their then-current mixing engineer, Iommi and Butler accused Dio of sneaking into the studio at night to raise the volume of his vocals. In addition, Dio was not satisfied with the pictures of him in the artwork. Butler also accused Dio and Appice of working on a solo album during the album's mixing without telling the other members of Black Sabbath. [...] "Ronnie wanted more say in things," [...] Iommi said. [...] "And Geezer would get upset with him and that is where the rot set in. Live Evil is when it all fell apart. Ronnie wanted to do more of his own thing, and the engineer we were using at the time in the studio didn't know what to do, because Ronnie was telling him one thing and we were telling him another. At the end of the day, we just said, 'That's it, the band is over'". [...] "When it comes time for the vocal, nobody tells me what to do. Nobody! Because they're not as good as me, <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> what I want to do," [...] Dio later said. [...] "I refuse to listen to Live Evil, because there are too many problems. If you look at the credits, the vocals and drums are listed off to the side. Open up the album and see how many pictures there are of Tony, and how many there are of me and Vinny".|$|E

2500|$|The cognitive-developmental {{theory is}} also {{closely linked to}} Jean Piaget’s {{analysis}} for the age-related cognitive changes a child goes through. Lawrence Kohlberg suggested that cognition comes before action and behavior (“I am a boy <b>so</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> boy-like things”). This {{emphasizes the importance of}} a child’s understanding about gender roles and their permanent placement in it. After a child can fully grasp this concept, gender-specific information will become more relevant. This idea of gender consistency, similar to Piaget’s concrete-operational stage, is represented by three stages: ...|$|E

[...] Cockburn responded [...] "I think Israel is secure. I don't think it's struggling for survival... It's protected by the United States. I don't see any threat to Israel's survival, it's ludicrous to say <b>so.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> see a threat to [...] survival of Palestinians, who are living on what a dollar a day in Gaza." ...|$|E
