40|$|One form of waterproof, {{breathable}} apparel is manufactured from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane {{laminated fabric}} using a specific process to <b>seal</b> <b>seams</b> {{that have been}} sewn with traditional techniques. The sealing process involves applying waterproof tape to the seam by feeding the seam through two rollers while applying hot air (600 20 C). This study addressed the potential for exposure to particulate matter from this sealing process by characterizing airborne particles in a facility that produces more than 1000 lightweight PTFE rain jackets per day. Aerosol concentrations throughout the facility were mapped, breathing zone concentrations were measured, and hoods used to ventilate the <b>seam</b> <b>sealing</b> operation were evaluated. The geometric mean (GM) particle number concentrations were substantially greater in the sewing and sealing areas (67, 000 and 188, 000 particles cm 2 ? 23)) compared with that measured in the office area (12, 100 particles cm 2 ? 23). Respirable mass concentrations were negligible throughout the facility (GM = 0. 002 mg m 2 ? 23) in the sewing and sealing areas). The particles exiting the final discharge of the facility's ventilation system were dominated by nanoparticles (number median diameter = 25 nm; geometric standard deviation of 1. 39). The breathing zone particle number concentrations of the workers who <b>sealed</b> the sewn <b>seams</b> were highly variable and significantly greater when <b>sealing</b> <b>seams</b> than when conducting other tasks (p < 0. 0001). The sealing workers' breathing zone concentrations ranged from 147, 000 particles cm 2 ? 23 to 798, 000 particles cm 2 ? 23, and their seam responsibility significantly influenced their breathing zone concentrations (p = 0. 03). The finding that particle number concentrations were approximately equal outside the hood and inside the local exhaust duct indicated poor effectiveness of the canopy hoods used to ventilate sealing operations.

During the hemming process, air-filled cavities can form within the bonded hem flange, {{which in turn}} can lead to blisters forming in the PVC <b>seam</b> <b>seal.</b> Since the <b>seam</b> <b>seal</b> remains visible, the blisters adversely affect the optical quality of the end product.

To avoid the latter, any defect in the <b>seam</b> <b>seal</b> during their manufacture has to be repaired, a step involving time-consuming and cost-intensive finishing work. In order to avoid the costs associated with repairs, more intensive quality control, and potential damage of the manufacturer’s reputation in case severe corrosion issues arise, appropriate measures have to be taken.

An {{example is the}} application of PVC materials for <b>seam</b> <b>sealing</b> over the joined edges to close small openings {{that are difficult to}} shut with other materials. The parameters of the free jet and the material properties are of great importance for the quality of the sealing. The work is focused on the seam formation process with the thin jet spraying using ANSYS-Fluent as a CFD program for numerical simulations. The objective of <b>seam</b> <b>sealing</b> simulations is to develop a model in the most efficient form considering all the relevant application parameters (dose, nozzle design, operating parameters, application geometry) and material properties for process optimization. Regarding the physical process, the flow has a high viscosity and presents a rheological behaviour under given production conditions. These rheological models for the non-Newtonian behaviour of the coating materials are implemented by the so-called "User-Defined functions" and transport equations. The Volume of Fluid (VOF) method in ANSYS-Fluent is used, in which a two-phase flow with two immiscible fluids (air and PVC) and their interface are simulated. The boundary phase of both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids (Herschel-Bulkley-law and Thixotropic model) are simulated and compared. Different geometries, in order to represent the automotive bodywork geometry and a round nozzle are generated with the CDF program ANSYS-Workbench. The investigation of the grid sensitivity is studied by the generation of various meshes and refinements with the Adaptation method in ANSYS-Fluent.

40|$|Sequences of {{operations}} on packaging machines {{can be described}} as a series of basic operations. Such basic operations are, for instance, the transport of the packaging material through the machine, the moulding of the packaging material to the package, by folding for example, the dosing and filling up of the products to be packed and the closing of the filled package, for instance by heat sealing. There are several characteristic basic operations for every type of packaging machine. The aim is to find out the relevant properties of the packaging materials for the several basic operations and to determine ranges of numerical values for them wherein maximum undisturbed processing is guaranteed. This is demonstrated on the vertical pouch form-fill seal machine. The tightness of the closures, which are mostly attainable by heat sealing in the case of plastic films, laminated material and plastic coated papers, is of great importance for maintaining the quality of the packed product. The quality of the heat-sealed seams depends on temperature, pressure and dwell time at the heat-sealing process on the one hand, and on the sealing procedure and on the construction of the heat sealing devices, especially of the surface profile, on the other hand.

40|$|In high {{performance}} waterproof clothing, seam tape and welds fail before {{other parts of}} the garment. This paper examines a method of <b>sealing</b> <b>seams</b> in which the needle waterproofs the holes it creates by sealing them with a film of a thickness governed by the Landau-Levich law. The equation governing Landau-Levich behavior is combined with equations describing hole geometry to develop a phase space describing the fluidic and geometric properties necessary to seal a hole. A manual proof of concept test is performed which demonstrates that the basic method works. The needle speed of a standard sewing machine is then measured as is the size of the hole made by a standard sewing machine needle. These values are then used to calculate the viscosity of a fluid that will satisfy the conditions described by the phase space. An adhesive with the calculated viscosity is made and is used on a test bed to seal holes made by a needle. Each individual hole is sealed and further tests show that the seals are waterproof. Both the proof of concept and test bed experiments confirm the theory and it is concluded that needle speed, film length, and viscosity are the variables that can be controlled to tune hole sealing. by Cole Houston.
