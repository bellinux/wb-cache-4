50|$|In 1992, {{the newly}} founded TWIKE Ltd. decided {{to develop the}} TWIKE II into a {{production}} vehicle and began looking for capital and customers. Production of the TWIKE III began in 1995 and during 1996 the reformed TWIKE AG produced and sold 190 vehicles, mostly in Switzerland and Germany. The TWIKE III was already equipped with an asynchronous AC motor and 336V NiCd batteries, the system still in use today. The pedal drive was simplified to a 5-speed hub gear and was included in all but very few <b>special</b> <b>order</b> <b>vehicles.</b>|$|R
50|$|Horse-drawn mail vans were {{replaced}} by automotive mail vans. These were commercial vans. For example, over almost two decades the U.K. General Post Office purchased 50,000 Morris Minor light commercial vehicles for use as either mail vans or telephone engineer vans. These Morris Minor vans became a familiar sight, {{and at least one}} survived until 1982 to sport the livery of British Telecom. The GPO <b>vehicles</b> were <b>special</b> <b>order</b> <b>vehicles,</b> and not quite the same as the commercial Morris Minor LCVs. The early series vans had one seat, no heater, and headlamps fitted {{to the front of the}} vehicle on rubber wings (US: fenders). Later series adhered more closely to conventional LCV norms, but differences remained. The Series III GPO Morris Minor van, for example, had a Yale lock on the driver's door.|$|R
5000|$|The {{distinctive}} blue paint color used on Michigan State Police vehicles {{is one of}} the few {{law enforcement}} <b>vehicle</b> <b>special</b> <b>order</b> (VSO) colors that manufacturers add to their color palette specifically for an agency. [...] Per Michigan State Police specifications, the color is the [...] "same as Dulux 93-032" [...] (and which may be identified by other color designations or codes depending on whether Ford, GM, or Chrysler produced the vehicle to which the paint is applied). MSP is fairly unusual in its use of both the blue paint of the patrol cars and the red hue of the rotating overhead light as basic livery; the department has used the blue paint scheme and the current door decals since 1954.|$|R
5000|$|Brooklin makes cars, trucks, boats, {{trailers}} {{and a few}} other <b>special</b> <b>order</b> <b>vehicles</b> and items. The main Brooklin line is almost always American makes. Since most parts are hand cast in white metal, without plastic parts, models are notable for their weight. According to the Brooklin website, John Hall, had been an engineering instructor at the University of Toronto, and left to make white metal models of cars. His first creations were fairly crude, without plastic windows, few details and with white rubber tires (Sinclair's 1978). Despite the simplicity, not many companies in the 1970s were producing early American auto models and David Sinclair, one of the earliest importer's of scale models to the United States, reported that models were commonly sold to collectors in Germany and Japan (Sinclair's 1978; Levine 2009).|$|R

5000|$|India's Supreme Court {{examined}} the facts {{related to the}} state government of Odisha's initiatives to enter into MoU to encourage {{economic growth in the}} state, and whether such development meets the intent of ecological and environmental laws of India. On 8 August 2008, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the state of Odisha, in Case Law I.A. number 2134 of 2007, titled T.N. Godavaraman Thirumulpad vs. Union of India, State of Odisha and others. In their ruling, the Supreme Court justices wrote, [...] "the State of Odisha is to be associated with <b>Special</b> Purpose <b>Vehicle</b> in <b>order</b> to ensure implementation of proper schemes {{for the development of the}} tribal area and in our Order it has not been suggested for incorporation of the <b>Special</b> Purpose <b>Vehicle</b> to take over the mines which have been leased out by State of Odisha to the lessee. The reason is obvious. We cannot change leases/MoUs/joint venture agreements signed between the parties at earlier point of time which have been approved by the Ministry of Mines, Government of India, and other Authorities. The object for passing the Order was to strike a balance between development and environmental protection. The Lanjigarh tehsil in Kalahandi district, as stated in our Order dated 23.11.07, faces abject poverty. At the same time the area is eco-sensitive area. We have tried to strike a balance in order to subserve the principle of Sustainable Development." ...|$|R
