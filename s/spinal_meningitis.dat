What is meningitis? Meningitis is an infection of the lining that surrounds the brain and <b>spinal</b> cord. <b>Meningitis</b> can have multiple causes, including viruses and bacteria. One type of bacteria that causes meningitis is the meningococcus bacteria. Meningococcal disease is a very serious condition. Even with appropriate antibiotic treatment, meningococcal disease can cause death or result in life-long disability. Fortunately, meningococcal disease is not common and preventative vaccines are available. Is bacterial meningitis contagious? Yes. While bacterial meningitis is not as contagious as a cold or the flu, it can still be passed on through contact with a sick person’s throat or mouth secretions. For example, it can be passed from person to person through coughing or kissing. Individuals living close together, like students in a college dorm, are at increased risk for getting bacterial meningitis. What is the meningococcal vaccine?

Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis are common bacteria and are also commensal in the human respiratory tract without causing disease.

AIMS: In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of cisternal irrigation {{in the prevention of}} meningitis complications. SETTING AND STUDY DESIGN: Experimental study was done in the Social Security Hospital of Erzurum. Histopathological specimens were evaluated in the Pathology Department in the Ataturk University Research Hospital, Erzurum, Turkey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted on twelve lambs. Experimental meningitis was achieved with streptococcus pneumonia. Two animals were not treated. Ten animals were given CefotaximeR (4 x 1 g/day) for 20 days, and additionally half of these animals underwent cisternal irrigation. Then, all animals were sacrificed and brains were observed histopathologically. RESULTS: Massive purulent CSF formation, hemorrhagic cortical lesions, vascular congestion, leptomeningeal and cortical adhesions and brain edema were observed in the non-irrigated group, but these findings were observed slightly or absent in the irrigated group. CONCLUSION: Meningitis can affect all central neural tissues, consequently serious central nervous system lesions may develop. The irrigation procedure may decrease the percentage and severity of meningitis complications by way of the excretion of inflammed purulent collection from the subarachnoid spaces...|$|R

Preputial isolates showed a lower molecular mass major outer membrane protein than septicemic isolates.
