40|$|The {{fundamental}} <b>skeletal</b> <b>substance</b> of {{the cell}} walls of terrestrial plants is cellulose, a linear macromolecule built up of (1 - 4) -linked X-D-glucopyranose residues. In its native state cellulose may have a weight-average degree of polymerization {{in the neighborhood of}} 10, 000. In wood, the cellulose bundles are imbedded in an amorphous mass of lignin and a polysaccharide material known as hemicellulose. Lignin is a three-dimensional polymer of phenyl propane units.

50|$|In 1912, Harvard University {{researchers}} Otto Folin and Willey Glover Denis {{found evidence}} that ingesting creatine can dramatically boost the creatine content of the muscle. In the late 1920s, after finding that the intramuscular stores of creatine can be increased by ingesting creatine in larger than normal amounts, scientists discovered creatine phosphate, and determined that creatine is {{a key player in}} the metabolism of <b>skeletal</b> muscle. The <b>substance</b> creatine is naturally formed in vertebrates.|$|R
40|$|A {{quantitative}} assessment of structural constituents in humic substances has been achieved {{on the basis of}} 13 C-NMR spectra of the residues obtained after multi-step chemical degradations. The sequence used (ultrasonic disruption in methylene chloride, followed by boron-trifluoride-methanol transesterification and hydroiodic acid treatment) was designed to progressively remove structures predominantly associated by physical interactions, ester bonds and ether bonds, leading to a residue presumably consisting of a C-C linked <b>skeletal</b> network. The <b>substances</b> analyzed were humic acids (HAs) from four widely different soil types in addition to the corresponding humins isolated by two procedures based, respectively, on flotation in a dense liquid after ultrasonic disaggregation and on partition in water-methylisobutylketone. About 30 % of the carbon in HAs and humins was transformed into soluble materials by the transesterification treatment, whereas a large variability in the amount of the structures removed by the ether-cleaving treatment was observed, the greatest values corresponding to humins. In both cases, the above treatments seem to lead to a kerogen-like residue. The results provide indirect evidence for the presence of non-hydrolyzable esters, heavily-altered glycolipid-like structures and recalcitrant polymethylene material in humic substances.

40|$|Patch-clamp {{techniques}} {{were used to}} examine the effect of substance P on acetylcholine-induced current in bovine chromaffin cells. Cells had been enzymatically isolated and kept in short-term culture. Experiments were performed at 22 degrees C. Under whole-cell voltage-clamp conditions substance P alone (2 - 10 microM) did not induce ionic currents. Acetylcholine (ACh, 20 microM) at - 60 mV induced an inward current that desensitized in the continued presence of ACh. The time course of desensitization was somewhat variable from cell to cell. In most cases it could be fitted by a single exponential with time constant of 8 - 10 s. Substance P (2 - 50 microM) applied simultaneously with ACh induced what appeared to be an acceleration of the desensitization process. The time course in the presence of 10 microM-substance P (20 microM-ACh) was best fitted by the sum of two exponentials with time constants of 0. 6 s and 5 s respectively. The effect was reversible. The recovery of ACh-induced current from desensitization was not affected by substance P. The time constant for recovery was approximately 7 s in {{the presence or absence of}} substance P. Single-channel records showed that the conductance of individual channels was not changed by substance P. The mean open time of single channels was shortened by substance P both at high (20 microM) and at low (0. 5 microM) concentrations of ACh. The inverse mean open time varied linearly with substance P concentration. Single-channel responses appeared in bursts and clusters after almost complete desensitization at 20 microM-ACh, as was previously observed in frog <b>skeletal</b> muscle. <b>Substance</b> P dramatically reduced ACh current by increasing interburst intervals while decreasing burst duration and the number of openings per burst. We conclude that substance P inhibits ACh-induced depolarization of chromaffin cells either by increasing the rate of desensitization or by inducing channel blockade, which indirectly enhances desensitization. Possible models of desensitization in the absence and presence of substance P are discussed...|$|R
