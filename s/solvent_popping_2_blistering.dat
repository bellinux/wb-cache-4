40|$|This {{invention}} {{provides a}} novel pyrin-only protein (<b>POP</b> <b>2),</b> polypeptides, and nucleic acids encoding them and methods for making and using them. <b>POP</b> <b>2</b> is a 294 nt single exon gene located on human chromosome 3 encoding a 97 amino acid protein with sequence and predicted structural similarity to other pyrin domains. Highly similar to pyrin domains in CATERPILLER (CLR, NLR, NALP) family proteins, <b>POP</b> <b>2</b> is less like the prototypic Pyrin and ASC pyrin domains. <b>POP</b> <b>2</b> is expressed principally in peripheral blood leukocytes and displays both cytoplasmic and nuclear expression patterns in transfected cells. TNFα-stimulated and p 65 (RelA) induced NF-κB-dependent gene transcription is inhibited by <b>POP</b> <b>2</b> in vitro by a mechanism involving changes in NF-κB nuclear import or distribution. While colocalizing with ASC in perinuclear specks, <b>POP</b> <b>2</b> also inhibits {{the formation of}} specks by the CLR protein CIAS 1 /NALP 3. <b>POP</b> <b>2</b> is a negative regulator of NF-κB activity that may influence the assembly of pyrin-domain dependent complexes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Pyrin-only protein <b>2</b> (<b>POP</b> <b>2)</b> {{is a small}} human protein {{comprised}} solely of a pyrin domain that inhibits NF-κB p 65 /RelA {{and blocks}} the formation of functional IL- 1 β processing inflammasomes. Pyrin proteins are abundant in mammals and several, like <b>POP</b> <b>2,</b> {{have been linked to}} activation or regulation of inflammatory processes. Because <b>POP</b> <b>2</b> knockout mice would help probe the biological role of inflammatory regulation, we thus considered whether <b>POP</b> <b>2</b> is common in the mammalian lineage. Results BLAST searches revealed that <b>POP</b> <b>2</b> is absent from the available genomes of not only mice and rats, but those of other domestic mammals and New World monkeys as well. <b>POP</b> <b>2</b> is however present in the genome of the primate species most closely related to humans including Pan troglodytes (chimpanzees), Macaca mulatta (rhesus macaques) and others. Interestingly, chimpanzee <b>POP</b> <b>2</b> is identical to human <b>POP</b> <b>2</b> (huPOP 2) at both the DNA and protein level. Macaque <b>POP</b> <b>2</b> (mqPOP 2), although highly conserved is not identical to the human sequence; however, both functions of the human protein are retained. Further, <b>POP</b> <b>2</b> appears to have arisen in the mammalian genome relatively recently (~ 25 mya) and likely derived from retrogene insertion of NLRP 2. Conclusion Our findings support the hypothesis that the NLR loci of mammals, encoding proteins involved in innate and adaptive immunity as well as mammalian development, have been subject to recent and strong selective pressures. Since <b>POP</b> <b>2</b> is capable of regulating signaling events and processes linked to innate immunity and inflammation, its presence in the genomes of hominids and Old World primates further suggests that additional regulation of these signals is important in these species. </p...|$|R
40|$|We have {{isolated}} a new mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that {{exhibits a}} glucose-derepression resistant (and sucrose-non-fermentor) phenotype. This mutant {{was obtained by}} screening for overproduction of alpha-amylase in a strain containing the mouse alpha-amylase gene {{under the control of}} the PGK promoter. The mutation designated <b>pop</b> <b>2</b> (PGK promoter directed over production). The <b>pop</b> <b>2</b> mutant overproduced amylase 5 - 6 fold and displayed several other pleiotropic defects: (1) resistance to glucose derepression, (2) temperature-sensitive growth, (3) failure of homozygous diploid cells to sporulate and (4) reduced amount of reserve carbohydrates. We mapped <b>pop</b> <b>2</b> to chromosome XIV, distal to lys 9 and SUP 28, indicating that <b>POP</b> <b>2</b> is a newly-identified locus. We isolated the <b>POP</b> <b>2</b> gene from two yeast strains of different genetic backgrounds, S 288 C and A 364 A, and determined their nucleotide sequences. The predicted amino acid sequence of the <b>POP</b> <b>2</b> protein contains three glutamine-rich region, a proline-rich region and a serine/threonine-rich region, characteristic of many transcription factors. Steady state levels of RNA transcribed from the PGK-amylase fusion gene and from endogenous PGK gene in stationary-phase <b>pop</b> <b>2</b> cells were 5 - to 10 -fold higher than those observed in wild-type cells, showing that the <b>pop</b> <b>2</b> mutation affects transcription of the PGK gene transcription...|$|R
40|$|The <b>POP</b> <b>2</b> (Caf 1) {{protein in}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae affects {{a variety of}} {{transcriptional}} processes and is {{a component of the}} Ccr 4 p complex. We have isolated five multicopy suppressor genes of a <b>pop</b> <b>2</b> deletion mutation: CCR 4, DHH 1 (a putative RNA helicase), PKC 1, STM 1, and MPT 5 (multicopy suppressor of pop two). Overexpression of either the CCR 4 or DHH 1 genes effectively suppressed phenotypes associated with <b>pop</b> <b>2</b> mutant cells; overexpression of PKC 1, STM 1, or MPT 5 genes produced only partial suppression. Disruption of the CCR 4 or DHH 1 genes resulted in phenotypes similar to those observed for <b>pop</b> <b>2</b> cells. In addition, overexpression of the DHH 1 gene also suppressed the ccr 4 mutation, suggesting a close relationship between the <b>POP</b> <b>2,</b> CCR 4, and DHH 1 genes. Two-hybrid analysis and coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> p and Dhh 1 p interact physically, and these and other data suggest that Dhh 1 p is also a component of the Ccr 4 p complex. Finally, we investigated the genetic interaction between factors associated with <b>POP</b> <b>2</b> and the PKC 1 pathway. The temperature-sensitive growth defect of dhh 1 or mpt 5 cells was suppressed by overexpression of PKC 1, and the defect of mpk 1 cells was suppressed by overexpression of MPT 5. These results and phenotypic analysis of double mutants from the <b>POP</b> <b>2</b> and PKC 1 pathways suggested that the <b>POP</b> <b>2</b> and the PKC 1 pathways are independent but have some overlapping functions...|$|R
40|$|Protein Arginine {{methylation}} is {{an important}} post-translational modification that is vital in regulating various cellular processes such as gene transcription, cell signaling, and RNA processing. Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) are responsible for performing this important modification. PRMT 1 (protein arginine methyltransferase 1) and Hmt 1 (hnRNP methyltransferase 1) are the predominant PRMTs in humans and yeast, respectively. Despite growing momentum in this field, relatively little is understood about PRMT regulation. Further work discovering how PRMTs are regulated will greatly advance our understanding of diseases where PRMTs have been implicated, such as heart disease and cancer. It has been discovered that a human protein called hCaf 1 (human Ccr 4 -associated factor 1) is a regulator of PRMT 1 with respect to certain substrates, and also colocalizes with PRMT 1. We present data that suggest the yeast homolog of hCaf 1, <b>Pop</b> <b>2,</b> may also perform a similar function on Hmt 1. We provide data on the expression and purification of a truncation of <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> from S. cerevisiae, including the temperature sensitivity of one construct of <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> and its susceptibility to precipitation. We also demonstrated concentration-dependent inhibition of Hmt 1 -catalyzed methylation of histone H 4 by <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> in vitro. Yeast cell lysates also showed altered patterns of methylation in the presence and absence of <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> in vivo. In an effort to understand the mechanism employed by <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> to accomplish this regulatory function, pull-downs were performed suggesting that <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> directly interacts with histone H 4, a substrate of Hmt 1. Mutagenic studies with <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> suggested a region that {{may be responsible for}} this interaction. Given these data, we hypothesized that <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> is able to inhibit the methylation of histone H 4 via a substrate-sequestering mechanism. Further experimentation will determine the precise interaction surfaces of <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> and substrate, and continue to define the details of methylation inhibition by <b>Pop</b> <b>2,</b> including the scope of its influence in the cell...|$|R
40|$|PUFs are RNA binding {{proteins}} that promote mRNA deadenylation and decay and inhibit translation. Yeast Puf 5 is the prototype for studying PUF-dependent gene repression. Puf 5 binds to the <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> subunit of the Ccr 4 -Pop 2 -NOT mRNA deadenylase, recruiting the deadenylase and associated translational repressors to mRNAs. Here we used yeast genetics {{to show that}} Puf 5 has additional roles in vivo {{that do not require}} <b>Pop</b> <b>2.</b> Deletion of PUF 5 caused increased sensitivity to DNA replication stress in cells lacking <b>Pop</b> <b>2,</b> as well as in cells mutated for two activities recruited to mRNAs by the Puf 5 -Pop 2 interaction, the deadenylase Ccr 4 and the translational repressor Dhh 1. A functional Puf 5 RNA binding domain was required, and Puf 5 cytoplasmic localisation was sufficient for resistance to replication stress, indicating posttranscriptional gene expression control is involved. In contrast to DNA replication stress, in response to the cell wall integrity pathway activator caffeine, PUF 5 and <b>POP</b> <b>2</b> acted in the same genetic pathway, indicating that functions of Puf 5 in the caffeine response are mediated by <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> -dependent gene repression. Our results support a model in which Puf 5 uses multiple, <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> dependent and <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> -independent mechanisms to control mRNA expression. The <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> -independent roles for Puf 5 could involve spatial control of gene expression, a proposition supported by our data indicating that the active form of Puf 5 is localised to cytoplasmic foci...|$|R

Given these differences, we tested whether its deadenylase activity is conserved in the human homologs Caf 1 and <b>Pop</b> <b>2.</b> Our data demonstrate that both human factors degrade poly(A) tails indicating their involvement in mRNA metabolism...|$|R
40|$|ATP-gated P 2 X 7 {{receptor}} (P 2 RX 7) {{channel is}} a key component for purinergic signaling and plays important roles in the innate immune response in mammals. However, the expression, molecular properties and immune significances of P 2 RX 7 in lower vertebrates are still very limited. Here we identified and characterized a novel bony fish P 2 RX 7 homologue cDNA, termed <b>poP</b> <b>2</b> RX 7, in Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). <b>PoP</b> <b>2</b> RX 7 protein shares about 60 – 88 % sequence similarity and 45 – 78 % sequence identity with known vertebrate P 2 RX 7 proteins. Phylogenetic analysis placed <b>poP</b> <b>2</b> RX 7 and other P 2 RX 7 proteins within their own cluster apart from other P 2 RX members. While the functional <b>poP</b> <b>2</b> RX 7 channel shares structural features in common with known P 2 RX 7 homologs, electrophysiological studies revealed that BzATP, the more potent agonist for known mammalian and fish P 2 RX 7 s, shows similar potency to ATP in <b>poP</b> <b>2</b> RX 7 activation. <b>poP</b> <b>2</b> RX 7 mRNA constitutively expressed in all examined tissues from unstimulated healthy Japanese flounder with dominant expression in hepatopancreas and the lowest expression in head kidney, trunk kidney, spleen and gill. <b>poP</b> <b>2</b> RX 7 mRNA expression, however, was significantly induced in Japanese flounder head kidney primary cells by Poly(I:C) and bacterial endotoxin LPS stimulations. In vivo experiments further revealed that <b>poP</b> <b>2</b> RX 7 gene expression was substantially up-regulated by immune challenge with infectious bacteria Edwardsiella tarda and Vibrio anguillarum.

40|$|PUF {{proteins}} control {{gene expression}} by binding to the 3 �-untranslated regions of specific mRNAs and triggering mRNA decay or translational repression. Here {{we focus on}} the mechanism of PUF-mediated regulation. The yeast PUF protein, Mpt 5 p, regulates HO mRNA and stimulates removal of its poly(A) tail (i. e. deadenylation). Mpt 5 p repression in vivo is dependent on <b>POP</b> <b>2,</b> a component of the cytoplasmic Ccr 4 p-Pop 2 p-Not complex that deadenylates mRNAs. In this study, we elucidate the individual roles of the Ccr 4 p and <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> p deadenylases in Mpt 5 p-regulated deadenylation. Both in vivo and in vitro, <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> p and Ccr 4 p proteins are required for Mpt 5 p-regulated deadenylation of HO. However, the requirements for the two proteins differ dramatically: the enzymatic activity of Ccr 4 p is essential, whereas that of <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> p is dispensable. We conclude that <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> p is a bridge through which the PUF protein recruit...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDuring {{angiosperm}} reproduction, pollen grains form a {{tube that}} navigates through female tissues to the micropyle, delivering sperm to the egg; the signals that mediate this process are poorly understood. Here, we describe {{a role for}} γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) in pollen tube growth and guidance. In vitro, GABA stimulates pollen tube growth, although vast excesses are inhibitory. The Arabidopsis <b>POP</b> <b>2</b> gene encodes a transaminase that degrades GABA and contributes {{to the formation of}} a gradient leading up to the micropyle. <b>pop</b> <b>2</b> flowers accumulate GABA, and the growth of many <b>pop</b> <b>2</b> pollen tubes is arrested, consistent with their in vitro GABA hypersensitivity. Some <b>pop</b> <b>2</b> tubes continue to grow toward ovules, yet they are misguided, presumably because they target ectopic GABA on the ovule surface. Interestingly, wild-type tubes exhibit normal growth and guidance in <b>pop</b> <b>2</b> pistils, perhaps by degrading excess GABA and sharpening the gradient leading to the micropyle...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background SCF {{ubiquitin}} ligases {{share the}} core subunits cullin 1, SKP 1, and HRT 1 /RBX 1 /ROC 1, which associate with different F-box proteins. F-box proteins bind substrates following their phosphorylation upon stimulation of various signaling pathways. Ubiquitin-mediated {{destruction of the}} fission yeast cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Rum 1 p depends on two heterooligomerizing F-box proteins, Pop 1 p and <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> p. Both proteins interact with the cullin Pcu 1 p when overexpressed, but it is unknown whether this reflects their co-assembly into bona fide SCF complexes. Results We have identified Psh 1 p and Pip 1 p, the fission yeast homologues of human SKP 1 and HRT 1 /RBX 1 /ROC 1, and show that both associate with Pop 1 p, <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> p, and Pcu 1 p into a ~ 500 kDa SCF <b>Pop</b> 1 p-Pop <b>2</b> p complex, which supports polyubiquitylation of Rum 1 p. Only the F-box of Pop 1 p is required for SCF <b>Pop</b> 1 p-Pop <b>2</b> p function, while <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> p seems to be attracted into the complex through binding to Pop 1 p. Since all SCF <b>Pop</b> 1 p-Pop <b>2</b> p subunits, except for Pop 1 p, which is exclusively nuclear, localize to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, the F-box of <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> p may be critical for the assembly of cytoplasmic SCF <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> p complexes. In support of this notion, we demonstrate individual SCF Pop 1 p and SCF <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> p complexes bearing ubiquitin ligase activity. Conclusion Our data suggest that distinct homo- and heterooligomeric assemblies of Pop 1 p and <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> p generate combinatorial diversity of SCF Pop function in fission yeast. Whereas a heterooligomeric SCF <b>Pop</b> 1 p-Pop <b>2</b> p complex mediates polyubiquitylation of Rum 1 p, homooligomeric SCF Pop 1 p and SCF <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> p complexes may target unknown nuclear and cytoplasmic substrates. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: The c-aminubutyrate (GABA) shunt {{bypasses}} {{two steps}} of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and is present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In plants, the pathway is composed of the calcium/calmodulin-regulated cytosolic enzyme glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), the mitochondrial enzymes GABA transaminase (GABA-T; <b>POP</b> <b>2)</b> and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH). We have previously shown that compromising {{the function of the}} GABA-shunt, by disrupting the SSADH gene of Arabidopsis, causes enhanced accumulation of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs) and cell death in response to light and heat stress. However, to date, genetic investigations of the relationships between enzymes of the GABA shunt have not been reported. Principal Findings: To elucidate the role of succinic semialdehyde (SSA), c-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and GABA in the accumulation of ROIs, we combined two genetic approaches to suppress the severe phenotype of ssadh mutants. Analysis of double <b>pop</b> <b>2</b> ssadh mutants revealed that <b>pop</b> <b>2</b> is epistatic to ssadh.

We found that the 97 th threonine residue (Thr 97) of <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> p was phosphorylated upon glucose limitation. The Thr 97 phosphorylation occurred within 2 min after removing glucose and was reversed within 1 min after the readdition of glucose. The effects of hexokinase mutations and glucose analogs indicate that this phosphorylation is dependent on glucose phosphorylating activity. We purified a protein kinase that phosphorylates a peptide containing Thr 97 of <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> p and identified it as Yak 1 p, a DYRK family kinase.

40|$|Protein {{conformational}} maladies such as Huntington Disease {{are characterized}} by accumulation of intracellular and extracellular protein inclusions containing amyloid-like proteins. There is an inverse correlation between proteotoxicity and aggregation, so facilitated protein aggregation appears cytoprotective. To define mechanisms for protective protein aggregation, a screen for suppressors of nuclear huntingtin (Htt 103 Q) toxicity was conducted. Nuclear Htt 103 Q is highly toxic and less aggregation prone than its cytosolic form, so we identified suppressors of cytotoxicity caused by Htt 103 Q tagged with a nuclear localization signal (NLS). High copy suppressors of Htt 103 Q-NLS toxicity include the polyQ-domain containing proteins Nab 3, <b>Pop</b> <b>2,</b> and Cbk 1, and each suppresses Htt toxicity via a different mechanism. Htt 103 Q-NLS appears to inactivate the essential functions of Nab 3 in RNA processing in the nucleus. Function of <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> and Cbk 1 is not impaired by nuclear Htt 103 Q, as their respective polyQ-rich domains are sufficient to suppress Htt 103 Q toxicity. <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> is a subunit of an RNA processing complex and is localized throughout the cytoplasm. Expression of just the <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> polyQ domain and an adjacent proline-rich stretch is sufficient to suppress Htt 103 Q toxicity. The proline-rich domain in <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> resembles an aggresome targeting signal, so <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> may act in trans to positively impact spatial quality control of Htt 103 Q. Cbk 1 accumulates in discrete perinuclear foci and overexpression of the Cbk 1 polyQ domain concentrates diffuse Htt 103 Q into these foci, which correlates with suppression of Htt toxicity. Protective action of <b>Pop</b> <b>2</b> and Cbk 1 in spatial quality control is dependent upon the Hsp 70 co-chaperone Sti 1, which packages amyloid-like proteins into benign foci. Protein:protein interactions between Htt 103 Q and its intracellular neighbors lead to toxic and protective outcomes.
