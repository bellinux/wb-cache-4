5|$|Critics of Plantinga's argument, such as {{philosophers}} Antony Flew, {{have responded}} that it presupposes a libertarian, incompatibilist view {{of free will}} (free will and determinism are metaphysically incompatible), while their view is a compatibilist view of free will (free will and determinism, whether physical or divine, are metaphysically compatible). The view of compatibilists is that God could have created a world containing moral good but no moral evil.

25|$|The League of Nations {{attempted}} to play its role of ensuring world {{peace in the}} 1920s and 30s, although with the increasingly revisionist and aggressive behaviour of Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan, it ultimately failed to maintain <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> order. Economic sanctions were used against states that committed aggression, such as Italy when it invaded Abyssinia, {{but there was no}} will {{on the part of the}} principal League powers, Britain and France, to subordinate their interests to a multilateral process or to disarm at all themselves.|$|E
25|$|Astronomers {{for many}} years ruled out red dwarfs as {{potential}} abodes for life. Their small size (from 0.08 to 0.45 solar masses) means that their nuclear reactions proceed exceptionally slowly, and they emit very little light (from 3% of that produced by the Sun to as little as 0.01%). Any planet in orbit around a red dwarf would have to huddle very close to its parent star to attain Earth-like surface temperatures; from 0.3 AU (just inside the orbit of Mercury) for a star like Lacaille 8760, to as little as 0.032 AU for a star like Proxima Centauri (<b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> would have a year lasting just 6.3 days). At those distances, the star's gravity would cause tidal locking. One side of the planet would eternally face the star, while the other would always face away from it. The only ways in which potential life could avoid either an inferno or a deep freeze {{would be if the}} planet had an atmosphere thick enough to transfer the star's heat from the day side to the night side, or if there was a gas giant in the habitable zone, with a habitable moon, which would be locked to the planet instead of the star, allowing a more even distribution of radiation over the planet. It was long assumed that such a thick atmosphere would prevent sunlight from reaching the surface in the first place, preventing photosynthesis.|$|E

[...] The party did also not have any faith in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> community or international legal system, questioning the entire logic behind the UN. It rejected the view of any international consensus about concepts as democracy, justice, freedom and human rights, especially since most of its member countries are non-Western and undemocratic.|$|E

500|$|... "God Help the Outcasts" [...] {{was adapted}} {{for the stage}} version of The Hunchback of Notre Dame, which premiered in a 1999 German {{production}} entitled Der Glöckner von Notre Dame. Called Hilf den Verstoß'nen in German, this rendition is a duet between Esmerelda and Quasimodo, and was originally performed by Judy Weiss and Drew Sarich respectively. Stephen Schwartz said [...] "the scene...with all its candles and projected re-creation of Notre Dame, I thought was absolutely stunning". Reviewer Edward R. Cox wrote [...] "The addition of Quasi to this song adds <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> of unity to the pleas of Esmeralda and the parishoners [...] show his pure compassion for other's pain, unselfishly. A brilliant stage device and moment". The Hunchblog noted turning this song into a duet means Esmerelda gets no solos in the musical. In the 2014-5 La Jolla Playhouse/Paper Mill Playhouse English production, the song was reverted to a solo.|$|E
500|$|The value Hick {{placed on}} free will {{was the result}} of his belief that it is {{necessary}} for genuine love: he believed that love which is not freely chosen is valueless. A genuinely loving God, he argued, would have created humans with free will. Hick held that it would be possible for God to create beings that would always freely choose to do good, but argued that a genuine relationship requires the possibility of rejection. Irenaeus' notion of humans existing at an [...] "epistemic distance" [...] from God also influenced Hick, as it would ensure a free choice in belief in God. Hick argued that a world without pain or suffering would prevent moral development; <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> would have no fixed structure, or have a structure subject to divine intervention, preventing humans from coming to any harm. Hick argued that this would leave humans unable to help or harm one another, allowing them no moral choices and so preventing moral development.|$|E
500|$|Welles said, [...] "the {{film was}} not {{intended}} as a lament for Falstaff, but {{for the death of}} Merrie England. Merrie England as a conception, a myth which has been very real to the English-speaking world, and is to some extent expressed in other countries of the Medieval epoch: the age of chivalry, of simplicity, of Maytime and all that. It is more than Falstaff who is dying. It's the old England dying and betrayed." [...] Many film theorists and Welles biographers have written about the recurrent theme of the [...] "Lost Eden" [...] in Welles's work and of characters who are nostalgic for an idealized past, which Welles called [...] "the central theme in Western culture." [...] Welles told Peter Bogdanovich that [...] "even if the good old days never existed, the fact that we can conceive of <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> is, in fact, an affirmation of the human spirit." [...] Film scholar Beverle Houston argued that this nostalgia made Welles's depiction of Falstaff infantile and called his performance a [...] "ower baby...an eating, sucking, foetus-like creature." [...] Welles also called Falstaff [...] "the greatest conception of a good man, the most completely good man, in all of drama", and said that [...] "the closer I thought I was getting to Falstaff the less funny he seemed to me. When I played him before in the theater, he seemed more witty than comical. And in bringing him to the screen, I found him only occasionally, and only deliberately, a clown." ...|$|E

500|$|Noam Chomsky {{has argued}} that forces {{opposing}} the development of <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> conscience include free market ideologies that valorise corporate greed in nominal electoral democracies where advertising, shopping malls and indebtedness, shape citizens into apathetic consumers in relation to information and access necessary for democratic participation. John Passmore {{has argued that}} mystical considerations about the global expansion of all human consciousness, should {{take into account that}} if as a species we do become something much superior to what we are now, it will be as a consequence of conscience not only implanting a goal of moral perfectibility, but assisting us to remain periodically anxious, passionate and discontented, for these are necessary components of care and compassion. The Committee on Conscience of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum has targeted genocides such as those in Rwanda, Bosnia, Darfur, the Congo and Chechnya as challenges to the world's conscience. Oscar Arias Sanchez has criticised global arms industry spending as a failure of conscience by nation states: [...] "When a country decides to invest in arms, rather than in education, housing, the environment, and health services for its people, it is depriving a whole generation of its right to prosperity and happiness. We have produced one firearm for every ten inhabitants of this planet, and yet we have not bothered to end hunger when such a feat is well within our reach. This is not a necessary or inevitable state of affairs. It is a deliberate choice" [...] (see Campaign Against Arms Trade). US House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, after meeting with the 14th Dalai Lama during the 2008 violent protests in Tibet and aftermath said: [...] "The situation in Tibet is a challenge to the conscience of the world." [...] Nelson Mandela, through his example and words, has been described as having shaped the conscience of the world. [...] The Right Livelihood Award is awarded yearly in Sweden to those people, mostly strongly motivated by conscience, who have made exemplary practical contributions to resolving the great challenges facing our planet and its people. In 2009, for example, along with Catherine Hamlin (obstetric fistula and see fistula foundation)), David Suzuki (promoting awareness of climate change) and Alyn Ware (nuclear disarmament), René Ngongo shared the Right Livelihood Award [...] "for his courage in confronting the forces that are destroying the Congo Basin's rainforests and building political support for their conservation and sustainable use". Avaaz {{is one of the largest}} global on-line organizations launched in January 2007 to promote conscience-driven activism on issues such as climate change, human rights, animal rights, corruption, poverty, and conflict, thus [...] "closing the gap between the world we have and the world most people everywhere want".|$|E

2500|$|Epiphenomenal ectoplasm was {{proposed}} by Horgan and Lewis in 1983, {{in which they}} stated, a possible world (a world that could possibly exist) W is identical to our world {{in the distribution of}} all mental and physical characteristics (i.e. they are identical), except world W contains an experience called epiphenomenal ectoplasm that does not causally interact with that world. If supervenience physicalism is true, then <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> could not exist because a physical duplicate of the actual world (the world that is known to exist) could not possess an epiphenomenal ectoplasm. This was rectified by Frank Jackson, by adjusting the application of supervenience within physicalism to state [...] "Physicalism is true at a possible world W if and only if any world which is a minimal physical duplicate (i.e. identical) of W is a duplicate of W simpliciter." ...|$|E
2500|$|Syaoran {{was born}} in a modern Japan, where his father passed him his name, [...] Syaoran was sent by Yūko to Kingdom of Clow, as his mother had {{foreseen}} a future which involved him in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>world.</b> There, he met the original Sakura, with whom he started bonding, promising he would protect her. When Fei-Wang placed a death seal on Sakura, Syaoran stayed in Clow for seven years with no means of returning and traveled {{all over the world to}} different countries, in order to find a way to remove the seal. Just before Sakura's death, Syaoran was granted a wish to turn back time by Yūko, but at the price of losing his freedom to Fei-Wang who started to create his and Sakura's clones. Kimihiro Watanuki was created to replace Syaoran within his original world, and Syaoran also used his payment to protect Watanuki from dangers.|$|E
2500|$|To {{the ideological}} right, {{the line between}} Haredi and Modern Orthodox has blurred in recent years; some have {{referred}} to this trend as [...] "haredization". In addition to increasing stringency in adherence to Halakha, many Modern Orthodox Jews express {{a growing sense of}} alienation from the larger, secular culture. ("Western civilisation has moved from what was once called the Judeo-Christian ethic to a consumer-driven, choice-fixated culture.... <b>Such</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> is not chol, but chiloni, not secular, but secularist.

2500|$|Howard {{found himself}} on Earth due to a shift in [...] "the Cosmic Axis" [...] from a world similar to Earth, but where there are [...] "more ducks" [...] and [...] "apes don't talk". In the {{black-and-white}} Howard the Duck magazine series, writer Bill Mantlo theorized that Howard came from an extra-dimensional planet called Duckworld, a planet similar to Earth where ducks, not apes, had evolved to become the dominant species. In 2001, Gerber dismissed this idea, calling it [...] "very pedestrian" [...] and 'comic-booky' — in the worst sense of the term." [...] He believes Howard came from an alternate Earth populated {{by a variety of}} cartoon animals. A panel in Fear #19, prior to Howard's introduction, depicts Howard or someone like him near an anthropomorphic mouse and an anthropomorphic dog, in a hypothetical panel about other dimensions. [...] Destroyer Duck was depicted existing in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>world,</b> and in Howard the Duck vol. 2 #6, Howard mentions that Moses is believed to be a moose in his world and Yeshua a flying squirrel.|$|E
2500|$|Not all {{interpretations of}} global {{citizenship}} are positive. For example, Parekh advocates {{what he calls}} globally oriented citizenship, and states, [...] "If global citizenship means being {{a citizen of the}} world, it is neither practicable nor desirable." [...] He argues that global citizenship, defined as an actual membership of a type of worldwide government system, is impractical and dislocated from one's immediate community. He also notes that <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> state would inevitably be [...] "remote, bureaucratic, oppressive, and culturally bland." [...] Parekh presents his alternate option with the statement: [...] "Since the conditions of life of our fellow human beings in distant parts of the world should be a matter of deep moral and political concern to us, our citizenship has an inescapable global dimension, and we should aim to become what I might call a globally oriented citizen." [...] Parekh's concept of globally oriented citizenship consists of identifying with and strengthening ties towards one's political regional community (whether in its current state or an improved, revised form), while recognizing and acting upon obligations towards others {{in the rest of the}} world.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sense of}} an enlightened {{approach}} and the critical method required that [...] "If one cannot prove that a thing is, he may try {{to prove that it}} is not.

Hence the question no longer is as to whether perpetual peace is a real thing or not a real thing, or as to whether we may not be deceiving ourselves when we adopt the former alternative, but we must act on the supposition of its being real." [...] The presupposition of God, soul, and freedom was then a practical concern, for [...] "Morality, by itself, constitutes a system, but happiness does not, unless it is distributed in exact proportion to morality. This, however, is possible in an intelligible world only under a wise author and ruler. Reason compels us to admit such a ruler, together with life in <b>such</b> <b>a</b> <b>world,</b> which we must consider as future life, or else all moral laws are to be considered as idle dreams..." ...|$|E
