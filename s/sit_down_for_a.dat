25|$|One {{privilege}} of student life at Cambridge {{is the opportunity}} to attend formal dinners at college. These are called Formal Hall and occur regularly during term time. Students <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> meal in their gowns, while Fellows eat separately at High Table: {{the beginning and end of}} the function is usually marked with a grace. Special formal halls are organised for events such as Christmas and the Commemoration of Benefactors.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell) {{is upset}} that Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) is {{cross-dressing}} on TGS {{because it is}} demeaning to African-Americans. After a bit of objection, Toofer convinces Tracy to stop, handing the female character over to Josh Girard (Lonny Ross). Once Josh's character is successful, Tracy is upset with Toofer. Liz convinces Toofer to work with Tracy. As they work together, Tracy gets upset with Toofer's supposed lack of blackness, and endearingly calls Toofer a racial slur. The next morning, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), Liz, Toofer, and Tracy <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> meeting about Tracy's vocabulary from the previous night. Tracy and Jack {{point out that the}} African-American community has adopted the word to deprive it of its meaning. In trying to reach out to Tracy, Toofer says the word again but because of his perceived cultural whiteness, everyone, including Tracy, is offended in a way they weren't when Tracy used the term. Tracy and Toofer attend sensitivity training, start arguing, and in the process develop a new sketch for TGS. When show starts running short on time, Liz offers Tracy the option to either air the sketch or one from the Star Jones cooking show, Tracy chooses the latter. Toofer is initially upset, but agrees with Tracy's decision when he finds the sketch funny.|$|E
2500|$|Care for the gods, {{the very}} meaning of religio, had {{therefore}} {{to go through}} life, and one might thus understand why Cicero wrote that religion was [...] "necessary". Religious behavior – pietas in Latin, eusebeia in Greek – belonged to action and not to contemplation. Consequently religious acts took place wherever the faithful were: in houses, boroughs, associations, cities, military camps, cemeteries, in the country, on boats. 'When pious travelers happen to pass by a sacred grove or a cult place on their way, {{they are used to}} make a vow, or a fruit offering, or to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while' (Apuleius, Florides 1.1).|$|E

2500|$|One {{biography}} of Orwell {{accused him of}} having had an authoritarian streak. In Burma, he struck out at a Burmese boy who, while [...] "fooling around" [...] with his friends, had [...] "accidentally bumped into him" [...] at a station, resulting in Orwell falling [...] "heavily" [...] down some stairs. One of his former pupils recalled being beaten so hard he could not <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> week. When sharing a flat with Orwell, Heppenstall came home late one night in an advanced stage of loud inebriation. The upshot was that Heppenstall {{ended up with a}} bloody nose and was locked in a room. When he complained, Orwell hit him across the legs with a shooting stick and Heppenstall then had to defend himself with a chair. Years later, after Orwell's death, Heppenstall wrote a dramatic account of the incident called [...] "The Shooting Stick" [...] and Mabel Fierz confirmed that Heppenstall came to her in a sorry state the following day.|$|E
2500|$|Another alleged {{inventor}} of the hamburger is the cook Fletcher Davis (better known as [...] "Old Dave"), {{who claimed to have}} had the idea of putting ground beef between two pieces of Texas Toast when one of his customers was in too much of a hurry to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> meal. The customer walked away with his Hamburger Steak and seemed so content that Old Dave offered his new carryout meal as a staple menu item at the end of 1880 in Athens, Texas. Fletcher had a stall with his wife at the St. Louis World's Fair of 1904. Texan journalist Frank X. Tolbert mentions a salesman named Fletcher Davis who served hamburgers in a café at 115 Tyler Street in Athens during the late 1880s. The locals claim that Davis was selling beef sandwiches during that time, without having a clear name for his invention. During the 1980s, the Dairy Queen ice cream chain filmed a documentary about the birthplace of the hamburger featuring Davis' story. The story of [...] "Old Dave's Hamburger Sandwich" [...] is also found mentioned in Ronald L. McDonald's book The Complete Hamburger.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the same}} interview, {{explaining}} why he thinks the art of traditional storytelling is disappearing, Hamilton suggests that we have become [...] "obsessed by modern technology and social networking sites and computer games and television {{to the point where}} we struggle to <b>sit</b> <b>down</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> hour or so to listen"; that this has had a detrimental effect on our concentration span; and that even Moroccans are [...] "in a hurry" [...] and similarly affected by such changes these days.|$|R

He specifically tells Hacker to look in the bottom of his fifth red box that evening to find Sir Humphrey's reasons for not proceeding with the proposed safeguards for the National Integrated Database.|$|R
