5|$|The committee's {{final report}} {{determined}} that along {{the whole of}} the rocky coast between Land's End and Hartland Point, Padstow was the only potentially safe harbour for the coasting trade when the most dangerous north-westerly onshore gales were blowing. It noted that Padstow's safety was compromised by the Doom Bar and by the eddy-forming effect of <b>Stepper</b> Point. The report recommended initial expenditure of £20,000 to cut down the outer part of <b>Stepper</b> Point, which, in conjunction with the capstans, bollards and mooring rings, would significantly reduce the risk to shipping.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the twentieth}} century, access to Padstow's harbour was via a narrow channel between the Doom Bar and the cliffs at <b>Stepper</b> Point, a {{difficult}} passage for sailing ships to navigate especially in north-westerly gales when the cliffs would {{cut off the}} wind. Many ships were wrecked on the Doom Bar, despite the installation of mooring rings and capstans on the cliffs and quarrying away part of <b>Stepper</b> Point to improve the wind. In {{the early twentieth century}} the main channel moved away from the cliffs, and continued dredging has made it much safer for boats, but deaths have occurred on the bar as recently as 1997.|$|E
5|$|From <b>Stepper</b> Point {{the path}} again runs along low sea cliffs to Trevone and Harlyn Bay then around Trevose Head. From here-—weather permitting-—the coast {{can be seen}} from Hartland in Devon to beyond St Ives in the west. The path runs southwards through Constantine Bay to Porthcothan then passes around Park Head to reach Mawgan Porth.|$|E

2500|$|In <b>Steppers,</b> {{the bass}} drum plays every quarter {{beat of the}} bar, giving the beat an insistent drive. An example is [...] "Exodus" [...] by Bob Marley and the Wailers. Another common name for the <b>Steppers</b> beat is the [...] "four on the floor". Burning Spear's 1975 song [...] "Red, Gold, and Green" [...] (with Leroy Wallace on drums) {{is one of the}} {{earliest}} examples. The <b>Steppers</b> beat was adopted (at a much higher tempo) by some 2 Tone ska revival bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s.|$|R
5|$|Larger boats {{entering}} Padstow {{were offered}} assistance, generally by pilots who would wait at <b>Stepper</b> Point when a ship signalled {{it would be}} entering. If a boat was foundering, salvors would step in and help. There were cases where salvors attempted to overstate the danger in court, so as to extort more money from the owners. This happened to the brig The Towan, which foundered in October 1843 but was not in significant danger. Although it did not need assistance, salvors interfered and attempted to claim a large amount in compensation from the owner.|$|E
25|$|<b>Stepper</b> motors {{were and}} still are often used in {{computer}} printers, optical scanners, and digital photocopiers to move the optical scanning element, the print head carriage (of dot matrix and inkjet printers), and the platen or feed rollers. Likewise, many computer plotters (which since the early 1990s have been replaced with large-format inkjet and laser printers) used rotary <b>stepper</b> motors for pen and platen movement; the typical alternatives here were either linear <b>stepper</b> motors or servomotors with closed-loop analog control systems.|$|E
25|$|Closely {{related in}} design to {{three-phase}} AC synchronous motors, <b>stepper</b> motors and SRMs {{are classified as}} variable reluctance motor type. <b>Stepper</b> motors were and still are often used in computer printers, optical scanners, and computer numerical control (CNC) machines such as routers, plasma cutters and CNC lathes.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of intelligent fixtures employ arc lamps {{as a light}} source, and therefore {{use a variety of}} mechanical methods to achieve the effect of dimming. Some fixtures employ standard halogen lamps. Mechanically, <b>stepper</b> motors connected to various internal optical devices (such as gobos and color wheels) manipulate the light before it escapes the fixture's front lens.|$|E
25|$|Ball {{bearings}} {{designed to}} support high speeds and temperatures are sometimes {{used instead of}} fluid bearings to support the turbine shaft. This helps the turbocharger accelerate more quickly and reduces turbo lag. Some variable nozzle turbochargers use a rotary electric actuator, which uses a direct <b>stepper</b> motor to open and close the vanes, rather than pneumatic controllers that operate based on air pressure.|$|E
25|$|A rather simple {{example is}} the {{stabilization}} of the position and direction of laser beam between modules in a large free space optical communication system. Fourier optics is used to control both direction and position. The actual beam is measured by photo diodes. This signal is fed into some Analog-to-digital converters and a microcontroller runs a PID controller algorithm. The controller drives some digital-to-analog converters which drive <b>stepper</b> motors attached to mirror mounts.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the muscular contributions to the stepping phase of recovery from forward loss of balance in 5 young and 5 older adults that were able to recover balance in a single step, and 5 older adults that required multiple steps. Forward loss of balance was achieved by releasing participants from a static forward lean angle. All participants were instructed to attempt to recover balance by taking a rapid single step. A scalable anatomical model consisting of 36 degrees-of-freedom was used to compute kinematics and joint moments from motion capture and force plate data. Forces for 94 muscle actuators were computed using static optimisation and induced acceleration analysis was used to compute individual muscle contributions to net lumbar spine joint, and stepping side hip joint and knee joint accelerations during recovery. Older adults that required multiple recovery steps used a significantly shorter and faster initial recovery step and adopted significantly more trunk flexion throughout recovery compared to the older single <b>steppers.</b> Older multiple <b>steppers</b> also produced significantly more force in the stance side hamstrings, which resulted in significantly higher hamstring induced flexion accelerations at the lumbar spine and extension accelerations at the hip. However since the net joint lumbar spine and hip accelerations remained similar between older multiple <b>steppers</b> and older single <b>steppers,</b> we suggest that the recovery strategy adopted by older multiple <b>steppers</b> was less efficient as well as less effective than for older single <b>steppers.</b> No Full Tex...|$|R

25|$|On 18 August 1816, Whiting, {{under the}} command of Lieutenant John Jackson, was ordered to leave Plymouth and sail around Land's End to the Irish Sea to counter {{smuggling}} in the area. On 15 September 1816, to escape a gale, Jackson took his vessel into harbour at Padstow on the north coast of Cornwall. The wind dropped as they came around <b>Stepper</b> Point, and the ship ran aground on the Doom Bar as the tide was ebbing, stranding her.|$|E
25|$|The LSU Strength and Conditioning {{facility}} or LSU North Stadium weight room, is {{a strength}} training and conditioning facility at Louisiana State University. Built in 1997, {{it is located}} adjacent to the stadium. Measuring 10,000-square feet with a flat surface, it has 28 multi-purpose power stations, 36 assorted selectorized machines and 10 dumbbell stations along with a plyometric specific area, medicine balls, hurdles, plyometric boxes and assorted speed and agility equipment. It also features 2 treadmills, 4 stationary bikes, 2 elliptical cross trainers, a <b>stepper</b> and stepmill.|$|E
25|$|Pieces {{that can}} slide forward promote far {{more easily than}} steppers or jumpers. As the board thins out their {{promotion}} becomes unavoidable, while steppers can almost always be met by an opponent <b>stepper</b> to neutralize it {{by the time it}} arrives at the promotion zone. The potential promotion gain of the sliders is thus always {{an important part of the}} material balance, but if it makes up too large a part of your total strength, you might be overwhelmed before you can develop this potential.|$|E

25|$|Diodes are {{frequently}} used to conduct damaging high voltages away from sensitive electronic devices. They are usually reverse-biased (non-conducting) under normal circumstances. When the voltage {{rises above the}} normal range, the diodes become forward-biased (conducting). For example, diodes are used in (<b>stepper</b> motor and H-bridge) motor controller and relay circuits to de-energize coils rapidly without the damaging voltage spikes that would otherwise occur. (A diode used in such an application is called a flyback diode). Many integrated circuits also incorporate diodes on the connection pins to prevent external voltages from damaging their sensitive transistors. Specialized diodes are used to protect from over-voltages at higher power (see Diode types above).|$|E
25|$|A CNC wood router is a {{computer}} controlled machine to which the router or spindle mounts. The CNC Machine can be either a moving gantry style, where the table is fixed and the router spindle moves over it, or fixed bridge design, where the table moves underneath the router spindle. CAD/CAM software programming is used to model the part {{that is to be}} created in the computer and then create a tool path for the machine to follow to cut out the part. The CNC moves along three axes (X-Y-Z). Most CNC routers have a three motor drive system utilizing either servo or <b>stepper</b> motors. More advanced routers use a four motor system for added speed and accuracy.|$|E
25|$|In modern drives, {{there is}} one head for each {{magnetic}} platter surface on the spindle, mounted on a common arm. An actuator arm (or access arm) moves the heads on an arc (roughly radially) across the platters as they spin, allowing each head to access almost the entire surface of the platter as it spins. The arm is moved using a voice coil actuator or in some older designs a <b>stepper</b> motor. Early hard disk drives wrote data at some constant bits per second, resulting in all tracks having {{the same amount of}} data per track but modern drives (since the 1990s) use zone bit recording – increasing the write speed from inner to outer zone and thereby storing more data per track in the outer zones.|$|E
