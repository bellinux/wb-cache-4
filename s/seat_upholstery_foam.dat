40|$|The {{weight of}} textile {{components}} in automobiles {{is expected to}} rise to 35 kg by 2020, and the average lifetime of a vehicle is about 12 years. Car seats are {{the most important part of}} the interior decoration, and polyester is the most widely used material in car seat covering. Abrasion resistance tests are used to quantify the duration of car <b>seat</b> <b>upholstery</b> in normal usage, and this is one of the most important requirements. Several testing methods, standards, and car producer specifications have been developed to define the abrasion resistance of specified materials, and pre-tests have been taken to identify parameters for this research.

40|$|Furniture {{waste is}} mainly {{composed}} {{of wood and}} <b>upholstery</b> <b>foam</b> (mostly polyurethane foam). Both of these have a high calorific value, therefore, energy recovery would be an appropriate process to manage these wastes. Nevertheless, the drawback is that the energy content of these wastes is limited due to their low density mainly that of <b>upholstery</b> <b>foam.</b> Densification of separate foam presents difficulties due to its elastic character. The significance of this work lies in obtaining densified material by co-densification of furniture wood waste and polyurethane foam waste. Densification of furniture wood and the co-densification of furniture wood waste with polyurethane foam have been studied. On the one hand, the parameters that {{have an effect on}} the quality of the furniture waste briquettes have been analysed, i. e., moisture content, compaction pressure, presence of lignin, etc. The maximum weight percentage of polyurethane foam that can be added with furniture wood waste to obtain durable briquettes and the optimal moisture were determined. On the other hand, some parameters were analysed in order to evaluate the possible effect on the combustion. The chemical composition of waste wood was compared with untreated wood biomass; the higher nitrogen content and the concentration of some metals were the most important differences, with a significant difference of Ti content. Support for this work was provided by the Spanish Ministerio de Economia y Competividad, Research Project CTQ 2013 - 41006 -R (Spain), and PROMETEOII/ 2014 / 007 from Conselleria dâ€™EducaciÃ³, Cultura i Esport (Generalitat Valenciana, Spain) ...|$|R

50|$|The {{idea was}} to attract racers {{who did not have}} the budgets that were {{required}} in the GT category as well as an emphasis on compact sedans such as the AMC Gremlin and the Opel Manta. There were two classes from 1970 through 1973: Class A for under two liters and under 1.6 liters with overhead cam and Class B for over 1.6 L with overhead cam and over two liters up to the largest permitted engine being the 232 cuin L AMC Gremlin. In 1974 all cars were placed in one class, with the only parity for the smaller engines being free carburetion for under 1.6 liters. Limited preparation was permitted, and since the entrants were meant to be street-driven race cars, the original rules required the retention of headlights, <b>seats,</b> <b>upholstery,</b> window cranks, stock brakes and original springs and radial tires. Only the exhaust systems and shock absorbers were free. Later rules regarding headlights, <b>seats,</b> <b>upholstery,</b> window cranks, original springs, and other stock elements were loosened up somewhat. From the beginning, engine modifications similar to Sports Car Club of America B Sedan were permitted, with the main difference being that over-boring cylinders was not allowed, and stock carburetors being required, but modifications allowed. In addition, springs and alignment were free. The series was loosely based on rival SCCA Trans-Am's Two-Five Challenge rules.|$|R

50|$|Barber {{chairs in}} {{engravings}} from the Civil War era share many features with modern chairs, including high <b>seating,</b> <b>upholstery,</b> and a footrest. The first factory-manufactured chairs date to around 1850. The first one-piece reclining barber chair with an attached footrest was patented in 1878 by the Archer Company of Saint Louis. Archer quickly followed {{it with a}} chair that raised and lowered mechanically. Eugene Berninghaus of Cincinnati improved on Archer's design with the first reclining and revolving chair, the Paragon. Theodore Koch of Chicago incorporated all of these innovations into his chairs, selling more than 35,000 chairs in the period before 1885.|$|R
