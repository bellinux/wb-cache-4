2500|$|Further {{description}} of a San Joaquin soil profile was given in the Soil Manual as follows: [...] "The surface soil reported as a reddish brown, gritty sandy loam about 14inches thick.

[...] The concept {{was similar to that}} used by the Eleventh Farm Credit District except that the subsoil was described as a sandy clay with an abrupt upper and lower boundary. [...] This was the first official description that approached the modern concept of the San Joaquin series. [...] Subsequent field and laboratory studies have led to further revisions and to the present concept given in the 1996 series description.In 1983, the type location for the San Joaquin soil was relocated to a site north of Lodi, California, in San Joaquin county. [...] At that time, a monolith (a preserved 5 foot profile section) of the San Joaquin soil was prepared for this site and sent to the Netherlands World Soil Museum in Wageningen, the Netherlands. [...] Previously, the San Joaquin soil had been selected by the Soil Conservation Service as one of California's Benchmark Soils. [...] "Benchmark Soils" [...] is a nationwide listing of soil series considered representative of soils in Major Land Resource Areas (MLRA) in the United States.Modern <b>soil</b> <b>survey</b> maps now show the distribution of San Joaquin Soil of California in Fresno, Madera, Mariposa, Merced, Placer, Sacramento, San Joaquin, Stanislaus, Sutter, Tulare, and Yuba Counties.

2500|$|The USDA {{shows that}} grassed {{waterways}} {{of less than}} 5% slopes for a chosen waterway will greatly reduce velocity of draining water within the land. The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) offers {{the use of an}} online <b>Soil</b> <b>survey</b> to view the area of land to be planted and examine slope and soil drainage. As viewed by the Natural Resources Conservation Service, soil drainage is the number one priority for location of certain grasses. [...] Poorer drainage causes less infiltration of water into the soil as groundwater recharge causing ponding and flooding of surrounding crops. [...] Higher drainage becomes more droughty which hinders the establishment of certain grasses good for waterways. [...] Medium soil drainage becomes the most suitable for planting. [...] Determining exact grasses and seed amounts to plant follows specifications of a local NRCS Field Office Technical Guide and the Contour Buffer practice standard while taking practice on land and regional environmental conditions into consideration.|$|E

Cecil County, Maryland, and Connecticut Valley, Connecticut, concentrated on tobacco lands.

2500|$|The {{concept of}} the soil did not change {{significantly}} {{from that of the}} original survey in 1900, but sandy loam and clay loam types were recognized. [...] In addition, an increase in clay content of the subsoil above the hardpan was described in some places. [...] Where the hardpan was less than 30inches deep, it was noted that it was necessary to fracture the hardpan by blasting to grow fruit trees. [...] There were about 127,000 acres (514km²) mapped. In the 1915 Reconnaissance <b>Soil</b> <b>Survey</b> of the Sacramento Valley, California by L.C. Holmes, et al., heavier (finer) textures, either clay loams or clays, were described as normally intervening between the surface soil and the hardpan in the San Joaquin soil [...] San Joaquin soils mapped in the Reconnaissance Soil Surveys of the San Joaquin Valley and Southern California in 1915 to 1919 were similarly described. [...] San Joaquin soil identified in Southern California at that time have subsequently been correlated with other similar, but pedologically different soils.|$|E
2500|$|The {{history of}} {{recognition}} {{and the development}} of the San Joaquin soil dates from the turn of the 20th century. [...] Field operations of the United States <b>Soil</b> <b>Survey,</b> now known as the National Cooperative <b>Soil</b> <b>Survey,</b> began in 1899. [...] The San Joaquin soil was initially documented and officially established in 1900 {{as one of the first}} four soil series recognized in California by the survey. [...] All were considered to have agricultural importance. [...] Since then, three of these series have either been dropped from the official listings or have been combined with other soil series recognized at a later date. [...] Thus, the San Joaquin soil is the oldest, continuously recognized soil series within the state. [...] (More than 1,500 soil series are currently recognized in California.) [...] Nearly one-half million acres (2,000km²) of this soil have now been identified and mapped in many counties in California. [...] With proper management, this soil has produced many billions of dollars of food wealth for the state's economy. [...] Knowledge of the San Joaquin soil's properties and characteristics has become increasingly important in suburban and urban development. [...] As the science of soil has advanced during this century, the concept of the San Joaquin soil has evolved, but has retained, as distinctive soil characteristics, its reddish soil color and its strongly cemented subsoil hardpan that limits root and water penetration. [...] Aside from the texture and structure of the surface soil, the early descriptions of the San Joaquin soil paid little attention to the physical character of the subsoil above the hardpan. [...] The hardpan was expected to be encountered within a depth of 6 feet. [...] The modern concept recognizes mainly a sandy loam surface soil overlying a finer textured subsoil that has a significant clay increase, at its upper boundary or within some part of the subsoil. [...] The subsoil rests abruptly on a mainly silica-cemented hardpan at depths ranging from 20 to 40inches. [...] With these features, plus defined ranges of other surface and subsoil properties such as color, soil texture, structure, consistence, pH, organic matter content, and inherent temperature and moisture characteristics, USDA soil taxonomy now places the San Joaquin series in a fine, mixed, thermic family of Abruptic Durixeralfs. [...] The San Joaquin soil was first recognized in the survey of the Fresno Area in 1900.|$|E
2500|$|Because of its {{location}} in the higher elevations of northwestern New Jersey the Papakating Creek's watershed has a cooler humid continental climate or microthermal climate (Köppen climate classification Dfb) which indicates patterns of significant precipitation in all seasons and at least four months where the average temperature rises above [...] This differs {{from the rest of}} the state which is generally a humid mesothermal climate, in which temperatures range [...] between −3°C (27°F) and 18°C (64°F) during the year's coldest month. Sussex County is part of USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 6. According to the USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service <b>soil</b> <b>survey,</b> the area receives sunshine approximately 62% of the time in summer and 48% in winter. [...] Prevailing winds are typically from the southwest for most of year; but in late winter and early spring come from the northwest. The Kittatinny Valley to the north of Newton experiences a snowbelt phenomenon and has been categorized as a microclimate region known as the [...] "Sussex County Snow Belt." [...] This region receives approximately forty to fifty inches of snow per year and generally more snowfall that the rest of Northern New Jersey and the Northern Climate Zone. This phenomenon is attributed to the orographic lift of Kittatinny Mountain which impacts local weather patterns by increasing humidity and precipitation.|$|E

50|$|Early <b>soil</b> <b>surveys</b> {{were made}} to help farmers locate soils {{responsive}} to different management practices {{and to help them}} decide what crops and management practices were most suitable for the particular kinds of soil on their farms.

They conceived soils as mainly the weathering products of geologic formations, defined by landform and lithologic composition. Most of the <b>soil</b> <b>surveys</b> published before 1910 were strongly influenced by these concepts.
