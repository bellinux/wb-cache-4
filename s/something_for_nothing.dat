25|$|Altruism is {{constantly}} referenced by proponents of organ gifting. Authors such as Sahlins (1972), incorporated Maussian concepts of gifting and reciprocity and expanded them to describe three {{different types of}} transactions: generalized reciprocity (system of giving without taking account of how much is given), balanced reciprocity (direct exchange, expectation of equal value), and negative reciprocity (obtaining <b>something</b> <b>for</b> <b>nothing).</b> Individuals engage in {{each one of these}} transaction depending on the person they are exchanging with and the social distance involved. Sahlins' (1972) work has pointed to the need to examine the different types of relationships behind gift-giving and the characteristics of the transaction. In the case of generalized reciprocity, altruistic relationships are present and the expectation of reciprocity is indefinite.|$|E
25|$|The {{change in}} title of Gaskell's fourth novel from Margaret Hale (Ingham, 1995, p xii) to Dickens' {{suggested}} North and South underscores its theme of modernity versus tradition. Until {{the end of}} the 18th century, power in England was {{in the hands of the}} aristocracy and landed gentry based in the south. The Industrial Revolution unsettled the centuries-old class structure, shifting wealth and power to manufacturers who mass-produced goods in the north. Cities such as Manchester, on which Gaskell modelled her fictional Milton, were hastily developed to house workers who moved from the semi-feudal countryside to work in the new factories. The south represents the past (tradition): aristocratic landowners who inherited their property, collected rent from farmers and peasants, and assumed an obligation for their tenants' welfare. The north represents the future (modernity); its leaders were self-made men like Gaskell's hero, John Thornton, who accumulated wealth as working, middle-class entrepreneurs. In their view, philanthropy or charity – giving <b>something</b> <b>for</b> <b>nothing</b> – was a dangerous imbalance of the relationship between employers and employees (which was based on the exchange of cash for labour).|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} plates {{of the war}} grouping, Goya's sympathies appear to lie with the Spanish defenders. These images {{typically}} show patriots facing hulking, anonymous invaders who treat them with fierce cruelty. As the series progresses, {{the distinction between the}} Spanish and the imperialists becomes ambiguous. In other plates, it is difficult to tell to which camp the distorted and disfigured corpses belong. Some of the titles deliberately question the intentions of both sides; for example, Con razon ó sin ella can mean with or without reason, rightly or wrongly, or <b>for</b> <b>something</b> or <b>for</b> <b>nothing.</b> Critic Philip Shaw notes that the ambiguity is still present in the final group of plates, saying there is no distinction between the [...] "heroic defenders of the Fatherland and the barbaric supporters of the old regime". There have been a variety of English translations offered for the plate titles. In many instances, the satirical and often sardonic ambiguity and play on Spanish proverbs found in Goya's carefully worded original titles is lost.|$|R

This led to one or two very intimate private dinners, to my inclusion in one or two house parties and various odd offers of introductions and services that I didn't for the most part accept. Among other people who sought me in this way was Archie Garvell, now a smart, impecunious soldier of no particular distinction, who would, I think, have been quite prepared to develop any sporting instincts I possessed, and who was beautifully unaware of our former contact.

60|$|It was in April 1899 {{that the}} British Uitlanders sent their {{petition}} praying for protection to their native country. Since the April previous a correspondence {{had been going}} on between Dr. Leyds, Secretary of State for the South African Republic, and Mr. Chamberlain, Colonial Secretary, upon the existence or non-existence of the suzerainty.

6000|$|Another of {{the many}} sins justly charged against the [...] "kings of finance" [...] was this: They would buy {{properties}} worth, say, ten millions of [...] "dollars" [...] (the {{value of the dollar}} is now unknown) and issue stock upon it to the face value of, say, fifty millions. This their clamorous critics called [...] "creating" [...] for themselves forty millions of dollars. They created nothing; the stock had no dishonest value unless sold, and even at the most corrupt period of the government nobody was compelled by law to buy. In nine cases in ten the person who bought did so in the hope and expectation of getting much for little and <b>something</b> <b>for</b> <b>nothing.</b> The buyer was no better than the seller. He was a gambler. He [...] "played against the game of the man who kept the table" [...] (as the phrase went), and naturally he lost. Naturally, too, he cried out, but his lamentations, though echoed shrilly by the demagogues, seem to have been unavailing. Even the rudimentary intelligence of that primitive people discerned the impracticability of laws forbidding the seller to set his own price on the thing he would sell and declare it worth that price. Then, as now, nobody had to believe him. Of the few who bought these [...] "watered" [...] stocks in good faith as an investment in the honest hope of dividends it seems sufficient to say, in the words of an ancient Roman, [...] "Against stupidity the gods themselves are powerless." [...] Laws that would adequately protect the foolish from the consequence of their folly would put an end to all commerce. The sin of [...] "over-capitalization" [...] differed in magnitude only, not in kind, from the daily practice of every salesman in every shop.

60|$|And {{while the}} {{emergent}} New Republic is deciding {{to provide for}} the swarming inferiority of the Abyss, and developing the morality and educational system of the future, in this fashion, it will be attacking that mass of irresponsible property that is so unavoidable and so threatening under present conditions. The attack will, of course, be made along lines that the developing science of economics will trace in the days immediately before us. A scheme of death duties and of heavy graduated taxes upon irresponsible incomes, with, perhaps, in addition, a system of terminable liability for borrowers, will probably suffice to control the growth of this creditor elephantiasis. The detailed contrivances are for the specialist to make. If {{there is such a thing}} as bitterness in the public acts of the New Republicans, it will probably be found in the measures that will be directed against those who are parasitic, or who attempt to be parasitic, upon the social body, either by means of gambling, by manipulating the medium of exchange, or by such interventions upon legitimate transactions as, for example, the legal trade union in Great Britain contrives in the case of house property and land. Simply because he fails more often than he succeeds, there is still a disposition among sentimental people to regard the gambler or the speculator as rather a dashing, adventurous sort of person, and to contrast his picturesque gallantry with the sober certainties of honest men. The men of the New Republic will be obtuse to the glamour of such romance; they will regard the gambler simply as a mean creature who hangs about the social body in the hope of getting <b>something</b> <b>for</b> <b>nothing,</b> who runs risks to filch the possessions of other men, exactly as a thief does. They will put the two on a footing, and the generous gambler, like the kindly drunkard, in the face of their effectual provision for his little weakness, will cease to complain that his worst enemy is himself. And, in dealing with speculation, the New Republic will have the power of an assured faith and purpose, and the resources of an economic science that is as yet only in its infancy. In such matters the New Republic will entertain no superstition of laissez faire. Money and credit are as much human contrivances as bicycles, and as liable to expansion and modification as any other sort of prevalent but imperfect machine.|$|E

60|$|So with {{a pistol}} in one hand, and a candle in the other, Miss Harmer went out of her door and along the short {{corridor}} which led to her sister's bedroom--a strange gaunt figure, in a long white dress covering her head--in fact a nun's attire, which she put on when she prayed at night, and from underneath which the stiff white frills of her cap bristled out strangely. She walked deliberately along, for she believed that she was only deceiving herself, and that the cry which she had thought she heard was only a wilder gust of wind among the trees. When she reached her sister's door, she paused and listened. Then she started back, for within she could hear low murmured words in men's voices, and then a strange stifled cry: she hesitated but for one moment, to deliberate whether she {{should go back to}} fetch the other pistol--then that strange cry came up again, and she threw open the door and entered. She was prepared <b>for</b> <b>something,</b> but <b>for</b> <b>nothing</b> so terrible as met her eyes.

But all this Cecilia Harmer did not notice then, her eyes were fixed on the group in the middle of the room.|$|R
60|$|For a {{time it was}} a {{question}} whether he should not go back with his family to their old home in Hartford. Perhaps the father's and mother's hearts drew them there all the more strongly because of the grief written ineffaceably over it, but for the younger ones it was no longer the measure of the world. It was easier for all to stay on indefinitely in New York, which is a sojourn without circumstance, and equally the home of exile and of indecision. The Clemenses took a pleasant, spacious house at Riverdale, on the Hudson, and there I began to see them again on something like the sweet old terms. They lived far more unpretentiously than they used, and I think with a notion of economy, which they had never very successfully practised. I recall {{that at the end of}} a certain year in Hartford, when they had been saving and paying cash for everything, Clemens wrote, reminding me of their avowed experiment, and asking me to guess how many bills they had at New Year's; he hastened to say that a horse-car would not have held them. At Riverdale they kept no carriage, and there was a snowy night when I drove up to their handsome old mansion in the station carryall, which was crusted with mud as from the going down of the Deluge after transporting Noah and his family from the Ark to whatever point they decided to settle at provisionally. But the good talk, the rich talk, the talk that could never suffer poverty of mind or soul, was there, and we jubilantly found ourselves again in our middle youth. It was the mighty moment when Clemens was building his engines of war for the destruction of Christian Science, which superstition nobody, and he least of all, expected to destroy. It would not be easy to say whether in his talk of it his disgust for the illiterate twaddle of Mrs. Eddy's book, or his admiration of her genius for organization was the greater. He believed that as a religious machine the Christian Science Church was as perfect as the Roman Church and destined to be, more formidable in its control of the minds of men. He looked for its spread over the whole of Christendom, and throughout the winter he spent at Riverdale he was ready to meet all listeners more than half-way with his convictions of its powerful grasp of the average human desire to get <b>something</b> <b>for</b> <b>nothing.</b> The vacuous vulgarity of its texts was a perpetual joy to him, while he bowed with serious respect to the sagacity which built so securely upon the everlasting rock of human credulity and folly.|$|E
