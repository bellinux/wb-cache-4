25|$|Because a {{combustible}} fuel/air mixture {{will always}} exist in fuel tanks, Boeing designers {{had attempted to}} eliminate all possible <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>ignition</b> in the 747's tanks. To do so, all devices are protected from vapor intrusion, and voltages and currents used by the Fuel Quantity Indication System (FQIS) are kept very low. In {{the case of the}} 747-100 series, the only wiring located inside the CWT is that which is associated with the FQIS.|$|E
25|$|Like other hydrocarbons, {{gasoline}} {{burns in}} a limited range of its vapor phase and, coupled with its volatility, this makes leaks highly dangerous when <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>ignition</b> are present. Gasoline has a lower explosive limit of 1.4% by volume and an upper explosive limit of 7.6%. If the concentration is below 1.4%, the air-gasoline mixture is too lean and does not ignite. If the concentration is above 7.6%, the mixture is too rich and also does not ignite. However, gasoline vapor rapidly mixes and spreads with air, making unconstrained gasoline quickly flammable.|$|E
25|$|Methane gas has an LEL of 5.0%. If the {{atmosphere}} {{has less than}} 5.0% methane, an explosion cannot occur even if a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>ignition</b> is present.|$|R

50|$|Mike Green, {{a retired}} {{professor}} of pathology, related one similar case in his career, {{but would not}} himself use the term spontaneous combustion. He believed {{there had to be}} some <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>ignition,</b> a cigarette or ember from a fire. The <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the <b>ignition</b> is subsequently lost as the body burns. Green surmised that the circumstances surrounding the death of Michael Faherty were very similar to other possible cases. Green also dismissed any explanations centred on divine intervention.|$|R
2500|$|Fire {{prevention}} {{is intended to}} reduce <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>ignition.</b> [...] Fire prevention also includes education to teach people how to avoid causing fires.

Purposely starting destructive fires constitutes arson and is a crime in most jurisdictions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cause of}} fire {{can be readily}} seen when one {{considers}} that {{in the midst of this}} pile of oil-soaked wood was placed the biggest furnace that could be afforded by the owner, capped with an enormous smokestack to generate the maximum amount of draft for the fire. [...] Added to this was the risk, in the days before electric light, associated with oil and kerosene lanterns and other <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>ignition.</b> [...] Many vessels were destroyed by fire, two examples being Mizpah and Urania.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>ignition,</b> and a naked flame {{need not be}} the only one: over one half of the dust explosions in Germany in 2005 were from non-flame sources. Common <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>ignition</b> include: ...|$|E
25|$|In {{an attempt}} to {{determine}} what ignited the flammable fuel-air vapor in the CWT and caused the explosion, the NTSB evaluated numerous potential ignition sources. All but one were considered very unlikely {{to have been the}} <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>ignition.</b>|$|R
50|$|Pyrite enjoyed brief {{popularity}} in the 16th and 17th centuries as a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>ignition</b> in early firearms, most notably the wheellock, where the cock held a lump of pyrite against a circular file to strike the sparks needed to fire the gun.|$|R
50|$|Regardless <b>of</b> the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>ignition</b> or {{the initial}} {{fuel for the}} fire, there remains the {{question}} of what caused the rapid spread of flames {{along the length of the}} airship.

25|$|By August 1940, the War Office {{produced}} training {{instructions for}} the creation and use of Molotov cocktails. The instructions suggested scoring the bottles vertically with a diamond to ensure breakage and providing fuel-soaked rag, windproof matches or a length of cinema film (made of highly flammable nitrocellulose) as a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>ignition.</b>|$|R
25|$|A Molotov {{cocktail}} is a {{breakable glass}} bottle containing a flammable substance such as gasoline, alcohol or a napalm-like mixture, with some motor oil added, and usually a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>ignition</b> {{such as a}} burning cloth wick {{held in place by}} the bottle's stopper.

50|$|Forensic {{investigations}} {{have attempted to}} analyze reported instances of SHC and have resulted in hypotheses regarding potential causes and mechanisms, including victim behavior and habits, alcohol consumption and proximity to potential <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>ignition,</b> {{as well as the}} behavior of fires that consume melted fats. Natural explanations, as well as unverified natural phenomena, have been proposed to explain reports of SHC.

50|$|However, it {{is often}} {{difficult}} to determine the exact <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>ignition</b> when investigating after an explosion. When a source cannot be found, ignition will often be attributed to static electricity. Static charges can be generated by external sources, or can be internally generated by friction at the surfaces of particles themselves as they collide or move past one another.|$|R
40|$|Since 1997 {{numerous}} fires {{have been}} reported to the Food and Drug Administration involving cylinder valves installed on medical use oxygen cylinders sold and operated within the United States.

50|$|The {{autoignition}} temperature or kindling {{point of a}} substance is the lowest temperature at which it spontaneously ignites in normal atmosphere without an external <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>ignition,</b> such as a flame or spark. This temperature is required to supply the activation energy needed for combustion. The temperature at which a chemical ignites decreases as the pressure or oxygen concentration increases. It is usually applied to a combustible fuel mixture.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of a firebox explosion, these {{typically}} occur after a burner flameout. Oil fumes, natural gas, propane, coal, or any other fuel can build up inside the combustion chamber. This is especially of concern when the vessel is hot; the fuels will rapidly volatize due to the temperature. Once the lower explosive limit (LEL) is reached, any <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>ignition</b> will cause an explosion of the vapors.|$|R
50|$|Remove all <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>ignition.</b> Ventilate area of leak or spill. Wear {{appropriate}} personal protective {{equipment as}} specified in Section 8. Spills: Clean up spills {{in a manner that}} does not disperse dust into the air. Use non-sparking tools and equipment. Reduce airborne dust and prevent scattering by moistening with water. Pick up spill for recovery or disposal and place in a closed container.|$|E

50|$|If IBA {{is used as}} the {{aggregate}} in foam concrete in non-ventilated areas, hydrogen gas deposits may build up during the lifespan of the material and explode when brought into contact with <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> <b>ignition,</b> such as during cutting with grinding equipment. Suspicion of this has resulted in its use being banned by at least two firms in the US and brought about further investigation by the Health and Safety Executive.|$|E
5000|$|Early primer {{was simply}} fine {{gunpowder}} poured into a pan or tube {{where it could}} be ignited by some external <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>ignition</b> such as a fuse or a spark. Modern primers are shock sensitive chemicals enclosed in a small (a few mm) capsule, ignited by percussion. In some instance ignition is electricity-primed, and there may even be no primer at all in such design (the propellant being directly ignited).|$|R
5|$|The {{extent of}} the damage meant it was not {{possible}} to determine the exact <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>ignition,</b> but possibilities include an emergency generator and the depot's fire pump system. The investigators did not believe that it was caused either by the driver of a fuel tanker, as had been speculated, or by anyone using a mobile phone. It was felt unlikely that the explosion had a widespread effect on air quality at ground level.|$|R
50|$|Fire breather’s {{pneumonia}} {{is caused}} by the entrance of hydrocarbon fuels into the bronchial tree, usually due to accidental aspiration or inhalation during a fire performance show. Fire breathing, or fire blowing, is the act of creating a plume of fire by blowing a mouthful of fuel in a fine mist (atomization) over a <b>source</b> <b>of</b> <b>ignition.</b> Fire eating, or fire swallowing, is the act of putting a flaming object into the mouth and extinguishing it.|$|R
