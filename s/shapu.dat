40|$|Seasonal hyperacute panuveitis (<b>SHAPU)</b> is a {{potentially}} blinding ocular disease occurring in Nepal that principally affects young children. Random amplification of partially purified vitreous fluid (VF) –derived nucleic acid revealed {{the presence of}} human anelloviruses in VF of <b>SHAPU</b> patients. In a comparative study of patients with different ocular pathologies, <b>SHAPU</b> patients were at highest risk of harboring anelloviruses in their eyes. The majority of <b>SHAPU</b> patients had multiple anelloviruses in their VF. The ocular anellovirus load in <b>SHAPU</b> and non-SHAPU patients did not differ and no SHAPU-specific anellovirus variant was detected. Analysis of paired serum and VF samples from <b>SHAPU</b> and non-SHAPU patients showed that the anellovirus detected in VF samples most likely originated from the systemic viral pool during viremia, poten-tially through breakdown of the blood-ocular barrier. The detection of anelloviruses in VF samples of uveitis patients, profoundly so in <b>SHAPU</b> patients, is imperative and warrants elucidation of its clinical significance. Seasonal hyperacute panuveitis (<b>SHAPU)</b> is a sight-threatening ocular disease characterized as an acute diffuse fulminant ocular inflammation [1 – 5]. The disease was first diagnosed in Nepal about 35 {{years ago and has}} only been reported in Nepal. <b>SHAPU</b> prefer...|$|E
