25|$|After {{completing}} his primary {{education at the}} local school, Froim spent {{the remainder of his}} childhood years in the southwestern city of Craiova and in rural Oltenia. Avram set up a new business in partnership with the <b>State</b> <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Monopoly,</b> while Froim attended the Carol I High School. He was soon expelled from all state-funded lyceums, after his school-paper on the historical Jesus was deemed anti-Christian. Turning to literature, Froim pondered rallying with the traditionalist writers, who later became his ideological adversaries. The poems he sent to Sămănătorul magazine were sent back to him, but other pieces saw print in Sămănătoruls provincial satellite, Ramuri.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the peak}} of global tobacco production, 20 million rural Chinese {{households}} were producing tobacco on 2.1 million hectares of land. While it is the major crop for millions of Chinese farmers, growing tobacco is not as profitable as cotton or sugarcane, because the Chinese government sets the market price. While this price is guaranteed, it {{is lower than the}} natural market price, {{because of the lack of}} market risk. To further control tobacco in their borders, China founded a <b>State</b> <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Monopoly</b> Administration (STMA) in 1982. The STMA controls tobacco production, marketing, imports, and exports, and contributes 12% to the nation's national income. As noted above, despite the income generated for the state by profits from state-owned tobacco companies and the taxes paid by companies and retailers, China's government has acted to reduce tobacco use.|$|E
25|$|Unable to {{contract}} more foreign loans, Carp opened the country's oil industry and forestry to foreign investments, and introduced budget cuts in local administration. As a leading measure, the Premier attempted to relinquish the state's {{share in the}} National Bank of Romania (BNR). The project was opposed by BNR founder and National Liberal doyen Eugeniu Carada, who informed Carp {{that there was little}} chance of profitable privatization. BNR Governor Mihail C. Sutzu also resisted the move—the other shareholders ultimately agreed to purchase government stock, and to provide future loans for the state. As an alternative measure, Carp leased the <b>state</b> <b>tobacco</b> <b>monopoly</b> to a bankers' syndicate. In Education, Minister Constantin C. Arion imposed a norm against the accumulation of offices in the academic system, a measure largely directed at PNL-ist staff. Through his Minister of Internal Affairs (Constantin Olănescu), Carp also imposed strict measures against moonshiners, after which riots and bloodshed occurred throughout the poorer regions of Wallachia.|$|E
