5|$|As {{the issue}} of his college {{eligibility}} was playing out, Gambino was being courted by several professional football teams. The Chicago Bears of the NFL, which had drafted him during the war, still had a <b>strong</b> <b>interest</b> in him, as did the Baltimore Colts of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC). Baltimore eventually acquired Gambino, and to do so, they traded their first-round 1948 draft selection to the Cleveland Browns, who held Gambino's AAFC draft rights.|$|E

40|$|According to the Exchange Hypothesis, the Family Hypothesis and the Status Maximization Hypothesis, men {{and women}} and {{upwardly}} and downwardly mobile people differ with respect to their preference for certain status characteristics of a marriage partner. Using four editions of the Family Survey of the Dutch Population, we analyze 2130 married couples and investigate the difference between these groups. The results do not show a difference in preferences between {{men and women}}. Both have the <b>strongest</b> <b>interest</b> in a marriage partner with a large quantity of achieved socioeconomic resources and the weakest interest in a marriage partner with similar cultural resources. Compared to downwardly mobile people, upwardly mobile people have a <b>stronger</b> <b>interest</b> in a marriage partner with many ascribed socioeconomic resources and with similar cultural resources. Compared to upwardly mobile people, downwardly mobile people have a <b>stronger</b> <b>interest</b> in a marriage partner with many achieved socioeconomic resources...|$|R
5|$|Eisenhower {{would leave}} office with an {{agreement}} out of reach, as Eisenhower's technical advisors, upon whom he relied heavily, became {{mired in the}} complex technical questions of a test ban, driven {{in part by a}} <b>strong</b> <b>interest</b> among American experts to lower the error rate of seismic test detection technology. Some, including Kistiakowsky, would eventually raise concerns about the ability of inspections and monitors to successfully detect tests. The primary product of negotiations under Eisenhower was the testing moratorium without any enforcement mechanism. Ultimately, the goal of a comprehensive test ban would be abandoned in favor of a partial ban due to questions over seismic detection of underground tests.|$|E
5|$|Less {{expensive}} cloth paintings (tüchlein) {{were more}} common in middle-class households, and records show a <b>strong</b> <b>interest</b> in domestically owned religious panel paintings. Members of the merchant class typically commissioned smaller devotional panels, containing specified subject matter.

Under his direction, the UERL's Underground network and associated bus services expanded considerably reaching out into new areas and stimulating the growth of London's suburbs. His impact on the growth of London between the world wars led to him being likened to Baron Haussmann and Robert Moses.|$|E

Schumacher and Goldsman conceived the storyline during pre-production on A Time to Kill, while Val Kilmer decided not to reprise the role over scheduling conflicts with The Saint. Schumacher had a <b>strong</b> <b>interest</b> in casting William Baldwin in Kilmer's place before George Clooney won the role. Principal photography began in September 1996 and finished in January 1997, two weeks ahead of the shooting schedule.|$|E
5|$|During Muñoz Rivera's childhood, Barranquitas was a {{small rural}} town. The family's house was {{moderately}} large for the time; it was built with wood and its roof was made with zinc. When he was four, his mother home-schooled him with books from a private library owned by his father. By the age of ten, Muñoz Rivera completed the education offered in the town's school, and finished first in his class. He was educated in Spanish and French, and took music classes with Jorge Colombani. His father hired private tutors to continue his instruction. Muñoz Rivera was a serious student with a <b>strong</b> <b>interest</b> in Miguel de Cervantes' works, in particular Don Quixote.

5|$|During the club's victory parade, {{with only}} one year left on his {{contract}} Chamakh declared {{that he would be}} staying at Bordeaux for the 2009–10 season, despite <b>strong</b> <b>interest</b> from Premier League club Arsenal. Despite the statement, rumors of a move to Arsenal continued to surface with negotiations reportedly having been ongoing throughout the summer. On 3 August 2009, president Jean-Louis Triaud declared that Arsenal had sent a bid of €7million for Chamakh and that he had rejected it, demanding that Arsenal improve its offer. The following day, Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger announced {{that he would not be}} offering a better deal and declared the possible transfer dead. The announcement subsequently led Chamakh to confirm his intent to remain at Bordeaux for the 2009–10 season. On 29 August, Chamakh reportedly snubbed a move to West Ham United. The club offered Bordeaux £18million for the player and offered Chamakh a four-year contract worth £3million a year. However, Chamakh remained firm on his stance, reiterating his commitment to Bordeaux.|$|E
5|$|H.D. {{was born}} into the Moravian {{community}} in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Her father, Charles Doolittle, was professor of astronomy at Lehigh University and her mother, Helen (Wolle), was a Moravian with a <b>strong</b> <b>interest</b> in music.

In 1905, Pound presented her with a sheaf of love poems under the collective title Hilda's Book.|$|E
5|$|One of Edward's {{persistent}} challenges {{through most}} of his reign was a shortage of money; of the debts he inherited from his father, around £60,000 was still owing in the 1320s. The King {{worked his way through}} many treasurers and other financial officials, few of whom stayed long, raising revenues through often unpopular taxes, and requisitioning goods using his right of prise. He also took out many loans, first through the Frescobaldi family, and then through his banker Antonio Pessagno. Edward took a <b>strong</b> <b>interest</b> in financial matters towards the end of his reign, distrusting his own officials and attempting to increase revenues directly by cutting back on the expenses of his own household.|$|E

5|$|The law was {{a second}} attempt by Senator Yee to enact {{restrictions}} for video game sales to minors. Yee's background as a child psychologist led him to assert there was a connection between video games and violence and believed {{that the government had}} <b>strong</b> <b>interest</b> in restricting video game sales to minors as was already done for pornographic works. In 2004, Yee had drafted a law that would have required mature-rated video games to be stocked separately from other titles. Though the bill ultimately passed as CA Law AB 1793, the bill's language was diluted at its passage, only requiring stores to display the ESRB ratings system and provide information to parents about it.|$|E
5|$|Varian {{was one of}} a {{very few}} experts in the 21st century who was still {{teaching}} about vaquero equipment, methods, and history. She had a <b>strong</b> <b>interest</b> {{in the history of the}} spade bit horse in California. The spade is an elaborate, complex bit that can only be properly used on a highly trained horse handled by a skilled rider. In the vaquero tradition, its use represents the highest level of trust and communication between horse and rider. The process of training the spade bit horse takes five to seven years to complete. Its emphasis has always been on producing a finely tuned working horse and partner, emphasizing quality rather than on how quickly the goal is reached. The conformation of the horse is also a factor; to become a spade bit horse, the animal must be bred to have a higher neck set and well-carried head. Varian compared the ride and handling of a horse trained in this manner to that of a Jaguar automobile.|$|E
5|$|After graduating, Dawkins did a post {{graduate}} {{year at the}} New Hampton School in New Hampton, New Hampshire where he averaged 12.3 points and 3.6 rebounds before receiving a late scholarship offer from Michigan. His grades were not sufficient to pursue a scholarship at Stanford and despite his relationship with Chris Collins, Northwestern {{was not interested in}} Dawkins given their commitments from wings Vic Law and Scottie Lindsey. While at New Hampton, he was being recruited by Steve Donahue of Boston College, but Donahue left Boston College in 2014 and recommended Dawkins to Beilein. Before Michigan stepped in, it appeared that he would have committed to Dayton, although he was also considering Utah State, Pepperdine as well as Montana, and Rhode Island was showing a <b>strong</b> <b>interest.</b> In fact, during the 2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, Dawkins attended the Sweet 16 round to watch his father's Stanford Cardinal play Dayton in the South Regional on March 27. Dawkins accepted a recruiting visit to Michigan in early April 2014 when he received his scholarship offer. He made his verbal commitment on April 28 and signed his National Letter of Intent on May 9.|$|E
