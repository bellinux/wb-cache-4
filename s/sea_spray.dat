5|$|September 5, 1874 – A {{hurricane}} to {{the west}} generates huge swells as <b>sea</b> <b>spray</b> defoliates plants across the territory.|$|E
5|$|Making for the harbour mouth, the British ship's bow {{and stern}} {{alternately}} rose and plunged into the incoming waves; the propeller at times was spinning in air, requiring a careful hand on the throttle to keep the shaft from running away to destruction. Green seas were boarding the vessel and running {{the length of the}} deck. There were ten men on the wheel and more below handling relieving tackle on the tiller to assist in maintaining control of the rudder. Taking two hours to travel four cables, the cruiser finally escaped the anchorage into the open sea, an achievement not known to Calliopes crew for some time, as <b>sea</b> <b>spray</b> and spume had reduced visibility to nothing.|$|E
5|$|During the summer, {{a mass of}} hot and wet air, {{brought by}} the south and western {{maritime}} winds, creates Póvoa de Varzim's characteristic fog covering only the coast and with strong ocean scent brought in by the marine layer, which is composed of salt from surf and <b>sea</b> <b>spray,</b> with lesser amounts of iodine from the outlying kelp forests. Sunshine duration values are high, between April and September the mean is always over 217 hours, peaking in July with 308 hours. The gloomiest months are December and January with 124 hours each (1961–1990 data). Solar irradiance is high in the city's beaches, and lower inland and in the northwestern coast. The prevailing northern winds, known as Nortadas, arise in the summer after midday. Strongest wind gusts are felt in the city's sands and only reaching inland in municipalities south of Póvoa de Varzim.|$|E
30|$|Halite {{could also}} be derived from wind-blown <b>sea</b> <b>sprays.</b> Given that Tikal is located far from the coast. This origin seems unlikely. It is {{therefore}} more possible that soluble salts containing halite and sulphate salts {{may be at the}} origin of deposited material.|$|R

50|$|The cuticles {{of plants}} {{function}} as permeability barriers {{for water and}} water-soluble materials. The cuticle both prevents plant surfaces from becoming wet and helps to prevent plants from drying out. Xerophytic plants such as cactus have very thick cuticles to help them survive in their arid climates. Plants that live in range of <b>sea's</b> <b>spray</b> also may have thicker cuticles that {{protect them from the}} toxic effects of salt.|$|R
5|$|These winds {{resulted}} in widespread agricultural, environmental and structural damage. Hundreds of structures sustained severe damage, mostly consisting of roofs blowing off. The most severe losses {{took place in}} Albany where most homes had partial or complete roof failure. Air-borne debris also damaged buildings during the storm. Nearly 80% of the apple crop {{was lost in the}} Donnybrook-Manjimup area. A total of 154,400m3 (5.4million ft3) of timber was lost as well as a potential 200,000m3 (7million ft3) of future growth on established trees. Widespread dust storms also ruined crops and removed topsoil from many areas. Near the coast, the combined effects of strong, onshore winds and little rain led to significant inland <b>sea</b> <b>spray.</b> Numerous power lines and stations failed during the storm due to winds as well as dust and salt accretion. Large portions of the South-West Land Division were without electricity due to Cyclone Alby; Perth nearly sustained a complete breakdown of power services. This led to secondary losses attributable to the storm such as production failure.|$|E
5|$|In November 1973, as {{a result}} of the planned closure of the Victor SR.2 {{equipped}} No. 543 Squadron, No. 27 Squadron reformed at RAF Scampton equipped with the Vulcan as a replacement in the maritime radar reconnaissance role. The squadron carried out patrols of the seas around the British Isles, including the strategically important GIUK gap between Iceland and the United Kingdom, flying at high level and using the Vulcan's H2S radar to monitor shipping. In peacetime, this could be followed up by visual identification and photography of targets of interest at low level. In wartime, a Vulcan would leave visual identification of potential targets to Buccaneers or Canberras, and could coordinate attacks by Buccaneers against hostile shipping. Though initially equipped with a number of B.2 aircraft, the Squadron eventually operated nine B.2 (MRR) aircraft (also known by the unofficial designation SR.2). The aircraft were modified for the role by removing the Terrain Following Radar (and its thimble radome) and adding the LORAN C radio navigation aid. The main external visual difference was the presence of a gloss paint finish, with a light grey undersurface, to protect against <b>sea</b> <b>spray.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most of Yap State was {{affected}} by the typhoon, and the eye of Typhoon Lupit passed near the small atoll of Ulithi. The typhoon also passed near Fais, producing estimated gusts of over 185km/h (115mph). On both islands, Lupit produced waves of , causing severe beach erosion, and <b>sea</b> <b>spray</b> and flooding contaminated water supplies. In Fais, there was little flooding {{because it is an}} elevated island, although several buildings were damaged, mostly to roofs. On Ulithi, areas along the coast were flooded up to 1.5m (5ft) deep. Crops were wrecked on both islands, and on Ulithi, it was estimated that the soil would be unfit for growing for at least a year. Stations on Ulithi reported wind gusts of 158km/h (98mph), and 263mm (10.35in) of rainfall. Lupit affected other islands in Yap State with coastal flooding of around 1m (3ft), severe beach erosion, and wrecked crops. Several islands' water supply were contaminated. On Woleai, the storm downed trees and power lines, and the runway was closed for a week after being covered with water. Damage in Yap State was least on Yap, where winds gusted to 93km/h (58mph) and rainfall totaled 128mm (5.02in) in a 24‑hour period. There, Lupit downed trees and damaged crops, while high seas flooded areas. There was moderate beach erosion, and some seawalls and coastal roads were damaged.|$|E

5|$|Mireille was {{the strongest}} typhoon to hit Japan since Typhoon Nancy in 1961, causing heavy damage in 41 of 47 prefectures. It was the third storm to strike Japan in two weeks. Damage was {{heaviest}} on Kyushu where the storm made landfall. Because the storm moved northeastward through the Sea of Japan, the eastern quadrant of the storm crossed {{over much of the}} country, which is where the strongest winds in tropical cyclones are located. The high winds downed trees, damaged roofs, and left record power outages, affecting 7.36million people, or about 13% of total customers. In some areas, the power outages lasted as little as three minutes. The storm damaged over 670,000houses, of which 1,058were destroyed, and another 22,965were flooded. Power outages caused at least five factories to shut down production. Along the coast, the typhoon damaged 930ships, with dozens sunk or blown ashore. Most of the damage was related to agriculture or forests. <b>Sea</b> <b>spray</b> heavily damaged fruit trees and rice paddies. Crop damage amounted to $3billion, mostly to the apple industry, after 345,000tons of apples fell to the ground and another 43,000 were damaged on the trees. Most farms lost 80% of their crop, potentially taking 10years to regrow. Persistent cloudiness and rainfall following the storm diminished sunlight by 50%, furthering crop damage. There were 62deaths in Japan and 2,862injuries, including the deaths on the South Korean freighter, making it the deadliest typhoon there in 10years. About 80% of the deaths were male, and 70% were over 60years old. Most of the deaths were related to wind-blown debris, falling due to the wind, or being trapped or struck by fallen objects. The $6billion in insured losses and $10billion in overall damage made Mireille the costliest typhoon on record as of May 2014, according to Munich Re.|$|E

25|$|Wind-blown mineral dust {{tends to}} be made of mineral oxides and other {{material}} blown from the Earth's crust; this particulate is light-absorbing. Sea salt is considered the second-largest contributor in the global aerosol budget, and consists mainly of sodium chloride originated from sea spray; other constituents of atmospheric sea salt reflect the composition of sea water, and thus include magnesium, sulfate, calcium, potassium, etc. In addition, <b>sea</b> <b>spray</b> aerosols may contain organic compounds, which influence their chemistry.|$|E
40|$|Sulphur-containing {{compounds}} are emitted {{naturally to}} the Earth's atmosphere from oceans, soils and plants, {{and as a}} result of weathering of continental crusts, eruptions from volcanoes and <b>sea</b> <b>sprays.</b> However, since the onset of the industrial revolution, human influences (e. g. the combustion of fossil fuels, industrial processes, biomass burning, agricultural activities, waste incineration and the use of explosives) have continuously added more sulphur to the atmosphere, thereby perturbing its natural cycle. Atmospheric sulphur compounds are major contributors to acidic deposition. They affect the Earth-troposphere radiation budget and thus the climate. Sulphur emissions reaching the stratosphere also endanger the ozone layer. In this review, available data concerning the atmospheric concentrations, sources, sinks and environmental impacts of sulphur compounds are discussed. ...|$|R

25|$|Some {{particulates}} occur naturally, {{originating from}} volcanoes, dust storms, forest and grassland fires, living vegetation, and <b>sea</b> <b>spray.</b> Human activities, {{such as the}} {{burning of fossil fuels}} in vehicles, power plants and various industrial processes, also generate significant amounts of particulates. Coal combustion in developing countries is the primary method for heating homes and supplying energy. Because salt spray over the oceans is the overwhelmingly most common form of particulate in the atmosphere, anthropogenic aerosols—those made by human activities—currently account for about 10 percent of the total mass of aerosols in our atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|Particulates, {{alternatively}} {{referred to}} as particulate matter (PM), atmospheric particulate matter, or fine particles, are tiny particles of solid or liquid suspended in a gas. In contrast, aerosol refers to combined particles and gas. Some particulates occur naturally, originating from volcanoes, dust storms, forest and grassland fires, living vegetation, and <b>sea</b> <b>spray.</b> Human activities, such as the {{burning of fossil fuels}} in vehicles, power plants and various industrial processes also generate significant amounts of aerosols. Averaged worldwide, anthropogenic aerosols—those made by human activities—currently account for approximately 10 percent of our atmosphere. Increased levels of fine particles in the air are linked to health hazards such as heart disease, altered lung function and lung cancer.|$|E

25|$|Most Nepenthes species grow in {{environments that}} provide high {{humidity}} and precipitation and moderate to high light levels. A few species, including N.ampullaria, prefer the dense, shaded forests, but most other species thrive {{on the margins}} of tree/shrub communities or clearings. Some species (e.g. N.mirabilis) have been found growing in clear-cut forest areas, roadsides, and disturbed fields. Other species have adapted to growing in savanna-like grass communities. The soils in which Nepenthes species grow are usually acidic and low in nutrients, being composed of peat, white sand, sandstone, or volcanic soils. Exceptions to these generalities include species that thrive in soils with high heavy metal content (e.g. N.rajah), on sandy beaches in the <b>sea</b> <b>spray</b> zone (e.g. N.albomarginata). Other species grow on inselbergs and as lithophytes, while others, such as N.inermis, can grow as epiphytes with no soil contact.|$|E
25|$|Various {{avionics}} and onboard {{systems are}} integrated on the Lynx {{in order to}} perform differing mission profiles. Several operators have equipped their Lynx with BAE Systems' <b>Sea</b> <b>Spray</b> surveillance radar to provide for a surface search capability, which is used in maritime patrol, search and rescue, and other mission profiles. British Army models are equipped with a Marconi Elliot automatic flight control system capable of performing automatic three axes stabilisation. The integration of both avionics and weapons systems is customized upon each Lynx batch to customer specifications and requirements. Most of the installed sensors and avionics are typically integrated with the aircraft's avionics management system (AMS), from {{where they can be}} managed by either pilot; sensors such the optional nose-mounted FLIR can be set up to directly cue the weapon systems. Functions such as navigation and communications are also tied into the AMS, information from these systems are displayed directly to the pilots on interchangeable integrated display units in the cockpit. The Lynx is considerably easier to service and maintain than the AgustaWestland Apache.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis study aims at {{establishing}} groundwater residence times, identifying mineralization {{processes and}} determining groundwater origins within a carbonate coastal aquifer with thick unsaturated zone and {{lying on a}} granitic depression. A multi-tracer approach (major ions, SiO 2, Br-, Ba+, Sr 2 +, 18 O, 2 H, 13 C, 3 H, Ne, Ar) combined with a groundwater residence time determination using CFCs and SF 6 allows defining the global setting of the study site. A typical mineralization conditioned by the <b>sea</b> <b>sprays</b> and the carbonate matrix helped to validate the groundwater weighted residence times from using a binary mixing model. Terrigenic SF 6 excesses have been detected and quantified, which permits to identify a groundwater flow from the surrounding fractured granites towards the lower aquifer principally. The use of CFCs and SF 6 as a first hydrogeological investigation tool is possible and very relevant despite the thick unsaturated zone and the hydraulic connexion with a granitic environment...|$|R

25|$|A {{series of}} {{sandstone}} rockshelfs and rock pools fringe the entire coastline and Port Hacking Estuary Line of the National Park broken on by small sandy beaches and gentle freshwater inlets. Some {{of the most}} commonly encountered molluscs in this habitat include black nerites (Nerita atramentosa), turbin snails (Turbo undulata), zebra snails (Austrocochlea porcata) as well as the commercially farmed Sydney rock oyster (Saccostrea glomerata). One of the most common and distinctive seaweed species that grow among the rock pools and the nearshore rockshelfs is Neptunes necklace (Hormosira banksii) a seaweed made of small buoyant fleshy bead-like structures which resemble strongly that of a necklace. Beds of the primitive sea-squirt cunjevoi (Pyura stolonifera) are common along coastal rockshelfs which are covered by high tide and near <b>sea</b> <b>spray.</b> Considered the most beautiful and obvious of the Royal National Parks' sea anemone is the waratah anemone (Actinia tenebrosa) named after the waratah flower due to its corresponding flame red coloration. A common sea-star found growing in the rock pools is the biscuit sea star (Tosia australis).|$|E
25|$|Among {{the most}} obvious {{patterns}} that the size distribution time series shows {{is that in the}} planet’s most southerly latitudes, nearly all the aerosols are large, but in the high northern latitudes, smaller aerosols are very abundant. Most of the Southern Hemisphere is covered by ocean, where the largest source of aerosols is natural sea salt from dried <b>sea</b> <b>spray.</b> Because land is concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere, the amount of small aerosols from fires and human activities is greater there than in the Southern Hemisphere. Over land, patches of large-radius aerosols appear over deserts and arid regions, most prominently, the Sahara Desert in north Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, where dust storms are common. Places where human-triggered or natural fire activity is common (land-clearing fires in the Amazon from August–October, for example, or lightning-triggered fires in the forests of northern Canada in Northern Hemisphere summer) are dominated by smaller aerosols. Human-produced (fossil fuel) pollution is largely responsible for the areas of small aerosols over developed areas such as the eastern United States and Europe, especially in their summer.|$|E

40|$|Coarse {{particles}} of aerodynamic diameter between 2. 5 and 10 mm (PMc) {{are produced by}} a range of natural (windblown dust and <b>sea</b> <b>sprays)</b> and anthropogenic processes (non-exhaust vehicle emissions, industrial, agriculture, construction and quarrying activities). Although current ambient air quality regulations focus on PM 2. 5 and PM 10, coarse particles are of interest from a public health point of view {{as they have been}} associated with certain mortality and morbidity outcomes. In this paper, an analysis of coarse particle levels in three European capitals (London, Madrid and Athens) is presented and discussed. For all three cities we analysed data from both traffic and urban background monitoring sites. The results showed that the levels of coarse particles present significant seasonal, weekly and daily variability. Their wind driven and non-wind driven resuspension as well as their roadside increment due to traffic were estimated. Both the local meteorological conditions and the air mass history indicating long-range atmospheric transport of {{particles of}} natural origin are significant parameters that influence the levels of coarse particles in the three cities especially during episodic events...|$|R
