MBDA hopes that firings conducted in the U.S., intended for the U.K. to test the feasibility of arming British General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper UAVs with the missile, will persuade the U.S. military to purchase the Brimstone 2.

The United States Army also considered the Brimstone as [...] "an option" [...] in its Joint Air-to-Ground Missile (JAGM) program, but selected Lockheed Martin's dual-mode seeker upgrade for the Hellfire missile.

5000|$|Derrida admires the {{reflexivity}} {{and abstract}} analyses of structuralism, but argues that these discourses have still not gone far enough in treating structures as free-floating (or 'playing') sets of relationships.

Whether this center is [...] "God", [...] "being", [...] "presence", or [...] "man" [...] (as {{it was at the}} colloquium), its function is the same, and the history of structures is a history of substitutions, one center after another, for this constant position.

Whilst, there has been considerable interest in interrelationships between academic disciplines, interrelationships between management fields of study referred to here as subfields are rarely discussed.

More specifically, the Turing account conflates concepts that are crucial for understanding the computational capacities of physical machines. These concepts include the idea of an “operation” or “action” that is “formal,” “mechanical,” “well-defined,” and “precisely described,” and the idea of a “symbol” that is “formal,” “uninterpreted,” and “shaped”. When these concepts are disentangled, the intuitive appeal of Turing's account is significantly undermined. This opens the way for exploring models of hypercomputability that are fundamentally different from those currently entertained in the literature...|$|R
