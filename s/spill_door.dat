5|$|Engine failure causes {{problems}} on conventional subsonic aircraft; {{not only does}} the aircraft lose thrust on that side but the engine creates drag, causing the aircraft to yaw and bank {{in the direction of the}} failed engine. If this had happened to Concorde at supersonic speeds, it theoretically could have caused a catastrophic failure of the airframe. Although computer simulations predicted considerable problems, in practice Concorde could shut down both engines on the same side of the aircraft at Mach 2 without the predicted difficulties. During an engine failure the required air intake is virtually zero. So, on Concorde, engine failure was countered by the opening of the auxiliary <b>spill</b> <b>door</b> and the full extension of the ramps, which deflected the air downwards past the engine, gaining lift and minimising drag. Concorde pilots were routinely trained to handle double engine failure.|$|E
50|$|To help {{cure the}} {{problems}} the starboard wing incidence was increased by 1° 30', and the twin mainwheels {{were replaced by}} single wheel units. <b>Spill</b> <b>doors</b> were fitted to the rear fuselage, arranged to open automatically when the rear engine was throttled back. The flaps and wings were stiffened, and separate aileron hydraulic actuators were installed in the wings rather than a single actuator behind the cockpit seats. Cooling air was provided for the radio which was located close to the front engine jetpipe. To address the failings of the radar, {{it was decided to}} replace it with the Korshun -(Kite) radar also developed by NII-17. The single antenna was moved to the top lip of a redesigned air intake.|$|R

A small shop with a large, paper sign which reads "Howards Souvenir Store will occupy this place on or about Mar. 12 th" stands at center. Bricks and wood paneling have fallen into a pile in front of its <b>door,</b> <b>spilling</b> into the sidewalk. The glass of the show windows is broken and the displays are jumbled. The abutting wall of a brick building {{can be seen on}} the right with the words "Real Estate" printed near its high roof...|$|R
5|$|In New York City, a {{man with}} a camera follows a woman from an {{elevator}} through a corridor to another elevator, where all the people appear to be gray. He gets off on a floor before the woman and runs down the stairs. Lights flicker and the elevator cable snaps. As the man reaches the basement, the cab crashes and its <b>door</b> <b>spills</b> open to reveal the woman's wrist, covered with blood. The man begins to snap photos. Later, in Washington, D.C., FBI Assistant Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.) assigns Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), along with Agent Peyton Ritter from New York, to the case. Scully's partner Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) looks at the material on Scully's desk and points out that the case looks like an X-file—and that Kersh is obviously splitting them up.|$|R
40|$|Since {{the physics}} of air {{entrainment}} is not yet clearly understood, most of the fire plume expressions {{reported in the literature}} were derived empirically. Experiments with different fire geometry, fuels, and ambient conditions would be difficult when trying to derive comprehensive plume temperature and velocity fields from existing theories. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD), a practical engineering tool in fire engineering, might give {{a better understanding of the}} plume behavior. This technique can eliminate factors which are difficult to control in experiments, but would affect the plume movement. Aerodynamics for thermally induced plumes is studied by CFD in this article. Three types of thermal plumes such as axisymmetric plume, balcony <b>spill</b> plume, and <b>door</b> plume are considered. Four axisymmetric plume equations and three balcony spill plume models are assessed by comparing with the CFD results. For door plumes, qualitative results of the mass entrainment rate are obtained. Investigations in this article are useful for fire engineers in designing smoke management systems in an affordable fashion. This is a critical point in implementing an engineering performance-based fire code. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
