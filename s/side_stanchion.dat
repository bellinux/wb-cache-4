25|$|The Sharks {{advanced}} to the Western Conference Semi-finals to face the third-seed Detroit Red Wings, whom they had defeated in five games during the previous post-season's second round. Just like the year prior, the Sharks won the first three games of the series and lost the fourth but instead of replicating the previous year's success in Game 5, the Sharks dropped two more games as the Red Wings became the eighth team in NHL history to force a Game 7 after losing the first three games of a series. However, they would not become the 4th team in history {{to pull off the}} comeback as the Sharks prevailed, 3–2, with the game-winning goal scored by former captain Patrick Marleau who had endured media criticism from former teammate and now NBC Sports Network television personality Jeremy Roenick for his lackluster play in Game 5 of the series against the Red Wings. The Sharks {{advanced to}} their third Western Conference Finals series, their first playoff meeting with the Vancouver Canucks. San Jose dropped the first two games of the series at Rogers Arena in Vancouver but rebounded with a 4–3 victory thanks to two first-period goals by Marleau in Game 3. However, they lost the fourth game of the series and eventually were eliminated from the playoffs after a Game 5 in Vancouver that featured a game-tying goal by the Canucks' Ryan Kesler with 18.3 seconds remaining in the third period as well as a quirky bounce off a <b>side</b> <b>stanchion</b> that allowed Kevin Bieksa to score the overtime goal that advanced Vancouver to their third Stanley Cup Finals and left the Sharks knocked out in Round 3 for the second consecutive post-season.|$|E
50|$|On March 31, 2011, the Sharks {{clinched}} their 13th (and seventh consecutive) {{playoff berth}} {{in franchise history}} with a 6-0 victory over the Dallas Stars. Five days later, they clinched their sixth Pacific Division championship. Entering the 2011 playoffs as the second seed in the Western Conference, the Sharks opened their playoff run with the franchise's first-ever playoff series against division and state rivals Los Angeles. After winning Game 1, 3-2 in overtime on a Joe Pavelski goal, the Sharks dropped the second game of the series 4-0, heading to Staples Center with the series tied at one apiece. The Kings took another 4-0 lead in Game 3 but five-second-period goals by the Sharks capped with a Devin Setoguchi overtime winner gave the Sharks a 6-5 victory and tied them for the second-biggest comeback in Stanley Cup playoff history. They {{would go on to}} win Game 4, lose Game 5 and finally win the series in its sixth game, with captain Joe Thornton scoring the series winner in the third overtime game of the series.

50|$|The {{main part}} of the car bodies were painted crimson lake but this faded to brown. The panels were {{initially}} edged with gold leaf but this was later discontinued. The underframe, beam, fenders and panels below windows were painted Indian red. The bulkheads, rocker panels and <b>side</b> <b>stanchions</b> were cream, the roof was white, and decency boards along the top deck grey. Inside panels were varnished wood and brass handrails were fitted.|$|R

The components inlcude an ankle-foot orthosis and upwardly extending <b>side</b> braces of <b>stanchion</b> form with an upper securing strap arrangement for securely surrounding a user's lower leg, a second pair of <b>side</b> braces of <b>stanchion</b> form with an upper securing strap arrangement for securely surrounding a user's thigh, and knee joint assemblies joining the ends of the braces to simulate the normal action of a user's knee during flexion and extension of the leg. The flexible cable arrangement allows the user to rigidly hold the entire unit in aligned, fixed relation when the leg is extended. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|R
60|$|We had now {{but one of}} our {{starboard}} nine-pounders on its carriage, {{and word}} came from below that our battery of twelves was all but knocked to scrap iron, and their ports blown into one yawning gap. Indeed, {{we did not have}} to be told that <b>sides</b> and <b>stanchions</b> had been carried away, for the deck trembled and teetered under us as we dragged 'Scolding Sairy' from her stand in the larboard waist, clearing a lane for her between the bodies. Our feet slipped and slipped as we hove, and burning bits of sails and splinters dropping from aloft fell unheeded on our heads and shoulders. With the energy of desperation I was bending to the pull, when the Malay in front of me sank dead across the tackle. But, ere I could touch him, he was tenderly lifted aside, and a familiar figure seized the rope where the dead man's hands had warmed it. Truly, the commodore was everywhere that night.|$|R
