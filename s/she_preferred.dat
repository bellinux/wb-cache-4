5|$|Charlotte {{rejected}} this support: {{the party}} of independence sought to establish a constitutional monarchy headed by Charlotte, but <b>she</b> <b>preferred</b> to retain the power of an absolutist monarchy. Consequently, she denounced the letter and organized the detention of Diego Paroissien. Paroissien, who had several letters to the criollos, was charged with high treason. Castelli was his lawyer.|$|E
5|$|In 1970 she {{travelled}} {{on her own}} to Paris to {{get away}} from her marriage and family commitments. There she had a love affair with the Egyptian scholar Ahmed Al-Haggagi. He encouraged her to work on Arab patterns, sketching for her the basis of her Poppy (not the same as Unikko). Her Arab-inspired patterns of this period include Kungatar, Naamio, Sadunkertoja, Tumma, and Välly. In 1971 she separated from Tissari, realizing that <b>she</b> <b>preferred</b> to live alone. She spent three years in Algeria, taking a lover named Muhamed.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} how strong Matilda's {{personal}} piety was, although contemporaries praised her lifelong preference to be buried at the monastic site of Bec rather than the grander but more worldly Rouen, and believed her to have substantial, underlying religious beliefs. Like {{other members of the}} Anglo-Norman nobility, she bestowed considerable patronage on the Church. Early on in her life, <b>she</b> <b>preferred</b> the well-established Benedictine monastery of Cluny alongside some of the newer Augustinian orders, such as the Victorines and Premonstratensians. As part of this patronage, she re-founded the abbey of Notre-Dame-du-Vœu near Cherbourg.|$|E

5|$|Lazzell's {{paintings}} {{demonstrated a}} rich and nuanced use of color. <b>She</b> <b>preferred</b> French watercolor pigments that, alongside {{the grain of the}} woodblocks, created embossed lines and striated patterns. Typically the woodblocks she created were made from cherry or basswood and she only pulled three or four prints from each woodblock. From 1916 to 1955, Lazzell created 138 woodblocks. Modern exhibitions of Lazzell's artworks have included the woodblocks themselves.|$|E
5|$|Although she has {{campaigned on}} her husband's behalf since {{early in his}} {{political}} career by handshaking and fund-raising, she did not relish the activity at first. When she campaigned during her husband's 2000 run for United States House of Representatives, her boss at the University of Chicago {{asked if there was}} any single thing about campaigning that she enjoyed; after some thought, she replied that visiting so many living rooms had given her some new decorating ideas. Obama opposed her husband's run for the congressional seat, and, after his defeat, <b>she</b> <b>preferred</b> he tend to the financial needs of the family in what she deemed a more practical way.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Coffin {{fell ill}} {{with a serious}} hip {{infection}} that forced her to curtail much of her physical activity and required a lengthy stay in hospital. She moved to a newly acquired house in New Haven, Connecticut, although she continued to maintain her office in New York and commuted there daily. Coffin often entertained guests in New Haven (and recruited several Connecticut notables as new clients), holding teas, cocktail parties, musical events and buffet suppers. The garden, which she had laid out herself, became the site of garden parties in the summer months. <b>She</b> <b>preferred</b> the company of young architects, artists, musicians and writers, though she could be curt towards those she took a dislike to; on one occasion, she snubbed Hilaire Belloc when he asked her which of his books she had read.|$|E

5|$|O'Brien {{grew up in}} {{the rural}} town of Wellington, 360 {{kilometres}} (225 miles) from Sydney. Neither of his parents were skilled swimmers. His father Roy knew only one swimming stroke—the breaststroke—and his mother Thelma did not take her first swimming lesson until she was 55. O'Brien's sister Ann was a talented swimmer in her childhood years, but <b>she</b> <b>preferred</b> horseback riding. The local pool was an old-style facility that had no pump system and was only manually drained once a week. Aged four, O'Brien got his first swimming lessons from the local Learn to Swim program. There were not many non-sporting activities for children in Wellington, and O'Brien played basketball and rugby league, did athletics and swimming, and rode horses. In 1954, a chlorinated pool was built in the town, leading to the formation of Wellington Swimming Club. At the age of 10, O'Brien began competitive swimming under local coach Bert Eslick, and raced in regional country swimming carnivals at Dubbo, Bathurst and Orange.|$|E

25|$|Throughout Catherine's reign {{she tried}} to find a balance between liberal {{political}} economic ideas in the tradition of Adam Smith, and the strong regulation started by Peter I. <b>She</b> <b>preferred</b> hired labor in industry, lowered internal tariffs and custom duties, and did not support monopolies.
