25|$|After {{the end of}} the Second World War, Barth {{became an}} {{important}} voice in support both of German penitence and of reconciliation with churches abroad. Together with Hans-Joachim Iwand, he authored the Darmstadt Statement in 1947– a more concrete statement of German guilt and responsibility for the Third Reich and Second World War than the 1945 <b>Stuttgart</b> <b>Declaration</b> of Guilt. In it, he made the point that the Church's willingness to side with anti-socialist and conservative forces had led to its susceptibility for National Socialist ideology. In the context of the developing Cold War, that controversial statement was rejected by anti-Communists in the West who supported the CDU course of re-militarization, as well as by East German dissidents who believed that it did not sufficiently depict the dangers of Communism. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1950. In the 1950s, Barth sympathized with the peace movement and opposed German rearmament.|$|E

In declarations appended to the minutes, however, each Member State laid down its interpretation of when a vote should take place. Only Britain and Denmark supported the original French position of 1965. France and Ireland now spelt out that the national interest in question must relate directly to the subject under discussion and they, like Greece, took the view that the vote should only be postponed if a Member State invokes an '"essential" [...] national interest [...] "in writing". Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, Italy and the Netherlands took the view that a vote should be held whenever the treaties provide for it.|$|R

The Council issued the <b>Stuttgart</b> <b>Declaration</b> of Guilt in October 1945 in which it confessed guilt for the failure of the Protestant church not to oppose the Nazis and the Third Reich. Heinemann {{regarded}} the declaration as a [...] "linchpin" [...] in his work for the church.|$|E
50|$|He was a {{national}} conservative and initially a supporter of Adolf Hitler, but {{he became one of}} the founders of the Confessing Church, which opposed the nazification of German Protestant churches. He vehemently opposed the Nazis' Aryan Paragraph, but made remarks about Jews that some scholars have called antisemitic. For his opposition to the Nazis' state control of the churches, Niemöller was imprisoned in Sachsenhausen and Dachau concentration camps from 1938 to 1945. He narrowly escaped execution. After his imprisonment, he expressed his deep regret about not having done enough to help the victims of the Nazis. He turned away from his earlier nationalistic beliefs and was one of the initiators of the <b>Stuttgart</b> <b>Declaration</b> of Guilt. From the 1950s on, he was a vocal pacifist and anti-war activist, and vice-chair of War Resisters' International from 1966 to 1972. He met with Ho Chi Minh during the Vietnam War and was a committed campaigner for nuclear disarmament.|$|E
50|$|After 1945, the Evangelical Church in Germany led by Theophil Wurm (who {{was also}} Bishop of Württemberg) issued the <b>Stuttgart</b> <b>Declaration</b> of Guilt and {{actively}} contributed to reconciliation efforts with Italy (and France) based on {{relationships with the}} diaspora. The 1948 centenary festivities of the Savoy civil rights declaration were used for efforts of EKD leading staff to support German Italian reconciliation after WW-II. A most fruitful cooperation was established at the community level, with Waldensian delegates from both sides pioneering. 1949, Guglielmo Del Pesco (1889-1951), moderator of the Tavola Valdese (Waldensian round table), was invited back to Maulbronn, celebrating the 250th anniversary of the Waldensian emigration to Germany. He was unable to come for reasons of health but sent A. Jalla, a teacher, described as being full of spite and hatred against all things German after 1945, but who joined in the effort for reconciliation 1949. Based on these experiences, the first town-twinning partnership between Germany and France was signed 1950 between Ludwigsburg and the Protestant exclave Montbéliard, again based on a special connection of the Württemberg Landeskirche. The German Gustavus Adolphus Union is supportive of Waldesian projects and charitable efforts in Italy till the present.|$|E

This essay examines how Torrance’s analysis of forgiveness casts fresh light on the process whereby relations between the Protestant churches of Europe and America were restored in the chaotic aftermath of postwar Germany. The essay argues that the result of their meeting for reconciliation, the <b>Stuttgart</b> <b>Declaration</b> of Guilt, prepared the way for the Allies to set aside policies of collective punishment in favor of policies which supported reconciliation and restoration of relationships...|$|E
40|$|From the Introduction]. European Union {{has been}} the {{theoretical}} goal of the Europcan Community (EC) since its conception. For many, the intention was that it remained a theoretical goal to be dreamed of but never achieved. The Treaty of Rome, signed in 1957, called for an "ever closer union among the peoples of Europe", yet the first two decades after its signing saw {{little in the way}} of progress towards union. Indeed General de Gaulle's opposition to majority voting in the Council and ringing endorsement of a 'Europe des parties' in 1966 was a serious reversion to intergovernmentalism. Depressed by years of slide and stagnation Europe's leaders attempted in the early ' 80 s to kick-start the Community into a new life. The <b>Stuttgart</b> <b>Declaration,</b> signed by the Heads of Governments at their summit there in June 1983, resolved to "create a United Europe" and confirmed "their commitment to ever closer union amongst the peoples and Member States of the European Community"...|$|E
