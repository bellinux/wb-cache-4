5|$|A {{direct method}} for {{producing}} an MSA uses the dynamic programming technique {{to identify the}} globally optimal alignment solution. For proteins, this method usually involves two sets of parameters: a gap penalty and a <b>substitution</b> matrix assigning scores or probabilities to the alignment of each possible pair of amino acids based on the similarity of the amino acids' chemical properties and the evolutionary probability of the mutation. For nucleotide sequences a similar gap penalty is used, but a much simpler <b>substitution</b> matrix, wherein only identical matches and mismatches are considered, is typical. The scores in the <b>substitution</b> matrix may be either all positive or a mix {{of positive and negative}} {{in the case of a}} global alignment, but must be both positive and negative, in the case of a local alignment.|$|E

Parallel <b>substitutions</b> are a nice presentation of <b>substitutions</b> as rst-class objects of the calculus, and make it easy to adapt proofs to proof assistants. We will also deal with hereditary <b>substitutions,</b> a new approach to normalisation that is structurally recursive.

40|$|This paper proposes an {{implementation}} {{of objects and}} functions via a calculus with explicit <b>substitutions</b> which is confluent and preserves strong normalization. The source calculus corresponds to {{the combination of the}} σ-calculus of Abadi and Cardelli [AC 96] and the λ-calculus, and the target calculus corresponds to an extension of the former calculus with explicit <b>substitutions.</b> The interesting feature of our calculus is that <b>substitutions</b> are separated [...] and treated accordingly [...] in two different kinds: those used to encode ordinary <b>substitutions</b> and those encoding invoke <b>substitutions.</b> When working with explicit <b>substitutions,</b> this differentiation is essential to encode λ-calculus into σ-calculus in a conservative way, following the style proposed in [AC 96]...|$|R

50|$|Explicit <b>substitutions</b> were sketched in {{the preface}} of Curry's book on Combinatory logicand grew out of an ‘implementation trick’ used, for example, by AUTOMATH, and became a respectable {{syntactic}} theory in lambda calculus and rewriting theory. Despite it should actually be credited to de Bruijn, {{the idea of a}} specific calculus where <b>substitutions</b> are part of the object language, and not of the informal meta-theory, is traditionally credited to Abadi, Cardelli, Curien, and Lévy. Their seminal paper on the &lambda;&sigma; calculus explains that implementations of lambda calculus need to be very careful when dealing with <b>substitutions.</b> Without sophisticated mechanisms for structure-sharing, <b>substitutions</b> can cause a size explosion, and therefore, in practice, <b>substitutions</b> are delayed and explicitly recorded. This makes the correspondence between the theory and the implementation highly non-trivial and correctness of implementations can be hard to establish. One solution is to make the <b>substitutions</b> part of the calculus, that is, to have a calculus of explicit <b>substitutions.</b>|$|R

Our main observation {{is that there are}} non-trivial interactions between linearity and explicit <b>substitutions</b> and that xDILL is therefore best understood as a synthesis of its underlying logical structure and the technology of explicit <b>substitutions.</b> This is in contrast to the *oe-calculus where the explicit <b>substitutions</b> are independent of the underlying logical structure...|$|R
