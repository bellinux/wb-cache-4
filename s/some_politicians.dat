5|$|Moldova's {{constitution}} forbids {{the country}} from joining a military alliance, but <b>some</b> <b>politicians,</b> such as Moldovan Minister of Defence Vitalie Marinuța, have suggested joining NATO {{as part of a}} larger European integration. Moldova joined NATO's Partnership for Peace in 1994, and initiated an Individual Partnership Action Plan in 2010. Following the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia, NATO officials warned that Russia might seek to annex Transnistria, a breakaway Moldovan region. This separatist issue could preclude Moldova from joining NATO.|$|E

5|$|The Fiery Trial {{begins with}} Lincoln's {{encounters}} with slavery {{in his early}} life, growing up in Kentucky and Indiana. He occasionally dealt with issues of slavery in his law practice in Illinois. The book also discusses Lincoln's position on slavery {{in the context of}} his political career. Lincoln was a moderate, attempting {{to bridge the gap between}} the abolitionist Radical Republicans and conservative Democrats, including those in the slave-holding states, whom he hoped would choose preserving the Union over steadfastly defending slavery. Lincoln initially supported the idea of voluntary colonization of freed blacks to Africa, a stance supported by <b>some</b> <b>politicians</b> at the time, although considered unethical by many. However, Lincoln eventually abandoned his moderate stance on slavery when he determined that to win the American Civil War, he needed to act to end slavery.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} Katyn {{memorials}} in the UK, {{the best known}} of which was unveiled on 18 September 1976 at Gunnersbury Cemetery in London, amid considerable controversy. During the period of the Cold War, successive British governments objected to plans by the UK's Polish community to build a major monument to commemorate the massacre. The Soviet Union did not want Katyn to be remembered, and put pressure on Britain to prevent the creation of the monument. As a result, the construction of the monument was delayed for many years. After the local community had finally secured the right to build the monument, no official government representative was present at the opening ceremony (although <b>some</b> <b>politicians</b> did attend the event unofficially).|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, Oslo had a {{rapid transit}} network that {{branched}} out north-east and north-west {{from the city}} centre. In 1987, the western and eastern network were connected, and through-trains started operating between the two networks from 1993. Plans to make a second connection through the borough of Nordre Aker were launched by politicians in the 1980s. It was argued that this was cheaper than building roads, with the per-kilometre price being {{about a quarter of}} that for motorways. <b>Some</b> <b>politicians</b> also saw the Ring Line as an opportunity to close all parts of the Oslo Tramway, except the Ekeberg- and Lilleaker Line. Oslo Sporveier, the contemporary operator of the metro, started planning the line during the late 1980s. The plans would take advantage of the Gjøvik Line's right-of-way between Storo and Sinsen, while the section from Storo to Tåsen would have to be built in a tunnel.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, Batista's {{government}} held presidential elections, but no politician {{stood against}} him; {{the election was}} widely considered fraudulent. It had allowed some political opposition to be voiced, and Castro's supporters had agitated for an amnesty for the Moncada incident's perpetrators. <b>Some</b> <b>politicians</b> suggested an amnesty would be good publicity, and the Congress and Batista agreed. Backed by the U.S. and major corporations, Batista believed Castro to be no threat, and on May 15, 1955, the prisoners were released. Returning to Havana, Castro gave radio interviews and press conferences; the government closely monitored him, curtailing his activities. Now divorced, Castro had sexual affairs with two female supporters, Naty Revuelta and Maria Laborde, each conceiving him a child. Setting about strengthening the MR-26-7, he established an 11-person National Directorate but retained autocratic control, with some dissenters labeling him a caudillo (dictator); he argued that a successful revolution could not be run by committee and required a strong leader.|$|E
