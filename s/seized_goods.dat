5000|$|The {{most common}} writ is the [...] "writ of control", known until 2014 as a [...] "writ of fieri facias". [...] This writ is {{essentially}} debt-collection, but it actually {{takes the form}} of an order to the officers to <b>seize</b> <b>goods,</b> from the judgment debtor, worth a particular amount of money; the HCEO will attend the debtor's premises, <b>seize</b> the <b>goods,</b> and then sell them at auction.|$|R

25|$|German forces {{held the}} Dunkirk Pocket through the Siege of Dunkirk {{to the end}} of the war, when they surrendered. 10,000 Germans were taken {{prisoner}} on 9 May 1945. 3,700 Germans were kept in the Dunkirk area, with many at the Fort des Dunes. The prisoners were engaged in cleanup and mine removal. After the departure of the prisoners the fort was transferred to the customs service, who used it as a storage centre for <b>seized</b> <b>goods.</b> A customs officer and his family lived at the fort. The fort went back to the army in 1955, which began excavations to recover the remains of those killed in 1940. A ceremony of re-interment was held in August 1955, attended by the widow of General Janssen. The fort was then abandoned for twenty years. In 1978 a local organization was formed to preserve the fort as a center for military reserve functions. By 1990 the fort had been made habitable.|$|E
500|$|Apart {{from that}} brief period in 1861 when {{supplies}} were adequate, Georgia soldiers were chronically {{in need of}} basic essentials. In December 1862, the Georgia Legislature appropriated $1,500,000 {{for the purchase of}} military clothing and blankets. Anticipating the inadequacy of that measure, it also authorized Governor Brown to seize factories and supplies, as needed. The Governor executed the order, but authorized Foster to pay sellers 10% and manufacturers 25% of the value of their <b>seized</b> <b>goods.</b> Foster, {{in the course of his}} duty, appealed to the people's [...] "love of liberty" [...] in meeting the demands placed upon them. While Foster's actions benefited the troops, the effect on civilians was harsh. According to the New Georgia Encyclopedia, [...] "The Quartermaster Department's persistent purchases (or impressments) of the bulk of the state's textile and shoe manufactures left civilians facing intense scarcity and exorbitant prices. These conditions often led to accusations of profiteering." [...] While civilians may have faced scarcities and high prices, conditions for many Georgia soldiers were far worse. In late August 1863, following the Battle of Gettysburg, one Georgia Colonel forwarded a requisition to Foster [...] "in which he reported his command as destitute of everything". Men in his unit had worn out two pairs of shoes on the Northern march, and [...] "all faced the prospect of frostbite, pleurisy, or pneumonia in the coming winter." [...] By this period of the war, Gettysburg historian John Heiser observes: ...|$|E

These at once proceeded to lay hold of all our goods and chattels, in order to bear them for us, excepting only the guns, which they would on no account touch.

50|$|However, {{after the}} death of Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1616, a change in the foreign policy of the Bakufu ordered the closing of the English merchants' office in 1623, which {{consequently}} prompted the English to leave Japan. The English were refused permission to return in 1673. In 1808, the British ship Phaeton <b>seized</b> <b>goods</b> in Nagasaki and by 1825 the Bakufu ordered the feudal lords to repel all foreign ships, except the Dutch and Chinese.|$|E

When the Spanish raided the Bahamas, the Bahamians in turn commissioned privateers against Spain, even though England and Spain were at peace. In 1684 the Spanish burned the settlements on New Providence and Eleuthera, after which they were largely abandoned. New Providence was settled a second time in 1686 by colonists from Jamaica.|$|R

5000|$|A High Court {{enforcement}} officer (HCEO) is {{an officer of}} the High Court of England and Wales responsible for enforcing judgements of the High Court, often by <b>seizing</b> <b>goods</b> or repossessing property.

HCEOs operate only in England and Wales; Scotland has always had a different legal system, and Scottish sheriffs are a type of Judge.|$|R
25|$|All {{the states}} {{actually}} go further than Commonwealth law requires and ban {{the sale of}} X18+ rated material, though possessing it after ordering it from elsewhere is legal (except {{in parts of the}} Northern Territory). Therefore, all legal sale of X18+ rated material in Australia occurs by mail order from the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. In practice, sex shops commonly carry extensive stocks of X-rated films regardless of the law. However the police still can use the laws to raid premises, <b>seize</b> <b>goods</b> and perhaps prosecute, as happened in 2010 in St Marys, New South Wales.|$|R
