5|$|After {{the end of}} the Soviet Union, two {{problems}} arose for the project. The first was geopolitical in nature: the main spacecraft control center was located at the Yevpatoria facility in the Crimea region. This control center was <b>significant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Soviet space program, being one of only two in the country equipped with a 70m dish antenna. With the breakup of the Union, the Crimea region, although mostly populated by ethnic Russians, found itself part of the newly independent Ukraine and the center was put under Ukrainian national control, prompting new political hurdles.|$|E

The vaginal smear and body {{weight of the}} rats were recorded daily and rats were sacrificed on 31 st day. Estrous cycle was effected by showing a <b>significant</b> decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of estrous cycle, duration of proestrus, estrus and metestrus with concomitant <b>significant</b> increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> duration of diestrus <b>in</b> all <b>the</b> mancozeb treated groups when compared with controls. There were a <b>significant</b> decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of healthy follicles and a <b>significant</b> increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> number of atretic follicles <b>in</b> all <b>the</b> mancozeb treated groups when compared with controls. The histologic observation of the ovary revealed the presence of less number of corpora lutea {{and the size of}} the ovary was also reduced in high doses of mancozeb treated rats. There was a <b>significant</b> increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> thyroid weight <b>in</b> all <b>the</b> mancozeb treated rats except in 500 mg/kg/d.

5|$|As Evolve is multiplayer-focused, {{the design}} team put less time and focus into {{developing}} Evolves narrative and campaign. Conversations between characters were reduced during the multiplayer mode as the design team {{thought that it}} would negatively impact on the conversations between players. However, the story and narrative became more <b>significant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> single-player mode. Evolve does not adapt traditional storytelling methods, nor use a campaign mode, instead, players learn about the Hunters' backstory and the fictional world of Shear by slowly progressing through Evolve. Playing as different characters would also lead to different conversations and dialogues between characters.|$|E
5|$|As for Casler's third {{possible}} explanation for nominative determinism, genetics, researchers Voracek, Rieder, Stieger, and Swami found some evidence for it in 2015. They reported that today's Smiths still tend to have the physical capabilities of their ancestors who were smiths. People called Smith reported above-average aptitude for strength-related activities. A similar aptitude for dexterity-related activities among people with the surname Tailor, or equivalent spellings thereof, was found, {{but it was not}} statistically <b>significant.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> researchers' view a genetic-social hypothesis appears more viable than the hypothesis of implicit egotism effects.|$|E

With his many writings about the dangers of environmental destruction, Beebe helped to raise public awareness about this topic. However, Beebe's prolific writing for a popular audience had a downside, in that other scientists of his time were reluctant to hold him in high accord because they regarded him as a popularizer.|$|E

5|$|In {{the eastern}} Pacific, Category5 hurricanes usually occur only in El Niño years.

Although Orkney is in many ways very distinct from the other islands and archipelagos of Scotland these trends are very similar to those experienced elsewhere. The archipelago's population grew by 11% in the decade to 2011 as recorded by the census. During the same period Scottish island populations as a whole grew by 4% to 103,702.|$|E

5|$|The Civil War {{brought with}} it {{the end of the}} {{consensus}} among English Protestants {{that there should be a}} single church imposed by the state, though there was still not complete freedom of religion. The ideals of the dissenting brethren of the Assembly were <b>significant</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rise of denominationalism, the doctrine that the church is found in several institutions rather than a single one in a given location. Though Protestants already commonly recognized the validity of churches in different territories, the outcome of the Assembly's debates marks the wider acceptance of the idea that several true churches may be found in the same territory.|$|E
