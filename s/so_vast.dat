5|$|Among {{the books}} that include the story of Lebrón are The Ladies' Gallery: A Memoir of Family Secrets by Irene Vilar (Lebrón's granddaughter), {{translated}} by Gregory Rabassa (formerly published as A Message from God in the Atomic Age). The author criticizes her grandmother as a distant, gun-toting, larger-than-life figure who cast a veil of pain and secrecy over her family <b>so</b> <b>vast</b> that Ms. Vilar is still untangling herself from it. It also documents the death of Lebrón's only daughter (Vilar's mother) as suicide.|$|E
5|$|According to Lafcadio Hearn, a {{butterfly}} {{was seen in}} Japan as the personification of a person's soul; whether they be living, dying, or already dead. One Japanese superstition says that if {{a butterfly}} enters your guest room and perches behind the bamboo screen, the person whom you most love is coming to see you. Large numbers of butterflies are viewed as bad omens. When Taira no Masakado was secretly preparing for his famous revolt, there appeared in Kyoto <b>so</b> <b>vast</b> a swarm of butterflies that the people were frightened— thinking the apparition to be a portent of coming evil.|$|E
5|$|In the post-Vijayanagara era, the Kaivalya {{tradition}} branched three ways. The first {{consisted of}} {{followers of the}} Nijaguna Shivayogi school, the second was more elitist and brahminical in nature and followed the writings of Mahalingaranga (1675), while the third was the branch that kept the vachana tradition alive. Well-known poet-saints from this vachana tradition were Shivayogi's contemporary Muppina Sadakshari, whose collection of songs are called the Subodhasara; Chidananda Avadhuta of the 17th century; and Sarpabhushana Shivayogi of the 18th century. <b>So</b> <b>vast</b> is this body of literature that much of it {{still needs to be}} studied.|$|E

5|$|Rum-runners {{used the}} Everglades as a hiding spot during Prohibition; it was <b>so</b> <b>vast</b> there were never enough law {{enforcement}} officers to patrol it. The arrival of the railroad, and the discovery that adding trace elements like copper was the remedy for crops sprouting and dying quickly, soon created a population boom. New towns such as Moore Haven, Clewiston, and Belle Glade sprouted like the crops. Sugarcane became the primary crop grown in South Florida. Miami experienced a second real estate boom that earned a developer in Coral Gables $150million. Undeveloped land north of Miami sold for $30,600 an acre. In 1925, Miami newspapers published editions weighing over , {{most of it in}} real estate advertising. Waterfront property was the most highly valued. Mangrove trees were cut down and replaced with palm trees to improve the view. Acres of South Florida slash pine were cleared. Some of the pine was for lumber, but most of the pine forests in Dade County were cleared for development.|$|E

25|$|In {{the world}} of commerce, Srivijaya rose rapidly to be a far-flung empire {{controlling}} the two passages between India and China, namely the Sunda Strait from Palembang and the Malacca Strait from Kedah. Arab accounts state that the empire of the Srivijayan Maharaja was <b>so</b> <b>vast</b> that the swiftest vessel {{would not have been}} able to travel round all its islands within two years. The islands the accounts referred to produced camphor, aloes, sandal-wood, spices like cloves, nutmegs, cardamom and cubebs, as well as ivory, gold and tin, all of which equalled the wealth of the Maharaja to any king in India.|$|E
25|$|The Imperial Family {{were not}} the only {{residents}} of the palace; below the metal framework in the attics lived an army of servants. <b>So</b> <b>vast</b> were the servants' quarters that a former servant and his family, unbeknownst to the palace authorities, moved into the roof of the palace. They were only discovered by the smell of the manure from the cow that they had also smuggled into the building with them to provide fresh milk. It seems this cow was not the only bovine in the attics; other cows were kept next to the room occupied by the Maids of Honour, in order to provide fresh milk for the kitchens. This practice was discontinued after the 1837 fire.|$|E
25|$|Charles II {{had become}} king {{following}} the death of his father, Philip IV, in 1665, but he was physically weak and incapable of having children; he was the last male Spanish Habsburg, and he had survived longer than anyone had expected. When the Treaty of Ryswick (Rijswijk) brought an end to the Nine Years' War (1688–1697), European statesmen turned their attention to resolve the problem of the Spanish Succession before the death of Charles II should actually take place. Ultimately, the main rivals for the Spanish inheritance were the heirs and descendants of the Bourbon King Louis XIV of France, and the Austrian Habsburg Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold I, both of whom were sons-in-law to Philip IV of Spain and grandsons of Philip III, and both firmly believed in their claims. However, the inheritance was <b>so</b> <b>vast</b> that its transference would dramatically increase either French or Austrian power, which, due to the implied threat of European hegemony, was of utmost importance to Europe as a whole.|$|E
30|$|The local {{thresholding}} {{is one of}} {{the techniques}} which can be useful particularly when the scene illumination varies locally over time [19]. In modules 2 and 3, the interest's pixels and their neighbouring areas are masked <b>so</b> that <b>vast</b> amount of pixel intensity from each frame can be automatically eliminated. Correspondingly, using global thresholding over this mask, we can obtain the same result as the local thresholding.|$|R

25|$|The {{upper part}} of the thermosphere, where the mean free path of the {{molecules}} exceeds the scale height, is called the exosphere. The lower boundary of the Uranian exosphere, the exobase, is located at a height of about 6,500km, or 1/4 of the planetary radius, above the surface. The exosphere is unusually extended, reaching as far as several Uranian radii from the planet. It is made mainly of hydrogen atoms and is often called the hydrogen corona of Uranus. The high temperature and relatively high pressure {{at the base of the}} thermosphere explain in part why Uranus's exosphere is <b>so</b> <b>vast.</b> The number density of atomic hydrogen in the corona falls slowly with the distance from the planet, remaining as high a few hundred atoms per cm3 at a few radii from Uranus. The effects of this bloated exosphere include a drag on small particles orbiting Uranus, causing a general depletion of dust in the Uranian rings. The infalling dust in turn contaminates the upper atmosphere of the planet.|$|E

The court called the idea of Brahmin families descending from an unbroken line of common ancestors {{as indicated by the}} names of their respective gotras impossible to accept. The court consulted relevant Hindu texts and stressed the need for Hindu society and law {{to keep up with the}} times emphasising that notions of good social behaviour and the general ideology of Hindu society had changed.
