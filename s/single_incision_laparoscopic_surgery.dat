40|$|Abstract During {{bariatric surgery}} in morbidly obese patients, the surgeon’s {{operative}} view is often {{obscured by the}} hypertrophic fatty left lobe of the liver. The use of a conventional liver retractor mandates an additional sub-xiphoid wound, resulting in pain and scar formation, {{in addition to the}} risk of iatrogenic liver injury during retractor insertion. To overcome these limitations, we developed a simple, rapid, and safe technique for liver retraction—V-shaped liver suspension technique (V-LIST) —by using a Penrose drain and laparoscopic stapler. A silicone Penrose drain was inserted into the peritoneal cavity and stapled to the pars condensa of the lesser omentum and parietal peritoneum using a laparoscopic stapler. The left lobe of the liver was retracted by the V-shaped suspension. At the end of the surgery, the drain could be easily removed. In October 2009 –February 2010, 14 patients underwent liver retraction with the use of this technique. We performed 12 Roux-en-Y gastric bypasses and 2 sleeve gastrectomies. This series also included three cases of <b>single</b> <b>incision</b> transumbilical <b>laparoscopic</b> <b>surgery.</b> The mean time re-quired to complete the liver retraction was 8 min 21 s (range, 2 – 18 min 40 s). Retraction was appropriate in all patients, without the need for additional retractors or conversion. There were no V-LIST-related perioperative complications. Our V-LIST technique using a Penrose drain is safe and simple. It has potential applications in <b>single</b> <b>incision</b> <b>laparoscopic</b> bariatric procedures...|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{prospective}} {{case series}} of <b>single</b> <b>incision</b> multiport <b>laparoscopic</b> colorectal resections for malignancy using conventional laparoscopic trocars and instruments is described. Materials and Methods: Eleven patients (seven men and four women) with colonic or rectal pathology underwent <b>single</b> <b>incision</b> multiport <b>laparoscopic</b> colectomy/rectal resection from July till December 2010. Four trocars {{were placed in}} a <b>single</b> transumblical <b>incision.</b> The bowel was mobilized laparoscopically and vessels controlled intracorporeally with either intra or extracorporeal anastomosis. Results: Three patients had carcinoma in the caecum, one in the hepatic flexure, two in the rectosigmoid, one in the descending colon, two in the rectum and two had ulcerative pancolitis (one with high grade dysplasia and another with carcinoma rectum). There was no conversion to standard multiport laparoscopy or open surgery. The median age was 52 years (range 24 - 78 years). The average operating time was 130 min (range 90 - 210 min). The average incision length was 3. 2 cm (2. 5 - 4. 0 cm). There were no postoperative complications. The average length of stay was 4. 5 days (range 3 - 8 days). Histopathology showed adequate proximal and distal resection margins with an average lymph node yield of 25 nodes (range 16 - 30 nodes). Conclusion: <b>Single</b> <b>incision</b> multiport <b>laparoscopic</b> colorectal <b>surgery</b> for malignancy is feasible without extra cost or specialized ports/instrumentation. It does not compromise the oncological radicality of resection. Short-term results are encouraging. Long-term results are awaited...|$|R
5000|$|Recently, new {{techniques}} {{have been developed}} to perform this surgery through a single incision in the patient's umbilicus. This advanced technique is called Laparoendoscopic Single Site Surgery or [...] "LESS" [...] or <b>Single</b> <b>Incision</b> <b>Laparoscopic</b> <b>Surgery</b> or [...] "SILS". In this procedure, instead of making 3-4 four small different cuts (incisions), a single cut (incision) is made through the navel (umbilicus). Through this cut, specialized rotaculating instruments (straight instruments which can be bent once inside the abdomen) are inserted to do the operation. The advantage of LESS / SILS operation is that the number of cuts is further reduced to one and this cut is also not visible after the operation is done as it is hidden inside the navel. A meta-analysis published by Pankaj Garg et al. comparing conventional laparoscopic cholecystecomy to SILS Cholecystectomy demonstrated that SILS does have a cosmetic benefit over conventional four-hole laparoscopic cholecystectomy while having no advantage in postoperative pain and hospital stay. A significantly higher incidence of wound complications, specifically development of hernia, has been noted with SILS. SILS has also been associated with a higher risk for bile duct injury ...|$|E

40|$|Appendectomy is {{the most}} common {{abdominal}} operation performed as an emergency basis [1]. The advantage of laparoscopic technique over the conventional open surgery technique has been proven especially in women and obese patients [2 - 4]. The further improved version at present is the introduction of Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS). It is a new technique developed for performing operations without a visible scar and has become an area of active research and interest within general surgeons community. A number of procedures such as cholecystectomy, appendectomy and ect has been currently being performed using this method. In <b>Single</b> <b>Incision</b> <b>Laparoscopic</b> <b>Surgery</b> (SILS) appendectomy, it may be more advantageous to the patients by eliminating the scars and potentially diminishing postoperative pain. However, the role of the SILS appendectomy is still evolving since all published reports of the technique should be regarded as preliminary [5 – 7]. More studies evaluating the technique in different clinical situations as well as randomized controlled trials are needed in order to assess the real benefits of the SILS appendectomy in general surgical practice.

40|$|Aim: A {{meta-analysis}} {{was performed}} to compare the outcome of <b>single</b> <b>incision</b> <b>laparoscopic</b> right hemicolectomy with standard multiport laparoscopic right hemicolectomy. Method: A systematic search of databases was carried out to extract comparative studies (randomized and non-randomized, prospective and retrospective). Data were analysed according to Cochrane Collaboration guidelines. A meta-analysis was performed when the data permitted this form of analysis. Results: Nine comparative studies were retrieved comprising 241 patients with <b>single</b> <b>incision</b> and standard laparoscopy. None of these was randomized. There {{was no significant difference}} between the two methods for the primary end-points of mortality, morbidity and cancer-specific parameters and for the secondary end-points of operation time, blood loss, ileus, hospital stay and conversion. It was not possible to analyse pain and cosmetics data owing to insufficient information.

40|$|Background: Numerous {{recent reports}} {{describe}} {{the performance of}} laparoscopic procedures through a <b>single</b> <b>incision.</b> Although the feasibility of this approach {{for a variety of}} procedures is currently being established, little data are available regarding safety. Case Report: A 65 -year-old female patient who was transferred from an outside institution had undergone a <b>single</b> <b>incision</b> <b>laparoscopic</b> cholecystectomy that resulted in biliary tract and vascular injuries. Methods: The patient was transferred with a known bile duct injury on the first postoperative day following <b>single</b> <b>incision</b> <b>laparoscopic</b> cholecystectomy. Review of her magnetic resonance imaging and percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram studies showed a Bismuth type 3 bile duct injury. Hepatic angiogram demonstrated an occlusion of the right hepatic artery with collateralization from the left hepatic artery. She was initially managed conservatively with a right-sided external biliary drain, followed 6 weeks later by a Hepp-Couinaud procedure to reconstruct the biliary tract. Conclusion: As new techniques evolve, it is imperative that safety, or potential side effects, or both safety and side effects, be monitored, because no learning curve is established for these new techniques. In these initial stages, surgeons should have a low threshold to add additional ports when necessary to ensure that procedures are completed safely.

Right iliac fossa port was the surgeon’s right hand port and left hand port was 5  mm SILS port. Left iliac fossa port and 5  mm SILS port were used by the assistant surgeon for retraction.
