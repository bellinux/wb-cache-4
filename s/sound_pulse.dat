5000|$|The {{system was}} {{developed}} {{to solve the problem}} of the target submarine disappearing from the attacking ship's ASDIC when the ship came within the sonar's minimum range.

40|$|In this thesis, the {{potential}} of the gap discharge transducer is investigated as transducers in a time-of-flight gas flow measurement setup designed for harsh environments. In this thesis the gap discharge transducer is operated in two different modes, named spark discharge transducer and glow discharge transducer. The spark discharge transducer generates a spark over a gap while the glow discharge transducer generates a continuous glow discharge. Earlier studies show that the spark discharge transducer is very durable and a potent <b>sound</b> <b>pulse</b> emitter. This thesis continues these studies by incorporating the spark discharge transducer into a flow measurement system as a <b>sound</b> <b>pulse</b> emitter. Further more, the gap discharge transducer is investigated as a potential <b>sound</b> <b>pulse</b> receiver. As an emitter in a flow measurement system the spark discharge transducer was placed in a pipe with a variable flow in a laboratory environment. The transducer was set to generate sparks to create the <b>sound</b> <b>pulse</b> and standard piezoelectric receivers were used to capture the signal. As a receiver, the gap discharge transducer was tested in two experiments. In the first experiment the spark discharge transducer was placed in a vacuum chamber to test the dependence between breakdown voltage and pressure. The pressure change from a <b>sound</b> <b>pulse</b> might cause breakdown in the gap of the transducer if an initial voltage between the electrodes is set close enough to breakdown. The breakdown leads to a spark which can be used to determine when a <b>sound</b> <b>pulse</b> arrives. In the second experiment the transducer was set to generate a glow discharge. The glow discharge was then subjected to a sound source. The voltage and current of the glow discharge depends on the environmental conditions in the gap. Pressure changes from a <b>sound</b> <b>pulse</b> will then affect the air in the gap which in turn changes the voltage and current characteristics of the discharge. The change in voltage and/or current can then be used to determine when a <b>sound</b> <b>pulse</b> has arrived. The investigation shows that the spark discharge transducer is a potential <b>sound</b> <b>pulse</b> emitter in a flow measurement system and could be capable of determining a flow quite accurately. As a receiver, the spark discharge transducer show limited potential. The pressure change of a spark generated <b>sound</b> <b>pulse</b> requires the receiver to be set very close to the breakdown voltage. But that close to the determined breakdown voltage will very often cause the gap to breakdown spontaneously. The glow discharge transducer, on the other hand, show promising potential. The transducer is proven to be able to receive sound waves and has a sensitivity that is deemed compatible with the spark discharge transducer as a <b>sound</b> <b>pulse</b> emitter.

40|$|In this thesis, the {{potential}} of the gap discharge transducer is investigated as both a <b>sound</b> <b>pulse</b> emitter and a <b>sound</b> <b>pulse</b> receiver in a gas flow measurement setup. The main objective is to use the gap discharge transducer as an integral part in a gas flow measurement system developed for harsh environments. The idea for the method considered in this study to determine the flow was taken from the time-of-flight technique used in ultrasonic flow measurements. The gap discharge transducer should then be used as both an emitter and a receiver in a setup that somewhat mimics those in ultrasonics. Earlier studies with the gap discharge transducer has shown that it is both very durable and a potent <b>sound</b> <b>pulse</b> emitter. This thesis continues these studies by incorporating the transducer into a measurement system as an emitter and also investigates its capabilities {{to be used as a}} <b>sound</b> <b>pulse</b> receiver. As an emitter in a flow measurement system the transducer was placed in a pipe with a variable flow in a laboratory environment. The transducer was set to generate sparks to create the <b>sound</b> <b>pulse</b> and standard piezoelectric receivers were used to capture the signal. To determine the possibilities to use the transducer as a receiver the transducer was placed in a vacuum chamber to test the dependence between breakdown voltage and pressure. Since a <b>sound</b> <b>pulse</b> is a change in pressure the pulse might cause breakdown in the gap between the electrodes of the transducer if an initial voltage between the electrodes is set close enough to breakdown. The investigation shows that the gap discharge transducer is a potential <b>sound</b> <b>pulse</b> emitter in a flow measurement system and, with some small calibration and more precise alignment, is capable to determine the flow quite accurately. On the other hand, to use the transducer as a receiver is concluded to be very difficult. The breakdown voltage is too unstable to allow an initial voltage close to breakdown to be set without risking spontaneous breakdown due to random events.
