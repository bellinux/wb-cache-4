5|$|The 2002 {{documentary}} , {{directed by}} James Cameron and filmed in May–June 2002 using {{smaller and more}} agile Mir submersibles, reconstructed the events leading to the sinking. These provided the first interior shots. His findings were {{that there was not}} enough damage below the waterline to confirm that she had been sunk rather than scuttled. Close inspection of the wreckage confirmed that none of the torpedoes or shells had penetrated the second layer of the inner hull. Using small ROVs to examine the interior, Cameron discovered that the torpedo blasts had failed to <b>shatter</b> <b>the</b> torpedo bulkheads.|$|E
5|$|Julian's {{best hope}} for a quick victory lay in a cavalry breakthrough. Not only was the German cavalry {{probably}} smaller than his own, but its lack of armour made it vulnerable to his armoured regiments, especially the cataphracts. If they could rout the enemy horse, his squadrons could then wheel and attack the German lines in the flank or rear, and the battle would {{be as good as}} won. Julian's cavalry would thus aim to deliver a shock charge, careering forward in a wedge formation with the cataphracts forming the spearhead, the conventional armoured cavalry on either side and the light regiments on the extreme right, ready to block outflankers and to pursue fleeing enemy horse. The initial collision would <b>shatter</b> <b>the</b> enemy formation, and then the Germans could be overpowered in the ensuing melee. Failing a cavalry breakthrough, Julian would have to rely on a struggle of attrition on foot, in which superior Roman armour, training and formation discipline would almost inevitably prevail.|$|E
5|$|Luttrell stumbles upon a {{small body}} of water and submerges himself, only to find upon {{surfacing}} that a local Pashtun villager, Mohammad Gulab, has discovered his location. Gulab takes Luttrell into his care, returning to his village, where he attempts to hide Luttrell in his home. Gulab then sends a mountain man to the nearest American air base to alert military forces to Luttrell's location. The Taliban fighters arrive at the village to capture and kill Luttrell, but Gulab and the villagers intervene, threatening to kill the fighters if they harm Luttrell. The fighters leave, but later return to punish the villagers for protecting Luttrell. Gulab and his fellow militia are able to fend off several fighters during the ensuing attack. American forces, arriving via helicopters, <b>shatter</b> <b>the</b> advancing Taliban and, in the process, kill {{the bulk of the}} insurgents with concentrated weaponry fire. The American forces evacuate Luttrell back to base.|$|E

5|$|In May 1958, No.1 Applied Flying Training School began {{equipping}} with Vampire jet trainers at RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia. As RAAF {{pilots were}} now gaining their first exposure to jets elsewhere, No.2 OTU took {{over from the}} fighter squadrons the responsibility of converting trained jet pilots to Sabres. Reflecting its new primary role, it was renamed No.2 (Fighter) Operational Conversion Unit (No.2 OCU) in September 1958, and ceased Vampire courses the same month. Wing Commander Neville McNamara, later Chief of the Air Staff (CAS) and Chief of the Defence Force Staff, served as commanding officer from August 1959 until January 1961. During his tenure, the unit undertook exercises with No.75 Squadron at RAAF Bases Amberley, Townsville and Darwin. Two Sabre pilots from No.2 OCU and one from No.75 Squadron died in separate incidents early in 1960; each had attempted to eject at low level and suffered fatal head injuries from colliding with the aircraft's canopy during the ejection sequence. All RAAF Sabres were grounded until ARDU developed a modification to <b>shatter</b> <b>the</b> canopy immediately before the pilot ejected.|$|E

These moves have become Sub-Zero's trademark since then, being featured in every game that Sub-Zero has appeared in (Mortal Kombat II and subsequent games feature the younger Sub-Zero). Mortal Kombat II added his ground freeze move, and two new Fatalities including the now-famous one where he would freeze and <b>shatter</b> <b>the</b> victim.|$|E
25|$|After resting at Guiguinto, Bulacan from March 29 to 30, 1899, the American {{division}} under General Arthur MacArthur, Jr. {{pushed to}} the suburbs of Malolos by the afternoon of March 30. Malolos fell the next day, on March 31, since the Americans faced only token resistance.

25|$|Gritty and realistic, {{the novel}} was partly {{intended}} to <b>shatter</b> <b>the</b> myth of a noble, obedient Finnish soldier. In Linna's own words, {{he wanted to}} give the Finnish soldier a brain, an organ lacking in earlier depictions—such as Johan Runeberg's The Tales of Ensign Stål where Finnish soldiers are admiringly portrayed with big hearts and little independent intellect. The Unknown Soldier is closely based on Linna's own experiences as a Finnish Army soldier in Infantry Regiment 8 during the Continuation War, but is more or less fictional.|$|E
25|$|The two-day {{battle of}} Wagram was {{particularly}} bloody, mainly {{due to the}} extensive use of artillery on a flat battlefield packed with some 300,000 men. Although Napoleon was the uncontested winner, he failed to secure a complete victory and the Austrian casualties were only slightly greater {{than those of the}} French and allies. Nonetheless, the defeat was serious enough to <b>shatter</b> <b>the</b> morale of the Austrians, who could no longer find the will to continue the struggle. The resulting Treaty of Schönbrunn meant the loss of one sixth of the Austrian Empire's subjects, along with some territories.|$|E
25|$|On {{the eastern}} part of the front, in the Battle of Yunnan-Burma Road, the Chinese 200th Division held up the Japanese for a time around Toungoo, but after its fall the road was open for {{motorised}} troops of the Japanese 56th Division to <b>shatter</b> <b>the</b> Chinese Sixth Army to the east in the Karenni States and advance northward through the Shan States to capture Lashio, outflanking the Allied defensive lines and cutting off the Chinese armies from Yunnan. With the effective collapse of the entire defensive line, there was little choice left other than an overland retreat to India or to Yunnan.|$|E

25|$|Beginning on March 25, the Americans {{began their}} drive to capture Malolos, the Philippine capital at the time, {{hoping that it}} would <b>shatter</b> <b>the</b> morale of the Filipino troops. This was {{achieved}} on March 31, amidst token resistance by about 5,000 Filipinos. The capital had already been transferred to San Isidro, Nueva Ecija, before the debacle, and the main Filipino force, {{under the command of}} General Antonio Luna, had moved to the CalumpitApalit Line. MacArthur, meanwhile, rested with his troops in Malolos to prepare the drive against the CalumpitApalit Line. The Battle of Quingua, which occurred on April 23, signaled {{the beginning of a new}} American offensive. It was one of the flanks in the Filipino line of defense.|$|E
25|$|Gibraltar's first tunnels were {{constructed}} by {{hand in a}} slow, backbreaking but remarkably long-lasting method of excavation. The first task was to fragment the limestone rock. This was done by {{using a variety of}} methods, including gunpowder blasting, fire setting (building a fire against the face of the rock to heat it, then quenching it with cold water to cause it to shatter), quicklime (used to fill boreholes which were then slaked with water, causing it to expand and so shattering the surrounding rock) and hammering in wooden wedges which were expanded by soaking them with water, again causing the rock to <b>shatter.</b> <b>The</b> fragments were then removed with crowbars and sledgehammers.|$|E

25|$|During 1970–71, Esposito {{shattered}} {{the record for}} most goals in a season, finishing with 76. The mark stood until 1982, when Wayne Gretzky scored his 77th, 78th and 79th goals against the Buffalo Sabres on February 24, 1982, at the Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. Esposito was on hand to present the game puck to Gretzky. Esposito also set the single-season point-scoring record in 1971 with 152, a mark later raised by Gretzky to 215. Only three others have reached the 150 point plateau — Mario Lemieux 199, Steve Yzerman 155 and Bernie Nicholls 150 — and only Gretzky, Lemieux, Brett Hull, Teemu Selänne and Alexander Mogilny have matched or bettered Esposito's 76 goals in a season. The 1970 season also saw Esposito <b>shatter</b> <b>the</b> single season mark for shots on goal, tallying 550. Only one other player has come within 100 shots of this record, Alexander Ovechkin in 2008–09, in a season that was four games longer than when it was set.|$|E
25|$|At {{this time}} the Franks, hearing that both the Goths and Romans had {{suffered}} severely by the war... forgetting for the moment their oaths and treaties... (for this nation in matters of trust is the most treacherous in the world), they straightway gathered {{to the number of}} one hundred thousand under the leadership of Theudebert I and marched into Italy: they had a small body of cavalry about their leader, and these were the only ones armed with spears, while all the rest were foot soldiers having neither bows nor spears, but each man carried a sword and shield and one axe. Now the iron head of this weapon was thick and exceedingly sharp on both sides, while the wooden handle was very short. And they are accustomed always to throw these axes at a signal in the first charge and thus to <b>shatter</b> <b>the</b> shields of the enemy and kill the men.|$|E
25|$|Jon convinces Mance {{that he is}} a deserter {{from the}} Night's Watch and learns that the Others are driving the wildlings south towards the Wall. Jon and his captor Ygritte also begin a sexual relationship. Mance seeks the legendary Horn of Winter to <b>shatter</b> <b>the</b> Wall. After {{climbing}} the Wall, the wildlings press Jon to murder a homeless man. When Jon refuses, the wildlings turn on him but Jon, with the assistance of Bran's direwolf Summer (Bran and company are hiding in a nearby abandoned tower), kills many of the wildlings and escapes to Castle Black. The approaching wildling army reaches Castle Black and assaults the Wall; but Jon takes command of the defenses and repels several assaults, during which Ygritte is slain. After that, Janos Slynt and Alliser Thorne imprison Jon for treachery and subsequently send him north of the Wall to kill Mance under a pretense of parley. As Jon is talking with Mance in the wildling camp, the army of King Stannis arrives, routing the Wildlings, and Mance is imprisoned. Melisandre believes the wildling invasion to portend the return of the Great Other, the sworn foe of her god R'hllor. Stannis offers to legitimize Jon and make him Lord of Winterfell in exchange for his support, but when his direwolf Ghost unexpectedly returns, Jon decides to decline Stannis' offer. Before he can inform Stannis, Jon is chosen by the Night's Watch as its new Lord Commander.|$|E
