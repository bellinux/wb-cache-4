5|$|Although he {{is mainly}} {{associated}} with the Royal Ballet, MacMillan frequently considered himself an outsider there and felt driven {{to work with other}} companies throughout his career as choreographer. His creations for the Stuttgart Ballet and the Deutsche Opera ballet include <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>most</b> frequently revived works.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1920s, Ornstein left New York {{to accept}} a {{teaching}} post at the Philadelphia Musical Academy, later part of the University of the Arts. During this period, he wrote <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>most</b> important work, including the Piano Concerto, commissioned by the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1925. Two years later, he produced his Piano Quintet. An epic tonal work marked by an adventurous use of dissonance and complex rhythmic arrangements, it is recognized as a masterpiece of the genre.|$|E
5|$|On 30 May 2011, Essentials & Rarities, double CD set, was {{released}}. This was {{the last}} Jarre work to be released by Disques Dreyfus. The Essentials disc is a compilation of <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>most</b> famous works. The Rarities disc includes pieces recorded in the {{years prior to the}} release of Oxygène. After this release, Jarre recovered sole intellectual property rights over his work, which had previously been owned by Francis Dreyfus Music.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} few years Mendelssohn {{travelled}} widely, including making his first visit to England in 1829, and also visiting amongst other places Vienna, Florence, Milan, Rome and Naples, in all of which he met with local and visiting musicians and artists. These years proved the germination for <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>most</b> famous works, including the Hebrides Overture and the Scottish and Italian symphonies.|$|E
5|$|While in Ferrara, Josquin wrote <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>most</b> famous compositions, {{including}} the austere, Savonarola-influenced Miserere, which {{became one of}} the most widely distributed motets of the 16th century; the utterly contrasting, virtuoso motet Virgo salutiferi; and possibly the Missa Hercules Dux Ferrariae, which is written on a cantus firmus derived from the musical letters in the Duke's name, a technique known as soggetto cavato.|$|E
5|$|During {{his later}} {{creative}} years, Rodin's work turned increasingly toward the female form, and themes of more overt masculinity and femininity. He concentrated on small dance studies, and produced numerous erotic drawings, sketched {{in a loose}} way, without taking his pencil from the paper or {{his eyes from the}} model. Rodin met American dancer Isadora Duncan in 1900, attempted to seduce her, and the next year sketched studies of her and her students. In July 1906, Rodin was also enchanted by dancers from the Royal Ballet of Cambodia, and produced <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>most</b> famous drawings from the experience.|$|E
5000|$|Dmitri Shostakovich {{incorporated}} {{elements of}} Jewish music in <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> compositions. <b>Most</b> notable are the song cycle From Jewish Folk Poetry, and the 13th symphony, titled Babi Yar.|$|R
25|$|In 1889, at the Exposition Universelle in Paris, Debussy {{first heard}} Javanese gamelan music. He {{incorporated}} gamelan scales, melodies, rhythms, and ensemble textures into <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> compositions, <b>most</b> notably Pagodes from his piano collection Estampes.|$|R
5000|$|Frank Lloyd Wright used {{passive solar}} {{principles}} in <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> designs, <b>most</b> {{notably in the}} Jacobs House, built in 1944 in Wisconsin, which was {{also known as the}} [...] "Solar Hemicycle" [...] or [...] "Solar Hemicyclo." ...|$|R
5|$|Fauré's new {{position}} left him better off financially. However, while he also {{became much more}} widely known as a composer, running the Conservatoire left him with no more time for composition than when he was struggling {{to earn a living}} as an organist and piano teacher. As soon as the working year was over, in the last days of July, he would leave Paris and spend the two months until early October in a hotel, usually by one of the Swiss lakes, to concentrate on composition. His works from this period include his lyric opera, Pénélope (1913), and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>most</b> characteristic later songs (e.g., the cycle La chanson d'Ève, Op. 95, completed in 1910) and piano pieces (Nocturnes Nos. 9–11; Barcarolles Nos. 7–11, written between 1906 and 1914).|$|E
5|$|Gaudí {{devoted his}} life entirely to his profession, {{remaining}} single. He {{is known to have}} been attracted to only one woman—Josefa Moreu, teacher at the Mataró Cooperative, in 1884—but this was not reciprocated. Thereafter Gaudí took refuge in the profound spiritual peace his Catholic faith offered him. Gaudí is often depicted as unsociable and unpleasant, a man of gruff reactions and arrogant gestures. However, those who were close to him described him as friendly and polite, pleasant to talk to and faithful to friends. Among these, his patrons Eusebi Güell and the bishop of Vic, Josep Torras i Bages, stand out, as well as the writers Joan Maragall and Jacint Verdaguer, the physician Pere Santaló and <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>most</b> faithful collaborators, such as Francesc Berenguer and Llorenç Matamala.|$|E
5|$|Gaveston's first exile {{was to be}} a short one. In early July 1307, Edward I {{fell ill}} while once more campaigning in the north, and lay dying at Burgh by Sands near the Scottish border. According to one chronicle, he {{gathered}} <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>most</b> trusted men around him, including Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln; Guy de Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick; and Aymer de Valence, soon to be Earl of Pembroke. Edward entrusted the magnates with the care of his son, and instructed them particularly to prevent the return of Piers Gaveston from exile. Nevertheless, when the King died on 7 July, one of Edward II's first acts as king was to recall his friend. Gaveston returned almost immediately, and the two were reunited by early August.|$|E

5|$|Several of Josquin's masses {{feature the}} {{paraphrase}} technique, and they include <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>most</b> famous work including the great Missa Gaudeamus. The relatively early Missa Ave maris stella, which probably dates from {{his years in}} the Sistine Chapel choir, paraphrases the Marian antiphon of the same name; {{it is also one}} of his shortest masses. The late Missa de Beata Virgine paraphrases plainchants in praise of the Virgin Mary; it is a Lady Mass, a votive mass for Saturday performance, and was his most popular mass in the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|Shaw was {{particularly}} {{known for his}} performances in productions of Shakespeare plays which were considered daring and ahead of their time. In 1966, he joined the Royal Shakespeare Company, where he remained for a decade and delivered <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>most</b> acclaimed performances. He also wrote several poems and a novel, The Christening, in 1975. He is also known for his brief but important performance in Return of the Jedi, the original third installment in the Star Wars franchise, in which he portrayed an unmasked and redeemed Anakin Skywalker (formerly Darth Vader), and his ghost in the original version of the film.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg {{had been}} {{the leader of the}} Albanians for over a decade and had seen many {{victories}} over Ottoman arms. However, after his loss at Berat in 1455 at the hands of Isak bey, Skanderbeg was betrayed by <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>most</b> trusted officers, among them Moisi Arianit Golemi. Golemi returned the next year with an Ottoman force under his command, but was defeated at the Battle of Oranik and rejoined Skanderbeg's army. Later, the dissatisfied Hamza Kastrioti betrayed Skanderbeg and was offered joint-command with Isak bey over a second Ottoman invasion force.|$|E

50|$|The Clavier-Übung III, {{sometimes}} referred to as the German Organ Mass, is a collection of compositions for organ by Johann Sebastian Bach, started in 1735-36 and published in 1739. It is considered Bach's most significant and extensive work for organ, containing <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> musically <b>most</b> complex and technically most demanding compositions for that instrument.|$|R
5|$|Upon {{moving in}} with Borthwick in the winter 1911, Wright resumed work on his {{architectural}} projects, but he struggled to secure commissions because of the ongoing negative publicity over his affair with Borthwick (whose ex-husband, Edwin Cheney, maintained main custody of their son and daughter). However, Wright did produce <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>most</b> acclaimed works during this time period, including the Midway Gardens in Chicago and the Avery Coonley Playhouse in Riverside. He also indulged his hobby for collecting Japanese art, and quickly became a renowned authority. Borthwick translated four works from Swedish difference feminist Ellen Key.|$|E
5|$|Born in Travnik in Austrian-occupied Bosnia, Andrić {{attended}} {{high school}} in Sarajevo, where he became {{an active member of}} several South Slav national youth organizations. Following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in June 1914, Andrić was arrested and imprisoned by the Austro-Hungarian police, who suspected his involvement in the plot. As the authorities were unable to build a strong case against him, he spent much of the war under house arrest, only being released following a general amnesty for such cases in July 1917. After the war, he studied South Slavic history and literature at universities in Zagreb and Graz, eventually attaining his Ph.D in Graz in 1924. He worked in the diplomatic service of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia from 1920–1923 and again from 1924–1941. In 1939, he became Yugoslavia's ambassador to Germany, but his tenure ended in April 1941 with the German-led invasion of his country. Shortly after the invasion, Andrić returned to German-occupied Belgrade. He lived quietly in a friend's apartment for the duration of World War II, in conditions that some biographers liken to house arrest, and wrote <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>most</b> important works, including Na Drini ćuprija (The Bridge on the Drina).|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s, South Korea's film {{industry}} {{was at a}} low point due to government censorship and underfunding. Because of the poor state of the local {{film industry}}, cinema attendance in South Korea had dropped drastically since its high-point in the 1960s. Kim Ki-young, however, working independently in B-movie-like genre films, began to produce <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>most</b> innovative and personal works at this time. Kim fully regained his auteurist spirit with Woman of Fire (1971), the second of his Housemaid trilogy. The use of color, particularly reds and blues to express the anxiety and desires of the film's characters, distinguished this film from the original Housemaids dark, shadowy black-and-white photography. For this film, Kim was named Best Director at the Blue Dragon Film Awards and actress Youn Yuh-jung was given Special Mention for Best Actress at the Festival de Cine de Sitges. Not only popular with the critics, Kim's independently produced films were box-office successes during this era in which most films were harmed through heavy governmental interference. In 1972 Kim's Insect Woman was the only film to sell more than 100,000 tickets in Seoul and won Kim the Best Director prize at the Baeksang Arts Awards in 1973.|$|E
50|$|While Calloway {{had always}} done some drawing, his {{prolific}} output as an artist dates {{from the time he}} took an art class in the 1980s. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> drawings, <b>most</b> <b>of</b> which portray the rural Southern United States <b>of</b> <b>his</b> youth, were part of an autumn 2008 exhibit at the American Visionary Art Museum in Baltimore, Maryland.|$|R
50|$|He {{married in}} 1664, and had many children. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sons, <b>most</b> famously Jean-Baptiste Hertel de Rouville, {{followed}} him into military service, and the name Hertel became notorious in the English colonies because of their exploits. In 1716, {{after many years of}} requests by New France's governors on his behalf, he was elevated to local nobility.|$|R
50|$|<b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bitterest and <b>most</b> earnest pictures, {{the fruit}} of a visit to London, {{appeared}} in L'Illustration. He also illustrated Honoré de Balzac's novels, and Eugène Sue's Wandering Jew.|$|R
5|$|In November 1956, Presley {{made his}} film debut in Love Me Tender. In 1958, {{he was drafted}} into {{military}} service. He resumed his recording career two years later, producing <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>most</b> commercially successful work before devoting much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and their accompanying soundtrack albums, {{most of which were}} critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed televised comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley featured in the first globally broadcast concert via satellite, Aloha from Hawaii. On August 16, 1977, he suffered a heart attack in his Graceland estate, and died as a result. His death came in the wake of many years of prescription drug abuse.|$|E
5|$|Other {{structures}} {{designed by}} Cutter include the Spokane Club, Washington Water Power Substation, Monroe Street Bridge (featured {{in the city}} seal), Central Steam Plant, and the Davenport Hotel. Built in renaissance and Spanish Revival style, the Davenport Hotel cost two million dollars to complete, and included new technologies {{at the time of}} its opening in September 1914, such as chilled water, elevators, and air cooling. In contemporary times, one of the foremost and influential architects in the city has been Warren C. Heylman, who helped give the city a great breadth of mid-century architecture. Heylman's career was most prolific during the 1960s and 1970s where his main body of work was done in the modernist style, designing numerous residential houses, apartment buildings, and architectural embellishments. <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>most</b> noteworthy works in Spokane include The Parkade, Spokane International Airport, Spokane Regional Health Building, and the Burlington Northern Latah Creek Bridge over Hangman Valley.|$|E
5|$|The local {{population}} remained faithful to Skanderbeg {{and did not}} reveal his whereabouts. Isak bey and Hamza grew confident that Skanderbeg had been defeated and had thus began to withdraw. When he judged the time right, Skanderbeg gave the signal for the army, which had up until then been in separate groups, to assemble without being seen by the Ottomans. The army gathered by the hills at Tumenishta – as the weakest point in the Ottoman camp was in this direction – and on 2 September 1457, it was split again into three groups to assault the Ottoman camp. With <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>most</b> trusted men, he climbed to a high peak to scout on the Ottoman camp {{and saw that the}} Ottomans were resting. He descended with his chosen band to eliminate any watching guards, but one saw Skanderbeg and fled into the camp yelling that Skanderbeg had arrived. In order to maintain the surprise, Skanderbeg ordered his men to get ready for battle.|$|E
50|$|Rehnquist {{remained}} {{skeptical about}} the Court's Equal Protection Clause jurisprudence; <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> opinions <b>most</b> favorable to equality resulted from statutory rather than constitutional interpretation. For example, in Meritor Savings Bank v.
