The <b>sun</b> <b>tracking</b> <b>systems</b> effect on the PV system performances is improved by using the hourly data collected over 18 Â days for different seasonal sky conditions. The daily cumulative electrical energy produced by the different systems have been quantified separately for each sky state and the corresponding electrical gains have then been compared to those experienced with two traditional fixed photovoltaic systems. It is found that for a completely clear day, the highest obtained gains are those related to the two-axis sun tracker systems, which decrease gradually from the inclined to the vertical rotating axis when the same optimum slope is applied and from the seasonal to the yearly optimum slope if the same rotating axis is considered. On the other hand, for the partially clear days, the gain amounts are mainly dependant on the clearness index and on the seasonal variation of day length values. For a completely cloudy day, the results show that all considered systems produced closely the same electrical energy and the horizontal position of the photovoltaic panel presented the best performance. <b>Sun</b> <b>tracking</b> Photovoltaic Gain Solar irradiation...|$|R

40|$|According {{to market}} economy, the {{increasing}} worldwide demand for energy, forces a continuous rise {{on the price}} of fossil combustibles. In fact, it is expected in the near future, that the demand for energy will grow faster than the finding out of new available fossil resources (Khan et al., 2007). This market behaviour brings a positive challenge to the scientific community as more funds are allocated for the research and development of new alternatives to the usual main energetic sources (fossil combustibles). In this context we have seen, in the last decades, to a concentrated focus on renewable energy research. Among these renewable energetic sources, the international scientific community has devoted intense efforts to wind, solar photovoltaic and biomass. Some investigations and hardware developments on wave energy have been led by Great Britain and Portugal (Wave-Energy-Centre). In this paper an intelligent sun-tracking system for efficiency maximization referring photovoltaic energy production is developed. Nowadays photovoltaic energy has a low efficiency ratio concerning the complete distribution chain from production to consumption (ca. 12 %). In optimized environments (materials, electric inverters, <b>tracking</b> <b>systems,</b> etc) an input of 1000 W of solar incident energy can bring ca. 190 W in electricity (efficiency of 19 %). This low performance ratio implies big Earth surface consumption when it is intended to install industrial photovoltaic units with significant production impact (50 MW – 100 MW). Today it is being built in south Portugal a photovoltaic plant with 64 MW production capacity which occupies an huge area of ca. 400 ha (4 Km 2). The more relevant side effect of the low efficiency of photovoltaic systems is its poor competition related to traditional combustibles in both economical and financial aspects. Owing to changes in the solar radiation energy and in the cell operating temperature, the output power of a solar array is not constant at all times. Consequently, a maximum solar power tracking controller is always needed in any scheme with solar cell arrays to ensure maximum utilization. Therefore, works to solve the problems on maximum power point (MPP) tracking have always been a hot topic for photovoltaic array utilization systems. A logical MPP tracking search algorithm using normalized current, voltage and power at the work points, that corresponds to the maximum power point values for different operating conditions was early tested (Atlas, 1992), (Atlas, 1996). A on-line controller to track the MPPs under changing illumination was described in (Hua & Lin, 2003). An optimization approach using fuzzy was given in (Benlarbi et al., 2004) for PV water pumping <b>systems.</b> Other MPP <b>tracking</b> controllers can be found in (Hua & Lin, 2004) and (Chen et al., 2004). This paper focuses on the optimization of the electric energy production by photovoltaic cells through the development of an intelligent sun-tracking <b>system.</b> The developed <b>tracking</b> <b>system</b> is innovative in relation to the usual <b>sun</b> <b>tracking</b> <b>systems</b> available in the market. The usual available solutions for <b>tracking</b> <b>systems</b> rely on the knowledge of the geographical position of the solar panel on the earth surface. With this knowledge it is possible to know the relative position of the sun, on a time basis, according to the well known solar tables (Solardat). Modern solutions incorporate a GPS system to calculate the position of the solar panel on the Earth surface. The orientations to be followed by the photovoltaic panel, on a regular time-base, are then pre-programmed, on an open loop approach. There are significant efforts on the optimization of <b>sun</b> <b>tracking</b> <b>systems</b> as it is documented by several registered international patents. These solutions are based either on the above described principle either on the quantification of the received solar energy, either on the maximization of the solar incident radiation through the use of light concentration lens or mirrors (Biee & Chace, 2009), (Rubio et al., 2007). The solution developed in this paper is innovative related to the above referred approaches as this system is autonomous regarding the information needed to process the optimal orientation and it is intelligent {{in a way that it}} monitors, on a real-time base, the photovoltaic energy production and it avoids systematic failures coming from changes on the assumed blind values (position, initial infrastructure orientation, cleanness of the photovoltaic cells, etc.) ...|$|R

40|$|High level optical {{concentration}} {{systems can}} possibly offer {{a viable alternative}} to flat panel photovoltaic because large powers can be produced with relatively small amount of photovoltaic cells. At the same time the widespread application of high concentrator systems would not be hindered by the limited amount of silicon available for the flat panel market, since concentration permits the assessment of electronic grade silicon for the cells, and the system production costs would significantly gain from scale law effects. Mirror concentrators, while used nowadays mostly for thermal applications, can be usefully employed for photovoltaic once the peculiar requirements of concentrator systems have been correctly taken into account. Concentration ratios higher than 50 X can be attained, for KW’s scale power plants, by the use of composite mirrors array equipped with precise two axis <b>sun</b> <b>tracking</b> <b>systems.</b> A set of flat mirror is mounted on a pseudo-parabolic frame allowing for an highly scalable design.

Specially designed cells, based on a design similar to the one sun cell, can be employed on concentrator systems with a significant cost reduction 3 while the cooling can be based on miniaturized heat exchanger developed on silicon substrates with micromachining techniques 5. Moreover the proper selection, by the use of dichroic coatings on the secondary concentrator, of the wavelength reaching the cells allows to significantly improve the cell conversion efficiency and the employable concentration ratios 4. The remaining spectrum part can be sent on a separate receiver, like a different cell array of a thermal receiver. We present here an example of a small concentrator system designed and produced along these lines. The system is actually operational at the University of Ferrara and is routinely used for research purposes on the concentration subject...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an electromechanical, biaxial-type {{concentrated}} solar <b>tracking</b> <b>system</b> {{was designed}} for solar-thermal applications. In our <b>tracking</b> <b>system,</b> the sunlight was concentrated by the microstructure of Fresnel lens to the heating head of the Stirling engine and two solar cells were installed to provide the power for <b>tracking</b> <b>system</b> operation. In order to obtain the maximum <b>sun</b> power, the <b>tracking</b> <b>system</b> traces the <b>sun</b> with the altitude-azimuth biaxial tracing method and accurately maintains the sun’s radiation perpendicular to {{the plane of the}} heating head. The results indicated that the position of heating head is an important factor for power collection. If the sunlight can be concentrated to completely cover the heating head with small heat loss, we can obtain the maximum temperature of the heating head of the Stirling engine. Therefore, the temperature of heating head can be higher than 1000 °C in our experiment on a sunny day. Moreover, the results also revealed that the temperature decrease of the heating head is less than the power decrease of solar irradiation because of the latent heat of copper and the small heat loss from the heating head...|$|R
40|$|Solar {{collector}} technologies {{operate with}} better performance when the Sun beam direction is normal to the capturing surface, {{and for that}} to happen despite the relative movement of the <b>Sun,</b> solar <b>tracking</b> <b>systems</b> are used, therefore, there are rules and standards that need minimum accuracy for these <b>tracking</b> <b>systems</b> to be used in solar collectors’ evaluation. Obtaining accuracy is not an easy job, hence in this document the design, construction and characterization of a sensor based on a visual system that finds the relative azimuth error and height of the solar surface of interest, is presented. With these characteristics, the sensor {{can be used as a}} reference in control systems and their evaluation. The proposed sensor is based on a microcontroller with a real-time clock, inertial measurement sensors, geolocation and a vision sensor, that obtains the angle of incidence from the sunrays’ direction as well as the tilt and sensor position. The sensor’s characterization proved how a measurement of a focus error or a Sun position can be made, with an accuracy of 0. 0426 ° and an uncertainty of 0. 986 %, which can be modified to reach an accuracy under 0. 01 °. The validation of this sensor was determined showing the focus error on one of the best commercial solar <b>tracking</b> <b>systems,</b> a Kipp & Zonen SOLYS 2. To conclude, the solar tracking sensor based on a vision system meets the Sun detection requirements and components that meet the accuracy conditions to be used in solar <b>tracking</b> <b>systems</b> and their evaluation or, as a tracking and orientation tool, on photovoltaic installations and solar collectors...|$|R
