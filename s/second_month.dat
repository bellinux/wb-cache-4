5|$|The first {{forecast}} for the 2005 season {{was produced by}} the Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) in the <b>second</b> <b>month</b> of the year. In their report, the organization cited a list of analog years – 1952, 1957, 1985, 1991, and 1993 – with similar oceanic and atmospheric patterns. An overall total of 17 tropical storms, 10 hurricanes, and 7 major hurricanes was forecast, above the average. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), meanwhile, released their seasonal outlook on May16, predicting 11 to 15 named storms, 6 to 8 hurricanes, and 2 to 4 major hurricanes. The organization noted that when the Atlantic basin was busier than average, as expected in 2005, the eastern Pacific generally saw lesser activity. That same day, NOAA issued a {{forecast for}} activity across the central Pacific, expecting 2 to 3 tropical cyclones to occur across the basin. A normal season averaged 4 to 5 tropical cyclones, including 1 hurricane. A near-normal El Niño–Southern Oscillation existed across the equatorial Pacific throughout 2005, which indicated conditions generally less conducive for activity there.|$|E

Cisak was {{recalled}} by Burnley after his loan expired and York replaced him with Peterborough United's former Austria under-21 international goalkeeper Bobby Olejnik, who joined on loan {{for the rest of}} the season. After De Girolamo's loan expired Sheffield United wanted to strengthen their striking options before considering letting him return to York. Morris' loan was extended for a <b>second</b> <b>month</b> after making four substitute appearances for York, and Parslow had his loan at Grimsby extended to the end of the season. York were beaten 1–0 away to league leaders Wycombe and Olejnik made a number of saves on his debut to keep the team in the match. Zubar's loan was extended until the end of the season ahead of him starting a four-match suspension, before Jarvis was loaned to Conference Premier club Aldershot Town {{for the rest of the}} season having not played for York since October 2014.|$|E
5|$|Coulson scored after 15 {{seconds to}} give York the lead {{at home to}} league leaders Oxford United, and with further goals from Chambers and Patrick McLaughlin the team {{went on to win}} 3–1.

Walker's {{equaliser}} in the fifth minute of stoppage time secured a 2–2 draw at home to Chesterfield. There had been three goals scored in a five-minute period in the first half; Chesterfield opened the scoring through Sam Hird and Coulson equalised for York before Craig Westcarr restored the visitors' lead. York drew their next match 1–1 away to Exeter City, having taken the lead through Coulson in the 52nd minute before the home team equalised when John O'Flynn scored in the 83rd minute. The team's first away defeat of the season came with a 3–1 defeat away to Burton Albion; after McLaughlin gave York a ninth-minute lead, Burton went on to win with goals from Lee Bell, Calvin Zola and Matt Paterson.

5|$|Critchell {{signed a}} two-year {{contract}} with newly relegated Conference Premier side Wrexham on 24 June 2008. He made his debut in a 2–0 victory over Oxford United, {{where he played}} in right midfield. After making a further appearance for Wrexham he suffered from an ankle injury during a training session. He underwent surgery on this ankle in October, which had been delayed due to illness. After recovering from this injury four months later, {{he said he was}} looking to be loaned out to help improve his first-team chances at Wrexham. He eventually joined fellow Conference Premier side York City on a one-month loan on 5 January 2009. He was due to make his debut a day later against former club Weymouth, but the match was postponed. He eventually made his first appearance after playing in the 2–1 victory over Oxford on 13 January {{in the second round of}} the FA Trophy. This was followed by his league debut on 17 January in a 3–0 victory over Lewes. The loan was extended for a <b>second</b> <b>month</b> on 4 February and finished his time at York with 11 appearances.|$|E
5|$|Critchell's loan at York was {{extended}} for a <b>second</b> <b>month,</b> with the fitness of several York defenders in doubt. York were beaten 1–0 away by Mansfield, {{courtesy of a}} Robert Duffy penalty, in the teams' fourth encounter of the season. A 13–12 penalty shoot-out victory over Kidderminster followed a 1–1 extra time draw in an FA Trophy replay; in normal time, McBreen scored a header from a corner delivered by Simon Rusk before the away team equalised shortly after through Justin Richards. A new record for the most consecutive penalties scored in a shoot-out was set, at 25. McBreen {{was reported to have}} signed for North Queensland Fury of the A-League, although the transfer had yet to be confirmed by York. It was confirmed that he would join the Fury for the start of 2009–10 in August 2009. Former Wrexham defender Shaun Pejic signed after a successful trial at the club. York beat Conference South team Havant & Waterlooville 2–0 at home in the fourth round of the FA Trophy to secure a place in the semi-final, with both goals scored by McBreen. This was followed by a 2–0 away defeat to Rushden in the league. York's first league victory in a month was a 2–0 home win over Weymouth, who were forced to play a weakened team due to their financial situation, and Brodie scored headers in each half.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to another}} lockout, the 2012–13 season was delayed until January 2013. The Sedins this time {{remained}} in Canada, as {{they decided that}} would return to Modo only if the entire season again wound up cancelled. In the <b>second</b> <b>month</b> of the season, Henrik recorded his 757th point, surpassing Markus Näslund as the Canucks' all-time leading scorer. Two months later, Daniel also passed Näslund, scoring a goal and an assist in a 3–1 win against the Chicago Blackhawks, ranking the Sedins first and second in team history. Playing in just 47 games due to the lockout-shortened season, Daniel recorded 12 goals and 40 points. He ranked second in team scoring behind Henrik's 45 points. In the playoffs, he added three assists in a four-game defeat to the San Jose Sharks. The series ended on a shorthanded goal due to a penalty assessed to Daniel in overtime. In pursuit of a loose puck in the defensive zone, Daniel bodychecked Sharks forward Tommy Wingels into the boards, resulting in a boarding penalty. The call would later {{be the subject of}} controversy as it was believed by many in the media, such as National Post journalist Cam Cole, as well as teammates, such as Henrik, that Daniel had made contact with Wingels shoulder-to-shoulder, which according to NHL rules, should not result in a boarding penalty.|$|E

Despite this, he was forced further down Sunderland's pecking order after they signed Mart Poom on loan from Derby County and after considering handing in a transfer request he joined Third Division club Darlington on a one-month loan on 22 November 2002. He made three appearances before returning to Sunderland in December. He played for Sunderland in a friendly against Hull City {{for the opening of}} their new ground, the KC Stadium, which made him the first away goalkeeper at the ground, while also being the last to play at Hull's former ground, Boothferry Park. This was his final appearance for Darlington in a 1–0 victory over Hull, during which he denied Stuart Elliott from scoring on three occasions. He joined Third Division club York City on 24 January 2003 on a one-month loan after goalkeeper Alan Fettis left to join Hull, who Ingham made his debut against a day later in a 0–0 away draw. His loan at York was extended for second and third months in February and March 2003 and he finished the spell, in which he performed well, with 17 appearances.|$|E
5|$|Midfielder Michael Collins joined on a one-month {{loan from}} Oxford, as {{cover for the}} injured Nolan and Summerfield.

However, Mark Roberts and Barry Corr scored for Cambridge in the last 19 minutes, and the match {{finished}} a 2–2 draw. York knocked League One team Doncaster Rovers out of the Football League Trophy {{in the second round}} with a 2–0 home win. Oliver gave York an early lead with a header into the bottom corner from an Anthony Straker cross, and he doubled the lead early into the second half; after dispossessing Aaron Taylor-Sinclair he lifted the ball over the advancing goalkeeper, Thorsten Stuckmann, before hitting the ball into an empty net. York ended Luton Town's four-match winning streak with a 1–1 away draw; Lowe scored late into the first half with a shot into the top of the goal, before Luton equalised in the second half from a Cameron McGeehan penalty. Turner's loan was extended for a <b>second</b> <b>month.</b> York were beaten 3–1 away by Barnet, who had been on a three-match losing streak. After going behind to John Akinde's goal, Coulson equalised for York in the 80th minute with a drilled shot, but goals in the last 10 minutes from Michael Gash and Josh Clarke secured a win for the home team.|$|E
5|$|Oliver {{scored a}} tap-in to give York a 14th-minute lead {{at home to}} Dagenham & Redbridge, before the away team {{equalised}} through Ashley Hemmings later in the first half.

York lost 3–1 at home to AFC Wimbledon, who took the lead in the first half through Ade Azeez before Oliver equalised with a bicycle kick in the 60th minute. Lyle Taylor and Tom Elliott scored later in the second half to secure AFC Wimbledon's first successive win of 2015. Wilcox and his assistant John Schofield were sacked with York 21st in the table after a run of nine matches without a win. First-team coach Richard Cresswell took over as caretaker manager, assisted by youth-team coach Jonathan Greening and goalkeeping coach Andy Leaning. Middlesbrough midfielder Bryn Morris, an England youth international, was signed on a one-month loan, and Collins' loan was extended for a <b>second</b> <b>month.</b> Cresswell's first match in charge was a 1–0 away defeat to Crawley Town, who scored in the 86th minute with a Simon Walton penalty.|$|E

40|$|Background: Some {{angiotensin}} converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have previously {{been shown to be}} effective in migraine prophylaxis. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether Enalapril is effective in migraine prophylaxis. Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, the effects of 10 mg Enalapril given daily were compared with those of matched placebo in 40 migraineurs for 2 months. Response to treatment was assessed at 0, 1, and 2 months after the start of intervention according to headache parameters like frequency, severity, and duration. This trial is registered with Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT), number IRCT 138711011570 N 1. Results: A significant effect on reducing migraine attack more than 50 % at first and <b>second</b> <b>months</b> (P= 0. 016) occurred in Enalapril group. Indeed, at the first and <b>second</b> <b>months</b> of treatment, the severities (P= 0. 000 and P= 0. 000) and duration (P= 0. 037 and 0. 003) in the Enalapril treated group were significantly lower than in the placebo group. Conclusion: Enalapril may be effective in migraine prophylaxis according to its effect in decreasing the frequency, severity, and duration of headaches. The results support the previous suggestions on usage of ACE inhibitors in migraine prophylaxis...|$|R
5|$|On {{his return}} to Sheffield Wednesday in May 2005, Foster was {{released}} and later joined League Two side Lincoln City on a one-year contract ahead of the 2005–06 season. Foster made his debut for Lincoln in the club's {{first game of the}} season, a 2–1 defeat to Notts County. However, he failed to hold down a first-team place and had to wait a month to make another appearance for the club – coming on as a 73rd-minute substitute in Lincoln's 2–0 win against Stockport County. However, he was unable to string a series of appearances together throughout the campaign, and made 17 appearances, scoring once in a 5–0 win against Grimsby Town on 25 March 2006. Despite a lack of first-team appearances, Foster signed an extended one-year contract {{at the end of the}} season. However, Foster did not feature again for Lincoln during the 2006–07 campaign and after training with York City, he joined the Conference National team on a one-month emergency loan on 5 October 2006 due to injuries to defenders, making his debut for the club the following day in a 1–0 win against Aldershot Town. This loan deal was extended for a <b>second</b> <b>month</b> in November, but after Foster suffered an ankle injury during the last week of the loan, he returned to his parent club in December. He made his last appearance for York in the club's 1–0 loss to League One side Bristol City in the FA Cup first round. He made seven appearances for York during a two-month loan spell with the club.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>second</b> <b>month</b> of the 2010–11 season, Lucic {{recorded}} a natural hat-trick on November 18, 2010, during a 4–0 {{win over the}} Florida Panthers. Later in the campaign, he was fined $3,500 by the NHL for his actions during a game against Atlanta on December 23. After Lucic was hit by opposing defenceman Freddy Meyer, teammate Andrew Ference engaged Meyer in a fight. In the ensuing scrum, Lucic punched Meyer as the two were being restrained by referees, resulting in a match penalty. Three days following the game, Lucic received a $2,500 fine for his punch and an additional $1,000 for an obscene gesture he had made to players on the Thrashers' bench immediately afterwards. In January 2011, he missed three games with a shoulder injury. Lucic completed {{the season with a}} career-high 30 goals, 32 assists and 62 points in 79 games. He led the Bruins in goal-scoring while tying for the points lead with centre David Krejčí. Entering the 2011 playoffs as the third seed in the East, the Bruins eliminated the Montreal Canadiens, Philadelphia Flyers and Tampa Bay Lightning in the first three rounds, en route to the Stanley Cup Finals against Vancouver. Although Lucic scored below his regular-season pace during the post-season with 12 points (five goals and seven assists) in 25 games, he helped the Bruins to their first Stanley Cup since 1972, as the team defeated the Canucks in Game 7 of the Finals. It was later reported that Lucic was playing through a couple of injuries during the playoffs. During the Eastern Conference Finals, he suffered a broken toe after blocking a shot from teammate Tyler Seguin during practice. He also struggled with a sinus infection, which {{was part of a larger}} problem in his right nostril that traced back to the end of the 2009–10 season and caused improper breathing. Lucic underwent surgery in the off-season to repair the sinus.|$|E

His competitive return was in a 3–3 draw against Cardiff, where he came on as a substitute for Dean Morgan on 82 minutes. He completed 2005–06 with 25 appearances and scored two goals, when Luton finished 10th in the Championship. Following the conclusion of the season, he signed a new one-year contract in June 2006. He joined League One club Chesterfield on a one-month loan on 12 January 2007, making his debut the following day in a 1–0 away victory over Rotherham United, in which he forced goalkeeper Neil Cutler into making a good save. Chesterfield were given the lead by Holmes in a match away to Huddersfield Town with a header from a Kyle Critchell cross, which eventually finished a 1–1 draw. The loan was extended for a <b>second</b> <b>month</b> on 8 February 2007, and Holmes said he would consider signing for the club permanently when the loan expired. He eventually finished his spell at Chesterfield with 10 appearances and scored one goal. He joined Lincoln City of League Two on loan until the end of 2006–07 on 22 March 2007.
