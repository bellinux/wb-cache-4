50|$|<b>Sultamicillin</b> is {{a mutual}} prodrug of {{ampicillin}} and sulbactam. Ampicillin, a semi-synthetic orally active broad spectrum antibiotic, is linked via a methylene {{group with a}} beta-lactamase inhibitor. <b>Sultamicillin</b> is chemically oxymethyl penicillinate sulfone ester of ampicillin.|$|E
50|$|After absorption, <b>sultamicillin</b> {{releases}} ampicillin and sulbactam {{into the}} system, {{so all the}} antibacterial efficacy of <b>sultamicillin</b> is due to ampicillin and sulbactam. Ampicillin exerts antibacterial activity against sensitive organisms by inhibiting biosynthesis of cell wall mucopeptide where as sulbactam irreversibly inhibits most important beta-lactamases that occur in resistant strains.|$|E
50|$|The {{pharmacokinetic}} {{properties of}} <b>sultamicillin</b> are improved {{compared to a}} combination of ampicillin and sulbactam. <b>Sultamicillin</b> increases the absorption and decreases the chances of diarrhea and dysentery. The inclusion of sulbactam extends ampicillin's spectrum of action to beta-lactamase producing strains of bacteria. Oral sulbactam with parenteral form provides a regimen of continuous sulbactam therapy throughout the treatment, resulting in better clinical results.|$|E
50|$|Linezolid or {{daptomycin}} is used {{to treat}} VRE infections. The streptogramins, such as quinupristin/dalfopristin, may {{also be used for}} VREs. VRE can be successfully treated with <b>sultamicillin.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Sultamicillin</b> is an oral {{form of the}} {{antibiotic}} combination (codrug or mutual prodrug) ampicillin/sulbactam. It contains esterified ampicillin and sulbactam and is marketed under a number of trade names, e. g. Unasyn from Pfizer.|$|E
50|$|Ampicillin/sulbactam is a {{combination}} of the common penicillin-derived antibiotic ampicillin and sulbactam, an inhibitor of bacterial beta-lactamase. Two different forms of the drug exist. The first, developed in 1987 and marketed in the United States under the tradename Unasyn, generic only outside of the United States, is an intravenous antibiotic. The second, an oral form called <b>sultamicillin,</b> is marketed under the trade name Ampictam outside of the United States. And generic only in the United States, ampicillin/sulbactam is used to treat infections caused by bacteria resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. Sulbactam blocks the enzyme which breaks down ampicillin and thereby allows ampicillin to attack and kill the bacteria.|$|E
40|$|The {{irreversible}} beta-lactamase inhibitor sulbactam {{has been}} combined chemically via ester linkages with ampicillin to form <b>sultamicillin.</b> Upon oral absorption, <b>sultamicillin</b> is completely hydrolyzed to equimolar proportions of sulbactam and ampicillin, thereby acting as an efficient mutual prodrug. In rats, <b>sultamicillin</b> delivered 2 to 2. 5 times greater total bioavailability for ampicillin and sulbactam than when each was used individually. Actual plasma or serum concentrations (measured in micrograms per milliliter) of ampicillin and sulbactam produced by <b>sultamicillin</b> were generally equivalent in rats, mice, and beagle dogs. Further studies {{also indicated that}} the components of <b>sultamicillin</b> were widely distributed in the various tissues of rats. These findings suggest that <b>sultamicillin</b> might be an effective agent against a variety of infections produced by both beta-lactamase-resistant and beta-lactamase-susceptible microorganisms...|$|E
40|$|Fifty-two {{children}} with superficial skin and soft tissue infections were randomized to receive <b>sultamicillin</b> or cloxacillin for 7 days. Twenty-one children {{in each group}} finished the study. A total of 16 of 21 in the <b>sultamicillin</b> group and 13 of 21 in the cloxacillin group were cured. One child in the <b>sultamicillin</b> group and two in the cloxacillin group failed therapy. Four children who received <b>sultamicillin</b> and six who received cloxacillin had recurrences of lesions. Differences were not statistically significant...|$|E
40|$|The {{pharmacokinetics}} of <b>sultamicillin</b> and ampicillin suspensions {{were studied}} in 20 {{infants and children}} 8 months to 69 months of age (mean age, 27 months). Mean peak plasma concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam occurred at 90 minutes after administration of 42 - 5 mg of <b>sultamicillin</b> (25 mg of ampicillin/kg and 17 5 mg of sulbactam/kg) per kg to fasting and non-fasting patients. Co-administration of milk usually resulted in higher concentrations of ampicillin and sulbactam, however, {{the differences in the}} AUC values between the fasting and fed groups were not statistically significant. <b>Sultamicillin</b> and ampicillin were administered in cross-over fashion to ten children Plasma concentrations of ampicillin after 42 - 5 mg of <b>sultamicillin</b> per kg were greater at 20, 40, and 60 min than those after 25 mg of ampicillin per kg alone and the AUC was 39 % larger in subjects who received <b>sultamicillin</b> than in those who received ampicillin. Plasma bactericidal activity against a non-/?-lactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae strain was similar for children who were given sultamicilhn or ampicillin. Against a /?-lactamase-producing Haemophilus strain the median bactericidal titres were 1 : 8 at 40, 60 and 90 min after <b>sultamicillin</b> and < 1 : 2 at the same intervals after ampicillin...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sultamicillin</b> is a {{covalent}} {{union of}} ampicillin and the beta lactamase inhibitor, sulbactam (CP- 45, 899). Two studies {{were conducted to}} assess its efficacy in treating uncomplicated gonorrhoea. In the first study treatment comprised <b>sultamicillin</b> 1. 5 g and probenecid 1 g; 124 (89. 2 %) of 139 patients responded including seven of 11 patients harbouring beta lactamase (penicillinase) producing strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae (PPNG). In the second study <b>sultamicillin</b> 2. 25 g and probenecid 1 g were given; 122 (93. 8 %) of 130 patients responded. Only two of seven pharyngeal infections resolved, and if pharyngeal infections are excluded the overall cure rate rose to 95. 3 %. Thirteen of 14 patients infected with PPNG strains were cured by the larger dose. Side effects were mild and transitory. It may be concluded that <b>sultamicillin</b> 2. 25 g plus probenecid 1 g is an effective regimen to treat uncomplicated rectal and genital gonorrhoea and is useful for treating infections with PPNG strains. Most beta lactamase resistant antimicrobials must be given parenterally; <b>sultamicillin</b> is given by mouth...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sultamicillin</b> is an orally absorbed double ester of {{sulbactam}} (penicillanic acid sulphone, a semisynthetic inhibitor of the /Mactamases of many Gram-positive and Gram-negative species) and ampicillin. First-pass hydrolysis of this prodrug liberates equimolar {{proportions of}} sulbactam and ampicillin into the systemic circulation. An HPLC assay for sulbactam in plasma, saliva and urine is described {{and was used}} to determine the absolute bioavailability of sulbactam and ampicil-lin from <b>sultamicillin</b> in six normal male volunteers who each received a single 750 mg oral dose of <b>sultamicillin</b> or an iv dose of the equivalent amounts of ampicillin (441 mg) and sulbactam (294 mg). Treatments were given in random order with not less than four days intervening. The mean peak plasma concen-trations and time to peak of sulbactam and ampicillin following the 750 mg oral dose of <b>sultamicillin</b> were 8 - 9 and 91 mg/ 1 and 0 - 96 and 0 - 92 h respectively. The half lives, systemic and renal clearances for sulbactam and ampicillin were simi-lar. The bioavailability for both drugs from <b>sultamicillin</b> as estimated from both plasma and urine pharmacokinetics was better than 80 %. We conclude that <b>sultamicillin</b> is an extremely efficient prodrug for ampicillin and sulbactam and that the HPLC assay method is accurate, rapid and easier to perform than the differential microbiological assay...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} {{and the safety}} of parenteral sulbactam/ampicillin followed by oral sultamicillin* has been evaluated in 41 children aged between 0. 5 and 15 years presenting with various infections. Overall clinical and bateriologial success was achieved in 92 % of evaluable cases; 97 % of 22 pathogens isolated in these patients were eradicated. Adverse reactions were pain at the intramuscular injections site (7 %) which was minimized by concurrent injection of lidocaine. Gastro-intestinal disturbances with soft stools were common during oral <b>sultamicillin</b> therapy. Laboratory tests remained normal. Parental sulbactam/ampicillin followed by oral <b>sultamicillin</b> is useful therapy for the treatment of serious non-life-threatening paediatric infections...|$|E
40|$|Nine {{children}} with osteomyelitisand/or septic arthritis were treated sequentially with paren-teral sulbactam/ampicillin and oral <b>sultamicillin.</b> Causative pathogens {{were identified in}} six cases; all were susceptible to the combination of ampicillin and sulbactam. The mean duration of parenteral therapy was 7. 1 days (6 - 11 days), and the average hospital stay was 10. 3 days (6 - 18 days). Peak serum bactericidal titers of ~ 1 : 8 were achieved in all patients during parenteral therapy; only one child receiving oral therapy did not achieve a titer of ~ 1 : 4. At follow-up, {{all of the children}} were cured clinically and {{there was no evidence of}} relapse. Adverse reactions to oral therapy were minimal. The regimen of parenteral sulbactam/ampicillin and oral <b>sultamicillin</b> used sequentially is effective and safe for the treatment of skeletal infections in children. The use of this approach significantly reduced the duration of hospitalization. Effective treatment of bone and joint infections in children requires prolonged administration of an-timicrobial agents [1 - 3].

40|$|<b>Sultamicillin,</b> a new semisynthetic oral {{beta-lactam}} antibiotic, {{was evaluated}} for its antibacteria susceptibility and clinical efficacy against {{urinary tract infection}} (UTI), and the following results were obtained. The sensitivity of <b>sultamicillin</b> (SBTPC) on 518 strains of clinical isolates from the urine were tested and compared to ampicillin (ABPC). S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Enterococcus sp., Streptococcus sp., E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, P. mirabilis, M. morganii and Acinetobacter sp. showed high sensitivity to SBTPC. The antibacterial activity of SBTPC was superior to that of ABPC in most strains and especially more superior in beta-lactamase producing strains. The clinical effectiveness rate on a total of 15 patients with acute uncomplicated cystitis was 93. 3 % and the eradication rate of causative organisms was 93. 3 %. On 15 patients with chronic complicated UTI, the clinical effectiveness rate was 73. 3 % and eradication rate was 76. 5 %. Side effects (diarrhea) were observed in 3 cases, but this symptom was not severe and soon disappeared. Abnormal laboratory data due to the drug were not observed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sultamicillin,</b> an {{antibiotic}} combining ampicillin and the beta-lactamase inhibitor sulbactam, {{was administered to}} 13 patients diagnosed as having acute sinusitis. Specimens from sinus were obtained for all 13 patients by transantral puncture. Pharmacokinetics, bacteriology, and therapeutic efficacy were assessed. Eighty-five percent (11 of 13) were cured; two treatment failures were subsequently shown to have chronic (rather than acute) sinusitis during surgical exploration. Diarrhea was frequently encountered, and Clostridium difficile-associated enteritis was documented for one patient. Beta-lactamase-producing organisms were not encountered in this study; however, this study provides impetus for further controlled clinical trials...|$|E

40|$|There are few {{reports of}} a {{transverse}} colon inguinal hernia; furthermore, an inguinal hernia perforating the scrotum is rare. Here we report {{the case of a}} 79 -year-old man who died after developing an incarcerated colon inguinal hernia that perforated the scrotum and exhibited an air-fluid level. The patient was referred to our hospital in November 2011 with a complaint of inability to move. Physical examination revealed an abnormally enlarged left scrotum and cold extremities. He reported a history of gastric cancer that was surgically treated more than 30 years ago. His white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level were elevated. Abdominal and inguinal computed tomography revealed that his transverse colon was incarcerated in the left inguinal canal. Free air and air-fluid level were observed around the transverse colon, suggestive of a perforation. The patient and his family refused any surgical intervention; therefore, he was treated with <b>sultamicillin</b> tosilate hydrate and cefotiam hydrochloride.

40|$|Background: Acute {{bacterial}} sinusitis {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes for antibacterial treatment. Oral Penbactam (ampicillin- sulbactum or <b>Sultamicillin)</b> is a broad spectrum antibiotic and it has no significant side effect. To our knowledge, this is the first study in Iran in which, oral Penbactam has been prescribed for patients with acute bacterial sinusitis. Methods: A randomized clinical trial was performed on 44 outpatients diagnosed with acute bacterial sinusitis in Amir- Aalam Hospital from March 2003 - 2004 to August 2004. Patients were randomized in 2 group: 23 to oral Penbactam (375 mg twice daily), and 21 to oral Co-amoxicolav (625 mg three times daily). Duration of treatment was 10 days for both groups. Results: Both groups showed a significant clinical improvement after 10 days of treatment. In the Penbactam group, 19 of 23 (86. 36 %) and in the Co-amoxicolav group, 18 of 21 (85. 71 %) showed clinical improvement. In the Penbactam group, one patient (4. 3 %) developed diarrhea and the medication was discontinued. Conclusion: Oral Penbactam is an effective and safe antibiotic in the treatment of acute bacterial sinusitis and could be used as an alternative medication for acute bacterial sinusitis...|$|E
40|$|Infection of {{the central}} nervous system with Nocardia sp. usually manifests as {{supratentorial}} abscesses. Supratentorial and cerebellar abscesses from infection with Nocardia sp. following immunosuppression with long-term corticosteroids for idiopathic thrombocytopenia (ITP) have not been reported. An 83 years-old, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -negative, polymorbid male with ITP for which he required corticosteroids since age 53 years developed tiredness, dyspnoea, hemoptysis, abdominal pain, and progressive gait disturbance. Imaging studies of the lung revealed an enhancing tumour in the right upper lobe with central and peripheral necrosis, multiple irregularly contoured hyperdensities over both lungs, and right-sided pleural effusions. Sputum culture grew Nocardia sp. Neurological diagnostic work-up revealed dysarthria, dysphagia, ptosis, hypoacusis, tremor, dysdiadochokinesia, proximal weakness of the lower limbs, diffuse wasting, and stocking-type sensory disturbances. The neurological deficits were attributed to an abscess in the upper cerebellar vermis, myopathy from corticosteroids, and polyneuropathy. Meropenem for 37 days and trimethoprime-sulfamethoxazole for 3 months resulted in a reduction of the pulmonary, but not the cerebral lesions. Therefore, <b>sultamicillin</b> was begun, but without success. Long-term therapy with corticosteroids for ITP may induce not only steroid myopathy but also immune-incompetence with the development of pulmonary and cerebral nocardiosis. Cerebral nocardiosis may not sufficiently respond to long-term antibiotic therapy why switching to alternative antibiotics or surgery may be necessary...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{appropriate}} use {{of antibiotics}} prophylaxis in the prevention and reduction {{in the incidence of}} surgical site infection is widespread. This study evaluates the appropriateness of the prescription of antibiotics prophylaxis prior to surgery amongst hospitalized patients in the geographic area of Avellino, Caserta, and Naples (Italy) and the factors associated with a poor adherence. METHODS: A sample of 382 patients admitted to 23 surgical wards and undergoing surgery in five hospitals were randomly selected. RESULTS: Perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis was appropriate in 18. 1 % of cases. The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that patients with hypoalbuminemia, with a clinical infection, with a wound clean were more likely to receive an appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis. Compared with patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score ≥ 4, those with a score of 2 were correlated with a 64 % reduction in the odds of having an appropriate prophylaxis. The appropriateness of the timing of prophylactic antibiotic administration was observed in 53. 4 % of the procedures. Multivariate logistic regression model showed that such appropriateness was more frequent in older patients, in those admitted in general surgery wards, in those not having been underwent an endoscopic surgery, in those with a higher length of surgery, and in patients with ASA score 1 when a score ≥ 4 was chosen as the reference category. The most common antibiotics used inappropriately were ceftazidime, <b>sultamicillin,</b> levofloxacin, and teicoplanin.

40|$|Upper {{respiratory}} tract infections {{are the most}} common causes of medical visits in children and adults, demanding massive use of antibiotics. Bacterial resistance caused by beta-lactamase {{is one of the most}} serious problems in this matter. <b>Sultamicillin,</b> a double pro-drug of Ampicillin/Sulbactan, is a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor which can face this challenge. Aim: evaluate efficacy, safety and tolerability of Ampicillin/Sulbactan compared to Amoxicillin/ Clavulanate in upper {{respiratory tract}} infections in adults. Methods: 102 patients were enrolled and randomized to receive Ampicillin/Sulbactan or Amoxicillin/Clavulanate during 10 days. They were evaluated 10 and 30 days after treatment to learn about the therapeutic response. Results: There were no differences between the two groups respecting cure at the end of treatment (visit 2) or at the end of the study (visit 3). Cure ratio was 61. 7 % and 93. 2 % (visits 2 and 3) in the Amoxicillin/Clavulanate group compared to 64. 4 % and 97. 4 %, respectively, in Ampicillin/Sulbactan group.

40|$|Thirty hospitalised {{patients}} with acute purulent exacerbations of chronic bron-chitis were treated orally with either 750 or 1000 mg of <b>sultamicillin</b> (a mutual prodrug of ampicillin and sulbactam) twice daily for ten days. Twenty-eight {{of these patients}} were evaluated for clinical response at end-of-treatment (day 11) and at one week post-treatment (day 17). The overall clinical cure rates at these times were 73 % (22 / 30) and 60 % (18 / 30) respectively. Five fj-lactamase-producing organisms were identified in the pre-treatment sputum specimens, but all were eliminated by day 17. The means of the peak serum concentrations of ampicillin achieved after the first 750 and 1000 mg doses were 9 - 1 and 14 - 4 mg/ 1 respectively, the corresponding values for sulbactam being 6 - 4 and 7 - 9 mg/ 1. Both the ampicil-lin and the sulbactam peaks occurred approximately one hour after dosage. Mean peak sputum concentrations of ampicillin of 0 - 7 and 1 - 2 mg/ 1 were achieved fol-lowing the 750 and 1000 mg doses.
