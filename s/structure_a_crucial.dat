40|$|Abstract—Markov {{logic is}} a knowledge-representation {{language}} that {{allows one to}} specify large graphical models. However, the resulting large graphical models can make inference for Markov logic a computationally challenging problem. Recently, dual decomposition (DD) has become a popular approach for scalable inference on graphical models. We study how to apply DD to scale up inference in Markov logic. A standard approach for DD first partitions a graphical model into multiple tree-structured subproblems. We apply this approach to Markov logic and show that DD can outperform prior inference approaches. Nevertheless, we observe that the standard approach for DD is suboptimal as it does not exploit the rich structure often present in the Markov logic program. Thus, we describe a novel decomposition strategy that partitions a Markov logic program into parts based on its <b>structure.</b> <b>A</b> <b>crucial</b> advantage of our approach {{is that we can}} use specialized algorithms for portions of the input problem – some of which have been studied for decades, e. g., coreference resolution.

OMZ expansion greatly affects biogeochemical processes and marine life, especially by constraining the vertical habitat of most marine organisms. Currently, monitoring the variability of the upper limit of the OMZs relies on time intensive sampling protocols, causing poor spatial resolution. Methodology/Principal Findings Using routine underwater acoustic observations of the vertical distribution of marine organisms, we propose a new method that allows determination of the upper limit of the OMZ with a high precision. Applied in the eastern South-Pacific, this original sampling technique provides high-resolution information on the depth of the upper OMZ allowing documentation of mesoscale and submesoscale features (e. g., eddies and filaments) that structure the upper ocean and the marine ecosystems. We also use this information to estimate the habitable volume for the world's most exploited fish, the Peruvian anchovy (Engraulis ringens). Conclusions/Significance This opportunistic method could be implemented on any vessel geared with multi-frequency echosounders to perform comprehensive high-resolution monitoring of the upper limit of the OMZ.

For instance, the ability to identify and quantify internal forces can greatly improve the estimation of parameters of a numerical model. In this paper, the identification of internal forces in a mechanical system has been investigated by {{the application of the}} Transfer Path Analysis (TPA) technique. TPA can be summarized as a test based approach which allows the analysis of the contribution of different vibration paths in a <b>structure.</b> <b>A</b> <b>crucial</b> step of the entire procedure is determined by the calculation of the forces exciting the structure. Different approaches are available for this purpose. Here, the Matrix Inversion (MI) method is used. The mechanical system under examination is a bearing test rig. The aim is to estimate internal forces acting at the proximity of the bearings, under operating conditions, by the implementation of the TPA technique with the specific MI method. A Monte-Carlo simulation is also performed as a measure of the sensitivity of the method to errors in the experimental Frequency Response Function matrix. The internal forces are also directly measured by load cells installed at the specific locations, making this test rig an ideal tool for validation of the proposed technique.

Meanwhile, these 1 D ZnO nanostructures have been widely applied as room temperature UV detector [3], transparent conductive electrodes [4], sensors [1, 5 – 7], and solar cells [8]. Recently, various inorganic semiconductor nanostructures have been the focus of the researches on the studies of FE properties [9] and wetting behavior [10], including the well-aligned 1 D ZnO nanostructured arrays which have attracted great attention as promising field emission (FE) sources [1, 11 – 14] due to their negative electron affinity [15], chemical stability, tip geometry, or apex <b>structure.</b> <b>A</b> <b>crucial</b> factor to influence FE performance includes the interspacing between individual nanowires or nanorods, and aspect ratio.

Such a high-resolution model will provide a reliable picture of the present day lithospheric <b>structure,</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> constraint to understand the complex geodynamic evolution in the study area. As a first step towards a full 3 D inversion, we have performed a 1 D nonlinear Bayesian (probabilistic) inversion of a wide variety of data sets (surface wave dispersion curves, surface heat flow, elevation), extensively exploring the parameter space by means of a coupled geophysical-petrological inversion algorithm. The most prominent feature in the modeled structure is the progressive northward and northeastward steepening of the lithospheric-asthenospheric boundary (LAB) below the Ebro basin, reaching > 120 km under the central and western Pyrenees. Similarly, absolute maximum values of crustal thickness are obtained in the central Pyrenees, locally exceeding 45 km. Further to the west the Moho discontinuity shallows to about 35 km beneath the Cantabrian Cordillera. A dramatic decrease in both crustal and lithospheric thickness is observed from the central towards the easternmost Pyrenees, reaching depths of about 25 km and 90 km for the Moho and LAB respectively. Average Moho depth values of about 30 km are estimated in the central Iberian Peninsula. A slightly thicker crust is predicted under the Gibraltar arc than under the Betics, consistently with the deeper LAB beneath the former, most likely reflecting the presence of a sinking lithospheric slab. For the rest of the Iberian Peninsula a rather flat topography of LAB and Moho is observed, with moderate lithospheric thinning below the central western and SE Iberian margins. Isostatic topography related to variations in predicted crustal thickness shows significant discrepancies form observed topography, thus indicating important regional contributions from dynamic and mantle source.

40|$|This study {{presents}} an innovative strategy for automatic {{evaluation of the}} variable fundamental frequency and related damping factors of nonlinear structures during strong motion phases. Most of methods for damage detection {{are based on the}} assessment of the variations of the dynamic parameters characterizing the monitored <b>structure.</b> <b>A</b> <b>crucial</b> aspect of these methods is the automatic and accurate estimation of both structural eigen-frequencies and related damping factors also during the nonlinear behaviour. A new method based on the nonlinear interferometric analysis combined with the Fourier Transform (FT) (Short-Time Impulse Response Function - STIRF) is here proposed in order to characterize frequencies and damping variations of a monitored structure. The STIRF approach helps to overcome some limitation derived from the use of techniques based on simple Fourier Transform. These latter techniques provide good results when the response of the monitored system is stationary, but fails when the system exhibits a non-stationary, time-varying behaviour: even non-stationary input, soil-foundation and/or adjacent structures interaction phenomena can show the inadequacy of classic techniques to analysing the nonlinear and/or non-stationary behaviour of structures. In fact, using this kind of approach it is possible to improve some of the existing methods for the automatic damage detection providing stable results also during the strong motion phase. Results are consistent with those expected if compared with other techniques. The main advantage derived from the use of the proposed approach (STIRF) for Structural Health Monitoring is based on the simplicity of the interpretation of the nonlinear variations of the fundamental frequency and the related equivalent viscous damping factor. The proposed methodology has been tested on both numerical and experimental models also using data retrieved from shaking table tests. Based on the results provided in this study, the methodology seems to be able to evaluate fast variations (over time) of dynamic parameters of a generic reinforced concrete framed structure. Further analyses are necessary to better calibrate the length of the moving time-window (in order to minimize the spurious frequency within each Interferometric Response Function evaluated on both weak and strong motion phases) and to verify the possibility to use the STIRF to analyse the nonlinear behaviour of general systems...|$|E
