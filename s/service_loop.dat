40|$|The thesis {{takes the}} {{position}} that the single-family house will soon move into a consumer cycle of disposability similar to that of products like single-use cameras. This analogy suggests a new house type that uses such material and acquisition cycles to its advantage, creating a <b>service</b> <b>loop</b> within it's very production and distribution. The result is an intelligent object that has the ability to recreate itself many times over by cycling its own material components. While following existing HUD guidelines governing their delivery, construction, and removal, these house units would also be mapped with a second (a third, a fourth [...] .) life cycle for each component material. In addition, the building would be tethered to the original manufacturer and destined for resale, to be de-manufactured and upcycled into new house units or new material products {{at the end of each}} life...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} a non-cooperative four rational player’s static game framework to analyse the shipping alliance competition {{on a particular}} Far East-Northern Europe liner shipping <b>service</b> <b>loop.</b> The complete-perfect information case of the players is taken into account and the Cournot-Nash equilibrium pure strategy solution concept is utilised. The approach developed in this study focuses on the current liner shipping alliance structure and assumes the long term stability of the current alliances. The research steps are mathematically integrated to different methodological outcomes and numerically tested in the given case study. The results suggested that, in a two year period, additional ship capacity deployment would reduce the competitiveness of the alliances. It is proposed that outcomes of this research will provide significant theoretical contribution to the existing literature and will generate a robust tactical decision support rationale regarding to the capacity deployment problem of the liner container shipping industry...|$|E

40|$|The Drill for the Mars Science Laboratory {{mission is}} a rotary-percussive sample {{acquisition}} device {{with an emphasis}} on toughness and robustness to handle the harsh environment on Mars. The unique challenges associated with autonomous drilling from a mobile robot are addressed. A highly compressed development schedule dictated a modular design architecture that satisfies the functional and load requirements while allowing independent development and testing of the Drill subassemblies. The Drill consists of four actuated mechanisms: a spindle that rotates the bit, a chuck that releases and engages bits, a novel voice-coil-based percussion mechanism that hammers the bit, and a linear translation mechanism. The Drill has three passive mechanisms: a replaceable bit assembly that acquires and collects sample, a contact sensor / stabilizer mechanism, and, lastly a flex harness <b>service</b> <b>loop.</b> This paper describes the various mechanisms that makeup the Drill and discusses the solutions to their unique design and development challenges...|$|E
40|$|A {{decentralized}} {{system is}} a distributed system that operates under multiple, distinct spheres of authority in which collaboration among the principals is characterized by mutual distrust. Now commonplace, decentralized systems appear {{in a number of}} disparate domains: commerce, logistics, medicine, software development, manufacturing, and financial trading to name but a few. These systems of systems face two overlapping demands: security and safety to protect against errors, omissions and threats; and ease of adaptation in response to attack, faults, regulatory requirements, or market demands. 	We consider decentralized systems in the context of architectural style, a domain-specific set of rules or constraints that confer benefits to the system in question. COmputAtional State Transfer (COAST) is an architectural style for decentralized systems where mobile code (more specifically, the exchange of live computations) is the principal interaction among peers. COAST exchanges rely on communication by introduction, meaning that a peer x can communicate with a peer y only if peer x holds a Capability URL (CURL) for y. CURLs are cryptographic structures; they are tamper-proof and cannot be guessed or forged. Live computations received by peers via CURLs are evaluated in the context of execution sites, flexible sandboxes that confine the functional and communication capability of visiting computations. 	These four fundamentals: communication by introduction, mobile code, execution sites and CURLs, are sufficient to protect against many common security threats including unwanted intrusion, resource theft, or gross abuse of capability. These same four concepts also account for a considerable degree of adaptation and flexibility. More broadly, the COAST architectural style embeds computation exchange in the object-capability model of security; both computation exchange and object-capability contribute in equal measure to security and adaptation. 	To validate the twin claims of security and adaptation for COAST we constructed a -compliant reference implementation comprising Motile, a language for mobile code exchange and execution, and Island, a peering infrastructure for decentralized systems. We performed four studies with the Motile and Island platform: two each directed at adaptation and security. 	The first adaptation study analyzed the problem of cooperative live update of a simple server, a gold standard for adaptive systems. Modeling an individual server as an endless <b>service</b> <b>loop</b> reading and responding to service requests we constructed Motile/Island protocols for three forms of server update: live update in place, live update with hot backup in a single address space, and live remote update with hot backup in which the update is instantiated in a remote address space. This evaluation demonstrates that COAST is capable of fail-safe cooperative live update for individual services in a decentralized system. 	The second adaptation study examined the problem of evolving web service APIs, in particular client-driven API evolution. Using a web bookmark service as a test case, we demonstrate a minimalist service API that is extended per-client by client-developed mobile code delivered provider-side. The client code examples illustrate that service API extension and adaptation can be shifted from a service provider to the service clients, thereby easing the burdens on a service provider and speeding the pace of service evolution. We conclude that COAST is well-suited for client-driven service extension and customization. 	The first security study offers a proof, by case analysis, that COAST is authority-safe and that Motile is a capability-safe language, hence authority-safe. These results place COAST and Motile/Island squarely within the growing body of work on the security and safety of capability-safe languages and confirms that the idioms and patterns of object-capability security are available to. 	In the second security study we evaluated COAST with respect to architectural accountability and obtained outcomes that indicate COAST is well-suited for capability accounting, a system accounting practice in which capability is the basic unit of exchange within and among systems. Our results include a communication capability analysis of a model financial transaction system, mapping points of capability creation, exchange, and exercise to system actions, and a sample analysis of capability traces for verifying system behavior and detecting process and security faults. This preliminary experiment hints that capability accounting may be useful for debugging, behavioral analysis, or early warning of threatening security events...|$|E
