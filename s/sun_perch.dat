5000|$|The redear sunfish (Lepomis microlophus, {{also known}} as the shellcracker, Georgia bream, cherry gill, chinquapin, {{improved}} bream, rouge ear sunfish and <b>sun</b> <b>perch)</b> is freshwater fish native to the southeastern United States. Since it is a popular sport fish, it has been introduced to bodies of water all over North America. It is known for its diet of mollusks and snails.|$|E
50|$|Huntersville {{has many}} sportsman opportunities. Because of its {{proximity}} to Knapps Creek flowing nearby, fishermen can catch trout, bass, <b>sun</b> <b>perch,</b> and other fish. Native brook trout streams are also tucked away in quiet places close to the town. Hunting is a big tradition that still lives on in this community because of the vast stretches of Monongahela National Forest that borders the town.|$|E
60|$|There was no {{need for}} the Rainbow's Daughter to answer, for turning the bend in the road there came {{advancing}} slowly toward them a funny round man made of burnished copper, gleaming brightly in the <b>sun.</b> <b>Perched</b> on the copper man's shoulder sat a yellow hen, with fluffy feathers and a pearl necklace around her throat.|$|R
5000|$|Core body, or {{thoracic}} {{temperatures of}} around 24 degrees Celsius {{are necessary for}} flight. Therefore, the black swallowtail will regulate thoracic temperatures by behaviorally changing their abdomen position, wing position, orientation to the <b>sun,</b> <b>perching</b> duration, and perching height. In lower temperatures, butterflies will raise their abdomens above flattened wings, and will perch relatively close to the ground. [...] In higher temperatures, butterflies will lower their abdomens {{in the shade of}} their wings. Higher temperatures are also associated with shorter perch durations, greater flight durations and higher perch heights.|$|R
50|$|The fish {{population}} in the lake includes <b>perch,</b> <b>sun</b> fish, cat fish and muskellunge.|$|R
5000|$|Eustrongylides {{has been}} found in a variety of {{wildlife}} species including freshwater fishes. [...] Eustrongylides sp. has been observed in perch (Perca fluviatilis), sheat fish (Silurus glanis), pike (Esox lucius), pikeperch (Sander lucioperca), and <b>sun</b> <b>perch</b> (Lepomis eupomotis gibbosus). [...] Eustrongylides sp. has also be observed in wading birds (Ciconiiformes) including great blue herons (Ardea herodias), great egrets (Casmerodius albus), and snowy egrets (Egretta thula).|$|E
5000|$|Woodson is {{situated}} in semi-arid rolling hills covered in mesquite with [...] "jumping" [...] and prickly pear cactus, [...] "blue brush" [...] and occasional live or post oaks. It has often hot dry summers and cold dry winters. The creek bottoms have huge pecan trees, hackberry, willow, [...] "china berry", [...] "chitelm", elm, cottonwood, and wild plums of several kinds {{as well as many}} other trees of various types occurring at times (bois d'arc, and mulberry are seen). The ground along creeks may be covered in green briars, poison ivy or oak and Virginia creeper grows high into the trees in places. The land, as a whole, is a patchwork of mesquite, and farm fields dotted with old oil wells. It is home to white-tailed deer, wild turkey, cotton-tailed and jack rabbits, feral hogs, bobcats, raccoons, opossum, rattlesnake, bobwhite quail, mourning doves, armadillo, coyotes, an occasional badger, beaver, fox, mountain lion, and even javalina is seen. Song birds and others thrive. There are many small animals like fox squirrels, hispid cotton rats, soft-shelled turtles and others too numerous to mention. Large yellow catfish live in the slow moving rivers or in the local lake and stock tanks (ponds) along with many other fish like channel catfish, large-mouthed bass (black bass), crappie, gar, carp, buffalo fish, drum, bream and goggle-eyed <b>sun</b> <b>perch.</b> Red-horse minnows, top-water minnows and a species locally known as bull-head minnows live in the ponds and thrive in the rippling shallows of the river and creeks.|$|E
40|$|The {{groups of}} nemathodes who infect fish has been studyied {{since it has}} been noticed that these parasites infect a large variety of organisms, being {{widespread}} all over the world, in both freshwater and marine species. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the infections with Eustrongylides sp. in perch, pike, pikeperch, sheat fish, and <b>sun</b> <b>perch,</b> fished into the natural Romanian's lakes, around the Danubian Delta. Our study started on October 2005 and ended on March 2008. The fish have been clinically, pathologically and parasitologically examinated. Following these exams, we have identified the Eustrongylides sp. larvae in muscles, cavity of body and gut in perch, sheat fish and pike; in liver, mesentery and body cavity in pikeperch; into the cavity of body in <b>sun</b> <b>perch.</b> We have also noticed unspecific lesions in these structures, pointing out the presence of circulatory disturbances (congestion and hemorrhage). In perch we have observed the multiparasiting phenomenon, in which Eustrongylides sp. has been found associated with Myxobolus sp., Triaenophorus sp. and Piscicola sp. into the same host...|$|E
50|$|Some species, {{including}} the Dragonhunter (Hagenius brevistylus), reduce {{exposure to the}} <b>sun</b> by <b>perching</b> with the abdomen pointed downward, rather than upward. The tropical skimmer dragonfly Diastatops intensa, whose wings are mostly black, points its wings rather than its abdomen at the sun, apparently to reduce the heat they absorb.|$|R
50|$|The lido {{was built}} in 1937-38 to designs by the {{architect}} Richard Jones, and was hailed as the most innovative design of its type in Britain. With its tea terrace, <b>sun</b> deck, caf√©, <b>perched</b> on the flat roof and distinctive curved wings at either end, it became the only lido to be featured in the Design Museum in London.|$|R
25|$|It is a diurnal species, {{but it can}} {{be found}} moving about and hunting at night as well. They are often found by turning over rocks within or near the brooks and streams they inhabit. They will also come out of the water to bask in the <b>sun,</b> often <b>perching</b> on {{branches}} or roots above or near the waters edge. Queen snakes are very alert to any potential danger and will drop into the water when disturbed. They are rather docile snakes, not too likely to bite and can be easily handled. However, in doing so, one risks being polluted by malodorous feces and anal musk, similar to the behaviour of the garter snake in this defense.|$|R
5000|$|According to folklore, {{there were}} {{originally}} ten sun crows which settled in 10 separate <b>suns.</b> They <b>perched</b> {{on a red}} mulberry tree called the Fusang (...) , literally meaning [...] "the leaning mulberry tree", in the East {{at the foot of}} the Valley of the Sun. This mulberry tree was said to have many mouths opening from its branches. Each day one of the sun crows would be rostered to travel around the world on a carriage, driven by Xihe the 'mother' of the suns. As soon as one sun crow returned, another one would set forth in its journey crossing the sky. According to Shanhaijing, the sun crows loved eating two sorts of mythical grasses of immortality, one called the Diri (...) , or [...] "ground sun", and the other the Chunsheng (...) , or [...] "spring grow". The sun crows would often descend from heaven on to the earth and feast on these grasses, but Xihe did not like this thus she covered their eyes to prevent them from doing so.Folklore also held that, at around 2170 BC, all ten sun crows came out on the same day, causing the world to burn; Houyi the celestial archer saved the day by shooting down all but one of the sun crows. (See Mid-Autumn Festival for variants of this legend.) ...|$|R
