25|$|Hershey {{lost their}} next three games, {{starting}} with a home-and-home series against the Penguins on November 1 and 2, dropping the first after winger Matt Watkins missed a penalty shot in overtime, and Wilkes-Barre/Scranton scored with 25 {{seconds left in the}} extra period. The Bears lost the second game despite Leggio making 38 saves and Hershey scoring twice in their first three shots, just two minutes apart. In their 4–3 loss against Norfolk on November 3, the Bears scored three goals in three minutes during regulation, but failed to connect on the shootout. Orlov, having just returned from Washington, scored a goal and assist, leaving him tied for eighth in the league for defensemen with eight points, and first for shooting at 40 percent. He was sent back to the Capitals after one day back with Hershey. The Bears were successful in all 10 penalty kills over their past two games, bringing it to sixth-best in the league at 85.7 percent, although their power play was ranked 27th of 30 at 12 percent. Having won only one of five home games so far, Mike Haviland believed the team needed to stop feeling <b>so</b> <b>comfortable</b> on home ice.|$|E
25|$|When the U.S. Millionaire {{introduced}} its shuffle format, the Hot Seats and corresponding monitors were {{replaced with a}} single podium and as a result, the contestant and host stand throughout the game and are also able {{to walk around the}} stage. According to Vieira, the Hot Seat was removed because it was decided that the seat, which was originally intended to make the contestant feel nervous, actually ended up having contestants feel <b>so</b> <b>comfortable</b> in it that it did not service the production team any longer. Also, two video screens were installed–one that displays the current question in play, and another that displays the contestant's cumulative total and progress during the game. In September 2012, the redesigned set was improved with a modernised look and feel, in order {{to take into account the}} show's transition to high-definition broadcasting, which had just come about the previous year. The two video screens were replaced with two larger ones, having twice as many projectors as the previous screens; the previous contestant podium was replaced with a new one; and light-emitting diode (LED) technology was integrated into the lighting system to give the lights more vivid colours and the set and gameplay experience a more intimate feel.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, Tapping {{found it}} a {{challenge}} to play a different character, as Carter and Magnus have differing personalities and points of view; [...] "after playing a character like Sam Carter for so long where her physicality is <b>so</b> <b>comfortable</b> – Sam is <b>so</b> <b>comfortable</b> in her own skin and Helen is this very sexual, more mysterious being. She has a much darker edge to her and {{it was sort of}} finding that because Carter always looks on the bright side and Helen has been around so long, and has seen so much of the evil in human society if you will." [...] Whilst filming the webisodes, Tapping wore a dark-haired wig, but when the television series was being shot, she dyed her hair to match the hair colour of the wig. Tapping spoke with an English accent throughout the run of the series. Although many of her relatives are from the United Kingdom and speak with British accents Tapping found the accent a challenge, as her character came from the Victorian era, which is a [...] "very specific way of speaking. She clings to that eccentricity a bit, to that Britishness." [...] The actress listened to several different voices, as she had to factor in the fact that Magnus lived all around the world.|$|E

500|$|Mercedes {{struggles to}} eat healthily and her mid-week weigh-in shows {{that she has}} gained two pounds. She begins extreme dieting and faints in the school cafeteria. Former cheerleading captain Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) sympathizes with Mercedes, commending her for being <b>so</b> <b>comfortable</b> in her own body and advising her not to let being a {{cheerleader}} detract from that. Though Mercedes is embarrassed, Quinn tells her that she is beautiful. On {{the day of the}} pep rally, Mercedes abandons the planned routine, and instead sings [...] "Beautiful". The journalist from Splits Magazine assumes that Sue engineered the performance and expresses his admiration for her, promising her positive publicity from his article.|$|E
500|$|Unlike older {{game shows}} whose sets are or were {{designed}} to make the contestant(s) feel at ease, Millionaires set was designed to make the contestant feel uncomfortable, so that the program feels more like a movie thriller than a typical quiz show. The floor is made of Plexiglas beneath which lies a huge dish covered in mirror paper. Before the shuffle format was implemented in 2010, the main game had the contestant and host sit in chairs {{in the center of}} the stage, known as [...] "Hot Seats"; these measured [...] high, were modeled after chairs typically found in hair salons, and each seat featured a computer monitor directly facing it to display questions and other pertinent information. Shortly after the shuffle format was introduced to Millionaire, Vieira stated in an interview with her Millionaire predecessor on his morning talk show that the Hot Seat was removed because it was decided that the seat, which was originally intended to make the contestant feel nervous, actually ended up having contestants feel <b>so</b> <b>comfortable</b> in it that it did not service the production team any longer.|$|E
500|$|Hot Fuzz {{received}} critical acclaim. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes {{reported a}} 91% approval rating {{with an average}} rating of 7.7/10 based on 199 reviews. The website's consensus reads, [...] "The brilliant minds behind Shaun of the Dead successfully {{take a shot at}} the buddy cop genre with Hot Fuzz. The result is a bitingly satiric and hugely entertaining parody." [...] It also has a Metacritic score of 81/100. Olly Richards of Empire praised the chemistry between Pegg and Frost, saying: [...] "After almost a decade together, they're clearly <b>so</b> <b>comfortable</b> in each other's presence that they feel no need to fight for the punchline, making them terrific company for two hours". Johnny Vaughan of The Sun already called it the [...] "most arresting Brit-com of 2007". Phillip French of The Observer, who did not care for Shaun of the Dead, warmed to the comedy team in this film. The film also received positive reviews in the United States. Derek Elley of Variety praised Broadbent and Dalton as [...] "especially good as Angel's hail-fellow-well-met superior and oily No. 1 suspect". As an homage to the genre, the film was well received by screenwriter Shane Black. On Spill.com, it got their 2nd-highest rating of 'Full Price!!'.|$|E

500|$|On {{creating}} the character, Fazekas said the writers [...] "wanted {{to be really}} specific about who the woman is that Jarvis is just madly in love with" [...] in order to highlight the strong, platonic relationship Jarvis has with Carter. Fazekas added, [...] "It makes sense in that, Jarvis likes Peggy Carter, so of course the woman he's in love with {{would not be a}} quiet, prim and proper lady ... We also wanted to be very clear that Peggy and Ana really like each other, and that there's no jealousy from Ana. Ana and Jarvis are <b>so</b> <b>comfortable</b> in their relationship, they're not going to be jealous of other people coming in and out of their lives." [...] On some of the differences between Ana and Edwin, Verbeek said, [...] "The first scene we had I walk in and I smack him on his ass, which is a sort of sexual, playful, fun thing they have. That's not something he would do, that's something she does, and he loves it." [...] D'Arcy later revealed that Verbeek had improvised this on their first day on set, after having [...] " [...] flown in", calling it [...] "brilliantly courageous ... to do it to an actor you don’t know" [...] and [...] "so perfectly what they were hoping that Ana would be like." ...|$|E

She would say about the trip in 2011, [...] "I just {{fell in love with}} this place. I felt <b>so</b> <b>comfortable</b> here." [...] The Gonzaga women's basketball staff was equally enthusiastic about her, except for head coach Kelly Graves, who had little opportunity to see her during the camp. Graves would finally get to see Vandersloot at length in her junior year, on the day before the 2006 Washington Class 4A state tournament. He offered her a scholarship after seeing her practice, even though he did not stay for the tournament.|$|E

2500|$|The {{government}} {{refused to}} respond to her inquiries and protests, instead responding through the media that Maathai was [...] "a crazy woman"; that denying the project in Uhuru Park {{would take more than}} a small portion of public park land; and proclaiming the project as a [...] "fine and magnificent work of architecture" [...] opposed by only the [...] "ignorant few." [...] On 8 November 1989, Parliament expressed outrage at Maathai's actions, complaining of her letters to foreign organizations and calling the Green Belt Movement a bogus organization and its members [...] "a bunch of divorcees". They suggested that if Maathai was <b>so</b> <b>comfortable</b> writing to Europeans, perhaps she should go live in Europe.|$|E
2500|$|Taylor {{has been}} romantically linked to Ridge's {{half-brother}} Thorne (Winsor Harmon) multiple times. They were briefly involved from 1997 to 1998, when Ridge {{is in jail}} and urges Taylor to forget about him. Taylor also briefly lies about Thorne being Thomas' father. After accidentally killing Thorne's wife Darla in 2006, Taylor {{falls in love with}} Thorne, who is [...] "forgiving and loving" [...] towards her, even helping her attend AA. They nearly marry, but split up due to his then 4-year-old daughter Alexandria Forrester learning that Taylor killed Darla. Of working with Tylo, Harmon said, [...] "I am <b>so</b> <b>comfortable</b> with Hunter.

2500|$|Clayton Cramer, a historian, {{software}} engineer, gun enthusiast {{and early}} critic of Bellesiles, later {{argued that the}} reason [...] "why historians swallowed Arming Americas preposterous claims so readily is that it fit into their political worldview so well...Arming America said things, and created a system of thought <b>so</b> <b>comfortable</b> {{for the vast majority}} of historians, that they didn’t even pause to consider the possibility that something wasn’t right." [...] Historian Peter Charles Hoffer, an advocate of gun control, lent support to Cramer's charge when, in a 2004 examination of the Bellesiles case, he noted that influential members of the historical profession had [...] "taken strong public stands on violence in our society and its relation to gun control." [...] For instance, the academics solicited for blurbs by Bellesiles’ publisher Alfred A. Knopf [...] "were ecstatic in part because the book knocked the gun lobby." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Livadia left Greenock on October 3 with Popov, Tideman, Edward James Reed and William Houston Stewart on board. She safely reached Brest on October 7, {{where she}} picked up General Admiral of the Imperial Navy Grand Duke Constantine. [...] On October 8 the Livadia sailed into the Bay of Biscay and was soon caught in a violent storm. According to Reed, sailing {{straight}} into the storm to test the ship was Constantine's idea and that no Russian dared to argue. Waves of six to seven meters failed to upset the Livadia: transverse roll did not exceed 3.5 degrees, longitudinal pitch was within 5.5 degrees. Stewart praised {{the comfort of the}} Livadia: [...] "I never was in <b>so</b> <b>comfortable</b> a ship at sea in a gale of wind ... the absence of rolling, the easiness of motion, the great comfort on board, and the handiness of steering, were such as I have never seen before in any other ship under similar circumstances of weather and sea".|$|E
2500|$|In {{pre-production}} memos, Whedon {{described his}} vision for the score as [...] "spare, intimate, mournful and indefatigable". Just as the landscape and speech drew from elements of the Western, he wished the same of the musical style and instrumentation. However, {{he did not want}} to step too far into Western clichés to [...] "cause justified derision" [...] and hoped the score would also draw from Chinese and other Asian musical elements. He wanted the musical elements [...] "mixed up, hidden, or it's as much a cliché as the western feel. We don't want to be too specific about culture or time. We want to be comfortable enough with the sounds not to let them take us out of the story, but not <b>so</b> <b>comfortable</b> that we begin to be told where the story is." [...] Music was to draw heavily on what could be carried, and he highlighted four instruments: voice, percussion, woodwind, strings particularly guitar. He cautioned against vocal orchestration, believing there to be only two voices in Hollywood and wishing to avoid both, and advised moderation in woodwind, feeling wind instruments to be [...] "either too airy or too sophisticated".|$|E

They {{knew what was going on}} in my life, what I was going through ... and how I feel inside", Duff said. For songs she did not co-write, Duff discussed her experiences and feelings with the writers and ask them to write songs about them. Members of the creative team behind Metamorphosis who returned for Hilary Duff include Charlie Midnight, John Shanks and Kara DioGuardi (who collaborated on the commercially released singles), Andre Recke, Marc Swersky and Duff's sister Haylie. Hilary said, [...] "I do have a lot to say, and I have a lot going on inside that sometimes is buried and hidden because I'm working so hard, and I don't have time to think about it. But if we sit down and we talk about it and I tell her how I feel and she writes, it'll be good." ...|$|E
