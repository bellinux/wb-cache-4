5|$|Arrowslits, also {{commonly}} called loopholes, were narrow vertical openings in defensive walls which allowed arrows or crossbow bolts {{to be fired}} on attackers. The narrow slits were intended to protect the defender by providing a very small target, but {{the size of the}} opening could also impede the defender if it was too <b>small.</b> <b>A</b> smaller horizontal opening could be added to give an archer a better view for aiming. Sometimes a sally port was included; this could allow the garrison to leave the castle and engage besieging forces. It was usual for the latrines to empty down the external walls of a castle and into the surrounding ditch.|$|E
5|$|As {{political}} awareness among the black majority {{on the island}} spread, so did bebop, a kind of jazz which was associated, in the United States, with social activism and Afrocentrism. The first Barbadian bebop musician from the island was Keith Campbell, a pianist who had learned to play many styles while living in Trinidad {{during a time when}} American soldiers were stationed there, providing a ready market for bands that could play American music. Other musicians of this period included Ernie <b>Small,</b> <b>a</b> trumpeter and pianist, and bandleader St. Clare Jackman.|$|E
5|$|As {{the school}} roll grew, the old {{buildings}} became too <b>small.</b> <b>A</b> major building programme {{began in the}} 1950s: £128,000 was set aside to rehouse the school in purpose-built facilities adjacent to the existing school-houses. The first phase was opened in 1956 and included art and handicraft rooms; the second phase was completed in 1958 when physics and chemistry rooms were added; and the third came in 1965 {{with the opening of}} new biology and general science laboratories alongside other classrooms, while the following year saw a new hall/canteen and kitchen open. The final phase consisted of eight further rooms, built shortly afterwards.|$|E

5|$|Isaac Newton had {{considered}} the {{effect in the}} Principia, but pessimistically thought that any real mountain would produce too <b>small</b> <b>a</b> deflection to measure. Gravitational effects, he wrote, were only discernible on the planetary scale. Newton's pessimism was unfounded: although his calculations had suggested a deviation of less than 2minutes of arc (for an idealised three-mile high mountain), this angle, though very slight, was within the theoretical capability of instruments of his day.|$|E
5|$|The pieces {{relating}} to Ireland {{are those of}} a public nature; in which the Dean appears, as usual, in the best light, because they do honour to his heart {{as well as to}} his head; furnishing some additional proofs, that, though he was very free in his abuse of the inhabitants of that country, as well natives as foreigners, he had their interest sincerely at heart, and perfectly understood it. His sermon upon Doing Good, though peculiarly adapted to Ireland and Wood's designs upon it, contains perhaps the best motives to patriotism that were ever delivered within so <b>small</b> <b>a</b> compass.|$|E
5|$|All Bismarck's {{resources}} were deployed; he even asked Empress Victoria {{to use her}} influence with her son on his behalf. But the wizard had lost his magic; his spells were powerless because they were exerted on {{people who did not}} respect them, and he who had so signally disregarded Kant's command to use people as ends in themselves had too <b>small</b> <b>a</b> stock of loyalty to draw on. As Lord Salisbury told Queen Victoria: 'The very qualities which Bismarck fostered in the Emperor in order to strengthen himself when the Emperor Frederick should come to the throne have been the qualities by which he has been overthrown.' The Empress, with what must have been a mixture of pity and triumph, told him that her influence with her son could not save him for he himself had destroyed it.|$|E
