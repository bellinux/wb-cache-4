40|$|This paper {{measures}} and compares the network performance and hub competitive position of primary airports in the Asia-Pacific rim, {{taking into account}} {{the quantity and quality of}} both direct and indirect connections. The results reveal that Tokyo has the best network performance and hub competitive position. The most striking growth of network development is found at Chinese airports, while network performance deteriorates at Oceanian airports. Finally, the results show that the position of Oneworld and Star Alliance is stronger in this region, whereas SkyTeam has an innegligible position especially at Japanese airports, owing to the fifth and <b>sixth</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>rights.</b> Copyright 2009 The Authors.

50|$|Both the United States and the United Kingdom {{made the}} Bermuda Agreement their model for {{bilateral}} agreements {{with other countries}} until Bermuda II. The only major exception during this era was the 1966 agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union, which designated Pan Am and Aeroflot as the operating carriers from each country and left commercial details {{of service to the}} airlines' prior agreement. Although most other agreements during this era followed the Bermuda I model, they tended to include fewer and fewer fifth and <b>sixth</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>rights</b> (traffic rights to and from third countries) as time went on, as the increased range of aircraft made such rights less necessary. The general principles of the Bermuda Agreement were also followed by other countries, such as Canada in its various bilateral agreements.|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{hub-and-spoke}} network configurations {{are more and}} more developed in the Asia/Pacific region. In this paper, it is argued that the measurement of network performance in hub-and-spoke systems should take into account {{the quantity and quality of}} both direct and indirect connections. The NetScan Model, which quantifies an indirect connection and scales it into a theoretical direct connection, is applied to analyze the competitive position of airports or airlines in an integrated way. Measuring and comparing the network performance and the hub connectivity potential of selected seventeen primary airports in the Asia/Pacific region between 2001 and 2007 will be elaborated in this paper. The results revealed that Tokyo/Narita has the largest network performance and hub connectivity potential. The most striking growth of network developments can be found at Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. The number of both direct and indirect/onward connectivity at these airports increased at a much higher rate between these years than at other airports. On the contrary, Sydney, Melbourne and Auckland experienced deteriorating network performance. This region also showed stronger position of One World and Star Alliance. Sky Team, however, has an innegligible position especially at Tokyo/Narita and Osaka/Kansai, in addition to Seoul/Incheon, owing to fifth and <b>sixth</b> <b>freedom</b> <b>rights</b> of the Sky Team members. The analysis presented in this paper may be helpful for airports or airlines in identifying their network performance and competitive position in relation to competing airports or airlines...|$|R
50|$|Because {{the nature}} of air {{services}} agreements is essentially a mercantilist negotiation that strives for an equitable exchange of traffic rights {{the outcome of a}} bilateral agreement may not be fully reciprocal but rather a reflection of the relative size and geographic position of two markets, {{especially in the case of}} a large country negotiating with a much smaller one. In exchange for a smaller state granting fifth <b>freedom</b> <b>rights</b> to a larger country, the smaller country may be able to intermediate <b>sixth</b> <b>freedom</b> traffic to onward destinations from the larger country.|$|R
50|$|Fifth <b>freedom</b> traffic <b>rights</b> are {{sought by}} {{airlines}} wishing {{to take up}} unserved or underserved routes, or by airlines whose flights already make technical stops at a location as allowed by the second freedom. Governments (e.g. Thailand) may sometimes encourage fifth freedom traffic {{as a way of}} promoting tourism, by increasing the number of seats available. In turn, though, there may be reactionary pressure to avoid liberalizing traffic rights too much in order to protect a flag carrier's commercial interests. By the 1990s, fifth <b>freedom</b> traffic <b>rights</b> stirred controversy in Asia because of loss-making services by airlines in the countries hosting them. Particularly in protest over US air carriers' service patterns in Asia, some nations have become less generous with regard to granting fifth <b>freedom</b> traffic <b>rights,</b> while <b>sixth</b> <b>freedom</b> traffic has grown in importance for Asian airlines.|$|R
50|$|The Japan-United States {{bilateral}} {{air transport}} agreement of 1952 {{has been viewed}} as being particularly contentious, because unlimited fifth <b>freedom</b> traffic <b>rights</b> have been granted to designated US air carriers serving destinations in the Asia Pacific region west of Japan. For example, in the early 1990s, the Japanese government's refusal to permit flights on the New York City—Osaka—Sydney route led to protests by the US government and the airlines that applied to serve that route. The Japanese government countered that about 10% of the traffic on the Japan - Australia sector was third and fourth freedom traffic {{to and from the}} US, while the bilateral agreement specified that primary justification for unlimited fifth freedom traffic was to fill up aircraft carrying a majority of US-originated or US-destined traffic under third and fourth <b>freedom</b> <b>rights.</b> Japan had held many unused fifth <b>freedom</b> traffic <b>rights</b> beyond the USA. However, these were seen as being less valuable than the fifth <b>freedom</b> traffic <b>rights</b> enjoyed by US air carriers via Japan, because of the higher operating costs of Japanese airlines and geographical circumstances. Japan serves as a useful gateway to Asia for North American travelers. The US contended that Japan's favourable geographical location and its flag airlines' carriage of a sizeable volume of <b>sixth</b> <b>freedom</b> traffic via gateway cities in Japan helped to level the playing field. In 1995, the air transport agreement was updated by way of liberalizing Japanese carriers' access to US destinations, while placing selected restrictions on US air carriers.|$|R
50|$|The {{unofficial}} <b>sixth</b> <b>freedom</b> {{combines the}} third and fourth freedoms and is the right to carry passengers or cargo from a second country to a third country by stopping in one's own country. It can also be characterized as a form of the fifth freedom with an intermediate stop in the operating airline's home market. This characterization is often invoked as protectionist policy as the traffic, like fifth freedom traffic, is secondary in nature to third and fourth freedom traffic. Consequently, some nations seek to regulate <b>sixth</b> <b>freedom</b> traffic as though it were fifth freedom traffic. China {{is an example of a}} country that restricts <b>sixth</b> <b>freedom</b> traffic from third party countries. Specifically, it is difficult for airlines to obtain permission from China to serve the country via codeshare flights from intermediate countries.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the <b>freedom</b> <b>rights,</b> {{the nature of the}} rights to human dignity, to life, and not to be discriminated against, or the right to a fair trial, does not permit them to be waived: “Unlike the <b>freedom</b> <b>rights,</b> these rights cannot be exercised negatively.” The <b>right</b> to <b>freedom</b> of expression, for example, can be exercised by keeping quiet, but the right to dignity cannot be exercised by being abused. One cannot therefore assume that the right is exercised when it is waived (as one can, subject to the above considerations, with the <b>freedom</b> <b>rights).</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This article {{demonstrates}} that socioeconomic development, emancipative cultural change and democratization constitute a coherent syndrome of social progress – a syndrome whose common focus {{has not been}} properly specified by classical modernization theory. We specify this syndrome as ‘human development’, arguing that its three components have a common focus on broadening human choice. Socioeconomic development gives people the objective means of choice by increasing individual resources; rising emancipative values strengthen people’s subjective orientation towards choice; and democratization provides legal guarantees of choice by institutionalizing <b>freedom</b> <b>rights.</b> Analysis of data from the World Values Surveys {{demonstrates that}} the linkage between individual resources, emancipative values and <b>freedom</b> <b>rights</b> is universal in its presence across nations, regions and cultural zones; that this human development syndrome is shaped by a causal effect of individual resources and emancipative values on freedom rights; and that this effect operates through its impact on elite integrity, as the factor which makes <b>freedom</b> <b>rights</b> effective...|$|R
