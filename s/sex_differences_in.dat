Advancing age is a primary risk factor for the disease and incidence rates are not equal for all ages: every {{five years after the}} age of 65, the risk of acquiring the disease approximately doubles, increasing from 3 to as much as 69 per thousand person years. There are also <b>sex</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> the incidence rates, women having a higher risk of developing AD particularly in the population older than 85. The risk of dying from Alzheimer's disease is 26% higher among the non-Hispanic white population than among the non-Hispanic black population, whereas the Hispanic population has a 30% lower risk than the non-Hispanic white population.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Various {{studies have}} {{reported}} mixed results during their investigation of the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> jealousy. The debate rages as to whether men do in fact respond more jealous to sexual infidelity than emotional infidelity compared to women and whether women respond more jealous to emotional infidelity than sexual infidelity compared to men. This study examines {{the nature of the}} <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> jealousy with particular focus on three main issues: Firstly, whether the paradigm is simply an artefact of measurement. Secondly, whether the proposed <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> is mainly due to the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> emotional jealousy and thirdly, whether the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> jealousy is due to evolution. Method: We studied jealousy using the same group of participants, male (n = 56) and female (n = 65), on a variety of different measures including Schützwohl’s (2006) information search, Buss et al. ’s (1992) hypothetical dilemmas and Michalski, Shackelford and Salmon’s (2007) dilemmas involving siblings. The analysis of data included Chi Squares, t-tests and Analysis of Variance. Results: The <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> jealousy was apparent in measures other than the forced-choice, hypothetical dilemma measure and the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> for emotional jealousy survived on more measures than the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> for sexual jealousy. However, there was no effect found for sex of sibling but there was an effect found for sex of participant. Conclusions: Our results support the view that the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> jealousy is more to do with a <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> emotional jealousy due to a female sensitivity to emotional infidelity. <b>In</b> addition, the <b>sex</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> jealousy was not found to be an artefact of measurement. However, we found no evidence to support the evolutionary theory of jealousy due to the fact we did not find an effect for sex of sibling and also {{because of the lack of}} support for a mechanism to prevent cuckoldry (sexual jealousy) ...|$|R

25|$|Another set of {{significant}} physical changes during puberty happen in bodily distribution {{of fat and}} muscle. This process is different for females and males.

In contrast, though both sexes experience an increase in body fat, the increase is much more significant for girls. Frequently, the increase in fat for girls happens in their years just before puberty. The ratio between muscle and fat among post-pubertal boys is around three to one, while for girls it is about five to four.

40|$|It is well {{established}} that {{men are more likely}} than women to engage in direct competition, but it is unclear if this reflects social structural conditions or evolved predispositions.

Study 1 assessed participation and the occurrence of relatively fast performances by masters runners (40 – 74 years old) at recent road races and track meets.
