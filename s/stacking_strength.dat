40|$|In this thesis, {{we explore}} the phase {{behavior}} of discotic molecules in various circum-stances. We first study the thermodynamics of disk-coil molecules. The system shows rich phase {{behavior as a}} function of the relative attractive strength of coils (A), the <b>stacking</b> interaction <b>strength</b> of disks (p), the number of coarse-grained monomers of the coil (Nc), and the reduced temperature (T*). At high T*, a disordered phase is dominant. At intermediate T*, lamellar, perforated lamellar, and cylinder phases appear as y and Nc are increased. At low T*, disks crystallize into ordered lamellar, ordered perforated lamellar, and ordered cylinder phases. We find that the confine-ment imposed on the disks by the attached coils strongly contributes to the ordered stacking of the disks. In particular, the ordered cylinder phase contains highly ordered disks stacked in parallel due to the cylindrical confinement of the coils that restricts the system to a single degree of freedom associated with the director vector of the disks.

40|$|Nonequilibrium {{molecular}} dynamics (NEMD) simulations of shock waves in single crystals have shown that, above a threshold strength, strongly shocked crystals deform {{in a very}} simple way. Rather than experiencing massive deformation, a simple slippage occurs at the shock front, relieving the peak shear stress, and leaving behind a stacking fault. Later calculations quantified the apparent threshold strength, namely the yield strength of the perfect crystal. Subsequently, pulsed x-ray experiments on shocked single crystals showed relative shifts in diffraction peaks, confirming the authors NEMD observations of stacking faults produced by shockwave passage.

40|$|Three-dimensional {{design is}} central to all modern {{compressor}} design systems, {{but many of these}} methods still rely on a two-dimensional and sectional view of aerodynamics at their core. This paper argues that this view fundamentally limits design by not considering the effect, on separation and loss, of the pressure gradient {{on the surface of the}} blade perpendicular to the meridional direction, here known as the transverse pressure gradient. The first part of the paper details how altering the transverse pressure gradient, by changing a blade's 3 D stacking, switches the way in which the blade aerodynamically "fails," from a open corner separation to a trailing edge separation. It also shows how the transverse pressure gradient significantly changes the blade profile loss. In the second part, the effect of the transverse pressure gradient on the uncertainty inherent in the compressor design space is investigated. It is shown that as blade pitch-chord ratio is raised and the amount of 3 D stacking is lowered, the uncertainty of predicting a compressor's operating range is significantly raised. By increasing 3 D <b>stacking</b> and the <b>strength</b> of the transverse pressure gradient, it is shown that this uncertainty can be significantly reduced.

The system shows rich phase {{behavior as a}} function of the relative attractive strength of coils ([lambda]), the <b>stacking</b> interaction <b>strength</b> of disks ([mu]), the number of coarse-grained monomers of the coil (Nc), and the reduced temperature (T*). At high T*, a disordered phase is dominant. At intermediate T*, lamellar, perforated lamellar, and cylinder phases appear as y and Nc are increased. At low T*, disks crystallize into ordered lamellar, ordered perforated lamellar, and ordered cylinder phases. We find that the confinement imposed on the disks by the attached coils strongly contributes to the ordered stacking of the disks. In particular, the ordered cylinder phase contains highly ordered disks stacked in parallel due to the cylindrical confinement of the coils that restricts the system to a single degree of freedom associated with the director vector of the disks. Our results are important for understanding the self-assembly of supramolecular structures of disk-coil molecules that are ubiquitous in nature, such as chlorophyll molecules. Having established the importance of confinement on the phase behavior of discotic molecules, we next study blends of discotic molecules and block copolymers (BCPs) using self-consistent field theoretic simulations. In particular we explore systems containing a single sphere, rod, or discotic molecule confined within a BCP defect and systems containing multiple discotic molecules confined within BCP cylinders. In the former case, the sphere, rod, and discotic molecules are all trapped in the defect center where the cylinders of the surrounding BCPs make a junction. The director vector of the rod molecule aligns with the axial direction of one of the cylinders, while the director vector of the discotic molecule aligns perpendicular to the axes of all the cylinders. This preferential orientation is induced by the minimized stretching energy of the BCPs for these configurations. For the system with multiple discotic molecules confined within the BCP cylinders, all director vectors are aligned with the axial direction of the cylinder when the density of disks is high to minimize both the stretching energy of the BCPs and the polymer-mediated potential between the disks. These results provide design principles for next generation optoelectronic devices based on blends of discotic molecules and BCPs. by YongJoo Kim. Thesis (Ph. D.)

In this context, mitigation of air pollution due to thermal power plant emissions assumes special significance. The Neyveli Lignite Corporation (NLC) - Asia's largest Lignite based Thermal Power Plant took a visionary step in this regard, four decades ago, via a massive afforestation program involving 17 million evergreen trees. These trees, now fully grown, {{play an important role}} in abating air pollution in the NLC town ship which is home to 128, 133 people. This first study quantifies the cleansing action of these evergreens by employing a tailor-made atmospheric dispersion-deposition model which accounts for unique regional factors- the year round high solar insolation, high temperatures and the convective nature of the atmospheric boundary layer. We model the dispersion of SO 2 emitted from multiple elevated <b>stacks</b> (typical source <b>strengths</b> are 300 g/s) and its deposition onto the evergreen canopy. Deposition is quantified in terms of the universal deposition velocity parameterization via inferential-resistance modelling of the transport pathways. Results indicate that considerable amount of pollution is deposited onto the canopy year round. In addition active cleansing of the atmosphere takes place over regions not directly in the path of SO 2 emissions but nevertheless affected by residual pollution. This is relevant to large areas of NLC due to the wind pattern which involves a daily wind direction shift in the afternoon as well as several periods of calm.

We first introduce sequence-dependent thermodynamics into a previously developed coarse-grained rigid base-pair model of DNA. This model is then used to study sequence-dependent effects in multiple DNA systems including: the heterogeneous stacking transition of single strands, the fraying of a duplex, the effects of <b>stacking</b> <b>strength</b> in the loop on the melting temperature of hairpins, the force-extension curve of single strands, and the structure of a kissing-loop complex. We further apply the DNA model to study in detail the properties of an autonomous unidirectionally propagating DNA nanotechnological device, called the ``burnt bridges motor''. We then apply the coarse-graining methods developed for the DNA model to construct a new sequence-dependent coarse-grained model of RNA, which aims to capture basic thermodynamic, structural and mechanical properties of RNA molecules. We test the model by studying its thermodynamics for a variety of secondary structure motifs and also consider the force-extension properties of an RNA duplex. This RNA model allows for efficient simulations of a variety of RNA systems up to hundreds or even thousands of base-pairs.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{transportation}} means high and varying loads for products as well as packages. To develop corrugated boxes with optimal design and efficient use of raw materials is crucial. Vibrations and shocks acting on pallets during transportation are transferred to the corrugated boxes and considerably reduce the integrity and life time of the boxes. The development of experimental and analytical tools for measurement and prediction of the influence of dynamic loads on the box performance, such as <b>stacking</b> <b>strength</b> and conservation of stacking pattern would therefore be of large practical importance. In order to develop such tools, {{it is important to know}} the load distribution between different boxes. This master thesis presents a technique for investigating these stresses based on a pressure sensitive film, which gives many data points. A series of tests using random and sinusoidal vibration testing have been done utilising this technique and results are presented for different positions on the pallet and for different box filling methods. Investigations performed on the vibrations of the boxes also demonstrate a pitch type of motion. A level-crossing study on the forces existing between the boxes shows a Rayleigh force distribution. A mathematical model is also proposed for simulation of a stacking system. Advantages and disadvantages with this technique and with the model are described. Comparison between the experimental and numerical results shows a proper correlation. Using the pressure sensitive film as a quantitative sensor and applying the recorded data for the statistical study of the contact forces existing in a stack of boxes gives useful and important results for further analysis of the fatigue life and vulnerable positions of boxes. ...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 145 - 149). Corrugated {{board is}} a composite sandwich type material used in the packaging industry worldwide. In the design of corrugated boxes, the <b>stacking</b> <b>strength</b> is an important design parameter. Current research shows that box failure is inﬂuenced by the ﬂexural rigidities of the panel and its transverse shear rigidities. McKinlay proposed a new method to measure the MD transverse shear stiffness of corrugated board. This research was aimed at designing a ﬁxture to perform the MD shear test and to evaluate its performance. In addition, the properties that inﬂuence box strength were to be investigated. These properties were then {{to be used in}} improved box strength predictions. It was found that the designed MD shear ﬁxture was able to measure the transverse shear stiffness of corrugated board in the MD direction {{with a high degree of}} accuracy and reproducibility. This method was much easier to perform than the standard block shear test method and also much quicker. This was a very important factor considering the application of this testing method in a research and development environment. In addition, the stiffness test exhibited good possibilities for use as a quality control tool. Extensive testing showed that the material used in the manufacture of corrugated board had a strong inﬂuence on board and box strength. In addition, it was found that the separation of the faces in a corrugated board structure had an inﬂuence on the strength and stability of the box. Factors such as the manufacturing process and board structure were also found to have an effect on box strength. Box strength predictions were performed using the methods available in the literature. These predictions had good correlation with the experimental box compression values. It was shown that box strength can be accurately predicted from liner and ﬂuting properties and this capability is an important tool in box strength design...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The size distribution and strength of metallurgical coke are factors vital for the steady and high-efficiency operation of a blast furnace, since these factors govern <b>stack</b> penneability. Coke <b>strength</b> influences the size of lump coke {{not only because of}} size degradation by impact and abrasion during transfer to and descent in the blast furnace, but also because of its influence on the fracture which takes place in the coke layer during carbonisation and the effect this has on the initial mean size and size distribution of the feed coke. Therefore, the elucidation of the relationship between coke strength and the fissure fonnation phenomena is significant. In this study, therefore, the coke strength development during carbonisation has been examined in conjunction with various parameters, such as the degree of carbonisation of the coal, namely the extent or fraction of pyrolytic reaction, and the degree of graphitisation of the coke, as well as carbonisation temperature and heating regime. The porous structure of coke has also been examined with a view to establishing a relation between the porous structure and the coking properties of the coal carbonised. The quality of coke porous structure was evaluated by parameters introduced in this study, i. e., the pore size distribution and pore rugosity factors. A poor porous structure is shown to be associated with high proportion of small pores and pores with a rough surface. These features are considered to stem from poor coking properties and the consequent poor adhesion between coal particles. An attempt has also been made to establish a mathematical model capable of predicting the degree of fissuring of coke during carbonisation by utilising the understandings obtained in this study of the coke strength development during carbonisation and the effect of coal properties on coke strength. Coke samples large enough to facilitate the observation of the degree of fissuring in relation to various coal properties and heating conditions, were made to evaluate the mathematical model and introduce the concept. The concept that fissuring takes place when developing thennal stress exceeds the developing coke strength is demonstrated to be capable to evaluate the effects of coal properties and heating conditions on the degree of fissuring observed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of the Project This Master's project {{involved}} conceptualizing {{and writing}} a grant {{proposal for a}} model "Neighborhood Sustainability Corps" (NSC) program to be piloted in the Roseland area of Santa Rosa, California. The purpose of the NSC program is to create more sustainable communities by engaging intergenerational work teams (youth-at-risk and seniors) in neighborhood projects that address sustainability issues such as food security and resource efficiency, {{while at the same}} time helping to build social capital and serving basic needs through the use of TimeBanking. By focusing on youth-at-risk and providing mentorships for them with neighborhood adults (retirees and community elders) structured through TimeBanking with its co-production philosophy and "no-more-throwaway-people" approach (I need you and you need me, and everyone has something to contribute), the intention of the program is not only to build participants' practical skills and knowledge, but also to build social relationships, strengthen neighborhood bonds, and contribute to the community's overall physical and social resilience and adaptability in this time of increasing environmental, social, and economic crises. The Neighborhood Sustainability Corps pilot program will collaborate with and complement other community sustainability initiatives with the added emphasis on equity and social justice, complementary economies for meeting people's basic needs, and the increasingly important nurturance of healthy intergenerational relationships. Procedure I drew upon three main sources for the conceptualization and refinement of my idea for a Sustainability Corps program structured through TimeBanking: 1) the growing body of academic literature and practical applications found around the world regarding ecological design for sustainable communities; 2) my graduate coursework in environmental studies, agroecology, sociology, psychology, economics, public policy, and interdisciplinary studies; and, 3) key informants (professors, community leaders, and experts in the field). I identified potential funders for the pilot program, wrote a grant proposal, and collaborated with community leaders in the founding of a Sonoma County TimeBank. I will submit the proposal to potential funders to implement the program; document, evaluate, and refine it; distribute lessons-learned; and, if proven successful, scale it up and establish the model in other communities. Throughout the project I focused on, and will continue to emphasize, 1) relationship-building; 2) education and information sharing; 3) documenting and disseminating lessons-learned; 4) connecting with related agencies and initiatives; and, 5) actively encouraging and participating in the development of applicable public policy. Conclusions This Master's project is about cultivating applied hope-authentic, sleeves-rolled-up hope. Our ability as a species to be fully awake and to discern the reality of our global predicaments without being paralyzed by denial, guilt, apathy, or overwhelm is being put to the test. The convergence of mounting economic, social, and environmental crises is upon us, and empirical evidence points to unprecedented challenges ahead as we navigate the downhill side of fossil-fuel-based industrialization and corporate globalization with climate change, peak oil, failing economic paradigms, and severe societal strains. Yet we are an adaptive species. Our state of mind, what we focus on matters. It influences our ability to stay open, flexible, resilient. Where the mind goes, the energy flows. Therefore, let us realize that this is also a time of great opportunity. It is an opportunity to utilize wisdom, our intellectual and heart-felt intelligence, and to respond individually and collectively with creativity and courage. It is an opportunity, for example, to look to nature's intelligent design to see what ecology can teach us about creating sustainable communities, about not only enduring, but thriving. Ecological design principles-such as <b>stacking</b> functions, <b>strength</b> in diversity, resilience of webs, and there is no such thing as waste-can be applied to social, economic, and environmental problems. We are learning. for instance, that for sustainable development to be effective, it needs to address the grassroots as well as larger systemic levels such as economic structures. We are also learning that co-production is a powerful approach to mobilizing the social capital of communities to promote sustainability. Adaptive co-production, this emerging method for social-ecological learning and community development, is based on building trust through collaboration in resolving societal and environmental dilemmas. Weaving stronger webs of intergcnerational relations and co-productively making smallscale adaptive changes in homes and neighborhoods not only helps focus on something positive and proactive, but also helps improve lives in tangible ways. Gardening and the act of growing at least some of one's own food - in particular in cooperation with others - has been shown to not only improve food security and resource conservation, but also the social, psychological. intergenerational, and economic well-being of individuals and their communities. These are symbolic and practical steps towards creating a more viable future. We simply cannot afford not to act. As E. F. Schumacher articulated: Can we rely on it that a ???turning around??? will be accomplished by enough people quickly enough to save the modern world? This question is often asked, but no matter what the answer, it will mislead. The answer ???Yes??? would lead to complacency, the answer ???No??? to despair.
