This paper presents the bending analysis of a three phase composite plate with an epoxy matrix, reinforced glass fiber and titanium oxide particles including creep effect when shear stress is taken into account.

To {{elucidate}} sonographic {{characteristics of}} common carotid arteries in adolescents with {{type 1 diabetes}} mellitus (DM 1) depending on {{the duration of the}} disease and the presence of chronic complications. Materials and methods. A total of 56 adolescents having DM 1 of different duration were examined to evaluate conditions of common carotid arteries (CA) in the systole and diastole during at least 3 cardiac cycles. The following parameters were measured: CA diameter, intima-media thickness (IMT), estimated stretch and stiffness coefficients, Youngs modulus. The control group comprised 16 healthy adolescents. Results. Bilateral increase of IMT was recorded in patients with DM duration over 5 years. Youngs modulus, stretch and stiffness coefficients were virtually unrelated to disease duration. In patients having DM for more than 10 years, <b>stretch</b> <b>coefficient</b> was 5. 38 (95 % DI 4. 82 - 5. 8) compared with 5. 82 (95 % DI 5. 63 - 7. 38) in those with DM for less than 3 years (p = 0. 04). The level of albuminuria correlated with IMT (r= 0. 32, p= 0. 03), stiffness coefficient (r = 0. 43, p= 0. 001), <b>stretch</b> <b>coefficient</b> (r= - 0. 48, p< 0. 001), and Young modulus (r= 0. 32, p= 0. 002). Dyslipidemia occurred almost in half of the patients with DM duration over 5 years. In patients with hyperlipidemia, IMT was significantly higher than in patients with normolipidemia (0. 58 and 0. 5 mm respectively, p= 0. 013). IMT also increased in case of distal neuropathy. Conclusion. Examination of CA revealed enhanced IMT in adolescents with DM 1 over 5 years, dyslipidemia, proteinuric nephropathy, and distal neuropathy.

40|$|The astounding {{discovery}} of a universe expanding with positive acceleration, has called {{for the existence of}} a hypothetical new constitute of the universe tagged as dark energy. Even though the positive acceleration of the cosmos has been confirmed, questions regarding the nature of this new constitute remain unanswered. The first signatures of this sensational discovery were initially revealed by the Hubble diagram constructed by a sample of Type Ia supernovae with redshifts predominantly smaller than 1 (z < 1). However in order to comprehend the features of dark energy information regarding the behavior of the Hubble curve at redshifts lower than 0. 1 and higher than 1 are needed. Type Ia supernovae with a redshift lower than 0. 1 (z< 0. 1) are relatively observed less in compare to supernovae with redshift 0. 1 < z < 1. In order {{to understand the nature of}} dark energy different surveys have been constructing the Hubble diagram for Type Ia’s with z< 0. 1. Members of Yale’s La Silla-Quest Survey (LSQ) has been actively involved in discovering and constructing photometric light curves from a large sample of low redshift Type Ia supernovae (z< 0. 1). The supernovae of this sample were initially discovered through exploiting the 10 square degree QUEST camera installed on the ESO Schmidt telescope located at the La Silla Observatory Chile. In order to generate photometric light curves the Carnegie Supernova Project II (CSP) and the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network (LCOGT) continuously observed these objects and produced a precious data set for 46 Type Ia supernovae. In this thesis I go through the methods and analyses that resulted in the construction of light curves for LSQ’s sample of Type Ia supernovae. I also discuss using the SALT 2. 4 supernova light curve fitter for analyzing the photometric data and building the Hubble diagram for our sample. The results of SALT 2. 4 analysis gives us an intrinsic spread of 14 %, an absolute B band magnitude of - 19. 086, a <b>stretch</b> <b>coefficient</b> of 0. 114, and a color correction of 2. 436, which are consistent with other photometric supernovae samples.

We first calculate 24 reference CCFs by averaging the CCFs separately as a function of local hour over the whole acquisition period. Then, for each local hour, we estimate how the coda computed over a 30 -day sliding window resembles its reference CCF. Finally, for each local hour, we obtain a set of <b>stretching</b> <b>coefficients</b> (SCs) and their corresponding correlation coefficients (CCs). Medians and standard deviations of the CCs are used as indicators of coda repeatability (for instance, a value of 100 %[*]±[*] 0 % would correspond to a coda that always matches its reference whatever the position of the 30 -day window).

40|$|The coil-stretch {{transition}} in extensional flows of viscoelastic dilute polymer solutions {{is known to}} be associated with a strong hysteresis in molecular conformations and rheo-optical properties. At infinite dilution, hysteresis is caused by the large difference in frictional drag coefficient between undeformed isotropic polymer coils and highly stretched conformations. At the low extension rates in the hysteresis regime, stretched molecules pervade larger volumes than equilibrium coils since the flow is too weak to suppress transverse fluctuations. The onset of intermolecular overlap occurs for such stretched conformations at polymer concentrations much smaller than c*, the conventional critical overlap concentration for equilibrium coils. Therefore, for a range of concentrations c < c*, intramolecular hydrodynamic interactions may be significantly screened in stretched conformations. Scaling arguments based on "blob" concepts are used here to argue that the <b>stretched</b> state drag <b>coefficient</b> can grow strongly with concentration in the dilute regime. A dumbbell model with conformation-dependent drag model is used to predict a concomitant strong enhancement of coil-stretch hysteresis with increasing concentration in the dilute regime. This extensional flow induced self-concentration leads to a maximum in hysteretic effects around c*, which progressively diminish in the semi-dilute regime where screening in isotropic coils reduces the difference in drag <b>coefficient</b> between <b>stretched</b> and coiled states.

Comparisons of platform motions and structural responses in the wind turbine are shown for simulations for a model with linear potential ﬂow solution and quadratic drag and simulations with only Morison-type forces. The SSWT modelled {{in this study is}} based on WindFloat and carries the NREL 5 MW wind turbine and should be considered a large volume structure. This implies that diffraction effects should be considered by using potential ﬂow theory and viscous effects by Morison's equation. A new coupled simulation code was developed by linking the SIMO and RIFLEX hydrodynamic, structural, and control system computational tools, from MARINTEK, with the aerodynamic forces and wind ﬁeld generation capabili–ties of AeroDyn and TurbSim, from NREL. In contrast to other available simulation codes, this combination enabled the implementation of these two different hydrodynamic theories and offered the possibility of ﬁnite element mooring line models.

40|$|Although the {{analysis}} of observational data indicates that quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) have {{to play an important}} role in magnetic configurations of solar flares, the corresponding theory is only at an initial stage so far. In particular, there is still a need in a proper definition of QSL. This problem is analyzed here on the basis of geometrical properties of the mapping produced by the field lines which connect photospheric areas of positive and negative magnetic polarities of active regions. In general, one can find on the photosphere a unique pair of locally perpendicular line elements at one footpoint of a given field line, so that this pair is mapped into a similar pair of elements at the other footpoint. Along the directions of these elements the field line mapping only stretches and compresses the corresponding displacements of the neighboring field-line footpoints. This fact enables us to get a remarkably clear and concise definition of QSL as a volume filled by coronal field lines for which the ratio of the corresponding <b>stretching</b> and compressing <b>coefficients</b> is anomalously large. The new definition is also compared with the ones previously introduced by other authors. The theory is applied to flare events of the so-called sigmoid-type, using an analytical model of a twisted force-free configuration. It is shown that such a configuration may contain a QSL even if genuine separatrix surfaces are absent. Identifying QSLs is an essential prerequisite for understanding the mechanism of magnetic energy release in this type of flares. It is also demonstrated that the magnetic field under study has a Hamiltonian structure, which makes it possible to reveal a geometrical reason for the appearance of QSL in this case.

40|$|Seven {{different}} triple sum formulas for 9 j {{coefficients of}} the quantum algebra u_q(2) are derived, using for these purposes the usual expansion of q- 9 j coefficients {{in terms of}} q- 6 j coefficients and recent summation formula of twisted q-factorial series (resembling the very well-poised basic hypergeometric _ 5 ϕ_ 4 series) as a q-generalization of Dougall's summation formula of the very well-poised hypergeometric _ 4 F_ 3 (- 1) series. This way for q= 1 the new proof of the known triple sum formula is proposed, as well as six new triple sum formulas for 9 j coefficients of the SU(2) group, in the angular momentum theory. The mutual rearrangement possibilities of the derived triple sum formulas {{by means of the}} Chu [...] Vandermonde summation formulas are considered and applied to derive several versions of double sum formulas for the stretched q- 9 j coefficients, which give new rearrangement and summation formulas of special Kampé de Fériet functions and their q-generalizations. Several fourfold sum formulas [with each sum of the _ 5 F_ 4 (1) or _ 5 ϕ_ 4 type] for the 12 j coefficients of the second kind (without braiding) of the SU(2) and u_q(2) are proposed, as well as expressions with five sums [of the _ 4 F_ 3 (1) and _ 3 F_ 2 (1) or _ 4 ϕ_ 3 and _ 3 ϕ_ 2 type] for the 12 j coefficients of the first kind (with braiding) instead of the usual expansion in terms of q- 6 j <b>coefficients.</b> <b>Stretched</b> and doubly stretched q- 12 j coefficients [as triple, double or single sums, related to composed or separate hypergeometric _ 4 F_ 3 (1) and _ 5 F_ 4 (1) or _ 4 ϕ_ 3 and _ 5 ϕ_ 4 series, respectively] are considered.

40|$|State-of-the-art {{capacitance}} extraction {{methods for}} Integrated Circuits (IC) involve scanning 2 D cross-sections, and interpolating 2 D capacitance values using a table lookup approach. This approach is fast and accurate {{for a large}} percentage of IC wires. It is however quite inaccurate for full 3 D structures, such as crossing wires in adjacent metal layers. For such cases electrostatic field solvers are required. Unfortunately standard field solvers are inherently very time-consuming, making them completely impractical in typical IC design flows. Even fast matrix-vector product approaches (e. g., fastmultipole or precorrected FFT) are inefficient for these structures since they have a significant computational overhead and scale linearly with the number of conductors only for much larger structures with more than several hundreds of wires. In this talk we present therefore a new 3 D extraction field solver that is extremely efficient in particular for the smaller scale extraction problem involving the ten to one hundred conductors in the 3 D structures that cannot be handled by the 2 D scanning and table look up approach. Because of highly restrictive design rules of the recent sub-micro to nano-scale IC technologies, smooth and regular charge distributions extracted from simple model structures can be stored beforehand as "templates" and instantiated and stretched to fit practical complicated cases as basis function building blocks. This "template-instantiated" strategy largely reduces the number of unknowns and computational time without additional overhead. Given that all basis functions are obtained by the same very few <b>stretched</b> templates, Galerkin <b>coefficients</b> can be readily computed from a mixture of analytical, numerical and table lookup approaches. Furthermore, given the low accuracy (i. e., 3 %- 5 %) required by IC extraction and the specific aspect ratios and separations of wires on ICs, we have observed in our numerical experimentations that edge and corner charge singularities {{do not need to be}} included in our templates, hence reducing the complexity of our solver even further. by Yu-Chung Hsiao.
