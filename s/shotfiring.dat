500|$|Francis Taylor is {{the first}} {{recorded}} fatality at the colliery, killed by a roof fall at [...] "Bradford coal pitt" [...] in 1622. Although the mines were relatively gas-free, there were nevertheless some gas-related incidents. One collier, working {{by the light of}} a candle in 1874, died from burns received in an explosion of firedamp. In 1907 a miner died in a <b>shotfiring</b> incident, when gas exploded as a fuse was lit. In 1924 a number of tubs transporting miners being hauled to the surface derailed and dislodged a pit prop, causing a roof collapse, known locally as a crump; three men were killed and nine injured. The heat from a fire in the main winding engine house in 1953 caused the winding cables to snap, sending two coal-carrying cages crashing {{to the bottom of the}} main shaft and trapping 350men underground. All managed to reach a smaller shaft [...] away and were subsequently brought safely to the surface.|$|E

5000|$|Induction <b>shotfiring</b> - using {{a charge}} (explosive) {{to test the}} face and induce an {{outburst}} if one is imminent. The explosion would {{have the effect of}} fracturing the face and relieving the stress on the face, transferring it deeper into the seam.|$|E
50|$|The miners' legal representatives {{presented}} theories at {{the inquiry}} as to {{cause of the}} explosion. Cripps said he believed an explosion was triggered down near the 95's by <b>shotfiring</b> near a main airway. The blast had ignited a pocket of firedamp which had accumulated in the drift because of inadequate ventilation and the lax attitude of the mine owners to monitoring gas levels, contrary to Section 29 of the Coal Mines Act 1911.|$|E
50|$|In 1937 {{the inquiry}} {{published}} its findings. Despite considering management failures, {{a lack of}} safety measures, bad working practices and poor ventilation in the pit, Walker drew very cautious conclusions about the cause in his final verdict. This was largely because the two assessors chosen by the miners and by the pit's management, and the barristers representing them, had given widely different suggestions as {{to the source of}} the explosion; though Walker suggested that Cripps's theory regarding <b>shotfiring</b> in 95's appeared the most likely cause.|$|E
50|$|The {{colliery}} was reopened {{within two}} weeks of the explosion, and an inquest opened in Pontypridd in August 1894. The differences of opinion between the owners, the inspectors and the professional witnesses led the jury to conclude that the explosion of gas was accelerated by coal dust, but it failed to agree on the cause. Because of this, the inquest lasted 9 days before it reached this conclusion. They did unanimously agree that <b>shotfiring</b> without sufficient precautions and contrary to the rules meant that that under manager had neglected his duties. The jury made recommendations to improve safety conditions. These recommendations included that <b>shotfiring</b> in timber should be prohibited, old working should be properly stowed and that the number of men in the mines should be kept at all times. The jury also suggested that more thorough inspections should be carried out and that they should be carried out by Her Majesty's inspectors as the present workmen representatives were deemed worthless. The inspectors responded by saying that apart from disagreeing on the origin of the explosion, their view were in accord with the jury. The inspectors insisted however that the inspections were not worthless or useless and were in fact a good thing when carried out properly, like they generally are carried out in South Wales and Monmouthshire. One of the few survivors, George Bamford, gave his account of the explosion to help the inquest.|$|E

50|$|Subsequent to the {{accident}} {{a number of}} theories were advanced in the Report as to the explosion's exact cause: Sir Stafford Cripps, the miners' legal representative, suggested that an explosion had been triggered in 95's by <b>shotfiring</b> (the firing of explosive charges) near a main airway. The miners' appointed Assessor also surmised that a large quantity of gas had accumulated {{at the top of}} the face in 14's district, which was then ignited by an accident with a safety lamp or by a spark from a coalcutter. The legal representatives of the pit's management, however, suggested that firedamp had accumulated in the main Dennis haulage road beyond the Clutch (a junction on the main drift where the underground haulage machinery was located) and which was ignited at the Clutch when a telephone was used to warn miners of the influx of gas. This interpretation sought to deny that poor working practices were the ultimate cause of the disaster.|$|E
5000|$|The {{disaster}} inquiry {{was told}} {{that one of the}} pit deputies (whose job was in theory to oversee the safety of the workings) admitted that he also carried out <b>shotfiring</b> during his shifts, in addition to his other duties. It was revealed that he fired more charges during his shift than a full-time shotfirer could have safely carried out. Furthermore, the colliery had made an operating loss in 1933, and the pit manager, William Bonsall, had been under pressure from the Dennis family to increase profitability. Bonsall was not a trained mining engineer and at Gresford the role of mine agent, which would normally be held by a technically experienced person with authority to stand up to both manager and owners, had not been filled for some time since the previous agent's retirement. Bonsall admitted he had spent little time in the Dennis section of the pit in the months before the disaster, as he was overseeing the installation of new machinery in the [...] "Slant", an area in the south-eastern part of the mine's Martin section. Work on improving the Dennis section ventilation had been halted, and the inquiry's chair later confessed to [...] "an uneasy feeling that Mr. Bonsall was overridden" [...] on the matter.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Five {{hundred and}} sixty British coalminers with {{relatively}} high or relatively low expo-sures to oxides of nitrogen, based on measurements of concentrations of these gases at nine collieries over four years, and records of the men's places of work and colliery mining conditions over a total of eight years have been studied. Data on these men's respiratory symptoms and ventilatory capacity (FEVy), obtained {{as part of an}} epidemiological study of British coalminers, have been used to investigate possible adverse effects of exposure to oxides of nitrogen. Expo-sures to oxides of nitrogen were generally well below threshold limit values, though occasional peaks after <b>shotfiring</b> and during diesel locomotive use did exceed short term limits. No relation-ship was found between exposure and respiratory symptoms or decline in FEV, nor was there any evidence of differences in symptoms or FEV, between 44 pairs of men matched for age, dust exposure, smoking habit, coal rank, and type of work, but differing in respect of exposure to oxides of nitrogen. It has not been possible to detect any adverse effects on the health of this working population of the levels of nitrogen oxides that have occurred in British mines over the past decade. With the current levels of these gases, any long term effects on respiratory health are so small as to be undetectable in the presence of smoking and dust exposure...|$|E
