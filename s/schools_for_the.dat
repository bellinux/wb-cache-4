5|$|On September 29, 1870, the institute, {{which was}} later {{known as the}} West Virginia <b>Schools</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Deaf and Blind, opened its doors in the old Romney Classical Institute {{building}} with 25 deaf and five blind students. Following its disestablishment in 1916, the adjacent Potomac Academy (formerly Potomac Seminary) grounds were also incorporated into {{the campus of the}} <b>Schools</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Deaf and Blind.|$|E
5|$|The {{institute}} {{and the society}} experienced a hiatus {{during the course of}} the war. The school held sessions under Reverend Nelson, and subsequently William C. Clayton in 1866. Clayton later served in the West Virginia Senate. The Romney Literary Society was revived in 1869, and following the passage of a bill which established the West Virginia <b>Schools</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Deaf and Blind in March 1870, the society offered the institute's building and grounds to the state of West Virginia for the new school. The institute's property was transferred to the state and the West Virginia <b>Schools</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Deaf and Blind opened for its first term on September 29, 1870. Following the schools' subsequent expansions, the institute's former building became the center portion of the administration building of the West Virginia <b>Schools</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Deaf and Blind, in which capacity it serves at the present day. In addition to Jacob and Clayton, Robert White, Attorney General of West Virginia, was also an alumnus of the institute.|$|E
5|$|Although the Ayyubids {{were from}} the Shafi'i denomination, they built schools for imparting {{instruction}} in {{all four of the}} Sunni systems of religious-juridical thought. Before the Ayyubid takeover, there were no <b>schools</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Hanbali and Maliki denominations in Syria, but the Ayyubids founded separate schools for them. In the mid-13th century, Ibn Shaddad counted in Damascus 40 Shafi'i, 34 Hanafi, 10 Hanbali, and three Maliki schools.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} arrival of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's South Branch line to Romney in the 1880s, a {{passenger}} train conducted three trips daily (morning, noon, and evening) from the Romney Depot at Valley to Green Spring on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's main line. During the 1930s, passenger ridership on the South Branch line began to decline, and passenger service was finally discontinued shortly thereafter. A special passenger train carried students of the West Virginia <b>Schools</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Deaf and Blind, arriving at Romney Depot in Valley in the fall, and departing in the spring to take the students home. The last special train to transport the students of the West Virginia <b>Schools</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Deaf and Blind departed Romney Depot in the spring of 1941. Freight operations from Romney Depot later ceased, and the station was closed and demolished soon after.|$|E

5|$|Criticising {{mainstream}} Western {{education as}} counterproductive to {{the ethos of}} the movement, many New Age groups have established their own <b>schools</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> education of children, although in other cases such groups have sought to introduce New Age spiritual techniques into pre-existing establishments.|$|E

5|$|Howard Hille Johnson (February 19, 1846– February 8, 1913) was a blind American {{educator}} and {{writer in the}} states of Virginia and West Virginia.

While the Board of Regents was pleased with Gilkeson's performance as principal and wished for him to stay on in the position, but he preferred {{to return to his}} professional law and political career in the end.|$|E
5|$|More <b>schools</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> deaf {{were founded}} after ASD, and {{knowledge}} of ASL spread to these schools. In addition, the rise of Deaf community organizations bolstered the continued use of ASL. Societies such as the National Association of the Deaf and the National Fraternal Society of the Deaf held national conventions that attracted signers from across the country. This all contributed to ASL's wide use over a large geographical area, atypical of a sign language.|$|E

5|$|ASL {{originated}} in the early 19th century in the American School for the Deaf (ASD) in Hartford, Connecticut, from a situation of language contact. Since then, ASL use has propagated widely via <b>schools</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> deaf and Deaf community organizations. Despite its wide use, no accurate count of ASL users has been taken, though reliable estimates for American ASL users range from 250,000 to 500,000 persons, including a number of children of deaf adults. ASL users face stigma due to beliefs in the superiority of oral language to sign language, {{compounded by the fact}} that ASL is often glossed in English due to the lack of a standard writing system.|$|E
