40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} vacant parking slot {{detection}} and tracking system that fuses the sensors of an Around View Monitor (AVM) system and an ultrasonic sensor-based automatic parking system. The proposed system {{consists of three}} stages: parking <b>slot</b> <b>marking</b> detection, parking <b>slot</b> occupancy classifica-tion, and parking <b>slot</b> <b>marking</b> tracking. The parking <b>slot</b> <b>marking</b> detection stage recognizes various types of parking slot markings using AVM image sequences. It detects parking slots in individual AVM images by exploiting a hierarchical tree structure of park-ing slot markings and combines sequential detection results. The parking slot occupancy classification stage identifies vacancies of detected parking slots using ultrasonic sensor data. Parking slot occupancy is probabilistically calculated by treating each parking slot region as a single cell of the occupancy grid. The parking <b>slot</b> <b>marking</b> tracking stage continuously estimates {{the position of the}} selected parking slot while the ego-vehicle is moving into it. During tracking, AVM images and motion sensor-based odometry are fused together in the chamfer score level to achieve robustness against inevitable occlusions caused by the ego-vehicle. In the experiments, it is shown that the proposed method can recognize the positions and occupancies of various types of parking slot markings and stably track them under practical situations in a real-time manner. The proposed system is expected to help drivers conveniently select one of the available parking slots and support the parking control system by continuously updating the designated target positions.

40|$|Abstract—Automatic parking systems {{consist of}} three core technologies: 1) target {{position}} designation; 2) path planning; and 3) path tracking. Target position-designation methods {{can be divided}} into four categories: 1) user-interface based; 2) parking <b>slot</b> <b>marking</b> based; 3) free-space based; and 4) infrastructure based. Considering the fact that parking-assist systems are expected to be used mainly in urban situations, recognition of parking slot markings could be the most economical and efficient solution for target position designation. This paper proposes a semiautomatic parking slot marking-based target position-designation method. The user can initiate parking <b>slot</b> <b>marking</b> recognition by placing a finger {{on each side of the}} entrance of the target parking slot. With such a user interface, these systems can reduce the search range to so small an area that computational loads and false-recognition rates are significantly reduced. Furthermore, by identifying the junction patterns of parking slot markings around the designated point with a neural network-based classifier, the user can establish the target position with a uniform user interface. The proposed system showed a 91. 10 % recognition rate in 191 test cases consisting of five different types of parking slot markings.

40|$|Abstract. A full-automatic {{method for}} {{recognizing}} parking slot markings is proposed. The proposed method recognizes {{various types of}} parking slot markings by modeling them as a hierarchical tree structure. This method mainly consists of two processes: bottom-up and top-down. First, the bottom-up process climbs up the hierarchical tree structure to excessively generate parking slot candidates {{so as not to}} lose the correct slots. This process includes corner detection, junction and slot generation, and type selection procedures. After that, the top-down process confirms the final parking slots by eliminating falsely generated slots, junctions, and corners based on the properties of the parking <b>slot</b> <b>marking</b> type by climbing down the hierarchical tree structure. The proposed method was evaluated in 608 real-world parking situations encompassing a variety of different parking slot markings. The experimental result reveals that the proposed method outperforms the previous semiautomatic method while requiring a small amount of computational costs even though it is fully automatic. © 2013 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) [DOI: 10. 1117 / 1.

IPAS generates an optimal path to reach the designated target position. During parking operations, IPAS estimates ego-vehicle pose using ESP (Electric Stability Program) sensors such as wheel speed sensors, braking pedal switch and steering angle sensor. IPAS automatically controls braking and steering to achieve planned trajectory by sending required actuations to ESP and EPS (Electric Power Steering) via CAN. Furthermore, IPAS informs driver of the on-going parking operation by showing estimated trajectory on the rear view image. Proposed system is validated by vehicle experiments...|$|R

40|$|Queueing {{systems with}} batch service have been {{investigated}} extensively during the past decades. However, nearly all the studied models share the common feature that an uncorrelated arrival process is considered, which is unrealistic in several real-life situations. In this paper, we study a discrete-time queueing model, with a server that only initiates service when the amount of customers in system (system content) reaches or exceeds a threshold. Correlation is taken into account by assuming a discrete batch Markovian arrival process (D-BMAP), i. e. {{the distribution of the}} number of customer arrivals per slot depends on a background state which is determined by a first-order Markov chain. We deduce the probability generating function of the system content at random <b>slot</b> <b>marks</b> and we examine the influence of correlation in the arrival process on the behavior of the system.

Around 20 - 25 activity episodes, on average, are usually regarded as a reasonable value for the indicator.

40|$|Any {{language}} {{will have}} a range of predicates that specify three core participants (e. g. 'put', 'show', 'give'), and will conventionally provide a range of constructional types for the expression of these three participants in a structured single-clause or single-sentence event description. This article examines the clausal encoding of three-participant events in Lao, a Tai language of Southeast Asia. There is no possibility in Lao for expression of three full arguments in the core of a single-verb clause (although it is possible to have a third argument in a noncore <b>slot,</b> <b>marked</b> as oblique with a prepositionlike element). Available alternatives include extraposing an argument using a topic-comment construction, incorporating an argument into the verb phrase, and ellipsing one or more contextually retrievable arguments. A more common strategy is verb serialization, for example, where a threeplace verb (e. g. 'put') is assisted by an additional verb (typically a verb of handling such as 'carry') that provides a slot for the theme argument (e. g. the transferred object in a putting scene). The event construal encoded by this type of structure decomposes the event into a first stage in which the agent comes into control over a theme, and a second in which the agent performs a controlled action (e. g. of transfer) with respect to that theme and a goal (and/or source). The particular set of strategies that Lao offers for encoding three-participant events — notably, topic-comment strategy, ellipsis strategy, serial verb strategy — conform with (and are presumably motivated by) the general typological profile of the language. The typological features of Lao are typical for the mainland Southeast Asia area (isolating, topic-prominent, verb-serializing, widespread nominal ellipsis) ...|$|R
