25|$|Early in {{the second}} quarter, Woodley was {{replaced}} by Don <b>Strock</b> who started off his first play with a 17-yard completion to Duriel Harris on a drive that Uwe von Schamann finished with a 34-yard field goal. Miami's defense subsequently recovered a fumble from Fouts, giving their offense {{the ball on the}} Chargers 39-yard line, and <b>Strock</b> took advantage, leading them to score on his 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Joe Rose. Later on, Benirschke missed a 55-yard field goal attempt, giving Miami the ball with good field position. Three plays later from the 40-yard line, <b>Strock</b> took the snap and threw a pass intended for Harris at the 20-yard line. Harris caught the ball and immediately lateraled it to Tony Nathan, who then took it 25 yards to the end zone as time expired in the half, cutting the deficit to 24–17.|$|E

25|$|On {{the second}} {{play of the}} game, Browns {{defensive}} back Felix Wright intercepted a pass from Warren Moon and returned it 13 yards {{to set up a}} 33-yard field goal by Matt Bahr. Houston responded with a 91-yard drive that consumed 9:44 and ended on Moon's 14-yard touchdown pass to running back Allen Pinkett. Then on the first play of Cleveland's next drive, Browns quarterback Don <b>Strock,</b> who was filling in for the injured Bernie Kosar and starting in a playoff game {{for the first time in}} his 16-season career, fumbled a snap and Oilers defensive lineman Richard Byrd recovered the ball. <b>Strock</b> sprained his wrist while going after the ball on the play, and was replaced by third-string quarterback Mike Pagel. Meanwhile, Houston scored on their first play after the turnover with Pinkett's 16-yard touchdown run, making the score 14–3. They had a chance to score again near the end of the half, but Wright picked off Moon's pass in the end zone.|$|E
25|$|After the Crimson Tide {{extended}} their lead on a one-yard Steve Bisceglia touchdown {{run in the}} third, the Hokies scored their first points on a five-yard J. B. Barber touchdown run that made the score 38–6. The game concluded after both teams traded touchdowns in the final quarter. After Gary Rutledge scored for Alabama with his one-yard run, Don <b>Strock</b> threw a ten-yard touchdown pass to Craig Valentine. The Crimson Tide then made the final score 52–13 after Robert Farley threw a 21-yard touchdown pass to Pete Pappas late in the fourth quarter. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against Virginia Tech to 7–0.|$|E

25|$|In 1963, Lunsford {{was cast}} in Herbert L. <b>Strock's</b> horror film, The Crawling Hand. Lunsford made her last screen {{appearance}} in 1969, although she still appears at various public celebrity-oriented events.|$|R
25|$|<b>Strock</b> {{turned in}} the best game of his life, {{completing}} 29 of 43 passes for 403 yards and four touchdowns, while Fouts put {{on one of the}} best performances of his Hall of Fame career, completing 33 of 53 passes for 433 yards and three touchdowns. Harris caught six passes for 106 yards. Nathan rushed for 48 yards, caught nine passes for 114 yards, and scored two touchdowns. Muncie rushed for 124 yards and a touchdown. In addition to his 56-yard punt return touchdown, Chandler caught six passes for 106 yards. Brooks recorded 143 all-purpose yards. The image of an exhausted Winslow, who finished the game with 13 receptions for 166 yards and a touchdown, being helped off the field by two of his Chargers teammates is now an iconic visual of NFL Films.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} quarter, Miami drove 74 yards {{and tied it}} at 24, with Strock's 15-yard {{touchdown}} completion to Rose. San Diego countered with a 6-play, 60-yard drive to score on Fouts' 25-yard touchdown completion to tight end Kellen Winslow. But Miami re-tied the game with <b>Strock</b> completing six consecutive passes, the last a 50-yard score to Bruce Hardy. Then Miami defensive back Lyle Blackwood's interception set up a 12-yard touchdown run by Nathan, giving Miami their first lead of the game, 38–31, on the first play of the fourth quarter. Later on, with Miami just trying to maintain their lead and run out the clock, Chargers safety Pete Shaw recovered a fumble from Andra Franklin on San Diego's 18-yard line with 4:39 left in regulation. Fouts then led his team down to Miami's nine-yard line. With only 58 {{seconds left in the}} game, a heavy Dolphins pass rush forced Fouts to throw a blind pass intended for Winslow in the end zone. The pass sailed over Winslow's head, but went right into the arms of Brooks for a touchdown to tie the game.|$|E

Also in football, Florida Atlantic challenges its rival Florida International (FIU) is the annual Shula Bowl. This intercollegiate football game is named after legendary coach Don Shula; so named {{because at the time}} of its inception, both head coaches, Florida Atlantic's Howard Schnellenberger and Florida International coach Don <b>Strock,</b> had worked under Shula at some point during their careers. Even though both universities have since moved on to new head coaches, the Shula Bowl is still played. As a home game, the competition takes place at university's own stadium; as an away game, the bowl is played at FIU Stadium in Miami.|$|E

50|$|The {{following}} season, Woodley {{lost his}} starting spot to rookie Dan Marino. Woodley {{was traded to}} the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1984 and spent the rest of his career as a backup before retiring after the 1985 season. Don <b>Strock's</b> incredible performance in the Epic in Miami ended up being the main highlight of his career. He spent the rest of his career as a backup and retired after 1988 as a backup for the Cleveland Browns.|$|R
500|$|The 1988 {{season was}} marred by {{injuries}} to the Browns' quarterbacks. Kosar was injured in the opener against Kansas City Chiefs and two backups were subsequently injured, leaving Don <b>Strock,</b> who the Browns signed as an emergency fill-in, to start before Kosar's return. Kosar came back but was hurt again {{at the end of}} the regular season. Despite the rotating cast of quarterbacks, Cleveland managed to finish with a 10–6 record and made the playoffs as a wild-card team. Cleveland met the Houston Oilers in the wild-card playoff round at home, but lost the game 24–23. Four days after the Oilers loss, Schottenheimer and Modell announced that the coach would leave the team by mutual consent. Modell felt hiring an offensive coordinator was necessary to keep pace with the Oilers and the Bengals, a pair of divisional opponents then on the rise, but Schottenheimer said it [...] "became evident that some of the differences we had, we weren't going to be able to resolve." [...] Modell named Bud Carson as his replacement.|$|E
2500|$|This was {{the final}} NFL game for Csonka, {{as well as the}} final playoff game for Griese, who {{completed}} just 14 of 26 passes for 118 yards and was sacked 8 times before being replaced by Don <b>Strock</b> with 8:55 left in the fourth quarter.

5000|$|The {{editor of}} the Christian Science Monitor felt that the {{government}} rules to [...] "hold back and play down American casualties" [...] gave the American public an artificially optimistic view of the war's progress. In Australia, General Douglas MacArthur threatened to court-martial any soldier who gave a correspondent an interview without official permission. Life Washington correspondent Cal Whipple felt that <b>Strock’s</b> photograph was needed to inject a dose of reality {{on the home front}} who he thought were growing complacent about the war effort. Whipple said, “I went from army captain to major to colonel to general, until I wound up in the office of an Assistant Secretary of the Air Corps, who decided, ‘This has to go to the White House.’” Elmer Davis, Director of the Office of War Information, believed that the American public [...] "had a right to be truthfully informed" [...] about the war within the dictates of military security. Davis asked President Roosevelt to lift the ban on publishing photographs of dead American soldiers on the battlefield. Roosevelt agreed and authorized publication of <b>Strock's</b> image and others. Censorship was loosened, but the media was still forbidden from showing the faces of the dead or the insignia of the units they belonged to.|$|R
2500|$|Miami {{took over}} {{on their own}} 40-yard line {{following}} Benirschke's squib kick, needing only a field goal to win. Following an incomplete pass, <b>Strock's</b> next throw was intercepted by Willie Buchanon, but as he made the diving catch, he fumbled the ball back to Miami when he hit the ground. After that, Nathan's 17-yard reception and Tommy Vigorito's 6-yard run moved the Dolphins to the Chargers 26-yard line where von Schamann attempted a 43-yard field goal, {{but at the last}} second, Winslow extended his 6'5" [...] frame at the line just enough to deflect the kick with his fingers, causing it to fall short of the goal posts and sending the game into overtime.|$|R
2500|$|The {{incident}} was instantly condemned by all sides.

40|$|Finishing cattle {{performance}} and mass balance was evaluated with Micro-Aid was fed in diets containing wet distillers grains plus solubles (WDGS) at 35 % (DM basis). Micro-Aid is a feed ingredient {{derived from a}} Yucca extract which contains saponins, and {{was included in the}} treatment diet at 1 g/hd daily in the supplement. There was no difference in {{performance and}} carcass characteristics between treatments. In the winter experiment, cattle fed Micro-Aid had a greater amount of OM and DM removed from the pen surface. Micro-Aid in the diet increased the amount of manure N and decreased N lossis in the winter. The addition of Micro-Aid in the diet resulted in no difference in nutrient mass balance during the summer. There was no difference in N excreted in manure or lost via volatilization in the summer experiment. Supplementing cattle grazing smooth bromegrass pasture with crop residue and byproducts may be a viable option to extend the grazing season or increase carrying capacity. Two experiments (2010 and 2011) were conducted to determine the effect on forage intake of supplementing cattle grazing smooth bromegrass pasture with a byproduct and crop residue blend. Cattle grazed at 1) the recommending <b>strocking</b> rate (7. 56 AUM/ha in 2010 or 9. 46 AUM/ha in 2011) with no supplementation (CON) or 2) double the recommended stocking rate (15. 1 AUM/ha in 2010 and 18. 9 AUM/ha in 2011) with supplementation (SUP). In experiment 1 (2010) nonpregrnant, nonlactating cows grazed smooth bromegrass pasture from mid April to mid Spetmeber. Supplemented cows were fed a 35 % Synergy and 65 % wheat straw mixture daily. The ensiled mixture (46. 6 % DM) was fed from late April to mid-August and a fresh mixture (30. 7 % DM; mixed at feeding time) from mid-August to mid-September. In experiment 2 (2011), cows with spring born calves at side grazed from early May to mid-September. A fresh supplement of 30 % MDGS and 70 % cornstalk blend was fed daily. No differences in performance or diet quality were observed. Consequently, supplement replaced 40 % of grazed forage intake in 2010 and 36. 3 % of forage intake in 2011. Supplementing byproduct and crop residue mixtures can replace forage intake of cattle grazing smooth bromegrass pasture. Advisors: Galen E. Erickson and Terry Klopfenstei...|$|R
2500|$|Injuries to Kosar {{and two of}} his backups sidelined {{them for}} much of the [...] season, but the Browns still {{finished}} 10–6. A final-week comeback victory in a snowstorm at Cleveland Municipal Stadium over the Houston Oilers clinched them a wild-card playoff spot and a home game rematch against the Oilers in the first round. After Mike Pagel, in for an injured Don <b>Strock</b> (the recently signed ex-Dolphins quarterback), threw a touchdown pass to Webster Slaughter late in the fourth quarter to pull the Browns within a point at 24–23, the Browns had three chances to recover an onside kick (due to penalties), but the Oilers recovered and stopped the Cleveland comeback.|$|E

[...] Bama could not answer, but the punt left Notre Dame backed up to their own goal. [...] With time ticking away and Notre Dame facing a third and eight, Alabama {{had a chance to get}} the ball back in excellent field position, but Irish QB Tom Clements threw a 35-yard pass to tight end Robin Webber and Notre Dame held on to win the game and the AP national championship.|$|E
2500|$|On April 5, 2006, {{months after}} {{independent}} investigators had {{demonstrated that the}} levee failures were not due to natural forces beyond intended design strength, Lt. Gen. Carl <b>Strock</b> testified before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Energy and Water that, [...] "We have now concluded we had problems with {{the design of the}} structure." [...] He also testified that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers did not know of this mechanism of failure prior to August 29, 2005. The claim of ignorance is refuted by the National Science Foundation investigators hired by the Army Corps of Engineers, who point to a 1986 study (E-99 study) by the corps itself that such separations were possible in the I-wall design. This issue is addressed again in a study released in August 2015 by J. David Rogers et al. who concluded that a misinterpretation of the 1986 study occurred apparently because the Corps had draped a tarpaulin over the gap that formed between the bases of the deflecting sheet piles and the soil in which they were embedded, so they did not see the gap. The tarpaulin was there for safety and to stop water that would seep through the interlocks. Failure to include the gap in interpretation of the test results introduced unconservatism in the final designs based on these tests. It allowed the use of shorter sheet piles, and reduced overall flood protection reliability.|$|E
