40|$|The {{increase}} of motor vehicles, especially in cities, cause transport problems of traffic congestion, vehicle accidents, {{air pollution and}} a lack of public spaces. The increasing number of motor vehicles consumes huge amounts of finite petrol energy and emits large amounts of gases that are harmful to the atmosphere and the natural environment. Therefore, the current road transport network is not a sustainable form of public transport for the future. In order to seek a suitable transportation mode, the Infrastructure and Engineering Business Unit of the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality (NMBM) did some feasibility studies about light rail transit (LRT) from 1984 to 1988. The NMBM-report (1988 : 8) concluded that a LRT system would provide the most suitable and primary mode to serve Nelson Mandela Bay (NMB). Although LRT was regarded as the most suitable primary mode of transport at that time (1988), further studies that were reported in 2006 recommended an alternative public transportation system. This research refers to these studies done for the NMB area and other studies and reports for other areas, but focus on the identification of the most suitable civil engineering components for a conceptual elevated light rail transit (ELRT) model. Electrical driven LRT systems have advantages over internal-combustion driven vehicles in terms of environmental protection. Traditional LRT systems are at ground level and are integrated with the existing road network. Some successful LRT systems indicate that the success of LRT systems is mainly dependent on integration with the existing road network. However, the integration of road transport systems with LRT systems cause increased congestion and accidents. An ELRT system can solve these problems. Bangkok has already built an ELRT system to solve its severe traffic congestion. 4 In order to develop a conceptual ELRT model, this research aimed to determine the most suitable civil engineering components for a conceptual ELRT model, including: (i) the most suitable type of bridge foundation; (ii) the most suitable type bridge girder; (iii) the most suitable type of sleeper; and (iv) whether the track should be a ballasted or non-ballasted type. The grounded theory approach was adopted to build up sets of data from which the most suitable components could be selected. In addition, design analyses were done of the various types of components to determine their suitability for a conceptual ELRT model. Experienced engineers and experts were also consulted to identify the most suitable components. After analyses and selection of the most suitable components, outstanding experts were approached to evaluate the components that showed up as the most suitable through the research. The research results indicated that bored and cast-in-place piles, a double-cell trapezoidal segmental box girder, and twin-block sleepers on a non-ballasted <b>sleeper</b> <b>bed</b> are the most suitable civil engineering component...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Considerable {{longitudinal}} rail {{forces and}} displacements may develop in {{continuous welded rail}} (CWR) track on long-span bridges due to temperature variations. The track stability may be disturbed due to excessive relative displacements between the <b>sleepers</b> and ballast <b>bed</b> and the accompanied reduction in frictional resistance. For high-speed tracks, however, solving these problems by installing rail expansion devices in the track is not an attractive solution as these devices may cause a local disturbance of the vertical track stiffness and track geometry which will require intensive maintenance. With reference to temperature, two actions are considered by the bridge loading standards, the uniform variation in the rail and deck temperature and the temperature gradient in deck. Generally, the effect of temperature gradient has been disregarded in the interaction analysis. This paper mainly deals with the effect of temperature gradient on the track-bridge interaction {{with respect to the}} support reaction, rail stresses and stability.

The results show: The {{location of the}} biggest hydrodynamic pressure {{is in the middle}} of the crack and near the not void area. The amplitude and frequency of load have obvious influence on the hydrodynamic pressure. When the load amplitude is more than 30 kN or load frequency exceeds 10 HZ, the effect on the hydrodynamic pressure is particularly notable.

Ensuring the high speed rail traffic, increasing railway track capacities, providing comfortable and safe ride as well as high reliability and availability railway track, has led to development of innovative systems for railway track. The so-called slab track was first built in 1972 and since then, they have developed many different slab track systems around the world. Slab track was also built on slovenian railway network. The most recent implementation of slab track is in tunnels Križiški, Jurgovski and Ležeški on a section line Sežana – Gornje Ležeče. In comparison to ballasted track, slab track requires no maintenance, so it is installed mainly on high speed and highly loaded lines. Due {{to the possibility of}} direct mounting rails to the structures, the low construction height and lower weight than conventional track, slab track is built on sections in tunnels and on bridges. Moreover, the advantage of slab track is also longer life cycle, better geometric stability of the track, safer and comfortable ride.

40|$|Railway {{prestressed}} concrete sleeper or so-called 2 ̆ 2 concrete tie 2 ̆ 2 {{is an important}} component of railway track structures. The dynamic interaction between concrete <b>sleepers</b> and ballast <b>bed</b> has rarely been studied because of the main emphasis placed on global track dynamics. Until recently, the health monitoring of track components becomes compulsory in order to develop the optimal maintenance model. Since railway tracks are normally subjected to dynamic loading, it is crucial therefore to evaluate the dynamic properties of their components. Experimental modal analysis is an efficient technique to evaluate the mechanical properties of any structures based on the non-destructive testing measurements. This paper presents results of an experimental modal analysis of {{prestressed concrete}} sleepers in voided in-situ conditions. Two types of prestressed concrete sleepers were provided by the Australian manufacturers. The concrete sleepers were tested using an impact hammer excitation technique over the frequency range of interest: 0 to 1600 Hz. Frequency response functions (FRFs) were measured using the Bruel 2 ̆ 6 Kjaer PULSE dynamic analyser. The FRFs were processed using the STARModal analysis package to identify natural frequencies and the corresponding mode shapes for the sleepers. The conclusions are presented on the effect of voids and pockets on the dynamic properties of prestressed concrete sleepers. The void configuration presented is the single hovering. Vibration parameters of concrete sleepers are required {{for the development of a}} realistic dynamic model of railway track capable of predicting its responses to impact loads due to wheel burns, irregularities of the rail, so on...|$|R

Planning of the new Auckland and Wellington overnight express began in 1963 and 1964, and the concept of the train, as involving, an order for 31 stainless steel carriages - with two trainsets each night, of 5 twinette carriages, 5 single berth <b>sleepers</b> (16 <b>beds</b> per carriage), a licensed buffet car and a power car, never changed. The public announcement of plans for the new train were announced in December 1965 [...] Extensive study was made of other early 1960's Australian overnight train sets, particularly the Sundlander and Overland and similar designs in the USA, the final Santa Fe High level and Burlington cars. New Zealand built cars were estimated to cost by NZR CME, J.Black in 1958, 25,000 pounds for a second class carriage and 35,000 pounds for a first class car. By 1960 NZR had concluded that stainless steel carriages, which lowered maintenance needs and avoided the need to paint were preferable, even with at a cost premium of 12-20%. That effectively meant, in 1970 a carriage cost of $100,000+ for Japanese or Australian stainless steel construction, cf with $60,000 to 70,000 for conventional Italian or Swedish built first class cars.( [...] In 1941 NZR built 31 seat 1st class cars cost 7140 pounds, 2nd class 56 seat carriages, 5920 pounds [...] ) In 1967 the new train was vigorously promoted by Minister of Railways, J.B. Gordon, on the grounds it would deliver a clear return, on its purchase cost and operation. Ironically most equivalent overseas services ceased that year and following US Mail ending its use of almost all US rail passenger services for 1st class mail, in Sept 1967, Santa Fe applied to ICC to withdraw 33 out of 39 of its long distance expresses. That is, all but the LA-Chicago Super Chief and its Frisco connection, the Texas Chief (Chicago-Houston), its Dallas connection and 2 LA San Diego locals. Nevertheless approval for NZR to release [...] tenders for the new train were belatedly made on 19 November 1968. The Silver Star service broke new ground in New Zealand by providing a full on-board crew of car stewards (sourced from the inter-island rail ferry service) who doubled as dining car staff at meal times. A great deal of study had been made of on train meal provision, particularly of German and British Rail. The high wage and other industrial demands of the ferry stewards used, were {{one of the reasons the}} service failed. [...] However, the product was effectively ten years too late. Travel by National Airways Corporation 737 took just over one hour; the Silver Star, by contrast, took around 12 hours and 30 minutes. Due to the freeze on rail fare and charges imposed by the Kirk Labour Government, which effectively meant the overnight price from Wellington to Auckland was held at $18 from late 1971 to early 1976, use of the train was high in 1974-5 and 1975-6. In the late 1970s the usual overnight patronage was only about 65 on most runs and only half the carriage stock was used for most of the year except during a few airline strikes.|$|R
