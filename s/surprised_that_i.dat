500|$|During his presidency, Houphouët-Boigny benefited {{greatly from}} {{the wealth of}} Côte d'Ivoire; {{by the time of}} his death in 1993, his {{personal}} wealth was estimated to be between US$7 and $11billion. With regards to his large fortune, Houphouët-Boigny said in 1983, [...] "People are <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> like gold. It's just that I was born in it." [...] The Ivorian leader acquired a dozen properties in the metropolitan area of Paris (including Hotel Masseran on Masseran Street in the 7th arrondissement of Paris), a property in Castel Gandolfo in Italy, and a house in Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland. He owned real estate companies, such as Grand Air SI, SI Picallpoc and Interfalco, and had many shares in prestigious jewelry and watchmaking companies, such as Piaget SA and Harry Winston. He placed his fortune in Switzerland, once asking if [...] "there is any serious man on Earth not stocking parts of his fortune in Switzerland".|$|E
2500|$|In Paris at her World Championships debut, Dibaba won the 5000 metres in {{a sprint}} finish against Marta Dominguez of Spain and Edith Masai of Kenya. This {{made her the}} {{youngest}} athlete to win an individual {{gold medal at the}} World Championships. Recalling the race, Dibaba said, [...] "I competed in Paris only because I had the 'A' standard. No one expected me to win. There was no pressure from anywhere. All of them [...] were looking at each other [...] and no one was focusing on the finish line. I just went for it and was <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had won." ...|$|E
2500|$|The antagonists Grendel and Grendel's {{mother are}} portrayed by Crispin Glover and Angelina Jolie, respectively. Glover had {{previously}} worked with Zemeckis in Back to the Future, when he portrayed George McFly. Zemeckis had found Glover tiresome on set, {{because of his}} {{lack of understanding of}} shooting a film, but realized this would not be a problem as on a motion capture film he could choose his angles later. Glover's dialogue was entirely in Old English. Jolie had wanted to work with Zemeckis, and had read the poem years before but could not remember it well until she read the script and was able to recall basic themes. The actress recounted her first impression of her character's appearance by saying [...] "...I was told I {{was going to be a}} lizard. Then I was brought into a room with Bob, and a bunch of pictures and examples, and he showed me this picture of a woman half painted gold, and then a lizard. And, I’ve got kids and I thought 'That's great. That's so bizarre. I'm going to be this crazy reptilian person and creature.'" [...] Jolie filmed her role over two days when she was three months pregnant. She was startled by the character's nude human form, stating that for an animated film [...] "I was really <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> felt that exposed." ...|$|E

2500|$|Through {{her role}} in Too Young To Go Steady and because she was “precociously attractive” (as one critic put it) in a very similar way to Elizabeth Taylor at the same age, Bazlen came to be dubbed “the next Elizabeth Taylor” and was signed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (who started {{promoting}} her as “the new American Bardot”). The first film she did for MGM was King of Kings, which also starred Jeffrey Hunter as Jesus. Bazlen {{played the role of}} Salome. Bazlen won the part when she met the film's producer, Samuel Bronston, at a party to which Bazlen's mother had taken her. Bazlen said of the offer, that [...] "It was like [...] all over again, for Mr Bronston offered me the Salome part [...] straight away." [...] Nevertheless, Bazlen’s performance as Salome came in for especially hostile criticism at the time, the ferocity of it being partly inspired by the fact that Bazlen’s selection for the role was viewed as MGM dictated. Nevertheless, just as the film itself is now highly regarded Bazlen’s performance has likewise been re-evaluated down the years as being superb (her voluptuous seduction of a drunken lascivious Herod winning her especially rave reviews.) Indeed, in her review for Rotten Tomatoes, Kimberly Heinrichs, states that: [...] "This 1961 version of....gives historical context to the best-known Biblical tale and features many memorable moments, such as a moving Sermon on the Mount and a vixenish Salome [...] dancing for her stepfather in a performance that rivals today's MTV video offerings". Hunter's performance as Jesus, especially in the Sermon on the Mount scene, has also won much acclaim, as have the performances of Robert Ryan as John the Baptist and Frank Thring as Herod Antipas – the film [...] is also included in Danny Peary's list of [...] "must see" [...] films in his book 'Guide for the Film Fanatic'). In its review of the film, Film Fanatic states: [...] "My favorite “Roman scene” shows the infamous Salome (played by Brigid Bazlen as a sexy teenage hussy) tempting her stepfather, King Herod (Thring), into decapitating John the Baptist (a shaggy-headed Robert Ryan) and bringing her his head on a platter; while this vignette may not be substantiated by biblical scholars, it plays well on the screen!". Accordingly, Bazlen's performance as Salome is widely regarded as her best ever performance. Bazlen herself said of her role as Salome, [...] "A fantastic amount of research went into King of Kings and it seems that Salome was in her teens when she demanded the head of John the Baptist. [...] She may well be the first juvenile delinquent on record. Some people are <b>surprised</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> used no veils in my dance, but it is a false assumption that Salome did a strip tease. [...] I had to form my seductive charming of Herod with a pure Oriental-African dance movement of the period." [...] According to Bazlen's daughter Marguerite, despite the unfair criticism Bazlen received {{at the time of the}} film's release, Bazlen was always very proud of her performance. Furthermore, shortly after making the film, Bazlen herself said that [...] "I was a little overwhelmed to have such an important role for my first film part, but I found Nicholas Ray to be a most considerate director." ...|$|E
