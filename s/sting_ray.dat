5|$|Announcing {{plans for}} the future of the British {{military}} on 21 July 2004, the Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon detailed plans to reduce the upgrade programme to cover only 16 MRA4 aircraft, and suggested that an eventual fleet of 12 might suffice. PA02, the second development MRA4, achieved its first flight in December 2004 and was used to test elements of the mission system and the air vehicle. BAE Systems received a contract worth £1.1 billion for 12 MRA4s on 18 July 2006; three were to be development aircraft and nine more converted to production standard. The Nimrod MRA4 successfully released the <b>Sting</b> <b>Ray</b> torpedo for the first time on 30 July 2007.|$|E
5|$|Two hardpoints {{are present}} on the {{underside}} of the airframe on which the HM1 model can carry four <b>Sting</b> <b>Ray</b> torpedoes or Mk 11 Mod 3 depth charges. Some customers have chosen to deploy the Marte anti-ship missile on the AW101; as of 2011, the Royal Navy is considering equipping their Merlin fleet with an anti-surface missile. The Mk1, Mk3 and Mk3A variants can mount general purpose machine guns in up to five locations in the main cabin, aimed out of both door and window apertures. AgustaWestland has examined the integration of rockets and additional ground-attack weapons.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Sting</b> <b>Ray</b> was lauded in the {{automotive}} press almost unanimously for its handling, road adhesion, and sheer power.|$|E

25|$|Car Life {{magazine}} bestowed {{its annual}} Award for Engineering Excellence on the 1963 <b>Sting</b> <b>Ray.</b> Chevy's small-block V-8 – {{the most consistent}} component of past Corvette performance – was rated by the buff books to be even better in the <b>Sting</b> <b>Ray.</b> The 1963 was noted to have an edge over past models in both traction and handling because the new independent rear suspension reduced wheel spin compared to the live-axle cars.|$|E
25|$|The 1963 <b>Sting</b> <b>Ray</b> {{production}} car's lineage can {{be traced}} to two separate GM projects: the Q-Corvette, and perhaps more directly, Mitchell's racing <b>Sting</b> <b>Ray.</b> The Q-Corvette, initiated in 1957, envisioned a smaller, more advanced Corvette as a coupe-only model, boasting a rear transaxle, independent rear suspension, and four-wheel disc brakes, with the rear brakes mounted inboard. Exterior styling was purposeful, with peaked fenders, a long nose, and a short, bobbed tail.|$|E

25|$|The Chevrolet Corvette (C2) (also {{known as}} the Chevrolet Corvette <b>Sting</b> <b>Ray)</b> is the second {{generation}} of the Chevrolet Corvette sports car, produced by the Chevrolet division of General Motors for the 1963 to 1967 model years.|$|E
25|$|The 1963 Corvette <b>Sting</b> <b>Ray</b> {{not only}} had a new design, but also newfound {{handling}} prowess. The <b>Sting</b> <b>Ray</b> was also a somewhat lighter Corvette, so acceleration improved despite unchanged horsepower. For the 1963 model year, 21,513 units would be built, which was up 50 percent from the record-setting 1962 version. Production was divided almost evenly between the convertible and the new coupe – 10,919 and 10,594, respectively – {{and more than half}} the convertibles were ordered with the optional lift-off hardtop. Nevertheless, the coupe wouldn't sell as well again throughout the <b>Sting</b> <b>Ray</b> years. In fact, not until 1969 (by which time the coupe came with removable T-tops) did the closed Corvette sell better than the open one. Equipment installations for 1963 began reflecting the market's demand for more civility in sporting cars. The power brake option went into 15 percent of production, power steering into 12 percent. On the other hand, only 278 buyers specified the $421.80 air conditioning; leather upholstery – a mere $80.70 – was ordered on only 1,114 cars. The cast aluminum knock-off wheels, manufactured for Chevy by Kelsey-Hayes, cost $322.80 a set, but few buyers checked off that option. However, almost 18,000 Sting Rays left St. Louis with the four-speed manual gearbox – better than four out of every five.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Zora Arkus-Duntov {{and other}} GM {{engineers}} had become fascinated with mid and rear-engine designs. It {{was during the}} Corvair's development that Duntov took the mid/rear-engine layout to its limits in the CERV I concept. The Chevrolet Experimental Research Vehicle was a lightweight, open-wheel single-seat racer. A rear-engined Corvette was briefly considered during 1958–60, progressing {{as far as a}} full-scale mock-up designed around the Corvair's entire rear-mounted power package, including its complicated air-cooled flat-six {{as an alternative to the}} Corvette's usual water-cooled V-8. By the fall of 1959, elements of the Q-Corvette and the <b>Sting</b> <b>Ray</b> Special racer would be incorporated into experimental project XP-720, which was the design program that led directly to the production 1963 Corvette <b>Sting</b> <b>Ray.</b> The XP-720 sought to deliver improved passenger accommodation, more luggage space, and superior ride and handling over previous Corvettes.|$|E
25|$|The 1967 Corvette <b>Sting</b> <b>Ray</b> was {{the last}} Corvette of the second generation, and five years of {{refinements}} made it {{the best of the}} line. Although {{it was meant to be}} a redesign year, its intended successor the C3 was found to have some undesirable aerodynamic traits. Duntov demanded more time in the wind tunnel to devise fixes before it went into production.|$|E
25|$|The Hawk 200 {{can launch}} many NATO {{standard}} guided missiles including AIM-9L Sidewinder AAM, ASRAAM AAM, AIM-120 AMRAAM AAM, AGM-65 Maverick AGM, Sea Eagle AShM and <b>Sting</b> <b>Ray</b> homing torpedoes. The Hawk 200 can also carry {{a variety of}} bombs, including 113kg bombs, 240kg bombs, 540kg bombs and Paveway II guided bombs. The AIM-9L Sidewinder missiles are launched from the wingtip air-to-air missile stations on each wing.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the waters}} of the bay he {{described}} [...] "scallop shells which were used as an oil lamp with a bulrush wick, banks of cockles covered with birds, grey and white gulls, a 13-16 lb size schnapper ground off Mt Martha Point, mutton fish or venus ear- bait, coatfish, parrot fish, leather jackets, flathead, dog fish, <b>sting</b> <b>rays,</b> shark tailed rays, and pig fish (Castracion) [...] "that he thought to be [...] "very old." ...|$|R
25|$|In 1961 the XP-755 Mako Shark show car was {{designed}} by Larry Shinoda as a concept for future Corvettes. In keeping with the name, the streamlining, pointed snout, and other detailing was partly inspired {{by the look of}} that very fast fish. The 1961 Corvette tail was given two additional tail lights (six total) for the concept car. The body inspired the 1963 production <b>Sting</b> <b>Ray.</b>|$|E
25|$|Key Hole patrols were {{designed}} purely around reconnaissance and surveillance; usually lightly equipped and armed with defensive weapons—evasive techniques {{were employed to}} break contact from the enemy should the need arise, avoiding contact with the enemy was paramount. <b>Sting</b> <b>Ray</b> operations were {{the exact opposite of}} Key Hole missions with goals more closely in line of offensive strikes, the FORECON operators were heavily armed and used artillery and/or naval gunfire support, if available.|$|E
25|$|The vehicle's inner {{structure}} {{received as}} much attention as the aerodynamics of its exterior. Fiberglass outer panels were retained, but the <b>Sting</b> <b>Ray</b> emerged with nearly twice as much steel support in its central structure as the 1958—62 Corvette. The resulting extra weight was balanced by a reduction in fiberglass thickness, so the finished product actually weighed a bit less than the old roadster. Passenger room was as good as before despite the tighter wheelbase, and the reinforcing steel girder made the cockpit both stronger and safer.|$|E
5000|$|The major predators of {{this species}} are {{typically}} sharks, and may include humans, killer whales (Orcinus orca) and <b>sting</b> <b>rays.</b> In the early 1980s, many were deliberately killed in a Taiwanese driftnet fishery in the Arafura Sea, off northwestern Australia. [...] Large-mesh nets set to protect bathers from sharks in South Africa and Australia have also resulted in {{a substantial number of}} deaths. Gillnets are also having an impact, and are a problem throughout most of the species' range.|$|R

5|$|The Virginia Aquarium & Marine Science Center (formerly the Virginia Marine Science Museum) is {{a popular}} {{aquarium}} near the oceanfront that features the 300,000-gallon Norfolk Canyon Aquarium, containing sand tiger, nurse and brown sharks, as well as <b>sting</b> <b>rays</b> and other large open-ocean dwellers. There is also a 70,000-gallon sea turtle aquarium, sea turtle hatchling laboratory, hands-on ocean exploration exhibits, jellyfish and octopus aquariums, and even a life-size model of a humpback whale. Other features include the Owls Creek salt marsh and a nature trail.|$|R
25|$|In the 1990s, the US Coast Guard, {{seeking to}} tackle drug {{trafficking}} on small speed boats via armed aerial interdiction helicopters, evaluated several options and selected the AW109 as the winner. For {{a number of}} years, eight armed AW109s, designated MH-68A <b>Sting</b> <b>Ray,</b> were leased from AgustaWestland and deployed at Coast Guard land facilities and onboard cutters. Positive experience with the AW109 led to the Coast Guard deciding to arm all of its helicopters and, following adaptions of their existing assets, the AW109s were returned after the lease expired.|$|E
25|$|The C2 was {{designed}} by Larry Shinoda {{under the direction of}} GM chief stylist Bill Mitchell. Inspiration was drawn from several sources: the contemporary Jaguar E-Type, one of which Mitchell owned and enjoyed driving frequently; the radical <b>Sting</b> <b>Ray</b> Racer Mitchell designed in 1959 as Chevrolet no longer participated in factory racing; and a Mako shark Mitchell caught while deep-sea fishing. Zora Arkus-Duntov ("father of the Corvette") disliked the split rear window (which also raised safety concerns due to reduced visibility) and it was discontinued in 1964, as were the fake hood vents.|$|E
25|$|The Nimrod {{featured}} a sizeable bomb bay in which, {{in addition to}} armaments such as torpedoes and missiles, could be housed {{a wide variety of}} specialist equipment for many purposes, such as up to 150 sonobuoys for ASW purposes or multiple air-deployed dinghies and droppable survival packs such as Lindholme Gear for SAR missions; additional fuel tanks and cargo could also be carried in the bomb bay during ferrying flights. Other armaments equippable in the bomb bay include mines, bombs, and nuclear depth charges; later munitions included the <b>Sting</b> <b>Ray</b> torpedo and Harpoon missile for increased capabilities.|$|E
25|$|The pilings sit {{in about}} 5–10 {{feet of water}} and extend about 5–10 feet above the water, {{depending}} on the tide. The pilings and the island's outline shape are clearly visible from the Julia Tuttle Causeway {{as well as from}} many of the tall buildings that overlook the bay. They present a clear hazard to boat navigation and the interior of the island is a peaceful place that remains free of boat and jet ski traffic for kayakers, dolphin, manatee, <b>sting</b> <b>rays,</b> manta rays, and many types of fish.|$|R
50|$|Ocean Explorer {{features}} saltwater {{species from}} all over the world including sea jellies, eels, seahorses and seven species of sharks. Shark species include brown-banded bamboo sharks, nurse sharks, sandbar sharks, blacktip reef sharks, whitetip reef sharks, grey reef sharks, and zebra sharks. One of the most popular features is the 40-foot shark tunnel. Guests can view the sharks, sea turtles and <b>sting</b> <b>rays</b> swimming just inches away! The shark tunnel weighs 26,000 pounds and was lifted through the roof of the aquarium with a crane. The tunnel is made from 3.5 inch thick acrylic.|$|R
