5|$|The host {{includes}} 15kΩ pull-down resistors on each data line. When no {{device is}} connected, this pulls both data lines low into the so-called <b>single-ended</b> zero state (SE0 in the USB documentation), and indicates a reset or disconnected connection.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the {{university}} also operates the McMaster Nuclear Reactor, used for nuclear {{science and engineering}} research since 1959. The University regularly acquires an operating license for the reactor from the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, with the latest 10-year license issued on 1 July 2014. The strength of nuclear science at McMaster was augmented in 1968 under the presidency of Dr. H.G. Thode by {{the construction of a}} 10MV Model FN Tandem particle accelerator. The 3MV Model KN <b>single-ended</b> accelerator was added the same year. The academic direction of the laboratory fell to the Physics Department in the early days, as it was primarily a nuclear structure laboratory. During the next 28 years, the nuclear research effort was extensive, with hundreds of graduate students trained and many publications generated. The SLOWPOKE reactor is used for research, educational, and commercial applications such as neutron radiography, and medical radioisotope production; Iodine-125 is used in cancer therapy. The reactor at McMaster produces 25 percent of the world's supply of iodine-125, an isotope used in nuclear medicine to treat prostate cancer. The production of molybdenum-99 at Chalk River Laboratories has occasionally been moved to the University's reactor, when Chalk River's National Research Universal reactor is forced to shut down.|$|E
25|$|MUNI {{has another}} 30 unrestored PCC cars in {{long-term}} storage. The unrestored cars include five additional San Francisco double-ended cars, 10 San Francisco <b>single-ended</b> cars, 12 <b>single-ended</b> cars acquired from St. Louis in 1957, two <b>single-ended</b> cars from Philadelphia, and two <b>single-ended</b> cars from Pittsburgh. A further previously restored car from Philadelphia was written off after a traffic accident in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Specimen's line of tube {{amplifiers}} use 1940s-era tube circuitry, yet {{is compatible}} with an iPod or computer. The product line includes a <b>single-ended</b> stereo amp, 300B stereo tube amp, <b>single-ended</b> monoblock, a <b>single-ended</b> 2A3 tube amp, a pentode-driven 2A3 amp, and the Octoblock (an eight channel single ended power amp created for the collaborative project with Andrew Bird called the Sonic Arboretum).|$|E
25|$|A {{fleet of}} PCC streetcars from San Francisco, Philadelphia, and Newark, built between 1946 and 1948, {{operate on the}} line. , MUNI was {{operating}} 27 of these cars, restored to various states of service. Among the restored cars in service, three are original San Francisco double-ended PCC cars. Another 16 cars are <b>single-ended</b> cars acquired from SEPTA in Philadelphia in 1992 (which continues to operate another 18 cars today, retrofitted for ADA compliance), while the remaining 11 cars are <b>single-ended</b> cars acquired from New Jersey Transit in Newark in 2002.|$|E
25|$|<b>Single-ended</b> types, such as stack, {{generally}} only admit {{a single}} peek, {{at the end}} that is modified. Double-ended types, such as deques, admit two peeks, one at each end.|$|E
25|$|Radial or <b>single-ended</b> {{electrolytic}} capacitor styles have a bar across {{the side of}} the capacitor to indicate the negative terminal side, and the negative terminal lead is shorter than the positive terminal lead.|$|E
25|$|This {{solution}} required some rebuilding {{to convert}} the Hyde Street trackage and terminus to operation by the <b>single-ended</b> cars of the Powell line, and also to allow the whole system to be operated from a single car barn and power house. Much of the infrastructure remained unchanged {{from the time of}} the earthquake.|$|E
25|$|An {{operational}} amplifier (often op-amp or opamp) is a DC-coupled high-gain electronic voltage amplifier with a differential input and, usually, a <b>single-ended</b> output. In this configuration, an op-amp produces an output potential (relative to circuit ground) that is typically {{hundreds of thousands}} of times larger than the potential difference between its input terminals.|$|E
25|$|The {{car barn}} is located between Washington and Jackson Streets just uphill of where Mason Street crosses them. Cars reverse {{into the barn}} off Jackson Street and run out into Washington Street, {{coasting}} downhill for both moves. To ensure that <b>single-ended</b> cars leave facing in the correct direction, the car barn contains a fourth turntable. Cars are moved around the car barn {{with the assistance of}} a rubber-tired tractor.|$|E
25|$|The {{powerplant}} {{consisted of}} one large high-pressure central turbine for providing the motive {{power to a}} central propeller, {{and a pair of}} low-pressure turbines driving two outboard screws which were used for manoeuvre, and which were shut down when the vessel was under way. Steam was provided by six <b>single-ended,</b> forced draft Scotch boilers delivering a pressure of 150 pounds. W. & A. Fletcher subcontracted the hull to the Delaware River Iron Shipbuilding and Engine Works of Chester, Pennsylvania.|$|E
25|$|Starting in January 1954, 30 PCC streetcars {{bought from}} Twin City Rapid Transit {{provided}} all {{service on the}} route. They were <b>single-ended,</b> requiring {{construction of a new}} turning loop at the Franklin Avenue terminal. The cars had been built 1946–1949 by the St. Louis Car Company and were sold by TCRT when that system went through a conversion to buses. Four cars were scrapped over the years, and two were sold to Shaker Heights Rapid Transit in 1978.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} large churches, {{such as the}} Cathedral of San Giovanni in Laterano in Rome, {{consisted of}} a <b>single-ended</b> basilica with one apsidal end and a courtyard, or atrium, at the other end. As Christian liturgy developed, processions {{became part of the}} proceedings. The processional door was that which led from the furthest end of the building, while the door most used by the public might be that central {{to one side of the}} building, as in a basilica of law. This is the case in many cathedrals and churches.|$|E
25|$|Horn {{loudspeakers}} {{can provide}} very high efficiencies, making {{them a good}} match for very low-powered amplifiers, such as <b>single-ended</b> triode amps or other tube amplifiers. After WWII, some early hi-fi fans {{went so far as}} to build low frequency horns whose mouths took up much of a wall of the listening room. The throats were sometimes outside on the lawn, or in the basement. With the coming of stereo in the 1960s, this approach was rarely seen. Many loudspeaker buyers and do-it-yourself loudspeaker fans sought smaller designs for aesthetic reasons.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad {{ordered a}} custom-built, six-car train set {{based on the}} RDC design named the Roger Williams. It {{consisted}} of two <b>single-ended</b> cab units and four intermediate cars to make a complete train. The units were fitted with third-rail shoes, electric traction motors, and associated gear for operation into Grand Central Terminal, though this was short-lived. In the New Haven's later years, the set was broken up, and used with regular New Haven RDCs, and by Amtrak into the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} company, the Staten Island and New York Ferry Company, ran {{services from}} Whitehall Street to Tompkinsville, Stapleton, and Clifton. It originally ran <b>single-ended</b> boats but eventually expanded its fleet to include double-ended boats. To accommodate growing ridership, three double-ended boats (Southfield I, Westfield I, and Clifton I) were purchased for the Richmond Turnpike Ferry in the 1850s, and another three (Westfield II, Southfield II, and Middletown) were {{obtained in the}} 1860s. Clifton I and Westfield I were purchased by the Union Army in 1861, who used the ships as blockades against the Confederate Army during the Civil War.|$|E
25|$|The {{volumetric}} {{activation energy}} {{indicates that the}} rate of Harper–Dorn creep is controlled by vacancy diffusion to and from dislocations, resulting in climb-controlled dislocation motion. Unlike in other creep mechanisms, the dislocation density here is constant and independent of the applied stress. Moreover, the dislocation density must be low for Harper–Dorn creep to dominate. The density has been proposed to increase as dislocations move via cross-slip from one slip-plane to another, thereby increasing the dislocation length per unit volume. Cross-slip can also result in jogs {{along the length of the}} dislocation, which, if large enough, can act as <b>single-ended</b> dislocation sources.|$|E
25|$|The line used Metropolitan line A60 and A62 sub-surface {{rolling stock}} built by Cravens of Sheffield in two batches between 1960 and 1962. It was {{upgraded}} in 1994 with improved suspension, lighting, heating and ventilation. The rolling stock was regularly interchanged with that {{used on the}} main Metropolitan line and usually carried both East London and Metropolitan line maps, but ELL trains were four-car units with a driving cab at each end, unlike Metropolitan line trains, which, aside from the Chesham shuttle, ran as eight-car trains. Metropolitan line trains were mostly two <b>single-ended</b> units coupled together with fully operational driving cabs at each end: the Met could use any ELL trains, but the ELL could use only double-ended units.|$|E
25|$|Widlar {{disposed}} with hybrid technology, {{and used}} only diffused resistors formed within the silicon die. Each {{of the nine}} NPN transistors was sized and shaped according to its function, contrary to an earlier practice of employing standard minimal-area patterns. Widlar introduced three innovations: interfacing a long-tail with a <b>single-ended</b> stage without losing half of the gain, shifting the DC level using only NPN transistors, and optional frequency compensation with an external capacitor. Compensation increased bandwidth of the device to 25-30MHz, an unprecedented breakthrough for monolithic amplifiers at that time. Widlar did not consider the μA702 prototype good enough for production, but Fairchild decided otherwise and rushed the chip into production in October 1964. The device set the direction for the industry for decades, despite poor common-mode rejection ratio, weak output drive capabilities, and a price of $300. According to Jack Gifford, the top management of Fairchild noticed the novelty and learned of Widlar's existence only after receiving enthusiastic feedback from the market.|$|E
