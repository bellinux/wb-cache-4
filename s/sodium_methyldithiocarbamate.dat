50|$|Methylamine {{is a good}} {{nucleophile}} as it {{is highly}} basic and unhindered, but as an amine it is considered a weak base. Its use in organic chemistry is pervasive. Some reactions involving simple reagents include: with phosgene to methyl isocyanate, with carbon disulfide and sodium hydroxide to the <b>sodium</b> <b>methyldithiocarbamate,</b> with chloroform and base to methyl isocyanide and with ethylene oxide to methylethanolamines. Liquid methylamine has solvent properties analogous to those of liquid ammonia.|$|E
40|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>methyldithiocarbamate</b> (SMD; trade name, Metam Sodium) is an abundantly used soil {{fumigant}} {{that can cause}} adverse health effects in humans, including some immunological manifestations. The mechanisms by which SMD acts, and its targets within the immune system are not fully understood. Initial experiments demonstrated that SMD administered by oral gavage substantially decreased IL- 12 production and increased IL- 10 production induced by lipopolysaccharide in mice. The present {{study was conducted to}} further characterize these effects and to evaluate our working hypothesis that the mechanism for these effects involves alteration in signaling through toll-like receptor 4 and that this would suppress innate immunity to infection. SMD decreased the activation of MAP kinases and AP- 1 but not NF-kB in peritoneal macrophages. The expression of mRNA for IL- 1 a, IL- 1 b, IL- 18, IFN-g, IL- 12 p 35, IL- 12 p 40, and macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) was inhibited by SMD, wherea...|$|E
40|$|<b>Sodium</b> <b>methyldithiocarbamate</b> (SMD) is {{the third}} most abundantly used {{conventional}} pesticide in the United States, {{and hundreds of thousands}} of persons are exposed to this compound or its major breakdown product, methylisothiocyanate, at levels greater than recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency. A previous study suggests three mechanisms of action involved to some degree in the inhibition of inflammation and decreased resistance to infection caused by exposure of mice to the compound. One of these mechanisms is oxidative stress. The purpose of the present study was to confirm that this mechanism is involved in the effects of SMD on cytokine production by peritoneal macrophages and to further characterize its role in altered cytokine production. Results indicated that SMD significantly decreased the intracellular concentration of reduced glutathione (GSH), suggesting oxidative stress. This was further indicated by the upregulation of genes involved in the “response to oxidative stress” as determined by microarray analysis. These effects were associated with the inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -induced production of several proinflammatory cytokines. Experimental depletion of GSH with buthionine sulfoximine (BSO) partially prevented the decrease in LPS-induced interleukin (IL) - 6 production caused by SMD and completely prevented the decrease in IL- 12. In contrast, BSO plus SMD substantially enhanced the production of IL- 10. These results along with results from a previous study are consistent with the hypothesis that SMD causes oxidative stress, which contributes to modulation of cytokine production. However, oxidative stress alone cannot explain the increased IL- 10 production caused by SMD...|$|E
