2500|$|Another {{approach}} {{that can be}} used with some languages involves having different data structures, but all have the initial fields, including the next (and prev if double linked list) references in the same location. [...] After defining separate structures for each type of data, a generic structure can be defined that contains the minimum amount of data shared by all the other structures and contained at the top (beginning) of the structures. [...] Then generic routines can be created that use the minimal structure to perform linked list type operations, but separate routines can then handle the specific data. [...] This approach is often used in message parsing routines, where several types of messages are received, but all start with the same <b>set</b> <b>of</b> <b>fields,</b> usually including a field for message type. [...] The generic routines are used to add new messages to a queue when they are received, and remove them from the queue in order to process the message. [...] The message type field is then used to call the correct routine to process the specific type of message.|$|E
