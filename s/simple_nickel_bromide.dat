40|$|Understanding how {{impurities}} and defects modify {{surface chemistry}} {{and structure of}} transition metal oxides is important from a fundamental science perspective and for oxides continued use in industry. Transition metal oxide surfaces Co 3 O 4 (110) and NiO(100) were studied with complementary surface sensitive techniques, including low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), and temperature programmed desorption (TPD), {{to determine the effects}} of impurities and defects on their chemical, physical, and electronic properties. ^ Co 3 O 4 (110) spinel AES and XPS spectra are consistent with previous stoichiometric powder and thin film Co 3 O 4 spinel surfaces and with other cobalt containing spinels. The first published LEED patterns are reported here in, and reveal Type A bulk termination in which octahedral and tetrahedral cation sites are occupied by 3 + and 2 + cobalt cations, respectively. Extended annealing allows the elemental impurities Ca 2 +, K+, Na+, and Cu 1 + to segregate to the surface, and the copper impurity in particular reduces the spinel surface to a rocksalt CoO-like surface. The copper impurity induces a Cu 2 O(110) phase-separation overlayer on the cobalt oxide spinel surface. The Co 3 O 4 (110) substrate cannot be fully re-oxidized to the spinel stoichiometry until all detectable copper is removed from the surface. ^ Low-coordinate transition metal oxide defects were modeled using two different vicinally-cut NiO(100) that resulted in periodic monoatomic stepped substrates with six-atom and seven-atom terrace widths. The AES and XPS spectra are consistent with previous stoichiometric single crystals, powders, and thin film surfaces. LEED shows a characteristic (1 x 1) diffraction pattern for the non-stepped surface and a characteristic spot-splitting diffraction feature for the stepped surfaces correlating to the appropriate step terrace width. ^ TPD probed the surface reactivity of the NiO-bromobenzene (C 6 H 5 Br) adsorbate. A molecularly adsorbed monolayer species desorbs at 169 K for the nonstepped surface and 180 K for the stepped surfaces. The multilayer adsorbate state desorbs from 174 K to 188 K depending upon coverage. A final surface species, observed only on the stepped surfaces, desorbs at 145 K by two pathways. At low coverages dehalogenation occurs resulting in adsorbed bromine, and when these adsorbate sites are saturated, molecular desorption of bromobenzene is then observed. ^ Bromine that remains on the non-stepped and stepped NiO(100) surfaces from dehalogenation appears as <b>nickel</b> <b>bromide</b> determined by the Br 3 p XPS peak with the concentration of bromine higher on the stepped surfaces than on the non-stepped surface. On the non-stepped surface bromobenzene is adsorbed “flat” with the benzene ring parallel to the surface to ensure maximum contact between the molecule and the NiO substrate. The step terraces, however, are too short to easily accommodate this geometry easily and the molecule tilts to fit the step geometry, allowing more bromobenzene to adsorb. Some interaction with the step edge is also most likely important in determining the new adsorbate geometry. ...|$|R

The catalytic properties of a new rhodium C 60 compound are also investigated, with relevance to the evaluation of C 60 as a hydrogen storage medium. Chapter 1 reviews the preparation and chemistry of N-heterocyclic carbenes, emphasising their organometallic reactivity and role as ancillary ligands in homogeneous transition metal catalysis. An overview of relevant nickel and palladium catalysis is also presented, including olefin polymerisation, olefm / CO copolymerisation and Heck coupling reactions. Chapter 2 describes the synthesis and characterisation of the dicarbene ligands tBu CC meth and tBu CC eth and their reactions with various nickel precursors in attempts to prepare chelating dicarbene nickel cis -dihalide complexes. The synthesis, characterisation and chemical reactivity of the cations [Ni(tBu CC meth) 2] 2 +, [(tBu CC meth) NiCl(PMe 3) ] + and [(tBu CC eth) NiCl(PMe 3) ] + is detailed, and their X-ray structures are compared. The unsuccessful preparation of [Ni(tBu CC eth) 2] 2 + and the relative stability of the monocations with respect to dicarbene substitution is discussed and attributed to steric factors. Chapter 3 describes the synthesis, characterisation, reactivity and catalytic studies of <b>simple</b> <b>nickel</b> and palladium cis -dimethyl complexes of the chelating dicarbene ligands. Variable temperature 1 H NMR spectroscopy showed contrasting rates of thermal hydrocarbon elimination from Ni(tBu CC meth) Me 2 and Ni(tBu CC eth) Me 2, which has previously been observed for chelating bis -phosphine analogues with various P,P' linkages (CH 2) n. These observations further corroborate the analogy between dicarbene and 6 /s-phosphine ligands. It was demonstrated that the compounds Pd(tBu CC meth) Me 2 and Pd(tBu CC eth) Me 2 are effective pre-catalysts for the Heck coupling of 4 -bromoanisole and n-butyl acrylate. In addition cations of the type [(tBu CC meth/eth) PdMe(L) ] + (L = pyridine, THF) which are relevant to olefin / CO copolymerisation were prepared. The X-ray structures of M(tBu CC eth) Me 2 (M = Ni, Pd) are discussed as well as the synthesis and structural characterisation of [(|Li-tBu CC meth) {Ni(PMe 3) Me 2 } 2].

The multilayer vibrator enjoys high capacitance, large effective area and low thickness, leading to a high magnetic field sensitivity of 1 mOe at the magnetoelectric field coefficient of 2. 58 V/cmOe in the <b>simple</b> composite with <b>nickel</b> thickness of 0. 2 mm. The model fits the resonance frequency well with the experimental results. Numerical calculation well predicates the magnetoelectric experimental behaviors, presenting a magnetoelectric maximum at about the thickness ratio 0. 3 between the nickel plate and multilayer vibrators. This approach provides a method for the magnetoelectric application...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Electroplated nickel {{coatings}} provide ductility, excellent {{corrosion resistance}} and good wear resistance, which qualifies {{them to meet}} complex demands of engineering, microtechnology and microelectronics. The co-deposition of particles is a promising alternative to deposit layers with adequate microstructure and properties avoiding the rise of residual stress. The incorporation of the sufficient quantity of particles, monodisperse distribution and downsizing to nanometre scale affect the amount of strengthening by dispersion hardening. To avoid agglomeration in the electroplating bath {{as well as in}} the layer is a challenge which has been met by <b>simple</b> Watts <b>nickel</b> electrolyte with a minimum of organic additives and adequate bath agitation comprising sonication, i. e. the exposure of the bath to high-frequency sound waves. Well-dispersed hard particles (titanium oxide and silicon carbide) were incorporated in nickel films. The focus was set on the correlation between the gained microstructure of the composites with particles from micron to nanometre scale and the electrochemical and mechanical properties. Corrosion was quantified from polarisation curves and volumetric erosion measurements. Wear resistance was evaluated by scratch energy density studies, oscillating sliding wear testing and cavitation wear testing and compared to indentation hardness results. Sonication and particle downsizing result in matrix grain refinement and dispersion hardening. Incorporation of different particles with respect to different material and size proved to meet different demands. Submicron TiO 2 is best for high corrosion resistance, sonicated nickel without particle incorporation is best for high abrasion resistance, nano TiO 2 is best for oscillating sliding wear resistance and submicron SiC is best for cavitation wear resistance...|$|R
40|$|The bis(triphenylphosphine) nickel dichloride-catalyzed {{reaction}} of thiophenols and aryl sulfides with phenyl-magnesium and methylmagnesium bromides produced biphenyls and toluenes, respectively. The coupling of p-t-butylthioanisole with ethylmagnesium bromide and cyclohexylmagnesium bromide {{in the presence}} of (1, 3 -diphenylphosphinopropane) nickel dichloride produced p-t-butylethylbenzene and p-t-butylcyclohexylbenzene, respectively, while the coupling with isopropylmagnesium bromide led to the formatin of n-propyl as well as isopropyl aryl derivatives. The same sulfide reacted with isopropylmagnesium and cyclohexylmagnesium bromides {{in the presence of}} anhydrous nickel dichloride and triphenylphosphine to produce t-butyl-benzene. With ethylmagnesium bromide t-butylbenzene and p-t-ethylbutylbenzene were produced. p-t-Butylthiophenol afforded t-butylbenzene as the sole product, when treated with isopropylmagnesium <b>bromide,</b> <b>nickel</b> dichloride and triphenylphosphine, and t-butylbenzene as the major product, when treated with isopropylmagnesium bromide and (1, 3 -diphenylphosphinopropane) nickel dichloride. Ketenethioacetal C(, 6) H(, 5) CH(, 2) CH=C(SEt) (, 2) underwent reaction with Grignard reagents in the presence of phosphine-nickel complexes to produce vinyl sulfides in which the alkyl group is oriented trans to the initial benzyl group. When exposed to an excess of methylmagnesium bromide and (1, 3 -diphenylphosphinopropane) nickel dichloride, the thioacetal produced 1 -phenyl- 3 -methyl- 2 -butene. Reaction of enol sulfides of ketones with Grignard reagents {{in the presence of the}} aforementioned nickel catalyst produced di- and tri-substituted olefins with retention of configuration at the sulfur-bearing olefinic carbon site. The reaction between 1, 1 -diethylthioethylene and phenylmagnesium bromide in the presence of nickel dichloride and triphenylphosphine led to (alpha) -ethylthio styrene, 1, 1 -diphenylethene and unreacted ketenethioacetal...|$|R
40|$|The {{oxidative}} addition of highly reactive zinc (Zn*) to organic bromides shows pronounced structure-reactivity dependence, {{in contrast to}} that shown by magnesium. The kinetic and LFER studies conducted suggest a mechanism in which electron transfer is the rate-determining step of the reaction. Experiments carried out with radical clocks and stereochemical investigations support the presence of radicals. The reactivity profiles suggest that the electron transfer occurs in the normal Marcus region. In the case of aryl bromides, Hammett plots are consistent with participation of aryl halide radical anions as intermediates and again show a qualitative adherence to Marcus theory. The reaction proposed here {{can be described as}} another example of radical mediated selective reaction, and it has straightforward synthetic applications. ^ While there are other examples in the literature of the addition of dialkyl zinc reagents, organozinc cuprates, and allylic organozinc halides to imines, to our knowledge we report here the first addition of a non-allylic organozinc halide across a carbon-nitrogen double bond. Addition of organozinc halides to N-benzyl bensensulfonimine with a copper catalyst under mild conditions gives the corresponding sulfonamide. Alkyl, ester, cyclic, vinylic, and heterocyclic organozincs give moderate to good yields, but best results are obtained with benzylic organozinc species. This type of reaction is currently limited to sulfonimines and is not successful with other carbon-nitrogen double bonds. ^ The {{oxidative addition}} of highly reactive <b>nickel</b> to organic <b>bromides</b> shows only slight structure-reactivity dependence. This is in contrast to the behavior shown by oxidative addition of nickel (0) complexes and is counter to what Marcus theory predicts comparative to zinc. The Hammett relationship is determined for the addition of active nickel and the anomalous behavior is attributed to surface effects involving precursor complex formation, the activated complex, and temperature. ...|$|R
40|$|With {{the upper}} {{temperature}} limit of the Ni-based superalloys attained, {{a new class of}} materials is required. Intermetallics appear as likely candidates because of their attractive physical properties. With a relatively low density, high thermal conductivity, excellent oxidation resistance, high melting point, and <b>simple</b> crystal structure, <b>nickel</b> aluminide (NiAl) appears to be a potential candidate. However, NiAl is limited in structural applications due to its low room temperature fracture toughness and poor elevated temperature strength. One approach to improving these properties has been through the application of eutectic composites. Researchers have shown that containerless directional solidification of NiAl-based eutectic alloys can provide improvement in both the creep strength and fracture toughness. Although these systems have shown improvements in the mechanical properties, the presence of refractory metals increases the density significantly in some alloys. Lower density systems, such as the carbides, nitrides, and borides, may provide NiAl-based eutectic structure. With little or no information available on these systems, experimental investigation is required. The objective of this research was to locate and develop NiAl-carbide eutectic alloys. Exploratory arc-melts were performed in NiAl-refractory metal-C systems. Refractory metal systems investigated included Co, Cr, Fe, Hf, Mo, Nb, Ta, Ti, W, and Zr. Systems containing carbides with excellent stability (i. e.,HfC, NbC, TaC, TiC, and ZrC) produced large blocky cubic carbides in an NiAl matrix. The carbides appeared to have formed in the liquid state and were randomly distributed throughout the polycrystalline NiAl. The Co, Cr, Fe, Mo, and W systems contained NiAl dendrites with a two-phase interdendritic microconstituent present. Of these systems, the NiAl-Mo-C system had the most promising microstructure for in-situ composites. Three processing techniques were used to evaluate the NiAl-Mo-C system: arc-melting, slow cooling, and containerless directional solidification. Arc-melting provided a wide range of compositions in an economical and simple fashion. The slow cooled ingots provided larger ingots and slower cooling rates than arc-melting. Directional solidification was used to produce in-situ composites consisting of NiAl reinforced with molybdenum carbides...|$|R
