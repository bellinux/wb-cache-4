Mars is less dense than Earth, having about 15% of Earth's volume and 11% of Earth's mass, resulting in about 38% of Earth's surface gravity. The red-orange appearance of the Martian surface is caused by iron(III) oxide, or rust. It can look like butterscotch; other common surface colors include golden, brown, tan, and greenish, depending on the minerals present.|$|E

5|$|After {{screening}} at the Screamfest Horror Film Festival on October 20, 2007, Boogeyman 2 {{was released}} direct-to-video in the United States on January 8, 2008; {{it was later}} released theatrically in Russia and Italy. It received mixed reviews from critics, although many of them considered {{it to be a}} general improvement over its predecessor. Attention was especially given to the human-like nature of the Boogeyman in the film, which reviewers felt was preferable to monsters in other contemporary creature features, including the previous film. Despite a mediocre commercial performance, recouping <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> its budget, the film received a sequel, Boogeyman 3, the following year.|$|E

The busway opened on September 9, 2003 and 21 MBTA Bus routes were rerouted from Central Square. In late 2005, the MBTA spent $168,000 for repairs to the garage roof, which frequently leaked during rain. The 1992 station was built with new concrete ties supporting the tracks connecting to the station, which proved less durable than expected. In September 2008, the MBTA board authorized a $1 million tie replacement and slope stabilization project at the station.|$|E

40|$|Stuart Rachels and Larry Temkin {{have put}} forward a number of alleged counterexamples to the transitivity of the {{relation}} “all things considered better than”. 1 Several of these cases share a common structure. 2 A representative example by Rachels is as follows: Each outcome in [this] counterexample involves a single person’s experience: A: 1 year of excruciating agony. B: 100 years of pain <b>slightly</b> (or somewhat) <b>less</b> intense <b>than</b> the pain in A. C: 10, 000 years of pain <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> intense <b>than</b> the pain in B. D: 1 million years of pain <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> intense <b>than</b> the pain in C. Y: 1 × 10 48 years of pain <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> intense <b>than</b> the pain in X. Z: 1 × 10 50 years of pain <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> intense <b>than</b> the mild pain in Y. […] Although A is worse than Z, the example creates a path from A to Z involving only changes for the worse. These changes are for the worse because increasing a pain’s duration 100 -fold offsets reducing its intensity slightly, or even somewhat. So the outcomes get worse until they are better, contradicting Tran...|$|R

5|$|Louis XVIII ruled as king for <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> a decade. The Bourbon Restoration {{regime was}} a {{constitutional}} monarchy (unlike the ancien régime, which was absolutist). As a constitutional monarch, Louis XVIII's royal prerogative was reduced substantially by the Charter of 1814, France's new constitution. Louis had no children; therefore, upon his death, the crown passed to his brother, Charles, Count of Artois. Louis XVIII {{was the last}} French monarch to die while reigning, as his successor Charles X (1824–1830) abdicated and both Louis Philippe I (1830–1848) and Napoléon III (1852–1870) were deposed.|$|E
5|$|Other {{aspects of}} feeding include the eyes, arms, and legs. The {{shape of the}} skull of Allosaurus limited {{potential}} binocular vision to 20° of width, <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> that of modern crocodilians. As with crocodilians, {{this may have been}} enough to judge prey distance and time attacks. The arms, compared with those of other theropods, were suited for both grasping prey at a distance or clutching it close, and the articulation of the claws suggests that they could have been used to hook things. Finally, the top speed of Allosaurus has been estimated at 30 to 55kilometers per hour (19 to 34miles per hour).|$|E

5|$|According to the 1931 census, {{the territories}} of Bačka and Baranja had a {{combined}} population of 837,742. This included between 275,014 and 283,114 Hungarians, and between 185,458 and 194,908 Volksdeutsche. Hungarians therefore made up around {{one-third of the}} population of these territories, with the Volksdeutsche comprising <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> one-quarter. According to the historian Dr. Krisztián Ungváry, the 1931 census showed that the population of Bačka and Baranja included 150,301 Serbs and 3,099 Croats. This corresponds to a Serb population of about 18 per cent. These figures vary considerably from the combined Serb and Croat population of 305,917 provided by Professor Jozo Tomasevich, corresponding to 36.5 per cent of the population. The 1931 census figures for Međimurje and Prekmurje show a total population of 193,640, of which 101,467 (52.2 per cent) were Croats, 75,064 (38.7 per cent) were Slovenes, and 15,308 (8 per cent) were Hungarians.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 18th century, the Bastille {{had come to}} {{separate}} the more aristocratic quarter of Le Marais in the old city from the working class district of the faubourg Saint-Antoine that lay beyond the Louis XIV boulevard. The Marais was a fashionable area, frequented by foreign visitors and tourists, but few went beyond the Bastille into the faubourg. The faubourg was characterised by its built-up, densely populated areas, particularly in the north, and its numerous workshops producing soft furnishings. Paris as a whole had continued to grow, reaching <b>slightly</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 800,000 inhabitants by the reign of Louis XVI, {{and many of the}} residents around the faubourg had migrated to Paris from the countryside relatively recently.
