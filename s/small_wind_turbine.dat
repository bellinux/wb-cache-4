5|$|Off-grid system {{users can}} either adapt to {{intermittent}} power or use batteries, photovoltaic or diesel systems {{to supplement the}} wind turbine. Equipment such as parking meters, traffic warning signs, street lighting, or wireless Internet gateways may be powered by a <b>small</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine,</b> possibly combined with a photovoltaic system, that charges a small battery replacing {{the need for a}} connection to the power grid.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{wind and}} wave, tidal power is an {{inherently}} predictable source. However {{the technology is}} in its infancy and numerous devices are in the prototype stages. Today {{it is known that}} a tall tubular tower with three blades attached to it is the typical profile of a wind turbine, but twenty-five years ago there were a wide variety of different systems being tested. This is the current situation with regard to tidal power. Some systems capture energy from the tides in a vertical direction. The tide comes in and raises the water level in a basin. As the tide lowers the water in the basin is discharged through a turbine. Tidal stream power captures energy from the flow of tides, usually using underwater plant resembling a <b>small</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine.</b> An example is Marine Current Turbines SeaGen 1.2MW device at Strangford Lough in Northern Ireland, which is the largest tidal stream turbine in the world. To date the only two installed tidal power plants of notable size are the Sihwa Lake Tidal Power Station in Gyeonggi Province, South Korea and the Rance Tidal Power Station in Brittany, France, rated at 254 MW and 240 MW respectively. There are also many small scale projects throughout the world.|$|E

40|$|The {{transition}} to a fossil free energy supply in Denmark resulted in the Energy Agreement of 2012. All the parliamentary parties except the Liberal Alliance decided that the Danish electricity production in 2020 should consist of 50 % wind power. The Energy Agreement focuses on large <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> either offshore or onshore and {{the goal is to}} add 2. 000 MW to the national grid. At the same time solar cells received a lot of attention because of a beneficial economic scheme. As result 92. 000 new solar plants was erected {{in a short period of}} time costing the Danish state more than expected. In the midst of this one could find <b>small</b> <b>wind</b> turbines; <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> of up to 25 meters and with a capacity of maximum 25 kW used for mainly private consumption. The economic scheme of solar cells also applied for <b>small</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines,</b> but only 300 plants were erected in the same period. This thesis examines why this is the case by answering the following problem statement: What opportunities and challenges are there for <b>small</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> in Denmark and how should a strategy be designed to ensure that <b>small</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine’s</b> energy potential is utilised? Based on the municipality of Randers, the actual potential for <b>small</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> is analysed using GIS. The result is that it is possible to place far more <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> than the 15 that are currently placed in Randers. The analysis takes into account both the required distances and wind and terrain conditions. Opportunities and challenges for <b>small</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> are then defined as the rules are today, and based on backcasting, three different scenarios are analysed. This analysis is used to develop a strategy for how to utilise the full potential of <b>small</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines.</b> The conclusion is that <b>small</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> could be included more efficiently in the overall energy planning, and thus help to achieve the objectives of the Energy Agreement. However, this requires that the rules for <b>small</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> are standardised and that all relevant stakeholders are willing to use resources to define a real target for <b>small</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines.</b> If this is not the case, then the deployment of <b>small</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> will stall, and precious kilowatts lost will be lost...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} {{demonstrate}} {{that the presence of}} atmospheric turbulence at the test site is particularly important when evaluating <b>small</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines.</b> Unlike utility grade <b>wind</b> <b>turbines,</b> the <b>smaller</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> are often placed on shorter towers, {{in a wide variety of}} landscapes, and often in less than optimal locations. These factors combine to create a wide range of turbulent environments in which the <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> are expected to perform. Therefore, it is important that the power performance testing standard for <b>small</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> should adequately address the influence that the atmospheric turbulence has on expected power performanc...|$|R

40|$|<b>Small</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> have an {{enormous}} potential for decentralized electricity generation. In recent years, {{there has been an}} increasing worldwide interest in <b>small</b> <b>wind</b> systems. But so far, there is no flourishing international market for <b>small</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines.</b> Among the reasons for this are high up-front costs, insufficient technological maturity, misleading product information, the complex non-transparent market and the poor performance of many <b>small</b> <b>wind</b> systems. Nevertheless, <b>small</b> <b>wind</b> projects can be successful. Key requirements for this are a solid assessment of the wind resource, a thoughtful selection of the turbine type as well as proper siting.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the diffusion of}} <b>small</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> in Denmark, and explores which barriers that arises {{in the process of}} adopting <b>small</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> by people living in rural zones. Based on Everett M. Rogers’ theory “Diffusion of Innovation” and Würstenhagen et al. ’s theory and study of social acceptance we seek to categorize the barriers we discovered in a triangular model of dimensions defined as society-, innovation- and adoption-based barriers. The study contains qualitative interviews involving potential adopters and owners of <b>small</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> which we analyse and from the data collected we determine the different barriers. Finally we discuss possible solutions to these barriers according to the different adoption groups. We discover the primary barrier to be the economic aspect of adopting the innovation. No matter environmental motivation, vision and relative advantages such as independency and self-sufficiency, no potential adopter is capable of adopting the innovation, if the <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> are not cost-effective. Because of this we conclude that for the <b>small</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> to diffuse in Denmark it is vital that the government keep the existing legislation, keeping the net settlement system (nettoafregningsordning) ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Small</b> <b>wind</b> power {{industry}} in Italy had its kick-start in 2009, after the Government implemented two measures introducing both the simplified regime and incentive rates for <b>small</b> <b>wind</b> power plants.

25|$|<b>Small</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> may be {{used for}} a variety of {{applications}} including on- or off-grid residences, telecom towers, offshore platforms, rural schools and clinics, remote monitoring and other purposes that require energy where there is no electric grid, or where the grid is unstable. <b>Small</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> may be as small as a fifty-watt generator for boat or caravan use. Hybrid solar and wind powered units are increasingly being used for traffic signage, particularly in rural locations, as they avoid the need to lay long cables from the nearest mains connection point. The U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) defines <b>small</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbines</b> as those <b>smaller</b> than or equal to 100 kilowatts. Small units often have direct drive generators, direct current output, aeroelastic blades, lifetime bearings and use a vane to point into the wind.|$|R

50|$|Another {{application}} is in small wind technology. Although most of wind turbines use three-phase generators, single-phase generators {{are found in}} some of the <b>small</b> <b>wind</b> <b>turbine</b> models with rated power outputs of up with 55 kW.
