5|$|Even {{in studies}} {{restricted}} to postsynaptic events, investigators have not determined {{the location of}} the protein <b>synthesis</b> that underlies L-LTP. Specifically, it is unclear whether protein <b>synthesis</b> takes place in the postsynaptic cell body or in its dendrites. Despite having observed ribosomes (the major components of the protein <b>synthesis</b> machinery) in dendrites as early as the 1960s, prevailing wisdom was that the cell body was the predominant site of protein <b>synthesis</b> in neurons. This reasoning was not seriously challenged until the 1980s, when investigators reported observing protein <b>synthesis</b> in dendrites whose connection to their cell body had been severed. More recently, investigators have demonstrated that this type of local protein <b>synthesis</b> is necessary for some types of LTP.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to organic solid-phase <b>synthesis</b> and peptide <b>synthesis,</b> the <b>synthesis</b> of oligonucleotides proceeds best on non-swellable or low-swellable solid supports. The two {{most often used}} solid-phase materials are controlled pore glass (CPG) and macroporous polystyrene (MPPS).|$|E
5|$|Network <b>synthesis</b> filters. The {{mathematical}} {{bases of}} network <b>synthesis</b> were {{laid in the}} 1930s and 1940s. After the end of World War II network <b>synthesis</b> became the primary tool of filter design. Network <b>synthesis</b> put filter design on a firm mathematical foundation, freeing it from the mathematically sloppy techniques of image design and severing the connection with physical lines. The essence of network <b>synthesis</b> is that it produces a design that will (at least if implemented with ideal components) accurately reproduce the response originally specified in black box terms.|$|E

5|$|One {{reason for}} the {{popularity}} of the local protein <b>synthesis</b> hypothesis is that it provides a possible mechanism for the specificity associated with LTP. Specifically, if indeed local protein <b>synthesis</b> underlies L-LTP, only dendritic spines receiving LTP-inducing stimuli will undergo LTP; the potentiation will not be propagated to adjacent synapses. By contrast, global protein <b>synthesis</b> that occurs in the cell body requires that proteins be shipped out to every area of the cell, including synapses that have not received LTP-inducing stimuli. Whereas local protein <b>synthesis</b> provides a mechanism for specificity, global protein <b>synthesis</b> would seem to directly compromise it. However, as discussed later, the synaptic tagging hypothesis successfully reconciles global protein <b>synthesis,</b> synapse specificity, and associativity.|$|E
5|$|All {{corticosteroid}} hormones share cholesterol as {{a common}} precursor. Therefore, {{the first step in}} steroidogenesis is cholesterol uptake or <b>synthesis.</b> Cells that produce steroid hormones can acquire cholesterol through two paths. The main source is through dietary cholesterol transported via the blood as cholesterol esters within low density lipoproteins (LDL). LDL enters the cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. The other source of cholesterol is <b>synthesis</b> in the cell's endoplasmic reticulum. <b>Synthesis</b> can compensate when LDL levels are abnormally low. In the lysosome, cholesterol esters are converted to free cholesterol, which is then used for steroidogenesis or stored in the cell.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the local}} protein <b>synthesis</b> {{hypothesis}} gained significant support, there was general {{agreement that the}} protein <b>synthesis</b> underlying L-LTP occurred in the cell body. Further, there was thought that the products of this <b>synthesis</b> were shipped cell-wide in a nonspecific manner. It thus became necessary to explain how protein <b>synthesis</b> could occur in the cell body without compromising LTP's input specificity. The synaptic tagging hypothesis attempts to solve the cell's difficult problem of synthesizing proteins in the cell body but ensuring they only reach synapses that have received LTP-inducing stimuli.|$|E

5|$|Currently, {{solid-phase}} oligonucleotide <b>synthesis</b> {{is carried}} out automatically using computer-controlled instruments (oligonucleotide synthesizers) and is technically implemented in column, multi-well plate, and array formats. The column format is best suited for research and large scale applications where a high-throughput is not required. Multi-well plate format is designed specifically for high-throughput <b>synthesis</b> on small scale to satisfy the growing demand of industry and academia for synthetic oligonucleotides.

5|$|In {{solid-phase}} <b>synthesis,</b> an oligonucleotide being assembled is covalently bound, via its 3'-terminal hydroxy group, to a {{solid support}} material and remains {{attached to it}} over the entire course of the chain assembly. The solid support is contained in columns whose dimensions depend {{on the scale of}} <b>synthesis</b> and may vary between 0.05mL and several liters. The overwhelming majority of oligonucleotides are synthesized on small scale ranging from 10nmol to 1μmol. More recently, high-throughput oligonucleotide <b>synthesis</b> where the solid support is contained in the wells of multi-well plates (most often, 96 or 384 wells per plate) became a method of choice for parallel <b>synthesis</b> of oligonucleotides on small scale. At the end of the chain assembly, the oligonucleotide is released from the solid support and is eluted from the column or the well.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Alexander Todd’s group pioneered H-phosphonate and {{phosphate}} triester methods of oligonucleotide <b>synthesis.</b> The reaction of compounds 1 and 2 to form H-phosphonate diester 3 is an H-phosphonate coupling in solution while that of compounds 4 and 5 to give 6 is a phosphotriester coupling (see phosphotriester <b>synthesis</b> below).|$|E

5|$|Late LTP (L-LTP) is {{the natural}} {{extension}} of E-LTP. Unlike E-LTP, which is independent of protein <b>synthesis,</b> L-LTP requires gene transcription and protein <b>synthesis</b> in the postsynaptic cell. Two phases of L-LTP exist: the first depends upon protein <b>synthesis,</b> while the second depends upon both gene transcription and protein <b>synthesis.</b> These phases are occasionally called LTP2 and LTP3, respectively, with E-LTP referred to as LTP1 under this nomenclature.|$|E

5|$|Oligonucleotide <b>synthesis</b> is the {{chemical}} <b>synthesis</b> of relatively short fragments of nucleic acids with defined chemical structure (sequence).
