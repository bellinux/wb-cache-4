2500|$|The {{cause for}} this [...] is the {{separation}} of the flow from the blade surfaces. This effect {{can be explained by the}} flow over an air foil. When the angle of incidence increases (during the low velocity flow) at the [...] entrance of the air foil, flow pattern changes and separation occurs. This is the first stage of stalling and through this separation point the flow separates leading to the formation of vortices, back flow in the <b>separated</b> <b>region.</b> For a further the explanation of stall and rotating stall, refer to compressor surge. The stall zone for the single axial fan and axial fans operated in parallel are shown in the figure.|$|E

40|$|Two {{recent works}} suggest a {{possibility}} of sending signals to a space-like <b>separated</b> <b>region,</b> contrary {{to the spirit of}} special relativity. In the first work [J.

Together with the possibility of changing the relative phase in a nonlocal way using potential effect we, apparently, have a method of sending signals to space-like separated regions. These arguments are critically analyzed in this paper. Comment: 6 pages. Contribution to the "Mysteries and Paradoxes in Quantum Mechanics", Garda Lake 200...|$|E
40|$|A passive {{flow control}} on a generic car model was {{experimentally}} studied. This control {{consists of a}} deflector placed on the upper edge of the model rear window. The study {{was carried out in}} a wind tunnel at Reynolds numbers based on the model height of 3. 1 Ã— 105 and 7. 7 Ã— 105. The flow was investigated via standard and stereoscopic particle image velocimetry, Kiel pressure probes and surface flow visualization. The aerodynamic drag was measured using an external balance and calculated using a wake survey method. Drag reductions up to 9 % were obtained depending on the deflector angle. The deflector increases the <b>separated</b> <b>region</b> on the rear window. The results show that when this <b>separated</b> <b>region</b> is wide enough, it disrupts the development of the counter-rotating longitudinal vortices appearing on the lateral edges of the rear window.

40|$|It {{is known}} that the {{boundary}} layer along {{the roof of a}} waterjet intake is likely to separate when the boat is moving at relatively high speed and this impairs the overall performance of the waterjet unit.

40|$|It {{has been}} more than 50 years since NASA {{engineers}} have attempted to design a manned space vehicle with the capability to return from beyond low Earth orbit. In this interval, our methodologies for designing the thermal protection system (TPS) to protect humans from the extremely high temperatures of re-entry have changed significantly. With these considerations in mind, we return to the Apollo IV (AS- 501) flight data. This incredible data set allows us to assess the current tools and methodologies being used to design Orion MPCV. In particular, our ability to predict the aftbody <b>separated</b> <b>region</b> convective heating environments for MPCV is critical. The design uses reusable TPS in this area, whereas Apollo designers used ablative TPS which can withstand much more severe environments.

40|$|We {{investigate}} an asymptotic {{model of}} DiPrima & Stuart (1972 b, 1975) describing steady Taylor vortex flow between eccentric cylinders, {{under the assumption}} that the eccentricity epsilon, the clearance ratio delta and the Taylor vortex amplitude A satisfy epsilon, delta and A small. By solving a boundary value problem for the radial eigenfunctions we numerically obtain the flow field of DiPrima & Stuart and investigate its topology, after correcting higher-order terms to ensure that the flow preserves volume. We find regions of chaotic streamlines at all eccentricities and discuss the reason for their existence. We make an analogy between the full model and a modulated vortex flow field which qualitatively displays the same behaviour. For large eccentricities, we examine the flow field and the topology of its streamlines, especially where the two-dimensional flow contains a <b>separated</b> <b>region</b> of recirculation In this case Taylor vortices give rise to transport of fluid particles {{in and out of the}} <b>separated</b> <b>region.</b> We find that the onset of Taylor vortices encourages recirculation in the inflow plane, whilst discouraging it in the outflow plane...|$|E
