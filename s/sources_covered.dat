5000|$|The Acámbaro {{figures were}} {{uncovered}} by a German immigrant and hardware merchant named Waldemar Julsrud. According to Dennis Swift, a young-Earth creationist and major {{proponent of the}} figures, Julsrud stumbled upon the figures while riding his horse and hired a local farmer to dig up the remaining figures, paying him for each figure he brought back. Eventually, the farmer and his assistants brought him over 32,000 figures which included representations of everything from the supposed dinosaurs to peoples {{from all over the}} world including Egyptians, Sumerians, and [...] "bearded Caucasians". The figures attracted little attention from scholars and scientists, and when Julsrud began to assert that they were accurate representations of dinosaurs created by an ancient society, he only alienated himself further from serious scientific investigation.

40|$|New Emissions Inventory Improvement Program (EIIP) {{guidance}} {{on the development}} of emission inventories for anthropogenic sources of ammonia (NH 3) has been developed (Roe et al, 2004 a). The purpose of this new emissions guidance for “anthropogenic sources ” is to update the materials presented in a 1994 U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report on estimating ammonia emissions (Battye et al, 1994). Updated guidance is available for estimating ammonia emissions from industrial sources, combustion sources, and miscellaneous sources. For the purposes of this guidance, the term “anthropogenic sources, ” excludes emissions from the agricultural sector (e. g., fertilizer application, livestock operations), as well as natural sources (e. g., soils, wild animal populations). As compared to dominant NH 3 sources such as livestock operations, the anthropogenic <b>sources</b> <b>covered</b> in this guidance are estimated to contribute small amounts to national and regional annual inventories. However, at smaller spatial and temporal scales (e. g., urban), the <b>sources</b> <b>covered</b> in this guidance can make significant contributions to an ammonia emissions inventory. The scope of this work was limited to the identification and documentation of readily-available emissions data. A literature review was performed; however, no testing programs were conducted in support of this project. The primary objective of this guidance is to provide updated information to developers of regional NH 3 inventories in support of air quality modeling...|$|E

30|$|The {{choice of}} an {{appropriate}} method for identification and weighting of spatial and spatiotemporal relationships {{is a critical}} requirement for urban traffic forecasting. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, there are no methodologies or guidelines for solving this problem. A list of bibliographic <b>sources,</b> <b>covered</b> by this review, contains a very limited number of research studies where different approaches to identify spatiotemporal relationships were compared and proper conclusions regarding their applicability were made. Thus, development of guidelines for spatiotemporal FSE is an important advantage that could not be properly accomplished on the basis of our literature review. The best result is noting the actual method choice made by researchers, and assuming that this choice is well-grounded and optimal for the analysed spatial settings (which in general may not be true).|$|E
