40|$|During the {{construction}} {{stage of a}} building with high clearances, large spans and thick slabs, the isolated <b>tower</b> <b>scaffolds</b> which have higher load-carrying capacity are often considered {{to serve as the}} falsework and meet the load demand of the building. Because isolated <b>tower</b> <b>scaffolds</b> served as temporary supports are immediately removed after finishing {{the construction}} stage, the importance is often neglected. Up to now, the information on the structural design of isolated <b>tower</b> <b>scaffolds</b> has been rather scarce, and the assembly of isolated <b>tower</b> <b>scaffolds</b> on construction sites still relies mainly on the experienced workers.

40|$|The main {{instrumentation}} platform {{consisted of}} eddy correlation sensors {{mounted on a}} <b>scaffold</b> <b>tower</b> at a height of 4. 2 m above the peat surface. The sensors were attached to a boom assembly which could be rotated into the prevailing winds. The boom assembly was mounted on a movable sled which, when extended, allowed sensors {{to be up to}} 2 m away from the scaffolding structure to minimize flow distortion. When retracted, the sensors could easily be installed, serviced or rotated. An electronic level with linear actuators allowed the sensors to be remotely levelled once the sled was extended. Two instrument arrays were installed. A primary (fast-response) array consisted of a three-dimensional sonic anemometer, a methane sensor (tunable diode laser spectrometer), a carbon dioxide/water vapor sensor, a fine wire thermocouple and a backup one-dimensional sonic anemometer. The secondary array consisted of a one-dimensional sonic anemometer, a fine wire thermocouple and a Krypton hygrometer. Descriptions of these sensors may be found in other reports (e. g., Verma; Suyker and Verma). Slow-response sensors provided supporting measurements including mean air temperature and humidity, mean horizontal windspeed and direction, incoming and reflected solar radiation, net radiation, incoming and reflected photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), soil heat flux, peat temperature, water-table elevation and precipitation. A data acquisition system (consisting of an IBM compatible microcomputer, amplifiers and a 16 bit analog-to-digital converter), housed in a small trailer, was used to record the fast response signals. These signals were low-pass filtered (using 8 -pole Butterworth active filters with a 12. 5 Hz cutoff frequency) and sampled at 25 Hz. Slow-response signals were sampled every 5 s using a network of CR 21 X (Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan Utah) data loggers installed in the fen.

40|$|On {{account of}} {{logistical}} problems {{arising from the}} impossibility of erecting adequate scaffolding that would allow for an inspection of the building's upper, and therefore inaccessible, elevations, a movable <b>scaffold</b> <b>tower</b> was employed {{to carry out a}} direct inspection of the stone built portions of the temple's four external elevations. The drawings/plans of the building produced in this way were then mounted, and subsequently integrated with already existing ichonographical documentation of the entire monumental complex. In this way it was possible to arrive at a reliable graphic representation of the structure which could be referred to during successive analytical phases of the project. Contemporaneously, a comprehensive photographic record of the building was created; this was realised on the one hand to illustrate the figurative and spatial characteristics of the monument as a whole, including details of the same (i. e. architectonic images), and on the other to furnish technical backup for the execution of a graphical survey of the building, and to aid the study of its physical characteristics and any degradation phenomena observed. The word 'survey' is widely understood to mean the two clearly identifiable and successive steps involved in the examination of a structure, these being the actual surveying procedure, followed by the graphic rendering that describes and represents the building by means of eminently clear diagrams. The term 'survey' as used here refers to a thorough and systematic investigation carried out in the field, contemporaneous with the immediate, precise and effective rendering on paper and/or in computerized form of the data collected. This method allows for an accurate and reliable investigation to be carried out of the building and all its individual components, and the relationship between these parts. In addition, it provides a firm base and support for checks that may be performed in the future, and any thorough assessment regarding the building's architectural and structural configuration. Based on the survey drawings, the next step performed was the sampling of the various forms of degradation observed, and the macroscopic mapping of these. Maps were made of the building's four elevations. To achieve this goal, effective graphic devices were used that could readily be overlaid, and which would allow for the specification, localization and circumscription of the various areas/types of deterioration, including the juxtaposition and intermingling of these. Finally, exclusively for the building's main elevation, a more accurate graphical rendering of the macroscopic degradation diagnosis was prepared, which was intended to serve as an example of an up-to-date, critical and specifically targeted application of the recent UNI 11 - 182 / 2006 norm. A further step, which benefited from a considerable body of photographic documentation of the various states of deterioration observed (showing their locations, brief descriptions of the same, and the identification of possible causes), was the creation of 'case history' to refer to in future in-depth scientific investigations. This will also be relevant for a sampling plan, non-destructive investigations, and tests to be carried out in a laboratory in order to gain greater and more precise understanding of the phenomena (sometimes very exact knowledge). These verifications are to be to correlated with the systematic 'reading' described above that consists in a macroscopic diagnosis, carried out by means of a very attentive visual scrutiny...|$|E

Since the size scale of micromachined structures meshes well with that of cells, MEMS technology can be utilized for this application. In this work, three-dimensional (3 -D) scaffolds have been generated for 3 -D cell culturing. The scaffolds consist of high-aspect-ratio SU- 8 towers (for high surface area) and towers with three-dimensional cross connect ‘bridges’, extending from tower to tower, which form highly complex structures for <b>scaffolds.</b> <b>Towers</b> and cross-connects of several dimensions have been tested to find optimal structures of scaffolds for cell culturing. Typical sizes for towers range from 500 ~ 700 µm in height and 50 ~ 250 µm in diameter.

50|$|The opening episode {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the natural history of the region, introducing some of the themes that are explored in more detail in later programmes. The South Pacific covers a vast area, and less than 1% is land, ranging from the Hawaiian Islands north of the equator to New Zealand in the south. On Macquarie Island, the most southerly outpost before Antarctica, springtime sees the arrival of huge numbers of elephant seals. Aerial footage shows the entire world population of royal penguins, which nest here in a single colony. Cold ocean currents flow {{all the way to the}} Galápagos Islands, 8000 miles away, enabling sea lions and penguins to survive on the equator. Isolation has enabled the region's wildlife to evolve in unusual ways. On Metoma, robber crabs, the world's largest terrestrial invertebrates, are filmed massing at night to feed on coconuts. On Hawaii, the most isolated archipelago of all, the caterpillars have turned carnivorous. There is an incredible diversity of human cultures and customs too, despite colonisation taking place relatively recently. The men of Pentecost Island leap from timber <b>scaffold</b> <b>towers</b> with only a vine tied to their ankles to break their falls. On small islands such as Anuta, people have fostered strong communities and sustainable hunting, farming and fishing practices to make up for the limited availability of food.

6000|$|... {{like that}} wielded by the awful shape which Dion the Syracusan saw? I make the {{suggestion}} modestly, though somewhat encouraged by Mr. Masson's system of exegesis, which reminds {{one of the}} casuists' doctrine of probables, in virtue of which a man may be probabiliter obligatus and probabiliter deobligatus at the same time. But perhaps the most remarkable instance of Mr. Masson's figures of speech {{is where we are}} told that the king might have established a bona fide government [...] "by giving public ascendency to the popular or Parliamentary element in his Council, and inducing the old leaven in it either to accept the new policy, or to withdraw and become inactive." [...] There is something consoling in the thought that yeast should be accessible to moral suasion. It is really too bad that bread should ever be heavy for want of such an appeal to its moral sense as should [...] "induce it to accept the new policy." [...] Of Mr. Masson's unhappy infection with the vivid style an instance or two shall be given in justification of what has been alleged against him in that particular. He says of London that [...] "he was committed to the Tower, where for more than two months he lay, with as near a prospect as ever prisoner had of a chop with the executioner's axe on a <b>scaffold</b> on <b>Tower</b> Hill." [...] I may be over-fastidious, but the word [...] "chop" [...] offends my ears with its coarseness, or if that be too strong, has certainly the unpleasant effect of an emphasis unduly placed. Old Auchinleck's saying of Cromwell, that [...] "he gart kings ken they had a lith in their necks," [...] {{is a good example of}} really vivid phrase, suggesting the axe and the block, and giving one of those dreadful hints to the imagination which are more powerful than any amount of detail, and whose skilful use is the only magic employed by the masters of truly picturesque writing. The sentence just quoted will serve also as an example of that tendency to surplusage, which adds to the bulk of Mr. Masson's sentences at the cost of their effectiveness. If he had said simply [...] "chop on Tower Hill" [...] (if chop there must be), it had been quite enough, for we all know that the executioner's axe and the scaffold are implied in it. Once more, and I have done with the least agreeable part of my business. Mr. Masson, after telling over again the story of Strafford with needless length of detail, ends thus: [...] "On Wednesday, the 12th of May, that proud curly head, the casket of that brain of power, rolled on the <b>scaffold</b> of <b>Tower</b> Hill." [...] Why curly? Surely it is here a ludicrous impertinence. This careful thrusting forward of outward and unmeaning particulars, in the hope of giving that reality to a picture which genius only has the art to do, is becoming a weariness in modern descriptive writing. It reminds one of the Mrs. Jarley expedient of dressing the waxen effigies of murderers in the very clothes they wore when they did the deed, or with the real halter round their necks wherewith they expiated it. It is probably very effective with the torpid sensibilities of the class who look upon wax figures as works of art. True imaginative power works with other material. Lady Macbeth striving to wash away from her hands the damned spot that is all the more there to the mind of the spectator because it is not there at all, is a type of the methods it employs and the intensity of their action.|$|R
60|$|They {{tried to}} persuade Lady Jane to accept the unreformed religion; but she {{steadily}} refused. On the morning when she was to die, she saw from her window the bleeding and headless body of her husband brought back in a cart from the <b>scaffold</b> on <b>Tower</b> Hill where he had laid down his life. But, as she had declined to see him before his execution, lest she should be overpowered and not make a good end, so, she even now showed a constancy and calmness {{that will never be}} forgotten. She came up to the scaffold with a firm step and a quiet face, and addressed the bystanders in a steady voice. They were not numerous; for she was too young, too innocent and fair, to be murdered before the people on Tower Hill, as her husband had just been; so, the place of her execution was within the Tower itself. She said that she had done an unlawful act in taking what was Queen Mary's right; but that she had done so with no bad intent, and that she died a humble Christian. She begged the executioner to despatch her quickly, and she asked him, 'Will you take my head off before I lay me down?' He answered, 'No, Madam,' and then she was very quiet while they bandaged her eyes. Being blinded, and unable to see the block on which she was to lay her young head, she was seen to feel about for it with her hands, and was heard to say, confused, 'O what shall I do! Where is it?' Then they guided her to the right place, and the executioner struck off her head. You know too well, now, what dreadful deeds the executioner did in England, through many, many years, and how his axe descended on the hateful block through the necks of some of the bravest, wisest, and best in the land. But it never struck so cruel and so vile a blow as this.|$|R

40|$|Self-reconfiguring robots are {{modular robot}} {{systems that are}} {{physically}} connected and capable of making different geometric structures. Most current {{research in this field}} is focused on homogeneous systems in which all the modules are identical. In this article, we explore the concept of self-assembling robot systems consisting of passive structural modules plus active robotic modules. We study a special class of heterogeneous self-reconfiguring robots we call active linkages. The robots in this class comprise two types of modules: passive structural bars, which may either be fixed in the world or free to move individually, and mobile active 2 and 3 degrees-of-freedom (DoF) modules with rotating grippers, which may pick up or climb on the passive modules, organize and hold them in a desired shape, and actively move them for self-assembly, self-reconfiguration, or selfrepair purposes. The passive modules can be passed around by the active modules and coordinate to form the skeleton of a large class of truss and linkage geometries. Figures 1 and 2 show a simulation of a self-assembling active tower belonging to this class. So far, we have manually fabricated the passive bars or used existing structures, but we predict that the absolute simplicity in form and function of this class of passive modules will ultimately enable on-demand manufacture in situ from elements present (or intentionally placed) in the local environment of the deployed system. Figures 3 and 4 show fixed and mobile active modules, respectively. A long-term application of these systems is in-space structure construction. The modules will pack tightly in a spacecraft, yet {{they will be able to}} self-assemble, self-reconfigure, selfrepair, and adapt their collective morphology, and function, to perform a variety of tasks—some known in advance (prelaunch) and some dynamic (postlaunch). The modules can act both as effectors to assemble, repair, or service other space structures and as active orbiting structures themselves. Other applications include terrestrial construction of increasingly more capable structures such as dynamic <b>scaffolds</b> and movable <b>towers</b> for construction tasks. Challenges in building such structures span the entire spectrum from issues related to designing simple and robus...|$|R
