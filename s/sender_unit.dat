50|$|The {{fuel level}} <b>sender</b> <b>units</b> are {{physically}} different {{between the two}} models, this {{could be due to}} the differentmethods used to report the fuel level (B1-gauge, B2-LCD). The B1 model has a fuel sender with a round tank mounting, the B2 has a rectangular mounting plate, therefore the tanks are different also. The DFI fuel delivery hardware appears to be the same. The 1983 model also uses the same fuel pump and TBI setup as the B2.|$|R

40|$|Transfer and {{imitation}} of the organizational capabilities are the twin elements of competition in innovative and growing markets. Knowledge therefore becomes an important strategic asset within organizations. Consequently the management of knowledge is considered with special attention. This paper focuses on the transfer of knowledge between to units of a multinational corporation. The premise {{of this paper is}} that successful transfer of knowledge is dependent on the dimensions of the context the transfer process faces. It first gives an overview on main influence factors during the knowledge transfer process between two company units, and then investigates the question whether cultural differences in the <b>sender</b> <b>units</b> influence the knowledge transfer process.

5000|$|A {{tachograph}} system comprises a <b>sender</b> <b>unit</b> {{mounted to}} the vehicle gearbox, the tachograph head and a recording medium. Tachograph heads are of either analogue or digital types. All relevant vehicles manufactured in the EU since 1 May 2006 must be fitted with digital tachograph heads. The recording medium for analogue heads are wax coated paper discs, and for digital heads there are two recording mediums: internal memory (which can be read out with one {{of a variety of}} download devices into a so-called [...]ddd file) and digital driver cards containing a microchip with flash memory. Digital driver cards store data in a format that can later also be read out as a [...]ddd file. These files - both those read from internal memory with a download device, and those read from the driver cards - can be imported into tachograph analysis/archival software.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} how knowledge properties of a transferred manufacturing activity between units {{in an international}} manufacturing network impact performance during the transfer phase and the phase after steady state is reached. Survey data from 178 companies, we use hierarchical regression to test the relationships. We find knowledge properties as a group significantly affect both performance measures when controlling {{for the effects of}} <b>sender</b> <b>unit</b> experience, <b>sender</b> <b>unit</b> size and receiver unit experience. Thus, the activities transferred impact the success of the transfer. <b>Sender</b> <b>unit</b> experience and receiver unit experience have relatively strongest performance effects after steady state is reached. Testing the performance effects of single knowledge property dimensions, we identify independency to have the strongest relative performance effect, validates and advances previous research. This as {{it is one of the}} first survey studies to link activity independency and manufacturing transfer performance. We also identify several strands of further research...|$|E
5|$|During 1997, {{there were}} five {{incidents}} where NSB's Nordic Mobile Telephone equipment interfered with the locomotive's electronics, causing the emergency brakes to activate. This caused a temporary halt until the motorman had unlocked the brakes. The problem was fixed by moving NSB's mobile <b>senders.</b> The <b>units</b> were taken into use on the Bergen Line from 5 January 1997. Later they entered into use on the Dovre and Sørland Lines, and then on regional trains around Oslo, such as the Vestfold Line. In August 1998, NSB stated that El 18 used more power {{than some of the}} substation transformers along the line could handle, particularly along the Vestfold Line. Part of the problem was caused by a mechanism in the locomotives whereby the motor was turned off if the wheels spin. The result was that the full power output of the El 18 along parts of the railway network could not be utilized.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{steady-state}} {{performance of}} a bulk transfer TCP flow (i. e., a flow with {{a large amount of}} data to send, such as FTP transfers) may be characterized by the send rate, which is the amount of data sent by the <b>sender</b> in <b>unit</b> time. In this paper we develop a simple analytic characterization of the steady-state send rate as a function of loss rate and round trip time (RTT) for a bulk transfer TCP flow. Unlike the models in [7]–[9], and [12], our model captures not only the behavior of the fast retransmit mechanism but also the effect of the time-out mechanism. Our measurements suggest that this latter behavior is important from a modeling perspective, as almost all of our TCP traces contained more time-out events than fast retransmit events. Our measurements demonstrate that our model is able to more accurately predict TCP send rate and is accurate over a wider range of loss rates. We also present a simple extension of our model to compute the throughput of a bulk transfer TCP flow, which is defined as the amount of data received by the receiver in unit time.

40|$|The {{steady state}} {{performance}} of a bulk transfer TCP flow (i. e. a flow with {{a large amount of}} data to send, such as FTP transfers) may be characterized by three quantities. The first is the send rate, which is the amount of data sent by the <b>sender</b> in <b>unit</b> time. The second is the throughput, which is the amount of data received by the receiver in unit time. Note that the throughput will always be {{less than or equal to}} the send rate due to losses. Finally, the number of non-duplicate packets received by the receiver in unit time gives us the goodput of the connection. The goodput is always less than or equal to the throughput, since the receiver may receive two copies of the same packet due to retransmissions by the sender. In [9], we presented a simple model for predicting the steady state send rate of a bulk transfer TCP ow as a function of loss rate and round trip time. In this paper, we extend that work in two ways. First, we analyze the performance of bulk transfer TCP flows using more [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In South-East Asia, huge {{swarms of}} fireflies {{synchronously}} emit light flashes to attract mating partners. The underlying principle {{can be used}} to implement a robust and scalable distributed synchronization approach in wireless sensor networks. This paper describes the adaption of this principle for wireless sensor networks using an off the shelf IEEE 802. 15. 4 MAC layer. The method described in this paper applies the Reachback Firefly Algorithm on batterypowered low-cost wireless nodes to establish a wireless time-triggered network with a global notion of time. This global notion of time is used by the protocol but also provides a service that can be used by real-time applications. The synchronized nodes exercise a time-triggered communication, where the sending instant of each message is known a priori to all nodes. This enables the implementation of an energy-efficient low duty-cycle protocol, where <b>sender</b> and receiver <b>units</b> can be turned off during silent phases. The approach is evaluated by simulation and a real world case study using AVR®Z-Link™ 802. 15. 4 /ZigBee nodes. Results exploring various network topologies, parameter choices, and realistic clock source deviations show that this approach works in multi-hop topologies and there exists the potentiality to save more than two thirds of a node’s energy consumption. 1...|$|R
40|$|Purpose. This paper {{analyses}} and evaluates the transfer process of Codified Knowledge (CK) performed under two different approaches: the 'socio-technical' and the 'top-down'. It {{argues that the}} socio-technical approach supports the transfer of CK better than the top-down approach. Methodology. Case study methodology {{was used in the}} explanatory and qualitative study. The empirical evidence focused on the development of work standards following ISO 9000 norms at a steelworks plant. This process was examined as a process of CK transfer. Findings. First, the socio-technical approach supports the process of CK transfer better than the top-down view. Second, CK is a dynamic concept that may need varying amounts of tacit knowledge in order to enable knowledge codification and assimilation. Third, the degree of context and task similarity between <b>sender</b> and receiving <b>units</b> needs to be detailed, since small variations in organisational processes might imply significant alterations to informal work practices, a key issue that affects the CK transfer process. Research Implications. This study may, on the one hand, assist to further develop theories of knowledge transfer, such as Argote et al. 's (2003) integrative knowledge management framework. On the other hand, it complements Szulanski's (2000) research since he did not explore the approach used during the implementation process. Originality. By focusing on different approaches to transfer CK, this study has filled a research gap in the CK transfer literature. Key words: Codified knowledge, knowledge transfer, ISO 9000.
