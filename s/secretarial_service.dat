50|$|Released in May 1982, {{though with}} most of his {{employees}} still {{in prison for the}} crime Marks was found innocent of, he spent the next year running a legitimate wine importing business but he continued to spend more money than he was making and the savings he made from drug smuggling in the 1970s began to dwindle. In 1983, McCann was still at large and his smuggling enterprise was flourishing; he offered Marks the chance to sell 250 kilos of cannabis and Marks accepted. Dutch police confiscated the full shipment and arrested Mickey Williams, a member of the London underworld who had agreed to help Marks on the deal. Marks then travelled to the Far East to set up cannabis deals with Salim Malik, a Pakistani hashish exporter who he had met through Durrani (Durrani had since suffered a fatal heart attack) and Phil Sparrowhawk, an exporter from Bangkok; they would smuggle their product over to Ernie Combs in America. He also arranged a 500-kilo deal with Mickey Williams, who had travelled to Bangkok after his release from prison in Amsterdam. Marks laundered his money through various fronts: a travel agency, a paper mill, a wine importers, a bulk water transportation company and a <b>secretarial</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In October 1934, {{after nine}} months {{at his home}} in Southwold, Orwell's aunt Nellie Limouzin found him a job as a {{part-time}} assistant in Booklovers' Corner, a second-hand bookshop in Hampstead run by Francis and Myfanwy Westrope. The Westropes, who were friends of Nellie in the Esperanto movement, had an easy-going outlook and provided him with comfortable accommodation at Warwick Mansions, Pond Street. He was job sharing with Jon Kimche who also lived with the Westropes. Orwell worked at the shop in the afternoons, having the mornings free to write and the evenings to socialise. He was at Booklovers' Corner for fifteen months. His essay [...] "Bookshop Memories", published in November 1936, recalled aspects of his time at the bookshop, and in Keep the Aspidistra Flying, [...] "he described it, or revenged himself upon it, with acerbity and wit and spleen." [...] In their study of Orwell the writers Stansky & Abrahams remarked upon the improvement on the [...] "stumbling attempts at female portraiture in his first two novels: the stereotyped Elizabeth Lackersteen in Burmese Days and the hapless Dorothy in A Clergyman's Daughter" [...] and contended that, in contrast, [...] "Rosemary is a credible female portrait." [...] Through his work in the bookshop Orwell {{was in a position to}} become acquainted with women, [...] "first as a clerk, then as a friend ... and with whom, if circumstances were favourable, he might eventually embark upon a 'relationship' ... This for Orwell the author and Blair the man, was the chief reward of working at Booklovers' Corner." [...] In particular, Orwell met Sally Jerome, at this time working for an advertising agency (like Rosemary in Keep the Aspidistra Flying), and Kay Ekevall, who ran a small typing and <b>secretarial</b> <b>service</b> which did work for Adelphi magazine.|$|E

40|$|Office Services {{is a small}} {{temporary}} {{agency and}} <b>secretarial</b> <b>service</b> company founded four {{years ago by a}} mother daughter team of former temporary employees. After struggling for three years, the firm petitioned N. I. U. 's Small Business Institute for aid in increasing the company's sales. Northern responded with a student team comprised of Jeff Goldberg and Brian Helmer with Dan Lemanski, coordinator of the Small Business Institute, as the advisor. The purpose of this report is to present the major findings of the student team including the problems found, and the solutions proposed. The prime focus of this report is the personnel management of the company, rather than financial planning. During the ten week stay, the team found six main problems: organization of management, lack of direction or focus, overstated markets, incorrect pricing schedule, dropping sales levels, and recruitment of new employees. Through interviews, meetings, and outside research, possible solutions were proposed and appear in this report. If Office Services reorganizes their management hierarchy, sets goals for the company, determine a new pricing formula, and improve advertising efforts, they can capitalize on a highly profitable situation.
