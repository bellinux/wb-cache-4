40|$|This thesis {{describes}} a new accurate fault location technique for power transmission lines. The technique {{is based on}} a distributed parameter line model which inherently accounts for line conductor asymmetry and shunt capacitance. The accuracy of the new technique is not significantly affected by fault resistance, source network configuration or line length. Also, in most cases no fault type identification is required. The new fault location technique uses the current and voltage phasors at power frequency measured at the line ends. These measurements are synchronised from a knowledge of the prefault phasor data. For a <b>single-phase</b> <b>network</b> the basic idea is to equate two equations obtained for the fault point voltage; one from the sending end phasor data and the other from the receiving end phasor data. The resultant equation is solved for the distance to fault. For multiphase systems the idea is 'generalised by using the theory of natural modes which involves the evaluation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the lines. In this way a multiphase system is decoupled into a number of single-phase modal circuits; each circuit can be solved for fault location. For perfectly transposed lines the eigenvalues can simply be evaluated from the sequence components and a real eigenvector matrix can be defined for all the lines. For untransposed lines the new algorithm maintains its high accuracy when assuming perfect transposition to simplify the evaluation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Also for double-circuit applications a circuit-by-circuit fault location, without any link between the two circuits, is possible. The test results for different fault conditions presented in this thesis show the higher accuracy in fault location achieved by the new,algorithm in comparison with the algorithms used in the best commercially available fault locators...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. Now {{even more}} often in various cars and {{mechanisms}} converter-fed motors are used. Their comparative characteristics with motors which are supplied from a network of a direct current are necessary for definition of the specific moment of motors which are supplied from the single-phase alternating current main. Methodology. For the converter-fed motor with a ratio of teeth of the stator and a rotor 8 / 6 at supply from a <b>single-phase</b> <b>network</b> via the rectifier two groups of numerical experiments were carried out. Motor capacity with a constant frequency of rotation at various capacity of the capacitor at the exit of the rectifier and motor capacity at the current providing the most admissible excess of temperature of a winding are determined. Dependences of useful power on capacity size at the rectifier exit are received with a constant frequency of rotation, and also at invariable current. Results. On {{the basis of the}} made numerical experiment it is possible to conclude that due to fluctuation of tension (from 0 to 100 %) at the rectifier exit at power supply of the converter-fed motor from the single-phase alternating current main in comparison with the corresponding sizes at supply from a source of a direct current: • motor capacity at preservation of capacity of the capacitor at the exit of the rectifier and frequency of rotation decreases on 60 – 63 %; • at almost acceptable increase in capacity of the capacitor (approximately twice) power should be reduced by 50 %; • power deceleration at preservation of that size of current of the motor what took place at its food from a source of a direct current makes 40 % at preservation of size of capacity of the capacitor at the exit of the rectifier and 32 % at its doubling, the frequency of rotation decreases approximately on 13 – 15 %.

WSNs {{in which}} new nodes are periodically redeployed with certain intervals, called generations, to replace the dead nodes are called multi-phase WSNs. In the literature, there are several key predistribution schemes proposed for secure operation of WSNs. However, these schemes are designed for <b>single-phase</b> <b>networks</b> which are not resilient against continuous node capture attacks; even under temporary attacks on the network, the harm caused by the attacker does not heal in time. However, the periodic deployments in multi-phase sensor networks could be utilized to improve the resiliency of the WSNs by deploying nodes with fresh keys. In the literature, there is limited work done in this area. In this paper, we propose a key predistribution scheme for multi-phase WSNs which is resilient under node capture attacks. In our scheme, called random generation material (RGM) key predistribution scheme, each generation of deployment has its own random keying material and pairwise keys are established between node pairs of particular generations. These keys are specific to these generations. Therefore, a captured node cannot be abused to obtain keys of other generations.

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Fractal-like {{branching}} microchannel flow {{networks have}} been found to improve wall temperature uniformity and decrease both pressure drop and flow power compared to arrays of straight microchannels. The present study seeks to maximize the benefits of fractal-like branching channels by means of a gradient-based optimization algorithm. The algorithm identifies the geometric parameters that yield the highest ratio of benefit to cost; the benefit being the heat transfer with cost being flow power. The stream-wise pressure and wall temperature distributions were determined numerically using one-dimensional models validated using experimental diagnostics and computational flow analyses. Pressure distributions were used to assess flow power, and wall temperature was used as an optimization constraint. Several geometric constraints were imposed during optimization to ensure sufficient bonding area for fabrication, to maximize convective surface area and to prevent channel overlap. Three fractal-like devices were studied and optimized: a single-phase heat sink, a two-phase heat sink and a single-phase oil-to-water heat exchanger. The flow rate of the three devices was constrained using a maximum wall temperature constraint for the single-phase heat sink, the critical heat flux for the two-phase heat sink, and a fixed cold side mass flow rate and temperature rise {{in the case of the}} heat exchanger. The optimized solutions were found to depend highly on both the geometric and flow constraints imposed. As the terminal channel width was reduced, flow power was reduced in both single-phase and two-phase heat sinks. However, the flow power was increased in the heat exchanger due to the constrained volumetric flow rate. In addition, results show that if a maximum wall temperature constraint is employed, single-phase flow outperforms two-phase flow in terms of reduction in flow power.

Currently, grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems are a popular technology to convert solar energy into electricity. Existing PV panels have a relatively low and varying output voltage so that the converter installed between the PVs and the grid should be equipped with high step-up and versatile control capabilities. In addition, the output current of PV systems is rich in harmonics which affect the power quality of the grid. In this paper, a new multi-stage hysteresis control of a step-up DC–DC converter is proposed for integrating PVs into a single-phase power grid.

40|$|The {{current power}} grid {{is on the}} cusp of {{modernization}} due to the emergence of distributed generation and controllable loads, as well as renewable energy. On one hand, distributed and renewable generation is volatile and difficult to dispatch. On the other hand, controllable loads provide significant potential for compensating for the uncertainties. In a future grid where there are thousands or millions of controllable loads and {{a large portion of the}} generation comes from volatile sources like wind and solar, distributed control that shifts or reduces the power consumption of electric loads in a reliable and economic way would be highly valuable. Load control needs to be conducted with network awareness. Otherwise, voltage violations and overloading of circuit devices are likely. To model these effects, network power flows and voltages have to be considered explicitly. However, the physical laws that determine power flows and voltages are nonlinear. Furthermore, while distributed generation and controllable loads are mostly located in distribution networks that are multiphase and radial, most of the power flow studies focus on <b>single-phase</b> <b>networks.</b> This thesis focuses on distributed load control in multiphase radial distribution networks. In particular, we first study distributed load control without considering network constraints, and then consider network-aware distributed load control. Distributed implementation of load control is the main challenge if network constraints can be ignored. In this case, we first ignore the uncertainties in renewable generation and load arrivals, and propose a distributed load control algorithm, Algorithm 1, that optimally schedules the deferrable loads to shape the net electricity demand. Deferrable loads refer to loads whose total energy consumption is fixed, but energy usage can be shifted over time in response to network conditions. Algorithm 1 is a distributed gradient decent algorithm, and empirically converges to optimal deferrable load schedules within 15 iterations. We then extend Algorithm 1 to a real-time setup where deferrable loads arrive over time, and only imprecise predictions about future renewable generation and load are available at the time of decision making. The real-time algorithm Algorithm 2 is based on model-predictive control: Algorithm 2 uses updated predictions on renewable generation as the true values, and computes a pseudo load to simulate future deferrable load. The pseudo load consumes 0 power at the current time step, and its total energy consumption equals the expectation of future deferrable load total energy request. Network constraints, e. g., transformer loading constraints and voltage regulation constraints, bring significant challenge to the load control problem since power flows and voltages are governed by nonlinear physical laws. Remarkably, distribution networks are usually multiphase and radial. Two approaches are explored to overcome this challenge: one based on convex relaxation and the other that seeks a locally optimal load schedule. To explore the convex relaxation approach, a novel but equivalent power flow model, the branch flow model, is developed, and a semidefinite programming relaxation, called BFM-SDP, is obtained using the branch flow model. BFM-SDP is mathematically equivalent to a standard convex relaxation proposed in the literature, but numerically is much more stable. Empirical studies show that BFM-SDP is numerically exact for the IEEE 13 -, 34 -, 37 -, 123 -bus networks and a real-world 2065 -bus network, while the standard convex relaxation is numerically exact for only two of these networks. Theoretical guarantees on the exactness of convex relaxations are provided for two types of networks: single-phase radial alternative-current (AC) <b>networks,</b> and <b>single-phase</b> mesh direct-current (DC) networks. In particular, for <b>single-phase</b> radial AC <b>networks,</b> we prove that a second-order cone program (SOCP) relaxation is exact if voltage upper bounds are not binding; we also modify the optimal load control problem so that its SOCP relaxation is always exact. For <b>single-phase</b> mesh DC <b>networks,</b> we prove that an SOCP relaxation is exact if 1) voltage upper bounds are not binding, or 2) voltage upper bounds are uniform and power injection lower bounds are strictly negative; we also modify the optimal load control problem so that its SOCP relaxation is always exact. To seek a locally optimal load schedule, a distributed gradient-decent algorithm, Algorithm 9, is proposed. The suboptimality gap of the algorithm is rigorously characterized and close to 0 for practical networks. Furthermore, unlike the convex relaxation approach, Algorithm 9 ensures a feasible solution. The gradients used in Algorithm 9 are estimated based on a linear approximation of the power flow, which is derived with the following assumptions: 1) line losses are negligible; and 2) voltages are reasonably balanced. Both assumptions are satisfied in practical distribution networks. Empirical results show that Algorithm 9 obtains 70 + times speed up over the convex relaxation approach, at the cost of a suboptimality within numerical precision. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{introduction}} of distributed generation, DG, into low-voltage (LV) networks {{opens up the}} possibility of supplying ancillary services to aid network management and to maintain power quality. DG itself can cause voltage magnitude difficulties when injecting real power into networks with high R/X ratios, but control of reactive power injection can help overcome this. Continuous control and support only at the voltage limit conditions (to avoid unnecessary reactive power flows in normal conditions) are explored. Relatively high-impedance LV networks are prone to harmonic distortion from nonlinear loads. A variety of control methods that emphasise either harmonic-line flows or local-voltage distortion are examined, and a compromise method based on resistance emulation is shown to be effective.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{contrast}} between the very low rate of electricity access (about 6 % of households) and the significant energy resources existing in Congo justified {{an investigation into the}} obstacles to electrification and ways to overcome them. Basically electricity is generated from hydroelectric plants; the most important located in the western tip of the country (including Inga I and Inga II) and in the copper mining area in the southeast. Only the copper mining area, the area around the capital city Kinshasa and some other towns are connected to the grid or to isolated hydro plants, leaving vast parts of the country unserved. Description and analysis of existing electricity systems, their current problems and the sector master plans led to the identification of the following major obstacles to electricity expansion: [* Poor and declining performance of the electricity sector in terms of plant availability, overall losses, non-payment, and poor collection; depriving the national utility of the necessary capacity and resources to undertake electrification. * High cost of expansion programs under the approach of extending networks by transmission and three-phase distribution lines in a vast country. Limited electricity demands in most areas, lack of standardization of voltages and network equipment, and high standards of connection equipment also contributed to increase electrification costs. ] A review of literature showed that, where already applied, the recommendation of international organisations to restructure and ultimately privatise electricity utilities has yielded limited results on the particular issue of electricity expansion towards low-load areas. As electrification of such areas is a major objective in Congo, this justifies that we do not recommend this route as a key strategy in solving the electrification problem in Congo. In other words the objective of expanding electricity throughout the country {{is not likely to be}} met by private operators that prefer large-scale electricity production for urban and industrial markets and emphasize the profitability of every project. However possible ways to improve utility's performance were identified in the literature. These include: the use of prepaid meters to improve collection, transferring the management of distribution networks in some areas to local organisations, attribution of more authority to the utility to enforce non-payment and staff training under a more experienced utility in the field. The liberalization of small-scale production that allows small operators such as missionaries, NGOs, or agro-processing industries to generate and possibly distribute electricity in remote areas may also contribute to expanding electricity in the country. The literature review also revealed that alternative MV distribution technologies and connection practices tested and successfully applied in other countries for low-cost electrification were available. Despite minor inconveniences such as their capacity restriction, and the inability to provide three-phase power for motors, single-phase technologies result in cost-effective networks as far as rural electrification is concerned. This is attractive for rural electrification in Congo. Applying single-phase MV technologies with adapted SASS and PIESA guidelines and standards to the design of an isolated rural network in eastern Congo, the following results were obtained: • When loads to be served are small (about 100 - 200 kVA) phase-phase and SWER lines are cheaper to build than three-phase lines. As loads encountered in most rural areas in Congo are generally smaller than 100 kVA and can reach 100 - 200 kVA in the medium or long run, <b>single-phase</b> <b>networks</b> can adequately supply these areas from existing networks or from local plants. • The low cost of these networks in rural areas is a result of using a reduced number of components (conductors, poles, insulators and pole-top hardware), conductors of small size and of higher ratio strength to weight (T/wc), such as ACSR, that result in long spanning lengths. • If three-phase systems were systematically used, the cost of individual connection would be higher and the capacity in the networks would have been much greater than needed. Besides, given the limited financial resources other communities could not be connected owing to the high cost of three-phase lines to connect them. In addition, in order to reach the viability of the electrification project a higher tariff should be used. This is the main finding of the financial analysis carried out to investigate the viability of the electrification project in eastern Congo. As a result of high connection costs and tariffs, electricity would become unaffordable to most rural customers. This contradicts the primary objective of providing electricity to most possible customers. In practice, as shown by the case study, the pattern of electrification should be as follows. From existing networks with sufficient capacity or from a nearby plant, an optimised three-phase line towards a main center is built. Single-phase feeders of adequate rating (taking into account present demands and future growth) derive from the backbone towards various load centers. This pattern can be applied to most rural areas in Congo. At the customer level, ready boards that include isolators, protection, sockets, switches and possibly lights are installed. The cost reduction at the network and at the customer level should result in more affordable connection costs for customers. In addition to the introduction of lower cost technologies, planning approaches should be adapted. The extent to which electricity contributes to socio economic development should be the main consideration in planning electricity expansion. In other words emphasis should be put on economic and socio economic electrification. The productive uses of electricity in economic and socio economic projects bring sustainability and may attract funding for other projects from development organisations. However some social electrification to gain political support for the economic and socio economic projects are necessary. The traditional planning policy that justifies building three-phase lines as a precaution to avoid costlier upgrading at a later stage, is not adequate when financial resources and plant capacity are limited and when uncertainty exists about load growth. In other words, three-phase networks, with capacity high enough to meet years of demand that can sometimes not grow as expected, deprive other customers of connections while capacity is idle in the existing tri-phase networks. The study has shown that there is substantial scope for the application of lower cost distribution technologies than the present standards in Congo. Applying low-cost electrification technologies such as single-phase MV distribution systems to expand electricity from existing networks and from small-scale hydro plants (as a measure to postpone the construction of more costly transmission lines), after the utility has improved its performance and skills, should significantly contribute to expand electricity in Congo.

In particular, it explores the use of three-phase Power Flows and State Estimation together with VSC modeling. The VSC {{may be used to}} provide voltage regulation at selected nodes of the micro-grid in which case it acts as a STATCOM or it may be used to provide the interface between the DC PV generator and the AC side of the micro-grid. Small renewable energy plants are increasing their share of the overall energy resource. They are installed at the low-voltage end of the grid and this is blurring the otherwise classical concept of producers and consumers of electrical energy. More and more, consumers are able to produce electrical energy by installing PV cells at their premises and so they are becoming prosumers. This has resulted in the appearance of energy plants distributed all over the power grid. Hence, power flows might not be as straightforward to determine as previously, when producers and consumers were very clearly separated. In order to ensure an effective control of the operation of the grid it is of paramount importance to have an effective knowledge of the actual state of the power <b>network.</b> <b>Single-phase</b> state estimators for power grids represent a classical concept in electric power systems theory but this is limited to positive-sequence representations of the power grid, i. e., three-phase power networks which exhibit a perfect balance. Needless to say that a major limitation of the positive-sequence network representation is its inapplicability to cases when the network unbalances are significant and cannot be ignored. In real life the load is not always equally spread between the three phases; no matter how hard engineers try to achieve a reasonable balance, there is always a degree of unbalance which ought to be studied because it may impair the operation of the grid and increase its power losses. This can only be assessed by representing the three-phase power grid on its natural coordinate system, which is the abc frame-of-reference. This thesis presents a three-phase modeling approach to power flows and state estimation of balanced and unbalanced power networks. A second contribution is the modeling of a three-phase VSC that has been derived from an existing single-phase VSC. The model is then extended to incorporate the model of PV generator. Because of the flexibility with which the code has been developed, the incorporation of multiple STATCOMs and PV generators may be simulated to be a realistic part of the power grid, enabling the distributed concept and the micro-grid concept to be brought together...|$|R
