25|$|In June 1867, Wayanda {{went to the}} {{assistance}} of the ship Ellen Southard, bound from Hong Kong to California, which had run <b>short</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> after her captain died en route, leaving only his widow in charge. Wayanda took aboard 360 Chinese passengers and some of the stricken vessel's crew, transferring them to Santa Cruz on 9 June. Ellen Southard arrived safely at the same port the following day.|$|E
25|$|<b>Short</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> {{and feed}} for the horses, {{not knowing where}} his supply boats were, and {{receiving}} divided opinions from his senior officers, Banks ordered a rapid retreat downriver to Natchitoches and Grand Ecore. Both sides at the Battle of Pleasant Hill suffered roughly equal casualties of 1,600. It was a tactical victory for the Federals, but a strategic Confederate one because the Union army retreated following the battle.|$|E
25|$|Orpheus, {{under the}} command of Captain Thomas Briggs, arrived off Jamaica from England in the evening of 22 January 1807. Being <b>short</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> Briggs decided to try to sail her into Port Royal, rather than wait for a pilot. Around midnight Orpheus {{grounded}} on a reef that was not accurately marked on her charts. Efforts to lighten her failed and she took on water. When the water reached her main deck, the crew took to the boats, abandoning her.|$|E

25|$|Unfortunately for the garrison, their stone cistern had cracked, {{due to an}} earth tremor, so {{they were}} <b>short</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> and after exchanging fire with the French, they were also almost out of ammunition. After {{enduring}} a fierce bombardment, Maurice surrendered to the superior force on 3 June 1805, having resisted two French seventy-fours, a frigate, a corvette, a schooner, and eleven gunboats. The British lost two men killed and one wounded, and the French 20 dead and 40 wounded (English account), or 50 dead and wounded (French account), and three gunboats.|$|E
25|$|At 16:12 JST, Self Defence Force (SDF) Chinook {{helicopters}} {{were preparing}} to pour water on Unit 3, where white fumes rising from the building {{was believed to be}} water boiling away from the fuel rod cooling pond {{on the top floor of}} the reactor building, and on Unit 4 where the cooling pool was also <b>short</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> The mission was cancelled when helicopter measurements reported radiation levels of 50 mSv.

25|$|Beyond Weld Springs water, was {{extremely}} hard to obtain, and by 4 July the team relied on occasional thunderstorms for water. By 2 August, {{the team was}} critically short of water; a number of horses had been abandoned, and Forrest's journal indicates that the team had little confidence of survival. A few days later, it was rescued by a shower of rain.

25|$|The French in Martinique {{had been}} unable to oust the {{defenders}} from the strategically important rock, and the British garrison was able to control access to Fort-de-France Bay, firing on ships attempting to enter it with guns they had placed on the cliffs. The arrival of a large combined Franco-Spanish fleet in May changed the strategic situation. The French commander, Pierre de Villeneuve, had vague orders to attack British possessions in the Caribbean, but instead waited at Martinique for clearer instructions. He was finally persuaded to authorise an assault on the British position, and a Franco-Spanish flotilla was despatched to storm the rock. Already <b>short</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> the defenders held on in the summit for several days, while the French, who had neglected to bring scaling ladders, could make little headway.|$|E
25|$|On September 23, 1588, the San Juan de Sicilia {{was spotted}} off Islay, and {{several days later}} landed in Tobermory Bay, on the Isle of Mull. The ship was not damaged, but the crew were <b>short</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> and the ship's senior officer {{negotiated}} for supplies with the local chieftain, Lachlan MacLean of Duart. The agreement was that the ship would be replenished if Spanish troops were {{to be used to}} settle some of Duart's outstanding feuds with nearby clans. Diego Tellez Enríquez also received a surety of five hostages from Duart, and {{for more than a month}} the San Juan de Sicilia remained in port, as Spanish troops ravaged the lands of Duart's enemies. The troops aided Duart by ravaging the Inner Hebridean islands of Rum and Eigg, which belonged to MacDonald of Clanranald; and the nearby islands of Canna and Muck, which belonged to MacIan of Ardnamurchan. The troops were later used on the mainland, when they besieged Mingary Castle for three days, although MacLean of Duart was then forced to withdraw.|$|E
500|$|Crassulacean acid {{metabolism}} (CAM) is {{a mechanism}} adopted by cacti and other succulents {{to avoid the}} problems of the [...] C3 mechanism.

500|$|The leafless, spiny stem is the {{characteristic}} {{feature of the}} majority of cacti (and all of those belonging to the largest subfamily, the Cactoideae). The stem is typically succulent, meaning it is adapted to store water. The surface of the stem may be smooth (as in some species of Opuntia) or covered with protuberances of various kinds, which are usually called tubercles. These vary from small [...] "bumps" [...] to prominent, nipple-like shapes in the genus Mammillaria and outgrowths almost like leaves in Ariocarpus species. The stem may also be ribbed or fluted in shape. The prominence of these ribs depends on how much water the stem is storing: when full (up to 90% of the mass of a cactus may be water), the ribs may be almost invisible on the swollen stem, whereas when the cactus is <b>short</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and the stems shrink, the ribs may be very visible.|$|E
500|$|Cunningham was {{replaced}} by Commander George Cockburn in the command of Speedy, which remained in the Mediterranean. His first duties were limited to carrying despatches and passengers between Toulon and Genoa, after which {{he was ordered to}} join Captain Sutherland of , who was commanding a squadron blockading Genoa. The small fleet was caught in winter storms and several ships were badly damaged, forcing Sutherland and his squadron to seek shelter in nearby ports and to make repairs, with the exception of Speedy, which remained on station. Sutherland put into Hyères Bay and reported the dispersal of his squadron to Lord Hood, also noting that nothing had been heard of Speedy since the gales. Once Diadem had been repaired Sutherland returned to Genoa, and was surprised to discover Speedy still there patrolling the port, not once having left her task. While single-handedly maintaining the blockade, she had managed to capture several vessels. Sutherland ordered Speedy, which was by now running desperately <b>short</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> to Hyères to refit. At the same time, Sutherland sent a complimentary report of Cockburn to Lord Hood. On 20January1794, Cockburn was rewarded with an acting commission as post-captain of the frigate , followed a month later by a permanent command of the frigate [...]|$|E

Many men took cover in a nearby rubber plantation, the Bogyagi Rubber Estate. At 05:00, the 17th Division's headquarters came under attack at Kyaikto, but the Japanese were beaten back. A small British Indian force made up of detachments from several different units (including the Duke of Wellington's Regiment) defended the bridge, but 16th Indian Infantry Brigade and 46th Indian Infantry Brigade of the 17th Division were still further to the east, cut off.|$|E

It found plenty of good pastoral land around {{the headwaters of the}} Murchison River, but by late May, it was travelling over arid land. On 2 June, while dangerously <b>short</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> it discovered Weld Springs, [...] "one of the best springs in the colony" [...] according to Forrest.

On 10 June, two of Unicorns boats, together with two each from , [...] and , all of Sir John Borlase Warren's squadron, captured the gunboat Nochette, two other armed vessels, and eight transports carrying {{supplies for the}} fleet at Brest. Nochette was armed with two 24-pounder guns. The two other armed vessels were chasse-marée armed with eight and six guns. The transports consisted of two brigs, two sloops, and four chasse-marée, which were carrying wine, brandy, flour and peas. In addition, the crews of 20 French vessels ran their vessels ashore, where many were probably wrecked. The British suffered four men wounded, but none were from Unicorn. Unicorn was <b>short</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> so Admiral St. Vincent ordered her to escort the prizes back to Plymouth and then immediately return to her station. Unicorn arrived at Plymouth on 18 June with ten vessels, one having foundered on the way. (The crew was saved.) She sailed for Brest on 27 June. Next, Unicorn participated in the attempt on the Spanish squadron in Aix Roads on 2 July.|$|E

2500|$|Historians have characterised {{the pursuit}} as a {{failed attempt to}} capture the {{withdrawing}} Ottoman forces. That the XXI Corps advance from Gaza and the Desert Mounted Corps advance from Tel esh Sheria were to form [...] "two jaws" [...] to cut off and capture the retreating Ottoman armies. During this period, some horses only had one good drink in four days which had a serious effect on their condition. So only six of the 11 brigades of Desert Mounted Corps were available for the pursuit and having been <b>short</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> since leaving Khalasa/Asluj/Easni on 30/31 October their horses were far from fit. The unfit brigades were formed into a reserve corps and returned to areas where feed and water were available. When revived, they became available as reinforcements as the water situation north of Hareira and Sharia was sparsely populated with few very deep, low yielding water wells. Yildirim Army Group's tactics took the geographic conditions into account. They knew that if the EEF was delayed more than 48 hours without water it the pursuit would have to stop so strong rearguards were established to allow their infantry to withdraw well ahead of the slower British infantry. The EEF forces persevered {{in spite of the}} long marches on very limited forage and water, to attack the Ottoman forces relentlessly.|$|E
