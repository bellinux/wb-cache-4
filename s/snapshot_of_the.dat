5|$|Wright's {{scientific}} paintings adopted {{elements from}} {{the tradition of}} history painting but lacked the heroic central action typical of that genre. While ground-breaking, they are regarded as peculiar to Wright, whose unique style has been explained in many ways. Wright's provincial status and ties to the Lunar Society, a group of prominent industrialists, scientists and intellectuals who met regularly in Birmingham between 1765 and 1813, have been highlighted, {{as well as his}} close association with and sympathy for the advances made in the burgeoning Industrial Revolution. Other critics have emphasised a desire to capture a <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> society of the day, in the tradition of William Hogarth but with a more neutral stance that lacks the biting satire of Hogarth's work.|$|E

25|$|Both {{the current}} UK {{coalition}} {{government and the}} previous Labour Government expressed concerns about the rising costs of {{a survey of the}} whole population conducted once every ten years.

A rapidly changing society, evolving user requirements and new opportunities were emerging as drivers for change. These concerns and opportunities encouraged the UK Government to investigate alternative methods of population data collection; to identify the best way to provide small area population, and socio-demographic statistics in the future by taking advantages of the more advanced technology that is becoming available, and also to make use of existing sources of demographic data already being collected by the private sector.|$|E

When the company reported {{in the second quarter}} of 2012 that its revenues had declined along with customer growth and the amount of money existing customers spent on the site, Slate tech journalist Farhad Manjoo said Agrawal had been vindicated.

Because of the specialized and rare circumstances required for a biological structure to fossilize, only a small percentage of life-forms can be expected to be represented in discoveries, and each discovery represents only a <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> process of evolution.

500|$|Four Times of the Day was {{the first}} series of prints that Hogarth had issued since {{the success of the}} Harlot and Rake (and would be the only set he would issue until Marriage à-la-mode in 1745), so it was eagerly anticipated. On hearing of its {{imminent}} issue, George Faulkner wrote from Dublin that he would take 50 sets. The series lacks the moral lessons that are found in the earlier series and revisited in Marriage à-la-mode, and its lack of teeth meant it failed to achieve the same success, though it has found an enduring niche as a <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> society of Hogarth's time. At the auction of 1745, the paintings of Four Times of the Day raised more than those of the Rake; and Night, which is generally regarded as the worst of the series, fetched the highest single total. Cunningham commented sarcastically: [...] "Such was the reward then, to which the patrons of genius thought these works entitled". While Horace Walpole praised the accompanying print, Strolling Actresses Dressing in a Barn, as being the finest of Hogarth's works, he had little to say of Four Times of the Day other than that it did not find itself wanting in comparison with Hogarth's other works.|$|E

[...] More specifically he said, it is a play [...] "about thorny questions of identity and religion in the contemporary world, with an accent on the incendiary topic of how radical Islam and the terrorism it inspires have affected the public discourse." [...] Kapoor has [...] "rejected his Muslim upbringing (and even his surname) to better assimilate into his law firm, but he still feels the occasional tug of Islam". Geier wrote: [...] "Disgraced offers an engaging <b>snapshot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> challenge for upwardly mobile Islamic Americans in the post-9/11 age."
