30|$|<b>Savouring.</b> <b>Savouring</b> {{is a broad}} term {{related to}} a set of actions taken to generate, prolong, or intensify the {{emotional}} benefits from positive events that happen (Bryant 1989; Hurley and Kwon 2013). According to McCullough (2002), <b>savouring</b> makes episodes of appreciative functioning more likely. Methods of <b>savouring</b> include celebrating positive events and mentally replaying them later on (Quoidbach et al. 2010). Bryant and Veroff (2007) suggested that appreciative functioning can be cultivated by a <b>savouring</b> habit of ‘thanksgiving’, in which one deliberately reflects on things to be thankful for.|$|R
40|$|Traditionally, {{mental and}} {{physical}} health have been considered indicators of successful aging. However, resiliency, the propensity to bounce back from negative events, is beginning to emerge as an important aspect of aging successfully. Further, possessing emotional intelligence (EI) has been associated with improved physical and mental health. Positive emotions consistently demonstrate numerous {{mental and physical}} health benefits, however <b>savouring,</b> the process through which positive emotions are focused on, has comparatively been under-studied. The present study hypothesized that <b>savouring,</b> resiliency and EI would predict physical health in older adults, and that <b>savouring</b> would mediate the relationship between resiliency, EI, and mental health. Contrary to hypotheses, none of the variables significantly predicted physical health. In partial support of hypotheses, <b>savouring</b> mediated the relationship between resiliency and mental health, but did not mediate the relationship between EI and mental health when the two models were combined...|$|R

He was mentioned also in celebrations of Solemn Mass when the priest put incense in the thurible, reciting the prayer: Per intercessionem beati Michaelis Archangeli, stantis a dextris altaris incensi, et omnium electorum suorum, incensum istud dignetur Dominus benedicere, et in odorem suavitatis accipere.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop and {{evaluate}} an assessment that measured <b>savouring</b> leisure. The assessment items developed were reviewed for content validity by eight international therapeutic recreation (TR) educators and administrators as well as eleven TR practitioners. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted to determine the most suitable items for the assessment. The results suggest that the original three subscale design needed to be modified to five. The reliability of the total assessment is α=. 84. Statistical analysis for construct validity reveal 58. 52 % of the variance explained, and a moderate correlation was found between this study and other <b>savouring</b> assessments. The implications of the shift in conceptualization are reviewed through discussing factor analysis issues, the lived experience of <b>savouring</b> leisure, and the impact of the content validity process. This study contributes to the ongoing dialog of <b>savouring</b> leisure. Recommendations for future research are discussed...|$|R

Writing for Variety, Peter Debruge found major flaws {{with the}} film, writing, [...] "Though undeniably gorgeous, it is punishingly long, frequently boring, and woefully unengaging {{at some of}} its most critical moments. It is too subdued for Scorsese-philes, too violent for the most devout, and too abstruse for the great many moviegoers who such an expensive undertaking hopes to attract." [...] John Patterson of The Guardian stated in his review, [...] "I fear that Silence expired in the womb during that long gestation period. It is beautiful to look at, but feels inert, humourless and overly devout (to say nothing of over-long; Masahiro Shinoda's 1971 adaptation got Shūsako Endō's 1966 novel on to film using 30 fewer minutes than Scorsese).

These poems present the poet as solitary figure who was faced some unnamed transforming childhood event. Poe adopted some of the common themes of the day, including imagery of heavenly bliss and angelic beauty. He steps away from the typical use of didacticism of the time and instead focuses on psychological reverie and symbolist aesthetics, beginning his lifelong poetic refusal to write for the masses. Poe would continue to revisit themes of death, beauty, love, and pride in his later works. He would later rewrite one poem, [...] "Imitation", as [...] "A Dream Within a Dream" [...] and use images from [...] "Evening Star" [...] in [...] "Ulalume".|$|E

[...] Occasionally Wallace would choose a rumbustious comic song, some of which he also included in his LP recordings, including [...] "The One Eyed Riley", [...] "I Can't Do My Bally Bottom Button Up", [...] "Never Do It at the Station", and the sewerman's song, [...] "Down Below".|$|E

2500|$|Fronto {{never became}} Marcus' {{full-time}} teacher, and continued {{his career as}} an advocate. One notorious case brought him into conflict with Herodes. Fronto had been retained as defense counsel by Tiberius Claudius Demostratus, a prominent Athenian. Herodes Atticus was chief prosecutor. Because of Herodes' fraught relationship {{with the city of}} Athens, the defense's strategy would probably include attacks on his character. Marcus pleaded with Fronto, first with [...] "advice", then as a [...] "favor", not to attack Herodes; he had already asked Herodes to refrain from making the first blows. Fronto replied that he was surprised to discover Marcus counted Herodes as a friend (perhaps Herodes was not yet Marcus' tutor), but allowed that Marcus might be correct, and agreed that the case should not be made into a spectacle. He nonetheless affirmed his intent {{to make use of the}} material available: [...] "I warn you that I won't even use in a disproportionate way the opportunity that I have in my case, for the charges are frightful and must be spoken of as frightful.

40|$|Individual {{differences}} in the regulation of positive emotion are associated with psychological resilience and well being. This study investigated the relationship between attachment, self esteem and gender and the regulation of positive emotion. 174 participants completed an online battery measuring attachment avoidance and anxiety, global self esteem and positive emotion regulation strategies (dampening and <b>savouring).</b> Moderating moderation analyses indicated that attachment insecurity was associated with maladaptive regulation of positive emotion. <b>Savouring</b> of positive emotion was predicted by attachment avoidance but not anxiety. Dampening of positive emotion was predicted by avoidance and self esteem and by the interaction of attachment anxiety with self esteem. Correlations between attachment and specific dampening and <b>savouring</b> strategies are discussed.
