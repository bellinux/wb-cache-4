25|$|The Community Health Association of Spokane, {{a network}} of {{community}} health centers in Spokane, Washington, started a telepharmacy program in 2001. The program delivers remote medication dispensing and health counseling to patients at six urban and rural clinics; remote site personnel are connected to pharmacists at the base site by videoconferencing. A survey found that most patients at the remote sites <b>strongly</b> <b>agreed</b> or agreed {{that they would have}} had difficulty affording their medications without this program.|$|E
25|$|By the 1960s, {{scholars}} {{attempted to}} define the independent based on behavior, rather than party identification or loyalty. Focusing on ticket splitters, these studies depicted an independent voter who had {{the same level of}} political interest as strong partisans and who voted largely based on the issues with which they <b>strongly</b> <b>agreed</b> and/or disagreed. However, by focusing on voting behavior, this definition of the independent ignored non-voters. Critics claimed that the independent voter is merely a subset of the larger set of independents, which should also include non-voters. Studies also found that voting and not-voting is deeply affected by the particular candidate running in an election. Voting, therefore, is more reflective of what candidate is running—and therefore a poor measure of partisanship.|$|E

2500|$|Since its inception, {{the impact}} of the {{stimulus}} has been a subject of disagreement. Studies on its effects have produced a range of conclusions, from strongly positive to strongly negative and all reactions in between. In 2012, the IGM Forum poll conducted by the University of Chicago Booth School of Business found 80% of leading economists agree unemployment was lower at the end of 2010 {{than it would have been}} without the stimulus. Regarding whether the benefits of the stimulus outweighed its costs: 46% [...] "agreed" [...] or [...] "strongly agreed" [...] that the benefits outweighed the costs, 27% were uncertain, and 12% disagreed or strongly disagreed. IGM Forum asked the same question to leading economists in 2014. This new poll found 82% of leading economists <b>strongly</b> <b>agreed</b> or agreed that unemployment was lower in 2010 than it would have been without the stimulus. Revisiting the question about the benefits outweighing the costs, 56% <b>strongly</b> <b>agreed</b> or agreed that it did, 23% were uncertain, and 5% disagreed.|$|E
2500|$|Bowen and his {{counterpart}} at the Admiralty Signals Establishment (ASE), Canadian polymath Charles Wright, met at Bawdsey {{in the spring}} or summer of 1939 and considered {{the issue of a}} microwave airborne radar. Bowen agreed that the main problem with the range limits of the AI sets was the floodlight-like transmissions and that the easy way to fix this would be to narrow the beam, focussing the power into a smaller area. He concluded that a 10degree beamwidth would do the trick. Considering that the nose of an aircraft could hold a radar antenna about [...] across, an antenna with poles shorter than 15cm was desirable, and if that antenna had to be moved within the nose, 10cm (~3GHz) would be ideal. This <b>strongly</b> <b>agreed</b> with Wright's requirements for a shipboard system able to detect U-Boats while having an antenna small enough to be mounted on small escort vessels.|$|E
2500|$|Xi Zheng, then an {{assistant}} {{official in the}} palace library, often visited Meng Guang to consult him. When Meng Guang asked him what the crown prince, Liu Xuan, had been learning and reading {{and what he was}} interested in, Xi Zheng replied, [...] "He treats the people around him respectfully. He is very diligent and hardworking. He has the style of a crown prince of ancient times. When he meets people, he shows sincerity, kindness and generosity in everything he says and does." [...] Meng Guang then said, [...] "This is what is expected of every other person. What I really want to know is his level of political wisdom and how good his political skills are." [...] Xi Zheng replied, [...] "The Crown Prince's approach towards life is to focus on winning people's hearts and favour. He won't do what he shouldn't do. He doesn't openly reveal his wisdom. Besides, political skills can only be used under certain circumstances; they cannot be cultivated and learnt in advance." [...] Meng Guang knew that Xi Zheng was trying to careful with his words, so he said, [...] "I like to speak my mind as freely as possible. Every time I openly make criticisms, people will ridicule or hate me for that. Although I sense that you don't like to hear what I say, my words make sense. The Empire is not unified yet. Political skills are crucial in this time and age. While one's mastery of political skills depends on his intellectual abilities, political skills can be learnt and mastered through diligence. This {{has to do with the}} Crown Prince's education. He should be striving to enrich himself with as much knowledge as possible so that he can be like a consultant. He should also sit for written and oral tests like academics and gain some titles. This is a top priority for him." [...] Xi Zheng <b>strongly</b> <b>agreed</b> with him.|$|E

40|$|ObBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate perceptions regarding current practices in the care of diabetic inpatients as well as the knowledge and attitudes of nursing and medical caregivers at a large secondary hospital. DESIGN AND METHODS: Doctors and nurses taking care of diabetic inpatients were surveyed to assess their knowledge of diabetes inpatient management and their attitudes towards diabetic patients. The survey made use of the diabetes knowledge questionnaire (O'Brien) and the DAS 3 scale. RESULTS: The survey group comprised 115 health care providers, of whom 54 were doctors and 61 were nurses. The response rate was 82 %. The doctors achieved a mean score of 68. 3 % (standard deviation (SD) 11. 5 %) and the nurses 53. 9 % (SD 16. 3 %) for the diabetes knowledge questionnaire. The DAS 3 questionnaire indicated that 80. 9 % of health care personnel <b>strongly</b> <b>agree</b> that special training for managing diabetic patients is necessary, 90. 5 % <b>agree</b> or <b>strongly</b> <b>agree</b> that type 2 diabetes is a serious condition, 92. 2 % <b>agree</b> or <b>strongly</b> <b>agree</b> that tight glycaemic control is valuable, 85. 2 % <b>agree</b> or <b>strongly</b> <b>agree</b> that diabetes has a significant psychosocial impact on patients, and 88. 7 % <b>agree</b> or <b>strongly</b> <b>agree</b> that patients should have autonomy regarding their treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Health care workers (doctors and nurses) in a large secondary hospital have average to poor knowledge about the care of diabetic inpatients. The DAS 3 questionnaire, however, indicates that health care workers have a good attitude towards diabetic patients and realise that special training is necessary...|$|R
