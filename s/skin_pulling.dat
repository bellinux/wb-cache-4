50|$|Using a <b>skin</b> <b>pulling</b> {{technique}} and pulling the skin too tightly or wearing a bra {{that is too}} small in the cup size will create excessive bulges {{either side of the}} cleavage, which will look obviously pushed out of shape.|$|E
50|$|Either {{pulling the}} skin too little or showing {{too much of}} the peaks of the bulges created by a <b>skin</b> <b>pulling</b> {{technique}} may cause the curvature of the cleavage to be visibly different from the curve that would exist for real breasts of the same size. The parts of the breasts visible in the cleavage will appear to curve away in a manner that does not line up {{with the rest of the}} breasts.|$|E
50|$|Male cross-dressers often want {{to create}} the {{illusion}} of female cleavage as part of making their body appear feminine. Many crossdressers believe that displaying a convincing cleavage will distract attention from flaws in their appearance and will improve their ability to pass. Because most such males have little or no breast tissue, some form of <b>skin</b> <b>pulling</b> technique is used, often in conjunction with the use of makeup to increase the illusion.|$|E

40|$|Direction {{discrimination}} of {{a moving}} tactile stimulus requires intact dorsal columns {{and provides a}} sensitive clinical test of somatosensory dysfunction. Cortical mechanisms are poorly understood. We have applied tangential <b>skin</b> <b>pulls</b> to the right lower leg during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Healthy subjects judged {{the direction of the}} <b>skin</b> <b>pulls</b> (task experiment, n = 7) or received <b>skin</b> <b>pulls</b> passively (no task experiment, n = 8). Second somatosensory cortex (S 2) was activated in the task as well as no task experiment, and {{there was no significant difference}} in cortical activation between the two experiments. Within S 2 nearly all subjects had prominent activations in the caudal and superficial part, i. e., in the opercular parietal (OP) area 1. S 1 was activated in only one of the subjects. Thus, S 2 and especially OP 1 seems to be important for processing of lateral skin stretch stimulation. The finding suggests that a lesion of this area might cause a disturbance in tactile direction discrimination which should be relevant for clinical testing...|$|R

5000|$|Basil Johnston, an Ojibwe {{teacher and}} scholar from Ontario, gives a {{description}} of a wendigo: [...] The Wendigo was gaunt to the point of emaciation, its desiccated <b>skin</b> <b>pulled</b> tightly over its bones. With its bones pushing out against its skin, its complexion the ash gray of death, and its eyes pushed back deep into their sockets, the Wendigo looked like a gaunt skeleton recently disinterred from the grave. What lips it had were tattered and bloody .... Unclean and suffering from suppurations of the flesh, the Wendigo gave off a strange and eerie odor of decay and decomposition, of death and corruption.|$|R
25|$|Most membranophones are drums. Hornbostel-Sachs divides drums {{into three}} main types: struck drums, where {{the skin is}} hit with a stick, the hand, or {{something}} else; string drums, where a knotted string attached to the drum's <b>skin</b> is <b>pulled,</b> passing its vibrations onto the skin; and friction drums, where some sort of rubbing motion causes the skin to vibrate (a common type has a stick passing {{through a hole in}} the <b>skin</b> which is <b>pulled</b> back and forth).|$|R

50|$|The keyhole {{incision}} (think skeleton key) augments the periareolar incision {{further by}} making a vertical closure underneath (lollipop), which results after the unwanted <b>skin</b> is <b>pulled</b> in {{from side to side}} and the excess is removed.|$|R
50|$|Tissue {{expansion}} through inflation {{devices have}} gained popularity {{in recent years}} among men of the forum www.restoringforeskin.org. Inflation methods involve sealing off the area between the glans and the <b>skin</b> <b>pulled</b> over it using a clamping device (commonly baby bottle nipples are used), and either inflating the skin or a balloon placed under the skin. This causes circumferential skin stretch which is thought to stimulate mitosis. Men using this technique report fast skin regenerative growth, and in particular it {{is thought to be}} beneficial to stimulate growth of inner skin (mucous membrane) tissues which are vital to restoring the lubrication function of the foreskin.|$|R

5000|$|Shelley {{described}} Frankenstein's monster as an 8 ft, hideously ugly creation, with translucent yellowish <b>skin</b> <b>pulled</b> so taut {{over the}} body that it [...] "barely disguised {{the workings of the}} arteries and muscles underneath"; watery, glowing eyes, flowing black hair, black lips, and prominent white teeth. The monster attempts to integrate himself into human society, but is shunned by all who see him. This compels him to seek revenge against his creator. A picture of the creature appeared in the 1831 edition. Early stage portrayals dressed him in a toga, shaded, along with the monster's skin, a pale blue. Throughout the 19th century, the monster's image remained variable according to the artist.|$|R

50|$|Some {{restoration}} {{devices are}} more comfortable or more effective than others.

5000|$|The fire, {{the ball}} of fire, for example, I was in the {{basement}} when the first plane hit the building. And at that moment, I {{thought it was an}} electrical generator that blew up at that moment. A person comes running into the office saying 'explosion, explosion, explosion.' When I look at this guy; has all his <b>skin</b> <b>pulled</b> off of his body. Hanging from the top of his fingertips like it was a glove. And I said, what happened? He said the elevators. What happened was {{the ball of}} fire went down with such a force down the elevator shaft on the 58th (50A) - freight elevator, the biggest freight elevator {{that we have in the}} North Tower, it went out with such a force that it broke the cables. It went down, I think seven flights. The person survived because he was pulled from the B3 level. But this person, being in front of the doors waiting for the elevator, practically got his skin vaporized." ...|$|R

50|$|Cleavage {{enhancement}} {{encompasses a}} range of techniques used temporarily to improve {{the appearance of a}} person's breast cleavage or to create the illusion of breast cleavage on a person who has no such cleavage. This ranges from brassieres (bras) that lightly push the breasts together without any padding through {{a range of}} increasingly padded bras to techniques where chest <b>skin</b> is <b>pulled</b> towards the centre to generate cleavage and completely artificial breasts, such as breast prostheses are added to cover the materials used to <b>pull</b> the <b>skin.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fire cupping {{is where}} the air inside a cup (almost always glass) is heated then placed on the skin - the cooling air creates a {{low-pressure}} pocket the <b>pulls</b> <b>skin</b> partially into the cup.

25|$|The Rohirrim's {{capital of}} Edoras took {{six months to}} build on Mount Sunday, with {{thatched}} roofs, but that was simply the exterior: the buildings doubled as offices and lunch halls. The army created a road to the location, whilst the interior was filmed at Stone Street Studios with tapestries designed by Lee, and Théoden's wooden throne partly created by his daughter. Hill endured heavy make-up for the possession scene where his <b>skin</b> was <b>pulled</b> back and released for increased wrinkles.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis concerned {{issue of}} deer ked {{from the perspective}} of monitoring to wild game on the <b>skin</b> <b>pulled</b> from hunted animals and human specimens showing two locations for themselves binding - Mala Morava and Libava. Deer ked is hematophagous ectoparasite of cervids, which in recent years expanded its area of occurrence from Europe to America. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the prevalence and intensity of infection and to evaluate the influence of the nature habitant, weather factors or determination of sex by the host. For identification were examined 95 animals in body area, on the nape and genitals. The overall intensity of the attack were analysed in relation to age, gender, weather and landscape characteristics of point of capture. Results of occurrence of deer ked are described and evaluated demostrate the prevalence of infection almost 100 %, but the rate pressure of animals ranged from 0 to 10 deer ked 100 cm- 2. The highest occurence was found in males, and simultaneously was also associated wit a host of areas on the body where the most parasites were found on the genitals, 7 - 10 pieces. The significant influence had the temperature. The influence of rainfall was insignificant. It was found that the highest occurrence is on the animals, which use habitant fields and meadows, probably due to positive effects of solar radiation and thereby raise the surface temperature of the skin. Localization of body aeas can be used to setting means for effectiveness insecticide against these parasites...|$|R
50|$|Although {{the method}} of case {{skinning}} individual animals varies slightly, the general steps remain the same. To case skin an animal, it should be hung upside down by its feet. A cut should be made in one foot, and continued up the leg, around the anus and down the other leg. From there the <b>skin</b> can be <b>pulled</b> down the animal as though removing a sweater.|$|R
60|$|Some {{time after}} this, {{so hard and}} sharp grew the cold that Thumb and Thimble were minded to put on their red metal-hooked jackets when they went out stick-gathering. They took their knives and nut-sacks over their shoulders, and muffled and bunched {{themselves}} up close, with cotton-leaves wound round their stomachs, and their <b>skin</b> caps <b>pulled</b> low over their round frost-enticing ears. And they told Nod to cook them a smoking hot supper against the dark, for now the snow was so deep {{it was a hard}} matter to find and carry sticks, and they meant to look for more before matters worsened yet. So Nod at once set to his cookery.|$|R
50|$|If the {{connecting}} adjacent epithelial {{cells of the}} skin are not functioning correctly, layers of the <b>skin</b> can <b>pull</b> apart and allow abnormal movements of fluid within the skin, resulting in blisters and other tissue damage. Blistering diseases such as Pemphigus vulgaris and Pemphigus foliaceus are autoimmune diseases in which auto-antibodies target the proteins desmoglein 3 and desmoglein 1 respectively. The symptoms of the diseases are caused by the subsequent disruption to the desmosome-keratin filament complex leading to a breakdown in cell adhesion. Similar outbreaks occur with Hailey-Hailey disease, though the cause is not autoimmune, but, rather genetic. A haploinsufficiency of the ATP2C1 gene located on chromosome 3, which encodes the protein hSPCA1, causes malformation of the desmosomes.|$|R
