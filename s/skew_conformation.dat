40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{the application of}} molecular rotational spectroscopy to measure the conformation isomerization rate of vibrationally excited pent- 1 -en- 4 -yne (pentenyne). The rotational spectra of single quantum states of pentenyne are acquired by {{using a combination of}} IR–Fourier transform microwave double-resonance spectroscopy and high-resolution, single-photon IR spectroscopy. The quantum states probed in these experiments have energy eigenvalues of ≈ 3, 330 cm− 1 and lie above the barrier to conformational isomerization. At this energy, the presence of intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution (IVR) is indicated through the extensive local perturbations found in the high-resolution rotation–vibration spectrum of the acetylenic C–H stretch normal-mode fundamental. The fact that the IVR process produces isomerization is deduced through a qualitatively different appearance of the excited-state rotational spectra compared with the pure rotational spectra of pentenyne. The rotational spectra of the vibrationally excited molecular eigenstates display coalescence between the characteristic rotational frequencies of the stable cis and <b>skew</b> <b>conformations</b> of the molecule. This coalescence is observed for quantum states prepared from laser excitation originating in the ground vibrational state of either of the two stable conformers. Experimental isomerization rates are extracted by using a three-state Bloch model of the dynamic rotational spectra that includes the effects of chemical exchange between the stable conformations. The time scale for the conformational isomerization rate of pentenyne at total energy of 3, 330 cm− 1 is ≈ 25 ps and is 50 times slower than the microcanonical isomerization rate predicted by the statistical Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus theory...|$|R

The order {{parameters of the}} lipid chains and glycerol backbones in protein crystals are characterised by a much wider distribution of orientational order than is found in fluid lipid bilayers and reconstituted lipid-protein membranes. This indicates that the lipids that are resolved in crystals of membrane proteins are mostly not representative of the entire lipid-protein interface. Much of the chain configurational disorder of the membrane-bound lipids in crystals arises from C-C bonds in energetically disallowed <b>skew</b> <b>conformations.</b> This suggests configurational heterogeneity of the lipids at a single binding site: eclipsed conformations occur also in the glycerol backbone torsion angles and the C-C torsion angles of the lipid head groups.

Lipid head-group conformations in the protein crystals also do not conform solely to the bent-down conformation, with gauche-gauche configuration of the phosphodiester, that is characteristic of phospholipid bilayer membranes.

The phenyl groups, departing much from regular hexagonal shape, adopt highly <b>skewed</b> <b>conformations</b> with respect to the plane constituted by the four central atoms. It is thought that-the thermal motions of the phenyl rings, conditioned by the potential wells in which they are ensconced in the unit cell, are largely libratory around their normal axes.

These motions could be superimposed on torsional motions analogous to those proposed in the case of dpe. An inspection of the ORTEP diagram from the 298 K data on dphd clearly suggests these possibilities. Supportive evidence for these qualitative explanations from an analysis of the differences between the mean square displacements of C(1) and C(7) /C(1 a) and C(7 a) based on the 'rigid-body model' is discussed.

The VUV measurements are performed between 115 and 205 nm using synchrotron radiation as a tunable VUV light source. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is employed to measure absorption cross-section and band strengths in the IR region between 1. 54 and 25 μm (~ 6500 - 400 cm- 1). The measured room-temperature VUV and IR absorption cross-sections are compared with available literature data and {{are found to}} be in good agreement. The oscillator strength for the electronic transition (A 1 A'→X 1 A') around 150 - 205 nm is determined to be 0. 32 ± 0. 01. The gas temperature has a strong effect on both VUV and IR spectra. Measurements made in the VUV region show that the peak value of the band cross-section decreases and the background continuum increases with increasing gas temperature. This behavior is due to a change in the rotational and vibrational population distribution of 1 -butene molecule. Similar changes in rotational population are observed in the IR spectra.

The obtained spectra were fully assigned and revealed the {{presence in the}} matrices of three different conformers, all of them exhibiting <b>skewed</b> <b>conformations</b> around the intercarbonyl bond with the two C(4) H(3) O-C(=O) fragments nearly planar. The three conformers differ in {{the orientation of the}} furan rings relative to the carbonyl groups: the most stable conformer, I (C(2) symmetry; O=C-C=O intercarbonyl dihedral equal to 153. 1 degrees), has both furan rings orientated {{in such a way that}} one of their beta-hydrogen atoms approaches the oxygen atom of the most distant carbonyl group, forming two H-C=C-C-C=O six-membered rings; the second most stable conformer, II (C(1) symmetry; O=C-C=O intercarbonyl dihedral equal to 126. 9 degrees), has one furan ring orientated as in I, while the second furan group is rotated by ca. 180 degrees (resulting in an energetically less favourable H-C=C-C=O five-membered ring); in the third conformer, III (C(2) symmetry; O=C-C=O dihedral equal to 106. 2 degrees), both furan rings assume the latter orientation relative to the dicarbonyl group. The theoretical calculations predicted the two higher energy forms being 5. 85 and 6. 22 kJ mol(- 1) higher in energy than the most stable form, respectively, and energy barriers for conformational interconversion higher than 40 kJ mol(- 1). These barriers are high enough to prevent observation of conformational isomerization for the matrix isolated compound. The three possible conformers of alpha-furil were also found to be present in CCl(4) solution, as well as in a low temperature neat amorphous phase of the compound prepared from fast condensation of its vapour onto a suitable 10 K cooled substrate. On the other hand, in agreement with the available X-ray data [S. C. Biswas, S. Ray and A. Podder, Chem. Phys. Lett., 1987, 134, 541], the IR spectra obtained for the neat low temperature crystalline state reveals that, in this phase, alpha-furil exists uniquely in its most stable conformational state, I...|$|R

The splittings within each quartet are also halide independent ranging between 900 and 940 Hz. The high intensity quartet is assigned to the two enantiomerically related molecules. The acetone solvated structures crystallize in the triclinic space group Pi with the bromide and iodide isomorphous. Solvation changes the conformation of the PPh, ligands about Cu-P from skewed to staggered, with X-Cu-P-C(l 11) 45. 5 - 56. 3 ". The p-o tential increase in back strain because of this conformational change is relieved by an increase of 5 " in the P-Cu-P angles. The Cu-P and P-Cu-P bond lengths and angles again do not change significantly with halogen within the series. The solid-state 31 P n. m. r. spectra each reveal a single quartet shifted downfield by 6 - 1 0 p. p. m.; the quartets are slightly more asymmetric than in the trigonal phase with splitting values lying in the range 890 - 980 Hz.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{anticoagulant}} {{activation of}} the serpin antithrombin by heparin pentasaccharide DEFGH was previously shown to involve trisaccharide DEF first binding and inducing {{activation of the}} serpin, followed by disaccharide GH binding and stabilizing the activated state [Petitou et al. (1997) Glycobiology 7, 323 - 327; Desai et al. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 7478 - 7487]. In the present study, the role of conformational changes and charged residues of the GH disaccharide in the allosteric activation mechanism was investigated with variant pentasaccharides modified in the GH disaccharide. Perturbation of the conformational equilibrium of iduronate residue G through replacement of the nonessential 3 -OH of this residue with-H resulted in parallel decreases in the fraction of residue G in the skew boat conformer (from 64 to 24 %) and in the association constant for pentasaccharide binding to antithrombin [(2. 6 (0. 3) -fold], consistent with selective binding of the skew boat conformer to the serpin. Introduction of an additional sulfate group to the 3 -OH of residue H flanking a putative charge cluster in the GH disaccharide greatly enhanced the affinity for the serpin by 35 -fold with only a small increase in the fraction of residue G in the <b>skew</b> boat <b>conformation</b> (from 64 to 85 %). The salt dependence of binding, together with a recent X-ray structure of the antithrombin-pentasaccharide complex, suggested that the majorit...|$|R

The crystallographic structure of Xyn 10 A is still unknown. For this reason, we report a computer-assisted homology study conducted to build its three-dimensional structure based on the known sequence of amino acids of this enzyme. In this study, the best similarity was found with the Clostridium thermocellum (C. thermocellum) N-terminal endo- 1, 4 -β-d-xylanase 10 b. Following the 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, a reliable model was obtained for further studies.
