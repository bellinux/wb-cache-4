5|$|Around noon, as {{a result}} of poor {{coordination}} and <b>signaling,</b> <b>the</b> Swedish line unexpectedly turned toward the allied fleet. When the flagship Kronan came about in the maneuver it suddenly heeled over and began to take in water. According to master gunner Anders Gyllenspak, the sails were not reefed and the ship leaned over so hard that water flooded in through the lower gunports. As the ship was leaning over, a gust of wind pushed the ship on her side, bringing her masts and sails down in line with the surface of the sea. Shortly afterwards, the gunpowder store exploded and ripped the forward section of the starboard side apart. Kronan quickly lost buoyancy and sank, taking most of her 850-man crew with her.|$|E

5|$|The {{station was}} {{originally}} named Raastad, and opened {{as part of}} the Vestfold Line on 7December 1881. It was located in the former municipality of Sandar, that was also served by Jåstad Station. Raastad was equipped with a wooden station building designed by Balthazar Lange, and cargo expedition. There was initially only one track, but on 1July 1910, a passing loop was installed at the station, allowing trains to pass. The station was renamed Råstad in April 1921. In 1969–70 the passing loop was extended, but already on 15September 1971 it was disabled, and subsequently removed, with the automation of the <b>signaling.</b> <b>The</b> station became unmanned on 1October 1971 and was closed on 28May 1978.

The Fourth Air Fleet, under the command of Field Marshal Wolfram von Richthofen, {{was able to}} regroup and increase the number of daily sorties from an average of 350 in January to 1,000 in February, providing German forces strategic air superiority.

On 9 August she launched two kaitens against a convoy, and Hashimoto claimed a destroyer probably sunk. On 12 August he launched his remaining kaitens and claimed a merchant ship probably sunk. I-58 surfaced in Bungo Strait on 15 August, where Hashimoto learned of the Gyokuon-hōsō <b>signaling</b> <b>the</b> Japanese surrender {{and end of the}} war.

Dufieux agreed to send extra men under the command of General Quérette to Marash but by 17 January, when the reinforcements arrived, the French had already lost the initiative: supply convoys in Bel Punar and El-Oghlu had come under attack and a relief column led by battalion commander Major Corneloup had been ambushed. On 21 January, General Quérette summoned the Muslim notables of Marash to his headquarters located at a barracks in the north of the city and presented them with evidence pointing to their complicity in the attacks and demanded that they {{put an end to the}} hostilities.

5|$|Upon {{becoming}} a tropical storm, Bingiza {{was located in}} an area of weak steering currents, which resulted in a slow, meandering motion toward the southwest. Its motion turned to the south on February10, with conditions only marginally favorable for further intensification. After two days of meandering without strengthening, Bingiza turned to the southwest on due to a building ridge to its southwest toward Madagascar. Around the same time, upper-level conditions began improving, which allowed the convection to increase in coverage. Based on the improved appearance, MF upgraded Bingiza to a severe tropical storm at 0600UTC on February12 about 335km (210mi) east of the coast of Madagascar. Later that day an eye became apparent on satellite imagery, <b>signaling</b> <b>the</b> beginning of a rapid deepening trend. Late on February12, MF upgraded Bingiza to tropical cyclone intensity, which is the equivalent of a hurricane or typhoon. With minimal wind shear and warm waters, the agency forecast the cyclone to intensify further to peak 10sustained winds of 195km/h (120mph). Continuing to strengthen, Bingiza attained 10minute sustained winds of 155km/h (100mph) early on February13. Similarly, the JTWC estimated peak 1minute sustained winds of 185km/h (115mph), noting a contracting eye 37km (23mi) in diameter in the process of an eyewall replacement cycle.|$|E
