40|$|Background—Any {{reduction}} in myocardial oxygen delivery relative to its demands can impair cardiac contractile performance. Understanding the mitochondrial metabolic response to hypoxia {{is key to}} understanding ischemia tolerance in the myocardium. We employed a novel combination of two genome-scale methods to study key processes underlying human myocardial hypoxia tolerance. In particular, we hypothesised that computational modelling and evolution would identify similar genes as critical to human myocardial hypoxia tolerance. Methods and Results—We analysed a reconstruction of the cardiac mitochondrial metabolic network using constraint-based methods, under conditions of simulated hypoxia. We used flux balance analysis, random <b>sampling</b> <b>and</b> <b>principle</b> components analysis to explore feasible steady-state solutions. Hypoxia blunted maximal ATP (- 17 %) and haeme (- 75 %) synthesis and shrank the feasible solution space. TCA and urea cycle fluxes were also reduced in hypoxia, but phospholipid synthesis was increased. Using mathematical optimization methods, we identified reactions that would be critical to hypoxia tolerance in the human heart. We used data regarding SNP frequency and distribution in the genomes of Tibetans (whose ancestors have resided in persistent high-altitude hypoxia for several millennia). Six reactions were identified by both methods as being critical to mitochondrial ATP production in hypoxia: phosphofructokinase, phosphoglucokinase, Complex II, Complex IV, aconitase and fumarase. Conclusions—Mathematical optimization and evolution converged on similar genes as critical to human myocardial hypoxia tolerance. Our approach is unique and completely novel and demonstrates that genome-scale modelling and genomics {{can be used in}} tandem to provide new insights into cardiovascular genetics...|$|E

40|$|RNA {{annotation}} and {{mapping of}} promoters {{for analysis of}} gene expression (RAMPAGE) is a method that harnesses highly specific sequencing of 5 '-complete complementary DNAs to identify transcription start sites (TSSs) genome-wide. Although TSS mapping has historically relied on detection of 5 '-complete cDNAs, current genome-wide approaches typically have limited specificity and provide only scarce information regarding transcript structure. RAMPAGE allows for highly stringent selection of 5 '-complete molecules, thus allowing base-resolution TSS identification with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Paired-end sequencing of medium-length cDNAs yields transcript structure information that is essential to interpreting the relationship of TSSs to annotated genes and transcripts. As opposed to standard RNA-seq, RAMPAGE explicitly yields accurate and highly reproducible expression level estimates for individual promoters. Moreover, this approach offers a streamlined 2 -to 3 -day protocol that is optimized for extensive <b>sample</b> multiplexing, <b>and</b> is therefore adapted for large-scale projects. This method has been applied successfully to human <b>and</b> Drosophila <b>samples,</b> <b>and</b> in <b>principle</b> should be applicable to any eukaryotic system. © 2013 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|R

Since its quantitative assessment requires unbiased <b>sampling</b> <b>and</b> measurement <b>principles,</b> imaging of the whole lung with sufficient resolution for visualizing details is important. To address this request, we applied scanning laser optical tomography (SLOT) for the three dimensional imaging of mouse lung ex vivo.

Previously fixed lung lobes and whole lungs were optically cleared and subsequently imaged with SLOT while making use of intrinsic contrast mechanisms like absorption and autofluorescence. Imaging of airways, blood vessels and parenchyma is demonstrated. Volumetric SLOT datasets of the lung's internal structure can be analyzed in any preferred planar orientation. Moreover, the sample preparation preserves microscopic structure of the lung and allows for subsequent correlative histologic studies. In summary, SLOT is a useful technique to visualize and survey the internal structure of mouse lung at different scales and with various contrast mechanisms.

40|$|New {{computational}} physics methods for estimating constitutive property parameterizations in ground water aquifers were developed and demonstrated in this project. The dynamical and statistical axioms of physics, embodied in partial differential equations (PDES) of kinetic theory, are employed to constrain interpolations of hydraulic head (pressure) and transmissivity (permeability) between sparsely measured datum points. These methods can apparently {{be applied in}} numerous approaches to parameter estimation. To demonstrate the basic concepts and techniques developed in this work, examples are considered for steady-state, two-dimensional, heterogeneous, ground water flow models, given (i) discrete borehole observations of hydraulic head and transmissivity and (ii) governing kinetic equations for Darcy flow behavior. Estimations of spatially dependent parameters from sparsely measured data are treated as mathematically ill- posed problems because infinitely many parameter distributions (realizations) {{that are consistent with}} the data generally exist. Potential difficulties associated with ill-posedness in mean flow realizations are mitigated by requiring that acceptable realizations respect the observed data, are solutions of forward and inverse PDEs for physical continuity, respect information <b>sampling</b> <b>principles,</b> <b>and</b> are distributed by spatial interpolations that themselves are optimal solutions of the governing PDEs between measured datum points. To accomplish these requisites, adaptive numerical grid Galerkin techniques were applied in a novel manner-one that calibrates (constrains) the forward and inverse PDE solutions to assume the observed values of head and transmissivity at measurement locations, while also interpolating the PDE solutions between the measurement locations with basis functions, optimizations, and adaptive grids that are indigenous to Galerkin methods. Long-standing problems associated with data <b>sampling</b> <b>and</b> noise were mitigated by introducing and solving additional regularizing PDEs that, in effect, spatially filter data interpolations simultaneously with the solution of data- constrained forward and inverse flow PDES, commensurate with information <b>sampling</b> <b>and</b> signal processing <b>principles.</b> Applications of these estimation techniques to synthetic data sets with known analytic solutions demonstrate attainable accuracy levels of the techniques in challenging problems and, more importantly, provide examples of the genuine effects of data undersampling, which is always an important factor in actual practice.

40|$|A new {{approach}} combining a long pulse with the DEPTH sequence (Cory and Ritchey, Journal of Magnetic Resonance, 1988) greatly improves the efficiency for suppressing probe background signals arising from spinning modules. By applying a long initial excitation pulse in the DEPTH sequence, {{instead of a}} {pi}/ 2 pulse, the inhomogeneous B{sub 1 } fields outside the coil can dephase the background coherence in the nutation frame. The initial long pulse {{and the following two}} consecutive EXORCYCLE {pi} pulses function complementarily and prove most effective in removing background signals from both strong and weak B{sub 1 } fields. Experimentally, the length of the long pulse can be optimized around odd multiples of the {pi}/ 2 pulse, depending on the individual probe design, to preserve signals inside the coil while minimizing those from probe hardware. This method extends the applicability of the DEPTH sequence to probes with small differences in B{sub 1 } field strength between the inside and outside of the coil, and can readily combine with well-developed double resonance experiments for quantitative measurement.

Methods: The study followed purposeful <b>sampling</b> <b>and</b> saturation <b>principles</b> in which 10 female participants diagnosed as having breast cancer were interviewed. Data were analyzed following a hermeneutical process as described by Diekelmann and Ironside (Encyclopedia of Nursing Research. 1998 : 50 Y 68). Results: Seven main themes and 1 constitutive pattern emerged from the study describing the Lebanese women’s coping strategies with breast cancer. The negative stigma of cancer in the Lebanese culture, the role of women in the Lebanese families, and the embedded role of religion in Lebanese society are bases of the differences in the coping strategies of Lebanese women with breast cancer as compared to women with breast cancer from other cultures.
