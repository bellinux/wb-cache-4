500|$|Ani {{has been}} {{listed on the}} [...] by World Monuments Fund (WMF) since 1996. In May 2011 the WMF and the Turkish Ministry of Culture {{launched}} {{what they call a}} conservation project focusing on the cathedral and the nearby Church of the Redeemer. The project is funded by the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation of the U.S. State Department. Before the project a steel structure was installed around the cathedral, said to prevent its cracked sandstone walls from collapsing. The WMF and its Turkish partner, the NGO Anadolu Kültür, say they will work on [...] "stabilization and protection" [...] of the cathedral. Turkey's Minister of Culture Ertuğrul Günay stated [...] "We hope that giving new life to the remains of once-splendid buildings, such as the Ani Cathedral and church, will bring new economic opportunities to the region." [...] Armenian officials responded with skepticism. According to Gagik Gyurjyan, president of ICOMOS-Armenia, the Turkish Ministry of Culture rejected the preliminary agreement between Anadolu Kültür and the Armenian side to engage Armenian experts in restoration works. Osman Kavala, president of Anadolu Kültür, stated that the lack of formal bilateral relations between Armenia and Turkey may have prevented Armenian experts from being included in the project. Kavala stated in a 2011 interview that an estimated $1 million would be spent on the project, which was scheduled to start in 2012 and end in 4 years. Yavuz Özkaya, an architect who participated in the projects carried out in Ani, stated in March 2014 that studies on preservation and restoration of the cathedral were completed and they had begun to be implemented. These works included clearing the roofs, installing a temporary structure at the <b>separation</b> <b>point</b> between the western and southern walls, strengthening, proper completion of roof tiles and taking preventative measures.|$|E
2500|$|Both {{turbulent}} and {{laminar airflow}} contribute to swing. Air in laminar flow separates {{from the surface}} of the ball earlier than air in turbulent flow, so that the <b>separation</b> <b>point</b> moves toward the front of the ball on the laminar side. [...] On the turbulent flow side it remains towards the back, inducing a greater lift force on the turbulent airflow side of the ball. [...] The calculated net lift force is not enough to account for the amount of swing observed. Additional force is provided by the pressure-gradient force.|$|E
2500|$|Reverse swing {{occurs in}} exactly the same manner as {{conventional}} swing, despite popular misconception. Over time the rough side becomes too rough and the tears become too deep – this is why golf ball dimples are never below a certain depth, and so [...] "conventional" [...] swing weakens over time; the <b>separation</b> <b>point</b> moves {{toward the front of the}} ball on the rough side. When polishing the shiny side of the ball, numerous liquids are used, such as sweat, saliva, sunscreen, hair gel (which bowlers may apply to their hair before a game) and other illegal substances like Vaseline (applied to the clothing where the ball is polished). These liquids penetrate the porous surface of the leather ball. Over time the liquid expands and stretches the surface of the ball (which increases the surface area meaning more lift) and creates raised bumps on the polished side, due to the non-uniform nature of the expansion. The valleys between the bumps hold the air in the same manner as the tears on the rough side. This creates a layer of air over the shiny side, moving the <b>separation</b> <b>point</b> towards the back of the ball on the shiny side. The greater air coverage is now on the shiny side, giving rise to more lift and faster secondary airflow on that side. There is therefore lower static pressure on the shiny side, causing the ball to swing towards it, not away from it as in conventional swing.|$|E

2500|$|When {{the ball}} is older {{and there is an}} {{asymmetry}} in roughness the seam no longer causes the pressure difference, and can actually reduce the swing of the ball. Air turbulence is no longer used to create <b>separation</b> <b>point</b> differences and therefore the lift and pressure differences. On the rough side of the ball there are scratches and pits in the ball's surface. [...] These irregularities act {{in the same manner as}} the dimples of a golf ball: they trap the air, creating a layer of trapped air next to the rough side of the ball, which moves with the surface of the ball. The smooth side does not trap a layer of air. The next layer of air outward from the ball will have a greater velocity over the rough side, due to its contact with a layer of trapped air, rather than solid ball. This lowers the static pressure relative to the shiny side, which swings the ball. If the scratches and tears completely cover the rough side of the ball, the <b>separation</b> <b>point</b> on the rough side will move to the back of the ball, further than that of the turbulent air, thereby creating more lift and faster air flow. [...] This is why a new ball will swing more than an old ball. If the seam is used to create the turbulent air on the rough side, the tears will not fill as quickly as they would with laminar flow, dampening the lift and pressure differences.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cause for}} this [...] is the {{separation}} of the flow from the blade surfaces. This effect {{can be explained by the}} flow over an air foil. When the angle of incidence increases (during the low velocity flow) at the [...] entrance of the air foil, flow pattern changes and separation occurs. This is the first stage of stalling and through this <b>separation</b> <b>point</b> the flow separates leading to the formation of vortices, back flow in the separated region. For a further the explanation of stall and rotating stall, refer to compressor surge. The stall zone for the single axial fan and axial fans operated in parallel are shown in the figure.|$|E

40|$|In {{numerical}} ocean models coast lines {{change the}} direction from one grid cell to its neighbor {{and the value}} for viscosity is set to be as small as possible. Therefore, model simulations are not converged with resolution and boundary <b>separation</b> <b>points</b> differ in essential properties from flow separation in continuous flow fields. In this paper, we investigate {{the quality of the}} representation of boundary <b>separation</b> <b>points</b> in global ocean models. To this end, we apply well established criteria for boundary separation within an idealized ocean model setup. We investigate an eddy-resolving as well as a steady test case with idealized and unstructured coast lines in a shallow water model that is based on a finite element discretization method. The results show that well established criteria for separation fail to detect boundary <b>separation</b> <b>points</b> due to an insufficient representation of ocean flows along free-slip boundaries. Along no-slip boundaries, most separation criteria provide adequate results. However, a very sophisticated criterion based on dynamical system theory reveals that the representation of boundary separation is limited for these flows as well. We conclude that the representation of boundary <b>separation</b> <b>points</b> in numerical ocean models is not satisfying. This {{will have an impact on}} the separation of boundary currents in global ocean models...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple method}} of {{solution}} to the problem of two-dimensional separated flow around multiple-body circular cylindrical structures is presented. The method is applied to the case of two identical cylinders where the free-stream direction is perpendicular to the line joining the centers. The effect of the bodies and their wakes on the outer potential flow is modelled by surface source distributions over the front wetted surfaces. The flow in the wakes, generated by the source distributions, is ignored. The condition of the zero normal velocity is applied over the front surface to obtain an integral equation for the source strength. This equation is solved with the condition of finite velocities at the <b>separation</b> <b>points</b> to find the unknown source strength distribution and the positions of the <b>separation</b> <b>points.</b> The pressure distribution on the front wetted surface is then calculated through Bernoulli's equation. The pressure distribution on the rear surface exposed to the wake is assumed to be determined by the separation values. The effects of the distance between the bodies on the flow pattern, position of the <b>separation</b> <b>points,</b> wake under-pressure and the resultant forces are analysed. The most significant feature of the present flow model is that no empirical parameters are needed for the analysis. The empirical parameters used in other models, the back pressure coefficient and the positions of the <b>separation</b> <b>points,</b> can be predicted through the present model...|$|R

40|$|An {{inviscid}} discrete vortex model, {{with newly}} derived expressions for the tangential velocity imposed at the <b>separation</b> <b>points,</b> {{is used to}} investigate the symmetric and asymmetric vortex separation on cones and tangent ogives. The circumferential locations of separation are taken from experimental data. Based on a slender body theory, the resulting simultaneous nonlinear algebraic equations in a cross-flow plane are solved with Broyden's modified Newton-Raphson method. Total force coefficients are obtained through momentum principle with new expressions for nonconical flow. It is shown through the method of function deflation that multiple solutions exist at large enough angles of attack, even with symmetric <b>separation</b> <b>points.</b> These additional solutions are asymmetric in vortex separation and produce side force coefficients which agree well with data for cones and tangent ogives...|$|R
50|$|Boundary layer {{separation}} is the detachment of a boundary layer {{from the surface}} into a broader wake. Boundary layer separation occurs when {{the portion of the}} boundary layer closest to the wall or leading edge reverses in flow direction. The <b>separation</b> <b>point</b> is defined as the point between the forward and backward flow, where the shear stress is zero. The overall boundary layer initially thickens suddenly at the <b>separation</b> <b>point</b> and is then forced off the surface by the reversed flow at its bottom.|$|E

50|$|These bubbles can {{be reduced}} or even {{eliminated}} by shaping the airfoil to move the <b>separation</b> <b>point</b> downstream or by adding a device, a turbulator that trips the boundary layer into turbulence. The turbulent boundary layer contains more energy, so will delay separation until a greater magnitude of negative pressure gradient is reached, effectively moving the <b>separation</b> <b>point</b> further aft on the airfoil and possibly eliminating separation completely. A consequence of the turbulent boundary layer is increased skin friction relative to a laminar boundary layer, but this is very small compared {{to the increase in}} drag associated with separation.|$|E
