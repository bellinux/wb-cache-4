5|$|Passive smoking—the {{inhalation}} {{of smoke}} from another's smoking—is {{a cause of}} lung cancer in nonsmokers. A passive smoker {{can be defined as}} someone living or working with a smoker. Studies from the US, Europe and the UK have consistently shown a significantly increased risk among those exposed to passive smoke. Those who live with someone who smokes have a 20–30% increase in risk while those who work in an environment with <b>secondhand</b> <b>smoke</b> have a 16–19% increase in risk. Investigations of sidestream smoke suggest it is more dangerous than direct smoke. Passive smoking causes about 3,400 deaths from lung cancer each year in the USA.|$|E
5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} (a sudden worsening of symptoms) {{is commonly}} triggered by infection or environmental pollutants, or sometimes by other {{factors such as}} improper use of medications. Infections {{appear to be the}} cause of 50 to 75% of cases, with bacteria in 25%, viruses in 25%, and both in 25%. Environmental pollutants include both poor indoor and outdoor air quality. Exposure to personal smoke and <b>secondhand</b> <b>smoke</b> increases the risk. Cold temperature may also play a role, with exacerbations occurring more commonly in winter. Those with more severe underlying disease have more frequent exacerbations: in mild disease 1.8 per year, moderate 2 to 3 per year, and severe 3.4 per year. Those with many exacerbations have a faster rate of deterioration of their lung function. Pulmonary emboli (blood clots in the lungs) can worsen symptoms in those with pre-existing COPD. Signs of PE in COPD include pleuritic chest pain and heart failure without signs of infection.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary risk}} factor for COPD {{globally}} is tobacco smoking. Of those who smoke about 20% will get COPD, and {{of those who are}} lifelong smokers about half will get COPD. In the United States and United Kingdom, of those with COPD, 80–95% are either current smokers or previously smoked. The likelihood of developing COPD increases with the total smoke exposure. Additionally, women are more susceptible to the harmful effects of smoke than men. In non-smokers, <b>secondhand</b> <b>smoke</b> is the cause of about 20% of cases. Other types of smoke, such as, marijuana, cigar, and water pipe smoke, also confer a risk. Water pipe smoke appears to be as harmful as smoking cigarettes. Problems from marijuana smoke may only be with heavy use. Women who smoke during pregnancy may increase the risk of COPD in their child. For the same amount of cigarette smoking, women have a higher risk of COPD than men.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{estimate}} the effect of exposure to <b>secondhand</b> tobacco <b>smoke</b> on the incidence of lung adenocarcinoma in situ/minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (AIS/MIA). Data from seven case-control studies participating in the International Lung Cancer Consortium (ILCCO) were pooled, resulting in 625 cases of AIS/MIA and 7, 403 controls, of whom 170 cases and 3, 035 controls were never smokers. Unconditional logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted ORs (ORadj) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI), controlling for age, sex, race, smoking status (ever/never), and pack-years of smoking. Study center was included in the models as a random-effects intercept term. Ever versus never exposure to <b>secondhand</b> tobacco <b>smoke</b> was positively associated with AIS/MIA incidence in all subjects (ORadj = 1. 48; 95 % CI, 1. 14 - 1. 93) and in never smokers (ORadj = 1. 45; 95 % CI, 1. 00 - 2. 12). There was, however, appreciable heterogeneity of ORadj across studies (P = 0. 01), and the pooled estimates were largely influenced by one large study (40 % of all cases and 30 % of all controls). These findings provide weak evidence for an effect of <b>secondhand</b> tobacco <b>smoke</b> exposure on AIS/MIA incidence.

40|$|Background—Fine {{particulate}} matter exposure from both ambient {{air pollution and}} <b>secondhand</b> cigarette <b>smoke</b> {{has been associated with}} larger risks of cardiovascular mortality than would be expected on the basis of linear extrapolations of the relative risks from active smoking. This study directly assessed the shape of the exposure-response relationship between cardiovascular mortality and fine particulates from cigarette smoke and ambient air pollution. Methods and Results—Prospective cohort data for 1 million adults were collected by the American Cancer Society as part of the Cancer Prevention Study II in 1982. Cox proportional hazards regression models that included variables for increments of cigarette smoking and variables to control for education, marital status, body mass, alcohol consumption, occupational exposures, and diet were used to describe the mortality experience of the cohort. Adjusted relative risks of mortality were plotted against estimated average daily dose of fine {{particulate matter}} from cigarette smoke along with comparison estimates for <b>secondhand</b> cigarette <b>smoke</b> and air pollution. There were substantially increased cardiovas-cular mortality risks at very low levels of active cigarette smoking and smaller but significant excess risks even at the much lower exposure levels associated with <b>secondhand</b> cigarette <b>smoke</b> and ambient air pollution. Conclusions—Relatively low levels of fine particulate exposure from either air pollution or <b>secondhand</b> cigarette <b>smoke</b> are sufficient to induce adverse biological responses increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease mortality. The exposure-response relationship between cardiovascular disease mortality and fine particulate matter is relatively stee...|$|R
40|$|From {{the early}} 1980 s to the present, {{neoliberal}} doctrine {{has called for}} govern-ment policies of privatization, funding cutbacks, and deregulation {{of public health and}} other domestic social programs in the belief that the market rather than the public sector can best organize and distribute crucial societal services. Proponents of a neoliberal and deregulatory mixed approach of command and control and self-regulation argue this approach provides the most adequate means to conduct regulation in the legalistic and adversarial U. S. regulatory process. In April 1994, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued a proposed rule to eliminate tobacco smoking in most workplace rooms, arguing <b>secondhand</b> tobacco <b>smoke</b> annually killed up to 13, 700 nonsmokers. The tobacco industry purposely delayed public hearing procedures (later halted altogether by Congress and the president) primarily to advance unhindered private property rights and profits rather than sub-mitting to a public command-and-control regulatory framework to reduce deaths due to <b>secondhand</b> tobacco <b>smoke.</b> Since the 1930 s, when the modern American administrative state emerged and expanded with the programs of the New Deal and Great Depression, Congress has increasingly delegated policy discretion to agencies such as the Occupa-tional Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to implement public policy and legislation, such as banning <b>secondhand</b> tobacco <b>smoke</b> in workplaces through written regulations (1 – 13). (<b>Secondhand</b> tobacco <b>smoke,</b> in this article, is defined as “side stream smoke released from the smouldering cigarette or other smoking device (cigar, pipe, bidi, etc.) and diluted with ambient air ” (4).)

Method We recruited 76 non-smoking employees from venues that allowed smoking (n= 9), had mixed policies (smoking and non-smoking areas, n= 13) or were smoke-free (n= 2) between April and August 2008 in Santiago, Chile. Employees used personal air nicotine samplers during working and non-working {{hours for a}} 24 -h period to assess occupational vs. non-occupational <b>secondhand</b> tobacco <b>smoke</b> exposure and hair nicotine concentrations to assess overall <b>secondhand</b> tobacco <b>smoke</b> exposure. Results Median hair nicotine concentrations were 1. 5 ng/mg, interquartile range (IQR) 0. 7 to 5. 2 ng/mg. Time weighted average personal air nicotine concentrations were higher during working hours (median 9. 7, IQR 3. 3 – 25. 4 µg/m 3) compared to non-working hours (1. 7, 1. 0 – 3. 1 µg/m 3). Hair nicotine concentration was best predicted by personal air nicotine concentration at working hours. After adjustment, a 2 -fold increase in personal air nicotine concentration in working hours {{was associated with a}} 42 % increase in hair nicotine concentration (95 % confidence interval 14 – 70 %). Hair nicotine concentration was not associated with personal air nicotine concentration during non-working hours (non-occupational exposure). Conclusions Personal air nicotine concentration at working hours was the major determinant of hair nicotine concentrations in non-smoking employees from Santiago, Chile. <b>Secondhand</b> tobacco <b>smoke</b> exposure during working hours is a health hazard for hospitality employees working in venues where smoking is allowed.

40|$|Background: Increasing {{evidence}} has incriminated active smoking as a causal factor for tuberculosis (TB). However, {{the effect of}} <b>secondhand</b> tobacco <b>smoke</b> exposure on TB has not been similarly elucidated. Methods: A cohort of 15 486 female never-smokers aged 65 to 74 years and living with their surviving husband were enrolled at 18 Elderly Health Centers in Hong Kong from 2000 to 2003 and followed up prospectively through linkage with the territory-wide TB notification registry and death registry for TB and death until December 31, 2008, using an identity card number as a unique identifier. The relationship between passive smoking {{and the development of}} TB was assessed with adjustment for other baseline characteristics. Results: Passive exposure to <b>secondhand</b> tobacco <b>smoke</b> in the household was independently associated with obstructive lung disease (odds [OR], 1. 43; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 16 - 1. 77) and diabetes mellitus (OR, 1. 13; 95 % CI, 1. 02 - 1. 26) at baseline and with the development of both active TB (hazard ratio [HR], 1. 49; 95 % CI, 1. 01 - 2. 19) and culture-confirmed TB (HR, 1. 70; 95 % CI, 1. 04 - 2. 80) on prospective follow-up after potentially confounding background variables were controlled for. Passive smoking accounted for 13. 7 % of active TB and for 18. 5 % of culture-positive TB in this cohort. Conclusions: Similar to active smoking, passive exposure to <b>secondhand</b> tobacco <b>smoke</b> in the household also predisposes to the development of TB.
