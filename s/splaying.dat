Two sets (2004 / 2005, 2010 / 2011) of satellite images are used to visualize <b>splay</b> morphological developments and three types of crevasse <b>splays</b> are identified based on temporal changes: (1) new crevasse <b>splays</b> (NCS), refers to those <b>splays</b> that are not observed in the first set of images but can be observed on the second sets of images; (2) changing crevasse <b>splays</b> (CCS), representing those <b>splays</b> that are found on the first set of images but their geometry has changed between two satellite observation periods; and (3) inactive crevasse <b>splays</b> (ICS), referred to those <b>splays</b> that are found on the first set of images but on the second set of images they remain the same, or are partially overlapped by adjacent expanding crevasse <b>splays.</b> The density or frequency of these three types of crevasse <b>splays</b> has no correlation with the distance to the starting point of the river or the local slope.

Paleosols and nodular horizons developed during periods, or in areas, of reduced overbank flooding are used to subdivide the stratigraphy, separating crevasse <b>splay</b> sets.

25|$|Some paleontologists have {{doubted the}} biplane hypothesis, and have {{proposed}} other configurations. A 2010 study by Alexander et al. described {{the construction of}} a lightweight three-dimensional physical model used to perform glide tests. Using several hindleg configurations for the model, they found that the biplane model, while not unreasonable, was structurally deficient and needed a heavy-headed weight distribution for stable gliding, which they deemed unlikely. The study indicated that a laterally abducted hindwing structure represented the most biologically and aerodynamically consistent configuration for Microraptor. A further analysis by Brougham and Brusatte, however, concluded that Alexander's model reconstruction was not consistent with all of the available data on Microraptor and argued that the study was insufficient for determining a likely flight pattern for Microraptor. Brougham and Brusatte criticized the anatomy of the model used by Alexander and his team, noting that the hip anatomy was not consistent with other dromaeosaurs. In most dromaeosaurids, features of the hip bone prevent the legs from <b>splaying</b> horizontally; instead, they are locked in a vertical position below the body. Alexander's team used a specimen of Microraptor which was crushed flat to make their model, which Brougham and Brusatte argued did not reflect its actual anatomy. Later in 2010, Alexander's team responded to these criticisms, noting that the related dromaeosaur Hesperonychus, which is known from complete hip bones preserved in three dimensions, also shows hip sockets directed partially upward, possibly allowing the legs to splay more than in other dromaeosaurs.|$|E

40|$|In {{subduction}} zones, major thrusts called <b>splay</b> faults {{are thought}} to slip coseismically during large earthquakes affecting the main plate interface. We propose an analytical condition for the activation of a <b>splay</b> fault based on force balance calculations and suggest thrusting along the <b>splay</b> fault is generally conditioned by {{the growth of the}} accretionary wedge, or by the erosion of the hanging wall. In theory, normal slip on the <b>splay</b> fault may occur when the décollement has a very low friction coefficient seaward. Such a low friction also implies an unstable extensional state within the outer wedge. Finite element elasto-plastic calculations with a geometry based on the Nankai Kumano section were performed and confirm that this analytical condition is a valid approximation. Furthermore, localized extension at a shallow level in the <b>splay</b> hanging wall is observed in models {{for a wide range of}} friction coefficients (from ∼ 0 to the value of internal friction coefficient of the rock, here equals to 0. 4). The timing of slip established for the <b>splay</b> fault branch drilled on Nankai Kumano transect suggests a phase of concurrent <b>splay</b> and accretionary wedge growth ≈ 2 Ma to ≈ 1. 5 Ma, followed by a locking of the <b>splay</b> ≈ 1. 3 Ma. Active extension is observed in the hanging wall. This evolution can be explained by the activation of a deeper and weaker décollement, followed by an interruption of accretion. Activation of a <b>splay</b> as a normal fault, as hypothesized in the case of the Tohoku 2011 earthquake, can be achieved only if the friction coefficient on the décollement drops to near zero. We conclude that the tectonic stress state largely determines long-term variations of tightly related <b>splay</b> fault and outer décollement activity and thus influences where and how coseismic rupture ends, but that occurrence of normal slip on a <b>splay</b> fault requires coseismic friction reduction...|$|R

We used aerial photography and lithological cross-sections to reconstruct crevasse-splay formation in the largely unmanaged floodplain of the Saskatchewan River in the Cumberland Marshes (Saskatchewan, Canada). Based on surface geomorphology and subsurface deposits, various stages of crevasse-splay development were described which were linked to both external forcing and internal morphodynamics. Initial <b>splay</b> deposition, following a levee breach during a large flood, occurred as a broad but relatively thin sandy sheet in a down-basin direction in the receiving backswamp area. In a next phase, these primary crevasse-splay deposits blocked local down-basin flow, thereby forcing the crevasse-splay channel in a direction perpendicular to the parent channel and original floodbasin gradient. This created an asymmetrical <b>splay</b> sequence composition, which differs in appearance from more commonly observed dendritic crevasse <b>splays.</b> It is concluded that sedimentation patterns in the <b>splay</b> have been influenced by inherited effects of previously formed deposits.
