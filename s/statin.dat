Metabolism of <b>statins</b> varies among agents, and activity at the active site of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase is subtly different for different <b>statins.</b> Because of these chemical and pharmacological differences between <b>statins,</b> different biological effects might be anticipated.|$|R

40|$|Cardiovascular {{diseases}} {{are the leading}} cause of mortality in industrialized countries. Treatment with <b>statins</b> is effective in primary prevention in patients at high cardiovascular risk. <b>Statins</b> are inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and are classed as lipid-lowering drugs. In 2010, atorvastatin was the biggest-selling drug in the world ($US 10. 73 [*]billion). Increases in the average age of pregnant women and in the prevalence of morbid obesity have inevitably led to exposure to <b>statins</b> in certain women during the first trimester of pregnancy. The teratogenic risk attendant upon use of <b>statins</b> is unclear because the available data are contradictory, but <b>statins</b> remain contraindicated in pregnant women. The benefits of <b>statins</b> in prevention of cardiovascular risk may not be solely due to their cholesterol-lowering effects: the so-called pleiotropic effects of vascular protection lead some experts to posit a potential benefit in the management of preeclampsia. In this review we evaluate the theoretical benefits and supposed risks of <b>statins</b> in pregnant women.

40|$|<b>Statins</b> inhibit HMG-CoA reductase {{and reduce}} the {{intracellular}} formation of mevalonate. They are chemical compounds able to reduce total cholesterol by 15 - 40 % and LDL cholesterol by 20 - 60 %, and to increase HDL cholesterol by 5 - 15 %. They also reduce triglycerides by 10 - 30 %. <b>Statins,</b> blocking the mevalonate pathway, inhibit the prenylation of proteins, which is essential to perform their biological function. A great deal of research has documented {{the positive effect of}} <b>statins</b> on bone formation and the importance of bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (BMP- 2) in mediating this effect. <b>Statins</b> are also able to decrease osteoblast apoptosis. The positive effect of <b>statins</b> on bone formation is accompanied by an inhibition of osteoclast activity, which gives <b>statins</b> the ability to uncouple the bone remodeling processes. Patients taking <b>statins</b> have a higher femoral bone density than those who do not. The lipophilic <b>statins</b> seem to be more effective than the hydrophilic <b>statins</b> in protecting bone. In several clinical trials, but not in all, the use of <b>statins</b> had been associated with a reduction in the fracture risk.

25|$|The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) {{recommends}} <b>statin</b> {{treatment for}} adults {{with an estimated}} 10 year risk of developing cardiovascular disease that is greater than 10%. Guidelines by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommend <b>statin</b> treatment for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults with LDL cholesterol ≥ 190mg/dL or those with diabetes, age 40–75 with LDL-C 70–190mg/dl; or in those with a 10-year risk of developing heart attack or stroke of 7.5% or more. In this latter group, <b>statin</b> assignment was not automatic, but was recommended to occur only after a clinician-patient risk discussion with shared decision making where other risk factors and lifestyle are addressed, the potential for benefit from a <b>statin</b> is weighed against the potential for adverse effects or drug interactions and informed patient preference is elicited. Moreover, if a risk decision was uncertain, factors such as family history, coronary calcium score, ankle-brachial index, and an inflammation test (hs-CRP ≥ 2.0mg/L) were suggested to inform the risk decision. Additional factors {{that could be used}} were an LDL-C ≥ 160 or a very high lifetime risk. However, critics such as Steven E. Nissen say that the AHA/ACC guidelines were not properly validated, overestimate the risk by at least 50%, and recommend statins for patients who will not benefit, based on populations whose observed risk is lower than predicted by the guidelines. The European Society of Cardiology and the European Atherosclerosis Society recommend the use of statins for primary prevention, depending on baseline estimated cardiovascular score and LDL thresholds.|$|E

Recently, <b>statins</b> demonstrated pleiotropic cholesterol-independent effects (1). Used after stroke, <b>statins</b> proved to be neuroprotective in the setting of cerebral ischemia with improved functional outcome in patients (2).
