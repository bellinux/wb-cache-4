Marxist Friedrich Engels wrote: [...] "I have learned more [...] than from all the professional historians, economists and statisticians put together". Balzac has received high praise from critics as diverse as Walter Benjamin and Camille Paglia.

It found its final form in 1561, {{when he was working}} in the Colegio de San Gregorio. Originally planned as a six-volume work, each volume {{describes}} a decade {{of the history of the}} Indies from the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1492 to 1520, and most of it is an eye-witness account. It was in the History of the Indies that Las Casas finally regretted his advocacy for African slavery, and included a sincere apology, writing, [...] "I soon repented and judged myself guilty of ignorance. I came to realize that black slavery was as unjust as Indian slavery... and I was not <b>sure</b> <b>that</b> <b>my</b> ignorance and good faith would secure me in the eyes of God."
