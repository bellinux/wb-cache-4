5000|$|The {{process is}} multi-stepped: first, pharmaceutical-grade plastic resin is {{vertically}} heat extruded through a circular throat {{to form a}} hanging tube called the parison. This extruded tube is then enclosed within a two-part mould, and the tube is cut above the mould. The mould is transferred to the filling zone, or <b>sterile</b> <b>filling</b> space, where filling needles (mandrels) are lowered and used to inflate the plastic to form the container within the mould.

All actions take place inside a sterile shrouded chamber inside the machine. The product is then discharged to a non-sterile area for labeling, packaging and distribution.|$|E

40|$|A {{programme}} of orientated {{core drilling}} {{was carried out}} during 1989 to elucidate stratigraphic relationships within the Sterkfontein Formation and to obtain a representative suite of samples for palaeomagnetic analysis. The cores have revealed that the hominid-bearing cave deposits occur as a continuous succession comprising 6 Members and extending to a maximum depth of about 30 m below present surface. Of these Member I (comprising a <b>sterile,</b> residual <b>fill)</b> and Member 3 are the most extensive. This sequence has been displaced vertically downwards within a zone of decalcification coinciding with {{the central part of}} the deposit. This zone has been the focus of recent deep excavations at the site. The results of the drilling, in conjunction with recent surveys of the underground cave system, confirm that a dolomite floor existed at an average depth of about 20 m at the time offirst cave filling. Subsequent cavern development down to depths in excess of 50 m caused the local collapse of some lower units of the Sterkfontein Formation and, as new openings developed to the surface, permitted the ingress of younger fills below the base of the hominid-bearing succession...|$|R

This type of strict design and control is important when producing sterile medicines because consumers receiving injections, surgical irrigants, or other [...] "parenterally"-administered drugs are often highly vulnerable to infection.

The sterility of other dosage forms, such as ophthalmics, is similarly important, as blindness or partial loss of vision has occurred due to intrinsically contaminated eye medications.|$|R
50|$|Reproductive {{specialization}} generally {{involves the}} production of sterile members of the species, which carry out specialized tasks {{to care for the}} reproductive members. It can manifest in the appearance of individuals within a group whose behavior or morphology is modified for group defense, including self-sacrificing behavior ("altruism"). An example of a species whose sterile caste displays this altruistic behavior is Myrmecocystus mexicanus, one of the species of honey ant. Select <b>sterile</b> workers <b>fill</b> their abdomens with liquid food until they become immobile and hang from the ceilings of the underground nests, acting as food storage {{for the rest of the}} colony. Not all social species of insects have distinct morphological differences between castes. For example, in the Neotropical social wasp Synoeca surinama, social displays determine the caste ranks of individuals in the developing brood. These castes are sometimes further specialized in their behavior based on age. For example, Scaptotrigona postica workers assume different roles in the nest based on their age. Between approximately 0-40 days old, the workers perform tasks within the nest such as provisioning cell broods, colony cleaning, and nectar reception and dehydration. Once older than 40 days, Scaptotrigona postica workers move outside of the nest to practice colony defense and foraging.|$|R

In order to study the microbial colonization on basaltic glasses and their potential biotic/abiotic weathering products, two colonization modules called AISICS ("Autonomous in situ Instrumented Colonization System") were deployed in hydrothermal deep-sea sediments at the Guaymas Basin for 8 days and 22 days. Each AISICS module contained 18 colonizers (including <b>sterile</b> controls) <b>filled</b> with basaltic glasses of contrasting composition. Chemical analyses of ambient fluids sampled through the colonizers showed a greater contribution of hydrothermal fluids (maximum temperature 57. 6 °C) for the module deployed during the longer time period. For each colonizer, the phylogenetic diversity and metabolic function of bacterial and archaeal communities were explored using a molecular approach by cloning and sequencing. Results showed large microbial diversity in all colonizers. The bacterial distribution was primarily linked to the deployment duration, {{as well as the}} depth for the short deployment time module. Some 16 s rRNA sequences formed a new cluster of Epsilonproteobacteria. Within the Archaea the retrieved diversity could not be linked to either duration, depth or substrata. However, mcrA gene sequences belonging to the ANME- 1 mcrA-guaymas cluster were found sometimes associated with their putative sulfate-reducers syntrophs depending on the colonizers. Although no specific glass alteration texture was identified, nano-crystals of barite and pyrite were observed in close association with organic matter, suggesting a possible biological mediation.

40|$|Continuous {{extradural}} analgesia {{by means}} of repeated doses of local analgesic drugs through a catheter placed in the extradural space is now widely used in this country, both for the pro-duction of surgical analgesia and for the relief of pain. Using the caudal route, labour can be con-ducted painlessly, and by simply increasing the dosage the analgesia can be extended to cover a Caesarean section should this be necessary (Hing-son, Cull and Benzinger, 1961). Using the thoracic approach, Simpson (1961) produced a segmental extradural block which allowed patients with upper abdominal operations to have a completely pain-free post-operative course. Segmental block has been used with success {{in the treatment of}} chest injuries. Extradural analgesia will produce complete relief of pain compared with the relative analgesia of narcotic analgesics. The ability to cough without pain is of great value to the patient after operation and to the patient with a chest injury. The principal disadvantage of the method {{in the absence of a}} long-acting analgesic drug is the necessity for frequent "topping-up " doses. Many attempts have been made to simplify the tech-nique of "topping-up". Simpson and Salt designed the Oxford chuck (1961) whose inner chamber into which the extradural catheter was fed is protected by a sterile replacement cap.

40|$|Sugar {{accumulation}} in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) stems is {{a complex}} trait that is particularly plastic in response to photoperiod. This study investigated sucrose accumulation in a <b>sterile</b> (no grain <b>filling)</b> and fertile nearisogenic line of the photoperiod-sensitive cultivar IS 2848 in two greenhouse experiments. Variable phenology was induced by applying a short (12 -h PP) and a long (13 -h PP) photoperiod. Dynamics of plant growth, phenology, sugar accumulation and related enzyme activities in internodes were investigated. Under 13 -h PP, plants flowered 28 days later and attained threefold higher sucrose concentration at anthesis compared with those under 12 -h PP. Sucrose accumulation in individual internodes was driven by organ physiological age, not by plant phenology. Competition with grain filling was marginal but greater under 12 -h PP (i. e. when sucrose accumulation in internodes occurred after flowering). Enzyme activities showed marked developmental patterns but contributed little to explaining differences between treatments and genotypes. The study demonstrates that sucrose storage physiology in sweet sorghum resembles that of sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) but is more complex due to photoperiod effects on phenology. It confirms the field results on 14 sorghum genotypes contrasting for phenology and photoperiod sensitivity presented in a companion paper. Perspectives for developing sorghum ideotype concepts for food and fuel crops are discussed. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Archeological sites 41 WB 437 and 41 WB 438 are two prehistoric sites {{situated}} on opposing terraces of San Idelfonso Creek at the crossing of U. S. Highway 83, approximately 7. 5 km south of Laredo, Texas, and 0. 6 km upstream from {{the confluence of}} the stream and the Rio Grande River. Site 41 WB 438 is characterized by a relatively dense accumulation of lithic debris and occasional groundstone fragments scattered across a broad alluvial terrace {{on the south side of}} the stream. Site 41 WB 437 is characterized by a much sparser scatter of cultural material on the north terrace. Both sites, but in particular 41 WB 438, have been heavily modified at the surface by historic activity. Archeological significance testing of the portion of these two sites in the R-O-W of US Highway 83 was conducted by TxDOT personnel in late March and early April, 1997, using a combination of mechanically-excavated and hand-excavated units. The results of testing indicate that site 41 WB 437 is underlain by thick, silty late Holocene alluvial unit that contains a number of ephemeral, relatively high integrity cultural strata to depths of at least 2 m below the ground surface. While the cultural material associated with these occupations is not particularly abundant, the presence of preserved burned rock features with associated charcoal, bone, shell, and lithic debris suggests that the site has the potential to yield important subsistence and technological information relevant to discrete, short term episodes of cultural activity. Therefore, the site is considered eligible for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places and for designation as a Texas State Archeological Landmark. Because avoidance is impractical, a mechanically-assisted block excavation focused on exposure and documentation of one or more broad occupation surfaces in the upper 1. 5 m of the deposit is recommended to mitigate impacts to the site. Site 41 WB 438, in contrast, consists of a thin veneer of the same late Holocene alluvial fill resting on a much older, culturally <b>sterile</b> alluvial <b>fill.</b> Cultural material is lightly dispersed through the upper 50 cm of the terrace fill, but appears to be in poor stratigraphic context.

40|$|In the 19 th century, it {{was found}} that {{attraction}} of bees to light was controlled by light intensity irrespective of colour, and a few critical entomologists inferred that vision of bees foraging on flowers was unlike human colour vision. Therefore, quite justly, Professor Carl von Hess concluded in his book on the Comparative Physiology of Vision (1912) that bees do not distinguish colours in the way that humans enjoy. Immediately, Karl von Frisch, an assistant in the Zoology Department of the same University of Münich, set to work to show that indeed bees have colour vision like humans, thereby initiating a new research tradition, and setting off a decade of controversy that ended only at the death of Hess in 1923. Until 1939, several researchers continued the tradition of trying to untangle the mechanism of bee vision by repeatedly testing trained bees, but made little progress, partly because von Frisch and his legacy dominated the scene. The theory of trichromatic colour vision further developed after three types of receptors sensitive to green, blue, and ultraviolet (UV), were demonstrated in 1964 in the bee. Then, {{until the end of the}} century, all data was interpreted in terms of trichromatic colour space. Anomalies were nothing new, but eventually after 1996 they led to the discovery that bees have a previously unknown type of colour vision based on a monochromatic measure and distribution of blue and measures of modulation in green and blue receptor pathways. Meanwhile, in the 20 th century, search for a suitable rationalization, and explorations of <b>sterile</b> culs-de-sac had <b>filled</b> the literature of bee colour vision, but were based on the wrong theory...|$|R

Methodology: The waste water samples were aseptically collected from domestic points using 1 litre <b>sterile</b> polyethylene bottles <b>filled</b> with ice and was immediately taken to the laboratory for analysis to improve reliability of data and they were stored at 4 °C for further analysis. Results: The physicochemical analysis of wastewater collected from 20 stations were investigated. These parameters were analyzed by standard methods. The color of the collected sewage water was pale yellow to black and was turbid in some selected stations. Unpleasant odor was observed in all selected stations. The pH of the wastewater varied from 6. 0 to 7. 3, while the water conductivity ranges from 650 to 2390 μScm- 1. The maximum total suspended solid was 182 mg/l, and the maximum biological oxygen demand was 569. 5 mg/l. The chemical oxygen demand of the selected stations varied widely (507. 1 – 602. 9 mg/l), and the dissolved oxygen content varied from 0. 01 to 0. 242 mg/l. The nitrate content was found to be maximum in station G (18. 5 ppm), and the samples show high content of bacteria in all the stations. Conclusion: This study anchors on the need for effective sewage treatment of domestic, industrial and municipal effluent before they are discharged into the environment.

To date there have been no published articles that describe the heating of 2. 0 -percent CHX and its antimicrobial efficacy and clinical relevance towards E. faecalis within dentinal tubules in root canal systems. 	Ninety-five human extracted, single rooted, maxillary, anterior teeth were used to prepare dentin disk specimens. After proper sterilization, a 2. 5 -mm ISO-sized diameter lumen was prepared, and then the canals were filled with brain-heart infusion (BHI) broth infected with E. faecalis. The BHI was removed and the specimens in equally divided groups were rinsed with <b>sterile</b> saline and <b>filled</b> with saline, or 0. 12 percent CHX or 2. 0 percent CHX at ambient temperature (24 °C) or experimental temperature (46 °C) and incubated at oral temperature (37 °C) or the experimental temperature (46 °C), respectively. The specimens were frozen to - 70 ˚C and pulverized in liquid nitrogen. Serial dilutions were prepared of 1 : 100 and 1 : 1000 and spiral plated on BHI agar plates in duplicate. They were incubated, and the number of bacterial colonies was recorded 24 hours later for data analysis. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with factors for solution, solution temperature, and the solution-by-temperature interaction was used to determine antibacterial efficacy. Pair-wise comparisons between groups were examined for significance using the Fisher’s Protected Least Significant Differences Method. The E. faecalis CFU were log-transformed to satisfy the assumptions required for the ANOVA. 	The results of this investigation demonstrated no statistically significant difference with the addition of heat to either test irrigation solution regarding the elimination of E. faecalis from dentinal tubules within the root canal system. There was a statistically significant difference in the antibacterial efficacy of CHX against E. faecalis in comparison with the concentration tested. A higher concentration of 2. 0 -percent CHX demonstrated a significantly higher antibacterial efficacy against E. faecalis compared with 0. 12 -percent CHX, and likewise with the saline control. It can be concluded that the use of a higher concentration of 2. 0 -percent CHX is advantageous as a final irrigation solution after copious amounts of NaOCl and EDTA have been utilized for effective antimicrobial efficacy and substantivity...|$|R

Fieldwork {{was conducted on}} behalf of Historic Annapolis Foundation for the property's owners, King and Cornwall, Inc. Supplemental documentary research, an evaluation of existing conditions on the property, and below-ground excavation of a 35 X 70 ft. urban backlot were conducted. While the project was not a Section 106 compliance effort, the field methods and rationale for the site's investigation are {{comparable to those of}} standard Phase II site evaluations. Historical documentation attested {{to the fact that the}} 22 West Street Backlot, located along the western most edge of the Historic District of Annapolis, Maryland, had seen development and occupation since the first quarter of the eighteenth century. A substantial brick structure was known to have occupied the property in a series of altered forms for much of that period. This structure served a variety of purposes over time: a private residence in the eighteenth century, a boarding house in the nineteenth century (known as the National Hotel), a duplex in the early twentieth century, half of which remained in use until the structure was entirely razed in the 1970 s after destruction by fire. Recovery and analysis of site formation processes (i. e., both cultural and natural transformations of the buried remains) indicated that sections of the site were disturbed to a depth of six feet. In contrast to what initially seemed a poor prognosis for site integrity, other areas of the backlot revealed numerous intact historical features and deposits. Structural remains from the dwelling and its associated outbuildings, additions, and attendant trash deposits were recovered.
