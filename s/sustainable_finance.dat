40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} investment in sustainable development {{over the past}} decade, a systematic review of <b>sustainable</b> construction project <b>financing</b> is lacking. The objectives of this paper are to conduct a systematic review to examine the policies, practices, and research efforts {{in the area of}} <b>sustainable</b> construction project <b>financing,</b> and to explore the potential opportunities for the future research. To achieve these goals, this paper first reviewed the <b>sustainable</b> construction project <b>financing</b> practices implemented by four representative developed economies including the United Kingdom, the United States, Singapore, and Australia. Then, this paper reviewed the efforts and initiatives launched by three international organizations including the United Nations, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, and International Finance Corporation. After that, this paper reviewed the research efforts of <b>sustainable</b> construction project <b>financing</b> published in peer-review journals and books. This paper identified four major research themes within this area, which are the review of financial stakeholders and market of sustainable construction, benefits and barriers to <b>sustainable</b> construction project <b>financing,</b> financial vehicles for sustainable construction projects, innovative models and mechanisms for <b>sustainable</b> construction project <b>financing.</b> Additionally, this paper revealed five directions for the future research of <b>sustainable</b> construction project <b>financing,</b> which are the identification of financial issues in sustainable construction projects, the investigation of financial vehicles for sustainable construction projects in terms of their strengths, limitations, and performances, the examination of critical drivers for implementing <b>sustainable</b> construction project <b>financing,</b> the development of a knowledge-based decision support system for implementing <b>sustainable</b> construction <b>financing,</b> and the development of best practices for implementing <b>sustainable</b> construction project <b>financing.</b> This paper contributes to the body of knowledge by reviewing existing policies, practices, and research efforts in the area of <b>sustainable</b> construction project <b>financing.</b> Meanwhile, the findings from this paper benefit the industry as well, because they are able to provide the practitioners with a holistic view of <b>sustainable</b> construction project <b>financing,</b> thereby enhancing their knowledge and skills in this regard...|$|R
