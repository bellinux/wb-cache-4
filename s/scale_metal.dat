50|$|A {{more recent}} development, {{especially}} in wargaming of land battles, is 15 mm white metal miniatures, {{often referred to}} as 1:100. The use of 15 mm <b>scale</b> <b>metals</b> has grown quickly since the early 1990s as they allow a more affordable option over 28 mm if large battles are to be refought, or a large number of vehicles represented. The rapid rise in the detail and quality of castings at 15 mm scale has also helped to fuel their uptake by the wargaming community.|$|R
40|$|A {{major part}} of {{chemical}} contamination in domestic water is the release of metals from metallic water distribution systems {{and the formation of}} <b>metal</b> <b>scales.</b> The objective of this study is the assessment of well and municipality domestic water quality in houses that use metallic water distribution system in terms of total and speciated metal content and <b>metal</b> <b>scales.</b> An XRF (X-Ray fluorescence) technique was used to determine metal content used in the water distribution system of studied houses. Domestic water samples were collected from taps of 106 houses during the dry season. The following water parameters were measured: pH, alkalinity, DO (dissovled oxygen), Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Cl-, SO 4 2 -, PO 4 3 -, Fe 3 +, Zn 2 +, Cu 2 +, Pb 2 + and Cd 2 +. The corrosivity of water or scale indices were determined using the software AquaChem. The metal species and <b>metal</b> <b>scales</b> were predicted using the PHREEQC geochemical model. The results from this study revealed an inverse relation of Cl- with <b>scale</b> indices and <b>metal</b> <b>scale</b> formation except fPublishedN/...|$|R

Construction of marine vessels such as tugs, barges, trawlers and more specialised craft continued in the 1950s and 1960s, and by the 1970s the company was building vessels as long as 650 ft and as wide as 100 ft. Other postwar business lines included metal water towers, large <b>scale</b> <b>metal</b> storage tanks, bridges and structural steel for buildings, as well as specialised equipment such as metal slipways for the McNary Dam (1950s), a dry dock for the Port of Portland (1963), and the vessel RP FLIP (1962).|$|E

40|$|After {{four decades}} of {{continuous}} scaling on the CMOS technology, many innovations have been realized for improving interconnects RC performance since the emergence of copper. However, wire resistance has become a dominant factor on interconnect RC performance at the 22 nm node. Optimization of metal aspect ratio and barrier thickness are important directions for mitigating the increase of wire resistance. In addition to reducing the dielectric constant of the ULK MD, reducing the dielectric constant of the copper capping layer and the transitional layer of the ULK MD are approaches for lowering the parasitic capacitance. In order to further boost interconnect performance, an air-gap integration is an option for reducing the capacitance without <b>scaling</b> <b>metal</b> thickness. Therefore, conventional scaling can be extended to the next generation. © 2009 Materials Research Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|Juchheim's glass contact {{thermometer}} {{consisted of two}} temperature scales of equal size, constructed of frosted glass, and arranged with {{one on top of}} the other. They were connected by an electrically conductive metal filament and a sliding contact in a capillary tube. The desired temperature was set on the upper scale by sliding a movable magnet on the outside of the thermometer. Sliding the magnet simultaneously moves the tip of the lower <b>scale's</b> <b>metal</b> filament to the same value. As soon as the column of mercury reaches the selected setpoint (due to rising temperature), an electrical contact is established, thereby switching the heating device on and off at short intervals in response to changes in the temperature. This process is repeated continuously and results in a control accuracy of approximately 0.1 °C.|$|R
