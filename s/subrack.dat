40|$|The authors propose {{solutions}} for constructing mechanical structures for electronic equipment {{in terms of}} plug-in units and <b>subracks,</b> allowing to increase the layout characteristics of electronic modules, sections and desktop devices and increase their functional capacity without changing the architecture of standard mechanical structures. The paper shows effectiveness of the developed solutions. There {{is a problem of}} restraining of mass redundancy of mechanical structures for electronic equipment in relation to the weight of the electronic components. On the other hand, the weight is an indicator of structural strength, providing of which is not less important problem. These problems can be solved in different ways, the main of which are the following: a) development of new mechanical structures for electronic equipment taking into account the development of the electronic components; b) improving layout characteristics of mechanical structures for electronic equipment without significant changes in their architecture. The aim {{of the study was to}} research mechanical structures of the first level (plug-in units and modules of the second level) of <b>subracks</b> to improve layout characteristics, and to develop methods for the use of connections for surface mounting and for the use of printed circuit boards of smaller dimensions without changing the architecture of the mechanical structures in order to improve layout characteristics. The research allowed the authors to develop the following solutions: 1. The design of plug-in units in which instead of one printed circuit board (PCB) may be two, three or more PCBs of smaller dimensions to compensate a decrease in PCB fill factor in time and to increase the functional capacity of electronic modules. 2. Construction of block designs with a bilateral arrangement of plug-in units and the organization of the electrical connections by way of backplanes with electrical connectors for surface mounting, which allows performing independent installation of plug-in units on both sides of the backplane and creates conditions for increasing the number of plug-in units. The proposed solutions do not lead to a change in the architecture of standard mechanical structures for electronic equipment or any performance degradation...|$|R
40|$|Recent trends to pack {{data centers}} with more CPUs per rack {{have led to}} a {{scenario}} in which each individual rack may contain hundreds, or even thousands, of compute nodes us-ing system-on-chip (SoC) architectures. At this increased scale, traditional rack-level star topologies with a top-of-rack (ToR) switch as the hub and servers as the leaves are no longer feasible in terms of monetary cost, physical space, and oversubscription. We propose Theia, an architecture to connect hundreds of SoC nodes within a rack, using inex-pensive, low-latency, hardware elements to group the rack’s servers into subsets which we term <b>SubRacks.</b> We then re-place the traditional per-rack ToR with a low-latency, pas-sive, circuit-style patch panel that interconnects these Sub-Racks. We explore alternatives for the rack-level topology implemented by this patch panel, and we consider approaches for interconnecting racks within a data center. Finally, we in-vestigate options for routing over these new topologies.

40|$|At {{the time}} of the ICALEPCS 2007 conference, the LHC main {{accelerator}} will be close to its final state of installation, and major components will have passed the so-called “hardware commissioning. ” In this paper the requirements and the main components of the LHC control system will be described very briefly. Out of its classical 3 -tier architecture, those solutions will be presented, which correspond to major development work done here at CERN. Focus will be given to the present status of these developments and to lessons learned in the past months. THE CONTROLS INFRASTRUCTURE The LHC controls infrastructure is based on the classical 3 -tier architecture as described in fig. 1. Figure 1 : The LHC controls infrastructure. It is a new software and hardware architecture built with the many years of experience of controlling the CERN injector chain. The level of effort estimated devoted to the LHC controls amounts to 300 my and 21 MSFR over 4 years. The following paragraphs will describe each of the 3 tier of fig. 1. THE RESOURCE TIER The resource tier gathers all the controls equipment located in the field close to the accelerators. The Front-end hardware for LHC consists of a set of about 250 VMEbus 64 x <b>subracks</b> and about 120 Industrial PCs distributed in the surface buildings along the 27 km of the machine. The mission of these systems is to perform Real-time direct acquisitions and measurements close to the machine and to serve this information to the application software running in the upper levels of the control system. These embedded systems use various home-made and COTS hardware modules and serve as managers for various types of fieldbuses, such as WorldFIP, a deterministic bus used for the real-time control of the LHC power converters and Quench Protection system. This resource tier covers also Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) driving various sorts of industrials actuators and sensors for systems (e. g. LHC Cryogenics systems or the LHC vacuum system).
