40|$|We {{study the}} {{collapse}} transition of a lattice based protein model including an explicit coarse-grained {{model of a}} solvent. This model accounts for explicit hydrophobic interactions, and it is studied by Monte Carlo simulation. The protein is modelled as self-avoiding random walk with nearest neighbor interactions on a two dimensional lattice. Without the solvent, universal quantities of the chain around the collapse transition temperature are well known. Hydrophobicity is then modelled through a lattice of solvent molecules in which each molecule can have Q states depending of an orientation variable. Only one state is energetically favored, when two neighboring solvent molecules are both in the same <b>state</b> <b>of</b> <b>orientation.</b> The monomers are placed in interstitial position of the solvent lattice, and are only allowed to occupy sites surrounded by solvent cells of the same orientation. The potential of mean force between two interstitial solute molecules is calculated, showing a solvent mediated attraction typical of hydrophobic interactions. We then show that this potential increases with the energy of hydrogen bond formation as it appears in the model, while its characteristic range decreases. More importantly, we show that the chain embedded in the solvent undergoes a collapse transition, with {{the temperature of the}} transition being shifted relative to that of the chain in isolation.

40|$|Consciousness, in the {{beginning}} of its scientific use, was considered to be material, i. e., to represent an attribute of substance or matter. During later periods, it was associated with learning processes. Based on questionnaires and interviews, a number of different definitions have made its learned content dependent on statistical measures of what people consciously know. However, statically and without a proper time-scale, it is impossible to identify causal links to the biological mechanisms, responsible for consciousness. Despite the fact that no satisfactory explanation exists at the morphogenetic level, speculations continue about what consciousness actually is about. As a first measure, it has been important to establish the quality (q) function of consciousness. Empirically, it is demonstrated that the (q) function, together with the developed Agent-action-Objective (AaO) formalism has the capacity to connect spinning strings to flowing consciousness. It will also be demonstrated that a biologically important link exists between changes in the flow and the production of various shapes of consciousness.

The stiffness of a SMC panel with known <b>state</b> <b>of</b> fiber <b>orientation</b> is calculated using FEM. The influence of process induced fiber orientation is analysed. The fiber orientation for a realistic charge pattern for the panel has been obtained through mould filling simulation in a separate project. It is found that the fiber orientation has a rather small impact on the global stiffness. Only 0. 8 % lower stiffness compared to isotropic material model is obtained {{taking into account the}} fiber orientation distribution. The main reason for the low impact of the process induced fiber orientation is that the charge is symmetrically placed in the mould leading to a symmetric fiber orientation distribution.

40|$|We {{investigate}} lattices of instantons and the dimension-changing transitions between them. Our {{ultimate goal}} is the 3 D-> 4 D transition, which is holographically dual to the phase transition between the baryonic and the quarkyonic phases of cold nuclear matter. However, in this paper (just as in [1]) we focus on lower dimensions [...] the 1 D lattice of instantons in a harmonic potential V M_ 2 ^ 2 x_ 2 ^ 2 +M_ 3 ^ 2 x_ 2 ^ 2 +M_ 4 ^ 2 x_ 4 ^ 2 and the zigzag-shaped lattice as a first stage of the 1 D-> 2 D transition. We prove that in the low- and moderate-density regimes, interactions between the instantons are dominated by two-body forces. This drastically simplifies finding the ground <b>state</b> <b>of</b> the instantons' <b>orientations,</b> so we made a numeric scan <b>of</b> the whole <b>orientation</b> space instead <b>of</b> assuming any particular ansatz. We find that depending on the M_ 2 /M_ 3 /M_ 4 ratios, the ground <b>state</b> <b>of</b> instanton <b>orientations</b> can follow {{a wide variety of}} patterns. For the straight 1 D lattices, we found orientations periodically running over elements of a Z_ 2, Klein, prismatic, or dihedral subgroup of the SU(2) /Z_ 2, as well as irrational but link-periodic patterns. For the zigzag-shaped lattices, we detected 4 distinct orientation phases [...] the anti-ferromagnet, another abelian phase, and two non-abelian phases. Allowing the zigzag amplitude to vary as a function of increasing compression force, we obtained the phase diagram for the straight and zigzag-shaped lattices in the (force, M_ 3 /M_ 4), (chemical potential, M_ 3 /M_ 4), and (density, M_ 3 /M_ 4) planes.

40|$|Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are a {{class of}} newly {{developed}} and sustainable nanomaterial derived from cellulose-based materials such as wood. There have been substantial research efforts to utilize these materials as reinforcing agents. However, {{in order to develop}} CNC nanocomposites with industrial applications, it is necessary to understand how addition of CNCs affect the properties of the polymer nanocomposite. In the present work, several approaches, experimental and theoretical, are presented in an effort to characterize and understand the effect of CNCs on the properties of polymer CNC fibers. ^ Two experimental methods were used to develop cellulose acetate (CA) and CNC composite fibers: electrospinning and dry spinning. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and CNC dry spun composite fibers were also produced in order to study the effect of CNCs in additional polymeric systems. Surface morphology of these fibers was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and optical microscopy. Elastic modulus, elongation, and ultimate tensile strength were measured by dynamic mechanical analysis. CNC dispersion was assessed by optical microscopy under cross polarizers. 2 D X-ray diffraction was used along with the Herman 2 ̆ 7 s order parameter to quantify the level <b>of</b> <b>orientation</b> <b>of</b> the CNCs within the dry spun fibers. ^ It was found that the <b>orientation</b> <b>of</b> the CNCs within the fiber directly correlates to the mechanical properties of the composite. Continual improvement in the tensile strength and elastic modulus of the fibers were observed until a critical concentration. Further increases in CNC concentration did not yield corresponding improvement and led to large variations in fiber performance, likely due to increased defect density and/or aggregation of CNCs. Empirical micromechanical models Halpin-Tsai equation and an orientation modified Cox model were used to predict the fiber performance and compared with experimental results. ^ Finally, a one dimensional model is presented using fundamental equations of momentum, mass and energy, along with a modified Pipes viscous constitutive equation to predict the diameter, velocity, component concentration, and temperature profile of the dry spinning system. Sensitivity analysis was performed on various spinning parameters such as mass flow rate, temperature of the spinning dope and air, the velocity of take-up speed, and the velocity of the quenched air. In addition, the effect of CNCs 2 ̆ 7 orientation on the system was also investigated. It is found that perfectly collimated CNCs increased the elongational viscosity of the system, thus resulting in a thicker fiber. ^ The methods and results presented in this work help describe the behavior of polymer-CNC composites and may serve as a useful tool for process optimization of such materials. Based on these results, this study shows that for near collimated <b>states</b> <b>of</b> <b>orientation,</b> the CNCs provide an excellent form of polymer reinforcement and may contribute to the field as a renewable, lightweight and strong nanomaterial. ...|$|R
