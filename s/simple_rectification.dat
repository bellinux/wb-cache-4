The {{class of}} well-behaved {{evaluation}} functions simplifies and makes efficient {{the handling of}} numerical attributes; for them it suffices {{to concentrate on the}} boundary points in searching for the optimal partition.

This can be done either by identifying the main photographed object (geo-referencing of the image content) or by mapping the centre point and/or {{the outline of the}} image footprint. Whether they were acquired on the ground or from the air, digital cameras save with each photograph the exact date and time of acquisition and additionally enable to store the camera's geographical location in specific metadata fields (e. g. Exif). This location is typically obtained from GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) receivers, either operating in continuous mode to record the path of the camera platform, or the position is observed for each exposure individually. Although such positional information has huge advantages in archiving the imagery, this approach has several limits as it does not record the complete exterior orientation of the camera. More specifically, the essential roll, pitch and yaw angles of the camera are missing, thus the viewing direction and the camera rotation around it.

40|$|New {{features}} {{that may affect}} {{the behavior of the}} upper ocean in the Community Climate System Model version 3 (CCSM 3) are described. In particular, the addition of an idealized diurnal cycle of solar forcing where the daily mean solar radiation received in each daily coupling interval is distributed over 12 daylight hours is evaluated. The motivation for this simple diurnal cycle is to improve the behavior of the upper ocean, relative to the constant forcing over each day of previous CCSM versions. Both 1 - and 3 -h coupling intervals are also considered as possible alternatives that explicitly resolve the diurnal cycle of solar forcing. The most prominent and robust effects of all these diurnal cycles are found in the tropical oceans, especially in the Pacific. Here, the mean equatorial sea surface temperature (SST) is warmed by as much as 1 °C, in better agreement with observations, and the mean boundary layer depth is reduced. <b>Simple</b> <b>rectification</b> of the diurnal cycle explains about half of the shallowing, but less than 0. 1 °C of the warming.

40|$|Separation and {{purification}} are {{an integral}} part and a major cost factor in the chemical industry. Distillation is a very commonly used for solvent separation and purification process. It is neither cost effective nor process efficient when dealing with close-boiling and azeotropic solvent mixtures without modifying the relative volatility of the solvent components with an extraneous solvent or a non-volatile solute electrolyte or nonelectrolyte. The selection of a suitable modifier generally depends on the experimental determination of its effect on the Vapour–Liquid Equilibrium (VLE) of the solvent mixture. Acetic acid is most widely used as aliphatic carbonic acid. It is frequently used as a solvent like in manufacture of cellulose acetate or in manufacture of many pharmaceutical products. Aqueous acetic acid is obtained during these processes and recovery of which is of great significance. Separation of pure water from dilute solution of Acetic acid –water mixture in the concentration range of 1 % to 30 % Acetic acid by <b>simple</b> <b>rectification</b> is almost impossible as relative volatility of the mixture in this range approaches unity. We would then require towers with large number of stages which would be operated with high reflux ratio and required high energy costs and operating costs.

An alternative separation process is the addition of Lithium Bromide(LiBr) salt into acetic-acid water solution. Lithium bromide is largely soluble in water. Addition of salt will increase the boiling point of salt-water solution, there by separating comparatively pure acetic acid as overhead product. LiBr–water solution remains as residue from which LiBr can be readily separated by evaporation and reused.

40|$|Tutorialpg. 189 - 222 One of the {{foremost}} concerns facing turbomachinery users today is that of torsional vibration. In contrast to lateral vibration problems, torsional failures are especially heinous since the first symptom of a problem is often a broken shaft, gear tooth, or coupling. The difficulty of detecting incipient failures in the field makes {{the performance of a}} thorough torsional vibration analysis an essential component of the turbomachinery design process. The authors' purpose is to provide users with a practical design procedure {{that can be used to}} ensure that their systems will not encounter major difficulties in the field. It has been the authors' experience that most turbomachinery users encounter little difficulty in determining their machine's natural frequencies due to the large number of resources available in that area. However, problems often arise when they must translate this information into an accurate prediction of whether or not their design will experience torsional vibration problems. Accordingly, this presentation concentrates on the steps that should be taken once the natural frequencies have been found. A cursory review is presented of popular procedures, such as Holzer's method, for obtaining the machine's natural frequencies and mode shapes. This area is purposely limited in detail since there are many excellent resources in the literature that may be consulted for a more rigorous treatment. The generation of an interference or Campbell diagram is then treated in far more detail. Of particular interest is generation of the upward sloping lines representing the system's excitation frequencies. The various excitation sources commonly found in turbomachinery, such as gears, vaned impellers, and electric motors, are discussed along with the excitation frequencies that each introduces into the system. The unique problems associated with the startup of systems driven by synchronous motors are also described. Once the interference points have been generated, the user then generally has two choices for dealing with them. Either design changes, such as alteration of couplings, are implemented to eliminate the interferences or the interference points are subjected to further analysis. Many users automatically opt for the first alternative, since they believe they must avoid resonance conditions at all costs. While this is an admirable and worthy goal under ideal circumstances, the cost of achieving it is often unwieldy. Instead, the procedure provided herein advocates analysis of all interference points prior to the implementation of costly design changes. The analysis might be as simple as inspection of the appropriate mode shape or the unit's torque vs speed curve. Interference points can frequently be eliminated from consideration based on these inspections revealing that the induced torques are negligible. The resonant points that cannot be thereby removed should be investigated using a damped forced vibration analysis. Detailed guidelines for performing the damped analysis are presented herein. Methods for determining the magnitudes and locations of excitation torques for various machinery classes are given. Procedures are provided for obtaining damping coefficients for typical sources such as impellers, shaft material hysteresis, and couplings. Finally, users are provided with ground rules for utilizing the calculated cyclic torques and stresses to determine their design's adequacy. If the analysis identifies problem areas, practical and relatively <b>simple</b> <b>rectification</b> methods are provided. Lastly, a complete step-by-step analysis procedure is given that summarizes the entire preceding discussion. This methodology can be utilized in the design of virtually any turbomachinery system the user may encounter...|$|E

Marion, et al. reported the details of this work in 2003. One of the thirteen cases studied utilized an oxygen-fired circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boiler. In this concept, the fuel is fired with a mixture of oxygen and recirculated flue gas (mainly CO{sub 2 }). This combustion process yields a flue gas containing over 80 percent (by volume) CO{sub 2 }. This flue gas can be processed relatively easily to enrich the CO{sub 2 } content to over 96 percent for use in enhanced oil or gas recovery (EOR or EGR) or simply dried for sequestration. The Phase I study identified the O{sub 2 }-fired CFB as having a near term development potential, because it uses conventional commercial CFB technology and commercially available CO{sub 2 } capture enabling technologies such as cryogenic air separation and <b>simple</b> <b>rectification</b> or distillation gas processing systems. In the long term, air separation technology advancements offer significant reductions in power requirements, which would improve plant efficiency and economics for the oxygen-fired technology. The second phase consisted of pilot-scale testing followed by a refined performance and economic evaluation of the O{sub 2 } fired CFB concept. As a part of this workscope, ALSTOM modified its 3 MW{sub th} (9. 9 MMBtu/hr) Multiuse Test Facility (MTF) pilot plant to operate with O{sub 2 }/CO{sub 2 } mixtures of up to 70 percent O{sub 2 } by volume. Tests were conducted with coal and petroleum coke. The test objectives were to determine the impacts of oxygen firing on heat transfer, bed dynamics, potential agglomeration, and gaseous and particulate emissions. The test data results were used to refine the design, performance, costs, and economic models developed in Phase-I for the O{sub 2 }-fired CFB with CO{sub 2 } capture. Nsakala, Liljedahl, and Turek reported results from this study in 2004. ALSTOM identified several items needing further investigation in preparation for large scale demonstration of the oxygen-fired CFB concept, namely: (1) Operation and performance of the moving bed heat exchanger (MBHE) to avoid recarbonation and also for cost savings compared to the standard bubbling fluid bed heat exchanger (FBHE); (2) Performance of the back-end flash dryer absorber (FDA) for sulfur capture under high CO{sub 2 }/high moisture flue gas environment using calcined limestone in the fly ash and using fresh commercial lime directly in the FDA; (3) Determination of the effect of recarbonation on fouling in the convective pass; (4) Assessment of the impact of oxygen firing on the mercury, other trace elements, and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions; and (5) Develop a proposal-level oxygen-fired retrofit design for a relatively small existing CFB steam power plant in preparation for a large-scale demonstration of the O{sub 2 } fired CFB concept. Hence, ALSTOM responded to a DOE Solicitation to address all these issues with further O{sub 2 } fired MTF pilot testing and a subsequent retrofit design study of oxygen firing and CO{sub 2 } capture on an existing air-fired CFB plant. ALSTOM received a contract award from the DOE to conduct a project entitled 'Commercialization Development of Oxygen Fired CFB for Greenhouse Gas Control', under Cooperative Agreement DE-FC 26 - 04 NT 42205 {{that is the subject of}} this topical report...|$|E
