2500|$|The park {{is home to}} {{significant}} populations of primates in Vietnam, with ten species and sub-species. These include the globally vulnerable pig-tailed macaque, Assam macaque, stump-tailed macaque and white-cheeked crested gibbon (Nomascus leucogenys and Nomascus leucogenys siki). The park is probably home to the largest population of Fran√ßois' langur in Vietnam, including two different forms of the species. The area is highly significant for its population of Hatinh langur and black langur. It is undoubtedly the largest population of these species in the world, and probably the only population represented in a protected area. Other endangered large mammals include the mainland serow (Capricornis sumatraensis), giant muntjac (Megamuntiacus vuquangensis) and possibly the <b>saola</b> (Pseudoryx nghetinhensis). The Asian black bear (Selenarctos thibetanus) and sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) are confirmed. Other smaller mammals include Sunda pangolins (Manis javanica) and the recently discovered striped hare, called locally [...] "tho van" [...] (Nesolagus timminsii). Ten bat species listed in the IUCN List of Threatened Species have been recorded in this park.|$|E

50|$|Early on July 28, the JTWC {{upgraded}} {{the system}} to a tropical depression, whilst the JMA upgraded it to a tropical storm and named it <b>Saola.</b> Soon, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) upgraded {{the system to}} a tropical depression and named it Gener. Later that day, the JTWC upgraded <b>Saola</b> to a tropical storm. Early on July 29, the JMA upgraded <b>Saola</b> to a severe tropical storm. On July 30, the JTWC upgraded <b>Saola</b> to a category 1 typhoon, as it started to develop an eye-like feature, but soon downgraded it to a tropical storm late on the same day. On July 31, the JTWC upgraded <b>Saola</b> to a category 1 typhoon again. Late on the same day, the JMA upgraded <b>Saola</b> to a typhoon, and the JTWC soon upgraded it to a category 2 typhoon early on the next day. The Central Weather Bureau (CWB) reported that Typhoon <b>Saola</b> made landfall over Xiulin, Hualien in Taiwan at 19:20 UTC on August 1 (03:20 TST on August 2). However, <b>Saola</b> later moved counterclockwise and arrived the ocean soon, whilst the JMA downgraded it to a severe tropical storm early on August 2 due to strong land interaction. At 06Z on the same day, <b>Saola</b> passed over Cape San Diego, the easternmost point of Taiwan. Late on August 2, the JMA downgraded <b>Saola</b> to a tropical storm, before it made landfall over Fuding in Fujian, China at 22:50 UTC (06:50 CST on August 3). On August 3, the JMA downgraded <b>Saola</b> to a tropical depression, after the JTWC issued a final warning on the system. The system continued to weaken into a weak low pressure area over Jiangxi, China on August 4. The weak, remnant low later drifted south west to the Gulf of Tokin, and regenerated slightly on August 7.|$|E

50|$|According to {{biodiversity}} specialist Tony Whitten, though Vietnam {{boasts a}} variety of flora and fauna, {{many of which have}} been recently described, the discovery of a large animal as the <b>saola</b> was quite unexpected. The <b>saola</b> was the first large mammal to be discovered in the area for 50 years. Observations of live <b>saola</b> have been few and far between, restricted to the Annamite Range.|$|E
50|$|Most {{forecast}} models predicts <b>Saola</b> to pass {{very near}} {{on the northern}} coastline of Taiwan, but this is defied on August 1, when <b>Saola</b> had made landfall on Taiwan as a Category 2 typhoon. It moved slowly inland, making a counter-clockwise loop. It made out to sea, now downgraded as a severe tropical storm. Just then did <b>Saola</b> passed {{very close to the}} northern coastline of Taiwan, then it headed straight for China. On August 3 it made landfall near Fuding, Fujian Province as a tropical storm, then headed straight inland until on the next day when <b>Saola</b> dissipated near Jiangxi.|$|E

50|$|Species of {{conservation}} concern are frequently hard to study; {{there are often}} delays in implementing or identifying necessary conservation needs {{due to lack of}} data. Because the species is so rare, there is a continuous lack of adequate data; {{this is one of the}} major problems facing <b>saola</b> conservation. Trained scientists have never observed <b>saola</b> in the wild. Unfortunately, because it is unlikely that intact <b>saola</b> populations exist, field surveys to discover these populations are not a conservation priority.|$|E
50|$|The {{key feature}} of the area {{occupied}} by the <b>saola</b> is its remoteness from human disturbance. <b>Saola</b> are shot for their meat, but hunters also gain high esteem in the village {{for the production of}} a carcass. Due to the scarcity, the locals place much more value on the <b>saola</b> than more common species. Because the people in this area are traditional hunters, their attitude about killing the <b>saola</b> is hard to change; this makes conservation difficult. The intense interest from the scientific community has actually motivated hunters to capture live specimens. Commercial logging has been stopped in the nature reserve area of Bu Huong, and there is an official ban on forest clearance within the boundaries of the reserve.|$|E
50|$|The <b>saola</b> is {{currently}} {{considered to be}} critically endangered. Its restrictive habitat requirements and aversion to human proximity are likely to endanger it through habitat loss and habitat fragmentation. <b>Saola</b> suffer losses through hunting for local trophy hunting and the illegal trade in furs, traditional medicines, and {{for use of the}} meat in restaurants and food markets. They also sometimes get caught in snares that have been set to catch animals raiding crops, such as wild boar, sambar, and muntjac. More than 26,651 snares have so far been removed from <b>Saola</b> habitats by conservation groups.|$|E

50|$|Typhoon <b>Saola,</b> {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Gener and in Taiwan as Typhoon Sura, was a strong {{tropical}} cyclone affecting the Philippines, Taiwan and China. It was the ninth named storm and the fourth typhoon of the 2012 Pacific typhoon season. <b>Saola</b> {{is the name of}} a rare mammal found in Vietnam.|$|E
50|$|The {{scientific}} {{name of the}} <b>saola</b> is Pseudoryx nghetinhensis. It is the sole member of the genus Pseudoryx and is classified under the family Bovidae. The species was first described in 1993 by Vu Van Dung, Do Tuoc, biologists Pham Mong Giao and Nguyen Ngoc Chinh, Peter Arctander of the University of Copenhagen and John MacKinnon. The discovery of <b>saola</b> remains in 1992 generated huge scientific interest due to the animal's special physical traits. The <b>saola</b> differs significantly from all other bovid genera in appearance and morphology, enough to place it in its own genus (Pseudoryx).|$|E
50|$|<b>Saola</b> inhabit wet {{evergreen}} or deciduous {{forests in}} eastern Indochina, preferring rivers and valleys. Sightings {{have been reported}} from steep river valleys at 300-1800 m above sea level. In Vietnam and Laos, their range appears to cover approximately 5000 km2, including four nature reserves. During the winters, <b>Saola</b> tend to migrate down to the lowlands.|$|E

50|$|Very little {{information}} is available about the reproductive cycles of the <b>saola.</b> The <b>saola</b> {{is likely to have}} a fixed mating season, from late August to mid-November; only single-calf births have been documented, mainly during summer (mid-April to late June). In the absence of more specific data, the gestation period has been estimated as similar to that of Tragelaphus species (about 33 weeks). Three reports of <b>saola</b> killings from nearby villagers involved young accompanying mothers. One possessed 9.5 cm long horns, another an estimated 15 cm, and the third 18.8 cm; these varying horn lengths suggest a birth season extending over at least two to three months.|$|E

50|$|A {{tropical}} disturbance formed from the monsoon and moved northwest on September 15. The next day, {{it became more}} organized and the Japan Meteorological Agency initiated a warning for Tropical Depression 18W southwest of Marcus Island, Japan at 0000 UTC (0900 JST), September 20. The depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm <b>Saola</b> 18 hours later as it continued to strengthen moving westward. Due to a normal speed of a typhoon and warm waters, <b>Saola</b> became a typhoon and reached peak intensity early on September 22. The strorm didn't made landfall but it affect Japan from September 23 to 25 by bringing heavy rainfall. <b>Saola</b> weakened to a tropical storm and became extratropical on September 26.|$|E
50|$|Locals have {{reported}} that the <b>saola</b> is active in the day {{as well as at}} night, but prefers rest during the hot midday hours. Robichaud noted that the captive female was active mainly during the day, but pointed out that the observation could have been influenced by the unfamiliar surroundings the animal found herself in. When she rested, she would draw her forelegs inward to her belly, extend her neck so that her chin touched the ground, and close her eyes. Though apparently solitary, <b>saola</b> have been reported in groups of two or three as well as up to six or seven. Grouping patterns in <b>saola</b> resemble those of the bushbuck, anoa, and sitatunga.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Saola</b> Working Group SWG is {{a working}} group of the IUCN Species Survival Commission's Asian Wild Cattle Specialist Group, created in 2006 to protect the saolas (Pseudoryx nghetinhensis) and their habitat. The Conservancy works to engage and {{incorporate}} local communities in protecting saolas in Annamite Range mountains {{on the border of}} Laos and Vietnam.The <b>Saola</b> {{is one of the most}} endangered species in the world. Discovered in 1992 it was the first large mammal new to science in more than 50 years and has never been seen by a biologist in the wild.The <b>Saola</b> Working Group is a coalition that includes about 40 experts from the forestry departments of Laos and Vietnam, Vietnam's Institute of Ecology and Biological Resources, Vinh University, biologists and conservationists from Wildlife Conservation Society and the World Wildlife Fund.|$|E
50|$|In a 1998 publication, William G. Robichaud, the {{coordinator}} of the <b>Saola</b> Working Group, recorded physical measurements for a captive female <b>saola</b> in a Laotian menagerie. The animal was observed for around 15 days, until she died from unknown causes. Robichaud noted {{the height of the}} female as 84 cm at the shoulder; the back was slightly elevated, nearly 12 cm taller than the shoulder height. The head-and-body length was recorded as 150 cm. The general characteristics of the <b>saola,</b> as shown by studies during 1993-5 as well as the 1998 study, include a chocolate brown coat with patches of white on the face, throat and the sides of the neck, a paler shade of brown on the neck and the belly, a black dorsal stripe, a pair of nearly parallel horns (present on both sexes).|$|E
50|$|Since its {{physical}} traits are so complex to classify, Pseudoryx had been classified variously as {{member of the}} Caprinae subfamily and as belonging {{to any of the}} three tribes of the Bovinae subfamily: Boselaphini, Bovini and Tragelaphini. Recent DNA analysis has led scientists to place the <b>saola</b> {{as a member of the}} tribe Bovini. The morphology of its horns, teeth and some other features indicate it should be grouped with less-derived or more ancestral bovids. Scientific consensus may lead to classifying the <b>saola</b> as the sole member of a proposed new tribe Pseudorygini.|$|E
