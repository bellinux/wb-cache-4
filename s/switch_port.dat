25|$|Yooka-Laylee is a {{platform}} video game developed by Playtonic Games {{and published by}} Team17. The game was released in April 2017 for Linux, macOS, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, with a Nintendo <b>Switch</b> <b>port</b> still in development.|$|E
25|$|Sonic Mania was {{released}} digitally for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in North America and Europe on August 15, 2017, and in Japan the following day. Tantalus Media {{helped develop the}} Nintendo <b>Switch</b> <b>port</b> of the game. Four days before release, Sega delayed the Microsoft Windows version for another two weeks for further optimization, releasing it on August 29. As compensation, those who had pre-ordered the game received {{a copy of the}} original Sonic the Hedgehog on Steam.|$|E
500|$|Due to Sony's initial lack of {{interest}} in the game, Team Meat entered into contractual obligations that prohibited Super Meat Boy from ever being released on the PlayStation 3. Despite this a version for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita was eventually announced [...] The WiiWare version was canceled because the game's file size had been expanded beyond the limits imposed by Nintendo. Team Meat looked into releasing it as a retail Wii game, but were told by all third-party publishers they approached that a budget title would not be profitable so late into the Wii's lifecycle. However, after Team Meat hinted it in October 2015, Super Meat Boy has been confirmed for the Wii U eShop via a release reel shown on the European Nintendo Direct of March 2016. The Wii U port is handled by BlitWorks, a separate indie developer, and was released in 2016. Team Meat announced a Nintendo <b>Switch</b> <b>port</b> in August 2017, though did not confirm a release date.|$|E

50|$|An Ethernet switch {{operates}} {{at the data}} link layer (layer 2) of the OSI model to create a separate collision domain for each <b>switch</b> <b>port.</b> Each device connected to a <b>switch</b> <b>port</b> can transfer data {{to any of the}} other ones at a time, and the transmissions will not interfere with the limitation that, in half duplex mode, each <b>switch</b> <b>port</b> can only either receive from or transmit to its connected device at a certain time. In full duplex mode, each <b>switch</b> <b>port</b> can simultaneously transmit and receive, assuming the connected device also supports full duplex mode.|$|E
50|$|Another {{method to}} monitor {{may be to}} connect a layer-1 hub between the {{monitored}} device and its <b>switch</b> <b>port.</b> This will induce minor delay, but will provide multiple interfaces {{that can be used}} to monitor the individual <b>switch</b> <b>port.</b>|$|E

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in generalized multiprotocol label switching (GMPLS) [1, 12] and the extensive study {{and understanding of}} packet-over-optical network architecture, {{has made it possible}} for a single integrated control plane to manage the resources of the packet network and underlying optical transport network in an unified manner. This opens up the possibility for coordinated actions across the two networking layers. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a joint protection/restoration scheme for a future packet-over-optical network. Since packet <b>switch</b> <b>ports</b> are typically more expensive than optical <b>switch</b> <b>ports,</b> the essence of the approach is to attempt to reuse packet service ports or the service wavelengths associated with optical <b>switch</b> <b>ports</b> for restoration rather than reserve additional standby packet ports exclusively for network recovery. This can be done when there are concerted actions between the packet and optical transport layers...|$|R

30|$|Impact: Fig.  1 b {{shows the}} impact stage. During the impact {{preparation}} stage, the impact piston is retracted, and piston edge 1 passes through port PP 2 {{so that the}} supplied hydraulic oil flows into the <b>switching</b> <b>port</b> of the valve. The hydraulic oil introduced into the <b>switching</b> <b>port</b> {{is applied to the}} receiving pressure area, which pushes the valve spool to the right. This pushing action switches the valve, and the supplied hydraulic oil is introduced into piston port PP 4 through valve port P 1 so that the piston starts the impact stroke (Lee et al. 2003).|$|R
30|$|In smart substation, {{line bay}} {{has the most}} <b>switch</b> <b>ports.</b> Generally, one line bay {{includes}} 1 merging unit, 1 intelligent terminal unit, 2 line protection devices and 1 BCU. Five <b>switch</b> <b>ports</b> is enough for one bay, but a switch generally has 16 ports, which are enough for 3 bays. When a switch used for 3 bays is faulty, all the 3 bays will lose their protection, measuring and control functions. The solution is to limit the connected <b>ports</b> of a <b>switch</b> for only one bay. In this way, the failure of one switch will only affect one bay.|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In this work, {{we compare}} three optical {{transport}} network architectures: optical packet switching (OPS), optical flow switching (OFS), and optical burst switching (OBS). Our comparison {{is based on}} a notion of network capacity as the set of exogenous traffic rates that can be stably supported by a network under its operational constraints. We characterize the capacity regions of the transport architectures, and show that the capacity region of OPS dominates that of OFS, and that the capacity region of OFS dominates that of OBS. Motivated by the incommensurate complexity/cost of comparable transport architectures, we investigate the dependence of their relative capacity performance on the number of <b>switch</b> <b>ports</b> per fiber at core nodes. We find that when OFS and OBS core nodes have significantly many more <b>switch</b> <b>ports</b> per fiber than OPS core nodes, then the capacity regions of OFS and OBS (in the absence of receiver collisions) dominate that of OPS; and when the number of <b>switch</b> <b>ports</b> per fiber is only moderately more in OFS and OBS than in OPS, then it is possible that OFS and OBS do not dominate OPS, but are not dominated by OPS either.

5000|$|Port {{mirroring}} [...] {{is used on}} {{a network}} switch to send a copy of network packets seen on one <b>switch</b> <b>port</b> (or an entire VLAN) to a network monitoring connection on another <b>switch</b> <b>port.</b> This is commonly used for network appliances that require monitoring of network traffic such as an intrusion detection system, passive probe or real user monitoring (RUM) technology {{that is used to}} support application performance management (APM). Port mirroring on a Cisco Systems switch is generally referred to as Switched Port Analyzer (SPAN) or Remote Switched Port Analyzer (RSPAN). Other vendors have different names for it, such as Roving Analysis Port (RAP) on 3Com switches.|$|E
