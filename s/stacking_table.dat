The movement direction of the movable suction piece (6) extends at such an angle (beta) in relation to gravity (G) that the resultant from the lift movement occurring during the vacuum phase and the fall movement of the sheet occurring during the pressure phase obtains a component pointing in the intended direction of conveyance (F). In order to span large stack heights, an additional adjustment device is provided for the movable suction piece or a level-regulated <b>stacking</b> <b>table</b> (2, 4).

40|$|As a {{composite}} <b>table,</b> a <b>stack</b> <b>table</b> {{is made up}} of a varying number of child tables that are placed one on top of another without any gaps. Unlike a regular table that has a fixed number of columns throughout the rows, a typical <b>stack</b> <b>table</b> allows each of its child tables to have its own number of columns and headers and each can vary its size, layout and style separately. A <b>stack</b> <b>table</b> hence gives a much greater freedom and creativity to the data presentation than a regular <b>table</b> does. <b>Stack</b> <b>tables</b> are commonly used in complex reports because of their effective integration of statistical results from multiple sources and flexible presentations of various aspects of concerns. In this paper, we extend the method introduced in [1] and present another macro called %GluePlus that can assemble multiple separate tables in a RTF file into a single <b>stack</b> <b>table.</b> The new macro is implemented by taking advantage of the power of Microsoft scripting technology via the SAS unnamed pipe mechanism. Based on the %GluePlus, an improved programming framework is provided for creating all kinds of <b>stack</b> <b>tables</b> systematically with a series of Data Steps, Proc Template and Proc Report Steps. A complete example is presented at the end to demonstrate the powerfulness and flexibility of the technique described in this paper...|$|R

50|$|A {{new feature}} {{introduced}} in the AMD64 extensions is called the Interrupt <b>Stack</b> <b>Table</b> (IST), which also resides in the TSS and contains logical (segment+offset) stack pointers. If an interrupt descriptor table specifies an IST entry to use (there are 8), the processor will load the new stack from the IST instead. This allows known-good stacks {{to be used in}} case of serious errors (NMI or Double fault for example). Previously, the entry for the exception or interrupt in the IDT pointed to a task gate, causing the processor to switch to the task that is pointed by the task gate. The original register values were saved in the TSS current at the time the interrupt or exception occurred. The processor then set the registers, including SS:ESP, to a known value specified in the TSS and saved the selector to the previous TSS. The problem here is that hardware task switching is not supported on AMD64.|$|R

After many business changes by the WGTW-48 production team over the years, including a time slot change from Saturdays at 9.00PM to a weeknight at midnight slot, to compete with other promotions, this idea was a failure and Fake You TV continued to strive. CZW continued to endure every business decision that WGTW-48 formulated and executed until the channel decided not to air the June 18, 2004 episode due to its content, through negative effects on the fans and after much consideration, CZW decided to withdraw the show indefinitely.|$|R
