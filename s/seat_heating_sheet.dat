40|$|Abstract. A {{forming process}} for <b>heated</b> <b>sheet</b> metal, such as hot-stamping, has limited use in {{deformable}} shapes. Higher temperature areas {{which have not}} yet {{come into contact with}} dies are more easily deformed; therefore, local deformation occurs at these areas which leads to breakage. To improve the formability of <b>heated</b> <b>sheet</b> metal, a deformation control technique utilizing the temperature dependence of flow stress is proposed. This technique can suppress local deformation by partial cooling around potential cracking areas to harden them before forming. In order to apply this technique to a variety of product shapes, a procedure to determine a suitable initial temperature distribution for deep drawing and biaxial stretching was developed with a coupled thermal-structural simulation. In this procedure, finite elements exceeding forming limit strain are highlighted, and an initial temperature distribution is defined with areas of decreased temperature around the elements to increase their resistance to deformation. Subsequently, the partial cooling technique was applied to a deep drawing test with a <b>heated</b> steel <b>sheet.</b> The results of the experiment showed that the proposed technique improved 71 % in the forming limit depth compared with results obtained using a uniform initial temperature distribution. ...|$|R

50|$|Cold stamping, {{also known}} as press working, is a {{manufacturing}} operation in which thermoplastics in sheet form are cold-formed using methods {{similar to those used}} in metalworking.
