25|$|The CHMSL is {{intended}} to provide a warning to drivers whose view of the vehicle's left and right stop lamps is blocked by interceding vehicles. It also provides a redundant <b>stop</b> <b>light</b> signal {{in the event of}} a stop lamp malfunction. In North America where rear turn signals are permitted to emit red light, the CHMSL also helps to disambiguate brake lights from rear position lights and turn signal lights.|$|E

25|$|Citroën {{unveiled}} {{the car at}} the Paris Salon on 7 October 1948. The car on display was nearly identical to the 2CV type A that would be sold the next year, but it lacked an electric starter, the addition of which was decided {{the day before the}} opening of the Salon, replacing the pull cord starter. The canvas roof could be rolled completely open. The Type A had one <b>stop</b> <b>light,</b> and was only available in grey. The fuel level was checked with a dip stick/measuring rod, and the speedometer was attached to the windscreen pillar. The only other instrument was an ammeter.|$|E
25|$|The {{requirement}} of road signals that a <b>stop</b> <b>light</b> should be visible over a queue of traffic {{and as far}} back as possible (thus demanding an order with red above) does not apply to railways with a block signalling system as there is no traffic queuing within a block, there being only one train in a block at a time. With railway signals, red need not be at the top for maximum visibility over distance as the driver of a train will already be expecting a red signal, having passed a yellow one in the previous block. This advance warning is missing with road signals.|$|E
500|$|In 1924, Satyendra Nath Bose derived Planck's law of black-body {{radiation}} {{without using}} any electromagnetism, {{but rather by}} using a modification of coarse-grained counting of phase space. Einstein showed that this modification is equivalent to assuming that photons are rigorously identical and that it implied a [...] "mysterious non-local interaction", now understood as the requirement for a symmetric quantum mechanical state. This work led {{to the concept of}} coherent states and the development of the laser. In the same papers, Einstein extended Bose's formalism to material particles (bosons) and predicted that they would condense into their lowest quantum state at low enough temperatures; this Bose–Einstein condensation was observed experimentally in 1995. It was later used by Lene Hau to slow, and then completely <b>stop,</b> <b>light</b> in 1999 and 2001.|$|E

500|$|MDOT {{engineers}} touted the constant-flowing {{nature of}} the design as a benefit to the new intersection, and city planners promoted the enhanced safety aspects of the project. Both parties stated the planned intersection was less expensive than a conventional <b>stop</b> <b>light.</b> Residents have expressed concerns about snow plowing and truck traffic in the intersection. The designers consulted officials of Avon, Colorado, where several roundabouts are situated in a location that averages over [...] of annual snowfall. Designers planned {{the size of the}} new intersection to accommodate truck traffic. MDOT has stated that many of the concerns expressed are due to misconceptions and unfounded assumptions about the design. The department held an informational meeting with the residents on April 15, 2010 before construction began. Topics ranged from emergency vehicles, plowing, trucks, accidents and detour plans.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, {{the county}} road {{commission}} built an extension to Commerce Drive across US41/M-28. This extension {{was designed to}} connect the southern and northern segments of CR492 severed by traffic flow changes along US41/M-28. Traffic wishing to cross between the two segments needs to follow US41/M-28 to a median turn around in a maneuver similar to a Michigan left. After the project was completed, motorists gained a second option to cross between the two segments of CR492 following Brookton Road to the Commerce Drive extension and around the Westwood Mall to Wright Street. This newer connector is designed for [...] traffic. The <b>stop</b> <b>light</b> at the US41/M-28 intersection was installed in early November to complete the project.

M-28 on a map in 1975; this second designation was removed from maps by 1982. The entire business loop was turned back to local control in a [...] "route swap" [...] between the City of Marquette and MDOT announced in early 2005. The proposal transferred jurisdiction on the unsigned M-554 and the business route from the state to the city. The state would take jurisdiction over a segment of McClellan Avenue to be used to extend M-553 to US41/M-28. In addition, MDOT would pay $2.5million (equivalent to $ in [...] ) for reconstruction work planned for 2007. The transfer would increase Marquette's operational and maintenance liability expenses by $26,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] ) and place the financial burden of the future replacement of a <b>stop</b> <b>light</b> on the city. On October 10, 2005, MDOT and Marquette transferred jurisdiction over the three roadways. As a result, Bus. US41 was decommissioned when the local government took control over Washington and Front streets. As a result of the decommissioning, the 2006 maps did not show the former business loop.|$|E

2500|$|During 1982–1992, {{approximately}} 84 fatal crashes {{per year}} {{occurred in the}} U.S. where a vehicle was turning right at intersections where right turn on red was permitted. As of 1992, right turn on red is governed federally by (c) ("Each proposed State energy conservation plan {{to be eligible for}} Federal assistance under this part shall include: ...(5) a traffic law or regulation which, to the maximum extent practicable consistent with safety, permits the operator of a motor vehicle to turn such vehicle right at a red <b>stop</b> <b>light</b> after stopping, and to turn such vehicle left from a one-way street onto a one-way street at a red light after stopping.").

The coupe and sedans models also {{received a}} slight redesign {{to the bottom of}} the rear bumper. On the pre-facelift sedans, the <b>stop</b> <b>lights</b> were on top of the reverse and turn lights; for the facelift version, the reverse and turn lights were on top of the <b>stop</b> <b>lights.</b> For the coupe and hatchback the layouts remained as before; however, the rear turn signal lenses became clear/white instead of amber to match the reverse lights (the turn light bulbs themselves now were amber).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Stopped</b> <b>light,</b> in {{the context}} of an EIT medium, refers to the {{coherent}} transfer of photons to the quantum system and back again. In principle, this involves switching off the coupling beam in an adiabatic fashion while the probe pulse is still inside of the EIT medium. There is experimental evidence of trapped pulses in EIT medium. In [...] authors created a stationary light pulse inside the atomic coherent media. In 2009 researchers from Harvard University and MIT demonstrated a few-photon optical switch for quantum optics based on the slow light ideas. Lene Hau and a team from Harvard University were the first to demonstrate <b>stopped</b> <b>light.</b>|$|R

The electrical motor assist adds another [...] {{and a maximum}} of 36 pound-feet (49 Nm) of torque when called on, with the aim to boost performance {{to the level of}} a typical 1.5 L petrol engine. It also acts as a generator during deceleration and braking to recharge the vehicle's batteries, and as the Insight's starter motor. (This improves fuel efficiency and extends the lifetime and fade resistance of the brakes, without adding unsprung weight). When the car is not moving, for example at a <b>stop</b> <b>light,</b> the engine shuts off. Power steering is electric, reducing accessory drag.|$|E
2500|$|Inauguration of {{the light}} rail service was {{postponed}} four times. The initial date was January 2009, deferred to August 2010 due to funding problems and lack of staff. When {{it was announced that}} signals for the trains was not compatible with Israeli <b>stop</b> <b>light</b> systems, CityPass was given until April 2011, but after the problem persisted and other safety issues were not resolved, an August 2011 date was settled on, and service was to begin without giving priority to trains at traffic lights. As a result, travel time for the full route began at 80 minutes instead of the planned 42, until final synchronization {{of the light}}s is completed. When the light rail started operating on Friday, August 19, 2011, there were also air conditioning issues and electrical and communications problems, one of them making trains suddenly [...] "disappear" [...] and then [...] "reappear" [...] on the screens of the control center near French Hill. In addition to these mishaps, the computerized ticketing system collapsed {{a few days before the}} inauguration. After arbitration between CityPass and government officials, it was decided that the trains would begin limited operation as scheduled. During the trial period, only 14 of the 21 trains were put into operation, departing every 21 minutes, and travel was free of charge. Full revenue service began on December 1, 2011.|$|E
2500|$|After being awarded her bachelor's {{degree in}} Mathematics in 1984, Hau {{continued}} {{to study at}} the University of Aarhus for her master's degree in Physics which was awarded two years later. For her doctoral studies in quantum theory Hau worked on ideas similar to those involved in fibre optic cables carrying light, but her work involved strings of atoms in a silicon crystal carrying electrons. While working towards her doctorate Hau spent seven months at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics near Geneva. She received her doctorate from the University of Aarhus in Denmark in 1991, but by this time her research interests had changed direction. In 1991 she joined the Rowland Institute for Science at Cambridge, Massachusetts as a scientific staff member, beginning to explore the possibilities of slow light and cold atoms. In 1999, Hau accepted a two-year appointment as a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University. Her formalized training is in theoretical physics but her interest moved to experimental research {{in an effort to}} create a new form of matter known as a Bose–Einstein condensate. [...] "Hau applied to the National Science Foundation for funds to make a batch of this condensate but was rejected on the grounds that she was a theorist for whom such experiments would be too difficult to do." [...] Undeterred, she gained alternative funding, and {{became one of the first}} handful of physicists to create such a condensate. In September 1999 she was appointed the Gordon Mckay Professor of Applied Physics and Professor of Physics at Harvard. She was also awarded tenure in 1999, and is now Mallinckrodt Professor of Physics and Applied Physics at Harvard. In 2001 she became the first person to <b>stop</b> <b>light</b> completely, using a Bose–Einstein condensate to achieve this. Since then she has produced copious research, and new experimental work, in electromagnetically induced transparency, various areas of quantum physics, photonics and contributed to the development of new quantum devices and novel nanoscale applications.|$|E
