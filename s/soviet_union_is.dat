5|$|The Cold War {{was a major}} political, {{economic}} and military endeavor for over four decades, but the confrontation between the two superpowers had decreased dramatically {{by the end of}} Reagan's presidency. The significance of Reagan's role in ending the Cold War has spurred contentious and opinionated debate. That Reagan played a role in contributing to the downfall of the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>is</b> agreed, but the extent of this role is continuously debated, with many believing that Reagan's defense policies, economic policies, military policies and hard line rhetoric against the Soviet Union and Communism, as well as summits with General Secretary Gorbachev played a significant part in ending the Cold War.|$|E

5|$|Kidnappers violently {{take the}} Secret Service chief M {{from his house}} and almost capture James Bond, who is visiting. Intent on rescuing M, Bond follows the clues to Vrakonisi, one of the Aegean Islands. In the process, Bond discovers the complex military-political plans of Colonel Sun of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Sun {{had been sent to}} {{sabotage}} a Middle East détente conference which the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>is</b> hosting. He intends to attack the conference venue and use M and Bond's bodies to blame Great Britain for the disaster, leading to a world war. Bond meets Soviet agents in Athens and they realise that not only is a third country behind the kidnap, but that there is a traitor in the organisation. An attack on the Soviet headquarters kills all the agents except Ariadne Alexandrou, a Greek Communist. As he is dying, the Soviet leader encourages Bond and Ariadne to work together to prevent an international incident.|$|E
5|$|Several {{individuals}} have consistently scored highly and/or earned medals on the IMO: As of July 2015 Zhuo Qun Song (Canada) {{is the most}} successful participant with five gold medals (including one perfect score in 2015) and one bronze medal. Reid Barton (United States) was the first participant to win a gold medal four times (1998-2001). Barton {{is also one of}} only eight four-time Putnam Fellow (2001–04). Christian Reiher (Germany), Lisa Sauermann (Germany), Teodor von Burg (Serbia), and Nipun Pitimanaaree (Thailand) are the only other participants to have won four gold medals (2000–03, 2008–11, 2009–12, 2010–13, and 2011–14 respectively); Reiher also received a bronze medal (1999), Sauermann a silver medal (2007), von Burg a silver medal (2008) and a bronze medal (2007), and Pitimanaaree a silver medal (2009). Wolfgang Burmeister (East Germany), Martin Härterich (West Germany), Iurie Boreico (Moldova), and Lim Jeck (Singapore) are the only other participants besides Reiher, Sauermann, von Burg, and Pitimanaaree to win five medals with at least three of them gold. Ciprian Manolescu (Romania) managed to write a perfect paper (42 points) for gold medal more times than anybody else {{in the history of the}} competition, doing it all three times he participated in the IMO (1995, 1996, 1997). Manolescu is also a three-time Putnam Fellow (1997, 1998, 2000). Eugenia Malinnikova (<b>Soviet</b> <b>Union)</b> <b>is</b> the highest-scoring female contestant in IMO history.

25|$|The {{risk for}} supply interruptions {{aimed at the}} states of the Former <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>is</b> present today. Depending on {{bilateral}} relations and the present context, the risk for partial and/or short-duration cut-offs is high. Since 1991, the energy lever has been used for putting political or economic pressure on Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine, Belarus, Moldova, Georgia that subsequently affected most of Europe. The number of incidents, i.e. cut-offs, take-overs, coercive price policy, blackmail or threats, is over fifty in total (of which about forty are cut-offs). Incidents appear to be equally divided between the Yeltsin and Putin eras, but the number of cut-offs has decreased by half during Putin. The immediate reasons for Russia’s coercive policy appear to be political concession in ongoing negotiations, infrastructure take-over, and execution of economically favorable deals or to make political statements. There are economic underpinnings in the majority of the cases and Russian demands for payments of debts are legitimate. However, there are also political underpinnings in {{more than half of the}} incidents, and in a few cases explicit political demands are evident.|$|E

500|$|In January 1977, {{four years}} prior to {{becoming}} president, Ronald Reagan bluntly stated, {{in a conversation with}} Richard V. Allen, his basic expectation in relation to the Cold War. [...] "My idea of American policy toward the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>is</b> simple, and some would say simplistic," [...] he said. [...] "It is this: We win and they lose. What do you think of that?" [...] In 1980, Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, vowing to increase military spending and confront the Soviets everywhere. Both Reagan and new British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher denounced the Soviet Union and its ideology. Reagan labeled the Soviet Union an [...] "evil empire" [...] and predicted that Communism would be left on the [...] "ash heap of history," [...] while Thatcher inculpated the Soviets as [...] "bent on world dominance." ...|$|E
500|$|On 17 June 1985, National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane wrote a National Security Decision Directive {{which called}} for the United States to begin a {{rapprochement}} with the Islamic Republic of Iran. The paper read:Dynamic political evolution is taking place inside Iran.

The <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>is</b> better positioned than the U.S. to exploit and benefit from any power struggle that results in changes from the Iranian regime...The U.S should encourage Western allies and friends to help Iran meet its import requirements so as to reduce the attractiveness of Soviet assistance...This includes provision of selected military equipment. Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger was highly negative, writing on his copy of McFarlane's paper: [...] "This is almost too absurd to comment on...like asking Qaddafi to Washington for a cozy chat." [...] Secretary of State George Shultz was also opposed, stating that having designated Iran a State Sponsor of Terrorism in January 1984, how could the United States possibly sell arms to Iran? Only the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency William Casey supported McFarlane's plan to start selling arms to Iran.|$|E

500|$|Thief began {{development}} in April 1996. For the game's original designer and writer Ken Levine, credited by The Telegraph as [...] "a {{key figure in}} the creation" [...] of Thief, inspirations came from two of his favourite games, Castle Wolfenstein and Diablo. The initial concept was to make an action role-playing game and Levine was given the job of designing the game's world and story. Levine said the initial ideas and projects that have later morphed into Dark Camelot, before eventually evolving into The Dark Project, included School of Wizards, Dark Elves Must Die and Better Red Than Undead, the latter of which was [...] "a campy story" [...] about communist zombies. The game {{was supposed to be}} a first-person sword fighting simulator, but [...] "the marketing [...] killed the idea," [...] to his disappointment. According to programmer Marc LeBlanc, [...] "The first proposal was Better Red Than Undead, a '50s Cold War game where the <b>Soviet</b> <b>Union</b> <b>is</b> overrun with zombies and you have to go hack them to pieces as the loner from the CIA because bullets don't work on the undead." [...] Doug Church said the game's design was built around the idea [...] "of having factions who you could ally with or oppose yourself with or do things for or not." ...|$|E
500|$|German Claudia Pechstein has won nine medals—five gold, two silver, and two bronze—more {{than any}} other speed skater at the Olympics.

At the 1964 Games, Skoblikova won four gold medals and became the first athlete to win a gold in every available event. [...] The feat was repeated in 1980 by American Eric Heiden, who won five golds, the most that any Winter Olympian has won at one edition of the Games. In 2006, Canadian Cindy Klassen became the only other speed skater, and one of seven Winter Olympians, to win five medals—one gold, two silver, two bronze—at a single edition of the Games. Pechstein and American Bonnie Blair are the only speed skaters to win gold in the same event three times in a row. Andrea Schöne, who won a silver medal in 1976, is the youngest female athlete in an individual event to win a medal.
