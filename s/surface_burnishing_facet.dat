Oxidation of this lubricant in air at 150 C produces {{a significant increase in the}} molybdenum oxide to sulfide ratio, indicative of degradation of the primary lubricating constituent of the composite lubricant. Oxidation is more extensive on samples that were burnished such that the substrate is exposed over a fraction of the surface, relative to those which were only lightly burnished. Friction results indicate that oxidation in air did not increase the initial or steady-state friction coefficient for lightly <b>burnished</b> <b>surfaces.</b> However, <b>surfaces</b> <b>burnished</b> to expose substrate material experienced a significant increase in both initial and steady-state friction.

40|$|Modern {{production}} technology requires {{new ways}} of surface examination and {{a special kind of}} surface profile parameters. Industrial quality inspection needs to be fast, reliable and inexpensive. In this paper it is shown how stochastic surface examination and its proper parameters could be a solution for many industrial problems not necessarily related with smoothing out a manufactured <b>surface.</b> <b>Burnishing</b> is a modern technology widely used in aircraft and automotive industries to the products as well as to process tools. It gives to the machined surface high smoothness, and good fatigue and wear resistance. Every burnished material behaves in a different manner. Process conditions strongly influence the final properties of any specific product. Optimum burnishing conditions should be preserved for any manufactured product. In this paper we deal with samples made of conventional tool steel – Sverker 21 (X 153 CrMoV 12) and powder metallurgy (P/M) tool steel – Vanadis 6. Complete investigations of product properties are impossible to perform (because of constraints related to their cost, time, or lack of suitable equipment). Looking for a global, all-embracing quality indicator {{it was found that the}} correlation function and the frequency analysis of <b>burnished</b> <b>surface</b> give useful information for controlling the manufacturing process and evaluating the product quality. We propose three new indicators of <b>burnishing</b> <b>surface</b> quality. Their properties and usefulness are verified with the laboratory measurement of material samples made of the two mentioned kinds of tool steel...|$|R

In this investigation work mechanical (friction) burnishing process will be presented. First a rig has been redesigned and improved and tested for mechanical burnishing operations. Then the experimental setup and tests will be presented. After that a detailed discussion about the reasons for fluctuations of normal load, friction force and coefficient of friction will be presented. The surfaces conditions, roughness and hardness also will be discussed. The parameters that affect the friction burnishing and their sequence are concluded.

Finish {{blanking}} {{is one of}} {{the precision}} shearing processes and it has some features such as the formability of a high ratio of the <b>burnished</b> <b>surface,</b> lower surface expansion ratio of the <b>burnished</b> <b>surface.</b> The purpose of the present work is to clarify the effect of the tool shape in finish blanking on galling behavior. A high-tensile-strength-steel plate with a thickness of 6 mm is used in the present paper. The edge shape of punch is changed while the clearance is kept to 12 %t. Galling is observed except for the PW punch with the edge angle of 30 degrees at the first shearing operation. In the case of the PW punch with the edge angle of 30 degrees, galling can’t be found clearly even when the shearing number increases until 20. The <b>burnished</b> <b>surface</b> has a glossy part with the clean metal for the punches except for the PW punch with the edge angle of 30 degree.

Fretting tests lubricated with mineral oil were performed on a pure copper (PC) against a Si 3 N 4 ball. The <b>burnished</b> <b>surface</b> exhibited a significantly improved fretting wear resistance and higher friction coefficient {{in comparison with the}} coarse-grained (CG) form. The wear volume of the burnished PC is quite lower than that of the CG PC. The friction coefficient of the CG PC increases with an increasing load, while the friction coefficient of burnished PC decreases with an increasing load up to 100 N and then increases. The enhanced wear properties of the <b>burnished</b> <b>surface</b> are correlated with the compressive residual stress and work-hardening, which may partly result from grain refinement induced by burnishing...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A direct {{punching}} of inclined ultra-high strength {{steel sheets}} having low ductility {{was carried out}} {{to improve the quality}} of the sheared edge. In the direct punching of an inclined sheet, the contact between the sheet and punch became gradual because of touch from the bottom edge of the punch, and thus the sheared portion tended to bend in the latter half of punching. As the strength of the sheet increased, defects such as burr and secondary <b>burnished</b> <b>surface</b> were occurred around the sheared edge due to the low ductility. The range of direct punching for sheared edge without defects was shown for the high strength steel sheets. To prevent the occurrence of defects, a punch having inclined bottom was used. In this punch, the contact with the sheet was changed, the uniform contact with the inclined bottom was given. In the punch having the inclined bottom, the secondary <b>burnished</b> <b>surface</b> in the edge of 980 MPa grade steel sheet was prevented...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of the research was to improve the wear resistance of titanium alloys by ball burnishing process. Burnishing process parameters such as burnishing speed, burnishing feed, burnishing force and number of pass were considered to minimize the specific wear rate and coefficient of friction. Taguchi optimization results revealed that burnishing force and number of pass were the significant parameters for minimizing the specific wear rate, whereas the burnishing feed and speed play important roles in minimizing the coefficient of friction. After <b>burnishing</b> <b>surface</b> microhardness increased from 340 to 405 Hv, surface roughness decreased from 0. 45 to 0. 12 μm and compressive residual stress were generated immediately below the <b>burnished</b> <b>surface.</b> The optimization results showed that specific wear rate decreased by 52 %, whereas coefficient of friction was reduced by 64 % {{as compared to the}} turned surface.

The prospects of using structurally modified and structurally inhomogeneous materials based on titanium and aluminum alloys were shown. The analysis of power loading schemes of isothermal extrusion was made. Typical schemes of loading {{as a result}} of structural and logical analysis were classified depending on the impact of shear stresses, which are proportional to the forces of friction, on the overall stress state in the cell strains. The general method of work, which includes the method of theoretical numerical and experimental analysis was considered. The theory of plastic flow is proposed for theoretical analysis. A new approach for calculation of shear strains in the overall process of deformation was created based on the general equations of the theory of plastic flow continuum. Based on the proposed approach, it was considered the process of extrusion with active friction forces that create large shear deformation in the cross section of the channel through which the solid medium moves. The research of isothermal forging process for screw expanding extrusion was carried out. Based on theoretical models the kinematic relationships of the deformation process was studied and contribution of shear deformation on the formation of the microstructure of the metal after deformation was determined. In a production environment shows promising The prospects of further treatment of modified metals by screw forging for following stamping processes, such as hot extrusion, was demonstrated in production environment The process of intense plastic deformation in the center of deformation during of drawing of bimetallic materials with thinning with heating was investigated. Theoretic models were obtained for calculation of combined drawing with thinning of two-layer cylindrical workpiece for perfectly-plastic material as well as a theoretical model of drawing of two-layer workpiece with regard to the forces of friction on the contact surfaces of the workpiece with the matrix and punch, between layers of dissimilar metals.
