5000|$|Ostyn's {{energetic}} and charismatic personality made {{him into a}} leading international personality in sports medicine. He combined his job as an academic educator and scholar with several other functions. Since 1955 he would be treasurer of the International University Sports Federation (FISU). He was also president and {{founding member of the}} Belgian Society for Sports Medicine & <b>Sports</b> Science, <b>and</b> chaired the first Belgian Anti-doping Committee. He was a founder of the Institute of Physical Education's scholarly periodical 'Hermes' in which he regularly authored articles himself. He also founded the sports medical clinic at the Institute of Physical Education, in which he would provide advice and support to both students and top athletes. After P-P. De Nayer's retirement, Ostyn became Chair (Dean) of the Institute of Physical Education, which he remained until 1986. During that time he was an adviser to numerous research students in kinesiology and in physical therapy. His research interests included <b>sports</b> injuries, <b>metabolic</b> <b>and</b> endocrine responses to exercise, cardiopulmonary physiology, and regulation of carbohydrate and fat metabolism.|$|R
40|$|To {{optimize}} the postexercise insulin response {{and to increase}} plasma amino acid availability, we studied postexercise insulin levels after the ingestion of carbohydrate and wheat protein hydrolysate with and without free leucine and phenylalanine. After an overnight fast, eight male cyclists visited our laboratory on five occasions, during which a control drink and two different beverage compositions in two different doses were tested. After they performed a glycogen-depletion protocol, subjects received a beverage (3. 5 mL · kg- 1) every 30 min to ensure an intake of 1. 2 g · kg- 1 · h- 1 carbohydrate and 0, 0. 2 or 0. 4 g · kg- 1 · h- 1 protein hydrolysate (and amino acid) mixture. After the insulin response was expressed as the area under the curve, only the ingestion of the beverages containing wheat protein hydrolysate, leucine and phenylalanine resulted in a marked increase in insulin response (+ 52 and + 107 % for the 0. 2 and 0. 4 g · kg- 1 · h- 1 mixtures, respectively; P < 0. 05) compared with the carbohydrate-only trial). A dose-related effect existed because doubling the dose (0. 2 - 0. 4 g · kg- 1 · h- 1) led to an additional rise in insulin response (P < 0. 05). Plasma leucine, phenylalanine and tyrosine concentrations showed strong correlations with the insulin response (P < 0. 0001). This study provides a practical tool to markedly elevate insulin levels and plasma amino acid availability through dietary manipulation, which may be of great value in clinical nutrition, (recovery) <b>sports</b> drinks <b>and</b> <b>metabolic</b> research.

40|$|After {{nearly a}} decade as the seventh Surgeon-in-Chief (1963 – 1972) of The Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS), Robert Lee Patterson, Jr., MD (1907 – 1994) retired, having {{repaired}} adverse relations between HSS and the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. Patterson, who had first joined the staff of The Hospital for the Ruptured and Crippled in 1936 as a Visiting Surgeon, was able to accomplish this very challenging task mainly through his close relationship with Preston Wade, MD (1901 – 1982), a general surgeon who had served with Patterson as Co-Chief of the combined New York Hospital-HSS Fracture service. The Board of Trustees of the New York Society for the Relief of the Ruptured and Crippled appointed Philip D. Wilson, Jr. MD, as the eighth Surgeon-in-Chief of The Hospital for Special Surgery. He assumed that office on July 1, 1972. Wilson, who had joined the staff as an Orthopaedic Surgeon to the Out-Patient Department in 1951, had trained as an orthopaedic resident at HSS from 1948 to 1950 and in 1951, finished his residency at the University of California Hospital Medical Center, San Francisco.

40|$|Abstract: Computational strategies, that {{integrate}} genomic-level information <b>and</b> <b>metabolic</b> flux data, {{have improved}} both prediction of <b>metabolic</b> fluxes <b>and</b> <b>metabolic</b> network identification. Due to the tight interplay between hierarchical (transcriptional) <b>and</b> <b>metabolic</b> control {{it is not}} clear how changes in gene expression drive changes in cellular phenotypes manifested through changes in metabolic fluxes. This raises the questions to what extent a change in a metabolic flux should be attributed to changes in gene expression and/or changes in metabolite concentrations and what kind of conclu-sions can be drawn by comparing gene expression profiles with the associated metabolic fluxes. This review addresses is-sues related to modeling approaches that attempt to integrate gene expression <b>and</b> <b>metabolic</b> flux data...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCurrent {{studies have}} {{indicated}} the association of chronic sterile inflammation (inflammation {{in the absence of}} pathogens) with the pathogenesis of age-related <b>and</b> <b>metabolic</b> diseases. The inflammation is under the control of transcription factor NF-κB through an antagonistic crosstalk between SIRT 1, PARP- 1, and - 2 signaling pathways. The transcriptional activity of NF-κB is increased in various tissues with aging <b>and</b> <b>metabolic</b> abnormalities <b>and</b> is related with various aging <b>and</b> <b>metabolic</b> diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Furthermore, NF-κB activation with chronic inflammation is connected with many known life span <b>and</b> <b>metabolic</b> regulators including DNA damage, obesity, SIRT, and PARP. Thus, the crossroads between PARP and SIRT signaling pathways represent efficient therapeutic targets for extending health span without metabolic diseases...|$|R

40|$|Personality <b>and</b> <b>metabolic</b> rate are {{predicted}} to show covariance on methodological and functional grounds, but empirical {{studies at the}} individual level are rare, especially in natural populations. Here we assess the relationship between exploration behaviour, an important axis of personality, <b>and</b> basal <b>metabolic</b> rate (BMR) for 680 free-living great tits Parus major, studied over three years. We find that exploration behaviour is weakly negatively related to BMR among female, but not male, birds. Moreover, we find exploration behaviour to be independent of methodological aspects of BMR measurements (e. g. activity levels, time to acclimatize) which have been suggested to be indicative of personality-related activity or stress levels during measurement. This suggests that the weak link between exploration behaviour and BMR found here is functional rather than methodological. We therefore test the hypothesis that selection favours covariance between exploration behaviour <b>and</b> <b>metabolic</b> rate, but find no evidence for correlational survival or fecundity selection. Our data therefore provide at best only very weak evidence for a functional link between personality <b>and</b> <b>metabolic</b> rate, <b>and</b> we suggest that studies of personality <b>and</b> <b>metabolic</b> strategies, or personality and daily energy expenditure, are required to further resolve the link between personality <b>and</b> <b>metabolic</b> rate. ...|$|R
