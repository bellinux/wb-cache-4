500|$|The {{mucilage}} {{produced by}} Drosera has remarkable elastic properties {{and has made}} this genus a very attractive subject in biomaterials research. In one recent study, the adhesive mucilages of three species (D.binata, D.capensis, and D.spatulata) were analyzed for nanofiber and nanoparticle content. [...] Using atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, researchers were able to observe networks of nanofibers and nanoparticles of various sizes within the mucilage residues. In addition, calcium, magnesium, and chlorine – key components of biological salts - were identified. These nanoparticles are theorized to increase the viscosity and stickiness of the mucilage, in turn increasing {{the effectiveness of the}} trap. More importantly for biomaterials research, however, is the fact that, when dried, the mucin provides a suitable substrate for the attachment of living cells. This has important implications for tissue engineering, especially because of the elastic qualities of the adhesive. Essentially, a coating of Drosera mucilage on a <b>surgical</b> <b>implant,</b> such as a replacement hip or an organ transplant, could drastically improve the rate of recovery and decrease the potential for rejection, because living tissue can effectively attach and grow on it. The authors also suggest a wide variety of applications for Drosera mucin, including wound treatment, regenerative medicine, or enhancing synthetic adhesives. Also of note, because this mucilage can stretch to nearly a million times its original size and is readily available for use, it can be an extremely cost-efficient source of biomaterial.|$|E

40|$|Objective To {{determine}} {{the acceptability of}} porcine and bovine <b>surgical</b> <b>implants</b> among persons of Jewish, Muslim, and Hindu faiths whose beliefs prohibit them from consuming porcine and bovine products. Data Sources An evaluation of current literature concerning religious beliefs among persons of Jewish, Muslim, and Hindu faiths was undertaken to determine if animal-derived <b>surgical</b> <b>implants</b> are permitted for use in these religions. Study Selection Because of the limited published literature about this topic, the opinions of religious leaders in Australia were sought. Data Extraction Religious and cultural beliefs can conflict with and limit treatment options, especially in surgery. Approximately 81 porcine and bovine <b>surgical</b> <b>implants</b> are regularly used in Australia. Data Synthesis It is deemed acceptable {{for members of the}} Jewish faith to undergo surgery using porcine products. In dire situations and only after all other options have been exhausted, followers of the Muslim faith are permitted to use porcine surgical products. Hindu religious leaders did not accept the use of bovine <b>surgical</b> <b>implants.</b> Conclusions Australia comprises a multicultural society; therefore, it is necessary to consider religious beliefs of all patients. As part of a surgeon's duty of care, the informed consent process should include a discussion about animal-derived <b>surgical</b> <b>implants</b> to avoid religious distress and possible litigation. A greater understanding of religious views would enhance the medical care of persons of Jewish, Muslim, and Hindu faiths. Catherine Easterbrook and Guy Madder...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Osseointegrable <b>surgical</b> <b>implants</b> {{are usually}} made on {{titanium}} or titanium alloys. The osseointegration process is improved by surface conditioning of these implants, increasing surface area with no loosing of bio-compatibility, i. e., without contamination by non bio-compatible materials. The surface conditioning of these implants might {{be accomplished in}} different ways: blasting, chemical etching, deposition, etc. Two alternatives considering titanium powders are discussed in this work: blasting and plasma spraying deposition.
