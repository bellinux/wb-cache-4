40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} study {{deposited}} sediment <b>settlement</b> and consolidation mechanisms, sediment <b>settlement</b> experiments were conducted using a <b>settlement</b> column. Based on the experimental results, sediment <b>settlement</b> stage definition, excessive pore pressure (EPP) dissipation, and consolidation constitutive equations are discussed. Three stages, including the free <b>settlement,</b> hindered <b>settlement,</b> and self-weight consolidation <b>settlement</b> stages, are defined. The {{results of this}} study show that sediment <b>settlement</b> is mainly affected by the initial sediment concentration and initial <b>settlement</b> height, and the interface <b>settlement</b> rate is linearly attenuated with time on bilogarithmic scales during the hindered <b>settlement</b> and self-weight consolidation <b>settlement</b> stages. Moreover, the deposited sediment layer in the self-weight consolidation <b>settlement</b> stage experiences large strains, and the <b>settlement</b> amount in this stage is about 32 % to 59 % of the initial height of deposited sediment. EPP is nonlinearly distributed in the <b>settlement</b> direction, and consolidation <b>settlement</b> is faster than EPP dissipation in the self-weight consolidation <b>settlement</b> stage. Consolidation constitutive equations for the hydraulic conductivity and effective stress, applicable to large-strain consolidation calculation, were also determined and fitted in the power function form...|$|R

5|$|A broad swathe {{of western}} Chiapas {{was held by}} the Zoques, {{covering}} the Depresión Central, the middle Grijalva basin, the Chimalapas {{and parts of the}} Pacific coastline. The main Zoque <b>settlements</b> in the Depresión Central were Copainalá, Mezcalapa, Quechula and Tecapatán. Their <b>settlements</b> on the western side of the Grijalva River included Citalapa, Jiquipilas, Ocozocuautla and the Corzos valley. Coyatocmó was a small Zoque settlement that grew into the modern state capital, Tuxtla Gutiérrez. The Aztecs exacted tribute from the Zoques, and dominated trade routes running through their territory. In pre-Columbian times, the Depresión Central featured two of the largest cities in the region, Chiapa and Copanaguastla. The area around Chiapa de Corzo was occupied by the Chiapanecas, whose ethnicity and language are unknown. The Chiapanecas were militarily powerful before the Spanish conquest; they had forced a number of important Zoque <b>settlements</b> to pay them tribute, and had successfully resisted being incorporated into the Aztec Empire. The Chiapaneca territory lay between the territories of the Zoques and the Tzotzil Maya, in the upper and middle Grijalva basin; their main <b>settlements</b> were Acala, Chiapa, Ostuta, Pochutla and Suchiapa.|$|E
