500|$|Pope's {{wardrobe}} {{is designed}} by Scandal costume designer Lyn Paolo (known for costume design on The West Wing, ER and Shameless), {{and it has}} {{caught the attention of}} the Vogue staff. In 2014, Washington's portrayal of Pope and her promotion of Pope's style earned her acclaim as a style influencer from the Accessories Council. Paolo attempted to make Pope stand apart from the black, gray and dark blue colors of DC by outfitting her in [...] "chic pastels" [...] {{going so far as to}} put her in pink pants or Louboutin shoes at times. Some of her most respected wardrobe pieces are from notable fashion houses such as Ferragamo, Burberry, Gucci, Armani, Prada, Valentino, Tory Burch, and Michael Kors. The Valentino was saved for the season 1 finale. In addition to the luxurious elements of her wardrobe that are on loan from designers, Pope wears modest elements that Paolo picks up from Nordstrom Rack, Bloomingdale's and Loehmann's. The Pope character has become somewhat of a style icon. Harper's Bazaar and Glamour analyze her wardrobe every week in a dedicated fashion watch columns. Time describes her as [...] "a real-world lifestyle tastemaker", pointing out that the Crate & Barrel wine glasses that she drinks from on the show sold out at the store. Washington and Paolo curated a <b>Saks</b> <b>Fifth</b> Avenue installation of Pope fashions in October 2013. That season, Pope's attire was part of a special collection at <b>Saks</b> <b>Fifth</b> Avenue. In September 2014, an Olivia Pope Scandal collection was set to debut at The Limited, in what was publicized as [...] "the first design collaboration between a national retailer and a top-rated network TV show, its costume designer and star". The collaboration included [...] "tops, pants, jackets and outerwear" [...] and incorporated items priced as low as $49. The collaboration includes 42 pieces. Vulture dedicated a feature to presenting every outfit Pope wore during season 2. When her wardrobe changed to more colorful and asymmetric looks in season 3, The Huffington Post dedicated a feature to this issue. During season 3, Entertainment Weekly ranked Pope's ten best outfits. Because Pope's wardrobe is pricey, there are features and websites dedicated to cheap alternatives to the exact wardrobe elements. Paolo suggests that the Pope style be purchased at Zara and Ann Taylor. In terms of jewelry, Pope wears long necklaces and exclusively wears Movado watches. She also generally uses one of her modest collection of Prada purses.|$|E
