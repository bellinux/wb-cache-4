Para que sejam eficazes, os testes para a avaliação da {{performance}} e determinação de índices para prescrição das intensidades do treinamento devem ser válidos, confiáveis e específicos. Contudo, a simulação do movimento de patinação em ambiente laboratorial é cara e difícil de ser realizada, enquanto que a avaliação em ambiente externo dificulta o controle do protocolo e a mensuração das variáveis necessárias. A prescrição do exercício de patinação a partir de índices advindos de testes em cicloergômetro ou esteira de corrida não é apropriada. Objetivos. Investigar a reprodutibilidade e validade de dois protocolos incrementais máximos de patinação em {{slide board}} (SB) para determinar os índices fisiológicos aeróbios máximos e submáximos em patinadores. Método. Dez patinadores realizaram duas vezes (teste e reteste) um teste incremental máximo "curto" em SB, que teve início a uma cadência de 30 passos por minuto (ppm), aumentando três ppm a cada minuto. O mesmo grupo realizou um protocolo incremental em cicloergômetro com incremento de cadência. Um segundo grupo de dez patinadores realizou um teste incremental máximo "longo" em SB, iniciando a 30 ppm, com incremento de três ppm a cada três minutos. Este grupo realizou também o protocolo curto em SB e um protocolo concorrente em cicloergômetro com incremento de carga. Os patinadores foram classificados em dois grupos, de acordo com as características do treinamento: "competitivos" (treinamento estruturado acima de 6 horas semanais) e "recreacionais" (patinação livre de até 4 horas semanais). Os valores máximos e submáximos, relacionados ao ponto de deflexão da frequência cardíaca (PDFC), de consumo de oxigênio (VO 2), ventilação (VE), troca respiratória (RER), frequência cardíaca (FC), percepção subjetiva de esforço (PSE), cadência (CAD), potência (P) e concentração de lactato ([Lac]), bem como o índice de rítmo (%R) no teste foram determinados. Para análise de reprodutibilidade e validade foram utilizados: o teste t de Student, o teste de correlação intraclasse (ICC), o erro típico de medida (ETM), o coeficiente de correlação de Pearson e os limites de concordância (95 %LC). Os coeficientes das retas de regressão individuais da FC, VO 2 e [Lac] foram comparados. Foi realizada uma análise de regressão múltipla para previsão do VO 2 max, utilizando o método de seleção stepwise. Resultados. Não foram encontradas diferenças significativas entre as variáveis durante o teste e o reteste em SB. Uma boareprodutibilidade absoluta (ICC > 0, 9) e relativa (ETM Abstract: Introduction. To be effective, the performance evaluations for exercise prescription must be valid, reliable and movement-specific. However, a specific laboratory skating assessments are expensive {{and difficult to}} simulate in the laboratory, while field tests are difficult to precisely control the protocol and to acquire the physiological data needed. Frequently, the exercise prescription for skaters is based on indices obtained from cycling or running treadmill incremental tests, despite {{it does not seem}} suitable. Purpose. This study intended to assess {{the reliability and validity of}} two incremental slide board (SB) skating tests to determine aerobic indices of performance in skaters. Method. Ten skaters perfomed twice (test and retest) a "short" SB maximal incremental test, wich started with 30 push-offs per minute (ppm), increasing three ppm each minute. The same group performed a concurrent incremental cadence cycling test. A second group of ten skaters performed a "long" SB maximal incremental protocol, wich started with 30 ppm, increasing three ppm each three minutes. This group performed also the short SB protocol and a concurrent incremental load cycle testing. The participants were classified in two groups, according to the training characteristics: "competitives" (training program over 6 hour per week) and "recreationals" (free skating lower than 4 hours per week). Maximal and submaximal values associated to the heart rate deflection point (HRDP) of oxygen uptake (VO 2), pulmonary ventilation (VE), respiratory exchange (RER), heart rate (HR), rating of perceived effort (RPE), cadence (CAD), power output (P) and blood lactate concentration ([Lac]max), as well as the rhythm index (%R) during the tests were measured. To determine the reliability and validity the follow statitiscal analisys were used: t test, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), typical error of measure (TEM), Pearson's coefficient and 95 % of the limits of agreement (95 % LA). The indivídual linear regression equations of HR, VO 2 and [Lac] were determined, and the slopes of the regression lines were compared. Multiple regression analysis was performed to predict VO 2 max, and the stepwise method was used to select the independent variables. Results: No significant differences between test-retest on SB were found for all variables. High relative (ICC > 0. 9) and absolute reliability (TEM < 3. 5 %) were found for VO 2 max, HRmax, CADmax, CADPDFC, and RPEPDFC. High correlations were found for FCmax, CADmax,CADrelmax, CADPDFC, CADrelPDFC, VO 2 max and VO 2 PDFC for <b>SB</b> <b>long</b> protocol. In comparison to SB test, the [Lac]max was significantly higher and RPEAT was lower during cycling protocol. High correlations were found for Pmax, FCmax, FCOBLA, VO 2 OBLA, VO 2 max, VEmax, INTOBLA, POBLA and [Lac]OBLA between SB and cycle ergometer long protocols. REROBLA, VO 2 OBLA, and VEmax didn't show differences. The slope of the regression lines of HR, VO 2 and [Lac] weren't different among protocols. Significant correlations were found for most maximal variables and for submaximal HR between short and <b>long</b> <b>SB</b> protocols. CADmax explained around 50 % of VO 2 max obtained during short SB protocol, and %R was strongly correlated with CADmax. The "competitive" group had higher VO 2 max, CADmax, Pmax, Pmaxrel, VO 2 LV 2, PrelLV 2 and %R compared with the recreacional group. Conclusions: The findings suggest that the short SB test is reliable and valid to evaluate maximal and submaximal physiological indices associated with aerobic performance of skaters. The <b>long</b> <b>SB</b> protocol elicited physiological responses similar and correlated with the ones found on cycle ergometer, pointing out to the valididty of the SB test to adequately measure aerobic indices. However, the differences found in some absolute values of some variables reflect the physiological particularity of the skating laboratory tests and the inapropriated use of cycle ergometer tests to evaluate skaters...|$|R

The scanning and transmission electron microscopy and X-ray scattering were used for determination {{of the size of}} LDPE particles and the localization and structure of SB copolymers in blends. It is shown that the dependence of the LDPE particle size on the amount of added SB and localization of SB copolymers in blends is predominantly controlled by the length of their Styrene blocks. It follows from thermodynamic considerations that the reason is the difference in composition asymmetry between SB with short and long styrene blocks. Coalescence of particles of SB having short styrene blocks at the surface of LDPE droplets and movement of <b>SB</b> with <b>long</b> styrene blocks to the PS-LDPE interface were observed during annealing of PS/LDPE/SB blends. Pronounced migration of SB copolymer during annealing shows that their localizations in blends in steady state on long steady mixing and at thermodvnamic equilibrium are different. The values of tensile impact strength of PS/LDPE/SB blends correlate well with the size of LDPE particles and the amount of SB at the interface. Viscosity of BS/LDPE/SB depends on molecular structure of SB copolymers by a manner different from that of tensile impact strength. The results of this Study and literature data lead {{to the conclusion that the}} compatibilization efficiency of SB copolymers for a certain polystyrenepolyolefin pair is a function of not only molecular parameters of SB but also of the polystyrene/polyolefin ratio, the amount of SB in a blend, and mixing and processing conditions.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} whether the application of superphosphate fertiliser to soils contaminated with mine wastes can inhibit metal and metalloid mobility (Cu, Pb, Zn, Cd, Fe, Mn, As, <b>Sb)</b> in the <b>long</b> term. Contaminated soils contained sulfide- and sulfate-rich waste materials from the Broken Hill and Mt Isa mining centres. Results of long-term (10 months) column experiments demonstrate that fertiliser amendment had highly variable effects on the degree of metal and metalloid mobilisation and capture. Rapid release of metals from a sulfate-rich soil showed that phosphate amendment was ineffective in stabilising highly soluble metal-bearing phases. In a sulfide-rich soil with abundant organic matter, complexing of metals with soluble organic acids led to pronounced metal (mainly Cd, Cu and Zn) release from fertiliser-amended soils. The abundance of pyrite, as well as the addition of fertiliser, caused persistent acid production over time, which prevented the formation of insoluble metal phosphate phases and instead fostered an increased mobility of both metals and metalloids (As, Cd, Cu, Sb, Zn). By contrast, fertiliser application to a sulfide-rich soil with low organic carbon content and a sufficient acid buffering capacity to maintain near-neutral pH resulted in the immobilisation of Pb in the form of newly precipitated Pb phosphate phases. Thus, phosphate stabilisation was ineffective in suppressing metal and metalloid mobility from soils that were rich in organic matter, contained abundant pyrite and had a low acid buffering capacity. Phosphate stabilisation appears to be more effective for the in situ treatment of sulfide-rich soils that are distinctly enriched in Pb and contain insignificant concentrations of organic matter and other metals and metalloids...|$|R

Chemical analysis of the leachate and column solids, optical mineralogy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, electron probe microanalysis, microscale X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy, Bureau Commun de RÃ©fÃ©rence sequential extraction and water-soluble chemical extractions, and speciation modelling have shown that the weathering of As-bearing pyrite and arsenopyrite, resulted in a loss of 13 - 29 % of the original mass of As. By contrast, Pb and Sb showed much lower mass losses (0. 1 - 1. 1 % and 0. 6 - 1. 9 %, respectively) due to the formation of insoluble Pb-and Sb(V) -rich phases, which were stable at the low pH (~ 2) conditions that prevailed {{by the end of the}} experiment. The experiment also demonstrated a link between the cycling of As, Sb, and the oxidation of Fe(II) -bearing sphalerite, which acted as a nucleation point for an Fe-As-Sb-O phase. Phosphorus was relatively immobile in the tailings columns (up to 0. 3 % mass loss) but was more mobile in the soil-bearing columns (up to 10 % mass loss), due to the formation of soluble P-bearing minerals or mobilization by organic matter.

Ghent University Hospital, Belgium and Cliniques Universitaires St. Luc, Brussels, Belgium. Background: The ERC 2000 Guidelines recommend tidal volumes (Vt) of only 400 - 600 ml and inspiratory times (Ti) between one and two seconds to reduce gastric insufflation (GI) with Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM) devices (1). Studies {{have shown that the}} SMART BAG® (SB, O-Two Medical Technologies Inc. Canada) reduces GI by the use of a pressure/flow responsive valve (2, 3). Purpose: 1. 	To assess ventilation skills of emergency department (ED) nurses with a Standard BVM (STBVM) and the SB before and after CPR training focusing on limiting Vt and prolonging Ti. We hypothesized that after 3 and 6 months the SB would facilitate the maintenance of good quality ventilation. 2. 	To identify ventilation parameters associated with GI. Materials and methods We utilized a CPR training manikin (Simulaids, USA) equipped with an oesophagus and a PEEP valve set at 20 cm H 20 simulating the lower oesophageal sphincter pressure. Ti, Vt and peak pressure (Pp) were measured (CPRview®, Michigan Instruments, USA). GI was measured with a volume meter (Medishield, UK). Prior to training, 39 ED nurses performed CPR for 2 minutes, in pairs, using a STBVM (Laerdal, Norway) to assess their baseline skills. Immediately following training they were retested using an O-Two STBVM and a SB. Twenty nurses were retested after 3 months, 19 after 6 months. Efficient ventilation was defined as a mean Vt > 400 ml and GI 400 ml, cases without GI had longer Ti and lower Pp than cases with GI (Ti 1. 29 s versus 1. 00 s, p= 0. 003, Pp 17 cm H 20 versus 8 cm H 20, p 400 ml had even longer Ti (1. 47 s) and lower Pp (7. 5 cm H 20) than STBVM cases. Of all efficient ventilations with a STBVM, 11 / 37 (30 %) had Vt > 600 ml Conclusions: 1. 	Skills assessment: a. 	Ventilation techniques at base line were poor with GI and hypoventilation as the major problems, justifying training. b. 	After training, only 47 % of nurses ventilated efficiently, mainly because of hypoventilation. c. 	In contrast with STBVM, SB resulted in better skills after 6 months compared with base line. 2. 	Ventilation parameters: a. 	Short Ti and high Pp are associated with GI in the STBVM. b. 	The SB achieved good volumes at the longest Ti and lowest Pp. There was never GI with the <b>SB.</b> c. 	<b>Long</b> Ti and reduced Pp prevented GI with STBVM even at Vt > 600 ml. d. 	Training should focus on prolonging Ti and not only on limiting Vt.
