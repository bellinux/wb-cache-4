5|$|In a genome wide {{association}} screen (GWAS), CASS4 <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> {{correlation with}} clinical pathological features of AD such as neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques. Two additional CASS4 SNPs {{were reported to}} be associated with AD susceptibility: rs6024870, and rs16979934 T/G. Given the likely conserved CAS-family cytoskeletal function of CASS4, it has been speculated that it may have a role in axonal transport and influence the expression of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and tau, which are pathologically affected in AD. Several possible mechanisms for CASS4 action in AD have been proposed.|$|E
5|$|The first tests using {{electric}} detonators and solid pits {{were performed on}} 7 and 14 February 1945; until then primacord-based initiation was employed. The {{electric detonators}} <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> improvement in the achieved compression degree and symmetry, and were used on all RaLa tests thereafter. Based on these results, {{by the end of}} February the design of the gadget, as the bomb was euphemistically known, was settled. Other test methods were also necessary, as the RaLa experiments provided only indirect indications about the formation of problematic jets that plagued the early implosion designs, but RaLa was the most important.|$|E

25|$|To better {{elucidate}} {{the findings of}} thought suppression, several studies have changed the target thought.

Furthermore, Wenzlaff, Wegner, & Roper demonstrated that anxious or depressed subjects {{were less likely to}} suppress negative, unwanted thoughts. Despite Rassin, Merkelbach and Muris reporting that this finding is moderately robust in the literature, some studies were unable to replicate results. However, this may be explained by a consideration of individual differences.|$|E

25|$|While {{music therapy}} {{has been used}} for many years, up until the mid-1980s little {{empirical}} research had been done to support the efficacy of the treatment. Since then, more research has focused on determining both the effectiveness and the underlying physiological mechanisms leading to symptom improvement. For example, one meta-study covering 177 patients (over 9 studies) <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> effect on many negative symptoms of psychopathologies, particularly in developmental and behavioral disorders. Music therapy was especially effective in improving focus and attention, and in decreasing negative symptoms like anxiety and isolation.|$|E
25|$|Most European {{countries}} (except UK) did not conduct {{very complex}} and expensive {{studies on the}} effectiveness of respirators in the workplaces, or spent very little of such research. Therefore, it may be that some countries do not take full account of results of foreign researches (that <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> difference between the effectiveness of respirators in a laboratory environment; and in applying them in the workplaces). For example, after the study in 1990, the APF value of negative pressure full face masks was reduced from 900 to 40 (1997) in UK. But in other countries, similar research was not carried out; and a similar decrease did not occur.|$|E

25|$|In Ghana, a {{study that}} {{combined}} the sanitation and fungicide application <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> reduction {{in the percentage of}} disease incidence, where greater black pod incident were observed from pods on the trunk than the canopy in control treatment (no fungicide application). This suggested that the application of fungicide on the trunk would protect pods from infection, therefore reduce primary and secondary infection rate, both on the trunk and in the canopy. In addition, the application of systemic (potassium phosphonate) with one and double injection (20 ml and 40 ml of fungicide for each injection frequency), and semi-systemic (metalaxyl) fungicide showed better control compared to contact fungicides (copper based fungicide) in both locations that were used in the experiment.|$|E
25|$|A {{study of}} {{norepinephrine}} levels in gamblers found high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) {{levels of the}} norepinephrine (NE) metabolite 3-methoq-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MI-IPG). This could suggest {{a relationship between the}} noradrenergic system and gambling, and gambling could be seen as a reward-dependent behavior, but according to Cloninger’s theory these gamblers should exhibit low levels of NE, not high. Cloninger suggests that had these gamblers been retested after they had refrained from gambling for a determined period, their CSF MHPG levels might have been low. A study of norepinephrine levels in alcoholics with high reward dependence also <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> decrease of MHPG in their CSF. This finding demonstrates a significant relationship between reward dependence and norepinephrine.|$|E
25|$|Prostate {{enlargement}} {{can cause}} difficulties emptying the bladder completely. This situation, {{in which there}} is residual volume in the bladder is prone to complications such as cystitis and bladder stones, also commonly found in patients with benign prostate hyperplasia. It was often suggested to change the voiding position of symptomatic males, however study results showed heterogeneity. A meta-analysis of people with prostate enlargement and healthy males <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> reduction of residual volume, while a trend towards an improved urinary flow rate and decreased voiding time was found. The effect of changing ones position is thought to arise from relaxation of the pelvic musculature, which are contracted in the standing position thereby influencing urodynamics.|$|E

25|$|While polling <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> {{increase}} in government satisfaction and high approval ratings for Marshall, the Progressive Conservative Party {{was unable to}} regain the support it had lost during Dunderdale's tenure as premier. A CRA poll conducted throughout August 2014, showed that 62 {{percent of those polled}} were satisfied with the government's performance under Marshall. This number was consistent with other polls conducted by CRA during Marshall's time as premier. An Angus Reid Global poll ranking the popularity of Canadian premiers placed Marshall as the third most popular premier in the country, with a 59 percent approval rating. CRA placed support for the PC Party at 33 percent in February 2014—a four-point increase since November 2013—but support fell over the next two quarters. The party's support fell to 29 percent in May and fell again to 26 percent in August.|$|E
25|$|Like the chondroitin sulfate {{proteoglycan}}s, keratan sulfate proteoglycan (KSPG) {{production is}} up regulated in reactive astrocytes {{as part of}} glial scar formation. KSPGs have {{also been shown to}} inhibit neurite outgrowth extension, limiting nerve regeneration. Keratan sulfate, also called keratosulfate, is formed from repeating disaccharide galactose units and N-acetylglucosamines. It is also 6-sulfated. This sulfation is crucial to the elongation of the keratan sulfate chain. A study was done using N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 deficient mice. The wild type mouse <b>showed</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> up regulation of mRNA expressing N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 at the site of cortical injury. However, in the N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 deficient mice, the expression of keratan sulfate was significantly decreased when compared to the wild type mice. Similarly, glial scar formation was significantly reduced in the N-acetylglucosamine 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 mice, and as a result, nerve regeneration was less inhibited.|$|E
