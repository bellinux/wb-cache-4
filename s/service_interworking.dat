40|$|This paper {{examines}} current {{approaches to}} signalling and <b>service</b> <b>interworking</b> between Internet and {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN). It notes that until now convergence {{between the two}} networks has for the most part taken place in the transport and signalling layers. Signalling interworking architectures cater for the specific class of telephony-like services and although they can accommodate the extension of the intelligent network's (IN) realm of control in the Internet, they do not provide a generic platform for <b>service</b> <b>interworking.</b> Through the adoption of the Parlay APIs, a way is foreseen for (a) consolidation of telephone service over both Internet and PSTN through the imposition of a uniform call control API while allowing the installed IN infrastructure to be used also for Internet telephony services and (b) for <b>service</b> <b>interworking</b> between telephony-like services and open distributed services in the Internet. The paper proposes a service architecture that {{can be used as a}} platform for Parlay-based <b>service</b> <b>interworking</b> while offsetting some drawbacks that the Parlay approach incurs.

40|$|Abstract. An {{interworking}} translator for IPv 6 and IPv 4 {{services can}} be defined as an intermediate component between a native IPv 4 host and a native IPv 6 host to enable direct communication between them without requiring any modi-fications to the hosts. But if the host is a mobile node, triangle routing problem occurs, since Mobile IPv 4 allows mobile node to roam transparently in any network. In this situation, mobile node must notify transfer information to its own home agent and correspondent node in IPv 6 network. But current NAT-PT does not permit mobility header translation. Therefore, NAT-PT does not sup-port efficient communication between Mobile IPv 4 and Mobile IPv 6. In this paper, we propose a mobility <b>service</b> <b>interworking</b> mechanism for heterogene-ous mobile network environments. 1...|$|E
40|$|The current {{generation}} of optical networks based on a fixed wavelength grid and on fixed-rate transponders would impose relevant limitations for future transmission rates exceeding 100 Gb/s, thereby {{limiting the number of}} potential implementations and making a new generation of elastic optical networks (EON) necessary. To this regard, flexible-grid (Flexgrid) transmission and switching technologies could significantly increase both transport network scalability and flexibility. Further benefits would come from multilayer interworking mechanisms enabling direct control of bandwidth-variable transponders (BVT) based on electronic switching technologies (IP/MPLS, OTN, etc.) for optical bandwidth optimization purposes.

40|$|Virtual Private Networks (VPN) are {{a popular}} way for {{enterprises}} to interconnect remote sites. Traditionally, VPNs {{have been based}} on Frame Relay, Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or Time Division Multiplex (TDM) private lines, using the service provider’s ATM core network, and accounting for the majority of their data service revenues. However, the influences of a highly dynamic telecommunications market have raised demands for increased flexibility while controlling costs. New revenue opportunities are emerging for service providers to differentiate their offerings through services such as IP VPNs and the Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS), while achieving operational efficiencies though convergence of all services on a common MPLS backbone. However, existing technologies, such as ATM, provide highly profitable services which must continue to be supported. The authors describe how network and <b>service</b> <b>interworking</b> can help to deliver profitable services over the new converged network.

40|$|The {{wireless}} access networks are very diverse. While standardization is {{more appropriate for}} systems serving similar purposes, different standards may continue to serve different needs. It is impractical trying to arrive at one single one-size-fit-all global standard of wireless system in the foreseeable future. Instead, interworking technologies are needed to complement the standardization efforts. For example, the IEEE 802. 11 family of WirelessLAN (WLAN) and the Wireless Data Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) have different capabilities in distance range, data rate, and in other features, and may complement each other. Combining WLAN and PLMN Wireless data through interworking will enable these LAN and WAN technologies to complement each other to enhance the available wireless network <b>services.</b> <b>Interworking</b> technology is defined here as the enabling technologies such that any customer of any service provider may run any communication application on any wireless communication device to communicate with any other customers...|$|R

Ensuring that threats to the interconnected communications systems and terminals are sufficiently and appropriately reduced by technical, procedural and environmental countermeasures is vital to realise the trusted and secure communication system needed for the pursued PPDR transnational cooperation activities. In this context, ISITEP Work Package 2. 2 (WP 2. 2) “Security Requirements” is aimed at establishing the set of security requirements needed to drive {{the development of the}} security architecture and its components. This first deliverable from WP 2. 2 provides a description of the preliminary framework and methodology defined to carry out the development of the security requirements. The framework includes aspects such as the identification of the ISITEP system components and players that are relevant for the security analysis, and the definition of security objectives. On this basis, the document also conducts a first assessment to delineate the state-of-the-art of the security features existing in current PPDR technologies and networks, security procedures carried out by PPDR end-users and operators in order to realise the trusted and secure communication system needed in national PPDR networks, and to provide an overview of the regulatory and legislation framework that impacts affects PPDR communication networks.

40|$|Triggered by the {{deregulation}} of the telecommunications market, {{it is expected that}} the number of services deployed in the telecommunications network will increase dramatically in the near future. It is expected that these <b>services</b> will be <b>interworking.</b> However, as widely reported, <b>interworking</b> <b>services</b> will be subject to the service interaction problem. It is essential to cope with the problem in a developing multi service provider environment as it may substantially delay service deployment and hence form a serious obstacle to rapid service provisioning. In order to cope with the increasing number of services deployed in the network, previous work suggested the application of filtering approaches. This paper suggests such a technique. It is pragmatic in nature and does not require detailed service knowledge. Furthermore, it is shown how the approach can be incorporated into an overall comprehensive service interaction management process. Even though the approach is applied to call control aspects only, it could be extended to cover other areas...|$|R

40|$|The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) {{is widely}} used as a call control {{protocol}} for Voice over IP (VoIP), and indeed commercial implementations are readily available off-the-shelf. SIP supports flexible service provisioning not only through third parties, but also end-users. Laboratory experience shows that as these <b>services</b> are <b>interworking</b> {{they are subject to}} the feature interaction problem. Feature interactions may considerably delay service deployment and hence are a threat to rapid service provisioning. This paper investigates the feature interaction problem in SIP-based services and investigates the application of a pragmatic approach. This runtime approach does not require any detailed information about the services and hence can be applied in a competitive market. Furthermore, the technique is particularly strong in handling interactions between distributed services – a key characteristic of SIP-based services. Moreover, the approach is fully distributed without any centralised components, and includes detection and resolution of feature interactions. Ó 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

The LTE-EPS network (Long Term Evolution - Evolved Packet Core) offers high bandwidth, low latency and improved spectrum efficiency. It provides IP connectivity but does not support valuable legacy services such as the SMS (Short Message Service) in Release 8 to 10. 3 GPP is currently specifying two architectures for SMS transmission over LTE in Release 11.

Two complementary scenarios are proposed by 3 GPP, {{depending on the type}} of LTE device used.

40|$|The key to {{introducing}} CORBA-based object-oriented {{technologies in}} the real-time telecommunications signaling environment {{is to ensure}} interoperability by maintaining the existing, standard protocols using Signaling System No. 7 (SS 7) for the external communication interface between telecommunication equipment.

MESIS permits the design and the implementation of new services for open, global, and untrusted scenarios, such as the Internet. The principal part of MESIS is a distributed processing environment composed of a wide set of facilities that can be exploited for building services at the application layer.
