The aim of {{land use}} planning is to create livable, accessible and well connected communities and to support the development and growth of new settlement and industry. By better integrating land use and infrastructure planning, it can be ensured that new development makes use of under capacity in existing infrastructure, rather than creating demand for new infrastructure in un-serviced areas. Linking settlement and infrastructure investment strategies will allow land use to better integrate with infrastructure planning, to ensure that commercial, industrial and residential areas make better use of existing infrastructure, and reduce demand for new, expanded and expensive infrastructure. The basic approach {{of this research is}} to develop suitable proposal to control the haphazard development through development control regulation of different zone, identification of developable area to provide good environment and livelihood in this area for healthy living and strategy and guideline for proposed development. Proposed study area is extended over an area 16. 60 sq km, bounded by Barrackpur-Barasat Road in the North, Dum-Dum Barrackpur Express way in west, Selarhat, Jalsukha, Saibana and Jamtagar mouzas in the east & Sodepur-Barasat Road in the south under South- 24 Parganas, West Bengal, India.
