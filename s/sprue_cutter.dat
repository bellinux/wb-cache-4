Fabrication processes model makers take part in are powder coating, shearing, punching, plating, folding, forming and anodizing. Some model makers also use increasingly automated processes, for example cutting parts directly with digital data from computer-aided design plans on a CNC mill or creating the parts through rapid prototyping.
