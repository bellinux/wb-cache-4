40|$|The {{transition}} {{process from}} a diffuser rotating stall to a stage stall in a centrifugal compressor with a vaned diffuser was investigated by experimental and numerical analyses. From the velocity measurements, {{it was found}} that the rotating stall existed on the <b>shroud</b> <b>side</b> of the diffuser passage in the off-design flow condition. The numerical results revealed the typical vortical structure of the diffuser stall. The diffuser stall cell was caused by the systematic vortical structure which consisted of the tornado-type vortex, the longitudinal vortex at the shroud/suction surface corner (i. e., leading edge vortex (LEV)), and the vortex in the throat area of the diffuser passages. Furthermore, the stage stall, which rotated within both the impeller and diffuser passages, occurred instead of the diffuser stall as the mass flow rate was decreased. According to the velocity measurements at the diffuser inlet, the diffuser stall which rotated on the <b>shroud</b> <b>side</b> was shifted to the hub side. Then, the diffuser stall moved into the impeller passages and formed the stage stall. Therefore, the stage stall was caused by the development of the diffuser stall, which transferred from the <b>shroud</b> <b>side</b> to the hub side in the vaneless space and expanded to the impeller passages...|$|R

These flows result {{in the formation of}} regions of low velocity near the intersection of blade suction <b>side</b> and <b>shroud.</b> The extent of this jet-wake structure decreases with increasing flow rate. Velocity fields have also been computed from Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations with the Spalart–Allmaras turbulence model using a commercial CFD code. For the considered flow rates, the qualitative agreement between measured and computed velocity profiles is very good. Overall, the average relative difference between these velocity profiles is around 5 %. Additional CFD computations have been performed to assess the influence of Reynolds number and the shape of the inlet velocity profile on the computed velocity fields.

40|$|This shroud {{provides}} a deep-space simulating environment for testing scaled-down models of passively cooling systems for spaceflight optics and instruments. It is used inside a liquid-nitrogen- cooled vacuum chamber, {{and it is}} cooled by liquid helium to 5 K. It has an inside geometry of approximately 1. 6 m diameter by 0. 45 m tall. The inside surfaces of its top and sidewalls have a thermal absorptivity greater than 0. 96. The bottom wall has a large central opening that is easily customized to allow a specific test item to extend through it. This enables testing of scale models of realistic passive cooling configurations that feature a very large temperature drop between the deepspace-facing cooled side and the Sun/Earth-facing warm <b>side.</b> This <b>shroud</b> has an innovative thermal closeout of the bottom wall, so that a test sample can have a hot (room temperature) side outside of the shroud, and a cold <b>side</b> inside the <b>shroud.</b> The combination of this closeout and the very black walls keeps radiated heat from the sample s warm end from entering the shroud, reflecting off the walls and heating the sample s cold end. The shroud includes 12 vertical rectangular sheet-copper side panels that are oriented in a circular pattern. Using tabs bent off from their edges, these side panels are bolted {{to each other and}} to a steel support ring on which they rest. The removable shroud top is a large copper sheet that rests on, and is bolted to, the support ring when the shroud is closed. The support ring stands on four fiberglass tube legs, which isolate it thermally from the vacuum chamber bottom. The insides of the cooper top and side panels are completely covered with 25 - mm-thick aluminum honeycomb panels. This honeycomb is painted black before it is epoxied to the copper surfaces. A spiral-shaped copper tube, clamped at many different locations to the outside of the top copper plate, serves as part of the liquid helium cooling loop. Another copper tube, plumbed in a series to the top plate s tube, is clamped to the sidewall tabs where they are bolted to the support ring. Flowing liquid helium through these tubes cools the entire shroud to 5 K. The entire shroud is wrapped loosely in a layer of double-aluminized Kapton. The support ring s inner diameter is the largest possible hole through which the test item can extend into the shroud. Twelve custom-sized trapezoidal copper sheets extend inward from the support ring to within a few millimeters of the test item. Attached to the inner edge of each of these sheets is a custom-shaped strip of Kapton, which is aluminum- coated on the warm-facing (outer) side, and has thin Dacron netting attached to its cold-facing side. This Kapton rests against the test item, but the Dacron keeps it from making significant thermal contact. The result is a non-contact, radiatively reflective thermal closeout with essentially no gap through which radiation can pass. In this way, the part of the test item outside the shroud can be heated to relatively high temperatures without any radiative heat leaking to the inside...|$|R

40|$|A flow {{straightener}} has {{been incorporated into}} a rotary liquid separator that originally comprised an inlet tube, a shroud plate, an impeller, an inner drum, an outer drum, a housing, a pitot tube, and a hollow shaft motor.

These vanes compartmentalize the inside of the inner drum {{in such a way as}} to break up the flow path and thereby stop the air from swirling; as a result, the air enters the hollow shaft with a predominantly axial velocity instead of a swirl. Tests of the rotary liquid separator at an airflow rate of 10 cu ft/min (0. 0047 cu m/s) revealed that the dynamic pressure drop was 8 in. of water (approx. = 2 kPa) in the absence of the flow straightener and was reduced to 1 in. of water (approx. = 0. 25 kPa) in the presence of the flow straightener...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Based on {{experimental}} {{measurements and}} flow dynamics analysis, themechanism of flow separations in the pump flow {{has been investigated}} and revealed. The possible flow separation including the rotating stall in the vaned diffuser under the normal flow condition has been confirmed to be merely a diffuser effect and caused by the oversized expansion angle of the diffuser. The dynamics of the part load flow separation of both the stationary and the non-stationary character has been identified {{to be related to}} the induced flow circulation at the impeller inlet. The associated flow separation mechanism has been revealed with respect to the build-up of a flow dynamical barrier on the <b>shroud</b> <b>side</b> of the impeller. It exactly explains the coincidence of the flow separation at the impeller inlet and that at the impeller outlet. To quantify the onset of the flow separation, a hypothesis is established based on the revealed mechanism. This has been satisfactorily validated by tests with flow visualizations, pressure measurements and laser doppler anemometry applications. The method for stability control of the pump flows with effective suppression of the flow separation has also been presented...|$|R

The small grooves were set up at the root and/or tip near {{the leading edge of the}} LSD blade. In order to clarify the mechanism of noise increase due to LSD and also to reduce the noise, the relationships between the noise increase based on the LSD, the LSD performance and the secondary flow formed additionally by the tip-groove were investigated experimentally as well as numerically, especially analyzing flow behaviors in the LSD in view points of flow separation on the suction surface of the LSD blade and the secondary flow on the side walls. By reducing the stagnation region smaller near the root and/or tip of the LSD blade leading edge, the secondary flow behavior changes remarkably around the LSD blade, as a result, the noise level and the blower characteristics vary. It can be concluded that, by means of a small tip-groove located only at the <b>shroud</b> <b>side</b> near the LSD blade leading edge, the noise generated by the LSD can be reduced without deteriorations of the LSD performance and the blower characteristics as well...|$|R

40|$|Installation of a {{horizontal}} air-blocking shelf around the inside {{perimeter of the}} surface mining drill deck shroud is proposed to improve dust capture. Without {{the use of this}} shelf, a strong Coand? effect airflow pattern results in dust leakage to the environment, especially at the shroud-to-ground interface. Bailing air exits the drill hole and travels along the drill steel to the underside of the table, where it fans out across the bottom of the drill table and continues down the <b>sides</b> of the <b>shroud.</b> This dust-laden bailing air then strikes the ground and fans out under gaps between the shroud and the ground.

The present study refers to new experiments combining pressure measurements and 2 D/ 3 C High Speed PIV at partial flow rates within a vaneless diffuser with a large outlet radius. Four Brüel & Kjaer condenser microphones are used for the unsteady pressure measurements. They were flush mounted on the <b>shroud</b> <b>side</b> of the diffuser wall and on the suction pipe of the pump. The sampling frequency was 2048 Hz. For PIV measurements, the laser sheet was generated by a Darwin PIV ND:YLF Laser at three heights within the diffuser. PIV snapshots have been recorded by two identical CMOS cameras. A home made software has been used for the images treatment. The results consist in fields of 80 x 120 mm 2 and 81 x 125 velocity vectors with a temporal resolution of 250 velocity maps per second. For each flow rate and each laser sheet height in the diffuser, two acquisitions of about 1500 velocity maps have been realised. The experimental data are compared with the ones provided by a 1 D transient model of the flow within the diffuser...|$|R
30|$|To {{design and}} {{optimize}} the blade shape, {{the distribution of}} the structural parameters, for instance the blade angles, were directly adjusted in previous studies [2 – 4]. Unfortunately, this approach is highly dependent on the designers’ experiences. Additionally, a fair number of design parameters would need to be selected to be optimized {{in order to get a}} new runner blade that is quite different from the target. Instead of geometrically optimizing the blade with blade angles, an important inverse design method was proposed by Borges [5] to design a blade under incompressible conditions, which was subsequently extended to compressible conditions by Zangeneh [6, 7]. In this inverse design approach, the blade shape was represented as sheets of blade loading with the approximate distribution controlled by specific variables at the hub and <b>shroud</b> <b>sides,</b> such a design method has already been adopted in the TURBODesign software. Using this sequential design method in the software, several optimal pumps have been successfully obtained [8, 9]. However, some problems still remain waiting to be solved. First, the blade shape is simply controlled by two cross sections, namely, the hub section and the shroud section, and this so-called 2 D blade profile can only configure a blade with straight leading edge instead of a complex bend leading edge. Nevertheless, the leading edge affects the cavitation and secondary flows [10], thus a design method which can present a complex leading edge would offer extra choices for improving the flow characteristics. Moreover, the ranges for the design variables are not clearly defined. Taking the design method in the TURBODesign software as an example, seven independent variables [8, 9], namely, NCs, NCh, NDs, NDh, SLOPEh, SLOPEs, LEh and LEs, are adopted, and without obvious definition for the range of these variables, a large number of samples would have to be generated before optimization, which would require a considerable amount of time and computing resource.|$|R
