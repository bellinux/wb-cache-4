40|$|Nootka is an {{historical}} fur-trading centre in Yuquot, {{on the west}} coast of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. In 1788, the Spanish king Charles III sent an expedition to Nootka commanded by Ignacio Arteaga (1731 - 1783). A year later, Spain established a military post, San Lorenzo de Nutka, at Yuquot in 1789 which existed until 1795. The missionaries who arrived with the sailors were urged to learn the vernacular languages in order to evangelize. In chapter 5 of the Relación de la entrada deSan Lorenzo de Nutka, the author copies a short vocabulary Spanish-Nutkeño (115 words) made by friar Lorenzo <b>Socies</b> (?-?) and another short vocabulary Spanish-Sandwich (more than 200 words) compiled by the same friar {{with the help of a}} Hawaiian boy, who had been under British Captain James Colnett’s (1753 - 1806) command but had joined the Spanish sailors during the British-Spanish dispute over Nootka.

40|$|A {{new series}} of deep blue/blue {{emitting}} co-polymers are reported. Poly(9, 9 -dihexylfluorene- 3, 6 -diyl and 2, 7 -diyl-co- 2, 8 -dihexyldibenzothiophene-S,S-dioxide- 3, 7 -diyl) derivatives p(F-S) of varying composition have been synthesised. The effects of two different S derivatives with dialkoxy sidechains, the F : S monomer feed ratio, and meta versus para conjugation {{with respect to the}} F units have all been investigated in terms of photophysics and polymer light-emitting diode (PLED) device performance in the architecture ITO/PEDOT:PSS/polymer/TPBi/LiF/Al. The meta polymers poly(9, 9 -dihexylfluorene- 3, 6 -diyl-co- 2, 8 -di(O-methylenecyclohexyl) dibenzothiophene-S,S-dioxide- 3, 7 -diyl) p(Fm-SOCy) in three different co-monomer ratios, P 1 – 3, give deep blue electroluminescence peaking at 415 nm, with the ratio of 70 : 30 p(Fm : <b>SOCy)</b> producing a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) ηext, max 2. 7 %, whilst the ratio of 85 : 15 gave the highest maximum brightness Lmax of 81 cd m− 2, with CIE coordinates (0. 17, 0. 12) The analogous para series poly(9, 9 -dihexylfluorene- 2, 7 -diyl-co- 2, 8 -di(O-methylenecyclohexyl) dibenzothiophene-S,S-dioxide- 3, 7 -diyl) p(Fp-SOCy) and poly(9, 9 -dihexylfluorene- 2, 7 -diyl-co- 2, 8 -dihexyloxydibenzothiophene-S,S-dioxide- 3, 7 -diyl) p(Fp-SO 6) in two different ratios, P 4 – 7, produced blue emission peaking at ca. 450 nm. The ratio of 70 : 30 F : S units consistently gave better devices than the corresponding 50 : 50 co-polymers. It was also observed that co-polymers incorporating the bulkier <b>SOCy</b> derivatives gave more efficient and brighter devices, with polymer P 5 attaining a remarkable ηext, max 3. 2 %, 4. 4 cd A− 1, 3. 4 lm W− 1 and maximum brightness 2500 cd m− 2 with CIE (0. 16, 0. 18) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a subspace-based {{multimedia}} data mining framework is proposed for video semantic analysis, specifically video event/concept detection, by addressing two basic issues, i. e., semantic gap and rare event/concept detection. The proposed framework achieves full automation via multimodal content analysis and intelligent integration of distance-based and rule-based data mining techniques. The content analysis process facilitates the comprehensive video analysis by extracting low-level and middle-level features from audio/visual channels. The integrated data mining techniques effectively address these two basic issues by alleviating the class imbalance issue along {{the process and}} by reconstructing and refining the feature dimension automatically. The promising experimental performance on goal/corner event detection and sports/commercials/building concepts extraction from <b>socier</b> videos and TRECVID news collections demonstrates {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed framework. Furthermore, its unique domain-free characteristic indicates the great potential of extending the proposed {{multimedia data}} mining framework {{to a wide range of}} different application domain...|$|R
40|$|The {{cosmopolitan}} marine bivalve genus kisaea {{is predominantly}} composed of highly polyploid asexual lineages with one exception: the diploid, sexual Australian species L. australis. Two undescribed, direct-deireloping congeners co-occur with the indirect-developing L. austruliJ {{on the rocky}} intertidal of southeastern Australia. One of these, L. colmani sp. nov., is also diploid and sexual. The other direct-developing congener is an asexual polyploid composed {{of a variety of}} clonal lineages. All three sympatric Australian h a e a congeners are mor-phologically distinguishable, although prodissoconch distinctions are required to separate large polyploid clams from equivalently-sized L. australis. Similarities in mitochondria 1 gene sequence and in shell morphology suggest that L. australis and the Australian sytnpatric polyploid clones share an exclusive common ancestor despite differing in developmental mode, ploidy and reproductive mode. However, detailed karyological analyses failed to identify a chromosome set morphologically similar to that of L. australis among the sympatric Australian polypoid complement. We propose that generation of the polyploid Australian clones (presumably by hybridization) was followed by radical karyological rearrangement. 0 I 999 The Linnean <b>Socier)</b> of Londo...|$|R
5000|$|There {{were several}} replies to Darwin's enquiry in The Gardeners' Chronicle seeking {{evidence}} to support his idea that pollen masses attached themselves to a convenient place on an insect's back or head, usually its proboscis, to transport the pollen to another flower. One envelope appeared to be empty when it arrived at Down House, but when he looked further before discarding it he found several insect mouthparts with pollen masses attached. To help their daughter Henrietta convalesce from illness, the Darwins arranged to spend two months in Torquay. Darwin wrote: I have, owing to many interruptions, not been going on much with my regular work (though I have done the very heavy jobs of variation of Pigeons, Fowls, Ducks, Rabbits Dogs &c) but have been amusing myself with miscellaneous work.—I have been very lucky & have now examined almost every British Orchid fresh, & when at sea-side shall draw up rather long paper on the means of their fertilisation for Linn. <b>Socy</b> & I cannot fancy anything more perfect than the many curious contrivances.|$|R
40|$|Office hrs: 2 - 3 PM and by appt. Office: 3119 Art/Soc Bldg. This course {{examines}} both implicit {{and explicit}} population policies from an international perspective. Of special interest are the assumptions that population policies make {{about the nature}} of the family and gender relations and the role of ideology in the science-policy nexus. The general approach is historical and at the macro level, although individual consequences of policies [...] proposed and actual [...] are considered. [Note: Given the course on Work and Family Policy (<b>SOCY</b> 699 J) that I offer every few years, this course addresses family policy issues only in the context of population policies. ] We start with the first waves of the birth control and feminist movements and the extent to which these movements relate to one another. The relevance of the eugenics movement and its interest in "racial betterment " is also examined. Then we study the widespread concern in the 1930 s about depopulation in Europe (when family allowances were introduced), followed by readings on the post-World War II family planning and international population movements. In addition to studying national concerns about the baby boom and subsequent low fertility in highly industrialized countries (and exceptionally low fertility in some European countries), w...|$|R
40|$|In {{the light}} of a resurgent {{interest}} in religio-ethnio background, the usage of the concepts of identity and identification was examined. Identity was viewed both asa higher-order concept (i. e., an organizing referent) and asa lower-order concept including several specific facets (social identity, personal identity, ego identity, and self-conception), whose empirical re-ferents with respect o religio-ethnicity were suggested. Identification was conceived of both as a process anda product, with empirical research of the latter in respect o religio-ethnicity operating on behavioral and at-titudinal evels. Some implications for future research were suggested. INTBODUCTION There has been of late a growing in-terest among articulate persons in the Ameriean population in establishŸ the sources of one's identity in one's religio-ethnic background. Despite the clear ar-ticulation of this contero there remains a good deal of ambiguity as to the ap-propriate conceptualization f suela no-tions as identity and identification i the study of religŸ By no means is this ambiguous eoneeptualization con-fined only to the statements of citizens at large; the diflqculty appears also in the work of <b>socŸ</b> seientists. If this issue {{is going to be a}} subject of serious civic con-cero as well as social scientifie researeh, then some elarification is in order. Thus, it is the intention of this paper to pro-vide some altemative conceptualizations of what the meaning of religio-ethnie identity and identification is. Ir is necessary, however, to first under-stand what ah ethnic group is and why ethnicity 1 has beeome such an important phenomenon. Ah ethnic group may be defined asa group of individuals "with a shared sense of peoplehood " (M. Gor-don, p. 24) based on presumed shared so-ciocultural experienees and/or similar physical characteristics. Such groups may be viewed by their members and/or out-siders as religious, racial, national, lŸ guistic, and/or geographieal. Thus, what ethnic group members have in common is their ethnicity, or sense of peoplehood, * This paper is a revision of one presented at the Annual Meeting of the Society for th...|$|R
