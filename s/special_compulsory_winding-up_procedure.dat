In 1896 they created a company called Industrial Contract Corporation (Limited) with directors James Jackson (Chairman), Newton, Bailey and Burbidge.

This new business became involved with the purchase and sale of a store in Clapham, London called Grice and Son. The purchase price was about £17,000 and the sale price £48,000. It transpired that the directors selling the business and those buying were the same individuals, {{but this was not}} declared on the prospectus nor was the profit they made from the deal. A dispute with the shareholder led to the prospects of a <b>winding-up</b> <b>procedure</b> in public court.

(Commercial law) This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} explore the fundamental differences between the rights of employees in terms of windiqg-up procedures and that of business rescue proceedings. I will be specifically looking at each <b>procedure,</b> <b>winding-up</b> and business rescue proceedings, and the effect {{that each of these}} procedures have on the rights of employees. In terms of the analysis of the procedures, I will be looking at the history of both insolvency law and labour law, as well as a look at the old Companies Act of 1973 and specifically at judicial management. By looking at the history we can gain an outlook on the problems we encountered then and how they can be improved today. I will then move on to look specifically at the specific proceedings of winding-up in Chapter 14 of the old 1973 Act and Chapter 6 of the new 2008 for the provisions on business rescue. Through analysing the proceedings I will also look at the legal position in other jurisdictions on the specific matter into account. Specifically I will look to the UK and Australia. Additionally, I will be looking at the International Labour Organisations position on employees' rights in terms of insolvency law. The specific rights of employees that I will be considering are employees rights to commence proceedings, their right to be informed, their right to be consulted, the effect on their employment contracts, retrenchments, claims which they may have against the company as well as the specific rights of employees {{in the case of a}} transfer of the business. In analysing all of the above aspects, I will come to conclude from my findings that the rights afforded to employees under business rescue and Chapter 6 of the 2008 Act are extremely beneficial to the employees and are so extensive that they cover almost all rights of employees. In comparison with the rights afforded to employees' in terms of <b>winding-up</b> <b>procedures</b> under Chapter 14 of the 1973 Act these rights are stiII beneficial to employees but they are not as extensive.

40|$|The {{number of}} {{offenders}} {{with eating disorders}} in women's prisons in Japan has grown annually over the last 15 years. Women's prisons have experienced significant difficulties {{in the management of}} patients with eating disorders who have body-critical complications arising from low body weight, in addition to behavioral problems. Patients in Japan's 185 correctional facilities who display high refractoriness or who present a physical risk are transferred to the Hachioji medical prison, a national specialty hospital operated by the Ministry of Justice. The medical prison must manage any psychosomatic problems necessary for the safety of inmates regardless of a patient's wishes. The most common conviction resulting in imprisonment of women with eating disorders was shoplifting (n = 44; 63 %), with the second most common being drug-offenses (n = 17; 24 %). While shoplifting is of concern in relation to eating disorders, a causal relationship remains unclear. Most patients in the shoplifting group did not have histories of antisocial and/or impulsive behaviors such as drug abuse, sexual deviation, self-injury, or other criminal activity. Instead, shoplifting appears to be an obsessive-compulsive behavior deeply rooted in the psychopathology of severe eating disorder patients. Patients in this group tended to have histories of relatively high education and steady employment, although most also had histories of prolonged eating disorders and unstable treatment. Although adherence to treatment was poor among patients with eating disorders in the medical prison, body weight and behavioral problems improved following treatment in the <b>special</b> <b>compulsory</b> environment, without severe sequelae or patient death. The Ministry of Justice recently established another specialized ward for the care for female patients with eating disorders. If greater emphasis is placed on early-stage, protective, medical treatment, the number of patients with eating disorders in prisons may decrease. Further research is required to investigate the relationship between shoplifting and eating disorders...|$|R

25|$|It {{was soon}} clear that strict demand {{reduction}} programs {{would be needed}} to avoid widespread blackouts. In June 2001, the government created the Crisis Management Board (CGE), chaired by President Cardoso himself. The CGE received special powers among which was the authority to set up <b>special</b> tariffs, implement <b>compulsory</b> rationing and blackouts, and bypass normal bidding procedures of the purchase of new plant equipment. Instead of resorting to rolling blackouts, the government chose to apply a quota system. Quotas were established for all the consumers based on historical and target consumption level, applying bonuses for consumption well below the prescribed level, penalties for over-consumption and some freedom for the large users to trade their quotas in a secondary market. The government's goal of reducing historical consumption levels by at least 20% for an eight-month period was successfully achieved, with the government having to pay over US$200 million in bonuses to residential, industrial, and commercial customers. This achievement allowed the system to overcome that long period without blackouts and brownouts and proved the potential of demand-side management and energy efficiency efforts, which were able to create a virtual capacity of 4,000MW, helping the country to bridge the supply demand gap in a very economic way. In addition, the government launched a program for contracting emergency generation capacity, with bids for a total of 2,100MW of new thermal capacity accepted.|$|R

The research adopted a participatory design; the researchers followed four teams, totally 20 teachers and paraprofessionals’ work through video observation, discussions, feedback and lectures on assessment. The teams documented classroom teaching and assessment of students' abilities in different subject. The data in this study are based on teams’ written texts.

The study deals with questions about learning and socialization in special schools for pupils with moderate to severe learning difficulties. The overall aim is to study the interaction between pupils and teachers and describe the patterns, forms and content in their vocal- and non-vocal interaction in the classroom. A point of departure is that learning occurs in a social context and in collaboration with others, and the theoretical framework in the research is inspired by a socio-cultural perspective and an interactionistic perspective. My specific research questions are: • What kind of patterns appears in the interaction between pupils and teachers in the classroom? • What kind of learning- and socialization processes appears in the verbal- and non-verbal interaction between pupils and teachers?

They can pursue amounts resulting from their share in the joint matrimonial estate, filing the claim with the judge – commissioner. They can also demand exemption from the bankrupt estate assets which do not belong to the bankrupt. Sometimes they do not have any impact on the activity of a bankrupt spouse, for example, they cannot resist the petition to declare bankruptcy.

30|$|To {{deal with}} this {{paradoxical}} situation, they benefited from the EU’s institutional framework. At the EU level, they developed a legal basis for readmission of irregular immigrants by other countries, through which the EU would govern the uncontrolled immigration without its members’ legal obligations (e.g. the principle of non-refoulement). As a result, the EU members signed re-admission agreements with 17 different countries [75], and as of 2018, the EU continues readmission negotiations with more countries, namely, Belarus, Nigeria, Tunisia, Jordan, Morocco and Algeria [76]. Within this context, the EU and Turkey signed a readmission agreement in 2014 [77]; however, the Syrian immigrant influx in 2015 made a <b>special</b> measure <b>compulsory</b> for the EU members. The Syrian immigrant influx to the EU countries had been the biggest refugee crisis since the WWII, and the control of this influx without Turkey’s help was almost impossible for the EU members as the Syrian refugees used Turkey as the main transition route [78, 79]. To illustrate, in 2015, over 1.2 million asylum seekers (more than double the number in 2014), mainly from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, were registered in the EU [80]. Furthermore, the Islamic terrorist attacks {{are one of the}} main reasons behind the securitization of immigration [81], and this fact made the immigration influx from Syria a more important security problem in the EU. Especially, the alleged linkage between the Paris attacks in 2015 and the Syrian refugees showed the fragility of the issue [82]. For example, according to Eurobarometer 84 [83], 58 % of the participants perceived immigration as the most important problem among the EU nations in Autumn 2015 (this amount was 20 % higher compared to the survey conducted in Spring 2015). As a result, the delicacy of the Syrian refugee problem made cooperation with Turkey compulsory for the EU. As noted above, even the German Chancellor Merkel needed to admit the necessity of the cooperation with Turkey in the case of the Syrian refugee crisis [84]. In this regard, the main expectation of the EU members from Turkey is that it should prevent the Syrian refugee influx as much as possible and properly implement the readmission agreement signed in 2014 [79]. However, it was not easy to convince Turkey for this heavy burden without giving significant concessions (e.g. the acceleration of the accession negotiations and free travel for Turkish citizens in the Schengen Area).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{analysis}} of the fair equality of the concept of opportunity {{from the perspective of the}} moral and reasonable justifications brought to support positive discrimination. Although contemporary democratic societies guarantee the absence of discrimination by securing the formal equality of opportunity, this seems to be insufficient to balance opportunities. The Rawlsian model has gained ground, by advancing a redistribution of the resources to support the disadvantaged ones, which is implemented through <b>special</b> measures. The <b>compulsory</b> quotas for admission to higher education or public institutions, addressed to some disadvantaged groups, are one of the effective means of implementing fairness. As this system has shattered the principle of reward judging by one‟s merits, and ending up as a form of inverse discrimination of the majority groups, it is necessary that we analyse the arguments and the boomerang effects of the special measures. The undertaking proposed by the present paper is structured around highlighting the ethical aspects, as well as the consequences resulting from the arguments in favour of positive discrimination. Do we have the moral obligation to make up for the past inequalities suffered by some groups? Does preferential treatment really ensure the genuine integration of such groups? Do special measures contribute in creating social justice? Without the claim of having responded definitively and exhaustively to these questions, this paper attempts to emphasise the ethical dilemma that raises when special measures favour one group or another, when a group is protected judging by only one criterion, or when only an implementation area is selected...|$|R
40|$|The {{inauguration of}} federal {{government}} policies assuring {{that all students}} attending {{public schools in the}} United States have equal access to a highly qualified education, sparked national attention on improving the performance of rural schools and districts. Consequently, one in ten students is educated in remote school districts, and a large number of remote rural districts serve students that are minorities and poor. In many instances, the talents and abilities of the students served in rural schools and districts are less likely developed or noticed when compared to urban and suburban school districts. For administrators of remote rural high schools, finding ways that provided a quality education, often, had to come at a low cost. Since, the use of technology for instruction are cost efficient, effective and had the potential to replace or supplement traditional classroom instruction; many remote rural schools found its use promising (Irvin, Hannum, Banks, Farmer 2 ̆ 6 Keane, 2009). The {{purpose of this study was}} to explain the extent to which using instructional technology influenced the operation of an isolated rural high school and the extent to which, technology impacts student achievement. The study focused on one relative isolated rural public high school located in the southern part of the United States, which served students in grades nine- through twelve, regular and <b>special</b> education, and <b>compulsory</b> programs. A qualitative case study method that used instruments such as interviews, observations, documents, and archival records collected data for the study. The data collected enabled the researcher to capture and provide a rich description of the events that occurred at the site in an effort to answer two central research questions; a) given the relative isolation and limited access to resources faced by rural, isolated high schools, to what extent does the use of technology influence the operation of the school? b) To what extent does the use of technology in isolated rural high schools impacts students’ achievement? Themes identified from the analysis of findings were (a) the culture and climate of the school, (b) the role of instructional technology, (c) the outcomes of using instructional technology, and (d) resource requirements. Findings of data revealed that the practice of incorporating technology in an isolated rural high to manage the school and for teaching and learning yielded positive results. Results of findings indicated that technology had positively influenced the school culture and climate, enhanced the proficiency of the operational practices of the school, and improved the effectiveness of the instructional practices of the school. The incorporation of instructional technology had a positive impact on the student achievement. The school experienced an improvement in the student academic behavior, preparation for college, preparation life, and credentials for careers...|$|R
40|$|This {{evaluation}} {{is a part}} of the project “Integrating Refugee and Asylum-seeking Children in the Educational Systems of EU Member States: Evaluation and Promotion of Current Best Practices” (INTEGRACE). The main objective of the INTEGRACE project is to promote the educational integration of refugee and asylum-seeking children (RASC) in the EU by developing common standards and sharing best practices in policies and programmes development and evaluation,   with a speciﬁc focus on the needs of vulnerable groups (e. g. children who have been victims of crime, unaccompanied children). The main purpose of this evaluation of best practices concerning refugee and asylum-seeking children (RASC) will be “[ [...] . ] to analyze to what extent and under what conditions, these practices could be replicated in a different context. ” The principle aim of this evaluation and of the SIA to be conducted in Slovenia and Bulgaria will be to assess the possibility of replication and the social impacts of the eventual implementation of a practice which has already been identiﬁed and evaluated as a good one in some of the old member states of EU. The aim of the conducted {{evaluation is}} to facilitate the transfer of knowledge from old to new EU member States, thereby allowing the latter to deal more effectively with the their new migration situation. Furthermore, the evaluation at hand will provide the grounds for developing a common EU framework to addressing the educational needs of RASC in the near future. In the Swedish country report a number of so-called best practices aimed for RASC were described. Based on responses and discussions with the partner in Slovenia, a case was chosen on the implementation of the “General recommendations for newly arrived pupils” in three schools in Bollnäs, a municipality, located in the middle of Sweden. This report, will therefore analyse in detail how these “General recommendations” are implemented into the Swedish school system in light of an evaluation conducted by the authority The Schools Inspectorate (SI), but also provide the reader with a short note on the reasons for the Swedish National Agency for Education to formulate these recommendations concerning education for newcomers. The concept “newly arrived” refers, according to the “General recommendations”, to <b>compulsory,</b> <b>special,</b> upper secondary or special upper secondary school children or youth who arrive in Sweden near the beginning of or during a speciﬁc school year. They are not native speakers of Swedish and are as a rule unable to speak or understand Swedish; ﬁnding themselves in Sweden on different terms and under different circumstances. Many have a permanent residence permit already upon arrival. Others have obtained a residence permit after a long wait in a refugee camp or lodging with acquaintances. Some are asylum seekers. Of the latter group, most have arrived with their parents, whereas others are unaccompanied and have no legal guardian. Some arrive based on their connections to refugees with a residence permit. Others have come after a parent has married a Swedish citizen. Still others are in hiding in the hope of revision of a previously denied asylum application. Finally, some are so-called paperless children – children or youth present in Sweden who have not applied for a residence permit and who are, thus, not registered with the Migration Board. A child or an adolescent coming to school may, thus, have arrived directly from another country or may have been present in Sweden for a shorter or longer period of time. Thus, being “newly arrived” may mean being new to the school but previously present in Sweden, in some cases having learned Swedish to some extent. 4 In other  words, behind the term “newly arrived” we ﬁnd a vast range of children where refugee and asylumseeking children (RASC) are also included.  INTEGRACE, Integrationg Refugee and Asylum seeking Children in Education, European Refugee Fun...|$|R
40|$|U nastavnom kurikulumu evaluacija je važna varijabla i veoma važna aktivnost učenika i učitelja. Evaluacija ima snažan utjecaj na ukupno školsko i razredno-nastavno ozračje. Učenici vole školu u mjeri koliko su zadovoljni oblicima i rezultatima evaluacije, napose rezultatima unutarnje evaluacije. S obzirom na svrhu razlikuju se različite vrste evaluacije. U tekstu je prikazana priroda i filozofija vanjske i unutarnje evaluacije, te formativne i sumativne evaluacije u osnovnoj i srednjoj školi. Evaluacija donosi informacije učenicima i učiteljima o uspješnosti zajedničkog rada u nastavnom procesu. Priroda i vrste evaluacije ovise o filozofiji odgoja odnosno o pedagoškoj koncepciji neke škole. U stručnim krugovima prevladava gledišta da osnovna i obvezna škola treba omogućiti uspjeh svim sudionicima, odnosno da se osnovna pedagoška paradigma može iskazati sintagmom „pedagogija uspjeha za sve”. To znači da takva škola treba biti utemeljena na suradnji i nastojanjima učitelja da omoguće svakom učeniku optimalno ostvarivanje osobnih mogućnosti. Srednje općeobrazovne i strukovne škole nisu obvezne i utemeljene su na izvana postavljenim standardima te na selekciji i kompeticiji. Selekcija se odvija prilikom upisa u te škole te tijekom odvijanja nastavnih aktivnosti jer škola treba osigurati da svi učenici zadovolje postavljene kriterije i standarde. Te spoznaje o selektivnosti škole uvjetuju kriterije unutarnje evaluacije i školskog ocjenjivanja. Za postavljanje pedagoški svrsishodnog i kvalitetnog modela evaluacije treba definirati ciljeve. U radu su prikazane različite razine konkretizacije odgojnih i obrazovnih ciljeva te njihovo uvjetovanje izbora nastavnih strategija i modela evaluacije.

Evaluation is a {{significant}} variable in the teaching curriculum and a very important activity for both student and teacher. Evaluation has a strong impact on the overall teaching mood {{in the school and}} classroom. Students like school {{to the extent that they}} are satisfied with the forms and results of evaluation, especially those of internal evaluation. There are different types of evaluation, depending on its purpose. This paper shows the nature and philosophy of external and internal evaluation, as well as of formative and summative evaluation, in basic and secondary school. Evaluation gives information to students and teachers on the success of their common work in the teaching and learning process. The nature and types of evaluation depend on the philosophy of education, in other words, on the pedagogical concepts of a particular school. The view most frequently held in professional circles is that basic school, which is compulsory, should enable all its participants to achieve success, and that the fundamental pedagogical paradigm may be expressed in the syntagm ”pedagogy of success for all”. This means that such a school should be based on the cooperation and efforts of teachers to allow every student to fully realise his or her abilities. Secondary education conducted in general and vocational schools is not compulsory and relies on externally-set standards and on selection and competition. Selection in these schools takes place at the stage of enrolment, as well as in the course of the teaching process since the school should equip all the students to meet the set criteria and standards. These understandings of the selectivity of the school have an effect on the internal evaluation criteria and on school assessment. To establish a pedagogically purposeful and high-quality evaluation model, it is important to define goals. This paper shows different levels of specification of educational goals and their effect on the choice of teaching strategies and evaluation models. The author of this paper takes the issues of selectivity, cooperation and competitiveness as the starting points for defining the evaluation purpose and criteria, and then presents the school assessment scales in Croatia and several other countries. Attention is also given to the position of students with <b>special</b> needs in <b>compulsory</b> school, and to special criteria to evaluate the success of such students. Im Unterrichtscurriculum ist die Evaluation eine wichtige Variable und eine bedeutende Aktivität von Lehrern und Schülern. Die Evaluation übt einen starken Einfluss auf die gesamte Schul — und Unterrichtsatmosphäre aus. Die Schüler mögen Schule in dem Maße, in dem sie mit den Formen und Ergebnissen der Leistungsbeurteilung, insbesondere der inneren Leistungsbeurteilung zufrieden sind. Nach ihrem Zweck lassen sich verschiedene Evaluationsformen unterscheiden. Im Text wird die Natur und Philosophie der äußeren und inneren Leistungsbeurteilung aufgezeigt, sowie die formative und summative Evaluation in der Grund — und Mittelschule. Die Evaluation bzw. Leistungsbeurteilung gibt den Schülern und Lehrern Auskunft über den Erfolg der gemeinsamen Arbeit im Unterrichtsprozess. Die Natur und Form der Evaluation hängt von der Erziehungsphilosophie und pädagogischen Konzeption der jeweiligen Schule. In den Fachkreisen überwiegt die Meinung, dass die Grund — bzw. Pflichtschule allen Beteiligten Erfolg ermöglichen sollte, bzw. dass sich das pädagogische Grundparadigma mit der Losung „Erfolgspädagogik für alle“ umschreiben lässt. Das heißt, dass solche Schule auf der Zusammenarbeit und Bemühungen von Lehrern beruhen sollte, jedem Schüler eine optimale Entfaltung seiner persönlichen Fähigkeiten ermöglichen soll. Die allgemein- und berufsbildenden Mittelschulen sind keine Pflichtschulen und beruhen auf von außen vorgegebenen Standards sowie auf der Selektion und dem Wettbewerb. Die Selektion findet bei der Immatrikulation in diese Schulen sowie während des Unterrichtsprozesses statt, denn die Schule soll sicherstellen, dass die Schüler die vorgegebenen Kriterien und Bildungsstandards erfüllen. Diese Erkenntnisse von der selektiven Aufgabe der Schule bedingen auch Kriterien der inneren Evaluation und der schulischen Leistungsbeurteilung. Zum Aufbau eines pädagogisch zweckmäßigen und qualitätvollen Evaluationsmodells sollen vor allem Ziele definiert werden. In der Arbeit werden verschiedene Konkretisierungsebenen von Erziehungs- — und Bildungszielen sowie deren Einfluss auf die Wahl der Unterrichtsstrategien und Evaluationsmodellen dargestellt. Der Autor untersucht auch die Fragen von Selektion, Kooperation und Wettbewerb als Ausgangspunkten für die Definition der Evaluationskriterien und— zwecke, weiterhin stellt er Skalen für die schulische Leistungsbeurteilung in Kroatien und einigen anderen Ländern dar. Aufmerksamkeit wird auch der Stellung der behinderten Schüler in der Pflichtschule gewidmet sowie besonderen Kriterien für die Leistungsbeurteilung solcher Schüler...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was founded with an objective {{of finding the}} most effective method of preservation of traditional Sri Lankan mural paintings. Investigation was separated into three main areas. These are determination of necessary actions in preservation, investigation of preservation mechanisms and investigation of applicability of these methods. Actions needed in preservation were identified by analyzing present condition of paintings. Paintings were classified into several logical groups to facilitate analysis. A criterion for classification was developed considering all possible factors of sorting. Classification of paintings according to the period of production was the most appropriate criterion since this automatically classified paintings on technique, school, climate, pattern of decay, pattern of deterioration {{and the degree of}} deterioration. Analysis of condition of paintings disclosed following facts: 1. all paintings are in a rapid rate of decay 2. deterioration is a result of natural decay and accelerated decay due to dilapidation 3. intervention based on synthetic resins prevented fragmentation and loss of material but accelerated the rate of decay This information led to the decision that adequate repair -and prevention of deterioration would be the most needed actions in conserving Sri Lankan paintings. Analyzes of these facts emphasized that there was a definite need to develop a viable method of reduction of the rate of decay of paintings. Development of the most appropriate method needed following background information: principles of traditional technology; social aspects that led to creation, usage and maintenance of paintings and traditional methods of conservation and maintenance. There were few direct and indirect sources to gather this information. These were traditional technical texts, historic records, legend memory and information generated from physical and chemical analyses. Present social conditions that led to survival and destruction of paintings were also analyzed. Technical analyses were based on structure, composition and behavior of Sri Lankan paintings and survival and performance of different types of paintings in different climatic zones. Most appropriate chemical and physical analytical methods were used in the analysis. Constant nature of structure, composition, production process and procedure of painting in paintings belonging to a particular class and analogy among different classes indicated strict adherence of production techniques to rules and regulations of traditional technology. Seven major Sri Lankan painting techniques were identified. Classical, medieval and southern are the dominant techniques among them. The most major difference among these techniques is the structure and composition of ground. Two major techniques were therefore defined based on the usage of the process of carbonation in the ground. The characteristic feature of Sri Lankan painting techniques is the use of biotechnology. A heavy amount of microbiological actions and enzymatic reactions had been used to attain key properties not gained by other means. Use of most stable material is a law of traditional technology. Certain principles of traditional technology that realized appropriate coordination between paintings and environment were identified. A particular traditional painting technique fulfilled the needs of the corresponding painting school and users of paintings produced by that technique. Usage and maintenance also followed definite rules, regulations and guidelines. These were identified by analyzing later modifications to paintings. Special attention was given to understand actions occurring in paintings. These actions were identified as interactions of paintings with the environment. Interactions with environment and response of paintings to these interactions were defined as behavior. Water transmission and thermal movement of paintings were identified as main actions of behavior. These dynamic physical actions bear on most other physical, chemical and microbiological actions. Paintings on masonry and wood support absorb water through support, transmit towards the surface and evaporate on the surface. Paintings on rock support absorb water through the surface and disperse throughout the ground. Porosity of ground and permeability of paint layer are important parameters in both of these absorption types. Most actions occurring in paintings are detrimental to them and called actions of decay. Few favorable actions called actions of preservation were also identified. Various factors become favorable or detrimental in specific ranges and combinations with other factors. Decay is a continuous process associated with every painting. Decay results in a change of material, material properties and structure. These changes bring about deterioration, i. e. formation of defects. The rate of decay accelerates with the formation of defects. Behavior of every painting becomes destructive with the formation of defects. Prevention of decay is the principle action necessary in preserving paintings. This is the key task necessary to preserve deteriorated traditional mural paintings. Prevention of fragmentation and loss of material are other important needs. This investigation was centered on determination of the most effective method of minimizing the rate of decay. Simulated samples of paintings were used in the investigation. Production processes of these simulated samples were determined using information obtained from traditional technical texts and chemical and physical analyses of samples of paintings. It was found that two types of samples could represent all Sri Lankan paintings. These are samples with lime ground and samples with clay ground. 1 twas decided to produce samples at four categories of increasing complexity to reduce errors during analysis. Elementary samples simulated the painting ground, basic samples simulated the multilayered structure of paintings and advanced samples simulated complex structure of paintings. Advanced samples had heterogeneous paint layers and complex ground. Representative samples represented the actual paintings. Enzymatic and microbiological actions mentioned in traditional technical texts were used to produce representative samples. This investigation needed methods to measure behavior and the rate of decay. Behavior could be adequately measured using parameters of main actions of behavior. An indirect method based on intensity of defects and difference in hue was used to measure relative rates of decay. Methods of reduction of rate of decay tested were removal of factors of decay, environmental control, repair of defects, induction of equilibrium behavior and few specific actions of preservation. These different methods were successful at various degrees. Removal of some factors of decay reduced the rate of decay at all instances. However, it had a limited amount of success {{due to the fact that}} total removal of some factors like water and thermal energy increased decay. Environmental control remarkably reduced the rate of decay. However, this did not guarantee the long-term existence of paintings. Furthermore it was difficult to adopt. Natural actions of preservation takes very long durations and difficult to manage. Maintaining conditions that enhancing these actions was the only external intervention possible. Further analysis of these methods of reduction of rate of decay disclosed the fact that all of these mechanisms were effective when they induce equilibrium. Special attention was therefore given to test possibility of reducing the rate of decay by inducing equilibrium behavior. Existence of a relationship between the degree of equilibrium and the rate of decay was the main hypothesis tested in this research. Relationship of equilibrium behavior and the rate of decay was studied at four levels using four categories of samples. A completely randomized design was used. Relationship between behavior and the rate of decay was tested with elementary, basic and advanced samples. Behavior was changed by altering input physical factors. A distinct relationship was observed. Relationship of degree of equilibrium with the rate of decay was also investigated with these samples. Equilibrium was quantitatively changed by allowing the samples to absorb moisture at different known rates under different known temperatures and relative humidity. A definite correlation existed. These relationships were significant (p<O. S) or highly significant (p<O. 1) in each category of all types of samples. Definite relationship existed between the degree of equilibrium in behavior and rate of decay of traditional paintings was established with a high confidence level. It was found that the degree of deviation from the optimal equilibrium is the factor that determined the rate of decay. Further analysis done with representative samples disclosed the fact that each Painting technique has a set of optimal' ranges of -equilibrium. There is an optimal point of equilibrium for each action and optimal range of overall equilibrium in each class of painting. This optimal level could be defined in terms of input parameters. Optimal level of equilibrium for each technique of painting could therefore be determined. Equilibrium reduced the probability of generation of defects. Equilibrium at optimal level reduced the rate of decay too. Analysis of mechanisms of reduction of rate of decay disclosed the fact that all methods of reducing the rate of decay minimize decay by inducing equilibrium. It was therefore emphasized that induction of equilibrium at the optimal level is the most effective method available to reduce the rate of decay of mural paintings. Mechanism of reduction of rate of decay by induction of equilibrium behavior was investigated using simulated samples. Paintings in equilibrium maintained all factors at their moderate rates. These intermediate levels approached optimal levels of most actions. Equilibrium brought about proper coordination between all actions. It did not allow any action to grow beyond the favorable limit. It reduced tear and wear. It tremendously decreased the probability of formation of defects. These factors are important to all paintings. Method of inducing equilibrium behavior at the most optimum level is called stabilization. Possibility of practical induction of stabilization was tested on simulated samples. All possible methods of stabilization were investigated. These are repair of defects, environmental control and application of controlled amounts of input factors. All ancient paintings have defects as a part and parcel of their structure. Adequate repair of these defects is <b>compulsory.</b> <b>Special</b> emphasis is therefore given to test possibility of stabilization by repair of defects. Samples were subjected to destructive intervention to generate defects. Their behavior was measured and compared with normal samples. Repair was done with traditional material and synthetic material. Quality of repair done with synthetic material was better than traditional material. Quality of repair with traditional material was also at an acceptable level. Repair with synthetic material however deviated behavior away from equilibrium. Repair with traditional material was effective in bringing equilibrium closer to the original level. It was therefore decided that repair of defects with traditional material could reduce the rate of decay of traditional mural paintings. Possibility of practical adoption of the method was also investigated in five selected sites. Necessary actual measurements were done; conservation plans were developed. It was found from this study that repair of paintings with traditional material and maintaining their environment within acceptable ranges were adequate for stabilization. Elaborate measurements were not necessary to adopt the stabilization method. It was established that the stabilization method can be adopted as a systematic process of reduction of rate of decay and decreasing the probability of emergence of defect...|$|R
