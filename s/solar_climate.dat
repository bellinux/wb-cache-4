40|$|One of the {{greatest}} problems encountered in greenhouses and buildings with large glazing is control of the internal atmosphere. The inherent characteristic of these buildings to act as solar collectors {{is to be used}} effectively for collecting and storing the excess solar energy. A new type of glazed roof, a <b>Solar</b> <b>Climate</b> Control roof system, was designed as a means to cool the interior environment of the greenhouses during the daytime and to heat during the nighttime or on overcast days. A heat exchanger-storage system, using water as a thermal mass is included {{in the design of the}} <b>Solar</b> <b>Climate</b> Control system. A film of water flows on the inner surface of the roof and absorbs the direct solar heat radiation, acting then as a cooling agent. The energy absorbed may be reused for nighttime heating.

The use of a soap solution rather than water alone for the <b>Solar</b> <b>Climate</b> Control water film system permitted a significant reduction in pumping rate and improved uniformity of the film.

40|$|This {{computer}} program, SOLINS, {{was developed}} to aid engineers and solar system designers in the accurate modeling of the average hourly solar insolation on a surface of arbitrary orientation. The program {{can be used to}} study insolation problems specific to residential and commercial applications where the amount of space available for solar collectors is limited by shadowing problems, energy output requirements, and costs. For tandem rack arrays, SOLINS will accommodate the use of augmentation reflectors built into the support structure to increase insolation values at the collector surface. As the use of flat plate solar collectors becomes more prevalent in the building industry, the engineer and designer must have the capability to conduct extensive sensitivity analyses on the orientation and location of solar collectors. SOLINS should prove to be a valuable aid in this area of engineering. SOLINS uses {{a modified version of the}} National Bureau of Standards model to calculate the direct, diffuse, and reflected components of total insolation on a tilted surface with a given azimuthal orientation. The model is based on the work of Liu and Jordan with corrections by Kusuda and Ishii to account for early morning and late afternoon errors. The model uses a parametric description of the average day <b>solar</b> <b>climate</b> to generate monthly average day profiles by hour of the insolation level on the collector surface. The model includes accommodation of user specified ground and landscape reflectivities at the collector site. For roof or ground mounted, tilted arrays, SOLINS will calculate insolation including the effects of shadowing and augmentation reflectors. The user provides SOLINS with data describing the array design, array orientation, the month, the <b>solar</b> <b>climate</b> parameter, the ground reflectance, and printout control specifications. For the specified array and environmental conditions, SOLINS outputs the hourly insolation the array will receive during an average day during the month specified, along with the total insolation the collector surface will receive over an average 24 -hour period. This program is written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and has been implemented on an IBM 370 computer with a central memory requirement of approximately 46 K of 8 bit bytes. The SOLINS routines were developed in 1979...|$|E

40|$|Through the 21 st century, global-mean {{stratospheric ozone}} abundances are {{projected}} to increase due to decreasing chlorine and bromine concentrations (as {{a consequence of the}} Montreal Protocol for Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer), and continued CO₂-induced cooling of the stratosphere.

40|$|A {{long list}} of {{empirical}} results strongly suggests that solar variations {{play an important role}} in climate change. We begin by trying to understand why such variations are crucial if we are to understand 20 th century climate change, and how it is related to the value of the climate sensitivity. The latter is of course necessary if we are to predict future climate change. We then review some of the aforementioned evidence, and in particular, the data which can be used to quantify the size of the <b>solar</b> <b>climate</b> link. We will end by building a more consistent picture for 20 th century global warming, while mentioning a few words on the expected 21 st century climate change. Introduction: why do we need to understand the climate role of the sun? In the standard picture advocated by the IPCC, most of the global warming observed over the 20 th century is attributed to the increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gasses (AGHG). Indeed, when one considers the observed increase in temperature and the increase in AGHG, it is very tempting to do so. However, we have to remember that there are many uncertainties...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{modeling}} {{and understanding the}} processes in {{the atmosphere of the}} Sun. The <b>solar</b> <b>climate</b> has implications for Earth's climate and effects many of our systems, for instance the Global Positioning System (GPS). In order to protect those systems, it is of vital importance to understand the underlying processes in the Sun that lead to solar flares and mass ejections. We model the energy transfer in the solar atmosphere by the equations of magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) with a gravity source term, and suitable initial and boundary conditions. Since there are no analytical results available for these equations, one has to simulate the solutions. This is usually done by finite volume methods. Standard finite volume methods, however, are found to be unstable in multiple dimensions in space. Therefore, we developed and implemented new robust and accurate methods for simulating the solutions of the MHD equations. We apply those methods to a two dimensional model with appropriate steady states. The key to obtain a robust scheme is to balance the gravity source with the numerical flux and the Godunov-Powell source. The resulting high order well-balanced schemes are tested on realistic configurations and are found to resolve the complex physical phenomena quite well...|$|E
40|$|If {{there is}} a {{significant}} sun-climate connection, it should be detectable in high-resolution paleoclimate records. Of particular interest is the last few thousand years, where we have both indices of solar variability (C- 14 and Be- 10) and climate variations (alpine glaciers, tree rings, ice cores, corals, etc.). Although there are a few exceptions, statistical analyses of solar and climate records generally indicates a flickering relationship between the two [...] sometimes it seems to be present, sometimes not. The most repeatable <b>solar</b> <b>climate</b> periods occur at approx. 120 and approx. 56 yrs, although {{there is a}}lso evidence for approx. 420 and approx. 200 yrs. power in some records. However, coherence between solar and climate spectra is usually low, and occurrence of solar spectra in climate records is sometimes dependent on choice of analysis program. These results suggest in general a relatively weak sun-climate link on time scales of decades to centuries. This conclusion is consistent with previous studies and with the observation that inferred climate fluctuations of 1. 0 to 1. 5 C on this time scale would require solar constant variations of approximately 0. 5 to 1. 0 percent. This change in forcing is almost an order of magnitude greater than observed changes over the last solar cycle and appears to be on the far-outer limit of acceptable changes for a Maunder Minimum-type event...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of large scale PV installations in space constrained countries has gradually shifted from production maximisation {{to that of}} reaching an optimised economic performance. The main {{reason for this is}} the ever decreasing price of the modules. This has resulted in systems with lower tilt angles, increased mutual shading and overloading of inverters by design, in the continuous quest of balancing reduced yield with development costs over the entire lifespan of the project. This approach has shifted the traditional view of evaluating a PV installation from a Euro/watt approach to the use of optimisation metrics such the Levelised Cost Of Electricity (LCOE) or Internal Rate of Return (IRR). Optimisation can be simply described as a balancing act, evaluating tradeoffs to assess which combination gives the best economic performance. By its very nature, optimisation is an iterative process. This paper evaluates a number of design parameters which, together with production modelling {{within the context of the}} Maltese <b>solar</b> <b>climate,</b> aims at identifying an optimum design for the building of a 2 MWp ground mounted PV installation.
