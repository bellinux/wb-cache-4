2500|$|In {{countries}} {{using other}} socket-outlet types, socket covers are sold {{to protect children}} from electrocution by inserting objects into otherwise unprotected sockets. Such covers are also sold in the UK, but the shutters of the [...] socket-outlet make these unnecessary. The Institution of Engineering and Technology published an article on socket covers by Mark Coles, its Technical Regulations Manager, in its journal [...] "Wiring Matters". [...] The article concludes that: [...] "Socket-outlets to BS1363 are the safest in the world and have been since they were first designed in the 1940s. <b>Socket</b> <b>protectors</b> are not regulated for safety, therefore, using a non-standard system to protect a long established safe system is not sensible." [...] The UK government does not collect statistics of injury or accidents related to use of socket covers.|$|E
40|$|In {{developed}} countries, {{the growing}} number of domestic accidents has pushed firms to find new devices (and to improve the current ones) in order to increase the level of domestic safety, especially for children, that are among the most affected. In order to prevent some of the " electrical risk " accidents, they have made various kinds of devices to cover the sockets (outlets) present in a normal house. These devices are called " <b>socket</b> cover <b>protectors</b> ", and, for the removable ones, their design has always been focused on the making of an object hard to be pulled out from the socket by children but easy to be managed by parents (so, easy to put in and to pull out for them). For all we know, it's never been considered the possibility that the aesthetic appearance of a device like that could be useful to dissuade a child from handling or trying to play with it. In this paper, we claim that a particular aesthetic analysis could be a useful tool if it would be introduced into the lifecycle design of a home safety product â€“ like a <b>socket</b> cover <b>protector</b> -in order to make a more effective device. In fact, our aesthetic analysis is structured in order to make an object that doesn't stimulate the curiosity of children (so, an object not aesthetically appealing), so that the likelihood of a contact between child and device is reduced (and so the likelihood for him to pull out the device) ...|$|R
