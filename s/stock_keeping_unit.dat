40|$|International audienceModeling the {{lead-time}} {{demand for the}} multiple slow-moving inventory items in the case when the available requests history is very short is a challenge for inventory management. The classical forecasting technique, {{which is based on}} the aggregation of the <b>stock</b> <b>keeping</b> <b>units</b> to overcome the mentioned historical data peculiarity, is known to lead to very poor performance in many cases important for industrial applications. An alternative approach to the demand forecasting for the considered problem is based on the Bayesian paradigm, when the initially developed population-averaged demand probability distribution is modified for each item using its specific requests history. This paper follows this approach and presents a new model, which relies on the beta distribution as a prior for the request probability, and allows to account for disparity in variance of demand between different <b>stock</b> <b>keeping</b> <b>units.</b> To estimate the model parameters, a special computationally effective technique based on the generalized method of moments is developed.

5000|$|Piece picking, {{also known}} as broken case picking or pick/pack operations, {{describes}} systems where individual items are picked.

5000|$|Some {{embodiments}} of omnichannel {{order fulfillment}} {{eliminate the need}} for bulk storage, pallets and lift trucks. Instead, products are sent directly to universal storage and pick modules. The process is designed so that items can be selected simultaneously for any channel requirements. Omnichannel solutions may operate where orders are not grouped into waves, as is common in pick operations. Instead, customer orders or product demand is entered into worker pick lists as soon as they are initiated for processing at the distribution center, which promotes both fulfillment flexibility and processing speed. [...] In such operations associates doing the picking don’t know whether they are picking an online order or a store order. [...] They pick and replenish simultaneously, work with dynamic <b>stock</b> <b>keeping</b> <b>unit</b> (SKU) locations, and generally touch and move items with minimal fear of introducing errors.|$|E

40|$|The {{fill rate}} {{is the most}} widely applied service level measure in {{industry}} {{and yet there is}} minimal advice available on how it should be differentiated on an individual <b>Stock</b> <b>Keeping</b> <b>Unit</b> (SKU) basis given that there is an overall system target service level. The typical approach utilized in practice, and suggested in academic textbooks, is to set the individual service levels equal to the targeted performance required across an entire stock base or a certain class of SKUs (e. g., in ABC classification). In this paper it is argued that this approach is far from optimal and a simple methodology is proposed that is shown (on real life datasets) to be associated with reductions in stock investments. In addition, the new approach is intuitive, very easy to implement and thus highly likely to be positively received by practitioners and software manufacturer...|$|E
