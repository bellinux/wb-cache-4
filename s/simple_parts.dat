25|$|Land Rover gave UK pram company Pegasus a licence {{to produce}} a three-wheeler range of Land Rover ATP pushchairs. The design {{reflected}} the heritage of the marque, with a light metal frame with canvas seating, held together with push-studs and tough <b>simple</b> <b>parts</b> like brakes and hinges. They could be collapsed completely flat, with wheels removed in seconds. The basic frame could be adapted with modules to allow a baby to lie flat or a bubble windscreen to completely enclose the child. The frame also came in long or short-handled versions, and could be repaired with home tools. The design was simple, light, and rugged and able to travel in all terrains (hence the ATP for all-terrain pushchair.) It came in three military looking colours: a light blue, a sand colour and olive drab. Production was discontinued in 2002.|$|E

In the band's early years, he generally played <b>simple</b> <b>parts</b> in 4/4 time, usually strings of steady 8th notes. Bono said of Clayton's early bass playing, [...] "Adam used to pretend he could play bass. He came round and started using words like 'action' and 'fret' and he had us baffled. He had the only amplifier, so we never argued with him. We thought this guy must be a musician; he knows what he's talking about. And then one day, we discovered he wasn't playing the right notes. That's what's wrong, y'know?" [...] His style has remained subtle and primarily supportive, but gradually become more sophisticated by integrating elements of Motown R and reggae and by offering more variety in his basslines.|$|E

40|$|The {{classical}} {{approach to}} solvability of a mathematical {{problem is to}} define a method which includes certain rules of operation or algorithms. Then using the defined method, one can show that some problems are solvable or not solvable or undecidable depending on the particular method. With numerical solutions implemented in a computer, {{it might be more}} practical to define solvability of a mathematical problem as a complex decomposition problem. The decomposition breaks the data into a <b>simple</b> <b>part</b> and a complex <b>part.</b> The <b>simple</b> <b>part</b> is the solvable part by the method prescribed in the problem definition. The complex part is the leftover of the <b>simple</b> <b>part.</b> Complex part can be viewed as the "residual" of data or operator. It should be interpreted and not to be discarded as useless. We will give different examples to illustrate the more practical definition of solvability. The complex part is not noise and should not be viewed as useless part of the data. It has its own merit in terms of topological or geological interpretation. We have de-emphasized absolute solvability and have emphasized the practical solvability where the <b>simple</b> and complex <b>parts</b> both play important roles. Comment: 4 figures, 8 page...|$|R

[...] The antithesis states: [...] "No complex thing in the world consists of <b>simple</b> <b>parts,</b> and everywhere in it there exists nothing simple."

[...] Kant does not tell us why he holds that a space must consist of spaces rather than of <b>simple</b> <b>parts.</b> Geometry regards space as made up of points, which are simple; and although, as we have seen, this view is not scientifically or logically necessary, it remains primâ facie possible, and its mere possibility is enough to vitiate Kant's argument. For, if his proof of the thesis of the antinomy were valid, and if the antithesis could only be avoided by assuming points, then the antinomy itself would afford a conclusive reason in favour of points. Why, then, did Kant think it impossible that space should be composed of points? ...|$|E

And therefore, lastly, and chiefly, {{you must}} love the creatures to whom you minister, your fellow-men; for, {{if you do}} not love them, not only will you be little {{interested}} in the passing events of life, but in all your gazing at humanity, you will be apt to be struck only by outside form, and not by expression. It is only kindness and tenderness which will ever enable you to see what beauty there is in the dark eyes that are sunk with weeping, and in the paleness of those fixed faces which the earth's adversity has compassed about, till they shine in their patience like dying watchfires through twilight. But it is not this only which makes it needful for you, if you would be great, to be also kind; there is a most important and all-essential reason in the very nature of your own art. So soon as you desire to build largely, and with addition of noble sculpture, you will find that your work must be associative. You cannot carve a whole cathedral yourself--you can carve but few and <b>simple</b> <b>parts</b> of it.

If you have genius, you will yourselves take the lead in the building you design; you will carve its porch and direct its disposition. But for all subsequent advancement of its detail, you must trust to the agency and the invention of others; and it rests with you either to repress what faculties your workmen have, into cunning subordination to your own; or to rejoice in discovering even the powers that may rival you, and leading forth mind after mind into fellowship with your fancy, and association with your fame.|$|E

40|$|Classical {{approach}} of solvability problem has shed much light {{on what we}} can solve and what we cannot solve mathematically. Starting with quadratic equation, {{we know that we}} can solve it by the quadratic formula which uses square root. Polynomial is a generalization of quadratic equation. If we define solvability by using only square roots, cube roots etc, then polynomials are not solvable by radicals (square root, cube root etc). We can classify polynomials into simple (solvable by radicals) and complex (not solvable by radicals). We will use the same metaphor to separate what is solvable (<b>simple</b> <b>part)</b> and what is not solvable (complex part). This paper is a result of our presentation at a University of Houston seminar. In this paper, we will study seismic complexity through the eyes of solvability. We will investigate model complexity, data complexity and operator complexity. Model complexity is demonstrated by multiple scattering in a complex model like Cantor layers. Data complexity is studied through Betti numbers (topology/cohomology). Data can be decomposed as <b>simple</b> <b>part</b> and complex <b>part.</b> The <b>simple</b> <b>part</b> is solvable as an inverse problem. The complex part could be studied qualitatively by topological method like Betti numbers. Operator complexity is viewed through semigroup theory, specifically through idempotents (opposite of group theory). Operators that form a group are invertible (solvable) while semigroup of operators is not invertible (not solvable) in general. Comment: 25 pages, 47 figures, 2012 University of Houston semina...|$|R
