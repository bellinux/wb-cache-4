40|$|Abstract: Complete {{dislocation}} of the talus not <b>accompanied</b> <b>by</b> a <b>fracture</b> is a {{very rare}} injury. The injury is encountered as a closed one even more rarely. Reviewing the literature we found that proposed treatments for total talus dislocation varied from primary talectomy or arthodesis (to avoid complications) to closed reduction and an under knee cast. Most importantly, there was no agreement among authors about the method of reduction (open/closed). We report our experience with two cases of closed total talus dislocation not <b>accompanied</b> <b>by</b> a <b>fracture,</b> and review the literature to retrieve evidence on whether a closed or open treatment should be preferred {{for this type of}} injury...|$|R

30|$|The {{mechanism}} of injury is usually a fall on an outstretched arm, and, in rare cases, direct trauma (Morrey 2000; Mason 1954; Johnston 1962).

500|$|The {{amount of}} energy {{transferred}} to the lung is determined in a large part by the compliance (flexibility) of the chest wall. Children's chests are more flexible because their ribs are more elastic and there is less ossification of their intercostal cartilage. [...] Therefore, their chest walls bend, absorbing less of the force and transmitting more {{of it to the}} underlying organs. An adult's more bony chest wall absorbs more of the force itself rather than transmitting it. Thus children commonly get pulmonary contusions without fractures overlying them, while elderly {{people are more likely to}} suffer fractures than contusions. One study found that pulmonary contusions were <b>accompanied</b> <b>by</b> <b>fractures</b> 62% of the time in children and 80% of the time in adults.|$|R

40|$|The multi-wavelength {{observations}} of the 2004 December 27 Giant Flare (GF) from SGR 1806 - 20 and its long-lived radio afterglow are briefly reviewed. The GF {{appears to have been}} produced by a dramatic reconfiguration of the magnetic field near the surface of the neutron star, possibly <b>accompanied</b> <b>by</b> <b>fractures</b> in the crust. The explosive release of over 10 {sup 46 } erg (isotropic equivalent) powered a one-sided mildly relativistic outflow. The outflow produced a new expanding radio nebula, that is still visible over a year after the GF. Also considered are the constraints on the total energy in the GF, the energy and mass in the outflow, and on the external density, as well as possible implications for short {gamma}-ray bursts and potential signatures in high energy neutrinos, photons, or cosmic rays.

40|$|Nasal bone <b>fractures</b> {{are often}} <b>accompanied</b> <b>by</b> septal <b>fractures</b> or {{deformity}}. Posttraumatic nasal deformity is usually caused <b>by</b> septal <b>fractures.</b> Submucosal resection and septoplasty {{are commonly used}} surgical techniques for the correction of septal deviation. However, septal perforation or saddle nose deformity is a known complication of submucosal resection. Hence, we chose to perform septoplasty, which is a less invasive procedure, as the primary treatment for nasal bone <b>fractures</b> <b>accompanied</b> <b>by</b> septal <b>fractures.</b> During septoplasty, we used a bioabsorbable mesh as an internal splint. We used the endonasal approach and inserted the mesh bilaterally between the mucoperichondrial flap and the septal cartilage. The treatment outcomes were evaluated by computed tomography (CT) and the nasal obstruction symptom evaluation (NOSE) scale. The CT scans demonstrated a significant improvement in the septal deviation postoperatively. The symptomatic improvement rated by the NOSE scale was greater at 1 month and 6 months after surgery compared to the preoperative status. There were no cases of extrusion or infection of the implant. In cases of moderate or severe septal deviation without dislocation from the vomerine groove on the CT scan, our technique should be {{considered one of the}} treatments of choice...|$|R
40|$|The {{practical}} {{implementation of this}} study was enabled by taking into consideration all the traumatized cases <b>accompanied</b> <b>by</b> <b>fractures,</b> presented at the Clinic of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine during the period of March 2006 - March 2010. Special help for the implementation {{of this study was}} even offered by some private clinics in Tirana, from which we took a considerable number of valuable data. The cases of traumatized dogs were numerous and in different situations. Thus from this high number of the traumatizations <b>accompanied</b> <b>by</b> different <b>fractures</b> (altogether 115 dogs), 34 of them had fractures in the forearms bones. All these cases underwent surgical treatment through osteosynthesis with blood and external immobilization. We also treated cases of complications in healing these fractures after surgical treatment. The complications in the recovery of the fractures of the long bones in dogs are frequent. Above all they are first noticed in the bones of the forearm. Different problems might be identified such as’ mal joints, lack of joints, retarded joints and osteomyelitis. These because of the limited covering of the focus of the <b>fracture</b> <b>by</b> the soft tissues, lack of blood supply of the region {{as well as of the}} characteristic anatomo-topographic structure that this region has. Specifically the data that were taken into consideration included the period of recovery, the characteristics of the fracture, the type of surgical treatment and the final result. The fractures are often presented as closed fractures and less as transverse and oblique fractures. The most frequent treatment is the conservative one through external immobilization and in some cases of fractures of the radius the treatment was performed with endomedullar rods...|$|R

However, the orebodies show several metamorphic fea-tures typical of similar mineralizations described in the geologic literature, suggesting a preintrusive genesis of probably exhalative sedimentary nature. The sedimentary sequence consists of two formations: (1) the Aranaz limestones, dated as Namurian, and (2) a Westphalian sehistose formation, composed of pelitie, semipelitie, and psammitie rocks, with some eonglomeratie tuffs, albite-rieh laminae, tourmalinites, and in-terlayered basic sills.

40|$|Multiple myeloma, {{also called}} Kahler disease or {{myelomatosis}} is a debilitating and incurable malignancy characterized by proliferation of malignant plasma cells {{and an increased}} production of monoclonal paraproteins. In multiple myeloma, the abnormal proliferation of plasma cells within the bone marrow interferes with the production of blood cells therefor leading to anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia.

40|$|A {{subtalar}} dislocation of {{the foot}} is an uncommon injury, and cases of posterior subtalar dislocation are even rarer. This injury {{is characterized by a}} simultaneous dislocation of talocalcaneal and talonavicular joints while tibiotalar and calcaneocuboid articulations remain intact. Subtalar dislocation is commonly <b>accompanied</b> <b>by</b> <b>fractures</b> of the malleoli, talus, or fifth metatarsal and by a rotational component of the subtalar joint. Subtalar dislocation can occur in any direction and produces significant deformity. This article presents a case of pure posterior subtalar dislocation in an 80 -year-old man who presented with pain and deformity in his left ankle following a motorcycle accident. Radiographs demonstrated dislocation of both the talonavicular and talocalcaneal joints. The calcaneus was displaced posteriorly without medial or lateral displacement. No rotational component of the calcaneus was noted, suggesting the trauma was in pure hyperplantar flexion. We hypothesize that pure hyperplantar flexion could lead to a progressive subtalar ligament weakening that may result in a complete ligament rupture if the plantar flexion force is prolonged.
