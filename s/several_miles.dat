5|$|Dacite eruptions in the Lassen area {{typically}} {{begin with}} steam explosions {{caused by the}} interaction of rising magma with ground water. When dacite magma charged with volcanic gases reaches the surface, it erupts explosively, usually as a vertical column of gas and ash that can rise <b>several</b> <b>miles</b> into the atmosphere. Heavy fallback of hot ash and rock fragments from eruption columns may generate highly mobile pyroclastic flows that can rush <b>several</b> <b>miles</b> down a volcano's slopes and adjacent valleys. Fallout from the eruption column can blanket areas within a few miles (~8km) of the vent with {{a thick layer of}} pumice, and high-altitude winds may carry finer ash tens to hundreds of miles from the volcano, posing a hazard to flying aircraft, particularly those with jet engines.|$|E

Giemma's peer returned Francis to the Giemma's compound, where he was beaten with a bullwhip. Bok attempted to escape once again just two days later, when he fled in the opposite direction of his previous escape. He once again fled for <b>several</b> <b>miles,</b> this time keeping to the forest. He stopped for water at a local stream crossing, where he was spotted by Giemma who happened to be there as well. Giemma forced Francis back to his home, this time promising to kill him. Francis was beaten again, but Giemma chose not to kill him, as Francis had become too valuable to the family as a slave.|$|E

Fort Jackson was kept in service only as an inspection station for traffic crossing Long Bridge.|$|E
