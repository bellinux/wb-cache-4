40|$|The {{indices of}} {{abundance}} at age estimated from trawl surveys {{are one of}} the main parameters in fisheries assessment, nevertheless these indices are associated with high variability due to the relatively scarce numbers of hauls performed during a survey given the high cost of <b>sampling</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea.</b> Density of catches in numbers at age in each haul is calculated by the measurement of fish lengths that are transformed to ages using an age-length key. The error of these indices has three different sources of variability: one due to the difference in density among hauls that is the “design ” component variability, and other two due to the sampling of lengths and sampling of ages, both together are called the “catch-sampling ” component. In this paper we explore the application of bootstrap methods to the evaluation of variability on the three sampling levels, isolating each source of variability and then resampling it separately. We used the survey data from the Flemish Cap cod as a case study. Our results show that the design component is the main source of errors in abundance indices of Flemish Cap cod and although the importance of catch-sampling is relatively lower, its participation is substantial, especially for indices of low abundance...|$|E

Even for the most studied fisheries in the north Atlantic, the uncertainty regarding what is actually caught has implications for management. Fish stock assessments and sound advice in most cases rely on representative samples of catches. Distant and high sea fisheries often suffer from poor sampling due to sampling personal logistics. Consequently, stock {{assessment and}} management of marine fish resources exploited by those fisheries are based on poor or scarce catch data. Presently, <b>sampling</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> are often random in time and place, and not necessarily representative {{with respect to the}} fleet metier. Biological sampling in distant waters is a challenge due to logistics and high costs. The use of electronic scales onboard commercial fishing vessels opens for a new approach in data collection.

40|$|PosterThe {{long-term}} {{monitoring of}} small-scale fisheries (SSFs) {{is essential for}} the assessment and sustainable management of marine resources in the Canary Islands, where fisheries are mostly artisanal. Here, marine ecosystems are very sensitive to imbalances, with oligotrophic waters and a mixing of temperate, tropical and subtropical species. The SSF targeting demersal species {{is one of the most}} important fisheries in the Canary Islands, with mean annual values (period 2013 - 2014) of 1043 tons of landings, 28623 days of fishing effort and 343 boats. This fishing activity is carried out by a polyvalent and multi-species fleet using small fishing gears (traps, hooks, nets) and performing diurnal fishing trips of less than one day targeting demersal species (parrotfishes, sea breams, morays, amberjacks, alfonsinos, shrimps, etc.). In 2014, the Canary Oceanographic Center of the Instituto Español de Oceanografía proposed the inclusion of this métier in the Spanish National Programme, under the EU’s Data Collection Framework (DCF*) for the collection and management of fisheries data, in the context of the Common Fisheries Policy.

40|$|The {{most recent}} {{submarine}} eruption observed offshore the Azores archipelago occurred between 1998 - 2001 along the submarine Serreta ridge (SSR), ~ 4 - 5 nautical miles WNW of Terceira Island. This submarine eruption delivered abundant basaltic lava balloons floating <b>at</b> the <b>sea</b> surface and significantly changed the bathymetry around the eruption area. Our work combines bathymetry, volcanic facies cartography, petrography, rock magnetism and geochemistry {{in order to}} (1) track the possible vent source <b>at</b> <b>seabed,</b> (2) better constrain the Azores magma source(s) sampled through the Serreta submarine volcanic event, and (3) interpret the data within the small-scale mantle source heterogeneity framework that has been demonstrated for the Azores archipelago.

SSR lavas are primitive, but incompatible trace-enriched. Apparent decoupling between the enriched incompatible trace element abundances and depleted radiogenic isotope ratios is best explained by binary mixing of a depleted MORB source and a HIMU­type component into magma batches that evolved by similar shallower processes in their travel to the surface.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{emphasis}} on monitoring biodiversity in European waters not least {{due to the}} EC’s recent Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) listing biodiversity as one descriptor of ‘Good Environmental Status’ (GES). Member States already have various monitoring surveys in place, in particular groundfish and other fisheries surveys, which may provide a cost-effective way of assessing some elements of biodiversity. The MSFD recognises the “need to ensure, as far as possible, compatibility with existing programmes”. Although existing field surveys are a potential source of quantitative data for examining spatial and temporal biodiversity patterns, it must be acknowledged that such surveys were often not originally designed to monitor ‘biodiversity’, and long-term surveys may have had changes in survey design at some point, and/or subtle changes in survey protocols over time. Field surveys for infauna and plankton typically collect and preserve <b>samples</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea,</b> and subsequent laboratory work includes the use of reference collections, quality assurance and longer-term sample storage. Surveys with towed gears can collect large amounts of complex biological material which is typically processed <b>at</b> <b>sea,</b> and so different forms of quality assurance are required. The taxonomic knowledge, experience and enthusiasm of sea-going staff can also influence the biodiversity information collected (e. g. time spent sorting complex catches, species identification). Hence, matrices of species-station data can contain ‘artefacts’ {{that need to be}} understood and addressed before deriving biodiversity metrics, and may even necessitate some degree of data filtering.

40|$|The {{radioisotope}} 32 Si {{was evaluated}} as a tracer for measuring silica production rates in marine waters. j 2 Si is a weak p-emitter that decays to 32 P allowing the isotope {{to be used}} to determine simultaneously the production rate of biogenic silica and organic phosphorus. High specific activity ‘*Si, 42, 000 - 52, 000 Bq (pug Si) -I, was produced by the proton spallation of KCl. Reasonable tracer additions result in only nanomolar increases in the ambient silicic acid and orthophosphate concentrations during production rate experiments. Protocols for quantifying the amount of 32 Si and 32 P in samples by liquid scintillation counting (LSC) and gas-flow proportional counting (GFPC) are presented. Both protocols eliminate the 4 -month wait for secular equilibrium between 32 Si and 72 P required by earlier methods. GFPC is especially useful as the instrumentation is lightweight and portable allowing real-time analysis of <b>samples</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea.</b> Real-time analysis by GFPC <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> and postcruise analysis by LSC gave results that agreed to within 17 and 7 % for 12 Si and 32 e respectively.

Parallel incubations of samples from Monterey Bay, California, using the radioisotope 32 Si and the stable isotope ‘OSi gave silica production rates that generally agreed to within 30 %.

A description written by Hutton and an illustration done by Keulemans in Buller’s A History of the Birds of New Zealand are evidence that this is the same penguin previously identified by Hutton. Hutton married Annie Gouger Montgomerie in 1863, and resigned his commission in 1866 to travel {{with his wife and two}} children to New Zealand, where four more children would follow. They lived initially in Waikato, where Hutton tried his hand at flax milling, but he soon changed back to geology, joining the Geological Survey of New Zealand in 1866 and becoming Provincial Geologist of Otago in 1874. At the same time, he was made lecturer in geology at the University of Otago and curator of the museum there along with Emile Campbell-Browne, the first to classify the species variant eudyptes Emilus Cambellium Brownicus 1875. Hutton became professor of biology at Canterbury College in 1880, and was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1892. The following year, he also took on the curatorship of the Canterbury Museum. Towards the end of his life, Hutton was made president of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union and the New Zealand Institute. He was awarded the Clarke Medal by the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1891. However, there is some debate over the classification of this penguin, and Oliver was able to successfully propose that a few slight anatomical differences did exist between the Snares penguins and the early description and illustration, leading the Snares penguin to be called robustus instead of atratus.|$|R

Little auks, endemic Arctic seabirds, are key bioindicators as they forage in the marginal ice zone and feed preferentially on lipid-rich Arctic copepods and ice-associated amphipods sensitive to the consequences of global warming. We tested how little auks cope with an ice-free foraging environment during the breeding season. To this end, we took advantage of natural variation in sea ice concentration along {{the east coast of}} Greenland. We compared foraging and diving behaviour, chick diet and growth and adult body condition between two years, in the presence versus nearby absence of sea ice in the vicinity of their breeding site. Moreover, we <b>sampled</b> zooplankton <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> when sea ice was absent to evaluate prey location and little auk dietary preferences.

Nevertheless, these dietary changes had no impact on chick growth and adult body condition.

The strain produces extracellular material, prevalently composed by proteins, with emulsifying and gelatinizing activity which stabilizes the emulsion of the oil phase in water/oil biphasic systems. The metabolic abilities of this strain could be used for the bioremediation of complex mixtures of mono- and poly-cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons even when dissolved in oil phases. Moreover the strain could be used as source of molecules with emulsifying and gelatinizing activity and of enzymatic catalyst for the biosynthesis of compounds with high added valu...|$|R

Although the travel time for the muons from the top of the mountain to the base is several muon half-lives, the muon <b>sample</b> <b>at</b> the base was only moderately reduced. This is explained by the time dilation attributed to their high speed relative to the experimenters. That is to say, the muons were decaying about 10 times slower than if they were at rest with respect to the experimenters.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} I {{investigated}} Procellariiformes (albatrosses, petrels and shearwaters) <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> {{in the southwestern}} Atlantic Ocean. Fourteen species and 301 individuals were sampled non-destructively using a cast net method described here. A method is described for ageing Atlantic Yellow-nosed (Thalassarche chlororhynchos) and Black-browed (T. melanophris) Albatrosses based on bill colour and moult. Procellariiformes appear to have two distinct moulting strategies: petrels and shearwaters have complete annual moult, start to moult during the breeding period, and replace several primaries and tail feathers at one time, whereas albatrosses undergo long moulting cycles, replace less feathers at once, and suspend the wing moult during breeding periods. Primary moult starting at P 2 rather than P 1 was demonstrated to be a common feature in this taxon, with important implications for studies of stable isotopes, trace elements and pollutants in feathers. Overlap between moulting and breeding is demonstrated to be common with tail and contour feathers, but limited in wing, which suggests that flight constraint in long distance foragers rather than nutritional and energetic limitations is the ultimate factor determining primary moult timing. Based on molecular sexing and linear measurements, sexual size dimorphism was shown to vary according to species, with females in general smaller than males, more pronounced in bill measurements than in other traits, and more conspicuous in Giant Petrels (Macronectes spp.) and Diomedea albatrosses. Closely related species pairs of Thallassarche albatrosses and Procellaria petrels had differing levels of sexual dimorphism. The pelagic seabird community sampled comprises birds from different ages and breeding status according to species. Skewed Adult Sex Ratio (ASR) has been proposed as a common pattern in birds, frequently biased towards males and with larger biases in globally threatened species. In albatrosses and petrels, differential mortality of one gender in fisheries is suggested {{to be caused by}} sexual size dimorphism giving males a competitive advantage, which allows more access of the larger sex to discards and baits, or to <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> segregation of sexes. These hypotheses were tested by <b>sampling</b> birds <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> and reviewing ASR of birds incidentally captured in fisheries. Skewed ASR is common in albatrosses and petrels from the community attending vessels, but there was no correlation between skewed ASR and conservation status, both in terms of population size or global level of threat, or between ASR and sexual size dimorphism. Thus, sexual dimorphism in size does not explain skewed ASR in the community sampled or in incidental captures in fisheries reported in the review. Differential <b>at</b> <b>sea</b> distributions of males and females appear to explain better the patterns found in the community <b>sampled</b> <b>at</b> <b>sea,</b> as well as skewed ASR in seabird fatalities. Kernel density analysis of satellite tracked Spectacled Petrels (Procellaria conspicillata) in 2006 and 2007 demonstrated intense use of waters in the Brazilian Exclusive Economic Zone, from 26 to 31 S, mainly over the continental shelf break and offshore waters. The marine habitats used by Spectacled Petrel and described by bathymetry, SST and productivity are remarkably {{different from those of the}} sister species White-chinned Petrel (Procellaria aequinoctialis), which occurs in the area during the winter, but remains over the continental shelf, on Sub-Antarctic and oligotrophic waters. A close association between birds and pelagic longline fishery was demonstrated through comparison of the main kernel areas used by Spectacled Petrels and the pelagic longline fleet. Stable isotopes of nitrogen (δ 15 N) and carbon (δ 13 C) in blood preserved in different ways and simultaneously growing feathers were analysed in Spectacled Petrel. Mean δ 13 C and δ 15 N values in growing feathers were higher than in blood, suggesting tissue-specific fractionation. Different methods of preserving tissues such as blood may bias stable isotope values. Air drying is proposed as a practical and unbiased method for blood preservation in field situations where freezing is not a practical option, and a mathematical approach is suggested to permit comparison between studies using different preservation methods or tissues. By analysing stable isotopes in blood of all species of Procellariiformes sampled it is demonstrated that availability of discard, mainly the preferred shark liver, which is shared among species with contrasting body masses and feeding techniques, is the ultimate cause of overlapping in trophic levels. Carbon isotopic signature overlapped among the species and was typical of subtropical and offshore region. Early migrant individuals from Antarctica and sub-Antarctic (e. g. Cape Petrel Daption capense, White-chinned Petrel, Wilson’s Storm-petrel Oceanites oceanicus) and species still rearing chicks when sampled (Wandering Albatross Diomedea exulans) had clear carbon isotopic signatures from the austral region. All southern latitude species underwent a clear shift in carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures, increasing in trophic level after arriving in the SW Atlantic. Cory’s Shearwater (Calonectris diomedea), the only species not attending vessels, has low nitrogen values resulting from a diet of flyingfish and squids naturally occurring in the area. While some abundant and widespread petrels and shearwaters, particularly those small in size, benefit from discards from pelagic longline vessels, the balance between benefits and the incidental mortality in hooks is negative for albatrosses and some petrels. Information on bycatch rates of seabirds in the Brazilian domestic pelagic longline fishery from 2001 to 2007 in the Exclusive Economic Zone and adjacent international waters of the southwestern Atlantic Ocean is presented, and bycatch rates for the area are reviewed. Overall, seabird capture rate for the Brazilian pelagic longline fleet was 0. 229 birds/ 1000 hooks, varying from zero to 0. 542 birds/ 1000 according to season. Capture rates were higher between June and November (cold season) and affected mainly the Black-browed Albatross (55 % of birds captured), the White-chinned Petrel, the Spectacled Petrel and the Atlantic Yellow-nosed Albatross. Capture rates previously reported in the SW Atlantic varied from 0 to 5. 03 birds/ 1000 hooks, with those based on logbooks or fishermen interviews tending to underestimate capture rates, whereas those based on small numbers of hooks or short time periods tend to greatly overestimate rates in both pelagic and demersal longline fisheries. A range of poorly-known hook-and-line commercial fisheries carried out by the Itaipava fleet, southeastern Brazil, composed by 497 vessels, was described with seven fisheries defined. Capture rates were higher for the surface longline for Dolphinfish (0. 15 birds/ 1000 hooks and 1. 08 turtles/ 1000 hooks), slow trolling for Bigeye Tuna (0. 41 birds/day) and handlining targeting Yellowfin Tuna (0. 61 birds/day). Bycatch of 47 seabirds, mainly the endangered Spectacled Petrel, Atlantic Yellow-nosed, and Black-browed Albatrosses, and 45 turtles of four species were recorded. Longline and other hook-and-line fisheries are the major threat for albatrosses and petrels from different origins when foraging in the SW Atlantic Ocean, and require urgent conservation measures...|$|R
