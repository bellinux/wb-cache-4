5|$|Contrary to {{the flat}} {{appearance}} of the loudspeaker, all three panels are slightly curved along the vertical axis to improve quality. The panels themselves are flat, but obtain their curvature by being slightly bent to a curved backing. With the bipolar nature of the speaker emitting sound from both front and back surfaces as it does, {{the application of a}} felt sheet {{to the rear of the}} panels damps and absorbs high frequencies radiating from the back. A crossover network, set at 500Hz, remains necessary to adjust for back-to-front interference causing loss in output at low frequencies. In addition, the speaker should stand in free space to achieve optimum sound. The instructions book contains advice against placement of the speaker in corners or positions close to or parallel with walls, and further explains that a corner placement will adversely affect bass response and be detrimental to the midrange because of <b>standing</b> <b>waves</b> generated.|$|E
5|$|In {{this new}} role, he invented the Shive wave machine (also {{known as the}} Shive wave {{generator}}). The wave generator illustrates wave motion using a series of steel rods joined by a thin torsion wire which transmits energy from one rod to the next. The high moment of inertia of each rod ensures the wave takes several seconds to traverse the entire series of rods, making the dynamics easily visible. The motion is analogous to high-frequency waves that are invisible to the human eye, such as electromagnetic waves on a transmission line. The wave generator could illustrate wave reflection, <b>standing</b> <b>waves,</b> resonance, partial reflection, and impedance matching. Shive made two educational films in which he demonstrated the machine, Simple Waves and Similarities in Wave Behavior, and wrote a book with the same name as the latter.|$|E
50|$|In practice, {{losses in}} the {{transmission}} line and other components mean that a perfect reflection and a pure <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> are never achieved. The result is a partial <b>standing</b> <b>wave,</b> which is a superposition of a <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> and a traveling wave. The {{degree to which the}} wave resembles either a pure <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> or a pure traveling wave is measured by the <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> ratio (SWR).|$|R
5000|$|An {{impedance}} mismatch creates a reflected wave, which {{added to the}} incoming <b>waves</b> creates a <b>standing</b> <b>wave.</b> An {{impedance mismatch}} can be also quantified with the <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> ratio (SWR or VSWR for voltage), which {{is connected to the}} impedance ratio and reflection coefficient by: , where [...] are the minimum and maximum values of the voltage absolute value, and the VSWR is the voltage <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> ratio, which value of 1 denotes full transmission, without reflection and thus no <b>standing</b> <b>wave,</b> while very large values mean high reflection and <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> pattern.|$|R
50|$|A <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> is {{a special}} kind of wave that can occur in a {{resonator}}. In a resonator superposition of the incident and reflective wave occurs, causing a <b>standing</b> <b>wave.</b> Pressure and particle velocity are 90 degrees out of phase in a <b>standing</b> <b>wave.</b>|$|R
5|$|The dusky {{crag martin}} feeds mainly on insects caught in flight. When nesting, birds often fly {{back and forth}} near to a rock face or {{building}} hunting for their prey. This martin is more gregarious outside the breeding season, and may form small flocks where food is abundant. Vertical surfaces are preferred for hunting, and {{a study of the}} Eurasian crag martin, which has a similar foraging technique, showed that cliff faces generate <b>standing</b> <b>waves</b> in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas. The martin exploits the area close to the cliff when it hunts, relying on its high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns. When feeding young, foraging is concentrated on the profitable patches in the immediate vicinity of the nest, since there is a negative correlation between foraging distance and feeding rate.|$|E
5|$|The pale {{crag martin}} feeds mainly on insects caught in flight, {{although}} it will occasionally {{feed on the}} ground. Breeding birds often feed close to their nesting territory, flying back and forth along a rock face catching insects in their bills. Cliff faces generate <b>standing</b> <b>waves</b> in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas. Crag martins exploit the area close to the cliff when they hunt, relying on their high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns. When not breeding, they may also hunt low over open ground. The insects caught depend on what is locally available, but may include mosquitoes, flies, Hymenoptera, ants and beetles. This martin often feeds alone, but sizeable groups may gather at grass fires to feast on the fleeing insects, and outside the breeding season flocks of up to 300may form where food is abundant, such as agricultural areas, wetlands and sewage works. The pale crag martin drinks in flight as it skims the water surface, although {{at least some of}} its water requirement is obtained from the insects it consumes. Wintering hirundines of other species are not normally found in the dry, rocky areas in which the pale crag martin nests, so there is little competition for food.|$|E

40|$|Helium in the {{superfluid}} state emits copious {{amounts of}} radiation in the ultraviolet region when excited by an electron stream. Conventional laser action using mirrors is impossible in superfluid helium {{because there are}} no mirrors that will reflect VUV radiation. By utilizing the distributed feedback method, the superfluid helium can be made to lase. By setting up a <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> in superfluid helium that has a wavelength equal to, or harmonically related to, half the wavelength of the photon radiation chosen to be emitted as laser radiation by the superfluid helium, the need for end mirrors to produce reflection of the laser radiation is eliminated and reflection occurs instead at the wavefronts of the <b>standing</b> <b>wave.</b> The photons leave the superfluid helium at right angles to the <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> as coherent radiation having a very high intensity. The <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> established in the superfluid helium may be an acoustical <b>standing</b> <b>wave,</b> a thermal <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> (second sound), or an electric <b>standing</b> <b>wave...</b>|$|R

40|$|Journals {{published}} by the American Physical Society {{can be found at}} [URL] subwavelength localization of an ensemble of atoms concentrated to a small volume in space is investigated. The localization relies on the interaction of the ensemble with a <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> laser field. The light scattered in the interaction of the <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> field and the atom ensemble depends on the position of the ensemble relative to the <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> nodes. This relation can be described by a fluorescence intensity profile, which depends on the <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> field parameters and the ensemble properties and which is modified due to collective effects in the ensemble of nearby particles. We demonstrate that the intensity profile can be tailored to suit different localization setups. Finally, we apply these results to two localization schemes.

Second, we discuss localization of an ensemble passing through the <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> field...|$|R

5000|$|Anomalous {{absorption}} effects {{take place}} {{due to a}} <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> patterns of two wave fields. Absorption is stronger if the <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> has its anti-nodes on the lattice planes, i.e. where the absorbing atoms are, and weaker, if the anti-nodes are shifted between the planes. The <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> shifts from one condition to the other {{on each side of}} the Darwin plateau which gives the latter an asymmetric shape.|$|R

The frequency at which the <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> can be produced is largely dependent on the physical dimensions of the box and the wavelength of the wave.

40|$|Abstract: The ideal Gaussian <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> {{field model}} and the Gaussian <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> field model under the {{condition}} of straight edge diffraction disturbance were established, and computer simulation and numerical analysis were done to the two kinds of models. It is concluded that the center position of Chromium atomic sedimentary grating in the straight edge diffraction disturbance <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> will be away from the diffraction edge; near the given ideal deposit position, the PTVH(Peak to Valley Height) of Chromium atomic sedimentary grating in the ideal <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> is higher than that in the straight edge diffraction disturbance <b>standing</b> <b>wave,</b> and the FWHM(Full Width at Half Maximum) is also narrower than in the ideal standing wave; for the exist of straight edge diffraction {{the size of the}} acceptable sedimentary pattern will be smaller, which has theoretical guidance on the practical operation...|$|R

40|$|A {{scheme for}} sub-wavelength {{position}} measurements of quantum particles is discussed, which operates with running-wave laser fields {{as opposed to}} <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> fields proposed in previous setups. The position is encoded in the phase of the applied fields {{rather than in the}} spatially modulated intensity of a <b>standing</b> <b>wave.</b> Therefore, disadvantages of <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> schemes such as cases where the atom remains undetected since it is at a node of the <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> field are avoided. Reversing the directions of parts of the driving laser fields allows to switch between different magnification levels, and thus to optimize the localization. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
25|$|The {{stationary}} wave {{can be viewed}} as the sum of two traveling sinusoidal waves of oppositely directed velocities. Consequently, wavelength, period, and wave velocity are related just as for a traveling wave. For example, the speed of light can be determined from observation of <b>standing</b> <b>waves</b> in a metal box containing an ideal vacuum.|$|E
25|$|The {{hemispherical}} resonator gyroscope (HRG), {{also called}} wine-glass gyroscope or mushroom gyro, makes using a thin solid-state hemispherical shell, anchored by a thick stem. This shell is driven to a flexural resonance by electrostatic forces generated by electrodes which are deposited directly onto separate fused-quartz structures {{that surround the}} shell. Gyroscopic effect is obtained from the inertial property of the flexural <b>standing</b> <b>waves.</b>|$|E
25|$|Vertical {{harmonic}} motion results, producing an impulse that travels {{the length of}} the basin at a velocity that depends on the depth of the water. The impulse is reflected back {{from the end of the}} basin, generating interference. Repeated reflections produce <b>standing</b> <b>waves</b> with one or more nodes, or points, that experience no vertical motion. The frequency of the oscillation is determined by the size of the basin, its depth and contours, and the water temperature.|$|E

30|$|The {{results in}} Sect.  3.1 show that {{transmission}} delays do not destabilize <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> front. In contrast, nonlocal feedback delays may destabilize <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> front for certain delays resulting to oscillatory activity. The corresponding analytical {{conditions for a}} single delay hold for feedback connections in class (C), i.e., for local inhibition–lateral excitation interactions. Since such synaptic couplings as well as feedback delays are omnipresent in the brain, oscillatory <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> front may occur frequently in real neural structures. For distributed delays, such instability may be possible, but no analytical method is known up to today proving oscillatory instability. Nevertheless, numerical simulations of <b>standing</b> <b>wave</b> front subject to distributed feedback delays reveal oscillatory instability as well.|$|R
