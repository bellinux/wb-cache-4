5|$|The {{exterior}} of the observatory building has a brick cornice, with stone sills and lintels, stone water course, ornamental gutters, and original copper downspouts. Most of the building's windows are of the wooden double-hung variety and original, as are the front entrance door transom and concrete <b>stoop.</b> The original front balustrade has been replaced, however, the western <b>stoop</b> and ornamental iron balustrade is still original.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the main}} façade's first- and second-story windows and the {{entrance}} are adorned with white wooden label moldings. The main entrance is composed of a tall double wooden entrance door, with its original handle and locks. Each door consists of four vertical wooden panels. A rectangular transom light of four vertical glass panels tops the main entryway's double wooden doors. Outside the entryway is a spacious brick <b>stoop</b> that is accessed by a cement walkway from West Main Street. Its brick steps {{leading up to the}} <b>stoop</b> were last restored in the late 1970s.|$|E

40|$|Existing biomechanical {{evidence}} suggests mechanisms of low back injuries and disorders associated with prolonged <b>stooping.</b> However, no research has tested realistic and more natural <b>stooped</b> work conditions with human {{subjects in the}} investigation of the biomechanical responses of the low back in prolonged <b>stooping.</b> The current study was aimed to explore various biomechanical responses of the low back in more realistic and work-related loading and posture conditions of prolonged <b>stooping.</b> Twenty two subjects performed <b>stooped</b> work tasks for 7 min with periodic micro-breaks in upright standing, and various measures for assessing biomechanical responses of the low back were obtained before, during and immediately after the <b>stooped</b> work period. Study results found significant increases (p < 0. 05) in the range of lumbar flexion and myoelectric activation of the low back muscles after the <b>stooped</b> work period. During <b>stooped</b> work, the low back extensor muscles did not show flexion-relaxation. It could be concluded that the natural and unrestricted <b>stooped</b> work conditions produced similar viscoelastic responses of the low back to what more severe <b>stooping</b> conditions with posture restrictions did in previous research, but could be more fatigue-prone due to low but consistent activation of the low back extensor muscles during <b>stooped</b> work activities. close 0...|$|R

5|$|Ferguson died in Brooklyn of {{apoplexy}} {{at the age}} of 49. Initially {{buried in}} the Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn, he was later reinterred in Cypress Hills Cemetery, also in the borough of Brooklyn. Despite his career that was filled with incidents of turmoil between him and his players and other baseball people, his funeral, which was held at his home, was quickly crowded, as was the front <b>stoop.</b> Eventually, they had to turn people away.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 19th century, as salvage {{operations}} became deeper and longer, an unexplained malady began afflicting the divers; they would suffer breathing difficulties, dizziness, joint pain and paralysis, sometimes leading to death. The problem was already well known among workers building tunnels and bridge footings operating under pressure in caissons and was initially called caisson disease; {{it was later}} renamed the bends because the joint pain typically caused the sufferer to <b>stoop.</b> Early reports of the disease had been made {{at the time of}} Charles Pasley's salvage operation, but scientists were still ignorant of its causes.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Toronto, and Hamilton, Ontario, Canada from September 5-December 8, 2006. Hairspray is explicitly set in Baltimore, Maryland and the original 1988 film had been shot on location there, but the 2007 film was shot primarily in Toronto because the city was better equipped with the sound stages necessary to film a musical. The opening shots of the descent from the clouds and the newspaper being dropped onto the <b>stoop</b> are the only times that the actual city of Baltimore {{is shown in the}} film.|$|E

40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that prolonged exposure to <b>stooped</b> work {{is associated with}} the development of low back disorders, particularly those that affect the spinal intervertebral discs. While several studies have been done to analyze the biomechanical aspects of <b>stooped</b> work, very little research has focused on the effect of prolonged <b>stooped</b> work on disc hydration- a critical component of disc health. This study explores the connection between <b>stooped</b> work and low back pain through controlled mechanical loading and quantitative analysis of disc hydration during in vitro simulated <b>stooped</b> and erect loading conditions of porcine discs. The results showed that <b>stooped</b> postures exhibit significantly decreased overall water content relative to erect postures. These results have implications for the injury mechanisms associated with <b>stooped</b> work, as disc hydration forms the foundation for overall disc health and proper function...|$|R

On 9 June, Wimbledon announced that Robson received a wildcard for the Ladies' Singles event at the 2009 Wimbledon Championships. She faced former world No. 5 and 2002 Wimbledon quarterfinalist Daniela Hantuchová in the first round but lost despite being a break up in the second set. She also entered into the doubles tournament with Georgie <b>Stoop,</b> progressing to the second round before losing to sixteenth seeds Svetlana Kuznetsova and Amélie Mauresmo. As well as Wimbledon, she competed in two ITF tournaments, one via a wildcard and the second via qualification, but lost in the first round of each.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of captive breeding methods {{has led to}} peregrines being commercially available for falconry use, thus mostly eliminating the need to capture wild birds for support of falconry. The main reason for taking wild peregrines {{at this point is}} to maintain healthy genetic diversity in the breeding lines. Hybrids of peregrines and gyrfalcons are also available that can combine the best features of both species to create what many consider to be the ultimate falconry bird for the taking of larger game such as the sage-grouse. These hybrids combine the greater size, strength, and horizontal speed of the gyrfalcon with the natural propensity to <b>stoop</b> and greater warm weather tolerance of the peregrine.|$|E
5|$|During {{the run of}} Iolanthe, in 1883, Sullivan was knighted by Queen Victoria. Although it was the operas with Gilbert {{that had}} earned him the {{broadest}} fame, the honour was conferred for his services to serious music. The musical establishment, and many critics, believed that this should {{put an end to}} his career as a composer of comic opera—that a musical knight should not <b>stoop</b> below oratorio or grand opera. Sullivan, despite the financial security of writing for the Savoy, increasingly viewed his work with Gilbert as unimportant, beneath his skills, and repetitious. Furthermore, he was unhappy that he had to simplify his music to ensure that Gilbert's words could be heard. But paradoxically, in February 1883, just after Iolanthe opened, Sullivan had signed a five-year agreement with Gilbert and Carte requiring him to produce a new comic opera on six months' notice.|$|E

5|$|The {{forensic}} {{examination of}} the lead pipes found {{at the murder scene}} and in the Corsair's boot revealed traces of blood on the pipe from 46Lower Belgrave Street. This proved to be a mixture of Lady Lucan's (blood group A) and Sandra Rivett's (B) blood. Hair belonging to Veronica Lucan was also found on that pipe, but none belonging to Sandra Rivett. The pipe found inside the car had neither blood nor hair on it. Home Office scientists were unable to prove conclusively that both pipes were cut from the same, longer, piece of piping, although they thought it likely. The tape wrapped around both was similar, but those too could not be conclusively linked. The letters written to Bill Shand-Kydd were stained with blood considered to be from both women. The letter to Michael <b>Stoop</b> had no blood on it, but it was later proven that the paper it was written on had been torn from a writing pad found in the Corsair's boot.|$|E
5|$|The pair {{defends the}} chosen nest site against other peregrines, and often against ravens, herons, and gulls, and if ground-nesting, also such mammals as foxes, wolverines, felids, bears, wolves, and {{mountain}} lions. Both nests and (less frequently) adults are predated by larger-bodied raptorial birds like eagles, large owls, or gyrfalcons. The most serious predators of peregrine nests in North America and Europe are the {{great horned owl}} and the Eurasian eagle owl. When reintroductions have been attempted for peregrines, the most serious impediments were these two owls routinely picking off nestlings, fledglings and adults by night. Peregrines defending their nests have managed to kill raptors as large as golden eagles and bald eagles (both of which they normally avoid as potential predators) that have come {{too close to the}} nest by ambushing them in a full <b>stoop.</b> In one instance, when a snowy owl killed a newly fledged peregrine, the larger owl was in turn killed by a stooping peregrine parent.|$|E
5|$|The {{peregrine}} falcon {{is a highly}} admired falconry bird, and {{has been used in}} falconry for more than 3,000 years, beginning with nomads in central Asia. Its advantages in falconry include not only its athleticism and eagerness to hunt, but an equitable disposition that leads to it being one of the easier falcons to train. The {{peregrine falcon}} has the additional advantage of a natural flight style of circling above the falconer ("waiting on") for game to be flushed, and then performing an effective and exciting high speed diving <b>stoop</b> to take the quarry. The speed and energy of the <b>stoop</b> allows the falcon to catch fast flying birds, and to deliver a knock out blow with a fist-like clenched talon against game that may be much larger than itself. Additionally the versatility of the species, with agility allowing capture of smaller birds and a strength and attacking style allowing capture of game much larger than themselves, combined with the wide size range of the many peregrine subspecies, means there is a subspecies suitable to almost any size and type of game bird. This size range, evolved to fit various environments and prey species, is from the larger females of the largest subspecies to the smaller males of the smallest subspecies, approximately five to one (approximately 1500g to 300g). The males of smaller and medium-sized subspecies, and the females of the smaller subspecies, excel in the taking of swift and agile small game birds such as dove, quail, and smaller ducks. The females of the larger subspecies are capable of taking large and powerful game birds such as the largest of duck species, pheasant, and grouse.|$|E

40|$|Previously, {{responses}} to <b>stooping</b> or static upper body flexion {{have been evaluated}} by quantifying {{the changes in the}} range of lumbar flexion after a bout of <b>stooping</b> with restricted and controlled posture conditions. The current study was aimed to confirm the same with unrestricted posture conditions that resembled work-related postures. Twenty two subjects performed <b>stooping</b> work tasks for 6 minutes with intermediate short breaks, followed by a 6 -min upright standing recovery period. Time-dependent changes in the range of lumbar flexion were evaluated by measuring peak lumbar flexion angle in full flexion trials and <b>stooping</b> postures before, during and after the <b>stooping</b> period. Results found a significant increase (p< 0. 05) in the peak lumbar flexion angle after <b>stooping,</b> and the increased range of lumbar flexion did not return to its pre-stooping level after the recovery period. Short breaks during <b>stooping</b> moderated the increase in the flexion range, resulting in a smaller increase in the flexion range compared to what static and controlled full flexion postures have produced in previous research...|$|R
5|$|Ryu fights back to {{the inner}} {{chambers}} of the Ancient Ship of Doom, where he prepares {{to engage in the}} final showdown against Clancy, who has now transmuted into a super bio-noid. Clancy offers Ryu to have him and Irene work for him by his side wipe out the human race and usher a new age, but Ryu refuses and commences with the final battle. After transforming twice into progressively-stronger versions of himself, Clancy is defeated by Ryu, and Ryu is transported outside the warship and back to Irene; they both watch as the Ancient Ship of Doom is brought down and explodes, and they witness the crumbling of Castle Rock fortress. In the aftermath, Ryu tells Irene that Clancy's and Foster's plan have been foiled, and that mankind will live on and refuse to be part of anyone's evil plans; he adds that mankind would never <b>stoop</b> to a level in which they would completely destroy themselves out of mere ambition. The two watch as the sun rises and as a new day begins.|$|E
5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Danielle Federici, was filmed {{during the early}} summer of 1994. It was filmed in black-and-white, and features Carey walking along the streets of New York, watching several different people, ranging from a small child to an elderly man, lonely {{and in need of}} a friend. Additionally, aside from several scenes of Carey and a large church choir in a large antechamber, the video is known as the first video in which Carey appears with straightened hair. Throughout her career up until that point, Carey had famously sported long, auburn curls. However, the video presented Carey's first image makeover, where she appears with bangs and a long straightened hairstyle. The video begins with scenes of Carey walking down a long New York street, with the addition of close ups of Carey's face. As she stares down the road, she witnesses a small girl, sitting alone in an alley corner, glaring into the sky. As the first chorus begins, Carey enters a large foyer, with a choir dressed in black singing perched atop a large staircase. During the second verse, she similarly witnesses an older man, who is sitting on a withered <b>stoop.</b>|$|E
