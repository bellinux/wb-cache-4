Each junction forms a switch and the junction has a functional dimension in nanometers.

If a {{positive}} <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> and negative <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> travel different physical paths to the amplifier input then {{the differences in}} induced currents will arrive at the amplifier input terminals as differences which will be amplified.

Two popular methods include using coaxial wire (both conductors have the same axis of rotation everywhere they exist, and thus have similar inductive experiences), and twisted pair where the two conductors have the same axis of rotation (but don't always exist in the same path).|$|R

In particular, thin-walled drift tubes ("straws"), which are currently being attached to large detector units of several tens of square meters of surface, need to be equipped with wire locators along their <b>signal</b> <b>wires.</b> A wire locator has been developed together with an insertion device, especially for medium-sized drift tube systems, which significantly reduces the production time and avoids the danger of applying epoxy glue to the <b>signal</b> <b>wire.</b> The wire locator is being inserted in one single time-saving production step together with the <b>signal</b> <b>wire</b> itself. The proposed design is being compared to the rigid wire locators in use in the COMPASS straw tracking system at CERN. The investigation comprises both wire- centering capability and influence on the efficiency of adjacent detector regions, demonstrating the competitive performance of the proposed new system. Its sufficient mechanical reliability could be shown by means of an X-ray tomography; the attractively small influence on the drift field was determined in a test measurement using a silicon tracking system in a hadron beam.

40|$|A {{fabrication}} {{process has been}} developed for fully planarized Nb-based superconducting inter-layer connections (vias) with minimum size down to 250 nm for superconductor very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuits with 8 and 10 superconducting layers on 200 -mm wafers. Instead of single Nb <b>wiring</b> <b>layers,</b> it utilizes Nb/Al/Nb trilayers for each <b>wiring</b> <b>layer</b> to form Nb pillars (studs) providing vertical connections between the wires etched in the bottom layer of the trilayer and the next <b>wiring</b> <b>layer</b> that is also deposited as a Nb/Al/Nb trilayer. This technology makes possible {{a dramatic increase in}} the density of superconducting digital circuits by reducing the area of interconnects with respect to presently utilized etched contact holes between superconducting layers and by enabling the use of stacked vias. Results on the fabrication and size dependence of electric properties of Nb studs with dimensions near the resolution limit of 248 -nm photolithography are presented in the normal and superconducting states. Superconducting critical current density in the fabricated stud-vias is about 0. 3 A/μm 2 and approaches the depairing current density of Nb films. Comment: 13 pages, 11 figures, 24 references.
