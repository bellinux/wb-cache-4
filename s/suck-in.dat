5000|$|Dashboard uses {{a variety}} of {{graphical}} effects for displaying, opening, and using widgets. For instance, a 3-D flip effect is used to simulate the widget flipping around, by clicking on a small i icon in the right bottom corner, the user can change the preferences on the reverse side; other effects include crossfading and scaling from icon to body (when opening widgets), a [...] "spin cycle effect" [...] when a widget is focused and the user presses Command-R or a <b>suck-in</b> effect when they are closed. On sufficiently powered Macs, widgets will produce a ripple effect when they are opened, like a leaf falling onto water. These effects consume considerable processing power and are arguably merely cosmetic, but {{with the help of}} Mac OS X’s Quartz Extreme and Core Image graphics architectures, sufficient computing power to render them in real time is available. As with Exposé, Front Row and the minimise effect, holding shift down while calling the Dashboard or opening the Dashboard menu bar will display the effect in slow motion.|$|E
50|$|During {{the course}} of the L-2000-2's development, the engine {{previously}} selected by Lockheed was no longer deemed acceptable. During the time frame between the L-2000-1 and L-2000-2, Pratt and Whitney designed a new afterburning turbofan called the JTF-17A, which produced greater amounts of thrust. General Electric developed the GE4 which was an afterburning turbojet with variable guide-vanes, which was actually the less powerful of the two at sea level, but produced more power at high altitudes. Both engines required some degree of afterburner during cruise. Lockheed's design favored the JTF-17A over the GE-4, but there was the risk that GE would win the engine competition and Lockheed would win the SST contract, so they developed new engine pods that could accommodate either engine. Aerodynamic modifications allowed a shorter engine pod to be used and which utilized a new inlet design. This inlet featured minimal external cowl angles and was precisely contoured to allow a high-pressure recovery using no moving parts, and allowed maximum performance with either engine option. To allow additional airflow for noise-reduction, or to aid afterburner performance, a set of <b>suck-in</b> doors was added to the rear portion of the pod. To provide mid-air braking capability for rapid deceleration and rapid descents, and to assist ground braking, part of the nozzle could be employed as a thrust reverser at speeds below Mach 1.2. The pods were also repositioned on the new wing to better shield them from abrupt changes in airflow.|$|E
40|$|A positron-beam {{interacting}} with the plasma electrons drives radial <b>suck-in,</b> in contrast to an electron-beam driven blow-out in the over-dense regime, $n_b>n_ 0 $. In a homogeneous plasma, the electrons are radially sucked-in from all the different radii. The electrons collapsing from different radii do not simultaneously compress on-axis driving weak fields. A hollow-channel allows electrons from its channel-radius to collapse simultaneously exciting coherent fields. We analyze the optimal channel radius. Additionally, the low ion density in the hollow allows a larger region with focusing phase which we show is linearly focusing. We have shown {{the formation of an}} ion-wake channel behind a blow-out electron bubble-wake. Here we explore positron acceleration in the over-dense regime comparing an optimal hollow-plasma channel to the ion-wake channel. The condition for optimal hollow-channel radius is also compared. We also address the effects of a non-ideal ion-wake channel on positron-beam excited fields.

40|$|The {{excitation}} of a non-linear ion-wake by a {{train of}} ultra-relativistic electron bubble wake [1]-[8] is modeled. The ion-wake {{is shown to}} be a driven non-linear ion-acoustic wave {{in the form of a}} cylindrical ion-soliton [11]-[14]. The phases of the oscillating radial electric fields of the slowly-propagating [21] electron bubble is asymmetric in time and excites time-averaged inertial ion motion radially. The electron compression in the back of the bubble <b>sucks-in</b> the ions and the space-charge within the bubble cavity expels them, driving a cylindrical ion-soliton structure with on-axis and bubble-edge density-spikes [5][6]. Once formed, the channel-edge density-spike is driven radially outwards by the thermal pressure of the wake energy [12]. Its channel-like structure due to the flat-residue left behind by the propagating ion-soliton, is independent of the energy-source driving the bubble [3][4] electron wake. We explore the use of the partially- filled channel formed by the cylindrical ion-soliton for a novel regime of positron acceleration [18]. OSIRIS PIC [25] simulations are used to study the ion-wake soliton structure, its driven propagation and its use for positron acceleration...|$|R
40|$|A {{model for}} the {{excitation}} of a non-linear ion-wake mode by a train of plasma electron oscillations in the non-linear time-asymmetric regime is developed using analytical theory and particle-in-cell based computational solutions. The ion-wake is {{shown to be a}} driven non-linear ion-acoustic wave {{in the form of a}} cylindrical ion-soliton. The near-void and radially-outwards propagating ion-wake channel of a few plasma skin-depth radius, is explored for application to "Crunch-in" regime of positron acceleration. The coupling from the electron wakefield mode to the ion-mode dictates the long-term evolution of the plasma and the time for its relaxation back to an equilibrium, limiting the repetition-rate of a plasma accelerator. Using an analytical model it is shown that it is the time asymmetric phases of the oscillating radial electric fields of the nearly-stationary electron bubble that excite time-averaged inertial ion motion radially. The electron compression in the back of the bubble <b>sucks-in</b> the ions whereas the space-charge within the bubble cavity expels them, driving a cylindrical ion-soliton structure with on-axis and bubble-edge density-spikes. Once formed, the channel-edge density-spike is sustained over the length of the plasma and driven radially outwards by the thermal pressure of the wake energy in electrons. Its channel-like structure is independent of the energy-source, electromagnetic wave or particle beam, driving the bubble electron wake. Particle-In-Cell simulations are used to study the ion-wake soliton structure, its driven propagation and its use for positron acceleration in the "Crunch-in" regime. Comment: Crunch-in regime strongly contradicts the established conclusions of ZERO focusing fields in a hollow-channel (claimed and presented in several PRL, PoP, PRE and Nature papers). Since this entirely opposes and goes against established conclusions of over 20 years old work, severely damaging to the reputations of the senior physicists, it is not being allowed through the peer-review proces...|$|R
40|$|Piston cores {{collected}} from IODP drilling platforms (and its predecessors) {{provide the best}} long-term geological and climatic record of marine sediments worldwide. Coring disturbances affecting the original sediment texture have been recognized {{since the early days}} of coring, and include deformation resulting from shear of sediment against the core barrel, basal flow-in due to partial stroke, loss of stratigraphy, fall-in, sediment loss through core catchers, and structures formed during core recovery and on-deck transport. The most severe disturbances occur in non-cohesive (sandy) facies, which are particularly common in volcanogenic environments and submarine fans. Although all of these types of coring disturbances have been recognized previously, our contribution is novel because it provides an easily accessible summary of methods for their identification. This contribution gives two specific examples on the importance of these coring disturbances. We show how <b>suck-in</b> of sediments during coring artificially created very thick volcaniclastic sand layers in cores offshore Montserrat and Martinique (Lesser Antilles). We then analyze very thick, structureless sand layers from the Escanaba Trough inferred to be a record of the Missoula mega-floods. These sand layers tend to coincide with the base of core sections, and their facies suggest coring disturbance by basal flow-in, destroying the original structure and texture of the beds. We conclude by outlining and supporting IODP-led initiatives to further reduce and identify coring disturbances, and acknowledge their recent successes in drilling challenging sand-rich settings, such as during IODP Expedition 340...|$|E
40|$|Major {{fluctuations}} in paleomagnetic directions were commonly observed from long-core measurements of sediments recovered during ODP Leg 160. The recovered sediments display large-scale variations in magnetic remanence intensity {{partly because of}} the presence of magnetically "enhanced " sapropels. The pass-through long-core measurement is highly sensitive to large changes in remanence intensities. Significant discrepancies between the results obtained from discrete samples and long-core measurements indicate that it is necessary to determine whether the measured magnetic signal arises from geomagnetic field behavior, coring-induced overprints, or artifacts of the long-core measurement. Results of experiments designed to distin-guish between these possibilities suggest that there are several factors responsible for the observations. Coring-induced over-prints do not appear to be a significant problem: they are usually easily removed at low alternating fields (AFs). In some cases, particularly in the lower part of the record at Site 963, remagnetization is evident in intervals where sediment <b>suck-in</b> occurred during piston coring. The sediments in these intervals have stable and intense nearly vertical magnetizations, probably acquired within the core barrel or drill string. These zones are relatively rare, however, and do not account for many of the observed problems. Discrepancies between the paleomagnetic directions obtained from discrete samples and long-core measurements indicate that major intensity changes are a likely cause of some of the anomalous paleomagnetic directions in the long-core data. Our experiments therefore verify that large-scale remanence intensity changes reduce the usefulness of the pass-throug...|$|E
40|$|A maxillary {{obturator}} for the edentulous patient {{must be as}} lightweight {{as possible}} and provide for retention, stability, patient comfort, and cleanliness. The weight of a maxillary obturator is often a dislocat-ing factor. Patients who have hollow obturators may complain of food, fluid, and mucous accumulations that result in bad odors and altered taste sensation. This tip describes a simple, quick technique for using an autopolymerizing resin to convert an existing hol-low obturator into a hollow bulb (Fig. 1). PROCEDURE 1. Use utility wax to fill in and shape the bulb por-tion of the obturator (Fig. 2). 2. Use impression plaster to fabricate a matrix of the obturator bulb (Fig. 3). 3. Remove the utility wax, and relieve the area where bonding with autopolymerizing resin will take place. Make dovetail groves with an inverted cone bur for added retention. Wet the obturator area with fresh monomer. 4. Place mixed autopolymerizing acrylic resin into the matrix, making sure the acrylic touches and coats all surfaces of the matrix (Fig. 4). 5. Firmly place the prosthesis into the matrix, keeping the lid side down. Allow ample time for it to cure with a rubber band wrapped firmly around the prosthesis and matrix (Fig. 5). Use the unused portion of the autopolymerizing acrylic as a gauge for determining when the acrylic has set. It is crucial that the obturator not be placed in warm water or a pressure pot during curing. Heat will cause the gas inside the bulb to expand and push through the seal, cre-ating a hole; a pressure pot will cause the gas to shrink, creating a <b>suck-in</b> defect that will disrupt the bulb’s seal. 6. On curing, remove the prosthesis and trim the flash. Pumish, polish, and deliver the prosthesi...|$|E
