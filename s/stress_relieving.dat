In this paper, results of fracture toughness testing performed on manual metal arc weld metal in the as-welded and <b>stress</b> <b>relieved</b> conditions are compared. Tests were performed on standard 25 mm thick compact tension specimens machined from nominally 100 mm thick weldments manufactured using basic coated Fortrex 35 A consumables and C-Mn steel parent plate. The baseline for the dependence of fracture toughness on temperature was established by performing tests on <b>stress</b> <b>relieved</b> weld metal as a function of temperature. A comparison between the fracture toughness of as-welded and <b>stress</b> <b>relieved</b> weld metals was made by testing specimens from the same weld at 200 °C.

40|$|The contour {{method has}} been used to assess the level of {{residual}} stress generated during the post extrusion air cool and water quenching of a Ti- 6 Al- 4 V extruded bar. A length of the extrudate was transversally sectioned using electrical discharge machining (EDM), resulting in minimal damage to the cut surface; the <b>stress</b> <b>relieved</b> profile present at the cut surface was then measured using a coordinate measuring machine (CMM). The cut section was recreated in an ABAQUS finite element (FE) model and the inverse of the <b>stress</b> <b>relieved</b> profile recorded by CMM was applied as a boundary condition; by forcing the model’s surface topology to match the measured cut surface, residual stresses normal, i. e. longitudinal stresses, to the cut surface of the extruded profile were then calculated.

A max speed capability of at least 6000 - 8000-RPM is recommended. Equally important is tight vibrator motor speed regulation (±0.25%), which greatly improves the ability to detect and drive the resonance(s) (abilities that are required for <b>stress</b> <b>relieving</b> to occur). Driving a resonance involves tuning the vibrator speed {{to the top of}} the resonance peak. This is increasingly challenging as workpiece rigidity increases, which causes resonances to become very narrow. To record such resonances, a slow, automated scan through the speed range and plotting of the vibration response of the workpiece is made.|$|E
50|$|Mad Dog Knives makes {{tactical}} fixed-blade knives, originally using Starrett 496-O1 {{high carbon}} tool steel and later switching to Precision Marshall Presco American Made 01, which {{is given a}} proprietary heat treatment.

As a result, the blades have an edge hardness of 62-63 on the Rockwell C scale whereas the tip, spine, and tang have a Rockwell hardness of 50-54. This heat treatment was devised to develop phenomenal edge retention while preventing tip breakage and maintaining a degree of flexibility on the softer spine to improve the toughness of the knife.

50|$|Authentic paint craquelure {{occurs because}} paint dries and becomes less {{flexible}} as it ages and shrinks. In {{the case of}} paintings on canvas, the canvas slackens as it ages as it cannot endure the long-term stress of stretching. Paint {{at the center of}} a painting is the least cracked, whereas paint at the edges is the most cracked, or stressed. The precise pattern of craquelure depends on where, when, and under what conditions the picture was painted, and subsequently kept. Cracks caused by stretching or slackening the canvas are quite different from cracks due to other factors, such as drying and ageing of the paint. The paint cracks when the stress upon it is greater than the breaking stress point of the paint layer and the paint will crack approximately at right-angles to the direction of the <b>stress,</b> <b>relieving</b> that stress.
