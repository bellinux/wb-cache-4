40|$|Many {{applications}} of ReBCO coated conductors contain <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> pancake coils. In {{order to reduce}} their high AC loss, {{it is necessary to}} understand the loss mechanisms. In this article, we measure and simulate the AC loss and the critical current, I_c, in <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> pancake coils ("pancakes"). We construct <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> up to 4 pancakes and we measure them by electrical means. We also obtain the anisotropic field dependence of J_c from I_c measurements of the tape. This J_c is the only input to the simulations, together with the coil dimensions. After validating our computations with the measurements, we simulate <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> many pancakes, up to 32. We found that the AC loss in a <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> (four) pancakes is very high, two orders of magnitude larger than for a single tape. A double pancake behaves as a single one with double width but a <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> more pancakes is very different. Finally, we found that a 2 -strand Roebel cable reduces the AC loss in a <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> pancakes but not in a single pancake. In conclusion, the AC loss in <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> pancakes is too high. However, our simulations are useful to predict the AC loss and optimise the coil design, reducing the AC loss.
