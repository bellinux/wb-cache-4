5|$|Defensively, the Virginia Tech Hokies {{allowed an}} average of 308 yards per game and 18.4 points per game. During {{the last two games}} of the regular season, however, the Hokies {{permitted}} 34 points and 42 points to Rutgers and Virginia, respectively. The Virginia Tech defense was led by two strong performers in the defensive <b>secondary.</b> <b>Safety</b> Torrian Gray intercepted four passes during the regular season, returning one of the catches for a touchdown. He tied with cornerback William Yarborough for the most interceptions on the team during the regular season. Neither player was the team's leading tackler, however. That honor went to linebacker George DelRicco, who had 130 tackles during the regular season.|$|E

5|$|The {{defensive}} backfield, {{often called}} the secondary, consists of cornerbacks (CB) and safeties (S). Safeties are themselves divided into free safeties (FS) and strong safeties (SS). Cornerbacks line up outside the defensive formation, typically opposite of a receiver {{so as to be}} able to cover him, while safeties line up between the cornerbacks but farther back in the <b>secondary.</b> <b>Safeties</b> are the last line of defense, and are responsible for stopping deep passing plays as well as running plays.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to build an evaluation system for <b>secondary</b> task driving <b>safety</b> by using method of Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (F-ANP). Forty drivers completed driving on driving simulator while interacting with or without a secondary task. Measures of fixations, saccades, and vehicle running status were analyzed. According to five experts' opinions, a hierarchical model for <b>secondary</b> task driving <b>safety</b> evaluation was built. The hierarchical model was divided into three levels: goal, assessment dimension, and criteria. Seven indexes make up the level of criteria, and the assessment dimension includes two clusters: vehicle control risk and driver eye movement risk. By method of F-ANP, the priorities of the criteria and the subcriteria were determined. Furthermore, to rank the driving safety, an approach based on the principle of maximum membership degree was adopted. At last, a case study of <b>secondary</b> task driving <b>safety</b> evaluation by forty drivers using the proposed method was done. The results indicated that the application of the proposed method is practically feasible and adoptable for <b>secondary</b> task driving <b>safety</b> evaluation...|$|R

30|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} year of <b>secondary</b> school, <b>safety</b> at school and {{connectedness}} were significant predictors of mental wellbeing (Table  2). Somewhat similar to the primary school results, school connectedness was the most significant protective factor against depression (β = − 3.14), whereas feeling safe at school was the most significant protective factor against anxiety (β = − 4.01) and stress (β = − 2.97). School connectedness was protective for all emotional difficulties subscales. However, feeling safe at school was most protective against emotional symptoms (β = − 0.74) and conduct problems (β = − 0.61).|$|R

50|$|The first, {{mainly in}} the United States, refers to safety systems that help avoid accidents, such as good {{steering}} and brakes. In this context, passive safety refers to features that help reduce the effects of an accident, such as seat belts, airbags and strong body structures. This use is essentially interchangeable with the terms primary and <b>secondary</b> <b>safety</b> that tend {{to be used in}} the UK.|$|E
50|$|Under U.S. {{federal law}} (UL 325), garage door openers {{manufactured}} for the U.S. since 1993 must include a <b>secondary</b> <b>safety</b> reversing system, such as photoelectric eyes or sensors, mounted near the floor. Other examples of safety reversing systems, allowed within the guideline of UL 325, include electric safety edges, which reverse with approximately 15 pounds of downward pressure, and a garage door and opener system without photo eyes, tested together, which reverses upon approximately 15 pounds of pressure.|$|E

50|$|Besides regular primary level safety systems, {{in common}} with most nuclear power plants in the world, Tihange has <b>secondary</b> level <b>safety</b> systems that can {{autonomously}} keep the power plant safe during large external accidents such as the crash of an aircraft, external explosions or loss of the primary level. The primary level systems {{have two or three}} redundant trains of <b>safety.</b> The <b>secondary</b> level systems are 3x50% or 2x100%. and have their own heatsink separate from the primary heatsink. The primary heatsink is the Meuse river while the secondary heatsink is water from underground water tables.|$|R

50|$|In the {{automotive}} sector the term active safety (or primary safety) refers to safety {{systems that are}} active prior to an accident. This has traditionally referred to non-complex systems such as good visibility from the vehicle and low interior noise levels. Nowadays, however, this area contains highly advanced systems such as anti-lock braking system, electronic stability control and collision warning/avoidance through automatic braking. This compares with passive safety (or <b>secondary</b> <b>safety),</b> which are active during an accident. To this category belong seat belts, deformation zones and air-bags, etc.|$|E
50|$|It is {{recommended}} that any knot {{which is used to}} attach a rope to a safety harness is always finished with a 'stopper' knot. A stopper knot, while serving to keep the loose end tidy, will not only help to prevent failure of the primary knot, but also act as a <b>secondary</b> <b>safety</b> knot itself. It is sometimes said that if enough of a tail is left to tie a stopper knot, the stopper becomes unnecessary. The tail should be a minimum of 40 - 60 cm depending on the thickness of the rope.|$|E
5000|$|Roller coaster trains {{also have}} {{restraints}} {{that keep the}} passengers in their seats. There are two major types of restraints: lapbar and over-the-shoulder (Most modern OSTR restraints {{come into contact with}} riders at the lap; however, older so-called [...] "horsecollar" [...] ones actually restrain riders by the shoulders). Restraints always use two locking mechanisms, one on each side, for redundancy. If one fails, the restraint will remain locked. Most roller coasters also have seat belts that may act as <b>secondary</b> <b>safety</b> devices. On over-the-shoulder restraints, this seatbelt is mostly cosmetic as the restraint locks on its own.|$|E
25|$|The Colts' main {{strength}} was their defense. Pro Bowl defensive tackle Bubba Smith anchored the line. Behind him, the Colts had two outstanding linebackers: Pro Bowler Mike Curtis, who recorded 5 interceptions, and Ted Hendricks. In the <b>secondary,</b> Pro Bowl <b>safety</b> Jerry Logan recorded 6 interceptions for 92 return yards and 2 touchdowns, while safety Rick Volk had 4 interceptions for 61 return yards.|$|R
50|$|Leashes {{are still}} the source of some {{contention}} in surfing today as, although they are now accepted as mandatory equipment for shortboarders, many longboarders refuse to wear them, claiming it interferes with their ability to {{walk up and down}} the board. At crowded surf spots with large waves, it is argued that the freedom of not wearing a leash is <b>secondary</b> to the <b>safety</b> of others.|$|R
5000|$|Portland Mountain Rescue is {{a search}} and rescue {{organization}} based in Portland, Oregon, United States.

50|$|Reusable grenades were {{improved}} by Scott Frank {{to emulate the}} fragmentation of a real grenade in war games and scenarios. The grenade can be loaded with paint or BB’s. It uses a quick release of highly pressurized gas to break the shell and quickly disperse BB’s or paint in all directions. Frank’s grenade, although not the first, aimed to be as realistic and predictable as an actual grenade. He developed a more accurate timing mechanism and <b>secondary</b> <b>safety</b> mechanisms to prevent accidental discharge. Both marking rounds and reusable grenades gave airsoft the edge it needed to enter into military and law enforcement training grounds.|$|E
5000|$|The Kadett B {{inherited}} its suspension {{from the}} Kadett A. Two years after launch, however, in August 1967, the simple longitudinally mounted leaf springs with a centrally connected rigid axle which till then had suspended {{the rear wheels}} were replaced with a more sophisticated set-up incorporating coil springs, trailing arms and a Panhard rod. Road holding was usefully improved. [...] At the same time, reflecting growing preoccupation with <b>secondary</b> <b>safety</b> in the marketplace, the old steering wheel was replaced with a padded [...] "Safety" [...] steering wheel, now mounted on a telescopic steering column {{which was designed to}} collapse {{in the event of a}} serious collision.|$|E
5000|$|Marking the {{increasing}} concern with <b>secondary</b> <b>safety</b> {{at the time}} was the opening by the Minister of Technology Tony Benn, in April 1968, of MIRA's indoor rig for crash-testing cars in head-on impacts. [...] Such tests, at 30 mph, had recently become mandatory for cars sold in the US. [...] The MIRA crash rig featured the UK's largest industrial linear induction motor.

50|$|The Steelers defense ranked {{fourth in}} the NFL, giving up 284.0 total yards per game. The Pittsburgh defense was led by its linebacking corps: Joey Porter, James Farrior, Clark Haggans, and Larry Foote. Porter led all NFL linebackers with 10.5 quarterback sacks and also {{recorded}} two interceptions and a fumble recovery. Haggans tallied nine sacks and 40 tackles, while Farrior added a team-high 119 tackles to go with his two sacks and one fumble recovery. In the <b>secondary,</b> free <b>safety</b> Chris Hope led the team with three interceptions, while Pro Bowl safety Troy Polamalu, the team's top threat in the defensive backfield, notched 91 tackles, three sacks, two fumble recoveries, and two interceptions.|$|R
50|$|The Cowboys perennially potent offense {{fell into}} disarray during the 1984 season. The {{offensive}} line was ravaged by injury and retirement, and Cowboy quarterbacks were under duress all season. The line also struggled to open holes for the running game, despite another productive season from running back Tony Dorsett, who rushed for 1,189 yards. Turnovers were {{another source of}} frustration, as the offense turned it over 42 times. The defense once again featured a strong pass rush, led by perennial all-pro defensive tackle Randy White, {{as well as an}} opportunistic <b>secondary,</b> with <b>safety</b> Michael Downs leading the way with seven interceptions. However, stopping the run was a problem throughout the season, as the defense allowed 4.4 yards per carry.|$|R

50|$|The 1960s was {{a decade}} when forward looking {{manufacturers}} were highlighting <b>secondary</b> <b>safety</b> features. Those on the K70 included a fuel tank mounted directly {{ahead of the}} rear axle and boot/trunk, and within the wheelbase. As publicity for the Mercedes-Benz S Class would stress when that car was launched in 1972, this was the least vulnerable position {{in terms of the}} risk of the fuel tank being punctured {{in the event of a}} crash. The steering column was angled in order to reduce the risk of its being pushed too far back into the passenger cabin, and while seat belts were an optional extra, at least on the domestic market, mounting points for them were standard.|$|E
