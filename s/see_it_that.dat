[...] A resolution involves change but for the single individual this involves only change in oneself. It never means changing the whole world or even changing the other person.|$|E

NBA commissioner David Stern also believed Lin was not drafted due to discrimination. [...] "I don't know whether he was discriminated against because he was at Harvard. Or because he was Asian," [...] said Stern. Some fans and commentators wrote off his Warriors signing as a publicity stunt. Larry Riley, the team's general manager, denied catering to the Bay Area's large Asian population. He understood that some people would <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way. [...] "We evaluated him throughout summer league," [...] Riley said. [...] "All that had to happen was for him to confirm what we already believed." [...] While the team created a campaign around him, Riley said {{it would not have been}} advisable if Lin was not a basketball player first.|$|E
500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on November 29, 1910. One advertisement stated that an alternate title for the film was The Castaway Finds the Hidden Treasure, but this may be in error. The film had a wide national release, advertising theaters are known in Kansas, Texas, South Dakota, Vermont, and Missouri. The film was met with positive reviews by bothThe Moving Picture World and The New York Dramatic Mirror. The reviewer for the World highlighted that novelty of the subject, having the child being pawned only to be reclaimed by the father. Despite the novelty of the plot, the reviewer stated, [...] "While the play attracts because of this novelty, it still has dramatic interest, dramatic because it tells a life story in a simple way. Such stories are the most interesting since there are numerous persons who <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> can duplicate it either in their own experience or the experience {{of some of their}} friends or acquaintances." [...] The reviewer for the Mirror was critical of the film, stating the plot was improbable, but it was well-acted. The only fault identified by the reviewer was the improper depiction of the poor, for the mother could not keep her child, but kept her maid. The reviewer also noted that the maid also did not age after the apparent ten year time-skip.|$|E

2500|$|On June 8, 2008, {{days before}} the first few reviews for the film came online, Shyamalan told the New York Daily News: [...] "We're making an {{excellent}} B movie, that's our goal". Some critics enjoyed it because of this. Glenn Whipp said, [...] "Tamping down the self-seriousness in favor of some horrific silliness, M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening plays as a genuinely enjoyable B-movie for anyone inclined (or able) to <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way".|$|E

Most of the people at the demonstration will in fact be unaware of exactly who said what and whether any particular speaker omitted this or that point.

2500|$|In January 1983 {{the police}} evicted Allotria. A force of about 1500 policemen had been mobilized, and the squatters {{realized}} that they stood no chance against such numbers. When the police entered the house, the squatters had already escaped through a tunnel dug under the street. The tunnel was seen {{by the media and}} the public as a creative stroke of genius. The police were ridiculed in the papers, and the general public saw it as victory for the squatters. The squatters didn't <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way. To them, the loss of their homes was at best bittersweet. Over {{the next couple of days}} the massive police force evicted the rest of the squats in Nørrebro. [...] Bulldozers then moved in and demolished the houses.|$|E
2500|$|R. G. Frey, {{professor}} of philosophy at Bowling Green State University, is a preference utilitarian, as is Singer, but reaches a very different conclusion, arguing in Interests and Rights (1980) that animals have no interests for the utilitarian to take into account. Frey argues that interests are dependent on desire, and that no desire can exist without a corresponding belief. Animals have no beliefs, because a belief state requires the ability to hold a second-order belief—a belief about the belief—which he argues requires language: [...] "If someone were to say, e.g. 'The cat believes that the door is locked,' then that person is holding, as I <b>see</b> <b>it,</b> <b>that</b> the cat holds the declarative sentence 'The door is locked' to be true; and I can see no reason whatever for crediting the cat or any other creature which lacks language, including human infants, with entertaining declarative sentences." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Avi Primor, {{president}} of the Israel Council on Foreign Relations, Grass was the only important German cultural figure who had refused {{to meet with him}} when he served as Israeli ambassador to Germany. Primor noted: [...] "One explanation for [...] strange behavior might be found in the fact that Grass (who despite his poem is probably not the bitter enemy of Israel that one would imagine) had certain personal difficulties with Israel." [...] Primor said that during Grass's earlier visit to Israel, he [...] "was confronted with the anger of an Israeli public that booed him in successive public appearances. To be sure, the Israeli protestors were not targeting Grass personally and their anger had nothing at all to do with his literature. It was the German effort to establish cultural relations with Israel to which they objected. Grass, however, did not <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way and may well have felt personally slighted." ...|$|E

2500|$|De La Hoya {{defended his}} unified title against Yori Boy Campas (80–5) with a routine seventh round {{stoppage}} then faced Shane Mosley (38–2) in a rematch. The fight, billed as [...] "Retribution" [...] and staged at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, {{was more of}} a boxing match than their first encounter, and while some rounds were close, De La Hoya's game plan utilizing his jab seemed to be paying off, leaving Mosley visually frustrated. It was De La Hoya who seemed to be landing the cleaner, more effective punches, and obliterated Mosley in Compubox, landing over 100 more. But judges apparently didn't <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way awarding Mosley with the controversial unanimous decision. Mosley was later connected to the BALCO Labs steroid scandal. Jeff Novitzky, a lead investigator on the BALCO case, reported that documents seized from the lab show that Mosley received [...] "the clear" [...] and [...] "the cream," [...] both designer steroids. Mosley reportedly began his doping regimen prior to his rematch with Oscar De La Hoya. Mosley would later admit to using performance-enhancing drugs from BALCO for this bout, saying he thought they were legal supplements.|$|E
2500|$|Of the {{decision}} to have Lexa betray Clarke, a significant moment for the series that allowed the writers to strain the characters' relationship, Rothenberg said Lexa {{was under the impression}} Clarke would likely die in the battle and Mount Weather would possibly remain to keep her people united. [...] "She was probably—master strategist that she is—thinking several moves ahead. Thinking she could keep her alliance together, the 12 clans, because they would still have this evil empire out there to unite them," [...] he stated. Lexa was not expecting Clarke to win, and to subsequently become a legend. [...] "Everywhere she goes it's like, 'I heard it was 5,000 people! No, I heard it was 10,000 people!' Everywhere she goes, [...] a legend now," [...] said Rothenberg. [...] "Certainly it means that her alliance now no longer has a real reason to be held together. [...] I'm really excited to play out the ramifications of all of that." [...] Rothenberg said Clarke would eventually {{come to terms with the}} likelihood that, if she had been in a similar position as Lexa, she would have done the same thing: Protect her own people at all costs. He said she did as much in the season 2 finale. [...] "That was kind of the theme of the entire season, which was how far can you go and still be the good guy in order to save your people. Lexa had that choice in [...] 15. Obviously, it landed very emotionally for both of them, but especially on Clarke," [...] he stated. [...] "In [...] 16, Clarke had a similar choice and I hope that over the course of the first part of , Clarke will eventually come to <b>see</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> way. If she can't, then they'll never figure out a way to make peace with each other".|$|E
