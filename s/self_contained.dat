25|$|Thomas A. Walker was the {{contractor}} entrusted {{by the chief}} GWR engineer Sir John Hawkshaw with rescuing and completing the tunnel after the 1879 flooding. Holding the Great Spring in check required the installation of greatly increased pumping facilities, and a diver had to be sent down a shaft and 300m along the tunnel heading to close a watertight door in the workings and seal off the waters. This troublesome task was finally achieved in November 1880 by lead diver Alexander Lambert using Henry Fleuss' new <b>self</b> <b>contained</b> breathing apparatus, but work {{in the area of}} the Great Spring was unable to continue until January 1881 when the Great Spring was temporarily sealed off.|$|E

There are two kinds of SCBA: open circuit and closed circuit. Most modern SCBAs are open-circuit.|$|E

2500|$|In 1939, Christian Lambertsen {{developed}} an oxygen rebreather {{he called the}} Lambertsen Amphibious Respirator Unit (LARU) and patented it in 1940. He later renamed it the <b>Self</b> <b>Contained</b> Underwater Breathing Apparatus, which, contracted to SCUBA, eventually became the generic term for both open circuit and rebreather autonomous underwater breathing equipment. Lambertson demonstrated the apparatus to the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) [...] who hired him to lead the program {{to build up the}} dive element of their maritime unit. After World War II, military frogmen continued to use rebreathers since they do not make bubbles which would give away the presence of the divers.|$|E
2500|$|The first commercially {{practical}} scuba rebreather {{was designed}} and built by the diving engineer Henry Fleuss in 1878, while working for Siebe Gorman in London. His <b>self</b> <b>contained</b> breathing apparatus consisted of a rubber mask connected to a breathing bag, with (estimated) 50-60% O2 supplied from a copper tank and CO2 scrubbed by rope yarn soaked in a solution of caustic potash; the system giving a duration of about three hours. This apparatus was first used under operational conditions in 1880 by the lead diver on the Severn Tunnel construction project, {{who was able to}} travel [...] in the darkness to close several submerged sluice doors in the tunnel; this had defeated the best efforts of hard hat divers due to the danger of their air supply hoses becoming fouled on submerged debris, and the strong water currents in the workings.|$|E
2500|$|... (1979) Efficiency of <b>self</b> <b>contained</b> {{breathing}} apparatus (SCBA) MSA {{has been studied}} when they were used by firefighters. This SCBA had had air supply into the mask with [...] "on demand" [...] mode (with negative pressure under the mask during inhalation). Evaluation {{of the effectiveness of}} the respirator was conducted by determining the content of carboxyhemoglobin in the blood immediately after the cessation of fire extinguishing. Carboxyhemoglobin formed due to inhalation of carbon monoxide. The biomonitoring results shown: (1) the intermittently usage of these respirators makes it totally ineffective; (2) even in continuous usage of such {{breathing apparatus}} does not provide effective protection. The results of this study (and other similar studies) led to restrict the use of respirators with fresh air supply [...] "on demand"; and to prohibit their use in fighting fires. US and EU legislation obliges to use only self-contained breathing apparatus with [...] "pressure-demand" [...] mode of air supply (it provide positive pressure under the mask during inhalation) in extinguishing fires.|$|E

5000|$|Self-esteem {{describes}} {{how a person}} evaluates their self positively or negatively. Four {{factors that contribute to}} self-esteem are the reactions we get from other people, how we compare people to ourselves, social roles, and our identification. Our social roles can sometimes be conceived as higher intelligence or ability, such as an Olympic athlete or biotechnologist. Other social roles might be stigmatized as being negative, such as a criminal or homeless person. People with high self-esteem view their <b>selves</b> as <b>containing</b> positive traits. They are more willing to take more risks and aim for success. People with high self-esteem tend to be confident, gain self-acceptance, do not worry as much about what others think about them, and think more optimistically.
