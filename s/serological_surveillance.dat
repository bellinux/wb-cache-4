50|$|Batai virus (BATV) is an enveloped, single-stranded, {{negative}} sense RNA genome. It is {{a member}} of the genus Orthobunyavirus and belongs to the family Bunyaviridae; it was first isolated from Culex mosquitoes in Malaysia in 1955. Evidence from <b>serological</b> <b>surveillance</b> and virus isolation shows that this virus is widely distributed around the world. Because it’s likeness to other orthobunyaviruses it contributes to both human and animal disease. In humans it has been noted in causing severe fever, and in bovines has been associated with premature birth, birth defects, and increased abortion rates. It is transmitted through mosquito bites, ticks, and biting midges, and occurs from cold to tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Europe.|$|E
40|$|Trichinellosis is a {{zoonotic}} disease that {{is caused by}} the nematode Trichinella spp. Both European Union regulations and guidelines from the World Organization for Animal Health foresee the possibility of conducting <b>serological</b> <b>surveillance</b> for Trichinella spp. A newly developed commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was evaluated against 2 existing diagnostic techniques: an in-house ELISA and an in-house Western blot. A total of 875 Trichinella larva-negative samples of pigs and 93 Trichinella larva-positive samples of both naturally and experimentally infected pigs were included in the study. Bayesian modeling techniques were used to correct for the absence of a perfect reference test. The sensitivity and specificity of the commercial ELISA was 97. 1 - 97. 8 % and 99. 5 - 99. 8 %, respectively. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated high stability in the models. In a <b>serological</b> <b>surveillance</b> system, ELISA-positive samples should be tested by a confirmatory test. The Western blot is a suitable test for this purpose. With the use {{of the results of the}} models, the sensitivity and specificity of a test protocol in both ELISA and Western blot were 95. 9 % and 99. 9 %, respectively.

40|$|Abstract: Highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} (HPAI) H 5 N 1 has posed a significant threat to both humans and birds, {{and it has}} spanned large geographic areas and various ecological systems throughout Asia, Europe and Africa, but especially in mainland China. Great efforts in control and prevention of the disease, including universal vaccination campaigns in poultry and active <b>serological</b> and virological <b>surveillance,</b> have been undertaken in mainland China {{since the beginning of}} 2006. In this study, we aim to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of HPAI H 5 N 1, and identify influencing factors favoring the occurrence of HPAI H 5 N 1 outbreaks in poultry in mainland China. Our study shows that HPAI H 5 N 1 outbreaks took place sporadically after vaccination campaigns in poultry, and mostly occurred in the cold season. The positive tests in routine virological surveillance of HPAI H 5 N 1 virus in chicken, duck, goose as well as environmental samples were mapped to display the potential risk distribution of the virus.

We herein describe an advanced microsphere-based immunoassay that permits the simul-taneous detection of antibodies to PCV 2 and PRRSV, thereby reducing the time and effort involved in testing. Recombinant PRRSV nucleoprotein antigen and the PCV 2 capsid antigen were coupled to fluorophore-dyed beads with distinct spectral addresses. Weekly serum samples from 72 pigs that were experimentally exposed to either PCV 2, PRRSV, or both PCV 2 and PRRSV were used to validate the microbead assay (MBA) in comparison with the “gold standard ” enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The kinetics of the PCV 2 - and PRRSV-specific antibody responses measured by the microbead assay were comparable to those of the standard assays; Spearman’s rank correlations were 0. 72 (P < 0. 001) for PRRSV and 0. 80 (P < 0. 001) for PCV 2. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were determined using field sera whose positive or negative status was determined by the standard tests.

40|$|Background: In {{influenza}} epidemiology, {{analysis of}} paired sera collected from people {{before and after}} influenza seasons {{has been used for}} decades to study the cumulative incidence of influenza virus infections in populations. However, interpretation becomes challenging when sera are collected after the start or before the end of an epidemic, and do not neatly bracket the epidemic. Methods: Serum samples were collected longitudinally in a community-based study. Most participants provided their first serum after the start of circulation of influenza A(H 1 N 1) pdm 09 virus in 2009. We developed a Bayesian hierarchical model to correct for nonbracketing sera and estimate the cumulative incidence of infection from the <b>serological</b> data and <b>surveillance</b> data in Hong Kong. Results: We analyzed 4, 843 sera from 2, 097 unvaccinated participants in the study, collected from April 2009 to December 2010. After accounting for nonbracketing, we estimated that the cumulative incidence of H 1 N 1 pdm 09 virus infection was 45 % (95 % credible interval [CI] = 40 %, 49 %), 17 % (95 % CI = 13 %, 20 %), and 11 % (95 % CI = 6 %, 18 %) for children ages 0 – 18 years, adults 19 – 50 years, and older adults > 50 years, respectively. Including all available data substantially increased precision compared with a simpler analysis based only on sera collected at 6 -month intervals in a subset of participants. Conclusions: We developed a framework for the analysis of antibody titers that accounted for the timing of sera collection with respect to influenza activity and permitted robust estimation of the cumulative incidence of infection during an epidemic. postprin...|$|R

Methods: Pig sera from 9833 animals from 1974 farms in 9 counties were examined using agar gel precipitation (AGP) to screen for the presence of antibody against influenza A virus. AGP-positive sera were subjected to hemagglutination-inhibition test against H 1, H 3, H 5 and H 7 AIV subtypes and H 1 and H 3 SIV subtypes. Nasal swabs from 881 pigs were also examined for the presence of SIV by virus isolation in specific pathogen-free embryonated chicken eggs. Virus isolates were identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction followed by DNA sequencing of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes. Results: The AGP test on sera revealed the presence of antibodies against influenza A virus in 62. 6 % of farms and in 37. 7 % of pig sera. SIV antibodies to subtype H 1 and H 3 were found in 10. 8 % and 65. 8 % of sera, respectively. There were two peaks of the serological prevalence of SIV in pigs: one between January and February, and the other in October.

Findings: Serum and tissue samples from 295 resident and migratory wild birds, hunter-harvested during the 2009 - 2010 and 2010 - 2011 hunting seasons at the epicenter of the outbreak in northern Greece, were tested for the presence of WNV-specific antibodies by immunofluorescence assay and virus neutralization test. WNV neutralizing antibodies were detected in 53 avian samples. Fourteen positive sera were obtained from birds hunter-harvested up to 8 months prior to the human outbreak. Specific genetic determinants of virulence (His 249 Pro NS 3 mutation, E-glycosylation motif) were recognized in a WNV lineage 2 strain isolated from a hunter-harvested Eurasian magpie and a nucleotide mismatch was revealed between this strain and a mosquito WNV strain isolated one month earlier in the same area.

40|$|Brucellosis is a {{bacterial}} zoonotic disease {{which has been}} associated with laboratory-acquired infections. No recent reviews have addressed the characteristics of laboratory-acquired brucellosis (LAB). English-language literature was reviewed to identify re-ports of laboratory exposures to Brucella spp. and LAB cases between 1982 and 2007. Evaluation of 28 case reports identified 167 potentially exposed laboratory workers, of whom 71 had LAB. Nine reports were identified that summarized an additional 186 cases of LAB. Only 18 (11 %) exposures were due to laboratory accidents, 147 (88 %) exposures were due to aerosolization of or-ganisms during routine identification activities, and the circumstances of 2 (1 %) exposures were unknown. Brucella melitensis was the causative agent in 80 % (135 / 167) of the exposures. Workers with high-risk exposures were 9. 3 times more likely to de-velop LAB than workers with low-risk exposures (95 % confidence interval [CI], 3. 0 to 38. 6; P< 0. 0001); they were also 0. 009 times likelier to develop LAB if they took antimicrobial PEP than if they did not (95 % CI, 0 to 0. 042; P< 0. 0001).

Free HIV care including ART has been available since 2005. Event history {{analysis was used to}} compare mortality rates among HIV-negative and HIV-positive adults in the 5 -year period before and after the introduction of ART. Crude and adjusted hazard ratios were calculated using exponential regression models. Interaction between time period and HIV status was assessed to investigate whether there was a non-linear relationship between these two variables. results Male and female mortality patterns varied over the pre- and post-ART period. In women, the crude death rate fell for both HIV negatives and HIV positives hazard rate ratio (HRR = 0. 71; 95 %CI 0. 51 – 0. 99 and HRR = 0. 68; 95 %CI: 0. 46 – 0. 99, respectively). For men, the mortality among the HIV negatives increased (HRR = 1. 47; 95 %CI: 1. 06 – 2. 03) while the decline in mortality among the HIV positives (HRR = 0. 77; 95 %CI 0. 52 – 1. 13) was not statistically significant. The largest decrease in HIV-positive mortality over the two periods was among the 30 - to 44 -year-old age group for women and among the 45 - to 59 -year-old age group for men. conclusion There has been a modest effect on mortality in the study population following the introduction of free ART 5 years ago.

The purpose of the survey was {{to investigate the}} infection status in free ranging wild birds in Banglane district, Nakhon Pathom province, central Thailand. Samples from wild birds were collected every two months. Choanal and cloacal swabs, serum and tissue samples were collected from 421 birds comprising 44 species. Sero-prevalence of the virus tested by H 5 N 1 serum neutralization test (using a H 5 N 1 virus clade 1; A/chicken/Thailand/vsmu- 3 -BKK/ 2004) was 2. 1 % (8 out of 385 samples; 95 % CI 0. 7, 3. 5). Species that were antibody positive included rock pigeons (Columba livia), Asian pied starling (Gracupica contra), spotted dove (Streptopelia chinensis), oriental magpie robin (Copsychus saularis), blue-tailed bee-eater (Merops philippinus), myna (Acridotheres spp.), and pond heron (Ardeola spp.). Prevalence by H 5 N 1 virus isolation was 0. 5 % (2 out of 421 samples; 95 % CI 0. 0, 1. 1); the two H 5 N 1 virus-positive samples were from Asian pied starling (Gracupica contra) and white vented myna (Acridotheres grandis). Positive virological samples were collected in June 2007 while all positive serology samples were collected between May and August except for one sample collected in December 2007. No positive samples were collected in 2008. Molecular studies revealed that the wild bird H 5 N 1 viruses were closely related to poultry viruses isolated in other parts of Thailand. However, there was no poultry H 5 N 1 prevalence study performed in the study site during the time of this wild bird survey. Interpretation of source of virus isolates would include spill-over of H 5 N 1 viruses from contaminated sources due to movement of domestic poultry and/or fomites from other areas; or infection of wild birds within the outbreak locations and then translocation by wild bird movement and interaction with wild birds inhabiting distant locations. © 2010 Elsevier B.

O ML Flow foi positivo em 20, 5 % dos contatos de hanseníase, sendo maior nos contatos do sexo masculino (22, 4 %), nos maiores de 15 anos (21, 7 %), nos contatos de doentes multibacilares (23, 9 %). A chance de um contato ser soropositivo foi maior se convivia com caso multibacilar (OR= 1, 75), idade {{superior}} a 15 anos (OR= 1, 38) e sexo masculino (OR= 1, 25). O acompanhamento desses contatos permitirá, no futuro, avaliar o risco que a soropositividade representa no desenvolvimento de hanseníase. Leprosy is {{a public}} health problem in Brazil. Epidemiological control actions {{are based on the}} diagnosis and treatment of leprosy patients and household contact <b>surveillance.</b> <b>Serological</b> tests for leprosy could identify from among the contacts those at greater risk of developing leprosy in the future. ML Flow was administered to 2, 840 household contacts of new leprosy cases diagnosed from October 2002 to March 2004, in State of Minas Gerais. ML Flow was positive in 20. 5 % of leprosy contacts, with high seropositivity among males (22. 4 %), individuals aged over 15 years-old (21. 7 %) and individuals in contact with multibacillary cases (23. 9 %). The chances of a household contact presenting a seropositive test was related to household contact with a multibacillary index case (OR= 1. 75), age over 15 years-old (OR= 1. 38) and male gender (OR= 1. 25). Follow-up of these contacts is necessary to evaluate the real role of seropositivity in the development of leprosy disease...|$|R
40|$|The {{placement}} of retarded {{children who have}} been institutionalized and are asymptomatic hepatitis-B surface antigen carriers into public school classes for the retarded has caused controversy and presented the New York City Health Department with an unusual medical-ethical dilemma. In this situation, the cost of interfering with deinstitutionalization, an important social advance, must be balanced against the benefit of controlling the unquantified but real risk of transmitting a potentially serious disease. The Health Department guidelines for managing this problem recommended <b>serological</b> <b>surveillance,</b> promotion of classroom hygiene where possible, and teaching of carriers in classes separate from their susceptible peers. A federal court disallowed the cohorting provisions of these guidelines. Changing policies and practices towards the mentally retarded, such as deinstitutionalization, raise important public health issues which will have to be faced by the involved communities...|$|E

Fourteen days after symptom onset, elevated levels of antibodies to A(H 7 N 9) were found in 65. 8 % of patients (25 / 38) who survived but in only 28. 6 % of those (2 / 7) who died, suggesting that the presence of antibodies may improve clinical outcome in infected patients...|$|E
40|$|A <b>serological</b> <b>surveillance</b> {{study was}} {{conducted}} between March and June 2006 in the southern provinces of Cambodia to determine the prevalence and distribution of foot-and-mouth disease. Cattle and buffalo originating from eight provinces and 69 villages were sampled. The results revealed that the village level prevalence of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in the southern provinces of Cambodia was 87 % with an overall individual animal prevalence of 30 %. Three serotypes: O, A and Asia 1 were detected in this region with a prevalence of 28. 5, 9. 5 and 9. 3 %, respectively. However, as the antibody level to FMDV serotypes A and Asia 1 were generally low, {{it is likely that}} serotype O is responsible for most of the recent outbreaks of FMD in Cambodia. Seropositive animals were older than seronegative animals, especially with serotype O...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background National HIV <b>serological</b> and {{behavioural}} <b>surveillance</b> of Bangladesh repeatedly {{demonstrated a}} very high proportion of rickshaw pullers in Dhaka city, having sex with female sex workers (FSWs) and using illicit substances. However, no study has been conducted to identify the correlates {{of having sex with}} FSWs among this population. This study aimed to describe behavioural profile of rickshaw pullers in Dhaka city using probability samples and to identify the correlates for having sex with FSWs in order to focus HIV prevention intervention. Methods Six hundred rickshaw pullers were randomly selected from rickshaw garages in the Kamrangirchar area, the single largest slum cluster of Dhaka, Bangladesh, during March–April 2008 using the Proportion Probability to Size method. Participants were interviewed, with a response rate of 99. 2 % (n = 595), using a structured questionnaire and asked about illicit substance use, sexual behaviour and risk perception for HIV and sexually transmitted diseases. Independent predictors of having sex with FSWs were analysed by multivariate analysis. A qualitative study was subsequently conducted with 30 rickshaw pullers to supplement the findings of the initial survey. Results The proportion of survey respondents who had sex with FSWs and those who used illicit substances in the previous 12 months period were 7. 9 % and 24. 9 %, respectively, much lower than the results achieved in the 2003 – 04 behavioural surveillance (72. 8 % and 89. 9 %, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed the characteristics of younger age, being never married, living alone with family remaining in other districts and using illicit substances in the previous 12 months were significantly associated with having sex with FSWs. Conclusion HIV-related risk behaviour of our study population of the rickshaw pullers was lower than what has been suggested by the results of behavioural surveillance. While this discrepancy should be addressed in further studies, our study emphasizes the importance of focused HIV prevention programs for rickshaw pullers as high-risk behaviour is displayed at an unacceptable level and concentrated in identifiable sub-populations. </p...|$|R
40|$|Highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} (HPAI) H 5 N 1 has posed a significant threat to both humans and birds, {{and it has}} spanned large geographic areas and various ecological systems throughout Asia, Europe and Africa, but especially in mainland China. Great efforts in control and prevention of the disease, including universal vaccination campaigns in poultry and active <b>serological</b> and virological <b>surveillance,</b> have been undertaken in mainland China {{since the beginning of}} 2006. In this study, we aim to characterize the spatial and temporal patterns of HPAI H 5 N 1, and identify influencing factors favoring the occurrence of HPAI H 5 N 1 outbreaks in poultry in mainland China. Our study shows that HPAI H 5 N 1 outbreaks took place sporadically after vaccination campaigns in poultry, and mostly occurred in the cold season. The positive tests in routine virological surveillance of HPAI H 5 N 1 virus in chicken, duck, goose as well as environmental samples were mapped to display the potential risk distribution of the virus. Southern China had a higher positive rate than northern China, and positive samples were mostly detected from chickens in the north, while the majority were from duck in the south, and a negative correlation with monthly vaccination rates in domestic poultry was found (R = − 0. 19, p value = 0. 005). Multivariate panel logistic regression identified vaccination rate, interaction between distance to the nearest city and national highway, interaction between distance to the nearest lake and wetland, and density of human population, as well as the autoregressive term in space and time as independent risk factors in the occurrence of HPAI H 5 N 1 outbreaks, based on which a predicted risk map of the disease was derived. Our findings could provide new understanding of the distribution and transmission of HPAI H 5 N 1 in mainland China and could be used to inform targeted surveillance and control efforts in both human and poultry populations {{to reduce the risk of}} future infections...|$|R
40|$|The {{incidence}} of dengue (DEN) virus infection in Vietnam {{has increased dramatically}} in the past 30 years. From 1960 up to now, the number of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases has been continuing to increase and recorded as the greatest one in Southeast Asia and the Western Pacific Regions. DHF was endemic in South Vietnam and 30 - 380 cases/ 100, 000 population were reported annually. Major epidemics have occurred in a 3 - 4 years frequency, as in 1975, 1978 - 1979, 1983 and 1987. The 1987 outbreak was the largest one with 83, 905 cases and 904 deaths. DHF epidemics usually took place from June to November every year. The peak transmission was recorded in July-August and September, coinciding with the rainy season and the breeding period of Aedes aegypti. The majority of confirmed cases was children of 5 - 6 year-old-group, {{in which there was}} no sex difference. In the virological surveillance in Ho Chi Minh City and in some surrounding provinces, several DEN virus strains were isolated from patients' blood {{as well as from the}} mosquitoes. In the 1987 DHF outbreak, DEN- 2 was the dominant sero-type (90. 5 %). But from 1990 the epidemic sero-type has changed, DEN- 1 was introduced and was continuing to grow-up (58 %). Then in 1992 outbreak, the DEN- 2 was reintroduced, from 26. 3 % in 1991 has increased to 41. 4 %. Serological investigation of healthy persons in 12 / 17 southern provinces had demonstrated that there were relatively wide circulations of DEN, Japanese encephalitis (JE) and chikungunya (Chik) viruses and the endemic strains of DEN were found different in some studied areas. There had been augmentation of primary infection rate and decrease of the susceptibility rate in children prior to the DHF epidemic. Seven JE virus strains were isolated from dengue fever (DF) patients' blood. This fact has introduced as a new concept in the isolation of JE virus. In the final pant of the report, the authors stressed on the "Active surveillance" as a new strategy for controlling the DHF epidemic in South Vietnam. The goal of this active surveillance is to have early warning and predictive capability for epidemic dengue, based on <b>serological</b> and clinical <b>surveillance.</b> Because dengue cases were detected in January-February of every year, so the base line is: when first cases of DF/DHF were detected, it needs to be promptly implemented the larval control and insecticide must be sprayed around the patient's houses. But now almost Provincial Centers of Hygiene and Epidemiology often waited and when big DHF epidemic had already occurred, they started to implement its control measures, so it is too late to control the DHF outbreak...|$|R
