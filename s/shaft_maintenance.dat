5000|$|An early {{investigation}} revealed explosives {{were responsible}} for the burst. The explosives were used for illegal mining which had been underway in the colliery. According to deputy director of the State Administration of Coal Mine Safety Wang Shuhe, [...] "local authorities did not fully perform their duties, and occasionally even abetted or sheltered illegal activities". He visited the scene as part of the investigation. Work at all of Puding's collieries was suspended. Guizhou surveyed its coal mines for safety reasons on 15 May 2010. Guizhou's vice-governor Sun Guoqiang said authorities should have checked the mine and asked officials after the burst: [...] "Did anyone of you visit the mine after approving the <b>shaft</b> <b>maintenance</b> project"? ...|$|E
50|$|For the 180 {{years of}} the {{aqueduct}}'s use, from AD 80 to 260, the aqueduct required constant maintenance, improvement, cleaning, and freeing from limestone accretions. Maintenance was facilitated by regular <b>maintenance</b> <b>shafts,</b> through which a worker could descend into the aqueduct. Additional <b>maintenance</b> <b>shafts</b> were built at the sites of repairs and at the boundaries between building segments. There were also open pools at points where various springs ran together so that maintenance personnel could {{keep an eye on}} problem areas.|$|R

50|$|Bazita Peak TV Tower is a 100 m {{broadcasting}} {{tower in}} Zalaegerszeg, Hungary. The TV tower has a 13 m antenna atop the main structure and an observation level 60 m up the structure. The Alps can be clearly {{seen from the}} observation deck. Built in 1975, an elevator transports visitors to the café on the observation level and a staircase outside of the main <b>shaft</b> allows <b>maintenance</b> access.|$|R

50|$|The {{technology}} {{behind the}} building was a central ferroconcrete core, around which each floor was built. Because the floors were built using a mould, {{all of them were}} of exactly the same size and form. The core itself housed elevator shafts, staircases, and emergency and <b>maintenance</b> <b>shafts.</b>|$|R
50|$|Quark corners Ziyal, {{asking her}} to help him free Jake, Kira, Rom and Leeta. The two free the group. Kira organizes the {{sabotage}} of the station's weapons, and she and Rom set off for the station's core, pursued by Jem'Hadar forces. They are cornered in a cargo bay, but are rescued by Odo and Bajoran security. Odo's men cover them as they enter a <b>maintenance</b> <b>shaft</b> to sabotage the weapons.|$|R

In the meantime, Peter spots the bounty hunters and escapes down a <b>maintenance</b> <b>shaft.</b> He makes it to a vent grating outside the tavern just as a barroom brawl ensues among belligerent spacers. Unfortunately, Hawk is unable to hear Peter's cries for help over the ruckus and the bounty hunters capture him. Thinking Zeriatin has taken Peter, Hawk confronts him, but just then, Zariatin is alerted that the bounty hunters are making an {{unauthorized}} departure which Hawk believes can only mean {{that they have the}} boy.|$|R
50|$|As Captain Archer {{prepares to}} lead a survey team to an {{uninhabited}} planet, Enterprise is suddenly hailed by a trio of aliens, who warn him that a deadly neutronic wavefront, many light years across, is quickly approaching at a speed close to warp 7. Since his warp 5 ship cannot outrun the storm, Archer soon concludes that everyone must take shelter {{in order to survive}} the storm's radiation. Commander Tucker suggests that the one heavily shielded place on board that might suffice for the eight-day ordeal is the catwalk, a <b>maintenance</b> <b>shaft</b> that runs the length of each nacelle. Only one problemthe temperature there can reach 300 C degrees when the warp coils are online, so he will have to keep the main reactor offline.|$|R
30|$|A {{peculiar}} effect {{worth mentioning}} {{is the fact}} that SDDV introduces two dips in the DENM PSR curves. Such a behavior could not be observed in any of our simulations. The cause of this effect is the location of the corresponding nodes: they are positioned inside concrete <b>maintenance</b> <b>shafts</b> that interconnect the different floors of the building. Hence, the signals sent to these nodes are attenuated more fiercely. In the baseline solution, no problems occur due to the high level of rebroadcasting redundancy of the simple flooding technique. However, the reduced redundancy level of SDDV fails to entirely overcome this problem. This means that in real-life situations where some vehicles are enclosed by obstacles (e.g., trucks), it might be required to tweak the SDDV parameters to achieve reliable dissemination to these nodes without sacrificing general VANET performance. This can be researched in future work.|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of this policy will ensure that Council’s underground services (i. e. water, sewer and stormwater assets) are protected, from damage or loss of access that could be caused {{as a result of}} construction works. This policy is aimed at avoiding:- Structural damage to the water and sewerage pipes, {{as a result of the}} load from the structure being transferred to the underground service. This may cause the pipes to subside or fracture. Subsidence with consequent damage to the structure. Subsidence can occur when a pipeline breaks and the resultant flow of water reduces the bearing capacity of the surrounding soils. Barriers to access to manhole, <b>maintenance</b> <b>shafts</b> and inspection shafts, and the underground service. Future costs that could be incurred by having to remove and then replace structures that have been allowed to be built over or too close to underground services.

40|$|Abstract】Objective: Metaphyseal-diaphyseal {{fractures}} of {{the distal}} radius {{are a major}} treatment dilemma and orthopaedic surgeons have to pay due consideration to restoration of anatomy of distal radius together with ro- tation of the radial <b>shaft</b> and <b>maintenance</b> of radial bow and interosseous space. We performed this study to evaluate the clinic-radiological outcome of metaphyseal-diaphyseal fractures of the distal radius treated with long volar locking plates. Methods: This prospective study involved 27 pa- tients (22 males and 5 females) with metaphyseal-diaphy- seal fracture of the distal radius. Their mean age was (30. 12 ± 11. 48) years (range 19 - 52 years) and the follow-up was 26. 8 months (range 22 - 34 months). All patients underwent open reduction and internal fixation with a long volar locking plate. According to AO/OTA classification, there were 7 type A 3, 13 type C 2 and 7 type C 3 fractures. Subjective assessment was done based on the disabilities of the arm, shoulder and hand (DASH) questionnaire. Functional evaluation was done by measuring grip strength and range of motion around the wrist and the radiological determinants included radial angle, radial length, volar angle and ulnar variance. The final as- sessment was done according to Gartland and Werley scor- ing system. Results: Postoperative radiological parameters were well maintained throughout the trial, and there was signifi- cant improvement in the functional parameters from 6 weeks to final follow-up. The average DASH scores improved from 37. 5 at 6 weeks to 4. 2 at final follow-up. Final assessment using Gartland and Werley scoring system revealed 66. 67...|$|R
50|$|In {{the tunnel}} the water {{breaches}} the ceiling. The {{driver of the}} train (Konstantin Ovseannicov) that by coincidence contains Garin, Konstantinov and Galina activates the emergency brake. The train derails and crashes {{into the water and}} rubble. Some of the passengers are killed. Konstantinov, instead of going along the rails, climbs onto the roof of the car. Crawling along, he sees Garin, who is trying to find Ksjushu in a pile of bodies, and helps Garin. Garin is going to follow the others but Konstantinov stops him, pointing out that the contact rail is still electrified. The water rises, a short circuit occurs, and all who did not escape the flooded area of the tunnel die from shock. Garin, Konstantinov and Galina, courier Michael (Stanislav Duzhkinov) and a couple, Denis (Alex Bardukov) and Alisa (Katherine Spitz), finally can seek to escape. All except Michael hurriedly make their way into a passage leading to a <b>maintenance</b> <b>shaft.</b> Michael, being very frightened, refuses to enter the passage and dies when the car rolls over.|$|R
50|$|From {{the passage}} the protagonists {{fall into a}} small bunker, built during the {{construction}} of underground. Above it, the vertical <b>maintenance</b> <b>shaft</b> ends in a sewer grate. However, they cannot reach the grate, which is too high, nor can they use their mobile phones underground. The water level in the tunnel and in the well begins to rise rapidly. Tension between Konstantinov and Garin rises, as the latter cannot understand why Konstantinov feels an interest in his daughter. When the water level raises them {{to the level of}} the grate, Garin and Konstantinov manage to phone Irina but only have time to tell her that they are in the bunker. They try to attract attention through the bars, but to no avail. Irina is hysterically trying to inform the rescue team that people are in the bunker. But at this time the pressure of the water rips off the train head and the water level in the shaft falls sharply, pulling the characters back into the tunnel. The rescuers descend into the bunker, but seeing the wet walls, assume that all who were there most likely drowned.|$|R
40|$|With the {{increasing}} use of health usage monitoring systems on helicopters, a lot of research has been undertaken for diagnosis of transmission components. However, most of these works are performed in laboratory environments and there are hardly any published works on in-service application. In this study, we present an experience in diagnosis of a helicopter gearbox bearing using actual service data gathered from AH 64 D helicopters belonging to the Republic of Singapore Air Force. A number of helicopters have been found with grease leak and radial play in the tail rotor gearbox output <b>shaft</b> during field <b>maintenance.</b> Subsequent tear-down inspections of the tail rotor gearboxes revealed that they had similar defects of bearing race spalling and widespread pitting of the rolling elements. Spectral analysis was carried out on the accelerometer data from these helicopters and correlated with the tear-down inspection findings. The fault patterns exhibited correspond well to progressing stages of bearing wear and are consistent across defective gearboxes from different helicopters. It is demonstrated that simple spectral analysis can be effective in tracking progressive stages of bearing damage using both low-frequency and high-frequency bandwidths. The observed fault patterns are extracted as features for diagnosis and used to determine the bearings' estimated time to failure for maintenance planning...|$|R
50|$|Weighted {{down with}} guilt and seeking to free {{himself from his}} past, the Doctor has {{departed}} from the TARDIS in {{a subset of the}} ship which takes the form of Lao Tzu’s Jade Pagoda. Ruby isn’t sure what to make of the Doctor, but accompanies him when he finds a <b>maintenance</b> <b>shaft</b> leading out of the engine room up to the bridge. There, the captain and first mate also conclude that the Doctor must be a stowaway, and the Doctor, seeking to prove his credentials, learns that they are near Snowcap Tracking Station and asks to speak to General Cutler. It isn’t the same Cutler he was somehow expecting, but she proves to be very interested in hearing {{what he has to say}} for himself. Ruby still doesn’t believe the Doctor’s claim to be a time traveller until she accompanies him into the Jade Pagoda, where he finds that his companions have disconnected the main TARDIS’ Time Vector Generator. When he puts it back in place the Jade Pagoda’s interior dimensions are restored, much to Ruby’s shock, but due to the disconnection of the TVG, the Jade Pagoda’s structure is degrading, and it will be forced to return to the parent body of the TARDIS prematurely.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{arriving}} to the Boundary (the name {{given to the}} ancient wall protecting the city), Ivan is accepted into the Warrior Satt. Meanwhile, Flora calms down and realizes that Ivan {{was only trying to}} protect her. She remembers {{that he was trying to}} find out more about the colonys past and asks her friend Nicolai Lorgen, a Chosen, to retrieve the information from his satts archives. In the attempt to please Flora, with whom he has long been enamored, Nick copies the data onto a service droid and sends it to Floras house. However, he is caught by his father Richard Lorgen, who decides to punish his son and tells Kelgan about it. Kelgan sends droids to assassinate Flora and Ivan. Due to some quick thinking, Flora survives the attempt and uses the <b>maintenance</b> <b>shafts</b> running under the City to get to the Boundary, along with her friends Ryben (a Metamorph) and Nive (an Emglan) and the service droid. Ivan is out on nightly patrol of the Boundary when an assassin droid tries to kill him with a sniper rifle. Unlike the locals, Tamantsev trusts technology more than his senses, and that is what saves him. After destroying the droid, he reunited with Flora and asks Lymel, the head of the Warrior Satt to give him a vehicle for traveling outside the city. After examining the wreckage of the Phantom, Ivan confirms his suspicions that his entire escape from Ganio was orchestrated by someone who wants access to Doom. He reads through the data from the service droid and discovers that Satt Valtorn disappeared after departing on an expedition to a set of alien buildings not too far from the colony. They head to a complex of ancient structures on a plateau, nicknamed the Claw by the colonists. On the way there, Ivan experiences a set of visions, which are actually data implanted in his brain during his service in the Confederate special forces and activated by certain visual cues. He puts the pieces together and realizes that Doom is a site of an ancient bio-lab set up by the Harammins 3 million years ago to develop bio-weapons in their fight against the Insects. The planet Paradise, visited by humans earlier, was a test site for one of their experiments to create shapeshifters (see novel Paradise Lost). The research was abandoned following the isolation of the OHara cluster, although it did yield an unexpected side effect — the Harramin Holy Grail, immortality. Now, someone wants to learn the secret of immortality at any cost.|$|R
