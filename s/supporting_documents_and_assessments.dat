To retrieve such entity, people usually first locate a small set of <b>support</b> <b>documents</b> which contain answer entities, and then further detect the answer entities in this set. In the literature, people view the <b>support</b> <b>documents</b> as relevant <b>documents,</b> <b>and</b> their findings as a conventional document retrieval problem. In this paper, we will state that finding <b>support</b> <b>documents</b> <b>and</b> that of relevant documents, although sounds similar, have important differences. Further, we propose a logistic regression approach to find <b>support</b> <b>documents.</b> Our experiment {{results show that}} the logistic regression method performs significantly better than a baseline system that treat the <b>support</b> <b>document</b> finding as a conventional document retrieval problem...|$|R
