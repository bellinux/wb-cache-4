5000|$|<b>Slew-induced</b> <b>distortion</b> (SID) {{can produce}} {{intermodulation}} distortion (IMD) {{when the first}} signal is slewing (changing voltage) at the limit of the amplifier's power bandwidth product. This induces an effective reduction in gain, partially amplitude-modulating the second signal. If SID only occurs {{for a portion of}} the signal, it is called [...] "transient" [...] intermodulation distortion.|$|E
50|$|In this context, {{distortion}} {{refers to}} any kind of deformation of an output waveform compared to its input, usually clipping, harmonic distortion, or intermodulation distortion (mixing phenomena) caused by non-linear behavior of electronic components and power supply limitations. Terms for specific types of nonlinear audio distortion include: crossover distortion, <b>slew-Induced</b> <b>Distortion</b> (SID) and transient intermodulation (TIM).|$|E
50|$|<b>Slew-induced</b> <b>distortion</b> (SID or slew-rate induced distortion) {{is caused}} when an {{amplifier}} or transducer {{is required to}} change output (or displacement), i.e. slew rate, faster than {{it is able to}} do so without error. At such times any other signals may suffer considerable gain distortion, leading to intermodulation distortion. Transient intermodulation distortion may involve some degree of SID and/or distortion due to peak compression.|$|E
5000|$|For {{some years}} {{following}} the introduction of solid state amplifiers, their perceived sound {{did not have the}} excellent audio quality of the best valve amplifiers (see valve audio amplifier). This led audiophiles to believe that [...] "tube sound" [...] or valve sound had an intrinsic quality due to the vacuum tube technology itself. In 1970, Matti Otala published a paper on the origin of a previously unobserved form of distortion: transient intermodulation distortion (TIM), later also called <b>slew-induced</b> <b>distortion</b> (SID) by others. TIM distortion was found to occur during very rapid increases in amplifier output voltage.|$|E
40|$|Recently, Volterra {{theory for}} {{handling}} nonlinear phenomena has been freed of {{its inability to}} treat, satisfactorily, saturating systems {{by the introduction of}} rational Volterra theory. This, combined with the present availability of parameter estimation techniques for the identification of systems set up around traditional Volterra theory, makes it now possible to develop a method to determine parametric models, describing saturations for a large range of input amplitude. The technique is illustrated on an inverting amplifier which causes <b>slew-induced</b> <b>distortion.</b> SCOPUS: cp. pinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Methods of {{digital-to-analogue}} conversion {{are reviewed}} with a bias towards multi-bit and bitstream conversion. Sources of error are identified {{and a number}} of conversion techniques presented. Included are basic architectures for multi-bit systems and the use of oversampling and noise shaping. This progression leads to a discussion of the deltasigma converter with open-loop variants using code conversion. Finally, the methods are contrasted against the PWM convener as an alternative means of generating a binary coded data sequence that can simplify the digital-analogue gateway. Consideration is also given to analogue factors that affect resolution. 0 INTRODUCTION because of the availability of low-cost digital signal The performance of a digital audio reproduction system processing.
