25|$|In the US and Europe, bacon is {{commonly}} used as a condiment or topping on other foods, often {{in the form of}} bacon bits. Streaky bacon is more commonly used as a topping in the US on such items as pizza, salads, sandwiches, hamburgers, baked potatoes, hot dogs, and soups. In the US, sliced <b>smoked</b> <b>back</b> bacon is used less frequently than the streaky variety, but can sometimes be found on pizza, salads, and omelettes.|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{development}} of smokeless stoves for application in Nepal. The aim of the study is to identify feasible ways of utilising computational fluid dynamic software to assist in the development of cookstove designs. In light of this, a holistic understanding of the present situation in Nepal has been sought after. The Nepali Insert Stove design was selected for CFD simulation and analysis. Once the effects of natural convection and turbulence throughout the model were accounted for, the process of optimising the design with a goal of reducing the amount of <b>smoke</b> <b>back</b> drafted from the stove’s front door, was investigated. An optimum baffle angle of 40 ° was found to induce the smallest amount of <b>smoke</b> <b>back</b> drafted into the room where the stove would be located. It is concluded that the study brings light of a feasible and concurrent method of cookstove development. It is however recommended that experimental data is gathered and further research into other designs and geometry variations is conducted prior to making modifications to th...|$|R

50|$|Air {{curtains}} {{are also}} used to control the release of smoke particulates into the environment. After a natural disaster, or during brush clearing activities, debris is disposed of by incineration in either a ceramic or earth pit containment. Just as an air curtain serves to separate indoor air from outdoor air as, for instance, in restaurants and walk-in refrigerators, a powerful air curtain can defeat the chimney effect of the incineration process to eliminate any smoke from a brush incinerator. The air curtain acts as a lid on the process, and forces the <b>smoke</b> <b>back</b> into the fuel bed for a cleaner burn.|$|R

40|$|The {{designers}} of tunnels must provide comfortable conditions for occupants. This necessitates particularly {{the development of}} ventilation equipments well suited for routine operation but also efficient {{in the case of}} accidental fires while a t the same time offering the possibility of control. A computer model for simulation of fire growth and <b>smoke</b> <b>back</b> flow phenomenon countering the effect of ventilation is described. I t permits one to predict the length of the reverse layer under a ceiling as a function of two main parameters: ventilation speed and rate of heat release of the fire. Special attention is devoted to the description of the fire source with consideration of the interaction between flow and the chemical reaction. The validation of the model against experimental results, obtained previously on a small-scale prototype, appears satisfying. An application to the Paris metro tunnels is also presented. The validity of the predictive results is infered from the similarity between small-scale and real situation based on a scaling procedure...|$|R
50|$|There {{is a large}} brick arch (made from fire brick) {{attached}} to the front wall of the firebox immediately beneath the firetubes. This extends backwards over the front third to half of the firebed. It is supported on arch tubes, thermic syphons, or circulators. The brick arch directs heat, flames, and <b>smoke</b> <b>back</b> over the fire towards {{the rear of the}} firebox. Visible smoke contains unburned combustible carbon particles and combustible gasses. The purpose of this redirection is to cause more complete combustion of these particles and gasses which make the locomotive more efficient and causes less visible smoke to be emitted from the stack. Without the arch, flames and visible smoke would be sucked straight into the firetubes without having been fully burned, causing visible smoke to be emitted at the stack. The brick arch and its supports (arch tubes, thermic syphons, and circulators) require periodic replacement due to the extreme heat they endure.|$|R

60|$|Hepzibah {{attempted}} to enliven matters by {{a fire in}} the parlor. But the storm demon kept watch above, and, whenever a flame was kindled, drove the <b>smoke</b> <b>back</b> again, choking the chimney's sooty throat with its own breath. Nevertheless, during four days of this miserable storm, Clifford wrapt himself in an old cloak, and occupied his customary chair. On the morning of the fifth, when summoned to breakfast, he responded only by a broken-hearted murmur, expressive of a determination not to leave his bed. His sister made no attempt to change his purpose. In fact, entirely as she loved him, Hepzibah could hardly have borne any longer the wretched duty--so impracticable by her few and rigid faculties--of seeking pastime for a still sensitive, but ruined mind, critical and fastidious, without force or volition. It was at least something short of positive despair, that to-day she might sit shivering alone, and not suffer continually a new grief, and unreasonable pang of remorse, at every fitful sigh of her fellow sufferer.|$|R

40|$|It was the {{recession}} that Chinese leaders partially credited {{for helping the}} countryreach its Five Year Plan pollution goals {{for the first time}} in 2008. Meanwhile, energy consumption has been on the decline (though it rose {{for the first time in}} three months in February), along with the demand for Chinese goods. But to put people back to work and maintain its golden number of 8 percent growth, China will pour $ 586 billion into the economy. In the process, it may also pour a lot of concrete, a lot of coal into its engines, and a lot of <b>smoke</b> <b>back</b> into the air. Much of the reason for China’s dirtier stimulus is clear: the country is still developing, and still depends largely on dirty industry and manufacturing for growth. It’s aiming to be more like developed countries, which rely more heavily on cleaner service sectors, like banking or retail. But on the way there, it’s still dirty. And China’s leaders don’t seem to be showing much interest in making that path — and its end result, for that matter — much cleaner right now. A message released during the ongoing annual session of the National People’s Congress (NPC), said, according to Xinhua, that ”saving energy and protecting environment is a big government agenda, though keeping a ’steady and relatively fast’ economic growth is a paramount task amid the global economic crisis. ” That sounds like a pretty blunt dashing of the hopes of environmental groups like the old Beijing NGO Friends of Nature, which sent a letter to the NPC this weekurging a clean stimulus...|$|R
