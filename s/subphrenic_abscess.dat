40|$|Bronchobiliary fistula (BBF) is a tract {{between the}} biliary system and {{bronchial}} tree {{with the presence}} of bile in the bronchus and the sputum. They are rare but serious complications. In most cases, they are caused by hepatic or <b>subphrenic</b> <b>abscesses,</b> resulting from different conditions. Pulmonary symptoms dominate the clinical picture, and the main manifestations are chronic irritant cough, production of greenish sputum, bronchopneumonia, and dyspnea. The diagnosis of BBF can be confirmed by imaging procedures such as biliary scintigraphy with hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography, or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Bronchoscopy can demonstrate the presence of bile in the bronchial tree and may delineate the site of fistula. The treatment strategy for patients with BBF and biliary tract obstruction is the reestablishment of bile drainage, which allows the fistula to heal by reducing intrabiliary pressure. We present two cases of biliary-bronchial fistula, one related to hepatic abscess and the other due to percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage for common bile duct obstruction secondary to inoperable hilar cholangiocarcinoma...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundUtilizing {{laparoscopy}} {{for major}} surgeries such as hepatectomy {{is a relatively}} new concept. Initially, benign pathologies dominated indications for resection. Our experience in an Australian setting with primarily malignant diagnoses is described. MethodsA review of patients' profiles, pathology, surgery and outcome was performed on 35 patients between December 2005 and August 2008. Data were collected and analysed retrospectively from medical records on a pre-designed datasheet. ResultsCommonest indication for resection was colorectal metastasis (54 %), 71 % of all resections were for malignancy. Average operating time was 2 h 31 min (range 30 min– 7 h, 15 min). Major morbidity consisted of one bile leak, two <b>subphrenic</b> <b>abscesses</b> and one pulmonary embolus. There were no deaths. Conversion to open was required in 20 % and two patients required intra-operative blood transfusions. Average length of stay overall was 6. 1 days (range 1 – 27), but as low as 2 days for some left lateral sectionectomies. Cessation of parenteral analgesia, return to normal diet and full mobility were achieved on average at 2. 4, 2. 3 and 2. 8 days. Significant post-operative liver dysfunction was seen in two patients, which returned to normal by discharge. One patient died of disease progression 4 months after surgery. There were two involved margins in 35 patients (6 %). ConclusionsLaparoscopic hepatectomy is a developing and safe technique in a select group of patients including those with malignancies, resulting in short hospital stays, rapid return to normal diet, full mobility and minimal morbidity with acceptable oncological parameters. This study is not comparative in nature, but provides evidence to support further investigation and establishment of this new technique for liver resection...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{determined}} if {{more radical}} surgery with extended lymphadenectomy improves {{the results of}} gastrectomy in patients with adenocarcinoma of the gastric antrum. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The overall survival in patients with gastric cancer is disappointing. Improved survival has been reported by Japanese authors. Whether {{this is because of}} a higher number of early gastric cancers in the Japanese series, different biologic behavior in Asians, or the adoption of radical surgery with lymphadenectomy remains unclear. METHODS: R 1 subtotal gastrectomy with omentectomy and R 3 total gastrectomy (omentectomy, splenectomy, distal pancreatectomy, lymphatic clearance of the celiac axis, and skeletonization of vessels in the porta hepatis) were evaluated in a prospective, randomized comparison. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were randomized [...] 25 to the R 1 group and 30 to the R 3 group. The two groups were comparable for age, sex, tumor size, TNM stage, and length of follow-up. The R 3 group had a longer operating time (140 vs. 260 min; p < 0. 05), a greater transfusion requirement (0 vs. 2 units, p < 0. 05) and a longer hospital stay (8 vs. 16 days; p < 0. 05) (medians; Mann-Whitney U test). The only postoperative death was in the R 3 group and was caused by intra-abdominal sepsis. Fourteen patients in the R 3 group developed left <b>subphrenic</b> <b>abscesses.</b> There were no major complications in the R 1 group. Overall survival was significantly better in the R 1 group (median survival estimated by Kaplan-Meier method, 1511 vs. 922 days, p < 0. 05, log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: R 3 total gastrectomy can be performed with a low mortality, but it has a high morbidity because of intra-abdominal sepsis. The data do not support the routine use of R 3 total gastrectomy for treatment of patients with antral cancer...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} results of hepatic {{resection}} for hepatolithiasis. Design: A retrospective study of case records of patients with hepatolithiasis undergoing hepatic resection. These patients had been followed up for 3 to 38 months. They were referred to Queen Mary Hospital, a tertiary referral center in Hong Kong. Patients: Of 172 patients with hepatolithiasis seen between January 1984 and December 1981, 63 patients underwent hepatic resection because the affected liver segments were destroyed by repeated infection (n= 51), multiple cholangitic liver abscesses {{were found in the}} affected liver segments (n= 9), or concomitant intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma was diagnosed (n= 3). Intervention: Left lateral segmentectomy was performed in 42 patients, left hepatic lobectomy in 15 patients, right hepatic lobectomy in one patient, and segmentectomy in five patients. Main Outcome Measures: Postoperative morbidity and mortality analysis. Results: Contrary to hepatic resection in a normal liver, dissection to isolate inflow and outflow vasculature was difficult in 52 % of cases owing to severe inflammatory fibrosis at the liver hilum, at the umbilical fissure, or at the junction of hepatic vein with inferior vena cava. The operative morbidity rate was 32 % and the mortality rate was 2 %. The majority of complications were wound infection, <b>subphrenic</b> <b>abscesses,</b> or biliary fistulas, which could be due to the presence of infected bile (85 %) and liver abscesses (25 %) in this disease. Statistical analysis of the preoperative hematological and biochemical variables and the amount of intraoperative blood loss could not identify any factor with significance in correlating with the development of postoperative complications. Stones recurred in 16 % after a median follow-up of 47 months. Conclusion: Hepatic resection is a satisfactory treatment for hepatolithiasis. The postoperative septic complication rate is high and is an intrinsic problem related to liver resection in a septic condition. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Amebiasis can be {{considered}} the most aggressive disease of the human intestine, responsible in its invasive form for clinical syndromes, ranging from the classic dysentery of acute colitis to extra-intestinal disease, with emphasis on hepatic amebiasis, unsuitably named amebic liver abscess. Found worldwide, with a high incidence in India, tropical regions of Africa, Mexico and other areas of Central America, it has been frequently reported in Amazonia. The trophozoite reaches the liver through the portal system, provoking enzymatic focal necrosis of hepatocytes and multiple micro-abscesses that coalesce to develop a single lesion whose central cavity contains a homogeneous thick liquid, with typically reddish brown and yellow color similar to "anchovy paste". Right upper quadrant pain, fever and hepatomegaly are the predominant symptoms of hepatic amebiasis. Jaundice is reported in cases with multiple lesions or a very large abscess, and it affects the prognosis adversely. Besides chest radiography, ultrasonography and computerized tomography have brought remarkable contributions to the diagnosis of hepatic abscesses. The conclusive diagnosis is made however by the finding of Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites in the pus and by the detection of serum antibodies to the amoeba. During the evolution of hepatic amebiasis, {{in spite of the}} availability of highly effective drugs, some important complications may occur with regularity and are a result of local perforation with extension into the pleural and pericardium cavities, causing pulmonary abscesses and purulent pericarditis, respectively The ruptures into the abdominal cavity may lead to <b>subphrenic</b> <b>abscesses</b> and peritonitis. The treatment of hepatic amebiasis is made by medical therapy, with metronidazole as the initial drug, followed by a luminal amebicide. In patients with large abscesses, showing signs of imminent rupture, and especially those who do not respond to medical treatment, a percutaneous drainage must be performed with either ultrasound or computerized tomography guidance. Surgical drainage by laparotomy is reserved to patients with secondary infections...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Some {{reports have}} {{suggested}} that laparoscopic splenectomy (LS) can be successfully performed in adults. However, several aspects of this procedure remain as yet undefined; therefore, several {{attempts have been made}} to modify the standard technique to try to optimize the procedure. Herein we analyze our experience with 105 laparoscopic splenectomies. METHODS: From 1993 to 2000, 105 patients underwent LS at our hospital. Twelve of these patients also underwent a concomitant cholecystectomy. There were 66 women and 39 men whose ages ranged between 4 and 78 years (median, 27. 7). All patients underwent an elective laparoscopic splenectomy. Seventy five patients had thrombocytopenia (ITP), 14 had hereditary spherocytosis, eight were affected by b-thalassemia, two had splenic cysts, two had lymphoma, (two had myeloid chronic leukemia, one patient presented with a splenic abscess and one had incurred an iatrogenic spleen lesion during adrenalectomy. The first patients in this series were positioned in dorsal decubitus; however, as the team's experience increased, the right lateral decubitus became the position of choice because it provides better exposure of the splenic hilum. This procedure requires the use of only four trocars. RESULTS: Mean operating time was 95 min (range, 35 - 320). Hospital stay ranged from 2 to 21 days (median, 4. 5). There was only one conversion to open surgery. One patient died in the postoperative period due to the evolution of a preexisting malignant disease. We recorded nine complications-four <b>subphrenic</b> <b>abscesses,</b> two cases of pleuritis, two episodes of postoperative bleeding, and one intestinal infarction 16 days after surgery. Only two patients needed redo surgery. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that the laparoscopic approach is a valid alternative to open splenectomy, but mastery of some of the technical details of this procedure could greatly help avoid its complications. On the basis of our experience, it seems that the lateral approach should be considered the position of choice because it provides exposure and easier dissection of the splenic hilar structures. We also found that a 30 degrees scope and an ultrasonic dissector allowed for perfect vision and optimal hemostasis during the procedure. At the end of procedure, the spleen should be fragmented and then extracted using an extraction bag...|$|R

The causative organism was multidrug resistant Escherichia coli. Percutaneous pigtail drainage together with IV antibiotics failed to resolve the abscess which persisted for 4  months. Intracavitary doxycycline injection causes moderate reduction in the volume of the drained fluid. This was followed by percutaneous cyanoacrylate injection inside the abscess cavity and the fistulous tract which causes complete resolution of the abscess...|$|E

The flora {{is found to}} be very complex, predominantly anaerobic, and importantly dependent on diet. An etiologic role for colon bacteria in colon cancer is suggested by correlations between epidemiologic data and prevalent dietary patterns and stool culture findings. Cultures from aspiration pneumonia, <b>subphrenic</b> <b>abscess,</b> and other intra-abdominal sepsis all yield anaerobes, and for best results antibiotic therapy should combat them as well as aerobes...|$|E
