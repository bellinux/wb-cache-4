50|$|Epigenetic {{inheritance}} {{may only}} affect fitness if it predictably alters a trait under selection. Evidence has been forwarded that environmental stimuli are important {{agents in the}} alteration of epigenes. Ironically, Darwinian evolution may act on these neo-Lamarckian acquired characteristics {{as well as the}} cellular mechanisms producing them (e.g. methyltransferase genes).Epigenetic inheritance may confer a fitness benefit to organisms that deal with environmental changes at intermediate timescales. <b>Short-cycling</b> changes are likely to have DNA-encoded regulatory processes, as the probability of the offspring needing to respond to changes multiple times during their lifespans is high. On the other end, natural selection will act on populations experiencing changes on longer-cycling environmental changes. In these cases, if epigenetic priming of the next generation is deleterious to fitness over most of the interval (e.g. misinformation about the environment), these genotypes and epigenotypes will be lost. For intermediate time cycles, the probability of the offspring encountering a similar environment is sufficiently high without substantial selective pressure on individuals lacking a genetic architecture capable of responding to the environment. Naturally, the absolute lengths of short, intermediate, and long environmental cycles will depend on the trait, the length of epigenetic memory, and the generation time of the organism.Much of the interpretation of epigenetic fitness effects centers on the hypothesis that epigenes are important contributors to phenotypes, which remains to be resolved.|$|E
40|$|A {{rooftop unit}} (RTU) is {{typically}} {{referred to as}} a unitary system, which employs direct-expansion (DX) air-condensing equipment for cooling and then provides the conditioned air to the space through dedicated air distribution system. Over the years, the DX RTU has wide applications due to its greater flexibility, lower installation cost, and more useful space. System challenges may include reliability, noise, vibration, and humidity control; however, most of these issues have been resolved by technology advancements. One challenge, the compressor 2 ̆ 2 <b>short-cycling,</b> 2 ̆ 2 has not been successfully solved with satisfactory partial load performance and minimum initial cost. This excessive on/off cycling drastically reduces the compressor reliability and increases space humidity. ^ The problem is attributed to the system load modulation not matching the building load variation. Although significant progress has been made to resolve <b>short-cycling,</b> current methods cannot provide a satisfactory solution. Dr. Mingsheng Liu (2004) developed and patented (US 60 / 701, 608) an advanced control algorithm to resolve the DX RTU 2 ̆ 7 s short cycling. This algorithm is based on the fundamental vapor compression theory that different evaporating temperatures will produce varied refrigeration effects. Elimination of the system cycling may be achieved by optimizing supply air temperature reset to match building load condition. ^ This research develops and justifies this advanced control algorithm. A mathematic model has been built to simulate the system performance loads for different weather conditions. Results show <b>short-cycling</b> to be completely eliminated under various operating conditions with no extra energy cost under higher load or humid weather condition and significant savings under the lower load or dry weather condition. In addition, field investigation has been conducted in a functioning office building, which further proves the effectiveness of this advanced control algorithm. ...|$|E

The eyes moved rhythmically from one side to another, without pausing in the lateral positions. This phenomenon has been described as "ping pong gaze" (PPG), referring to <b>short-cycling</b> periodic alternating gaze with smooth eye deviations. In the present patient, however, a saccadic type of PPG could be continued by oculography. Possible clinical and pathophysiological implications are discussed...|$|E
30|$|In Section  3.2, linear state {{equations}} are developed by solving CFPEs using FDM, which is helpful for designing control systems. The proposed aggregate model {{is applied to}} regulation services. The control strategy proposed in [14] is used in this paper. The aggregator collects information about air conditioning loads, such as their working state (“on” or “off”), the indoor temperature and so on. The control signal is decided by the aggregate model and the control strategy includes a lock time constraint to avoid <b>short-cycling</b> of devices. The control signal, which is a scalar ρ∈[−  1,  1], is broadcast to the controlled air conditioners. If an air conditioner is working in the “off” state and ρ is positive, the air conditioner will have probability ρ of turning “on” provided it is not locked. If the air conditioner is working in the “on” state and ρ is negative, the air conditioner will have probability –ρ of turning “off”.|$|E
40|$|In the Chinese hamster, 17 days, i. e. one {{cycle of}} the seminiferous epithelium, after two {{injections}} of [3 H]TdR given 24 hr apart, labelled cells were found among all types of spermatogonia, including stem cells (As). These labelled As spermatogonia derive from one or more self-renewing divisions of the stem cells that originally incorporated [3 H]TdR. In the steady state, half of the divisions of the As will be self-renewing {{and the other half}} will give rise to Apr spermatogonia that will ultimately become spermatozoa. Theoretically, the labelling index (LI) after 17 days will be similar to that after 1 hr, and in this study twice as high as for the 1 -hr interval since only one injection was given. However, experimental values only half that of the theoretical LI were found after 17 days. The following causes for the loss of labelled stem cells are discussed: (1) dilution of label because of division; (2) influx of unlabelled components of false pairs (i. e. newborn stem cells that still have to migrate away, mostly during G 1, from their sister cells and are scored as Apr spermatogonia) between 1 hr and 17 days; (3) the existence of long- and <b>short-cycling</b> stem cells, probably combined with preferential differentiation of the <b>short-cycling</b> elements; (4) selective segregation of DNA at stem cell mitosis; and (5) irradiation death of radiosensitive labelled stem cells. As it is not impossible that factors 1, 2, 4 and 5 together account for the total loss of labelled stem cells, LI results do not provide evidence for the existence of separate classes of short- and long-cycling stem cells. The distributions of the LIs of the As, Apr and Aal spermatogonia over the stages of the epithelial cycle at 17 days are similar to those at 1 hr after injection. Hence the regulatory mechanisms that govern the stimulation and inhibition of proliferation of As that give rise to new As for the next epithelial cycle {{are similar to those of}} the As that will divide into Apr spermatogonia during the same epithelial cycle. Grain counts revealed that more [3 H]TdR is incorporated into As, Apr and Aal spermatogonia that are in S phase during epithelial stages X-IV than in stages V-I...|$|E
40|$|NASA {{recently}} assembled {{one of the}} world's fastest operational supercomputers to {{meet the}} agency's new high performance computing needs. This large-scale system, named Columbia, consists of 20 interconnected SGI Altix 512 -processor systems, {{for a total of}} 10, 240 Intel Itanium- 2 processors. High-fidelity CFD simulations were performed for the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) computer room at Ames Research Center. The purpose of the simulations was to assess the adequacy of the existing air handling and conditioning system and make recommendations for changes {{in the design of the}} system if needed. The simulations were performed with NASA's OVERFLOW- 2 CFD code which utilizes overset structured grids. A new set of boundary conditions were developed and added to the flow solver for modeling the roomls air-conditioning and proper cooling of the equipment. Boundary condition parameters for the flow solver are based on cooler CFM (flow rate) ratings and some reasonable assumptions of flow and heat transfer data for the floor and central processing units (CPU). The geometry modeling from blue prints and grid generation were handled by the NASA Ames software package Chimera Grid Tools (CGT). This geometric model was developed as a CGT-scripted template, which can be easily modified to accommodate any changes in shape and size of the room, locations and dimensions of the CPU racks, disk racks, coolers, power distribution units, and mass-storage system. The compute nodes are grouped in pairs of racks with an aisle in the middle. High-speed connection cables connect the racks with overhead cable trays. The cool air from the cooling units is pumped into the computer room from a sub-floor through perforated floor tiles. The CPU cooling fans draw cool air from the floor tiles, which run along the outside length of each rack, and eject warm air into the center isle between the racks. This warm air is eventually drawn into the cooling units located near the walls of the room. One major concern is that the hot air ejected to the middle isle might recirculate back into the cool rack side and cause thermal <b>short-cycling.</b> The simulations analyzed and addressed the following important elements of the computer room: 1) High-temperature build-up in certain regions of the room; 2) Areas of low air circulation in the room; 3) Potential <b>short-cycling</b> of the computer rack cooling system; 4) Effectiveness of the perforated cooling floor tiles; 5) Effect of changes in various aspects of the cooling units. Detailed flow visualization is performed to show temperature distribution, air-flow streamlines and velocities in the computer room...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} known for several years that {{inhibition}} by s'-fluorodeoxyuridine (FdUrd) of DNA synthesis in plasmodia of Physaritm polycephalum delays subsequent nuclear mitosis. To test whether this delay is due to delay in the termination of 5 -phase, we blocked DNA synthesis with FdUrd + uridine for 3 h at different stages of S-phase, and in plasmodia with different cycle times. The results show that in <b>short-cycling</b> plasmodia the delay in mitosis can be as long as 9 h, despite little delay in termination of S-phase, and is longest when plasmodia are blocked in early S-phase. In plasmodia with long cycle times, no mitotic delay following 3 h inhibition by FdUrd of <S-phase is observed. Our results suggest that mitotic delay after pulses of FdUrd is not due to delay in termination of. S-phase, which therefore does not appear to 'gate ' entry into a Gt period of fixed length. The fact that delay is longest after FdUrd blocks in early S-phase suggests that normal progress through S-phase, not its termination, is critical for the timing of the subsequent mitosis. This may reflect an obligate coupling between replica-tion and transcription of specific genes needed for progress toward mitosis. The lack of mitotic delay in long-cycling plasmodia shows that S-phase-coupled processes need not act as 'timers' if other processes become rate-limiting...|$|E
40|$|The National Energy Code of Canada for Buildings 2015 (NECB), {{published}} by NRC and {{developed by the}} Canadian Commission on Building and Fire Codes in collaboration with Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), sets out technical requirements for the energy efficient design and construction of new buildings. The NECB 2015 includes over ninety changes improving the overall energy performance of buildings over the 2011 edition. The 2015 edition broadens the scope to address all service water and introduces requirements for pressure-sensing controls which reduce the <b>short-cycling</b> of booster pumps when demand for water is low. Other HVAC and service water changes include equipment efficiency regulation of heat rejection equipment, such as cooling towers and (standalone) condensers, heating performance requirements for gas-fired outdoor packaged units and updated minimum pipe and duct insulation requirements. Lighting power density values and controls have been updated with more stringent lighting allowances and additional requirements for common spaces and exterior applications. The performance path modeling rules and guidance have been updated to reflect the changes to the prescriptive path {{as well as more}} current typical use profiles of buildings. Application of the code for residential and small buildings has also been clarified. The NECB 2015 has been re-organized to consolidate relevant information. Each Part now contains the Prescriptive Requirements, followed by the Attribution Table and related (appendix) Notes. The NECB is a must-have for building designers, energy consultants and subcontractors, construction professionals and regulatory officials. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{performance}} of a dual tank solar-assisted heat pump (SAHP) system. These systems combine solar thermal collectors (STCs) and a heat pump (HP) into a hybrid system to meet building thermal loads. The main goals of a system of this type are to reduce energy consumption and provide a method to deliver thermal energy with sustainable sources. This research project undertook the design, testing, model creation and tuning, performance evaluation, and optimization of a dual tank SAHP system for domestic hot water (DHW). The novel SAHP configuration developed uses a second thermal storage tank to create more modes of operation with the intent of decreasing the amount of purchased energy. A key aspect of the work was a test apparatus built at the University of Waterloo (UW) to facilitate equipment testing and mapping, identify operational problems such as HP <b>short-cycling,</b> and tune mode components. Alternatives were modelled in TRNSYS to develop design recommendations and assess economic justification for the dual tank SAHP system. Despite noticeable electricity savings by these systems, an analysis of tolerable capital cost versus electricity cost shows that SAHP systems are not justifiable for single family dwellings at the current time. The impact of electricity time-of-use charges was investigated, which revealed that the DHW, SDHW, and single tank SAHP systems consume a similar amount of electricity during off-peak hours. The performance of the dual tank SAHP system in many global climate types was assessed to identify locations best suited for such a system. Many recommendations are provided to improve economic justification of the system. Overall, the performance benefits of a dual tank SAHP system over the alternatives was demonstrated. Due to the high capital costs of the additional equipment required, economic justification is difficult for a single-family residential application. There are promising applications and system augmentations that should be investigated which can lead to a successful demonstration project of a dual tank solar-assisted heat pump system...|$|E
40|$|Luteal {{insufficiency}} {{is characterized}} by a premature decrease of serum progesterone concentration and pregnancy loss during the luteal phase. Hypoluteoidism is discussed as a possible cause of pregnancy loss in dogs that resorb, abort, or whelp prematurely without visible infectious or non-infectious abnormalities of the pregnancy. Luteal insufficiency in the bitch usually first occurs during the second pregnancy and is accompanied by individual shortening of the estrous cycle and unnoticed resorption within the early stage of gestation. The reasons for hypoluteoidism still remained unclear. Interestingly, antibodies against progesterone and estrogen were found in the sera of women with autoimmune progesterone dermatitis and lymphocytes could be found in the corpora lutea of different species. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the concentration of progesterone, prolactin, and relaxin in hypoluteoid bitches and control animals in the early luteal phase in pregnancy and the nonpregnant-cycle. Moreover, canine antibodies against progesterone were analyzed regarding a possible connection between embryonic loss associated with hormone changes related to a hormone antibody response. A new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was developed and optimized in this regard. Serum samples from 20 <b>short-cycling</b> bitches and 18 control animals were examined particularly in regard to the prevalence of IgE and IgM against progesterone. As another part of this investigation, tissue samples from the corpora lutea of four luteal insufficient and two control animals were collected during ovariohysterectomy. The expression of selected parameters of the prostaglandin system and accordingly immunological cell surface molecules was assessed by Real Time PCR. The results show that the progesterone decline was not associated with a lack of the luteotropic hormones prolactin and relaxin. The expression of the parameters from the prostaglandin system did not differ between the luteal insufficient and control group. Moreover, a possible influence of the immune system on the disturbed luteal function could be demonstrated in this study. Antibodies against progesterone could be detected in the sera of bitches for the first time. The analysis of IgE seems to be most suitable to detect canine anti-progesterone antibodies in connection with luteal insufficiency. Furthermore, the expression of CD 25 mRNA could be detected also in the canine ovary and may indicate the presence of regulatory T-cells in the corpus luteum. The analysis of the additional immunological cell surface molecules showed a high expression of CD 3, CD 4, CD 8 and CD 25 in the bitch with IgE antibodies against progesterone. A higher expression of CD 25 in all luteal insufficient bitches could be observed as a general tendency in comparison to the control animals. The presented data show that neither a disturbed secretion of luteotrophic hormones nor a dysfunction in gene expression of the prostaglandin system were causally related to luteal insufficiency of the examined bitches. However, an autoreactive process could be identified in connection with hypoluteoidism for the first time. This preliminary research may act as a base for optimized assay systems to detect autoimmune reaction in connection with fertility problems and could lead to a reduction in diagnostic errors...|$|E
