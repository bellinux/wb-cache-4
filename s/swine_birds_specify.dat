The novel Influenza virus (A/H 1 N 1) which involved many populations of the world in 2009 is a sort of triple reassortment between <b>swine,</b> <b>bird</b> and human viruses. Given the important role of hemagglutinin in the infectivity of influenza virus, genome sequencing of this protein and investigation of its changes seems necessary. Material and Method: In this experimental study, the viral genome was extracted from clinical throat swab samples, in which the presence of swine influenza genome has been confirmed by Real-time PCR according to WHO protocol in Influenza Research Lab, Pasteur Institute of Iran. Full-length of HA genome was amplified using specific primers by one step-RT-PCR, cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector followed by identification with restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing. Results: Full genome of novel influenza A/H 1 N 1 from clinical samples was amplified by PCR and the expected 1777 bp segment PCR product was visualized by electrophoresis, gel purified, cloned into pGEM-TEasy vector and then sequenced.

40|$|Influenza virus infection, one of {{the most}} com-mon {{infectious}} diseases is a highly contagious airborne disease that causes an acute febrile ill-ness and results invariable degrees of syste-mic symptoms, ranging from mild fatigue to re-spiratory failure and death. In addition to humans, influenza also infects a variety of animal species. Influenza A viruses also can infect domestic ani-mals (pigs, horses, dogs, chickens and ducks) and some wild birds. Some of these influenza strains are species specific, but new strains of influenza may spread from other animal species to humans. These deadly strains produced 3 global pandemics in the last century, the worst of which occurred in 1918. Three pandemics of influenza have swept the world since the “Spa-nish ” flu of 1918, the “Asian ” flu pandemic of 1957, the “Hong Kong ” flu pandemic of 1968, the “Swine ” flu pandemic that began in April of 2009. The pandemic of 1957 probably made more peo-ple sick than the one of 1918, but the availability of antibiotics to treat the secondary infections that are the usual cause of death resulted in a much lower death rate.

40|$|If {{influenza}} is {{a riddle}} wrapped in mystery inside an enigma, then the viral genes are the riddle, the variable surface antigens {{for which they}} code are the mystery, and the course and cause of epidemics the ultimate enigma. E. D. Kilbourne Influenza is a zoonosis of <b>swine,</b> <b>birds,</b> horses, and humans. Influenza probably existed among mammals and birds in antiquity. As animals became domesticated and human populations became concentrated in urban centers, the transfer of influenza from the zoonotic to the human realm is easy to imagine. Because immunity is short lived because of antigenic drift and antigenic shift, influenza can maintain itself in less concentrated populations. Infectious diseases that confer permanent immunity (eg, measles, smallpox) require large populations to maintain themselves, because after repeated attacks, most susceptible individuals are children {{who have not been}} exposed previously. For this reason, influenza affects all ages because of the ephemeral nature of influenza immunity [1 – 4]. In contrast to plague or smallpox, influenza has the potential for rapid spread. Pandemics can spread from continent to continent and across the world in a few months. Excluding pandemics, influenza epidemics are usually mild, with high attack rates but relatively low rates of mortality (approximately 1 %). Although most people in an unimmunized population may be affected by influenza, viral influenza is most severe in women during their second or third trimester of pregnancy, the very young, the elderly, and immunosuppressed individuals. The total percentage of deaths attributable Infect Dis Clin N Am 18 (2004) 141 – 155 to influenza varies and ranges from 1 % to 20 %. With large segments of the population affected, even a mortality rate of 1 % results in a staggering number of deaths.

Pandemics are global epidemics among humans caused by the transmission of novel influenza A viruses generated via inter-species transmission. For an influenza A virus to cause a pandemic, the virus must cause human illness, the population must have little or no protective immunity against the virus, and the virus must spread easily from person to person.

In order to determine the best screening method, a panel of 14 isolates of M. avium subsp. avium and M. avium subsp. hominissuis, were tested for their ability to form biofilm in microtiter plates under different conditions. Subsequently, 83 additional isolates from humans, <b>swine</b> and <b>birds</b> were tested for biofilm formation. The isolates were tested for the presence of selected genes involved in the synthesis of glycopeptidolipids (GPLs) in the cell wall of M. avium, which is believed to be important for biofilm formation. Colony morphology and hsp 65 sequvar were also determined. Results Nine isolates from swine produced biofilm. There was a significant higher frequency of porcine isolates forming biofilm compared to human isolates. All isolates were previously characterised by IS 1311 - and IS 1245 -RFLP typing. The ability to form biofilm did not correlate with the RFLP-type, hsp 65 sequevar, colony morphology or the presence of gene sequences related to GPL synthesis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Since late April, 2009, a novel {{influenza}} virus A (H 1 N 1), generally {{referred to as}} the "swine flu," has spread around the globe and infected hundreds of thousands of people. During the first few days after the initial outbreak in Mexico, extensive media coverage together {{with a high degree of}} uncertainty about the transmissibility and mortality rate associated with the virus caused widespread concern in the population. The spread of an infectious disease can be strongly influenced by behavioral changes (e. g., social distancing) during the early phase of an epidemic, but data on risk perception and behavioral response to a novel virus is usually collected with a substantial delay or after an epidemic has run its course. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report the results from an online survey that gathered data (n = 6, 249) about risk perception of the Influenza A(H 1 N 1) outbreak during the first few days of widespread media coverage (April 28 -May 5, 2009). We find that after an initially high level of concern, levels of anxiety waned along with the perception of the virus as an immediate threat. Overall, our data provide evidence that emotional status mediates behavioral response. Intriguingly, principal component analysis revealed strong clustering of anxiety about <b>swine</b> flu, <b>bird</b> flu and terrorism. All three of these threats receive a great deal of media attention and their fundamental uncertainty is likely to generate an inordinate amount of fear vis-a-vis their actual threat. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that respondents' behavior varies in predictable ways. Of particular interest, we find that affective variables, such as self-reported anxiety over the epidemic, mediate the likelihood that respondents will engage in protective behavior. Understanding how protective behavior such as social distancing varies and the specific factors that mediate it may help with the design of epidemic control strategies...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{population}} dynamics of three antigenically diverse RNA viruses: dengue, influenza and HIV- 1. It comprises a set of studies highlighting the roles of structural constraints on critical antigenic determinants, interactions between immune responses to different antigenic types, host lifespan, {{and the degree of}} mixing between different host populations in determining the epidemiology and within-host dynamics of these pathogen systems. Dengue exists in humans as a collection of four antigenically related serotypes. Although infection by one serotype appears to convey life-long protection to homologous infection, it is believed to be a risk factor for severe disease manifestations upon secondary, heterologous infection due to the phenomenon of Antibody-Dependent Enhancement (ADE). It is not clear if third or fourth infections are possible, and if so, how they contribute to dengue epidemiology. In this thesis, I investigate the effect of third and fourth infections on the transmission dynamics of dengue. By contrast with dengue, human influenza viruses are known to be in rapid antigenic flux, manifesting in the sequential replacement of antigenic types. This pattern of evolution {{does not appear to be}} the same in shorter-lived hosts such as <b>swine</b> and <b>birds.</b> In this thesis, I have used a simple multi-locus model to explore the relationship between host lifespan and viral evolution, as well as to elucidate the effects of transmission between hosts of different lifespan in effort to capture the cross-species element of influenza transmission. My final chapter concerns the within-host evolution of HIV- 1. I propose a new model for the pathogenesis of HIV- 1 where the transition to AIDS is primarily linked to the gradual loss of the ability to make new antibody responses as the CD 4 + population declines. Together these studies emphasise that it is the changing profile of immune responses – either at the population level or within the host – that is the principal determinant of the dynamics of the pathogen, rather than the mode and tempo of antigenic innovation.

The homologous antibody response of the older subjects to equine- 2 / 63 vaccine is more vigorous, reflecting the conditioning effects of prior exposures to equine- 2 / 63 antigens. A "one-way cross" between equine- 2 / 63 virus and A 2 and A 1 strains has been demonstrated. The antigenic ties between strains of influenza A isolated from humans, <b>swine,</b> horses, and <b>birds</b> is recognized and discussed. It is apparent that horses do not constitute an active reservoir for strains of human involvement. The epidemiologic significance of the antigenic linkages between strains isolated from different species remains obscure...|$|R
40|$|Background: The recent avian {{influenza}} epidemic in Asia and the H 1 N 1 pandemic demonstrated that influenza A viruses {{pose a threat}} to global public health. The animal origins of the viruses confirmed the potential for interspecies transmission. Swine are hypothesized to be prime “mixing vessels ” due to the dual receptivity of their trachea to human and avian strains. Additionally, avian and human influenza viruses have previously been isolated in swine. Therefore, understanding interspecies contact on smallholder swine farms and its potential role in the transmission of pathogens such as influenza virus is very important. Methods: This qualitative study aimed to determine swine-associated interspecies contacts in two coastal areas of Peru. Direct observations were conducted at both small-scale confined and low-investment swine farms (n = 36) and in open areas where swine freely range during the day (n = 4). Interviews were also conducted with key stakeholders in swine farming. Results: In both locations, the intermingling of <b>swine</b> and domestic <b>birds</b> was common. An unexpected contact with avian species was that swine were fed poultry mortality in 6 / 20 of the farms in Chancay. Human-swine contacts were common, with a higher frequency on the confined farms. Mixed farming of swine with chickens or ducks was observed in 36 % of all farms. Human-avian interactions were less frequent overall. Use of adequat...|$|R

Plos Pathogens, 11 (6), 6. doi: 10. 1371 /journal. ppat. 1004819 Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are {{important}} zoonotic pathogens that cause epidemic outbreaks in poultry, wild <b>birds,</b> <b>swine,</b> and other mammals. In humans, IAVs cause severe respiratory illness, and zoonotic transmission of IAVs from avian reservoirs poses a constant {{threat to the}} public health, as exemplified by the recent outbreak of an avian IAV of the H 7 N 9 subtype [1]. Aquatic birds {{are considered to be}} the major reservoir of IAVs, and 16 hemagglutinin (HA) and nine neuraminidase (NA) viral subtypes have been isolated from avian species to date. It is now well documented that from time to time IAVs overcome the species barrier and establish new lineages in other animals, including domestic animals, sea mammals, and humans (Fig 1). Our understanding of IAVs was recently challenged by the identification of two novel genome sequences of influenza A-like viruses from bat specimens by next-generation sequencing. These viruses were provisionally designated "H 17 N 10 " (from yellow-shouldered fruit bats [Sturnira lilium] in Guatemala) and "H 18 N 11 " (from flat-faced fruit bats [Artibeus planirostris] in Peru) [2, 3], which might signal an expansion of IAV host range (Fig 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Pandemic influenza: {{a global}} {{challenge}} for social marketing marketing Recent {{years have seen}} increased attention and concern regarding the potential for pandemic influenza, following large-scale outbreaks of <b>swine</b> flu and <b>bird</b> flu. Governments and health agencies have time to develop social marketing strategies and specific messages that {{have the potential to}} minimize fear, refute or inoculate against misinformation that the public may encounter, and enhance the likelihood of the public taking the recommended preventive and remedial actions should these become necessary. This paper presents an overview of how social marketing can be used to tackle the global challenge of pandemic influenza. The potential pandemic influenza poses a major challenge for social marketers (along with governments, health services, and businesses). There are a number of critical factors about a potential pandemic influenza that make it fundamentally different to the majority of issues to which social marketing has previously been applied. The underlying principles of social marketing are equally applicable to a global infectious disease outbreak (such as pandemic influenza). Even if the current strains do not become pandemic, social marketers should use this impetus to develop the skills and resources to address future communicable disease outbreaks. This paper applies the concepts of social marketing to a unique health issue which has the potential {{to become one of the}} largest global public health crises in history, but which can be tackled with effective global social marketing...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{attribution}} of bacterial genotypes {{has become a}} major tool in the investigation of the epidemiology of campylobacteriosis and has implicated retail chicken meat as the major source of human infection in several countries. To investigate the robustness of this approach to the provenance of the reference data sets used, a collection of 742 Campylobacter jejuni and 261 Campylobacter coli isolates obtained from United Kingdom-sourced chicken meat was established and typed by multilocus sequence typing. Comparative analyses of the data with those from other isolates sourced from a variety of host animals and countries were undertaken by genetic attribution, genealogical, and population genetic approaches. The genotypes from the United Kingdom data set were highly diverse, yet structured into sequence types, clonal complexes, and genealogical groups very similar to those seen in chicken isolates from the Netherlands, the United States, and Senegal, but more distinct from isolates obtained from ruminant, <b>swine,</b> and wild <b>bird</b> sources. Assignment analyses consistently grouped isolates from different host animal sources regardless of geographical source; these associations were more robust than geographic associations across isolates from three continents. We conclude that, notwithstanding the high diversity of these pathogens, there is a strong signal of association of multilocus genotypes with particular hosts, which is greater than the geographic signal. These findings are consistent with local and international transmission of host-associated lineages among food animal species and provide a foundation for further improvements in genetic attribution...|$|R
