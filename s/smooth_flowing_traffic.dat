Meanwhile, heavy goods vehicles such as logging trucks, cement trucks, container trucks, construction materials trucks and other heavy goods vehicles (except tanker lorry, provision goods truck, crane, tow truck, fire engine, ambulance, etc.) are banned from using roads, highways, and expressways during festive seasons. A massive nationwide operation known as Ops Selamat (previously called Ops Sikap) is held annually by the Malaysian police to ensure safety on all roads in Malaysia during festive seasons.

40|$|Developments in {{the port}} of Rotterdam will cause a great {{increase}} in shipping traffic in the Maasvlakte, which in its turn raises doubts about the perpetuation of a <b>smooth</b> <b>flow</b> of <b>traffic</b> in this port area. The Rotterdam Municipal Port Management and the Delft University of Technology have therefore set up a joint research project to investigate the potential <b>flow</b> of shipping <b>traffic</b> in the Maasvlakte in the year 2010.

40|$|The {{synchronization}} {{of traffic}} light systems {{is one of}} the best solutions in order to avoid problematic traffic jams. Traffic timing is a major concern when it comes to traffic management. One of the common causes of traffic jams is because of nonsynchronized traffic light systems. Once a light turns green, traffic begins to move, but by the time the moving traffic reaches the next light, the signal is still red. This will disrupt the continuity of the <b>traffic</b> <b>flow,</b> especially for large main roads. The <b>smooth</b> <b>flow</b> of <b>traffic</b> on main routes is important to clear dense traffic in a given time. This study examined the density of vehicles on Jalan Bukit Gambier and also the traffic timing was documented in order to plan out proper re-timing for traffic lights along the studied road. The outcomes of this study support the hypothesis that retiming traffic lights to create a synchronized traffic light system for main roads will greatly improve <b>traffic</b> <b>flow...</b>|$|R
