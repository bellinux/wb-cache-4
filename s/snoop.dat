So his requirements to get to Paris are, like, beyond platinum editions; they're, like, beyond ultra-platinum editions; they're like diamond editions. So we love <b>Snoop</b> and we wish he had been here, but I think shooting him in L.A. will be good because we'll have more time, more control. He probably would have gotten really mobbed in the streets here anyway.|$|E

50|$|IGMP <b>snooping</b> {{allows a}} switch to only forward {{multicast}} traffic to the links that have solicited them. Essentially, IGMP <b>snooping</b> is a layer 2 optimization for the layer 3 IGMP. IGMP <b>snooping</b> takes place internally on switches {{and is not}} a protocol feature. <b>Snooping</b> is therefore especially useful for bandwidth-intensive IP multicast applications such as IPTV.|$|R
50|$|In {{order for}} IGMP, and thus IGMP <b>snooping,</b> to function, a {{multicast}} router must {{exist on the}} network and generate IGMP queries.

Without a querier the tables are not created and <b>snooping</b> will not work. Furthermore, IGMP general queries must be unconditionally forwarded by all switches involved in IGMP <b>snooping.</b> Some IGMP <b>snooping</b> implementations include full querier capability. Others are able to proxy and retransmit queries from the multicast router.|$|R

Knight, a notorious strongman and intimidator, was able to have Eazy-E release Young from his contract and, using Dr.Dre as his flagship artist, founded Death Row Records. In 1992 Young released his first single, the title track to the film Deep Cover, a collaboration with rapper <b>Snoop</b> Dogg, whom he met through Warren G. Dr.Dre's debut solo album was The Chronic, released under Death Row Records with Suge Knight as executive producer.

We also present a detailed specification {{of a new}} protocol called Multicast <b>Snooping</b> [6] and, in doing so, we better illustrate {{the utility of the}} table-based specification methodology. Finally, we demonstrate a technique for verification of the Multicast <b>Snooping</b> protocol, through the sketch of a manual proof that the specification satisfies a sequentially consistent memory model.

50|$|The {{disadvantage}} of bus <b>snooping</b> is limited scalability. Frequent <b>snooping</b> on a cache causes a race with an access from a processor, thus it can increase cache access time and power consumption. Each of the requests {{has to be}} broadcast to all nodes in a system. It means {{that the size of}} the (physical or logical) bus and the bandwidth it provides must grow, as the system becomes larger. Since the bus <b>snooping</b> does not scale well, larger cache coherent NUMA (ccNUMA) systems tend to use directory-based coherence protocols.|$|R

40|$|Symmetric {{multiprocessor}} (SMP) servers provide superior {{performance for}} the commercial workloads that dominate the Internet. Our simulation results show that over one-third of cache misses by these applications result in cache-to-cache transfers, where the data is found in another processor's cache rather than in memory. SMPs are optimized for this case by using <b>snooping</b> protocols that broadcast address transactions to all processors. Conversely, directory-based shared-memory systems must indirectly locate the owner and sharers through a directory, resulting in larger average miss latencies. This paper proposes timestamp <b>snooping,</b> a technique that allows SMPs to i) utilize high-speed switched interconnection networks and ii) exploit physical locality by delivering address transactions to processors and memories without regard to order. Traditional <b>snooping</b> requires physical ordering of transactions. Timestamp <b>snooping</b> works by processing address transactions in a logical order. Logical time is maintained by adding a few bits per address transaction and having network switches perform a handshake to ensure on-time delivery. Processors and memories then reorder transactions based on their timestamps to establish a total order. We evaluate timestamp <b>snooping</b> with commercial workloads on a 16 -processor SPARC system using the Simics full-system simulator. We simulate both an indirect (butterfly) and a direct (torus) network design. For OLTP, DSS, web serving, web searching, and one scientific application, timestamp <b>snooping</b> with the butterfly network runs 6 - 28 % faster than directories, {{at a cost of}} 13 - 43 % more link traffic. Similarly, with the torus network, timestamp <b>snooping</b> runs 6 - 29 % faster for 17 - 37 % more link traffic. Thus, timestamp snoopi [...] ...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION Data <b>snooping</b> {{happens when}} you find {{statistically}} significant but spurious relationships between empirical data. Financial analysis is particularly prone to data <b>snooping</b> because we use large data sets, there are many analysts {{looking at the same}} data, and we sometimes search for statistical relationships without due regard to economic justification [Lo and MacKinlay, 1990; Lo, 1994]. Data <b>snooping</b> is insidious when statistical relationships are sought between financial economic variables whose very complexity can mask the spurious nature of the relationship. By design, it is difficult to give classroom examples of this because {{it is very difficult to}} label a strong statistical relationship betweeneconomic variables as spurious.

40|$|This paper advocates that cache {{coherence}} protocols use a bandwidth adaptive approach {{to adjust to}} varied system configurations (e. g., number of processors) and workload behaviors.

BASH adapts dynamically by probabilistically deciding to broadcast or unicast on a per request basis using a local estimate of recent interconnection network utilization. Simulations of a microbenchmark and commercial and scientific workloads show that BASH robustly performs as well or better than the best of <b>snooping</b> and directory protocols as available bandwidth is varied.
