40|$|A {{total of}} 16 {{patients}} with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer {{were treated with}} <b>sulofenur</b> (LY 186641), a novel oral sulfonylurea. All subjects had received previous chemotherapy. Anaemia occurred in all 16 patients, 14 of whom required a blood transfusion, and 2 / 16 patients received methylene blue for breathlessness due to methaemaglobinaemia. Treatment was discontinued in 2 / 16 cases due to rising liver enzyme values, which reverted to normal on cessation of the drug. There was no nausea or alopecia. Only two minor responses were seen. Plasma drug levels were insufficient to result in anti-tumour activity as extrapolated from animal data. Further studies that attempt to increase the bioavailability and improve the therapeutic index are warranted...|$|E
