40|$|The {{vegetable}} tannins are {{the oldest}} tanning agents used in leather industry. They give their natural character and colour to the leathers {{which they are}} applied to, but they have the disadvantage of colour change when {{they are exposed to}} light for prolonged times. In this study light fastness properties of leathers tanned with mimosa, quebracho, valonea and chestnut tannins were measured. Lightfastness properties of mimosa and quebracho tannins were found lower. Then these tannins were modified with sulphitation, novalac synthesis and sulphomethylation processes. Lightfastness and determination of volatile matter, determination of matter soluble in dichloromethane, determination of <b>sulphated</b> total <b>ash</b> and <b>sulphated</b> water-insoluble <b>ash,</b> determination of water soluble matter, water soluble inorganic matter and water soluble organic matter, determination of nitrogen content and hide substance, calculation of degree of tannage determination of formaldehyde content analyses were performed to the leathers tanned with modified mimosa and quebracho tannins. From comparison of results, it was understood that sulpmethylation process can be used for production of leathers with higher lightfastness and without major change on chemical properties. When chemical properties of leathers tanned with modified quebracho and mimosa are considered: volatile matter, <b>sulphated</b> total <b>ash</b> and <b>sulphated</b> water- insoluble <b>ash,</b> water soluble matter, water soluble inorganic matter and water soluble organic matter, hide substance and formaldehyde contents were found compatible with standard mimosa and quebracho.

High ulvan yield was obtained after combining enzymatic and chemical extraction but the lowest yield results at the drastic conditions (pH 1. 5 and 90 C). Besides, solvent acidity was an important parameter controlling the ulvan extraction efficiency. The different extraction processes affected chemical composition of ulvan extracts and in particular, <b>sulphate,</b> <b>ash</b> and sugar contents. Low proportions of galactose, glucose and protein were also found in sulphated polysaccharides. The extract, which is resulted from combined enzymatic and chemical extraction, was mainly composed of high peak molecular weight polysaccharides. Ulvan hy-drocolloids demonstrated a pseudoplastic behavior. Viscoelastic behavior was carried out at a concen-tration of 1. 6 % (w/v) {{in the presence of}} 7 mM sodium tetraborate and at pH 7. 5.

40|$|Ashes {{produced}} from fluidized bed combustors (FBC) burning high-sulphur fuels often contain 20 – 30 % unreacted CaO {{because of the}} limestone added to remove SO 2 in situ. This paper presents the results from experiments into reactivating partially <b>sulphated</b> FBC <b>ash</b> (both bed ash and fly ash) with liquid water, steam and sodium carbonate. The water- or steam-hydrated ashes were subsequently re-sulphated in a thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) with simulated flue gas. The TGA results show that, while liquid water and steam successfully hydrate and reactivate the unreacted CaO in the bed ash, the treated <b>ashes</b> <b>sulphated</b> to widely different extents. Attempts to reactivate fly ash with hydration failed, although fly ash by itself is extremely reactive. A pilot-scale mini-circulating FBC (CFBC) was also {{used to evaluate the}} results of reactivation on the bed ash by hydrating with liquid water and admixtures of inorganic salt (Na 2 CO 3) in the form of either powder or solution. When the treated ash was re-injected into the combustor with the fuel, the effect on SO 2 removal efficiency was negligible if Na 2 CO 3 was added as powder. Doping with aqueous solution resulted in enhanced SO 2 removal; however, the extent was lower than the level achieved if only water hydration was employed. Increasing the amount of water (from 10 % to 30 %) to reactivate the ash did not improve the sulphur capture capacity in the mini-CFBC. Overall, this study suggests that the most practical way for re-use of the partially <b>sulphated</b> bed <b>ash</b> as a sulphur sorbent is reactivation by water. A proposal for utilization of the fly ash in an economically reasonable way is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|There is overall {{agreement}} that volcanic sulphate aerosols {{in the stratosphere}} can reduce solar radiation reaching the earth’s surface for years, thereby reducing surface temperatures, affecting global circulation patterns and generally the global climate system. However, {{the response of the}} climate system after large volcanic eruptions is not fully understood and global climate models have difficulties to reproduce the observed variability of the earth system after large volcanic eruptions until now.

40|$|Volcanic eruptions are {{the largest}} source of {{variability}} in the stratospheric particle concentration as they inject SO 2 that is subsequently converted into sulphate particles. No major perturbation of the stratospheric aerosol load has been observed since the large eruption of Pinatubo in 1991, but several moderate eruptions after 2000 have caused deviations from stratospheric background conditions. Atmospheric particles are of concern with regard to climate because they scatter and absorb radiation. This thesis presents results from observations of the aerosol in the upper troposphere and stratosphere during the period 1999 - 2013. Measurements of aerosol particles and trace gases were performed with the CARIBIC flying observatory, where instrumentation is installed on a Lufthansa passenger aircraft during monthly intercontinental flights at altitudes of 9 - 12 km. The elemental composition of particles in the diameter range 0. 08 - 2 µm was obtained from sampling and subsequent ion beam analysis (PIXE and PESA). Size distributions of particles with diameters of 0. 12 - 1 µm were measured during flight by an optical particle counter. Lidar observations from the satellite CALIPSO were used to reveal the vertical distribution and global effect of three volcanic eruptions from 2008 to 2011. These observations {{were used to determine}} stratospheric aerosol optical depth and radiative forcing, in order to estimate the climate impact received from the lowermost stratosphere (LMS). It was found that the LMS particle concentrations were on average higher in the years 2005 - 2008 than 1999 - 2002. While the latter period is considered to represent background conditions, the increase in 2005 - 2008 was attributed to three tropical eruptions with subsequent transport of the aerosol into the LMS by the shallow and deep branches of the Brewer–Dobson circulation. In 2008 - 2012, volcanism had considerable impact during due to both extra-tropical and tropical eruptions. Three main components were identified in volcanic particles sampled one week to more than 18 weeks after the eruptions: <b>sulphate,</b> <b>ash</b> and a carbonaceous fraction. The residence time of SO 2 in the stratosphere was estimated to be 45 ± 22 days. The stratosphere below 15 km altitude was found to contribute 55 % to the total stratospheric aerosol optical depth and 42 % to the total aerosol radiative forcing from the Kasatochi (2008), Sarychev (2009) and Nabro (2011) eruptions. Thus, currently used estimates of the impact of volcanic eruptions on climate based on data obtained above 15 km or the 380 K isentrope should be updated to include the effect of volcanism on the LMS. Furthermore, higher concentrations of sulphate particles were observed in the upper troposphere during volcanically influenced periods, with a positive trend in 2001 - 2011. The opposite trend was observed in cirrus cloud reflectance in the same period. This suggests that the volcanic aerosol has a significant indirect effect on climate, which requires further investigation...|$|R

The variations in the amounts of anions using different extraction times during rotary-assisted extraction were minimal for all investigated anions. The efficiency of ultrasound-assisted extraction of anions from coal depended on the sonication time and was highest at 30 min. The ultrasound-assisted extraction was less efficient for the extraction of anions from fly ash than rotary-assisted extraction.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to investigate the}} feasibility of a combined washing-immobilisation process as a means of optimising the disposal of fly ash resulting from municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) in cementitious matrices. Two different types of Italian MSWI fly ash and an ordinary Portland cement (ASTM Type I) were used. Washing pre-treatment of fly ash with water always produces a wastewater that can be successfully treated by reducing the pH to values of 6. 5 - 7. 5. This treatment is capable of removing the detected contaminants (Al, Cd, Pb, Zn) through two different mechanisms: precipitation of aluminium hydroxide and adsorption of cadmium, lead and zinc ions onto floc particles of Al(OH) (3). Setting and leaching tests on cementitious mixes prove that the hazardous sludge produced from wastewater treatment can be completely mixed with washed fly ash and this mixture can be incorporated into cementitious matrices to a great extent (75 wt. % of total solid) without the risks of an unacceptable delay of cement setting and an excessive heavy metals leachability from solidified products. The better performance of the combined washing-immobilisation process as compared to the immobilisation process of unwashed fly ash may be ascribed primarily to the ability of the washing step in promoting the formation of hydrate phases that incorporate and/or convert heavy metal compounds into less reactive forms and, secondarily, to its ability of removing significant amounts of alkali chlorides and <b>sulphates</b> from fly <b>ash.</b> As a result, MSWI fly ash is transformed into a material that adversely affects cement hydration to a much lower extent than unwashed fly ash.

The cement component replaced with PSA at five levels of 0 %, 10 %, 20 %, 30 % and 40 % were cast, and on hardened exposed to varying concentration of sulphates of magnesium, sodium and calcium at four levels of 0 %, 1 %, 3 % and 5 % each for three exposure periods of 62, 92 and 152 days after complete immersion in water for 28 days. Using three replicates in all the tests, a total of 630 cubical (150 mm) specimens were cast and tested. The results revealed that compressive strength increased with increase in curing age but decreased as the PSA contents increased. The design compressive strength was attained with 10 % PSA content {{at the age of}} 28 days. The compressive strength reduction in sulphate solutions was noted to increase significantly (p = 0. 005, R 2 = 0. 995) with increase exposure period and concentration, with the most severe caused by magnesium sulphate and the least by calcium sulphate. The least reduction in compressive strength was experienced with 10 % PSA blended cement concrete. Based on the test results the study concluded that 10 % PSA content is adequate as supplementary cementitious material for structural concrete to be placed in an aggressive sulphate environment.

40|$|EasyMining Sweden AB, a {{subsidiary}} to Ragn-Sells AB, {{has developed a}} new process for treatment of fly ash from {{municipal solid waste incineration}} called Ash 2 Salt, which enables recycling of salts; sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride and ammonium sulphate. To compare this new process with some of today’s fly ash treatment processes available for Swedish and European fly ash a life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed. The functional unit used for the comparison was “treatment or disposal of 1 ton of fly ash” and the environmental impact was compared through four different categories: climate change (kg CO 2 - eq), depletion of abiotic resources (kg Sb-eq), ecotoxicity (CTUe) and human toxicity (CTUh). The results showed that the Ash 2 Salt process had the lowest environmental impact considering all the studied environmental impact categories, which mainly depends {{on the assumption that the}} salts recycled from fly ash replaces conventionally produced salts. The treatment process with the highest environmental impact was the process of stabilising and refilling old salt mines in Germany, mainly because of the long distances of transport. Further on, the environmental impact from recycling the salts from fly ash using the Ash 2 Salt method was compared to conventional salt production processes. The functional unit used for the comparison was “production of 1 kg of salt”. Economic allocation was assessed between the salts from the Ash 2 Salt process. The results showed that for two of the impact categories (climate change and depletion of abiotic resources) the salts recycled from fly ash had lower environmental impact than the conventional production processes, but for both toxicity categories potassium chloride and ammonium sulphate had higher environmental impact than the conventional production processes. The reason for this mainly depends on the chosen principle of allocation and the fact that the production of ammonium <b>sulphate</b> in the <b>Ash</b> 2 Salt process demands more inputs than the other salts in the process...|$|R
40|$|Pharmacognostical and {{preliminary}} phytochemical {{studies of}} Triphala churnam were carried out. The churnam of triphala consists of equal quantities of deseeded fruits of Terminalia chebula, Terminalia bellerica and Emblica officinalis. Triphala is exclusively used {{in more than}} 200 drug formulations in Indian system of Medicine. The present study involved the pharmacognostical evaluation of Triphala, in which morphological and powder microscopical characters were established. In addition, physico-chemical parameters such as ash values viz, total ash (10. 21 ± 0. 42), acid insoluble ash (2. 54 ± 0. 06), water-soluble ash (5. 46 ± 0. 24) and <b>sulphated</b> <b>ash</b> (13. 12 ± 0. 63), extractive values viz, alcohol soluble extractive (11. 20 ± 0. 18)) and water-soluble extractive (52. 56 ± 2. 04), fluorescent analysis and microchmical tests were determined. The preliminary phytochemical study revealed the presence of carbohydrates, reducing sugar and tannins in aqueous extract and carbohydrates, flavonoids and tannins in alcoholic extract.

40|$|Objective: The {{study was}} carried out to perform the pharmacognostic {{evaluation}} of Lantana camara Linn. root. Method: The pharmacognostic evaluation was done in terms of organoleptic, macro-microscopy, fluorescence analysis and physicochemical parameters. Results: The characteristic macroscopic features showed that the root consists of 25 - 40 cm long, 0. 2 - 4. 0 cm thick pieces which are usually branched, shallow, tough, creamish-brown externally, outer surface rough due to longitudinal wrinkles, with hard fracture, characteristic odour and pungent taste. The main microscopic characters of the root shows exfoliating cork, consisting of about 10 - 15 rows of tangentially elongated, thick-walled cells followed by cortex consisting of polygonal parenchymatous cells, a few containing rhomboidal shaped calcium oxalate crystals. Endodermis consists of 3 - 4 layers of non-lignified, thick-walled rounded parenchymatous cells followed by a single layer of non-lignified pericycle. Phloem, a wide zone of xylem consisting of lignified pitted vessels and bi-to triseriate medullary rays are also present.

40|$|Molasses {{produced}} by certain South African {{factories in the}} middle of the 1994 season had unduly low ratios of (fructose (F) plus glucose (G)) to <b>sulphated</b> <b>ash</b> (A). The current Target Purity formula indicated an abnormally close approach to equilibrium for these samples. The formula has the form Target Purity = a- b log «F + G) /A) The purity calculated using this formula has the characteristic of tending to infinity as the reducing sugar (F+ G) level approaches zero, which is unrealistic. A more appropriate formula of the form Target Purity = a- b (1 - exp(-c(F + G) /A)) was fitted to the body of exhaustibility test data that had been used to derive the current log formula. Applying the revised formula to the 1994 analyses gave a minimum Target Purity Difference (TDP) of 1, 5 units versus the 0, 5 unit for the log formula. This result is more in line with known levels of molasses purity rise across C-centrifugals. Replacement of the log formula by the exponential form is desirable to avoid an overly optimistic indication ofexhaustion performance when reducing sugar contents are exceptionally low...|$|E

40|$|The {{clarification}} of mixed juice {{has been the}} subject of research for decades, due mostly to its large impact on sugar quality. Much, if not all, of the work has however been done on mixed juice originating from milling rather than from diffusion. This paper examines a back-to-basics, laboratory approach, involving cane juices produced from conditions simulating milling and diffusion. Furthermore, different types of cane, for example fresh versus deteriorated, clean stalks versus stalks plus tops and trash, have been used. Saccharate and milk of lime have also been compared. Analytical techniques were carefully considered and methods such as X-ray fluorescence were used, and material balances across clarification were done. The laboratory work shows that, for the same cane quality, clear juice quality in terms of phosphate, calcium, magnesium, silica and <b>sulphated</b> <b>ash</b> is the same whether milling or diffusion has been used. Saccharate liming always yields better clear juice in terms of turbidity, colour, phosphate and calcium contents. Material balances closed well across clarification, except for phosphate and for silica; this highlights the need for sampling/analytical improvements for these two species. Finally, the effect of clarifier mud carryover on sugar quality is discussed...|$|E
