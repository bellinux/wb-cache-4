The study used two transgenic lines of potato, both with the GNA gene inserted. They were grown in the same conditions as the non-genetically modified parent plant. According to Pusztai, the potatoes were not <b>substantially</b> <b>equivalent,</b> {{as one of the}} transgenic lines contained 20 percent less protein than the other, and the starch and sugar contents varied by up to 20 percent among the three lines. Pusztai claimed that these differences were reason enough to discontinue further experimentation.|$|R

50|$|The FDA is {{responsible}} for the safety and security of human and animal food and drugs, including any that are genetically modified. The FDA was responsible for approving the first commercialized GMO, Genetech's genetically modified human insulin (Humulin) in 1982 and the first commercialized GM whole food, Calgene's Flavr Savr tomato in 1994. When evaluating new GM foods or feed the FDA looks for the presence of any new or altered allergens and toxicants and examines changes in the levels of nutritional and anti-nutritional substances. Food and feed that is identical or nearly identical in composition to current products is deemed to be <b>substantially</b> <b>equivalent</b> and is not required to undergo review by the FDA. The FDA has been criticized for using substantial equivalence, with a major accusation being that FDA review is essentially voluntary as almost all GM products are <b>substantially</b> <b>equivalent.</b> However, all GM food and feed currently on the US market (as of 2008) have undergone a FDA consultation, where the developer submits the compositional data and FDA scientist compare it to regular food and feed.|$|R
40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "As of January 7, 2013, the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) had finished initial, but not final, review steps for most of about 3, 800 submissions for new tobacco products (those not on the market on February 15, 2007). Ninety-nine percent of the submissions received by FDA were made under the substantial equivalence (SE) pathway. CTP determines whether the new tobacco product in an SE submission has the same characteristics as a predicate tobacco product (a product commercially marketed in the United States on February 15, 2007, or previously found by FDA to be <b>substantially</b> <b>equivalent)</b> or has different characteristics that do not raise different questions of public health. Initial review steps include CTP's determination of whether the new product is a type regulated by FDA and whether the submission is missing information. For most SE submissions, CTP {{took more than a}} year and a half from the date a submission was received to the date these initial steps were completed. Of the 3, 788 SE submissions, 3, 165 were received by FDA prior to a statutory deadline (March 22, 2011) allowing the product to be marketed unless CTP finds that they are not <b>substantially</b> <b>equivalent.</b> SE submissions received after that date cannot be marketed until CTP determines they are <b>substantially</b> <b>equivalent.</b> In late June 2013, CTP made a final decision on 6 of the 3, 788 SE submissions, finding that 2 of the products were <b>substantially</b> <b>equivalent</b> and that 4 were not; the remaining submissions were still undergoing CTP review. CTP officials and manufacturers told GAO that several factors (such as CTP requests for additional information from manufacturers for submissions and having to hire and train new staff) impacted the time it took CTP to review SE submissions. While CTP is working to address these factors by, for example, disseminating information to manufacturers to improve submission quality and developing training for staff, CTP does not have performance measures that include time frames for making final decisions on submissions by which to assess its progress. Without time frames, CTP is limited in its ability to evaluate policies, procedures, and staffing resources in relation to its review process and, in turn, is limited in its ability to reasonably assure efficiency and effectiveness. ...|$|R
