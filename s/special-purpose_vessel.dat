50|$|The Jacobstads Wapen is {{a modern}} replica of an 18th-century galeas built in Jakobstad, Finland, between 1988 and 1994. She is built {{according}} to blueprints by the Swedish warship architect Fredrik Henrik af Chapman dating from 1755, the oldest vessel blueprints found in Finland. She is classified by the Finnish national board of navigation as a passenger, <b>special-purpose</b> <b>vessel.</b> The 18th century galleon Jacobstads Wapen was sold off in Amsterdam.|$|E
50|$|Snodgrass pioneered several oceanographic techniques, {{including}} {{digital recording}} of wave pressure oscillation, the free-fall dropping of instruments {{to the sea}} floor for subsequent acoustic recall, {{and he was the}} first to design and use a portable seagoing laboratory. One of his most important contributions resulted from data collected during the early days of computers using the now antiquated system of IBM punch cards, and yet the data gathered on ocean swells was groundbreaking. It suggested that storms were being generated from very distant origins, as far as halfway around the earth. Snodgrass installed a directional array off San Clemente Island, just off the California coast. “The results were spectacular” said Walter Munk. Data pointed to storms originating close to Antarctica and New Zealand. Subsequently, six wave stations were established to confirm this theory. Stations were established in New Zealand, Samoa, Palmyra (an uninhabited island in the Pacific), Hawaii, FLIP (an SIO special <b>special-purpose</b> <b>vessel,</b> which was moored in position for about a month), and Alaska. Snodgrass' free-fall instruments were used in each station (except FLIP) to track waves originating in the southern storm belt.|$|E

50|$|During the 1960s, ZIM {{started to}} turn its focus to cargo ships, and {{obtained}} several <b>special-purpose</b> <b>vessels,</b> including refrigerated shipping, and oil tankers. ZIM transported crude oil from Iran to Israel, and oil byproducts from Israel to Europe.|$|R
40|$|This {{qualitative}} {{case study}} identifies and discusses {{the standards and}} risk management practices of the Ottawa Valley whitewater rafting industry and the impacts of the government enforced <b>Special-purpose</b> <b>Vessels</b> Regulations are discussed. Data collection occurred using a single case study design, which included interviews and document analysis. This study found that internal, industry, and actual standards are influenced {{through a variety of}} sources. These standards were found to affect the risk management practices of commercial whitewater rafting providers. In general, these standards promoted a high level of risk management within the Ottawa Valley rafting industry. The <b>Special-purpose</b> <b>Vessels</b> Regulations were found to be non-influential in raising the risk management standards of the Ottawa Valley whitewater rafting industry. ii Acknowledgements Grateful acknowledgement is due to the people who have helped me in the process of researching, writing, and revising the following pages.

50|$|Due to {{the strong}} Danish {{blockade}} outside Gothenburg, with an estimated manpower of 1,300 soldiers and several <b>special-purpose</b> <b>vessels</b> for bombarding coastal defense positions, the Danes were expected to attack either Marstrand or Älvsborg fortress. Captain Erik Sjöblad of the Gothenburg Squadron was ordered to moor all frigates and galleys to defend the harbor inlets. Rehnskiöld later gave the order to clear all ships at anchor, for sinking.|$|R
50|$|Modern {{commercial}} {{vessels are}} typically {{powered by a}} single propeller driven by a diesel or, less usually, gas turbine engine., but until the mid-19th century they were predominantly square sail rigged. The fastest vessels may use pump-jet engines. Most commercial vessels have full hull-forms to maximize cargo capacity. Hulls are usually made of steel, although aluminum {{can be used on}} faster craft, and fiberglass on the smallest service vessels. Commercial vessels generally have a crew headed by a captain, with deck officers and marine engineers on larger <b>vessels.</b> <b>Special-purpose</b> <b>vessels</b> often have specialized crew if necessary, for example scientists aboard research vessels.|$|R
2500|$|Due {{to various}} oversights by the government, BC Ferries, design bureaus, and the shipyards, {{the cost of}} the program more than doubled from $210 million ($70 million/vessel) to almost $460 million ($150 million/vessel) and final {{delivery}} was almost 3 years behind schedule. [...] As with all prototype construction this cost and build time was gradually being reduced with each successive completion. [...] A large part of the delay was because the shipyards commissioned to construct the vessels had very little experience working with aluminum. Also design changes during construction caused delays and more costs. [...] Previously, construction of aluminum vessels in British Columbia had been limited to fishing boats and <b>special-purpose</b> <b>vessels.</b> [...] The construction of three dual-hulled 122.5 m catamarans represented a very large leap of faith by the Government in British Columbia shipyards.|$|R
50|$|The Tsurugi-class is {{referred}} to as High-speed, <b>special-purpose</b> patrol <b>vessels</b> (Koutoku-sen). Planned as the top-tier of JCG intercept spy boats, this class features very high speed and accurate firepower. Its weaponry includes a JM61 20 mm Gatling gun, and a Remote Firing System consisting of a remote weapon system with a laser-optical fire-control system.|$|R
50|$|In 1972, Hughes was {{approached}} by the CIA to help secretly recover Soviet submarine K-129, which had sunk near Hawaii four years earlier. The recovery plan used the <b>special-purpose</b> salvage <b>vessel</b> Glomar Explorer. Hughes' involvement provided the CIA with a plausible cover story, {{having to do with}} civilian marine research at extreme depths and the mining of undersea manganese nodules. In the summer of 1974, Glomar Explorer attempted to raise the Soviet vessel.|$|R
50|$|Dr. Robert Kabelac - {{director}} of the BV from 1935 to 1960 - managed to avoid {{the dismantling of the}} BV after war as this happened to most other German shipyards. The company was allowed to resume shipbuilding already in 1949. Production could soon be continued, starting with repair of ships and locomotives and the construction of fishing vessels. Soon later the shipbuilding programme was enlarged and various types of ships were offered to the market as container/multi purpose cargo ships, passenger liners, passenger-cargo vessels, roll-on/roll-off ships, LNG and LPG tankers, supply ships, <b>special-purpose</b> ships, reefer <b>vessels</b> and others. End of the 1970th the BV became world leader in container delivered capacity and in innovative container ship design.|$|R
25|$|In 1972, {{during the}} cold war era, Hughes was {{approached}} by the CIA through his longtime partner, David Charnay, to help secretly recover the Soviet submarine K-129, which had sunk near Hawaii four years earlier. Hughes' involvement provided the CIA with a plausible cover story, conducting expensive civilian marine research at extreme depths and the mining of undersea manganese nodules. The recovery plan used the <b>special-purpose</b> salvage <b>vessel</b> Glomar Explorer. In the summer of 1974, Glomar Explorer attempted to raise the Soviet vessel. However, during the recovery a mechanical failure in the ship's grapple caused half of the submarine to break off and fall to the ocean floor. This section is believed to have held many of the most sought-after items, including its code book and nuclear missiles. Two nuclear-tipped torpedoes and some cryptographic machines were recovered, along with the bodies of six Soviet submariners who were subsequently given formal burial at sea in a filmed ceremony. The operation, known as Project Azorian (but incorrectly referred to by the press as Project Jennifer), became public in February 1975 after secret documents were released, obtained by burglars of Hughes' headquarters during a burglary in June 1974. Though he lent his name and his company's resources to the operation, Hughes and his companies had no operational involvement in the project. The Glomar Explorer was eventually acquired by Transocean Inc. (an offshore oil and gas drilling rig company) and was sent to the scrap yard in 2015 during a large decline in oil prices.|$|R
