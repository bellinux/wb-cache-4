5|$|Mallards {{are one of}} {{the most}} common {{varieties}} of ducks hunted as a sport. The ideal location for hunting mallards is considered to be where the water level is somewhat shallow. Hunting mallards might cause the population to decline in some places, at <b>some</b> <b>times,</b> and with some populations. In certain countries, the mallard may be legally shot but is protected under national acts and policies. For example, in the United Kingdom, the mallard is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which restricts certain hunting methods or taking or killing mallards.|$|E
5|$|A 2006 {{study by}} Milan Ćirković and colleagues {{extended}} {{the notion of}} a time-dependent galactic habitable zone, analyzing various catastrophic events as well as the underlying secular evolution of galactic dynamics. The paper considers that the number of habitable planets may fluctuate wildly with time due to the unpredictable timing of catastrophic events, thereby creating a punctuated equilibrium in which habitable planets are more likely at <b>some</b> <b>times</b> than at others. Based on the results of Monte Carlo simulations on a toy model of the Milky Way, the team found that the number of habitable planets is likely to increase with time, though not in a perfectly linear pattern.|$|E

5|$|Banksia prionotes {{was first}} {{described}} in 1840 by English botanist John Lindley, probably from material collected by James Drummond the previous year. There are no recognised varieties, {{although it has}} been known to hybridise with Banksia hookeriana. Widely distributed in south-west Western Australia, B.prionotes is found from Shark Bay (25° S) in the north, south as far as Kojonup (33°50′S). It grows exclusively in sandy soils, and is usually the dominant plant in scrubland or low woodland. Pollinated by birds, it provides food for a wide array of vertebrate and invertebrate animals in the autumn and winter months. It is an important source of food for honeyeaters (Meliphagidae), and is critical to their survival in the Avon Wheatbelt region, where it is the only nectar-producing plant in flower at <b>some</b> <b>times</b> of the year.|$|E
5|$|The animal can be host to {{a number}} of {{different}} parasites. In one study, blue wildebeest were found to be hosts to thirteen species of nematode, one trematode, larvae of five oestrid flies, three species of lice, seven ixodid tick species, one mite and the larvae of a tongue worm. Of these, most were more prevalent at <b>some</b> <b>times</b> of the year than others. Generally, the larvae of Gedoelstica and Oestrus occur in the nasal passages and respiratory cavities of the blue wildebeest, and sometimes migrate to the brain. Compared to some other bovids, blue wildebeest are resistant to infestations by several species of tick.|$|E
