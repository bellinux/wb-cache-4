5|$|Bobby Lashley and Team McMahon {{continued}} their rivalry, as Mr. McMahon {{was forced to}} book himself against Lashley at One Night <b>Stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Street Fight for the ECW World Championship. Lashley {{won the right to}} face McMahon by winning a Gauntlet match with the stipulation that he would receive a title shot if he beat Chris Masters, Viscera, Umaga and Shane McMahon in succession. At One Night Stand, Lashley defeated Mr. McMahon in a Street Fight to win the ECW World Championship despite interference by Shane McMahon and Umaga.|$|E
5|$|On April 2, The World's Greatest Tag Team was {{unsuccessful}} in defeating {{the team of}} Ric Flair and Carlito, but defeated them in a rematch on April 16 when Haas distracted Carlito, allowing Benjamin to gain the win. They won again two weeks later when Carlito turned on Flair, attacking him and allowing The World's Greatest Tag Team to win via countout. They then challenged the Hardy Boyz for the World Tag Team Championship at One Night <b>Stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> ladder match, but were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|At WrestleMania XXIV, Edge {{lost the}} World Heavyweight {{championship}} to the Undertaker when he tapped {{out to the}} Hell's Gate. In a WrestleMania rematch, The Undertaker defeated Edge once again at Backlash to retain the World Heavyweight championship. Following Backlash, The Undertaker was stripped of the World title by Vickie Guerrero and faced Edge for the title at Judgment Day in May and then again at One Night <b>Stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> TLC match in June. The first match ended with a countout victory for The Undertaker but no champion was crowned due to the circumstances. The second match at One Night Stand saw Edge walk away champion, which also meant Undertaker {{was forced to leave}} the company.|$|E

5|$|The {{highlight}} of his school career came in April 2008, when he scored 227 not out during a record-breaking opening <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 50-over national schools game, adding 340 with Alex Barrow. He captained King's during the 2008 season, and improved on his batting totals {{from the previous}} two years, scoring 851 runs, over 250 {{more than any other}} member of the team. His batting average of 94.55 was the sixth highest amongst all school's batsmen reported in Wisden, while his high-score of 227* was the highest score they recorded. During that 2008 season, Buttler also played for Somerset Second XI. With captain Carl Gazzard keeping wicket in the majority of these matches, Buttler played purely as a batsman, although in his final match of the season for the team, he kept wicket and took six catches in the first-innings against Worcestershire Second XI. In the previous match, against Hampshire Second XI, Buttler had made 140 batting from number four.|$|E
5|$|Angela (Angela Kinsey) and Robert Lipton (Jack Coleman) {{are celebrating}} their son Phillip's first {{birthday}} with {{a gathering of}} wealthy political allies. Angela is shocked to learn that Robert invited his lover Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) to the party after she told Robert {{she did not want}} him there. Angela invites Dwight (her own extramarital lover) in retaliation, but he scorns the invitation. Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) hears of this and eagerly volunteers to go in Dwight's place. Oscar, who believes he was invited because Robert is in love with him, is hurt when he finds out that he was invited to boost Robert's opinion in the polls among Latino voters. During the taking of a group photo, Robert has Oscar <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> spot where he almost completely blocks off Angela, and Oscar and Angela begin to bicker with each other. After the party, Robert rebukes them for their behavior and admonishes them to do better in the future. However, Kevin interrupts to tell Robert that he is a terrible person for treating Angela and Oscar strictly as a means to gain political support.|$|E
5|$|Cena made a {{surprise}} return {{as the final}} participant of the Royal Rumble match, winning the match, and the traditional WrestleMania title shot, by last eliminating Triple H. Instead of waiting until WrestleMania, the title shot was cashed in against then WWE Champion Randy Orton at February's No Way Out pay-per-view in a match where Cena won by disqualification, resulting in him not getting the championship. The night after No Way Out, Cena was placed back into WrestleMania XXIV's WWE Championship match, making it a triple threat match also involving Triple H, during which he was pinned by Orton. At Backlash, Cena failed to regain the title in a fatal four-way elimination match, {{in which he was}} pinned by Orton. Triple H won the title during that match, during which Cena eliminated JBL, renewing their feud from 2005. Cena defeated JBL at Judgment Day and then at One Night <b>Stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> First Blood match. JBL, however, defeated him in a New York City Parking Lot Brawl at The Great American Bash in July. Cena also failed to regain the WWE Championship from Triple H at Night of Champions.|$|E

5|$|Feethams was {{originally}} used by Darlington Cricket Club, but {{began to be}} used for football in the 1860s. Darlington F.C. began playing there when they formed in 1883. With growing crowd figures, the ground was expanded with the construction of the West stand {{at the turn of the}} century and the Polam Lane end in 1905. In 1913, a pair of towers were built at the entrance to the ground, and in 1920, offices and changing rooms were built underneath the East stand. Floodlights were installed in September 1960, but after their first use an electrical fault gutted the West <b>stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> fire, prompting its rebuilding. In 1997, the East stand was demolished and rebuilt as an all-seater stand, but its cost had a major negative effect on the club's finances. George Reynolds came in to the club, paid its debts and initiated construction of a new stadium. The last match played at Feethams was a 2–2 draw with Leyton Orient on 3 May 2003. Following the closure of the ground, the floodlights were sold to Workington A.F.C. and the stadium demolished. A housing estate was planned for the cleared site.|$|E
5|$|The other primary feud {{featured}} on the One Night Stand card consisted of both Raw and ECW superstars. ECW's Bobby Lashley battled Raw's Vince McMahon for the ECW World Championship. Lashley faced Team McMahon (ECW World Champion Vince McMahon, Shane, and Umaga) in a 3-on-1 tag team Handicap match at Judgment Day, with the ECW World Championship on the line. Lashley won the match, pinning Shane after a Dominator powerslam. After the match, however, Vince declared that Lashley had not won the title {{and that he was}} still the ECW World Champion, as he had not been pinned. In the match, Lashley could have won the title, but not a member of Team McMahon. The following night, on the May 21 edition of Raw, Lashley was put into a Gauntlet match by Vince McMahon, with the stipulation that if he won all four of the matches in the gauntlet, he would face Vince at One Night Stand. Lashley won all four matches, defeating Chris Masters, Viscera, Umaga and Shane McMahon in succession. As a result, Lashley gained a title shot at One Night <b>Stand</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Street Fight. On the May 28 edition of Raw, Lashley teamed with WWE Champion John Cena to take on Umaga, Shane McMahon and The Great Khali in a Handicap match. Shane won the match, pinning Lashley after an elbow drop. Vince was scheduled to face Lashley in an arm wrestling contest on the June 2 edition of Saturday Night's Main Event. Moments before the contest began, however, Vince booked Mark Henry as Lashley's opponent instead. During the contest, Vince attacked Lashley, hitting him with a steel chair.|$|E
