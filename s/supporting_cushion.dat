40|$|A linearized {{theory of}} {{hovercraft}} response while moving over regular waves {{is modified to}} account for, firstly, a cushion planform other than rectangular and, secondly, deflections of the skirt enclosing the <b>supporting</b> <b>cushion</b> {{as a result of}} wave-induced variations in the internal pressures. Consideration is given to the pitching and heaving of a hovercraft whose plenum air chamber is divided into two compartments by a transverse barrier. Detailed calculations are carried out for a cushion planform whose forward part is hexagonal and for a vertically deflecting skirt hemline, but the results are more widely useful in suggesting the general nature of the roles of cushion planform and skirt dynamics. A method of representing the overall effect of skirt deflection is proposed, involving four dimensionless coefficients, and the effect of these coefficients on the dynamic characteristics is investigated. ...|$|E
40|$|Pressure {{distributions}} at {{the interface}} between skin and supporting tissues are used in design of supporting surfaces like beds, wheel chairs, prostheses and in sales brochures to support commercial products. The reasoning behind this is, that equal pressure distributions {{in the absence of}} high pressure gradients is assumed to minimise the risk of developing pressure sores. Notwithstanding the difficulty in performing reproducible and accurate pressure measurements, the question arises if the interface pressure distribution is representative of the internal mechanical state of the soft tissues involved. The paper describes a study of the mechanical condition of a supported buttock contact, depending on cushion properties, relative properties of tissue layers and friction. Numerical, mechanical simulations of a buttock on a <b>supporting</b> <b>cushion</b> are described. The ischial tuberosity is modelled as a rigid body, whereas the overlying muscle, fat and skin layers are modelled as a non-linear Ogden material. Material parameters and thickness of the fat layer are varied. Coulomb friction between buttock and cushion is modelled with different values of the friction coefficient. Moreover, the thickness and properties of the cushion are varied. High shear strains are found in the muscle near the bony prominence and the fat layer near the symmetry line. The performed parameter variations lead to large differences in shear strain in the fat layer but relatively small variations in the skeletal muscle. Even with a soft cushion, leading to a high reduction of the interface pressure the deformation of the skeletal muscle near the bone is high enough to form a risk, which is a clear argument that interface pressures alone are not sufficient to evaluate supporting surfaces...|$|E

40|$|Advanced {{substrate}} design, efficient washcoat/catalyst formulation {{and robust}} packaging are critical elements to assure performance and durability of catalytic converters and diesel particulate filters. Radial seals, axial seals and L-seals made of knitted wiremesh are used with conventional mounting systems to provide compressible and durable <b>support</b> <b>cushions</b> for catalyst and filter substrates. Axial and radial mounting {{forces of the}} seals are optimized by material type, seal density, wiremesh strand, wiremesh surface profile (flat or round), wiremesh surface characteristics, wiremesh temper, thermal impacts, and wiremesh geometry. Compression characteristics of stainless steel alloy A 286 tremendously increase (> 20 %) during heat treatment as precipitation and hardening occurs. Compression force tends to stabilize during cycling, retaining a residual force. Radial seals provide radial mounting pressure and mat erosion protection. V-seal is an exhaust gas blocking seal used with stainless steel knitted wiremesh support to prevent exhaust gas from bypassing the ceramic monolith in catalytic converter. L-seals provide combination of axial and radial mounting force for the converter whereas axial seals are designed to provide only axial supports.

40|$|Deep {{tissue injury}} (DTI) is a severe type of {{pressure}} ulcer, in which damage initiates under intact skin, in soft tissues that are mechanically deformed by load-bearing bony prominences. Sitting-acquired DTI typically {{occurs in the}} gluteus muscles that could sustain deformations by the weight-bearing ischial tuberosities (ITs). No clinical method currently exists for measuring internal tissue deformations; so design and selection of wheelchair cushions are based mostly on meas-uring sitting pressures. Our objective was to evaluate the influence of different commercial cushions on internal soft-tissue deformations under the ITs, using weight-bearing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We specifically compared muscle, superficial fat, and effective (muscle and fat together) tissue deformations while subjects (n = 10) sat on four cushions (two viscoelastic and two foam) and directly on a rigid support. Deformations were maximal in muscle tissue (mean ~ 70 %), twice more the amount than in fat (~ 30 %). Effective soft-tissue deformations were ~ 50 % to ~ 60 %. Although cushions mildly reduced muscle deformations {{in the order of}} 10 %, theoretically, our interpretation suggests that this deformation level adds safe sitting time. This study demonstrated that weight-bearing MRI is applicable for evaluating wheelchair cushions and, in the future, may be a tool to systematically <b>support</b> <b>cushion</b> design and selection...|$|R

5000|$|Barefoot Running Shoes are {{characterized}} by their zero drop from heel to toe, no arch <b>support,</b> minimal <b>cushioning</b> at the heel, and a very thin sole of around 3-10mm. Also, the toe box is considerably wider to provide more space to the toes, whereby they slightly resemble the shape of ducks feet, when viewed from above and compared to traditional shoes. Few product lines fall into this category. Examples include the Vibram FiveFingers and Merrell Glove, which use an outsole produced by Vibram. The Xero Prio are another example.|$|R
5000|$|So called 'traditional' {{running shoes}} are {{designed}} to give more <b>support</b> and <b>cushion</b> the landing to reduce the effects of impact. They allow for more comfortable running on hard surfaces such as asphalt and also protect the foot when stepping on rocks or other potentially sharp objects. However, the cushioning provided in traditional running shoes is thought to encourage a foot strike pattern, where the heel lands first. Heel striking generates a relatively large amount of impact force that can put {{different parts of the}} lower extremities under excessive stress.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe City Automated Transport System (CATS) was a {{collaborative}} FP 7 European project that lasted from 2010 to 2014. Its {{objective was to}} evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of driverless electric vehicles in European cities. This contribution explains how the project was implemented by 11 teams in five countries, culminating with practical trials of driverless vehicles in Strasbourg, France; Ploiesti, Romania; and Lausanne, Switzerland. The Navya vehicles used were able to transport up to eight passengers, in an open vehicle where passengers could recline against lumbar <b>support</b> <b>cushions.</b> After extensive road testing in Strasbourg, the final demonstration {{took place at the}} EPFL campus in Lausanne, where around 1600 people were transported safely during 16 days of vehicle operation. Three vehicles were used, a fourth remaining on campus as a backup. Although no driver was present, a student was available on board of each vehicle to respond to questions from the passengers and to handle the three points on the 1. 8 km route where there was insufficient leeway for two vehicles to pass each other. Passenger reactions to the driverless vehicle concept were collected by questionnaire and were overwhelmingly positive. Caveats include limited access for people with disabilities and the risk that a regular service based on this new concept might compete with walking and cycling rather than with transport by car. Implications for the acceptability of driverless electric vehicles in Europe and elsewhere are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Because of {{the lack}} of <b>support</b> and <b>cushioning</b> in racing flats, they are {{typically}} not recommended for use by beginner runners or those who are not competing because of their lack of lower leg/foot strength. Studies show the locations of the load and pressure on different areas of the foot when using training shoes versus racing flats. The style of the shoes can alter the stress on the runner's foot and one should consider this when determining the best shoes for their personal level of skill. As an athlete progresses with their training, {{they will be able to}} use racing flats more safely and effectively.|$|R

30|$|When an {{output curve}} {{force is applied}} to a {{horizontal}} servo cylinder with a heavy load, the piston rod bears a dynamic partial load based on the installation and load characteristics, which significantly affects the frequency response and control accuracy of the servo cylinder. Based on this partial load, increased friction can lead to cylinder bore scuffing, leakage, lack of output power, or even system failure. In this paper, a novel asymmetric static-pressure support structure is proposed based on the principle of hydrostatic support. The radial component force of a dynamic partial load is balanced by cooperation between the <b>support</b> oil <b>cushion</b> of the variable hydraulic pressure <b>support</b> structure, oil <b>cushion</b> of the supportive force, and the damper. Adaptive control of the servo cylinder piston rod, guide sleeve, and piston, as well as the cylinder oil film friction between lubricated surfaces is achieved. In this paper, theoretical design and analysis of the traditional hydrostatic bearing structure and novel structure are presented. A hydraulic dynamic shear scissor is used as a research target to derive a structural dynamic model. Comparative simulations are performed using Matlab Simulink. Additionally, flow field analysis of the novel structure is performed, which verifies the rationality and feasibility of the proposed structure and system.|$|R

40|$|To prevent {{low back}} pain and sitting {{discomfort}} in prolonged sitting, inflatable lumbar <b>support</b> <b>cushion,</b> in which, air is supplied with a linear compressor and pressure is controlled with a E/P regulator, has been developed to provide lumbar lordotic continuous passive motion(CPM). Currently, we developed dual CPM device, in which additional CPM cushion was located in the anterior portion of the seat. Effects of these devices in prolonged sitting were determined. A total of 23 male volunteers without {{low back pain}} was recruited. The dual CPM has synchronized two bladders with reciprocal motion in the opposite phase: When one bladder inflates the other deflates. Subjects {{sat in a chair}} for a two-h period on each of four consecutive days under four randomized test modalities: 1, no lumbar support; 2, static lumbar support; 3, lumbar support CPM; and 4,dual CPM. The CPM cycle rate was set at 60 seconds inflation and 60 seconds deflation. Each subject selected an optimal maximum bladder pressure through trial and error. Finally, each subject indicated lumbar discomfort, stiffness, fatigue, and buttock numbness on 10 -cm visual analog scales(VAS). The mean VAS scores from the 4 periods were compared with paired T tests. It was 8. 2 ± 1. 6 without lumbar support, 5. 9 ± 1. 9 with the fixed support, and 5. 7 ± 2. 3 with lumbar support CPM. There was no statistical significant difference between the fixed support and lumbar support CPM. Compared to the lumbar support CPM, significant improvement was obtained with the dual CPM device(p< 0. 05). The benefits of lumbar support CPM over static lumbar support are limited. The effect of dual CPM can be explained by anterior rotation of the pelvis. The dual CPM may provide a comprehensive solution for occupational disability due to sitting intolerance...|$|R
