50|$|Patty pan squash {{comes in}} yellow, green, and white varieties.

50|$|Chinese rice vinegars are {{stronger}} than Japanese ones, and range in colour from clear to various shades of red, brown and black and are therefore known as rice wine vinergar. Chinese and especially Japanese vinegars are less acidic than the distilled Western vinegars which, for that reason, are not appropriate substitutes for rice vinegars. The majority of the Asian rice vinegar types are also more mild and <b>sweet</b> than <b>vinegars</b> typically used in the Western world, with black vinegars as a notable exception. Chinese rice vinegars are made from huangjiu, a type of rice wine.|$|R

'Tis not {{improbable}} also, {{but that}} our taste {{may be very}} much improv'd either by preparing our taste for the Body, as, after eating bitter things, Wine, or other Vinous liquors, are more sensibly tasted; or else by preparing Bodies for our tast; as the dissolving of Metals with acid Liquors, make them tastable, which were before altogether insipid; thus Lead becomes sweeter then Sugar, and Silver more bitter then Gall, Copper and Iron of most loathsome tasts.

5000|$|Agrodolce [...] is a {{traditional}} sweet and sour sauce in Italian cuisine. Its name comes from [...] "agro" [...] (sour) and [...] "dolce" [...] (sweet).

40|$|Test {{was carried}} out to {{ascertain}} the influence of several seasonings mixed in fish muscle on the formation of histamine and ammonia in it during storage. For the formation of ammonia, sodium chloride was inhibitory, soy a little acceleratory and others (<b>sweet</b> wine, <b>vinegar,</b> spirits and sugars) not influential. On the other hand, {{for the formation of}} histamine, sodium chloride was inhibitory, cane sugar and glucose not influential or inhibitory while pH value o muscle added with sugar changed to acid side, and others were not influential. Therefore, it was considered that the influence of seasonings on the production of histamine in the processed fish products was almost not appreciable, and was far from being accelerating, while in accordance with adding conditions they showed somewhat inhibitory tendencies. ...|$|R
50|$|An {{offshoot}} {{that took}} root in Anglo-Indian cuisine {{is usually a}} tart fruit such as sharp apples, rhubarb or damson pickle made milder by an equal weight of sugar (usually demerara or brown sugar to replace jaggery in some Indian <b>sweet</b> chutneys). <b>Vinegar</b> {{was added to the}} recipe for English-style chutney that traditionally aims to give a long shelf life so that autumn fruit can be preserved for use throughout the year (as are jams, jellies and pickles) or else to be sold as a commercial product. Indian pickles use mustard oil as a pickling agent, but Anglo-Indian style chutney uses malt or cider vinegar which produces a milder product that in western cuisine is usually eaten with a Cheddar-type cheese or with cold meats and fowl, typically in cold pub lunches.|$|R

40|$|A lot of <b>sweet</b> {{and sour}} <b>vinegars</b> and dressing, derived {{from grape must}} and appealed as “balsamic”, are {{currently}} available in the market all over the world. We have grouped the different products {{on the basis of}} their Protected Geographical Status, ingredients and additives used, as well as the production technology. The consumer perception of the attribute “balsamic” isassociated with a series of common features that clearly discriminates them from other types of vinegars. They are dark, opalescent, shiny, thick and viscous, and the acidic taste is modulated by a variable amount of sugars. The features described are usually achieved in different ways and this make the difference among the balsamic vinegarsand sauces. The key point refers to the fact that different methods, used for the same purpose, can have dramaticallydifferent costs, which then affect the price and quality of the finished product; i. e. the dark colour can be obtained with addition of caramel (E 150 d) or by long aging. The differences on production cost is huge and obvious. The most expensive step in industrial production is aging, and of course this is particularly important for traditional balsamic vinegars. Aging plays a key role in determining many valuable characteristics of balsamic, for example, the dark brown colour belongs from the initial process of must cooking, which triggers a series of non-enzymatic browning reactions that slowly continue over the years. The process of aging in wood barrels increases the specific gravityand viscosity due to the progressive loss of water and theformation of high molecular weight compounds (melanoidins) that modify the rheological properties of the product...|$|R
