5|$|George A. Campbell and Zobel {{worked on}} this problem of extracting a <b>single</b> <b>sideband</b> from an amplitude-modulated {{composite}} wave for use in multiplexing telephone channels and the related problem of extracting (de-multiplexing) the signal {{at the far end}} of the transmission.|$|E
5|$|After {{the work}} of John R. Carson in 1915 {{it became clear that}} {{multiplexed}} telephone transmissions could be greatly improved by the use of <b>single</b> <b>sideband</b> suppressed carrier (SSB) transmission. Compared to basic amplitude modulation (AM) SSB has the advantage of half the bandwidth and a fraction of the power (one sideband can have no more than 1/6 of the total power and would typically be a lot less). AM analysed in the frequency domain consists of a carrier and two sidebands. The carrier wave in AM represents the majority of the transmitted power but contains no information whatsoever. The two sidebands both contain identical information so only one is required, at least from an information transmission point of view. Up to this point filtering had been by simple tuned circuits. However, SSB required a flat response over the sideband of interest and maximum rejection of the other sideband with a very sharp transition between the two. As the idea was to put another (completely different) signal in the slot vacated by the unwanted sideband it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent crosstalk. At the same time minimum distortion (i.e. flat response) is obviously desirable for the sideband being retained. This requirement led to a big research effort in the design of electric wave filters.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a hybrid laser-microwave scheme to implement two-qubit geometric phase gates in crystals of trapped ions. The proposed gates can attain errors below the fault-tolerance threshold {{in the presence}} of thermal, dephasing, laser-phase, and microwave-intensity noise. Moreover, our proposal is technically less demanding than previous schemes, since it does not require a laser arrangement with interferometric stability. The laser beams are tuned close to a <b>single</b> vibrational <b>sideband</b> to entangle the qubits, while strong microwave drivings provide the geometric character to the gate, and thus protect the qubits from these different sources of noise. A thorough analytic and numerical study of the performance of these gates in realistic noisy regimes is presented. Comment: closer to published versio...|$|R
25|$|Amateur radio {{operators}} use various {{modes of}} transmission to communicate. The two most common modes for voice transmissions are frequency modulation (FM) and <b>single</b> <b>sideband</b> (SSB). FM offers high quality audio signals, while SSB is better at long distance communication when bandwidth is restricted.|$|E
25|$|When {{so-called}} high-side injection {{has been}} used, where the local oscillator is {{at a higher}} frequency than the received signal (as is common), then the frequency spectrum of the original signal will be reversed. This {{must be taken into}} account by the demodulator (and in the IF filtering) in the case of certain types of modulation such as <b>single</b> <b>sideband.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{received}} {{signal is}} now processed by the demodulator stage where the audio signal (or other baseband signal) is recovered and then further amplified. AM demodulation requires the simple rectification of the RF signal (so-called envelope detection), {{and a simple}} RC low pass filter to remove remnants of the intermediate frequency. FM signals may be detected using a discriminator, ratio detector, or phase-locked loop. Continuous wave (Morse code) and <b>single</b> <b>sideband</b> signals require a product detector using a so-called beat frequency oscillator, {{and there are other}} techniques used for different types of modulation. The resulting audio signal (for instance) is then amplified and drives a loudspeaker.|$|E

40|$|We present ultrasensitive {{measurements}} of molecular absorption using frequency-agile rapid scanning, cavity ring-down spectroscopy with an external-cavity diode laser. A microwave source that drives an electro-optic phase modulator with a bandwidth of 20 GHz generates pairs of sidebands on the probe laser.

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} how an acoustic phonon bath when coupled to a quantum dot {{with the help}} of a bichromatic laser field may effectively form a quantum squeezed reservoir. This approach allows to achieve an arbitrary degree of squeezing of the effective reservoir and it incorporates the properties of the reservoir into two parameters, which can be controlled by varying the ratio of the Rabi frequencies of the bichromatic field. It is found that for unequal Rabi frequencies, the effective reservoir may appear as a quantum squeezed field of ordinary or inverted harmonic oscillators. When the Rabi frequencies are equal the effective reservoir appears as a perfectly squeezed field in which the decay of one of the polarization quadratures of the quantum dot dipole moment is inhibited. The decay of the quantum dot to a stationary state which depends on the initial coherence is predicted. This unusual result is shown to be a consequence of a quantum-nondemolition type coupling of the quantum dot to the engineered squeezed reservoir. The effect of the initial coherence on the steady-state dressed-state population distribution and the fluorescence spectrum is discussed in details. The complete polarization of the dressed state population and asymmetric spectra composed of only a <b>single</b> Rabi <b>sideband</b> peak are obtained under strictly resonant excitation.

2500|$|One {{method of}} {{producing}} an SSB signal {{is to remove}} one of the sidebands via filtering, leaving only either the upper sideband (USB), the sideband with the higher frequency, or less commonly the lower sideband (LSB), the sideband with the lower frequency. Most often, the carrier is reduced or removed entirely (suppressed), being referred to in full as <b>single</b> <b>sideband</b> suppressed carrier (SSBSC). Assuming both sidebands are symmetric, which {{is the case for}} a normal AM signal, no information is lost in the process. [...] Since the final RF amplification is now concentrated in a <b>single</b> <b>sideband,</b> the effective power output is greater than in normal AM (the carrier and redundant sideband account for well over half of the power output of an AM transmitter). Though SSB uses substantially less bandwidth and power, it cannot be demodulated by a simple envelope detector like standard AM.|$|E

2500|$|To {{recover the}} {{original}} {{signal from the}} IF SSB signal, the <b>single</b> <b>sideband</b> must be frequency-shifted down to its original range of baseband frequencies, by using a product detector which mixes it with the output of a beat frequency oscillator (BFO).

40|$|We {{report a}} {{detailed}} investigation on near-ground state cooling {{of one and}} two trapped atomic ions.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a detailed numerical analysis, fabrication method and experimental investigation on 45 º tilted fiber gratings (45 º-TFGs) and excessively tilted fiber gratings (Ex-TFGs), and their applications in fiber laser and sensing systems. The {{one of the}} most significant contributions of the work reported in this thesis is that the 45 º-TFGs with high polarization extinction ratio (PER) have been fabricated in single mode telecom and polarization maintaining (PM) fibers with spectral response covering three prominent optic communication and central wavelength ranges at 1060 nm, 1310 nm and 1550 nm. The most achieved PERs for the 45 º-TFGs are up to and greater than 35 - 50 dB, which have reached and even exceeded many commercial in-fiber polarizers. It has been proposed that the 45 º-TFGs of high PER can be used as ideal in-fiber polarizers for a wide range of fiber systems and applications. In addition, in-depth detailed theoretical models and analysis have been developed and systematic experimental evaluation has been conducted producing results in excellent agreement with theoretical modeling. Another important outcome of the research work is the proposal and demonstration of all fiber Lyot filters (AFLFs) implemented by utilizing two (for a single stage type) and more (for multi-stage) 45 º-TFGs in PM fiber cavity structure. The detailed theoretical analysis and modelling of such AFLFs have also been carried out giving design guidance for the practical implementation. The unique function advantages of 45 º-TFG based AFLFs have been revealed, showing high finesse multi-wavelength transmission of single polarization and wide range of tuneability. The temperature tuning results of AFLFs have shown that the AFLFs have 60 times higher thermal sensitivity than the normal FBGs, thus permitting thermal tuning rate of ~ 8 nm/ 10 ºC. By using an intra-cavity AFLF, an all fiber soliton mode locking laser with almost total suppression of siliton <b>sidebands,</b> <b>single</b> polarization output and single/multi-wavelength switchable operation has been demonstrated. The final significant contribution is the theoretical analysis and experimental verification on the design, fabrication and sensing application of Ex-TFGs. The Ex-TFG sensitivity model to the surrounding medium refractive index (SRI) has been developed for the first time, and the factors that affect the thermal and SRI sensitivity in relation to the wavelength range, tilt angle, and the size of cladding have been investigated. As a practical SRI sensor, an 81 º-TFG UV-inscribed in the fiber with small (40 μm) cladding radius has shown an SRI sensitivity up to 1180 nm/RIU in the index of 1. 345 range. Finally, to ensure single polarization detection in such an SRI sensor, a hybrid configuration by UV-inscribing a 45 º-TFG and an 81 º-TFG closely on the same piece of fiber has been demonstrated as a more advanced SRI sensing system...|$|R

2500|$|Aircraft {{communications}} {{radio operations}} worldwide use amplitude modulation, predominantly A3E double sideband with full carrier on VHF and UHF, and J3E <b>single</b> <b>sideband</b> with suppressed carrier on HF. Besides being simple, power-efficient and compatible with legacy equipment, AM and SSB permit stronger stations to override weaker or interfering stations. Additionally, this method does not {{suffer from the}} capture effect found in FM. Even if a pilot is transmitting, a control tower can [...] "talk over" [...] that transmission and other aircraft will hear a somewhat garbled mixture of both transmissions, rather than just one or the other. Even if both transmissions are received with identical signal strength, a heterodyne will be heard where no such indication of blockage would be evident in an FM system.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{disadvantage}} of AM {{is that it}} is inefficient in power usage; at least two-thirds of the power is concentrated in the carrier signal. [...] The carrier signal contains none of the original information being transmitted (voice, video, data, etc.). [...] However its presence provides a simple means of demodulation using envelope detection, providing a frequency and phase reference to extract the modulation from the sidebands. [...] In some modulation systems based on AM, a lower transmitter power is required through partial or total elimination of the carrier component, however receivers for these signals are more complex and costly. The receiver may regenerate a copy of the carrier frequency (usually as shifted to the intermediate frequency) from a greatly reduced [...] "pilot" [...] carrier (in reduced-carrier transmission or DSB-RC) to use in the demodulation process. Even with the carrier totally eliminated in double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission, carrier regeneration is possible using a Costas phase-locked loop. This doesn't work however for single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission (SSB-SC), leading to the characteristic [...] "Donald Duck" [...] sound from such receivers when slightly detuned. <b>Single</b> <b>sideband</b> is nevertheless used widely in amateur radio and other voice communications both due to its power efficiency and bandwidth efficiency (cutting the RF bandwidth in half compared to standard AM). On the other hand, in medium wave and short wave broadcasting, standard AM with the full carrier allows for reception using inexpensive receivers. The broadcaster absorbs the extra power cost to greatly increase potential audience.|$|E
40|$|The ranging {{signals of}} coming Galileo will {{make use of}} chip rates and lengths of {{pseudorandom}} noise (PRN) codes which are significantly higher as utilised by the current signals of GPS. While offering very good overall system performance, the use of long ranging codes makes fast and reliable signal acquisition a challenging task. This {{stems from the fact}} that acquisition is essentially a two-dimensional search process over the uncertainty region spanned by the PRN code-phase and residual Doppler of a satellite signal to be acquired. Normally, if no assistance information is available, the code-phase uncertainty is equal to the entire PRN code length. With Galileo signals having the PRN code length up to 10230 chip, the resulted acquisition search space is up to 10 times larger than in case of GPS C/A code. In order to cope with the increasing search space, the acquisition techniques must be carefully designed taking into account new features of the Galileo signals such as the presence of pilot channels and binary offset carrier (BOC) modulation. This paper will address the problem of optimum GNSS signal acquisition by introducing a general theoretical approach for the acquisition performance analysis. In this paper we adopt a general structure of the acquisition process consisting of three stages: detection, verification and fine acquisition. Considering these three stages in one structure enables the performance analysis of the complete acquisition process, from very coarse to the fine acquisition. Various acquisition schemes can be formed by applying either serial or parallel or hybrid search strategies at the detection stage. The proposed structure is quite flexible and includes many practical acquisition schemes like double-dwell serial search or all-in-parallel (maximum likelihood) FFT-based acquisition as particular cases. The mathematical model of the acquisition process with the proposed structure will be described. The model utilizes the Markov chains theory and the flow graph technique to obtain analytical results for the main acquisition performance parameters such as the mean acquisition time (MAT), the mean acquisition complexity (MAC), overall probabilities of detection, false alarm and some others. The introduction of the MAC as a performance metric is justified by the fact that it is independent of the search strategy. This metric is derived in a way similar to the MAT, a widely used performance parameter, by associating complexity figures with the decision algorithms used at each acquisition stage. The mean acquisition complexity might be of special interest in software receiver applications with flexible management of computational resources. Also, the specific of Galileo signals will be addressed. The effect of Galileo signal features like pilot channels and BOC modulation on acquisition process design and performance will be discussed. In the case of BOC signals, options used with <b>single</b> and double <b>sideband</b> acquisition will be considered. We will present some simulation results for acquisition performance with different acquisition schemes. The analytical models of decision algorithms used for simulations, e. g. single-dwell, M of N, maximum likelihood, bump-jumping, will be shortly described.
