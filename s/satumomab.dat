50|$|Indium (111In) <b>satumomab</b> {{pendetide}} (trade name OncoScint CR103) is a mouse {{monoclonal antibody}} {{which is used}} for cancer diagnosis. The antibody itself, <b>satumomab,</b> is linked to pendetide, a derivative of DTPA. Pendetide acts as a chelating agent for the radionuclide indium-111.|$|E
50|$|In {{capromab}} pendetide and <b>satumomab</b> pendetide, the chelator pendetide (GYK-DTPA) is {{a modified}} DTPA containing a peptide linker used {{to connect the}} chelate to an antibody.|$|E
50|$|TAG-72 is a {{tumor marker}} {{and can be}} {{measured}} with radioimmunoassays like CA 72-4, which uses the monoclonal antibodies indium (111In) <b>satumomab</b> pendetide and iodine (125I) minretumomab. This assay has a good specificity for gastric cancer, with a correlation to the neoplasia's extension. It is used to identify relapses {{of the disease and}} to follow up the treatment.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Colon {{cancer is}} the second most common cause of cancer mortality. Ovarian {{cancer is the}} most common {{gynecologic}} malignancy cause of death in women. A labeled monoclonal antibody attaches to a tumor-asso-ciated antigen and allows these tumor masses to be imaged or treated, depending on the radionuclide used. lndium- 111 <b>satumomab</b> pendetide was the first labeled monoclonal an-tibody to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for tumor imaging. It is reactive with most colorectal and ovarian cancers, as well as other cancers. After reading this article, the technologist will understand the FDA approval process, phase trial results, safety and adverse reactions, human antimurine antibody response, indications, imaging protocol, and strengths and weak-nesses of imaging with <b>satumomab</b> pendetide. Representa-tive cases are presented. Key Words: indium- 111 <b>satumomab</b> pendetide; indium- 111 OncoScint Â® CR-OV; monoclonal antibody; radionuclide tu...|$|E
